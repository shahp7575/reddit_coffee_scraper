1j1b569,https://www.reddit.com/r/acidreflux/comments/1j1b569/might_have_found_the_fix/,Might have found the fix!!!,"So here’s my story, November 2024 I had one of the most difficult times of my life without knowing what exactly it would be. It all started over a hungover early morning after drinking some coffee and a coke that turned into a acid reflux/anxiety attack (yes I made a huge mistake taking in so much caffeine and sugar at the same time rather than just take water to cure a hungover) nonetheless after that moment my life wasn’t the same and it was probably more assuming that anything that had sugar or caffeine would give me another episode. (And no I do not have high blood pressure , cholesterol, diabetes or etc) As days passed I began to not sleep well having to keep my wife up late not knowing what to do even after I stopped taking sugar , caffeine and changing my diet completely) i then decided to FINALLY go to the clinic , Long story short I was diagnosed with ACID REFLUX & ANXIETY… I then of course got prescribed with 20g of Omeprazole and Buspirone daily for 3 months. Did it help ? Absolutely, I felt a difference but not all goes away I had some good days and bad days but I did see a difference. A lot of things have changed such as my eating habits, not eating late , drinking to a minimum, 1 coffee a day , not so much sugar (which what triggers my acid reflux) I try to exercise at least 3 times a week, I drink ALOT of water , I take care of my body over all, take 7 different times of vitamins (that I can provide information about) I take a LIVE PROBIOTIC liquid supplement (that can also provide info on) keep in mind im only 30 years old. 
I then decided to seek for different way to help me with this issue. I came across a ACUPUNCTURE office and I decided to call and make an appointment.. today I can officially say I’ve been off Omeprazole and my anxiety medication for 3 days now and kept my diet and I FEEL GREAT !!! it’s been 8 weeks doing acupuncture and it has completely changed my life. (Do I get symptoms when I eat shitty or drink a lot) yes of course but the feeling of having to “live normal” has completely become a reality again.

After all this I came to a conclusion that all bodies changed after 30 and of course after giving our body a shit diet for over 20+ years there will be a day when the body will reject it.. my lifestyle is so much different now after this happened to me but being off medication is a HUGE improvement ! There’s hope out there guys ,  im not saying this will work for everyone but we all spend money on dumb things so why not invest money on health. 

(If anyone is interested in vitamins , probiotic and diet I take I will gladly share it) ",1,1740866878.0,acidreflux,0,1.0,False
1j1b19c,https://www.reddit.com/r/SMG4/comments/1j1b19c/meggy_vs_marios_deadly_avatar_powers/,Meggy vs Mario’s deadly avatar powers,"I’ve recently watched the latest episode of smg4 called [It’s a me](https://youtu.be/eaBtl9uGfUQ?si=WoLe-D-ZRtB7xGKa), where Mario scares smg4 and smg3, and I am a bit surprised that Mario had such unique powers.

He was able to use it on the two as revenge for a scary prank and nearly killed them and also nearly destroyed the castle and coffee shop. He even managed to break out of the bed he was chained on, while smg4 and smg3 tried to exorcise him. He also turned into a biblically accurate Angel just to show how dangerously powerful he is. I theorized that because Mario is the avatar of smg4’s universe he has access to unique powers and very powerful abilities like the ones you see in “It’s a me”.

I imagine Mario would’ve done the same thing to Meggy if she treats him badly one day. It would start with Meggy yelling at him and mistreating, before Mario would start to viciously torment her with his powers. Meggy is very smart and would normally adapt to any situations and even find a solution to every problem she‘s in. She also has same good fighting skills to help take down her enemies and opponents. However because of Mario‘s unpredictable powers and abilities, Meggy would not be able to avoid him, find him, or even defeat him, because of his crazy powers and abilities. Even if she manages to beat him up or trap him, Mario would use the abilities from “it’s a me“ to escape his confines or get back up again. Yelling or treating Mario badly would only get Mario more angrier and upset to the point where he would use more of his powers against her. Meggy would then become terrified when she realized that nothing is working and that everything she tried didn’t work and would eventually run for her life while being scared and terrified, with Mario pursuing and tormenting her. She’s eventually cornered and realize that she has no where else to go. Mario would also turn into his biblically accurate Angel form to show her how truly terrifying he is. Meggy would then realize that this all happened because she yelled at Mario and treated him badly and that the only way to stop this is to apologize to him. Meggy would then apologize to him for treating him very badly and promises not to do it again. Mario would then take a photo of meggy’s terrified face before turning back to normal. He would then laugh and take a few photos while Meggy frozen in terror of what happened. Mario then warns and threatens her that if she yells at him and treat him very badly, then he’ll use his powers to torment her again before Mario walks away. Still frozen in terror and shock of what she has witnessed and experienced, she fell over and laid on the ground.

Anyways I hope you enjoy my concept idea of what would happen to Meggy if Mario used his special powers on her. This is something interesting I came up with after watching “it’s a me”. What do you think he would do to Meggy if he had his powers from the episode “it’s a me”.

It has been fueling the entrepreneurial fire I've always had in me.

I want to create spaces that bring people together in a natural, effortless way by offering both energy and escape. While I’m based in Canada, I hope these concepts could thrive anywhere. I’ve even used AI to visualize my ideas: [Oasis by the Ocean & Console Games Bar](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGgXo2_G5Q/ie1ntShUcY6I8Mq4cxloHw/view?utm_content=DAGgXo2_G5Q&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=viewer).

# An Oasis by the Ocean

Not just a café. A sanctuary. I want to create an accessible and immersive retreat where people can truly unwind, slow down, and connect.

A book-filled hideaway with canopies, cozy pods, and ocean waves in the background. Sip coffee, get lost in a novel, or challenge a friend to a board game.

At night, it transforms into a social screening lounge. We have sports bars, but where’s the TV streaming bar? Imagine binge-watch nights, reality TV reactions, and cult classic marathons in a space designed for comfort, ambient lighting, and a shared experience over the shows we all love.

To support local creatives, I’d host daily events, including:

* Acoustic music nights & open mics
* Wine & paint nights
* Pottery & creative workshops
* Journaling & poetry gatherings
* Sunset yoga & breathwork sessions

# A Console Games Bar

My partner is a gamer, and we’ve both noticed that gaming can be quite an isolated experience. Imagine a space with every console game ever—where connection matters as much as gameplay.

That’s the vision for a gaming-themed bar—open only at night—that transforms gaming into an immersive, shared experience.

The vibe? A refined, welcoming space—part high-end mancave, part modern social club. Not an arcade, but an elevated gaming experience.

**The Space**

* **Classic Zone** – N64, Sega Genesis, PlayStation 1 & 2
* **Retro Arcade** – SNES, GameCube, Wii, OG Xbox
* **Modern Lounge** – PS5, Xbox Series X, high-end PCs
* **VR Zone** – Fully immersive next-gen gaming

**The Menu**

* **Game-themed cocktails** – Creeper Cocktails, Rift Herald Rum Runners, Chug Jug Coolers
* **Dishes inspired by franchises** – Elden Rings of Onion, Wraith Wraps, Boogie Bomb BBQ Wings

**Events & Tournaments**: Smash Bros. battles, Mario Kart races, etc.

# Why I’m Posting

I know that plenty of people have already executed similar concepts. But I want to bring my own vision to life because these spaces are missing in many communities or are inaccessible in terms of cost and location.

Starting something like this takes more than just an idea—it takes planning, funding, and the right people. I’m ready to put together a solid business plan and want to hear from those who have built something from the ground up.

1j1az7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1j1az7y/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1j1aywt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j1aywt/is_this_psychological_abuse_or_normal_breakup/,Is this psychological abuse or normal break-up behaviour?,"I (29F) ended up hooking with a good friend (41M) a few times after nights out, and on a few other sober occasions, maybe six times over about 18 months. Besides hooking up we were part of a good friendship group, hung out almost weekly, went on holidays together (just as friends). After we hooked up a few times he said he didn't want to hook up anymore, he valued our friendship too much to ruin it with sex, which I respected and appreciated and it never came up again. 

About six months later he just stopped replying to my texts, for a few weeks before I felt like something was up, just because he was a bit off with me, but didn't think much of it. After three weeks of completely ignoring me, I called him out on it. He told me he had started seeing someone (22F), and that he would 'feel uncomfortable if people who knew we slept together saw us out together', that he was in a new relationship and I 'should treat him like he has a girlfriend' (he wasn't in a new relationship, this girl was sleeping with three other men including him, and I only ever treated him like I would any other friend), that 'we weren't the good friends I thought we were'. When I said how can you say that you know all of my secrets, he replied 'well ive probably forgotten them', he also accused me of telling people we were seeing each other which is completely inaccurate. I'd spent years denying anything at all was happening between us, I think it was actually just jealous chat from the 22 year old he was interested in. 

It's been 18 months and the repercussions of the things he said to me still haunt me, I valued his friendship a lot and felt completely humiliated by the things he said. He accused me of twisting his words, of catastrophising the situation, 

In the last 18 months he's realised this girl wasn't into him but hasn't ever apologised for the things he said. I've reached out a few times and we've had a coffee once or twice but he's never instigated a conversation, despite sometimes responding positively when I have. In the last six months though whenever I've text he's shut the message down instantly - say a few of us are getting dinner i've invited him and he's just respond 'sorry I'm busy then', but if he knows I'm not going to an event he'll show up. Its like minor aggression, like not following back on social media despite following everyone else, walking into a room at work and all I get is a 'hello' and he'll make small talk with people he doesn't know, he doesn't acknowledge me at all sometimes. 

I don't really know what to do, I've said to a few other friends in the group about things that happened and they've just responded 'I hate it when friends fight' and said nothing else', I just feel like its such a personalised and silent attack and nobody can see it. I don't want to loose my friendship group but I'm also terrified of him. I don't want to make small talk with him when he so clearly let me know what he thinks of me, and I'm also scared to tell him anything because the last time I trusted him he completely destroyed me and our friendship over absolutely nothing.

1j1axxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/1j1axxn/how_to_prepare_and_approach_hiking_the/,How to Prepare and Approach Hiking the Appalachian Trail,"For anyone who is interested, this is the advice I would give my past Self on how to prepare and approach hiking the Appalachian Trail. Everyone is different so take as little or as much of this advice that benefits you.

*“I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.”- Henry David Thoreau*

Approach the Appalachian Trail one day, one breath, one moment at a time. Besides planning ahead your next food and water resupply, just go with the flow of the Trail. Do not stress or have anxiety about the future and make peace with the past. Be present, have fun, do not have expectations, prioritize taking care of your body by stretching and getting sufficient sleep, nutrients, and water. Enjoy the journey and trust the process.

You do not have to have it all figured out. You will make adjustments and adapt. You can accelerate this process by being open-minded and learning from others. Everyone you meet knows something you do not. Ask questions and listen more than you talk, you have two ears and one mouth for a reason.

A great way to approach hiking the Appalachian Trail is to start late March/early April at Springer Mountain, Georgia. The quickest way to get to Springer Mountain is to walk 1 mile south from Big Stamp Gap, USFS 42. You can get water at a stream 2.7 miles into the Trail that is 0.1 miles before Stover Creek Shelter. Bring 2-5 days of food to get you 31 miles to Neels Gap where you can resupply again. The Appalachian Trail is a spiritual journey, not a spiritual destination. Do not worry about hitting “X” number of miles every day as each day will be unique and have a different set of conditions. 15 miles in the White Mountains is WAY HARDER than 15 miles in Georgia. If you can, have no deadline except for Baxter State Park (Where Katahdin is located) deadline of October 15^(th) to complete your thru-hike. $1,000 per month is a borderline decent way to describe how expensive completing a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail is, however, this is all based on one’s material needs and wants. Download the app FarOut and buy (cost around \~60ish bucks) and download all the maps of the Appalachian Trail offline. Take pictures of the people you are with. You will miss and remember the people way more than the views. Enjoy the journey and have fun.

Be prepared and have efficient and effective gear. Here is the gear I had with me when I finished my thru-hike:

At Neels Gap resupply with enough food to take you 38 miles (3-5 days) to Mile 69 (Nice) where the Hostel Around the Bend is. Take a zero (Recovery Day) at the hostel and go check out the towns of Clayton and Hiawassee.  Neels Gap and Hostel Around the Bend are two great spots to adjust your gear and add/drop gear. These are also two great spots to talk to a lot of dope, genuine people and acquire wisdom for your journey ahead.

Two years ago, I completed a northbound thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. About 2 months before I started my thru-hike, I joined the Appalachian Trail Facebook group and Reddit subreddit to help me prepare for my journey.

 

You drink from the well, you must replenish the well.

 

This post is based on my real-life experience of spending 193 days hiking northbound on the Appalachian Trail. I am not here to tell you what to do. I am here to share stories, insights, and philosophies that can be objectively understood, and if you choose, subjectively adopted, by either changing your reality or how you perceive it. Everyone is different so take as little or as much of this advice that benefits you.

A very quick summary on how I found myself on the Appalachian Trail…About three years ago, I did not get the job I really wanted. My cousin hiked the AT in 2016 and it has been on my mind ever since. I knew that I wanted to hike the AT at some point in my life, and I realized that this was a great opportunity for me to do so. The only reason I could not hike the AT would be whatever BS excuse that I could come up with.

 

I called my cousin and told her that I wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail.

She responded, “F\*\*K YES! Do it.”

Then she gave me two GREAT pieces of wisdom:

1.     Do not listen to the haters

My cousin warned me that a lot of people will “call you crazy” or “question your decision.” Pay attention to who these people are… there is a good chance they have never done something this dope and adventurous in their life. Do not let these people talk you out of it. If you ask anyone who has done a thru-hike of a long trail, they will tell you that this is an amazing opportunity to find your true self and grow. SEND IT

2.     Last one to Katahdin wins

Hiking the Appalachian Trail is a spiritual journey… not a spiritual destination. The journey is where all the personal growth happens. You are doing yourself a huge disservice by rushing the AT. Stop and smell the roses as much as you can, do not worry about hitting X number of miles every day. However, you still must hike \~2,200 miles so you can’t smell the roses for too long.

 

Honestly, completing a northbound thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail is very simple.

1.     Go to Springer Mountain in Georgia

2.     Walk north to Mount Katahdin in Maine

3.     Climb Mount Katahdin

You do not necessarily need to hike the AT northbound. You could do it southbound or a flip flop of the two. As someone wise once said… hike your own hike.

I, and most thru-hikers that I met, agreed that three of the most beautiful states of the AT are Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Vermont is a vibe, the Whites in New Hampshire are EPIC, and Maine is the Maine Event. Saving the “best” for last and ending your spiritual journey on Katahdin… is a great way to approach the Appalachian Trail.

Here are two insights that may help you approach the Appalachian Trail:

1.     Do not have a deadline

Remember it is about the journey, not the destination. Ideally, the only deadline you should have for completing the AT is October 15^(th). That is the day Baxter State Park (Where Katahdin is located) recommends you finish by. They usually close the park the week of October 15^(th)\-22^(nd) when the weather turns bad. For 2022, the park closed on October 20^(th).  Be aware that there is potential the park will close before October 15^(th) if the weather gets bad.

I would give yourself at least 6 months to hike the Appalachian Trail. I think the sweet spot to start your thru-hike at Springer Mountain is April 1^(st) – April 15^(th). You avoid questionable March weather by waiting until April, but then give yourself 6 months to get your ass to Katahdin. If you need or want more time than 6 months, start sometime sooner in March.

2.     Have enough money

$1,000 per month is a borderline decent way to describe how expensive completing a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail is. It is not necessarily hard to spend less than that per month, but it is EASY to spend more than that a month. A lot of this is personal preference based on your material wants and needs. I was strict with myself spending money on hostels/hotels but would ball out on food and beer.

Picture this situation: it is mid-September and two thru-hikers have 200 miles left to complete their thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail when a HUGE STORM starts to roll in.

Hiker A who has no deadline but October 15^(th) and has enough money, decides to drop 30 bucks and get a bunk at one of the nearby trail hostels. Hiker A spends the day during the storm, resting their body and drinking beers with other thru-hikers from around the world.

Hiker B who has a deadline of September 27^(th) for “X” reason and does not have enough money, decides to hike through the torrential downpour because they are low on time and money.

There is no right or wrong option.

Hiker A is not necessarily “smarter” or more “successful” than Hiker B.

Hiker B is not necessarily “stronger” than Hiker A.

 

Be conscious and aware of the two options for this situation when hiking the AT.

 

Two Equations that will help you approach the Appalachian Trail:

 

**1.     Stress + Rest = Growth**

 

Stress = Stimulus (Physical, mental, spiritual)

Example: A hiker physically hikes 17 miles, mentally plans where they will be getting water, and spiritually connects with life throughout the day.

It is important to note that stress can be beneficial.

I prepared physically for the AT by hiking with my backpack on, running, and yoga (YouTube yoga with Adrienne).

I prepared mentally and spiritually for the AT by meditating (I use the app Insight Timer), reading books, and talking to thru-hikers.

If you read one book before hiking the AT make it Appalachian Trials by Zach Davis.

Rest = Recovery (Sleep, nutrition, water, stretching)

Example: A hiker recovers by stretching, drinking 2 liters of water, eating 1,000 calories at dinner, and getting 9 hours of sleep.

If you are aspiring to grow as a human being on the AT, you need to prioritize recovery. Make sure your body is getting sufficient water, calories, and sleep. Be proactive about drinking water, I would slug a bunch of water whenever I was filling up my bottles. Be proactive about consuming enough calories, I would always make sure I had plenty of food to eat every day. Be proactive about getting sleep. I never set an alarm on the trail and let my body wake up naturally to make sure I was well rested. It was awesome letting my body go into a Circadian rhythm with the sun.

Balance of stress and rest is key for sustainable growth. Too much stress and not enough rest leads to burnout and fatigue. Too much rest and not enough stress leads to complacency and laziness.

**2.     Happiness = Reality – Expectations**

DO NOT HAVE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL.

Being prepared and having expectations are different. Embrace reality and go with the flow.

*“Do not fight the Trail. You have to flow with it. Be cooperative with the Trail, neither competitive nor combative.” – Warren Doyle*

Here are a few more insights and observations I had on my journey:

Your Big 3 items: backpack, sleeping bag, and tent are like quarterback, left tackle, and pass rusher for an American football team. Do not be afraid to invest in these three, they are worth every penny.

Chaco Sandals are great for the AT as they are a hiking and camp shoe in one. You save weight by only having one pair of footwear and they are great for river crossings. They are not for everyone but I really enjoyed hiking in them.

One of the quickest things I learned on the AT is to carry less water. There were only a handful of times on my thru-hike where I would carry more than 2 liters of water. My approach was usually carrying 1.5 liters of water and stopping every few miles to get water. While getting water I would CHUG A TON OF water, smoke, and eat a snack. Stopping for water is a great way to break up your day hiking and keep you fresh.

Use a big gallon size Ziplock bag as a trash bag for all your wrappers.

I did not bring a portable charger for my phone. I was fine with just a normal charger as I was able to charge my phone at a hostel/grocery store/random place every few days when I resupplied for food. Not having a portable charger forced me to use my phone strategically, which led me to detoxing from my phone and making me more present. The only time I used my phone was for navigation using FarOut and listening to music using Spotify. About once a week I would turn my phone on and text my mom that I was alive and well. Use the trail as an opportunity to disconnect and be in nature.

A friend I met on the AT, Walmart, told me he listens to “The Long Walk” every time he gets to Maine on the trail (He has completed five thru-hikes). I downloaded it on Audible and listened to it while hiking through Maine. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING THIS. Trust me on this. If you have not read/listened to “The Long Walk” by Richard Bachman (pseudonym of Steven King), listen/read it while hiking through Maine. THAT BOOK IS WILD

I also listened to Greenlights by Matthew McConaughey on audible. I really enjoyed listening to McConaughey’s voice talking about his story and his perspective on life.  

As a male thru-hiker, I generally had a harder time hitching rides into town than female thru-hikers. If I had to hitch a ride into town and there was not a female thru-hiker nearby, I would throw on my flannel shirt to make myself look more \~presentable\~

When it was not cold out, I would use my puffy jacket as my pillow. When it was cold and I wore my puffy jacket to bed, I would stuff my hiking clothes into my one sorting bag and use that as a pillow.

I had a contractor garbage bag lining the inside of my backpack. In between the contractor garbage bag and the backpack is where I would keep my tent, rainfly, and tarp. This was very useful when packing up a wet tent in the morning as you could just throw it in your backpack and not worry about it getting any of your other stuff wet.

Playing the Fallout video games helped me approach the Appalachian Trail as it helped me treat the AT like a game. My perspective was that getting to Katahdin was my “Main Quest” and I could do any “Side Quest” I wanted too. I could level up skills and attributes that I wanted to get better at. I was exploring new locations on the map. I added companions to play the game with. My iPhone was my Pip-Boy. I could add and drop items of gear. The Fallout Radio playlist on Spotify HIT DIFFERENT on the AT. Treat the Appalachian Trail like a game and play it however you want too.

My favorite hostels I stayed at on the Trail were the Hostel Around the Bend, Kincora, Woodshole, Small Axe Farms, the Yellow Deli, Maine Roadhouse, and Shaws.

Name your backpack, it deserves the respect.

Trail Days, an annual AT festival, takes place on May 16th – May 18th in Damascus, Virginia which is mile 470 of the Appalachian Trail. The community and energy at this festival cannot be describe with words in the English language. I highly recommend going, or at least stopping by and checking it out. “Hiking into Trail Days” while hiking the AT is a LEGENDARY MOVE.

If you need a shuttle driver to get you to Springer Mountain, I used Ron… he is the fricken man! His number is 706-669-0919

If I had 50ish miles in between two food resupplies, I would get food for 3 dinners and 4 days of breakfast, lunch, and snacks. I estimated that I would get to the next food resupply at night of the third day or sometime before dinner on the 4^(th) day. Based on looking at FarOut and talking to other thru-hikers, I would make “loose plans.” Here are a few examples:

·       There is a shelter where I can order pizza at in 33 miles, not a bad idea to spend tomorrow night there.

·       Tomorrow there are Trail Angels handing out Trail Magic 7 miles from where I am. So I am going to have a quick morning and rip it 7 miles and then take a long siesta at the Trail Magic stop

·       I am 21 miles from Woodshole. Tomorrow I am going to get an early start and end my day at Woodshole and then take a zero the day after.

I journaled every day on the AT. I am very happy with my past Self for recording my adventure as I can now look back at it for the rest of my life. You are doing yourself a disservice by not journaling your ideas, thoughts, and observations as you grow as a human being on the AT. You will not remember every unique idea and thought you have so it is important to be able to record them somewhere. I did not use my phone for a journal as I prefer to write in a tangible notebook as I find it very therapeutic and meditative. I also was trying to detox as much as possible from my phone and get quality sleep (Phone before bed is bad for sleep). A lot of the stories, insights, and philosophies in this post come from my journal.

It does not take one day to complete a thru-hike, do not let one day take you off.

Take pictures of the people you are with. You will miss and remember the people way more than the views. Please read this one again, it is very important.

Approach the Appalachian Trail one day, one moment at a time. Besides planning ahead your next food and water resupply, just go with the flow of the Trail. Do not stress or have anxiety about the future and make peace with the past. Be present, have fun, do not have expectations, prioritize taking care of your body by stretching and getting sufficient sleep, nutrients, and water. Enjoy the journey and trust the process.

“In a world increasingly devoid of restraint, President Zelensky’s ability to not leap across the Resolute Desk and put Mr. Vance in a headlock is a triumph for peace,” read the official statement from the Committee. “We are inspired by his Gandhi-like patience in the face of condescension.”

The now-infamous meeting, which started as a discussion on diplomacy and minerals, reportedly spiraled into a passive-aggressive lecture from Vance, who suggested that Ukraine’s ongoing war effort was a sign of poor decision-making rather than, say, an unavoidable invasion by a nuclear-armed neighbor. Witnesses say Zelensky’s eye twitched only slightly before he took a deep breath, presumably counted to ten, and refrained from testing whether his military training would allow him to suplex the Vice President through the nearest coffee table.

Political analysts have lauded Zelensky’s ability to remain seated while being told he should be “grateful” for Trump’s peace efforts, especially given that these efforts primarily involve demanding Ukraine surrender and suggesting Russia would be “a great trading partner” under new management.

Reached for comment, President Zelensky humbly downplayed his nomination. “I was merely exercising self-control,” he said. “Also, I didn't want to get tackled by Secret Service.”

Vice President Vance, meanwhile, dismissed the honor as “globalist nonsense,” stating, “If Zelensky truly wanted peace, he would have thanked me for my advice, and maybe even given me one of those cool military jackets he wears.”

The Nobel Peace Prize Committee is expected to announce the winner later this year. Other contenders reportedly include an 8 year old from Finland who shared his lunch with a classmate and the Dalai Lama, who did not respond to China’s latest threats with an MMA challenge.

1j1aqq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j1aqq2/aitah_for_not_letting_my_friendturnedlover_36f/,AITAH For not letting my Friend-Turned-Lover (36f) read through my (37f) Private folder even if she would never allow me to see hers? Help appreciated..,"9 months ago I met Clara (not her name).  We were both at the end of divorcing abusive partners and leaving unhealthy marriages.  I have a rough background with alcoholism and have been clean for almost 10 years.  My drinking certainly helped ruin my marriage and I've since gotten help and kept a tight grip on my life by staying sober and working on myself. She has Borderline Personality disorder and as she was working through her issues with a therapist,  when her husband told her that he wasn't attracted any longer and dumped her.
 
We met as we were both separated and found we were good friends. In time, I felt like I found someone truly special. She didn't judge me for my past and we have a really good experience being sweet to each other and learning our rhythms.

For the first 3 months we would talk a lot and get coffee, and generally didn't want to ruin being friends with a ONS. After those 3 months she told me she was in love with me. For the first time in my life, I was really head over heels about someone.  Her quirks and personality made her so radiant to me, and the way we supported each other and laughed together made my heart feel so full.  Recently, I had her keys and would walk her dogs, cook for her when she was sick or tired, and we started thinking of a future for us.

This week, she made my heart jump when she told me she was thinking about getting a place together when our leases were up after this summer.  We'd have been together for almost a year when making that choice, and it felt right.

Here are some relevant details before the events of the other night:
-One of the only times I saw her Borderline issues arise was early on when I changed a song on Spotify using her phone.  She was LIVID that I touched her locked phone to change a song that was accidentally stuck on repeat. She mentioned it a few times for two weeks after it happened.

-I had an awkward rebound post-divorce that ended horribly and with me being ghosted for not being available enough.  This person would turn out to be a friend of my recent ex and it was something we talked through pretty easily.

-Her job is one where it would end her career if anything inappropriate of her were ever leaked.

-I was told to not save temporary pictures she had sent, and I never did.  I respected that boundary.

-As a ""joke"" she screenshotted one of my temporary pictures to her phone and joked about showing her friend.  I wasn't happy about it but let it go.

-If I ever asked to look through her phone, she'd laugh at me.

-I got a new phone last week and am currently moving notes/reminders/work info between the two and haven't had time to finish moving everything over and have kept the old phone around as a backup this week.

Last night we spent the evening together, I read to her and was telling her how beautiful I found her. I mentioned that I made use of replaying her temporary picture the earlier night and she took that to mean that I screenshotted one of her pictures.  She asked for my new phone, promptly opened my media, private folder, and trash.  She found NO pictures of her. I didn't like that she was looking through my files like I would betray her trust.

She then demanded to see my old phone.  The old phone had pictures of my old life, and I hadn't even been ready to open my old private folder and see or delete pictures of my ex-wife, or a couple of pictures sent to me from the unfortunate re-bound who was her friend.  I didn't want her to see that, or any of the porn I had saved while before and during my divorce.

I asked her if she'd do the same for me and she admitted she wouldn't, and that it was a double standard.  I was too ashamed that she'd see old pictures, or pics/videos I took for her but wasn't confident enough to send.

We made dinner, I helped her clean her home, I took her to the store and picked up her dogs, and then she flipped a switch and decided I had copied her pictures.  I didn't want her to see my old private folder, but kind of wish I did.  I miss her so much but felt so shocked that she responded  by throwing me out of her home.  She gave me back most of the little things I had left there and threw me out.  She called me an hour after and talked for a minute before deciding she shouldn't have called and blocked my number, and socials.

I'm devastated and not sure if I should have just let her steamroll me, or if she'll ever want to see me again.  I just hate this is how this ends.  This is how we end after falling in love and getting along in such a deep way.  Is that what we owe those we love?  

Letting them get away with behavior they would never condone? Is it really my fault the relationship is over?  I appreciate all input.

Edit 1 -> She's been in treatment for 2 years and generally does very well most days.  This is the worst flip out I have had with her. She does not currently meet a BPD diagnosis. But she did before therapy/ meds.",2,1740865804.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False
1j1aqj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/1j1aqj3/is_the_sandpiper_case_inspired_by_liebeck_vs/,Is the Sandpiper case inspired by  Liebeck vs McDonald's?,"I'm helping my son with some school work, and I got sucked into the rabbit hole of Liebeck vs. McDonald's. It's from 1992, when 79-year old Stella Liebeck suffered third degree burns from a cup of McDonald's coffee, requiring extensive and expensive medical treatment. The corporation initially offered her $800 in damages, and eventually after two year of litigation she was awarded almost 3 million. The case received global attention. She died in 2004.

ANYWAY, we had both watched Better Call Saul together, and we couldn't quite agree on whether the case had formed some sort of distant inspiration for the Sandpiper case. What do you think? We haven't watched any  interviews or listened to the podcasts- is this case ever mentioned?

Oh- and of course another similarity: Liebeck lived in Albuquerque!   ",0,1740865791.0,betterCallSaul,10,0.33,False

1j1aowk,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1j1aowk/cant_believe_hes_gone/,Can’t believe he’s gone,"My boyfriend (38M) went into cardiac arrest at the gym on the morning of Feb 16 and ended up passing away. He had no known health conditions and always said how healthy he felt. He was very health conscious and worked out about 4 times a week. 
I (35F) am absolutely heartbroken and devastated and all I can think is “what do I do now?” We shared an apartment together and I’m not ready to start packing things up (even though I’m starting to feel pressure from his family and mine to pack and move) Part of me wants to stay but my family support system lives an hour away and my mom has offered to let me move in with her. I’m not sure what to do. I have pretty much this month to decide. Seeing the apartment and his things and the life we had together is comforting somedays but there’s still a big part of my brain that’s expecting him to come home any minute. We had plans to make bacon and coffee for breakfast when he came home from the gym that day and he never came back. 

The most traumatic part was the week in the hospital, not knowing if he was going to wake up and then receiving the news that the CT scan showed severe brain damage with no chance for recovery. 

He was absolutely my person and we had plans to get married and move into a house this year and now it feels like my life is over too. I would always tell him how thankful I was to have met him and that he chose me. I feel so lonely now. 
We have a dog and having her here with me in the apartment has given me a little something to get up for each day. 

It kills me that he taught other people how to do CPR, use an AED, and never hesitated to jump in and help others, but no one at the gym was willing to help him. Life is so unfair and I feel like his family and mine don’t really understand what it’s like to lose a significant other. His family lost a brother and a son but I feel like I lost my whole heart and my whole world is shattered. I can’t believe this is real.

I’ve noticed a pattern in my behavior, and I’m wondering if anyone else experiences this or has advice.  

After work, I always tell myself I won’t buy snacks for the drive home. But once I get in the car, I become obsessed with the idea, convincing myself, *just one more time, then no more.* The craving feels overwhelming, and resisting it makes me feel sad or even angry. However, if I’m driving home at any other time (like on a weekend), I don’t feel the same urge. If I stay home all day, I’m totally fine eating only my planned meals without that overwhelming need to snack.  

Recently, a new coffee shop opened near me, and I started getting coffee a couple of times a week. Now, I go almost every day. I didn’t even drink coffee before! But if the shop closed, I wouldn’t go searching for another one—I’d just stop. However, if a matcha or iced tea shop opened, I feel like I’d get obsessed with that instead.  

My partner thinks I get addicted to things easily. He thought I was addicted to tea because I used to drink seven cups a day, but when I ran out, I didn’t buy more for three months, and I was fine. So I *can* stop, but when something is accessible and part of my routine, I struggle to break away from it.  

Also a few years ago I got into buying online lottery tickets for my countries lottery I thought shit this could be bad. I obsessed over it for like 4 weeks then one day forgot about it and didn’t do it again for like 8 months and was like oh I forgot about the lottery. 

Is this just bad impulse control, or could it be a form of addiction? Has anyone else dealt with something like this?

I’m just so confused. And I know it only takes a few people to start something and the internet goes “baAaAaA 🐑”, but I will forever be so drained by the constant changes in beauty standards. First of all, are they not tired?? All these followers, all this influence, and they use it to take a shot of olive oil followed by sips of bone broth coffee in the morning before Pilates. Girl, you’re not influencing me to do that shit get off my screen. 

Second of all, when did curves become the devil and thin = femininity? Don’t get me wrong, being naturally thin and wanting to be thin is completely normal. But there’s a difference between wanting to be thin versus wanting to be the thin*est*.  That’s when it can get unhealthy and can bring out such toxic tendencies in relation to food and working out. Influencers in this category seek out an unobtainable body and we, the commenters, are to say “wow, if only I could look like you 😍”. And then it’s a cycle where they (and big corporations) can profit off of our insecurities and they can feel superior, or whatever feelings spur them on.

Throughout my childhood, I was veryyyyy tiny bc of constant sports and competitions such as track and cross country. I would get made fun of for the way my body looked such that puberty hit me way later in life lol. At 22, I am consistent at the gym and am proud of my newfound curves and weight gain; but now, my high school body is what’s popular and isn’t that so fucking backwards? I am so tired of weight being a hot topic. If ppl put just as much effort into their character that they put into working out, this world MIGHT just be a better place, or at least less annoying. 

Anyways here’s my I’m-so-tired-everyone-shut-up rant. Also I love this page y’all are so funny. Also influencers should take a chill pill instead of a shot of olive oil and maybe that would help stabilize their bowel movements. ",24,1740865185.0,LAinfluencersnark,8,0.9,False

It seeped into my bones, settling in my marrow like a sickness. I opened my eyes to a fluorescent glare, sterile white walls, the low hum of machinery. A hospital? No, something worse. The air smelled of antiseptic and metal, but beneath it lurked something foul—like burned hair and spoiled meat.

I tried to move. The restraints cut into my wrists and ankles. Panic jolted through me like a live wire.

Where the hell was I?

A voice crackled over an unseen speaker. Male. Clinical. Devoid of anything resembling human warmth.

“Subject 18 C is awake. Increased durability and metabolic response confirmed. Beginning Phase Three.”

A hissing noise. Gas poured in from the vents. My chest clenched as I fought the urge to cough, but the moment I inhaled, something shifted inside me. Heat flooded my limbs, my pulse hammering against my ribs. my muscles burned, stretched—no, not just stretched. Strengthened.

a deep, twisting ache unfurled inside my bones, like something was burrowing through my marrow. My spine felt wrong—too long, too tight, shifting when I moved. A wet, sickening crack echoed through the sterile room, and for a horrible second, I thought it came from my own ribs.

My heart shouldn’t beat this fast. My blood shouldn’t feel alive.

I pulled at the restraints again. This time, the steel didn’t just resist—it bent.

The intercom buzzed again, and for the first time, the voice sounded surprised. “Subject 18 C is exceeding expected thresholds.”

I wasn’t supposed to do this. They thought I’d stay weak, compliant. Human.

A door hissed open. Heavy boots echoed against the floor. Five men in tactical gear stormed in, rifles raised. Their visors reflected the overhead lights, blank and faceless.

“Restrain him.”

One stepped forward, reaching for a syringe. I let him get close. Let him think I was still strapped down.

Then I moved.

I don’t know how to explain what happened next. One second, I was still; the next, I was everywhere. My hands found his wrist before he could react. 

I squeezed, and something inside his arm popped. He screamed, crumpling to the ground.

His wrist didn’t just break—it caved inward. Bone and sinew collapsed with a wet, grinding crunch, jagged splinters stabbing through his skin like exposed ivory fangs. He shrieked, a raw, primal sound—not just pain, but terror. Like he knew, deep down, that I was something worse than him.

The others opened fire.

I should have died.

Instead, I moved faster than I thought possible. The bullets were slow. I could see them in the air, the world dragging as my body surged into overdrive. I twisted, dodging—until something hit me square in the chest.

A tranquilizer.

My legs buckled. The room swam. I collapsed, body numb, mind screaming.

The last thing I heard before the darkness swallowed me was the voice over the speaker. Calm. Almost pleased.

“Let’s see how quickly he recovers.”

I woke up in a different room.

No restraints. No tactical guards. Just a single chair, a steel table, and a man in a suit watching me with calculating eyes.

He folded his hands. “You’re adjusting faster than expected.”

I didn’t answer. My body still felt off—wired, too strong. But I wasn’t about to give him the satisfaction of knowing that.

He leaned forward. “You’re an asset now, Subject 18 C. A weapon. We can help you refine your abilities. Give you purpose.”

I stared at him. “And if I refuse?”

The corner of his mouth twitched. “You won’t.”

A silent threat.

A promise.

I could have run.

The thought burned in the back of my mind as I stared at the man in the suit. The door was ten feet away. My body thrummed with power I barely understood, instincts screaming at me to move, to tear my way out.

But I forced myself to breathe. To think.

They’d be expecting me to run.

So instead, I leaned back in my chair, flexing my fingers experimentally. The residual strength lingered in my muscles, the memory of that fight still fresh. If they wanted me to play along? Fine. I’d play their game—until I understood the rules.

I met his gaze. “I’m listening.”

A smile. Small. Knowing. Like he had already won.

“Good,” he said. “Welcome to The Division.”

They trained me fast over the next few years.

I learned about The Division—a black-budget organization buried so deep in the government that not even the Pentagon could trace their funding. Their job? Containment. Eradication. Hunting things that shouldn’t exist.

Cryptids. Aberrations. Creatures that had no place in this world.

I was part of Project Revenant, one of a handful of subjects enhanced through genetic augmentation and experimental procedures. The goal wasn’t just super-soldiers. It was adaptation. Something that could go toe-to-toe with the things hiding in the dark and win.

The first few months were hell. They pushed my body to its limits, testing my durability, my strength, my reflexes. I learned that I could take bullets and keep moving. My metabolism worked on overdrive, healing injuries in hours, not days. My senses sharpened—I could hear a heartbeat from across a room, see in the dark like it was daylight.

But I wasn’t immortal.

I could be hurt. I could be killed.

And the things I hunted? They were stronger. Smarter. Older.

My first mission wasn’t a test.

It was a baptism.

A small town in Montana. Isolated. Surrounded by dense forest. People had been going missing for months, but the bodies that turned up weren’t just corpses. They were emptied. Hollowed out like something had burrowed inside them and eaten its way out.

The locals whispered about the Skin Man.

The reports called it an Atypical Class-4 Predator.

I called it a monster.

They sent me in with a team. Five seasoned operatives, all of them hardened, professional. I was the rookie. The experiment. The one they weren’t sure would make it back.

By the time the night was over, I was the only one still breathing.

The Skin Man wasn’t just fast. It was impossibly fast. It moved through the trees like a shadow, limbs too long, joints bending the wrong way.

Its skin didn’t stretch—it rippled. Muscles twitched beneath the surface like trapped rats, tendons snapping into new positions with a wet, suctioning pop. When it grinned, its jaw unhinged, revealing rows of uneven, needle-thin teeth, clacking together as if they were laughing at me.

Bullets barely slowed it down. Fire worked better.

But I learned something else that night.

I wasn’t just stronger than before.

I was something else.

When it lunged at me, something deep in my brain—something primal—clicked.

The world slowed. My body moved on instinct, dodging before I could even process the attack. My hands found its throat. I crushed it. Felt the cartilage snap beneath my grip.

And for one terrible moment—one awful, exhilarating second—I enjoyed it.

The fire inside me wasn’t just strength. It was hunger.

I buried that feeling deep.

Burned the Skin Man’s corpse.

Told myself I was still human.

The Years That Followed

They kept sending me into the field.

Every mission, a new nightmare.

	•	A creature in the Appalachians that mimicked voices, luring hikers off the trail, only for their bones to turn up weeks later—picked clean.

	•	An abandoned bunker where something not quite human still roamed the halls, whispering in a dozen different voices.

	•	A coastal town plagued by a “disease” that left its victims bloated and brimming with writhing things just beneath their skin.

I fought. I survived. I changed.

Every mission left its mark. Scars I should have healed from. Memories I couldn’t erase.

I told myself I was doing the right thing. That The Division was keeping the world safe.

But some nights, when I looked in the mirror, I saw something else.

Not a hero.

Not even a soldier.

Just a man slowly becoming what he hunted.

The job changed me.

Not just in the obvious ways. Yeah, I was stronger. Faster. I healed from wounds that should’ve been fatal. But there was something else—something deeper. I didn’t just hunt monsters.

I was starting to understand them.

I could hear them before I saw them. Feel them in the air, like their presence pressed against some part of me I couldn’t explain. And sometimes—just for a second—I swore I could think like them.

I chalked it up to instincts. Experience. The kind of thing that happens when you spend years tracking things that shouldn’t exist.

But now, I’m not so sure.

Because last night, I found something I wasn’t supposed to.

And today, I met a monster that knew my name.

It started with a mission. A simple containment op—or at least, that’s what they told me.

A Category 5 Anomaly had appeared outside an abandoned hospital in rural Wyoming. The locals never saw it, just heard the sounds—guttural, inhuman shrieking, followed by long stretches of silence. The Division classified it as a Spectral Aberration, some kind of semi-corporeal entity drawn to places of suffering.

I’d handled things like that before.

But this time, they weren’t sending a team.

Just me.

Alone.

That should’ve been my first clue.

The hospital was a corpse of a building. Hollow. Decayed. The walls were covered in years of mold and neglect, the floor sagging with rot. The air smelled thick, wet—like something had been festering here for years.

But I wasn’t alone.

I could feel it.

The weight of something watching me, the electric tingle in my spine that always came before a fight.

I moved carefully, stepping through the ruined hallways, my flashlight beam cutting through the dark. My breath sounded too loud in the silence.

Then I found the room.

The door was already open, barely hanging on its hinges. Inside, the walls were covered in old, yellowed papers—Division files. Some of them so decayed they crumbled at my touch.

But one caught my eye.

A sealed case file. Thick. Intact. Marked with a single name.

Project Revenant.

My stomach twisted.

This was my project.

My file.

I flipped it open, skimming pages filled with dense government jargon. Test results. Biological analysis. But the deeper I read, the colder I felt.

Subject #18 C exhibits unprecedented neural adaptation to foreign genetic sequences.

Metabolic responses suggest latent compatibility with nonhuman physiology.

New projections implies Subject can lift up to a few tons and healing ability will increase over time further testing will be needed.

Further mutations expected. Long-term psychological effects unknown.

And then—one line.

A single note scribbled in the margins.

The others didn’t survive. But he did. Why?

My blood ran cold.

The others?

I never knew there were others.

My breath came faster, heartbeat pounding in my ears. I turned another page— medical images. MRIs. Bone scans. A body that should’ve been mine but wasn’t quite.

The skull too thick. The ribcage subtly wrong. The fingers elongated, with faint traces of—

No.

I slammed the file shut. My hands were shaking.

I needed to leave.

Then the voice came.

From behind me.

Low. Familiar. Wrong.

“You weren’t supposed to find that.”

I spun, gun raised.

And froze.

The thing standing in the doorway wasn’t human.

At first glance, it looked like a man—tall, broad-shouldered, wearing what might have once been a Division field uniform. But the flesh wasn’t right. It moved too much. Like something beneath the skin was constantly shifting, adjusting, trying to find the right shape.

Its eyes locked onto mine.

And it smiled.

“Hello, brother.”

The words hit me like a gunshot.

I didn’t answer. Couldn’t.

The thing chuckled, tilting its head. “You don’t remember, do you?”

I steadied my aim. “I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.”

The thing exhaled, something between a sigh and a rattle. “They always wipe the memories. Makes it easier when the failures start stacking up.”

My grip tightened. “Failures?”

“You think you’re the first?” It gestured vaguely to itself. “There were twelve of us before you. Revenants. Some lasted days. Others, weeks. Me?” A twisted grin. “I lasted years. Until they decided I wasn’t ‘human’ enough anymore.”

I shook my head. No. This was a trick. A lie.

“I don’t believe you.”

The thing took a slow step forward. The shadows clung to it, like the darkness itself was bending around its form.

“Then why do you feel it?” It gestured at me, at my hands—where the veins pulsed faintly under my skin, darkened with something not quite normal.

I swallowed hard.

It leaned in. “You’ve noticed it, haven’t you? The instincts. The way you can track them. The hunger.”

I didn’t answer.

Because I had.

For years, I had buried it. Ignored the way I could sense the things we hunted. The way my body moved before my brain could react. The flickers of something else inside me.

“Get out of my way,” I said, voice low.

The thing laughed. “You don’t get it, do you? I’m not your enemy. They are.”

The Division.

The people who turned me into this.

The people who lied to me.

For the first time, I hesitated.

The thing—the other Revenant—tilted its head. Watching me. Waiting.

Then, from far off, I heard it.

The sound of helicopters

The Division was coming.

I didn’t lower my gun.

The thing—the Revenant—watched me with something almost like amusement. It knew I was considering its words. That somewhere, deep down, I was listening.

But I forced myself to focus.

“Get on your knees,” I said. “Hands behind your head.”

The Revenant’s grin widened. “Still playing the good little soldier, huh?” It took another slow step forward. “You think they’ll pat you on the head after this? Tell you what a good job you did?”

I adjusted my aim. “I won’t ask again.”

A chuckle. Deep. Wrong. “God, they really did a number on you.”

The distant rumble of helicopters grew louder. The Division was closing in. I had minutes before this place was swarming with armed operatives.

The Revenant knew it too.

Its expression shifted, the amusement fading. Something colder settled into its voice. “I get it, you know. You need to believe you’re still one of them. That all the things you’ve done—the things they made you do—meant something.”

My jaw tightened. “Shut up.”

“You ever wonder why they keep sending you alone?” It gestured to the ruined hospital around us. “Why they don’t put you on teams anymore?”

I said nothing.

Because I had wondered.

At first, I thought it was because I was their best. Their most capable. But lately, the missions had started to feel different.

Like they weren’t just testing my skills.

Like they were watching me.

The Revenant’s eyes flicked to my hands. “You’ve noticed it, haven’t you? The strength. The instincts. The way you can feel them before you see them.”

I forced my hands to stay steady.

“That’s not training,” it said. “That’s them.”

I didn’t ask what it meant. I didn’t have to.

I already knew.

The experiments didn’t just make me stronger. They made me like them.

Like the things I hunted.

“You can still fight it,” I said, trying to ignore the doubt curling in my chest. “Turn yourself in. Maybe they can fix you.”

The Revenant laughed.

“Fix me?” It shook its head. “You really don’t get it. They did this to me, same as they did it to you. But the second I stopped looking human enough, I was disposable.”

I swallowed hard.

“You think you’re any different?” It took another step forward, slow and deliberate. “They’re just waiting for you to slip. For the day you stop pretending. Then they’ll put you down like the rest of us.”

I clenched my teeth. “I’m not like you.”

A beat of silence.

Then, the Revenant spoke—low, quiet, almost pitying.

“…Then why are you afraid?”

I pulled the trigger.

The first shot hit center mass. The Revenant staggered but didn’t fall.

The second shot took it in the shoulder.

It growled—a deep, inhuman sound—but still, it smiled.

“There he is,” it murmured. “The real you.”

I didn’t stop.

I emptied the clip, every shot tearing through its shifting, unnatural flesh. It twitched. Jerked. But it didn’t fall.

I reached for my sidearm, but it was already moving.

One second, it was across the room. The next, it was in my face.

A hand—too strong, too fast—closed around my throat.

And for the first time in years, I felt weak.

It lifted me off the ground like I weighed nothing. My fingers scrabbled against its grip, my legs kicking, lungs burning. I brought my knee up, aiming for its ribs, but it barely reacted.

Its face was close now, those unnatural eyes boring into mine.

“You feel it, don’t you?” it whispered.

My vision blurred at the edges.

“That thing inside you?”

Darkness pressed in.

“It’s waking up.”

Then—gunfire.

A single, deafening shot.

The Revenant’s grip loosened.

I hit the ground, gasping.

Through the haze, I saw it staggering back.

A hole had been punched clean through its skull

It didn’t die right away. Its head snapped backward at an impossible angle, a deep, sickening gurgle escaping its throat. The hole where its brain should’ve been bubbled, dark fluid seeping out in sluggish rivers. It swayed, twitching like a dying insect, fingers curling in on themselves as if trying to hold onto something unseen. And then, finally, it fell.

And standing behind it—pistol raised—was Director Carter.

The Revenant tried to speak, but all that came out was a wet, gurgling choke.

Then, slowly, it collapsed.

Its body convulsed once. Then twice.

Then it stopped moving.

The room fell into silence, broken only by the distant whir of approaching helicopters.

I pushed myself up, still dazed, throat raw. Carter lowered his weapon, studying the corpse like it was nothing more than an old experiment finally put down.

“Didn’t think you’d need backup,” he said.

I wiped blood from my mouth. “I had it under control.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Did you?”

I said nothing.

Because the truth was, I wasn’t sure.

Carter holstered his gun, turning toward the door as the first wave of Division operatives flooded in.

“Clean this up,” he ordered. “Burn it.”

I watched as they moved in, securing the scene, already treating the Revenant like it had never even existed.

Like it was never human.

And maybe it wasn’t.

Maybe it was just another monster. Another target. Another mission.

So why couldn’t I shake the feeling that it was right?

I was debriefed. The mission was labeled a success.

Carter didn’t ask what the Revenant said to me.

I didn’t tell him I found the file.

But later that night, when I stripped off my gear and looked at myself in the mirror, I saw something I hadn’t noticed before.

The bruises on my throat were already fading.

The pain was already gone.

Faster than it should’ve been.

I flexed my fingers, watching the veins beneath my skin.

I wasn’t like them.

I was still human.

The moment I walked into Carter’s office, I knew I wasn’t leaving as the same man.

Maybe I wasn’t leaving at all.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting long shadows across the polished steel walls. Carter sat behind his desk, fingers steepled, his expression unreadable. A thick folder rested in front of him, its edges crisp, its contents classified.

He didn’t even look up when I threw another folder onto his desk.

This one was mine.

“You had him killed.” My voice was even, controlled—but beneath it, something inside me was boiling.

Carter finally glanced at the folder. Flipped it open like he already knew what was inside.

The Wendigo Survivor Report.

A man—mid-forties, off-the-grid type—stumbled out of the Montana wilderness, frostbitten and starved but alive. He should’ve died. Hell, by all accounts, he did die. But something brought him back.

And the last thing he saw before escaping?

Me.

A Division cleanup team was sent in within hours. The official report said he died from “exposure-related complications.” The truth?

They put a bullet in his skull for seeing too much.

Carter sighed, rubbing his temple like I was a kid throwing a tantrum. “You should’ve left this alone.”

I clenched my fists. Felt my veins pulse. “He survived. That should’ve been enough.”

Carter finally looked at me. And for the first time, I realized he wasn’t just my handler.

He was my predecessor.

The first Revenant.

“You don’t get it, do you?” He leaned forward, voice calm. Patient. Like he was explaining something simple to a child. “We don’t leave loose ends. He saw something that shouldn’t exist. Something that could’ve unraveled everything we’ve worked for.”

I shook my head. “You mean me.”

Carter’s expression didn’t change. “You were never meant to be the hero, 18 C. You were meant to be a weapon. But weapons don’t ask questions. They don’t hesitate. They don’t come marching into their handler’s office demanding justice.”

I swallowed the bitter taste in my mouth. Hesitated.

Carter caught it. And for the first time, his mask slipped.

He smiled.

“That’s why you’re a liability.”

The room exploded into motion.

The air rippled around him as he lunged, and for a brief second, I saw what was beneath—his skin flickered, translucent, veins thick and pulsing with something black. His pupils dilated too wide, too deep, until they were nothing but voids swallowing the whites of his eyes. When he spoke, his voice echoed—not just one voice, but many.

The first bullet missed my head by an inch.

The second tore through my side.

Pain flared hot and sharp, but my body was already healing. Not fast enough. Not yet.

I hit the ground, rolled, grabbed the closest thing I could—a chair.

I threw it.

Not at Carter, but at the lights.

Glass shattered. The room plunged into flickering darkness. Shadows stretched and warped.

Carter laughed, stepping forward. “You think that’ll save you?”

I clenched my jaw. “No.”

“But it’ll slow you down.”

I lunged.

Carter met me in the middle. Fist to fist. Bone to bone.

I don’t know how long we fought. Seconds. Minutes. Forever. He was stronger. More experienced. But I was angrier.

And that made me reckless.

He drove an elbow into my ribs, cracking something. I staggered back, vision swimming.

“You don’t get it,” he said, breath steady. “You and I? We aren’t human anymore. We never were.”

I spit blood onto the floor. “Speak for yourself.”

Carter tilted his head. “Then why are you still healing, why are you stronger than everyone around you?”

I didn’t answer.

Because we both knew the truth.

I wasn’t normal. Not anymore.

And the longer I stayed here, the longer I let The Division pull the strings, the closer I came to becoming something else.
I needed to go. Now.

Carter saw the shift in my stance. “You can’t outrun this.”

I exhaled. “Watch me.”

Then I turned and ran.

The diner was quiet.

A shitty little roadside place, barely a blip on the map. The kind of spot where people didn’t ask questions.

I sat in the back booth, hoodie pulled low, blood seeping through my makeshift bandages.

But they weren’t healing right. The skin around them crawled, like something beneath the surface was knitting me back together too fast, too eagerly. The flesh looked fresh, but it wasn’t mine—it felt alien, tight and stretched like a poorly-fitted mask.

Across from me, the waitress was watching.

She was young—early twenties, auburn hair pulled into a messy bun, tired eyes that had seen too much. She hadn’t said much since she found me slumped against the booth, barely conscious.

Just patched me up. Poured me coffee.

Now, she studied me with quiet curiosity.

“You wanna tell me what happened to you?” she finally asked.

I wrapped my fingers around the mug, feeling the heat against my skin. “No.”

She smirked. “Figures.”

A pause.

Then—softer— “You running from something?”

I didn’t look up. “Yeah.”

She nodded, like she already knew the answer. “You got a plan?”

I exhaled slowly.

I had nothing.

No contacts. No allies. No idea what came next.

But I still had one advantage.

Carter thought I was just another rogue asset. A failed experiment running on borrowed time.

He didn’t know what I knew.

That whatever was inside me? It was still waking up.

And when it did?

I was going to burn The Division to the ground.

The waitress refilled my cup, watching me carefully. “Well,” she said, “if you need a place to lay low… you’re not the first guy to come through here looking like hell.”

I studied her. “Why help me?”

She shrugged. “You remind me of my brother.”

Something twisted in my chest.

I nodded. Took a slow sip of coffee.

For now, I’d lay low.

But soon?

I’d go back into the dark.

And this time, I wouldn’t be hunting for The Division.

I flexed my fingers against the coffee cup. For a second, the skin rippled. Shifted. Like it wasn’t quite settled into the right shape. I forced it back down, clenching my fist. Not yet. But soon.

I’d be hunting them.

Tim—


I don’t make peanut butter fudge anymore. I still have my iPhone 11 because I’m afraid of losing old voicemails. I can hold my breath in the shower, but I can’t do it without thinking of you. I listen to Romeo and Juliet by The Killers, and it wrecks me every time. It’s hard to be on a boat knowing you’re not there to be the captain.

I still hang Jax and Cohen’s ornaments on my little tree every year. I think of you whenever a sad love song comes on the radio. I still scroll through old Snapchat memories. I’ve tried to move on—then I tried again, and again—but it’s hard when you keep showing up in my dreams. And even when you don’t, I replay our memories, our conversations, the way things felt. Because no matter how much time passes, I still believe what we had was real.

I remember you once said you were surprised I turned out the way I did, given my upbringing. At the time, I didn’t realize how much pain and trauma lived in my shadows, how it leaked into our relationship in ways I wasn’t even aware of. I didn’t realize how much going on and off birth control would affect my mind and body. I didn’t realize how scary it would be, navigating a global pandemic, or how hard it was for me to communicate emotions I didn’t yet have the words for. I thought talking about feelings was easy—how life has humbled me.

But when I think back, I don’t dwell on any of the small, silly disagreements. I think about practicing paddleboarding in the pool, playing dinosaurs with Jax, talks with your Dad about God, steaks with Marina, falling asleep on your chest. I never realized how tired I always was, but looking back, I think it was because I felt safe. I felt at home in your arms.

You gave me so much perspective on life and how to live it. You made me braver and more courageous. And I’m channeling that courage now because honestly, this is hard. There’s a chance you’ve moved on. A chance you don’t feel the same. A chance I won’t know you when you’re 65 and fully gray. And if I could go back and teach my younger self everything I know now, I would. I wouldn’t have let go of someone so special—someone I wanted to be 65 and gray with.

But more than anything, what truly matters to me is that you’re happy. Even if that means it won’t be with me, as much as that pains me to say.

Getting older is hard. It’s even harder when you’ve been the only person I can picture it with.

“All I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat and bad company… When are we gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?”

The time was wrong, but the person was right.

I’ve always loved you for who you are. What you are. Everything you will be. You’ve always felt like a little piece of heaven on earth. You’re the first sip of coffee in the morning, a fresh Krispy Kreme donut, the rainbow after the rain.

And if we’re never meant to be again, I’ll try to find peace in that. But if nothing else, I just needed you to know.

Whoever ends up with you will be the luckiest girl in the world.

I'd finished the first draft back in 2022 after an arduous drafting process, battling depression and chronic unemployment such that I barely touched my manuscript for roughly three years after starting it in 2017. I completed that first draft with the elegance of a drunk pilot landing at LAX, but I finished nonetheless. 

I gave myself some space from it to better organize my personal life, and when I revisited it, I decided upon two things. First, that although the events at the beginning of my story were vital, they were, frankly, dull to read: melodramatic at best, tedious at worst. I would rework plot elements to give it more punch, which led me to the second decision. Due to the increased length this would cause, I split my manuscript in half, using this new plotline as the basis of book 1, while the back half of my original draft would serve as book 2. I would rewrite both.

Therein lay my reason for feeling daunted. Completing the first draft had taken years, and a rewrite for two books would likely take even longer. My task would be Sisyphean if I approached it the same way I had the first time around. I knew I had to take a different approach. 

I wound up asking a question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/120vg6f/rebuilding_my_stamina_as_a_writer/) about rebuilding my stamina as a writer, and I got similar advice across the board: small word counts are fine, but consistency is key.

Fast forward to the end of 2023. I impressed upon myself to spend more time writing each month in 2024 than not, and as long as I wrote more than half the days in a month, I would be content. Setting a minimum of 400 words seemed reasonable given my full-time job, as well as other commitments. 

I started slow, my goal originally to write every day of the work week while resting on weekends. After that, I wanted to successfully write every day for a full week. The goal of a one week streak became two, which became a month. I completed my first full month of writing in March 2024, at which point I decided to just keep my streak going for as long as I could. Around four months, I decided I would shoot for a full year of writing.

In September I finished my second draft of the first book. Right now, I'd say I'm about a third of the way done with the rewrite of book two. As stated in the title, I wound up with a total word count of 185,794 between March 1st, 2024 and March 1st, 2025. 

Other observations:

* Consistency does a whole lot more for progress than relying on inspiration. I think most authors here will tell you that perseverance does much more for the craft than raw skill, and even if what you're putting on paper isn't great, it can always be fixed in the editing stage. I think we have this romanticization of writing that often isn't conducive. Everyone is different, but rarely is it cafe mornings with a coffee and a Danish, watching the sunrise as you clack away at your keyboard. More often than not it's clawing for any shred of progress you can make that day, because work was a pain in the ass, dinner went undercooked, and dammit you just want to get some sleep. Besides, if you only ever wrote with the former example, you'd either wind up broke in short order due to inflation or simply write too rarely to make any considerable progress. Writing needs to be as much a habit as it is a passion.
* I read twelve books over the past year. They were primarily fantasy, which is my favorite genre and the genre the book I'm writing belongs to, but they were not the only ones. I noticed that, sometimes, my own prose would sometimes adopt subtleties shared by the author I was reading at that time, especially if I moved directly from reading to writing. Hardly anything that would be considered plagiaristic, but nonetheless a quirk I found fascinating.
* Although I primarily wrote at night, I noticed that on days where I had to write earlier in the day (often either due to exhaustion or prior arrangements in the evening) I tended to be more focused. I think it might have something to do with the necessity of finishing my words for the day with a hard deadline as opposed to a vague sense of anything before midnight. 

I'm hoping to accomplish two years in a row, hopefully even increasing my daily word count at some point if I feel like I can manage it with my schedule. I'm also aiming to finish editing my completed second draft this year, as I've been learning that the editing process is its own special hell. But I'm proud of myself, and I think that counts for something.",33,1740864891.0,writing,1,1.0,False

I have a lot of love for her. I think she’s a wonderful person—extremely ambitious and resourceful. But lately, I’ve started to realize that I might not actually *like* her.  Does that make any sense?  
She currently lives abroad, so we mostly text, and in that aspect, everything is great—I could write with her endlessly. But when we see each other (which usually means several-day visits), I can’t wait for her to leave. Somehow, she drains my energy, and I need time to recover from her presence afterward.  
She’s very loud and extroverted—the complete opposite of me. On top of that, I feel like our relationship comes with a set of rules that I have to follow. Sometimes, just pulling out my phone for a moment to reply to my partner or a friend (I’m great at multitasking and always let her know I’m still listening) turns into a full-on lecture. Mind you, we’re not just meeting for a quick coffee—we’re together 24/7 for several days. I don’t know if this is an important detail, but *it drives me crazy.*  
When I pointed out that she does the same thing and it doesn’t bother me, she simply responded, *“That’s not true, and even if it were, it would be a completely different situation.”* And honestly, that’s how 99% of discussions with her go. I don’t feel like pointing anything out to her anymore because I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not worth my energy. I’d rather just nod along.
My friends don’t really like her either, and my fiancé can’t stand her. He told me there’s no big reason—just listening to her exhausts him. I think I’ve been in denial about it, but I’m starting to see what he means.
Sometimes I’m dreaming about telling her that I want to take step out of this relationship. But she’s also autistic and I know how hard she struggles to create meaningful relationships. There were a lot of moments when she was simply crying to me about people leaving her. She simply loves other people but it’s really hard for her to connect. Truthfully, I understand why.

A Colonial Language Weaponized for Nationalism

The United States has officially declared English as its national language because nothing says true American heritage like a language built through centuries of colonization, forced assimilation, and cultural erasure.

The irony is that English is not even a pure language. It is a linguistic mix shaped by centuries of conquest, colonialism, and forced adoption. If lawmakers and nationalists truly wanted to enforce pure English, they would need to purge half the words they use daily, including economy, democracy, and law, because they are not actually English.

This is not about communication. It is about control. The U.S. is not declaring English as the national language to preserve it. It is doing so to weaponize it against non-English speakers, further marginalizing immigrants, Indigenous communities, and multilingual Americans under the guise of patriotism.

To understand how incoherent the idea of protecting English is, we need to break down the actual history of the English language.

The Etymology of English: A History of Theft

English, as it exists today, is not a single-origin language. It is a colonial hybrid shaped through invasion, empire, and cultural absorption. Declaring English as the official language of the U.S. is absurd, not only because it violates the linguistic rights of millions of people, but because English itself was never pure to begin with.

Old English (5th–11th Century): The Germanic Foundation

English did not originate in England. It began as a Germanic language brought to Britain by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes around 450 CE after the fall of the Roman Empire. Before this invasion, Britain was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples whose languages were displaced by the new Germanic dialects.

This early form of English was vastly different from what we know today. If you saw a passage of Old English, you would not recognize it.

The Vikings then invaded Britain in the 8th to 11th centuries, bringing Old Norse influence. Many everyday words in modern English, such as anger, husband, knife, law, ransack, and sky, come from Norse roots.

The Norman Invasion (1066 CE): The French Takeover

In 1066, William the Conqueror of Normandy, modern-day France, invaded England, bringing a massive linguistic shift. The Normans spoke Old French, which became the language of the ruling elite, while the lower classes continued speaking English.

Thousands of French words were absorbed into English, leading to the class divide we still see in English vocabulary today. This is why we have two words for the same thing, one from Old English and the other from French.

Cow (Old English) vs. Beef (French)
Pig (Old English) vs. Pork (French)
Sheep (Old English) vs. Mutton (French)
House (Old English) vs. Mansion (French)
Ask (Old English) vs. Request (French)

For centuries, the English language was shaped by forced assimilation, as lower-class English speakers had to adopt French-influenced vocabulary to advance socially.

The Renaissance and Latin Influence (14th–17th Century)

During the Renaissance, Latin and Greek became dominant sources of new vocabulary as scholars and religious institutions reshaped English. Many legal, scientific, and philosophical terms used today originate from Latin, not English.

Alibi, bonus, data, forum, justice, liberty, status quo, democracy, economy, chaos, planet, theory, and tyrant all came from Latin or Greek.

British Imperialism (17th–20th Century): The Global Expansion of English

English did not spread because of merit. It spread because of brute imperialism. As the British Empire expanded across the world, English was violently imposed on colonized peoples. English was not shared. It was forced.

During colonization, English absorbed words from other languages as the British Empire expanded its dominance. The very English words nationalists claim as uniquely American are actually borrowed from the languages of the people Britain oppressed.

Arabic: Alcohol, algebra, algorithm, coffee, zero, sofa
Hindi and Sanskrit: Jungle, shampoo, loot, bungalow
Chinese: Ketchup, gung-ho, typhoon
Indigenous languages of the Americas: Chocolate, tomato, canoe, hurricane, barbecue

So when the U.S. declares English as the official language, what exactly is it preserving? The language itself is a product of imperialism, conquest, and cultural theft.

The Absurdity of Linguistic Purity

If lawmakers were serious about keeping English pure, they would need to eliminate thousands of commonly used words that are not originally English. The language they claim to protect is already a multilingual mix, full of words taken from other languages through conquest and colonization.

Chef, genre, fiancé, résumé, restaurant, cliché, rendezvous, agenda, alibi, bonus, forum, veto, status quo, democracy, economy, dialogue, planet, chaos, phobia, theory, tyrant, kindergarten, wanderlust, pretzel, rucksack, doppelgänger, algebra, algorithm, coffee, zero, sofa, tomato, chocolate, canoe, barbecue, and hurricane are just a few examples.

So what now? Are we banning half the dictionary? Should Americans stop talking about the economy because it is a Greek word? Should politicians stop yelling about democracy because that is also Greek? Should we rename every legal and political document to strip out Latin?

Of course not. Because the goal of this policy is not to purify English. It is to weaponize it against non-English speakers.

Declaring English the Official Language is a First Amendment Violation

Beyond the historical irony, enforcing English as the official language is a direct violation of the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech and expression.

The Constitution does not declare English as the national language for a reason. The United States was founded as a multilingual society. Indigenous languages were spoken across the continent long before English even arrived. Spanish was spoken in what is now the U.S. before English settlers ever set foot here.

Making English the official language creates legal and social barriers for non-English speakers, restricting their ability to access government services, legal representation, and civic participation.

Restricting access to government documents, legal proceedings, and essential services in other languages directly disenfranchises non-English speakers.
Enforcing English as the standard in public affairs suppresses linguistic diversity and erases the rights of those who speak other languages.
The First Amendment protects an individual’s right to communicate in the language of their choosing. Declaring English the official language contradicts that fundamental right.

This is not about making communication easier. It is about using language as a weapon of exclusion, forcing assimilation under the guise of patriotism. By enforcing English as the national language, the U.S. is effectively saying, your native language is not valid in civic engagement, public discourse, or government affairs.

The real intent of this policy is not to unite the country. It is to create legal disadvantages for non-English speakers and reinforce nationalist ideology. This is linguistic discrimination, plain and simple.

I’ve been using my 1Zpresso K-Plus for a while, and recently, I’ve noticed that it’s taking twice as long to grind the same amount of coffee compared to before.

For example:
	•	Previously, grinding 20g of coffee for filter at 80 clicks took 20-25 seconds.
	•	Now, the same settings and beans take 45 seconds or more!

I haven’t changed my grind setting, and I’m using the same type of beans.

What I’ve Been Doing:
	•	I regularly clean the grinder using a brush and an air blower to remove fines and coffee dust.
	•	The grinding effort feels harder, like there’s more resistance.
	•	I haven’t done a full disassembly deep clean in a while.
	•	The burrs look fine, but I haven’t checked for wear or misalignment.

I suspect it could be due to buildup of fines in hard-to-reach areas, burr wear, or misalignment, but I’m not sure.

Has anyone else experienced this issue? Would a deep clean help, or do I need to replace the burrs? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",2,1740864788.0,1zpresso,2,1.0,False

**Locations:** Highlands (Ngorongoro Crater) (2 nights), Olakira (Ndutu - just outside of the Southern Serengeti) (3 nights), Dunia (Central Serengeti) (2 nights) and Namiri Plains (Eastern Seregenti) (3 nights). We also spent a night in Arusha (Arusha Coffee Lodge) on our first night and stayed at one of the hotels near the airport (Airport Planet Lodge) on our last night.

**When we went**: February 2025

**Who went**: Couple

**General Information:** We did a drive-in, fly-out safari and visited the properties in the order I listed them under ""Locations.""

**Cost:** Overall cost was around 15,000 per person. This includes the two nights at the beginning and end (and meals at those hotels other than dinner at the airport hotel), our domestic flight out of the Serengeti, ground transportation, a driver for a half day on our day in Arusha, all park fees and other government levies, all meals, snacks and drinks while on safari and unlimited game drives.

**Service**: 9.5/10

The service was really great. All of the staff did an excellent job of remembering preferences.  When you walked into a common area, it would be seconds before someone offered you a drink. Everyone was very friendly and willing to chat, but service was also not overbearing and you could have moments alone to just enjoy.   Very fast response on radio if you needed a drink brought to your tent, someone to walk you to dinner, etc.  The service at Namiri was really, really especially excellent thanks to our server/butler who was a more senior employee (and soon to ""move up"" from the position). For example, on our first night, without even really saying anything explicitly, he picked up on the fact that we liked the local/Swahili food and we then had a special Swahili dish every meal going forward.  However, it was still great everywhere and definitely generally consistent across the four camps. It felt the tiniest bit less refined at Dunia, but we also spent less time around the staff there due to our game drive schedule, so it is hard for me to really say that it wasn't just as good.

The only snafu was scheduling us for sundowners in the bush on our last night when we told the camp manager we did not want them/wanted to have as much time on our game drive.

**Property**: 

Highlands (9/10): Highlands is located about 45 minutes from the crater rim, which is why I gave it a 9/10. We of course knew this going in and actually really loved the more remote location and the highlands are BEAUTIFUL, but I suppose it is still technically not as good of a location as the properties on the rim overall. The communal spaces (consisting of a bar tent, the large lounge tent that is in my picture and a dining tent) were really gorgeous with fireplaces (it was as low as about 50F/10C in the evenings during our visit) and sweeping views.  One note - it is somewhere in the ballpark of 2700M/8,800F above sea level. I live basically at sea level and while it didn't affect me too much, I did feel a bit ""off"" when I was walking around, especially at first. Some of the tents are a pretty good distance from the common areas, walking uphill, and some older folks had to be moved so that may be something to request if you think it will be an issue.

Olakira (10/10): In the middle of the migration, so you can't beat the location! Nice, large communal tent/bar tent and then meals were served outside in the lawn area.

Dunia (10/10): In the Central Serengeti, but away from the madness so best of both worlds.  Really large communal area with a bar, many seating options and meals served on the deck.

Namiri (10/10): In an amazing remote location of the Eastern Serengeti - the closest property is like an hour away and we saw I think one vehicle from somewhere other than our camp. There is a lovely pool with nice, comfortable lounge chairs and hammocks, a cool ""library"" area where you can borrow books and look at, e.g., animal skulls, rocks, etc., and then the communal and bar area, where meals were served.  There was lots of space to spread out and it could feel private even when all or most of the guests were there.  Some of the tents are also a good distance from the common areas here but they have golf carts (we took one once when buffalo were right outside!).

**Rooms**: 

Highlands (10/10): We got the honeymoon ""tent,"" which had the private hot tub (I think it is mostly the same as the other tents otherwise - maybe a bit bigger with a better deck/view and more private). The ""tent"" is a dome with basically a 180 view of Highlands, a fire place and nice seating area. Very spacious shower that felt spa-like.

Olakira (10/10): Stayed in the standard tent. Even though it is a mobile tent, it felt pretty solid and permanent. Features a ""stargazing"" area/patio that is just netting (kind of like a screened-in porch).  You can sleep out there, but I was too scared. Especially for a mobile camp, I thought the bathroom was spacious and laid out well.

Dunia (10/10): Stayed in the standard tent. Similar to Olakira but felt a bit more permanent. The front, rather than being canvas, is like a screen door.  Very nice front patio area with a daybed.

Namiri (10/10):  Stayed in the standard ""tent"".   Very permanent with gorgeous rock walls.  Very large with a mini bar and multiple seating areas. Really large outdoor space with multiple seating areas and the bathtub.  Had a yoga mat with some equipment like resistance bands. Nice bath salts for the outdoor tub as well.  Had a coffee station, which we did not have at the other camps (although they would bring it to you either at a set time or on demand via radio).

The beds were all similar and pretty comfortable. Not the best I have ever had, but that doesn't bother me too much on safari. I think some (all?) were two beds pushed together, into one  but we didn't feel the ""gap"" as much as we did on our last safari that had the same setup. The tents at each camp had plenty of lighting, strong fans for cooling (other than Highlands where it wasn't necessary), nice shampoo/conditioner/wash, strong flashlights available for you, safes, robes and slippers (pretty comfy) and at each, really good and strong hot water heated via solar. Always lots of drinking water available. Housekeeping was great and our rooms always felt fresh.

**Food**: 

Food was great and a mix of local dishes, some Indian dishes and more Western style dishes (I had one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had one day at lunch).

For breakfast, at each camp, you could order eggs and sausage/bacon and then they would have other, continental breakfast type options that could come out on a little sample platter or be served al la carte. We aren't big breakfast eaters on safari so in a lot of instances we just got like, one egg, but everything we did have was good.

The box lunches we did not order or get choices for, although I am sure if you requested something, that could absolutely be accommodated. This would typically be something like a wrap, some fruit, a small brownie and some nuts. The hot lunches would usually consist of some sort of main protein (such as grilled fish) with vegetable sides and some sort of starch/carb (like a really nice pesto pasta salad one day) and then a small serving of sorbet for dessert.  We weren't explicitly offered different choices in most instances, but I heard other guests making requests for different things with no issues. Dinner would have a soup or salad (such as green banana soup or a halloumi salad), sometimes another small appetizer in addition to or in lieu of the salad/soup (like a samosa), options for the main - multiple protein choices - and would usually come with multiple sides and veggies (for example, stuff like grilled veggies, creamed spinach, local style sides that mix veggies with beans, delicious local style okra) and then a couple choices of dessert. It was set up a bit differently at each camp and each night.  It was all really good and all felt really fresh with lots of opportunities for getting vegetables in.  It is kind of hard to rate because even though they seemed REALLY flexible about accommodating different choices and dietary preferences/allergies (we have none ourselves), it is not like there is a true menu like there ""normally"" would be, and while I genuinely veryyyyyy, very much enjoyed each and every meal (despite being a bit of a food snob at times), its not like its a foodie focused vacation..I guess the best way to say it is that this is my third safari and it was my favorite food so far - so I'd say 10/10, but its just a different food situation than other trips.

We really enjoyed the wine, all South African - with more options at Namiri than the other camps (I will say we are not big wine snobs).  Full bar selection. It seemed like the bartenders were knowledgeable about all the standard drinks and had their own signature drinks as well that we really enjoyed.

AMAZING fresh juice was available along the other standard non-alcoholic offerings. The coffee was always fabulous.

**The Actual Safari**: 1000000/10

We used an Asilia guide, who was amazing. He really understood our preferences quickly on (that we'd really rather just drive and enjoy birds and the scenery than go to crowded sightings), had a wealth of knowledge, was great at spotting and was friendly and great to be around. We saw all of the Big Five, a few more rare animals (honey badgers!!!) and got to see multiple hunts (some failed, some successful).",1,1740864318.0,FATSafari,1,1.0,False

1j1a6od,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1j1a6od/sf_quitter/,[SF] Quitter,"Frank Rivers took a drag of his cigarette. His last cigarette.

He felt blessed to have come to this place, but the smoking habit now made him very self-conscious. 

People born in Unitopia did not smoke. They had quashed the habit as a collective using intensive drug, therapy, and eugenics programs.

They had given him several packs when they saved him from captivity, and gave him a pack more every month for the last three years. 

For a society of non-smokers, they certainly had a lot of tobacco, and a lot of knowledge about the stuff. 

Frank was born in Freetopia, where tobacco use was so pervasive, Unitopians actually think it’s compulsory there. Frank was pretty sure no one ever forced him. 

As a child soldier in Freetopia, some of Frank’s fondest memories were associated with tobacco.

He was traumatized by his earlier life, but to him, smoking was what he did when he wasn’t being forced to commit atrocities. Smoking was the one repeated activity that didn’t involve the participation in or witnessing of any war crimes. 

So Frank associated it with the calmer, if not wholly pleasant, memories from his childhood.

He’d been in Unitopia for three years. He’d tapered off his habit out of pure convenience. You weren’t \*allowed\* to smoke anywhere in this place. 

He had been given a standard dose of Unitopia’s powerful cessation drug, Biogen Compound T, or brand name “Quit”. He hadn’t taken it yet.

He had cut down from 2 packs per day to 2 cigarettes per day, but he couldn’t keep himself to just 1 per day. 

The native Unitopians urged him to quit, and gave him a dozen and a half reasons to, but they still had tobacco for him. Their research showed that removing it from him would only backfire.

He looked at the white tablet on his coffee table. Tonight was the night.

The way The Quit Pill worked, Frank had been told, was through a one time “readjustment” of body chemistry. 

He was assured that the days or weeks of discomfort and sickness associated with quitting cold turkey were circumvented through this process. 

he was instructed to take the pill in the late morning and then relax, and stay in his dormitory room until the next day. 

He popped the pill in his mouth and took a sip of his water bottle. 

\---

They told him he could get a little dizzy. They told him he could have some strange dreams. 

What the Unitopian natives did not tell Frank, is that this dizziness was not \*little,\* but massive\*.\* What they did not tell him is that he would be wide awake for these “strange dreams”.

Two hours after taking the pill, his sense of balance was incredibly off. As it intensified, he hurried to the bathroom. In his head he was going to try to take a piss before he was too dizzy to stand. 

It was a good instinct because he got to the toilet just in time to vomit up his entire stomach. 

It could have been 15 minutes of retching. It could have been 3 hours. He had no perspective on time. 

He felt less nauseous, and there was certainly nothing left for him to throw up.

He stood, shaky at first. The dizziness had lessened, but was still present. He looked in the mirror. For a moment he saw his face morph, grow younger. He shook his head violently. The dizziness! He retched again. Just bile, he spit it in the sink. 

He wanted to lie down. He opened the bathroom door but his bedroom was gone. The bathroom looked normal, but it opened up to the outside. And it wasn’t Unitopia by the looks of it. It was Freetopia. Out in the desert.

He closed the bathroom door and it stood there alone in the middle of a dirt road. Nothing on the opposite side. He opened it, and like a portal, his bathroom was on the other side now. Still just a flat door if he walked around it. He tried going back inside the bathroom and closing the door and reopening. Still a portal.

He had no clue how any of this was possible. Frank had tried hallucinogens as a teenager but this was very different. He felt very lucid, and tried to work out how he could \*actually\* be in his dorm, but able to explore this outdoor environment in such detail. 

He wandered around in the general vicinity of the bathroom door for what seemed like hours. He eventually recognized the locale. He was not five kilometers from where he was born, the outskirts of the city of Freemark. 

He saw a young boy and an older man walking towards him. It was too late to hide they were too close. He waved at them as they walked. They did not see him. They continued walking as he shouted and pantomimed, which he soon realized was useless. 

As they got closer, he recognized them. It was him as a child, and his former drill sergeant, Randal Murtry. They walked right past Frank and the door, taking no notice. The younger Frank was six or seven years old. This was the day he smoked his first cigarette.

It was right here on this dirt road. The instant he saw his younger self light up, Frank collapsed to the ground unconscious.

\---

Frank Rivers was wide awake. He had to be. The rebels were advancing. He was 17 again. He had a vague memory of being 25 and living in Unitopia, but that must have been a hallucination from all the stimulants they took when they performed these six day assault marches in the arid heat of the Freetopian steppe. 

He was the forward action attendant for Commander Michelle Stockton. The rest of the squad was already dead. His job was to make sure that if Michelle died, whoever did it had to kill him first. 

As the mortar fire went off at semi-regular intervals Frank secured their small sniper’s nest. Michelle returned to their defensive position. “We’re clear.” She said, taking two cigarettes from her helmet pocket. She offered him one.

The dream of his life in Unitopia was over. He was here in this war, and he had to protect the commander. A cigarette break meant they were safe. A cigarette break meant the coast was clear. 

As they lit up, she smiled flirtatiously at him. Stockton was 10 years his senior, but it was an open secret that the only reason she wasn’t already an admiral was her long record of sexual harassment of her subordinates. Frank’s adolescent mind had a hard time seeing it as harassment. He found her incredibly attractive. He wanted to be the next person she harassed.

In the old days, she would have already been kicked out of the armed forces, but Freetopia was no longer in the habit of letting good soldiers go to waste just because of some ethics violations. 

“How old are you private Rivers?” She asked.

“Seventeen, ma’am” he replied, smiling. 

“You got a girlfriend back in Freemark?” She asked, flicking her cigarette.

“No ma’am” he replied, attempting for an ironically formal tone. 

“Listen private, it’s just you and me now.” she said. It was still an intimate tone but all levity was gone. “Call me Michelle, Frank.” She put her hand on his arm and drew him close. 

The mortar fire had moved closer to them. The newest high pitched falling noise sounded louder than any of the rest all day. Frank looked up, cigarette in his mouth. 

In an instant, their general surroundings changed drastically. The blast must have gone off within 15 meters of their fortified position.

Their fortified position was gone. Both Frank and Michelle had been put on the ground by the blast. Frank looked up and saw the bottom layer of sandbags, and a few of the branches he had used for the roof. The fort they had worked most of last night building was now just a pile of ash. 

He looked to Michelle. She was back at her feet before him. He stood. She was Commander Stockton now. 

“Get the packs, let’s move.” She commanded.

Frank grabbed their gear and began running south, Commander Stockton leading him with her assault rifle.

They heard the hissing sound of mortar fire again as Commander Stockton turned around. She was maybe twenty meters ahead, taking cover by a bush.

This shell hit not 2 meters from her. Frank was blown back again, he felt shrapnel hit him in the thigh.

The pain was searing. He couldn’t stand. He took out a cigarette. If he was going to die, he’d die with a cigarette in his mouth. It was so hot out. He closed his eyes.

\---

Frank awoke freezing cold. He was on the floor of his dormitory in Unitopia. The AC left the place a chilly 16 degrees Celsius. He was wet too. His face, shoulders, and torso were covered in what he could only guess was stomach bile and sweat. It smelled disgusting. It smelled like tobacco. 

He stood up, and was met with an incredible wave of dizziness, which subsided quickly enough for him to actually catch himself before falling back down to the floor.

He looked at his clock. He had only taken The Quit Pill 2 hours ago. Why did they tel him to stay in his dorm the entire night?

He went to the bathroom, leaving the door open this time and splashed his face with water. He took a shower.

As he was drying off, he didn’t speak, but he thought to himself:

“What a strange trip. Thank god it’s over”

“Over? Are you kidding?” Frank recognized Randal Murtry’s voice coming from the bedroom.

He went back out and standing there was sergeant Randal Murtry, and Commander Michelle Stockton. Frank knew they were both dead, but here they were, in the flesh.

“Kid, we’re just getting started” Stockton said, with a flirtatious wink.",1,1740864284.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I have a question about the rules as we played a bit differently than what is specified in rules in the box. 

Are you allowed to put multiple answers per question? The way I was taught was yes, so that if you say a word that someone else says (and gets cancelled out) you have your next word to get a point from (if nobody else has it), but it doesn’t specify if you can/cant in the rules. 

I know you can put multiple words for extra points (e.g. type of dish, letter c, coffee cup), but what i’m wondering is if it is correct to for example put coffee cup AND colander (for the chance that your first one gets cancelled out), or if you have to pick one or the other?

**What Do Guests Expect from Short-Term Rentals in 2025?**

The short-term rental landscape is evolving rapidly, and with 2025 around the corner, guest expectations have never been higher. Travelers are no longer just looking for a place to stay; they are seeking seamless experiences, high-end comfort, and a level of service that rivals luxury hotels. At [*Llivo*](https://www.llivo.com/), we understand that meeting and exceeding these expectations is key to maintaining high occupancy rates and securing five-star reviews.

Understanding what today’s travelers want can help you stand out in an increasingly competitive market.

# Personalized Experiences Matter More Than Ever

A personalized experience is now a non-negotiable factor for many guests. The one-size-fits-all approach no longer works. Instead, travelers expect accommodations that cater to their specific needs, whether it’s business travelers looking for high-speed Wi-Fi and a quiet workspace, or families seeking child-friendly amenities and safety features. Hosts who go the extra mile by offering tailored recommendations, curated local experiences, and personalized touches such as welcome baskets or handwritten notes will see higher satisfaction rates.

# Technology is Now an Expectation, Not a Luxury

Technology is also playing a more prominent role in guest expectations. Contactless check-ins, smart home features, and AI-powered concierge services are no longer futuristic ideas but expected conveniences. Guests want to control lighting, temperature, and entertainment systems through their smartphones or voice commands. Properties equipped with these features not only enhance comfort but also provide an added layer of security, making guests feel more at ease. Short-term rentals that integrate smart technology will have a clear competitive edge.

# Cleanliness and Hygiene Can Make or Break a Stay

Cleanliness and hygiene have always been crucial, but now they are make-or-break factors. Guests are highly aware of cleanliness standards, expecting hotel-level sanitation in vacation rentals. Regular deep cleaning, sanitized high-touch surfaces, and well-maintained properties are essential. Providing clear communication about your cleaning practices can also reassure guests and make them feel safe. *A spotless home is the first step to securing repeat bookings and positive reviews.*

# Seamless Communication is a Must-Have

Seamless communication is another aspect that can define a guest’s experience. Instant responses, clear instructions, and proactive engagement before, during, and after their stay can make all the difference. Guests appreciate quick replies to their inquiries, well-documented check-in instructions, and a host who is readily available to handle any issues that arise. Short-term rental hosts who invest in automated messaging systems while maintaining a personal touch will create an effortless guest experience. *Good communication is no longer just a bonus—it’s an expectation.*

# Sustainability is Becoming a Key Decision Factor

Sustainability is becoming an integral part of travel decisions. Eco-conscious guests prefer rentals that prioritize sustainability, from energy-efficient appliances to waste reduction strategies. Many travelers are actively choosing properties that align with their environmental values, meaning hosts who provide eco-friendly amenities, such as reusable toiletries and water-saving fixtures, are more likely to attract bookings. *Properties that embrace green living* will appeal to the growing market of eco-conscious travelers.

# Transparent Pricing Builds Trust and Loyalty

Transparency and fair pricing continue to be at the forefront of guest priorities. With increasing competition in the short-term rental market, travelers are carefully assessing costs and value. Hidden fees or unexpected charges can lead to negative reviews, discouraging future bookings. Guests appreciate clarity on pricing, cancellation policies, and additional charges before they book. Offering competitive rates while delivering exceptional value ensures that guests leave feeling they received more than what they paid for. *Honest pricing builds trust and long-term guest loyalty.*

# Amenities Define Guest Satisfaction

Amenities can make or break a guest’s decision to book. High-speed internet, fully equipped kitchens, premium bedding, and entertainment options are no longer just perks—they are expectations. Business travelers need fast and reliable Wi-Fi, while families appreciate well-stocked kitchens and laundry facilities. Providing small luxuries such as complimentary coffee, streaming services, and comfortable furniture enhances the overall experience. Hosts who pay attention to detail will find that guests recognize and reward these efforts with positive reviews and repeat bookings. A rental with thoughtful amenities creates a home away from home.

# Cultural and Local Experiences Enhance Guest Stays

Cultural and local experiences are a growing demand in the short-term rental market. Guests are no longer satisfied with generic tourist experiences. They want authentic cultural interactions, insider recommendations, and immersive stays. Whether it’s a curated list of local restaurants, partnerships with nearby tour guides, or unique decor that reflects the region’s culture, incorporating local elements into a rental makes the stay more memorable. *Guests are looking for a connection to the destination, not just a place to sleep.*

# Security is a Growing Concern for Travelers

Security is another concern for modern travelers. With more people opting for short-term rentals over hotels, safety measures have become paramount. Secure locks, surveillance systems in public areas (while respecting privacy), and emergency contact details can put guests at ease. Travelers are increasingly selecting rentals that offer robust security features, particularly in unfamiliar locations. *Feeling safe is just as important as feeling comfortable.*

# Meeting Guest Expectations in 2025 is the New Standard

Looking ahead to 2025, the *short-term rental market is shifting towards guest-centric hospitality, advanced technology, and sustainable travel practices.* Meeting these expectations isn’t just about keeping up with trends; it’s about creating an unforgettable experience that keeps guests coming back. At [*Llivo*](https://www.llivo.com/p/boost-listing), we help hosts elevate their listings by embracing modern hospitality trends and guest expectations. By focusing on personalization, seamless technology, eco-conscious practices, and outstanding service, you can turn every stay into a five-star experience. *The future of short-term rentals* belongs to hosts who understand that exceeding expectations is the new standard.

# Comparison of Guest Expectations: Then vs. Now

Over the past decade, guest expectations in the hospitality industry have evolved significantly. In 2015, travelers were satisfied with basic cleanliness and comfort, but by 2025, they expect hotel-level cleanliness and strict sanitation standards. While a simple key handoff or manual check-in once sufficed, modern guests prefer smart locks and contactless check-ins for convenience and security. Wi-Fi was once considered a bonus, but now, high-speed internet is a necessity for both work and entertainment. Instead of relying on generic tourist recommendations, guests now seek personalized local experiences tailored to their interests. Standard security locks have been replaced with enhanced security measures and cameras, ensuring greater peace of mind. Pricing expectations have also shifted, moving from random pricing structures to transparent and dynamic pricing models. Lastly, while guests once accepted minimal amenities, they now demand fully stocked kitchens and high-end bedding for a more comfortable stay. These changes reflect the growing demand for a more seamless, personalized, and high-quality guest experience in the modern travel industry.

1j19wnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/loanoriginators/comments/1j19wnv/some_tips_for_mortgage_loan_bankers_re_getting/,Some tips for mortgage loan bankers re getting real estate agent recommendations,"This is a response to a discussion in another thread about what the proper etiquette is for soliciting clients in working with real estate agents. I've been in RE sales for over 35 years, so I will offer some practical recommendations.

If you want a shot at agents recommending you to clients the very best thing you can do is wangle an invite to a weekly sales meeting and bring some decent coffee, donuts, and pastries. Keep your presentation to 15 minutes maximum unless they want to extend it with questions for you. They are tolerating you timewise and want to get to their desks and start working.  Keep introductions short. Don't have some endless PowerPoint rodeo about your bank and your team, it's boring and no one cares. Keep it short, engage them directly. Ask them what they need from a mortgage banker. Have a conversation. If you cannot have this conversation and do some back-and-forth crowd work, you do not belong in mortgage banking.  

Understand before you speak to the group that the agents do not care about you, your personality, or your good looks. They don't care how big and wonderful your bank is, or how great your team is. They care about only one thing. If they turn a client over to you for qualification or pre-qualification are you going to be competent and efficient in making the deal happen or will there be a series of delays, dropped balls, processing screwups, and radio silence? The most successful mortgage lenders communicate like crazy, follow up quickly, and take care of business on their end of the deal. If there is bad news, confront it directly and rip the bandaid off. Time is the enemy of real estate deals. Don't delay in communicating. 

Beyond all this, be clear with the agents, so they can be clear with their clients about what your bank's up-to-date loan parameters are re downpayment, income, etc. so they can communicate this to their prospects and set expectations. All agents have to sell is their time. Experienced agents aren't idiots, they get it. They want to understand quickly if a buyer cannot be qualified. They don't want to waste their time or their client's time chasing unmakeable deals.

Agents are always hungry and new agents are often in the mix. Offer to have a ""lunch and learn"" in their office (you bring the sandwiches, chips, and bottled water) where you walk them through your approval process. Let them understand from your perspective what you need so they can communicate this to their clients. 

If you get a few referrals and you make the deals happen you will be a hero. The floodgates will open and you will be at the top of the recommended brokers list, but don't get complacent. One or two processing screwups and you are off the list. Agents have to rely on a relatively limited number of closed deals per year to make their livelihoods. They cannot afford ""oopses"".

My son is really mean. He’s been suspended multiple times for just straight up vicious behavior. Kicking kids, throwing rocks at kids, stealing their things and breaking it, calling kids names like “fatty” and “stupid”. He is really rude and disrespectful to me and his dad as well. He hits us, throws things, tells us we’re bad parents. 

I’ll go through our Saturday so far. He woke me up by shaking me, telling me to get up and make him breakfast. After breakfast I was sitting on the couch drinking some coffee and he was watching a YouTube tutorial of how to make a paper airplane. He couldn’t get it and was getting frustrated so he threw the iPad across the room. Later on, my 4 yr old asked to go to the park. Sure. Let’s get out some energy and get fresh air. Well, they needed lunch so I swung by Chick Fil A and we brought it to the park and had a picnic. It was fine and he ate it, then as we got to the playground, I was pushing my 4 yr old on the swings and my 6 yr old bounced off to the bigger part of the park. I guess he saw something he wanted from another kid and he took it from them and climbed up to the top of the slide. The kid came over to me along with his mom explaining my son took his cape. This child had Down syndrome and was clearly severely disabled. Yeah, my son stole a disabled kid’s cape he was wearing. I went over to get my son off the slide and he sat up at the top and said “no, it’s mine now, he was too slow.” He refused to come down. I was so embarrassed. I had to climb up there and physically wrestle it from him. 

After that we just left. But I needed to stop by the store to get something for dinner. My son started screeching for cookies. I was like, that’s not in the budget right now, plus we have some icecream at home. Didn’t matter, he ran off and threw a jar of pickled onions on the ground. Shattered everywhere. 

Once we got home I was pretty done. Of course I was reprimanding and discussing how disappointed in him I was, and he told me “I don’t care. Shut up!” Then he waltzed in the living room and demanded I turn on the TV for him. I was like no, absolutely not, you can go in your room and play. At that, he took the remote and tossed it at my head. 

I’m so beyond exhausted with him. We don’t know what to do. At school, he just hurts other kids. Doesn’t listen. Isn’t really learning anything. It just feels miserable, he’s so mean and unpleasant. He had a day where he got Chick Fil A, and the playground, and he was still just so damn mean. Why? Why is he like this? What do I do? I’m scared it’s going to get worse and worse.

The best by date is 1/12/2025. The MRE was stored either in a cool dark closet indoors and for about a year in a barn. The flameless ration heater worked as intended. 

I genuinely enjoyed the entree. It was flavorful and meaty. The rice, corn, and beans were all al dente; not mushy. For my taste, it benefited from adding the red chili flakes and could use a little salt, both of which are included in the accessory packet. I felt the quality was on par with Progresso or Hormel canned chili or gumbo. The tortillas were soft, if a little sweet. They went well with the entree. 

The shortbread cookie was crumbly, chalky, and the vanilla flavor was artificial and chemically. Not great. My least favorite component of the meal. Dipping the cookie in coffee helped. 

The coffee wasn’t great either, but had a nutty flavor that grew on me. If I needed a pick-me-up, I would definitely drink it. I only tried the lemonade beverage. It tasted just like you’d expect: lemon lime Gatorade powder.

The dried fruit mix was also fine, but could use some salted nuts to balance the sweetness from the pineapple and papaya. I particularly liked the crunchy banana pieces.

On the whole, I really liked the entree but I don’t think it overcomes the shortcomings of the sides. I think more savory flavors and less sweet would be better. Looking forward to trying other menus. I hope you found this review helpful.",2,1740863232.0,MRE,0,1.0,False

1j19ngz,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1j19ngz/why_dont_subjects_pick_the_right_production_method/,Why don't subjects pick the right Production Method?,"Hi everyone! I'm currently playing as Belgium, and got a nice swarm of over 20 protectorates and puppets around the world. They are all inside my market, and have ports to actually access it. But they have low MAPI, as the base is 75% and all of them are also traditionalist so get -15% for a total of just 60%. Some are over their infrastructure limit even though their buildings are not even 50% staffed, lowering MAPI further, and some are doing so bad that they went bankrupt for another -10% MAPI.

Many are suffering famines, because their farms have been set to the Fig Orchards PM instead of the Single Crop one, while the Fruit and Sugar these Fig Farms produce are not in demand (prices like < -25% for fruit and up to -75% for Sugar). Local grain prices are high (> +20% all the way up to > +40%). Hovering over the Single Crop PM of their farms tells me that it would make them more money to switch - often significantly - and it would also deal with the starvation. Some of my subject nations *do* have the Single Crop PM for their farms and are doing fine food wise, no starvation and decent prices. I've tried to export the sugar and fruit, but low MAPI makes it so that their low prices barely affect the price within the whole market.

And then there are nations that have no food production at all. None. Just coffee plantations (Lahej) or tobacco plantations (Sulu). I subjected them really early in the game, but it happens to non-subjects as well; I can find nations everywhere with starvation and way too few food producing buildings, or none at all. Lahej and Sulu can import grain from the wider market, but low MAPI makes it still very expensive. 

Has the AI never got the memo that starvation is now a thing? Or profit? Why don't these Subjects switch PM, or build other food buildings like wharves or ranches? Can I make them switch somehow? Are there mods that fix this? I mean I can construct buildings for them, but on the wrong PM it doesn't help. ",2,1740862839.0,victoria3,2,1.0,False

1j19hr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_nelsontalk/comments/1j19hr5/struggling_to_get_clicks_fix_this_first/,Struggling to Get Clicks? Fix This First!,"Hey folks,

Ever feel like you're shouting into the void? You put out content, but nobody clicks, nobody buys. It’s frustrating, right?

**Here’s the truth:** Most beginners focus on what they want to sell instead of why people buy.

Big mistake.

If you understand consumer buying behavior, your content will do the selling for you.

Let’s break it down:

# 1. People Buy Based on Emotion, Justify with Logic

Your content should **trigger an emotional response**. Don’t just list product features—tell a story. Example: Instead of saying, T*his tool automates your emails, try “Imagine waking up to affiliate commissions while you sip your morning coffee—without lifting a finger.”*

# 2. The 3 Types of Buyers (Know Your Audience!)

* **Impulse Buyers** – Need urgency. Use scarcity and FOMO (e.g., “Only 3 spots left!”).
* **Analytical Buyers** – Need data. Provide comparisons, reviews, and case studies.
* **Practical Buyers** – Need trust. Show testimonials, success stories, and risk-free guarantees.

# 3. Content That Matches the Buying Journey

* **Awareness Stage (People don’t even know they need your product yet)** → Create “How-to” guides, social media posts, and blog articles.
* Consideration Stage (They’re exploring options) → Share product comparisons, case studies, and pros & cons lists.
* **Decision Stage (They’re ready to buy)** → Use product reviews, bonuses, and limited-time offers to close the sale.

# 4. Speak Their Language (Ditch the Jargon!)

Beginners often overcomplicate things. If your audience is new to affiliate marketing, keep it simple. Use real-life examples and talk to them like a friend—not a professor

# 5. SEO? Yes, But Don’t Obsess

Sure, keywords matter, but Google loves engaging content. Instead of stuffing keywords, focus on solving real problems for your readers.

# Final Thought

Your audience doesn’t care about your product. They care about what your product can do for them. When you align your content with how people actually make buying decisions, you’ll see more clicks, more sales, and more success.",2,1740862397.0,u_nelsontalk,0,1.0,False
1j19hmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j19hmq/mostly_vent_maybe_some_advice/,"Mostly Vent, Maybe Some Advice?","A little background: gay dating (2 dudes, ages 33 and 35), we matched on Hinge - not sure if either matter...

We matched on Tuesday (Feb. 25), and started chatting right away, and immediately hit it off (this sentiment was expressed on both sides). 

Initially we had set up a date for tomorrow (Sunday), but we were talking Wednesday night and he asked if I wanted to meet for coffee the next day (2/27), of course I said yes. 

This is where it gets weird/confusing...

We were at the coffee shop for about an hour. From what I can tell, it was going well. The conversation started immediately and it seemed like we were both having a good time - we were smiling, laughing, sort of gazing into each other's eyes at times. He then said he had to go because he had do somd work (he has a very demanding job, and I was aware that he had plans later that evening with friends so even though it seemed somewhat abrupt, it also made sense). 

We walk out of the café together. He gives me a hug and says ""we will definitely see each other again."" Those were his exact words. 

I haven't heard from him since. 

I haven't been blowing him up! I've had that tendency in the past, but kept control this time because I really liked him, lol. I sent one message when I got home thanking him for inviting me and saying I'm excited to see him again (because he said we *definitely* would). No response. 

The next day (yesterday), I simply say I hope he had a good day. No response. 

This morning, I ask if everything is OK and say I'm starting to get a little worried. So far, no response. 

Here's why I'm here and not just moving on:
Of course I've been on dates where I thought it went well, and it turned out the other party wasn't interested, but there are 2 things that are confusing me right now:

First, him saying ""we will definitely see each other again."" I don't recall anyone ever saying that to me at the end of a first date, even when we did see each other again. I'm also hung up right now on *definitely* - he didn't just say ""we'll see each other again,"" but ""we'll *definitely* see each other again."" Am I reading too much into that? Also, the hug. Sure, maybe he was just being nice but leaving without a hug or even giving a handshake would be really easy ways to indicate there's no interest, and he did initiate the hugging, not me!

Second, while he hasn't responded, he also hasn't unmatched/blocked me on Hinge (we did not exchange numbers yet). 

I have had guys in the past kind of make it seem like there might be a second date, but then I get home and they either tell me otherwise, or they just straight up block me on the app. Neither has happened in this case. 

My little vent is, why do people do this?! We talked about how we both like open, honest, and direct communication. Say what you mean, mean what you say. Why tell someone you will *definitely* see them again when you know it's a lie?! I haven't dated in years because it's exhausting. I really liked this guy and I genuinely thought he was different. 

I guess where I wouldn't mind some feedback/advice is...am I being too optimistic to think there might still be a chance? If he really isn't interested, why not just unmatch with me on the app? At this point, I'm not planning on messaging him again unless/until I hear back from him. I guess I'm just trying to figure out whether or not I'm crazy or missing something or what...this just all seems a bit odd to me, but again, I haven't dated in a couple years.

My grandmother would come everyday before work and have a cup of coffee with her husband, and then they would get on the train together and start their days.
When their kids got older, my grandparents would bring them before school to have their pancakes. 
When my grandparents retired, they started bringing me and my brothers and cousins.
Now, 20 years later, I bring my boyfriend.
I grew up waiting in line for The Pantry to open during cold mornings, and it’s just how it always was, and it was ALWAYS worth it.
I would absolutely never wait in line for any other restaurant because I agree with every one of you’s, no place is worth the wait, ESPECIALLY for breakfast……..except for The Pantry.
Its charm has instilled a sense of community and comfort within me and all of my family for three generations.
We got in line this morning at 6:30am….and I wouldn’t have wanted to spend my Saturday any other way.
I understand that most of you may not have the same privilege to have a grand connection to this small greasy spoon that I do, but that doesn’t make this business any less special.

1j19eu3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j19eu3,Oahu & Maui Trip Report January 2025,"My 2025 Oahu & Maui Trip Report 

# Summary: 

* I spent \~5 days in Oahu and \~4 days in Maui in January 2025.
* I was remote working on East Coast hours, so worked 4am-12pm local time, and had from 12pm onwards everyday to explore.
* Oahu: I stayed in Waikiki. I went to Waikiki and North Shore,
* Maui: I stayed in Paia, Hana, and Kahului. I went to Haleakala, drove the Road to Hana, went up to the beaches past Lahaina, explored Paia and Kihei. I was injured so didn't get up to much hiking.

# Total $ spent: 

* I was operating on a mid-range budget. I split all costs with a friend.
* Oahu: I spent a little under $400 on accommodations (4 nights in Waikiki), \~$200 on food, $100 on a car, $30 on parking, and $105 on reservations for parks and a surf lesson. 
* Maui: I spent \~$380 on accommodations (2 nights Paia, 1 night Hana, 1 night Kahului, details below), $175 on food, $120 on a car, and $22 on reservations for entering parks.

# The Day by Day Breakdown

**Day 0: Sat 1/11**

* I spent most of the day flying from the East Coast, arrived in Honolulu (HNL) around 4:30pm.
* Ubered to accommodation, checked in.
* Walked to and around Waikiki Beach and watched the sunset, beach was very crowded but it's a really great view of sunset.
* Met up with my friend and grabbed a mini eel bowl at Musubi Cafe Iyasume - Very solid, eel is well-cooked / fresh, 7/10. The line is very long but it moves quickly, and food comes out fast. There's nowhere to sit so we got takeout. 
* Went to bed early to prep for early wakeup the next day.

**Day 1: Sun 1/12**

* Ubered back to the airport to pick up rental car at 5am.
* Drove to Lanikai Pillbox hike.
* Hiked Lanikai Pillbox - It's an awesome hike with beautiful views but we made the mistake of hiking it while it was raining (it wasn't raining when we started but it started raining when we were at the top) and on the way down it was super muddy and slippery, we and most of the people around us fell in the mud. It took us 3x as long to get down as it did to get up due to the mud.
* Grabbed a cold brew for the road from Rise & Grind, thought it was really good, 8/10.
* Drove to North Shore (\~1h) and saw 4 double rainbows along the way (crazy!)
* At North Shore, grabbed breakfast at Haleiwa Bowls at North Shore - I had the Mana Bowl, I don't usually eat açai (this was maybe my second time having it) but I thought it was good / fresh, a good portion, they were generous w/ the fruit. It's a little too sweet for me so 7/10 overall. My friend and I split the large size bowl since we had a full day of eating ahead of us.
* Saylor's - Had a cold brew and banana bread, both were incredible, 9/10. The banana bread is one of the best I've ever had - Kind of crispy outside really soft / moist inside, great texture / flavor. 
* Ka'ena Point Hike - We went up to Monk Seal Beach before turning around. It's a nice, easy, peaceful walk along the shore, the views are pretty similar throughout. 
* Lunch at Kono's North Shore - I was really underwhelmed. I had the kalua pork quesadilla, the pork was really really dry, it was only saved by the fact that it was in a quesadilla. 4/10.
* Matsumoto's - I'm going to hold off on my personal opinion here because I realized I just don't really like shave ice as a food (this was my first time trying it) - But my friend who likes shave ice preferred Kokonuts over Matsumoto's.
* Picked up some banana bread at Makua Banana Bread. It was expensive ($13 for a loaf) but worth it to me - It was delicious (tied with Saylor's for favorite banana bread ever) and that loaf served as my breakfast for the next few days. 
* Drove to Waimea Bay - Parking was difficult here on a Saturday afternoon as expected, but if you drive past the main part, there are other beaches along the bay with a lot more parking. The waves are pretty big so it's fun to watch the surfers!
* Drove to Kawela Bay - Quiet beach off the highway, very peaceful. I thought it was a nice stop, a bit out of our way. 
* Watched sunset at Kahe Point - Not my personal favorite sunset spot but still nice, it was over a cliff instead of on a beach before heading back / going to sleep. 

**Day 2: Mon 1/13**

* Started work at 4am.
* Went out for a walk and swim at Waikiki during my ""lunch"" break (12pm EST / 7am HST). I know Waikiki is usually really crowded but it's super peaceful just after sunrise, would recommend! You can't see the sunrise from the beach in January due to the direction it's facing but it's still a nice place to walk around / enjoy the water.
* Grabbed a beef udon from Musubi Cafe for lunch - I thought it was really good and decently filling for the price.
* After work we tried to go to Diamondhead (we had a reservation for 12-2pm) but they closed early that day (12:30) without emailing us (closure was listed on their website after we'd already made a reservation, they never notified us). I think they're closing early during the weekdays for a few months. They let us in the next day instead.
* Since Diamondhead was closed, we rerouted to Makupu'u Lighthouse Trail, stopping by some of the scenic viewpoints along the way. Thought the drive was fun and pretty.
* Makupu'u Lighthouse trail was short, pretty easy, a light uphill the whole way. It's very exposed and some areas get little to no wind so be prepared for the heat / bring lots of water. This trail had my favorite views of all the trails I did on Oahu.
* Went to Moena Sweets (Koko Marina) for some ice cream / to cool down. It's pretty expensive but the black sesame and kona coffee ice cream are fantastic.
* Hiked Koko Head! I found this hike really difficult despite spending a decent amount of time on the stairmaster (the steps are uneven so for a shorter person like me, the steps are hard), especially on a stomach full of ice cream (my mistake). There's a section of the trail that doesn't have a bottom under the rail tracks - Make sure to be extra careful there or take the path around (though that path looked kind of slippery / difficult too). We made it up in under 30 minutes but it was a *struggle*. Meanwhile we saw some locals using it as their afternoon jog, really quite humbling. The view at the top is really cool - If I had to guess I think the view would probably be better in the morning than in the afternoon (less hot too, so better conditions for the hike).
* Drove to Maunalua Bay to watch the sunset. It's a nice spot for sunset (huge parking lot, nice views, not crowded), but there's not really a beach. 
* Grabbed takeout from Mama Woo's (takeout restaurant) for dinner - I had BBQ chicken, bulgogi with vegetables & noodles. I thought the sides were good but the meat was kind of dry, 5.5/10. The people who work there are really nice and the portions are huge. 

**Day 3: Tues 1/14**

* Started work at 4am.
* Went for a walk at Waikiki Beach and went to Kona Coffee during my 7am ""lunch break."" IMO Kona is a bit overhyped - The line is really long / does not move very quickly and it's EXPENSIVE. The macadamia nut opera cake is quite good and so's the cold brew, but some of its other pastries aren't very impressive, like the black sesame koiugn amann (sorry lol, I know it's their most popular, it's kind of dry and there's not much sesame flavor it just tastes like sugar) and banana bread (really sweet, mediocre texture).
* Went to Maguro Spot for poke once it opened - Thought it was really good. Very fresh, overall just no complaints. It seemed a lot less busy in the late morning than in the evening.
* Hiked Diamondhead. Ngl I didn't find Diamondhead very impressive. It's about the same difficulty as Makupu'u but I didn't think the views were as good compared to Makupu'u and Kokohead. It was fun exploring the structures inside the mountain and it was still cool to see Waikiki and the shoreline from above. Imo, not worth the entry fee compared to the free hikes (also had a lot more people than the other hikes).
* Made a bunch of food stops while we still had the car: 
   * Nanding's Bakery - I was so excited for Nanding's when I saw its menu but I'm sad to say I thought it was below mid. We got 4 pastries, they tasted stale and there wasn't much flavor (ube, cinnamon tasted like sugar). I was really disappointed, 3/10.
   * Leonard's Bakery - The coconut malasada is out of this world. There was basically no line when I went around 2pm. 
   * Drove to Waiahole Poi Factory to try the Haupia ice cream - I was not expecting such a hefty portion for a single scoop lol. The ice cream was great, 7.5/10
* Stopped by Kailua Beach - Nice beach, waves were a little rough for inexperienced swimmers when we got there
* Stopped by Kuliouou Beach - You can't see sunset from here (blocked by trees) but there's a cool sandbar you can walk to, it feels like you're in the middle of the ocean AND there are a lot of dogs playing here (off-leash). Sand is super soft. 
* We dropped off the car at the airport and then went home, ate leftovers, went to sleep.

**Day 4: Weds 1/15**

* Started work at 4am.
* As part of my morning routine at this point, I took a walk at Waikiki Beach around sunrise. I also went to Halekulani Bakery and got a kona coffee kouign amann, which I didn't really like (4.5/10) and a cold brew (7.5/10).
* After work, we took a surf lesson with the Kahu School for \~$90 each for an hour. It was cool, they say 90% of their students stand up in the first lesson, and we did get to stand up, but I don't think they teach you ""proper"" technique or how to watch what wave to catch, and I also got injured during the lesson. 
* Afterwards, just hung out on Waikiki Beach, watched sunset, and had another bowl of poke from Maguro Spot. 

**Day 5: Thurs 1/16**

* Worked from 4am-12pm with the usual sunrise walk.
* Had the macadamia nut seared salmon bowl from Sato Seafood. I really liked this bowl, it's delicious and I've never seen it on a menu on the mainland so would highly recommend trying it!
* After work spent some time walking around downtown Waikiki area before heading to the airport for our flight to Maui in the afternoon.
* Once in Maui, picked up rental car from Hertz, and drove straight to our accommodation.
* We ate before our flight, so didn't grab any food in Maui this day.
* Watched the sunset at Baldwin Beach. It was super peaceful and beautiful and the sand is unbelievably soft.
* Went back to our accommodation to sleep (early wakeup).

**Day 6: Fri 1/17**

* Woke up at 4am and worked from 4am-12pm.
   * During the work day, we stepped out to watch sunrise at Ho'okipa Lookout. There's no direct view of the sunrise from the lookout, but the mountains are really beautiful in the early morning light and it was fun to watch the surfers.
   * Grabbed breakfast to go from Island Fresh Cafe in Paia. I had the breakfast burrito and cold brew. The burrito was a 4/10 (too much egg relative to everything else, bland, not worth the price), cold brew was good though.
* After work, grabbed lunch to go from Paia Fish Market. I think this will be an unpopular opinion but I didn't like Paia Fish Market. I got the fish quesadilla and would give it a 5/10, it tasted a bit sour and the cheese wasn't fully melted.
* Drove to 'Iao Valley State Monument, walked the path. It was a short visit, but the needle and surrounding area is beautiful and worth seeing. Reservations are required.
* From there, stopped by Kumu Farms to pick up a Maui Gold pineapple. This pineapple was maybe the best thing I ate on my trip. SO good. No need to go to Kumu Farms, Maui Golds are sold at so many places on the island!
* Drove up the coast to go to Slaughterhouse Beach. Past the resorts on the west, the roads get a bit narrower and windier, but not hard to drive until you go further up. Slaughterhouse Beach had some nice snorkeling, it's quiet / not crowded and waves are pretty big.
* Watched the sunset at Papalaua Wayside Park, a surprisingly nice spot for sunset (pullout by the road) and ate my leftovers for dinner before going to bed.

**Day 7: Sat 1/18**

For me this day was dedicated to driving the Road to Hana, since it was recommended to us to take one day to drive there and to stay in Hana overnight. Start early!!! There were far fewer cars on the road when we left just after sunrise around 7am, than later in the day.

* Grabbed a cold brew from Baked on Maui. It wasn't very good, really watered down.
* All my stops on Road to Hana:
   * Kaumahina State Wayside Park - Nice viewpoint and bathroom stop.
   * Honomanu - A lesser-known black sand beach. The road to get down there is a bit sketchy / windy.
   * Aunty Sandy's Banana Bread - I hope I don't attract hate for this... I thought the banana bread here was *really* bad. It was dry, doughy, and once it was no longer warm, I thought it tasted like a brick. Sorry.
   * Keanae Lookout - Great place to watch huge waves crash over the rocks.
   * Nua'ailua Bay Lookout - My personal favorite lookout on the RTH.
   * Wailua Valley Lookout - Lookout over the hills / ocean, parking is limited.
   * Pua'a Ka'a State Wayside - Bathrooms available here, along with a swimmable waterfall (it is very cold)!
   * Coconut Glen's - A personal highlight of the RTH. The coconut & coffee toffee ice cream was incredible. They also have banana bread, young coconut, etc.
   * Cajun Fresh / Cocoa Bananas Farm - Roadside stop with a bathroom, fresh fruit, lookouts. It was nice and peaceful!
   * Hana Lava Tube - I didn't go in because I'm not that into caves and it was kind of expensive (I think $10?) but my friend thought it was cool.
   * Huli Huli Chicken - Located past Hana by Koki Beach, cash only ($20), sometimes they sell out early. The chicken tastes good, but it's not mind-blowing.
   * Koki Beach (Red sand beach) - More like red pebble beach in reality... it's a nice spot to enjoy your huli huli chicken :)
   * 'Ohe'o Gulch - I regret visiting here because we got a flat tire on our way back. The water was dirtier than I expected.
   * We had reservations for and were supposed to visit Waiʻānapanapa State Park but weren't able to because of our flat tire. Our hotel (will mention below) was so nice and helped us change it, whereas our rental car company (Hertz) was absolutely useless.

**Day 8: Sun 1/19**

* We left early (\~7am) and drove back to Kahului on our spare tire to exchange our rental car.
* After getting the car, we got some food. There's a food truck park in Kihei with lots of good food. Had the Lilikoi caramel french toast at Blue Door, which was surprisingly good (7.5/10), and a decent cold brew at Da Green Coffee Shop. The food highlight of the day was at Aloha Prime. The Hoisin chicken plate was an easy 8/10.
* Went to Keawakapu Beach to swim and walk around, the beach is behind 2 hotels but has public access and parking is free. The sand is really soft and the area's good for snorkeling, you can see turtles!
* Grabbed some ice cream at Artisan Ice Cream in Paia. The coconut coffee is so good, easy 9/10. We also checked out the shops in Paia, they had some interesting stuff, as expected, all very expensive.
* We tried to go to Haleakala for sunset and were turned away because we arrived too late. Pro tip, drive up *early!* Ended up catching the sunset at Keawakapu Beach instead, thought it was a decent spot.
* Returned to the food truck park for dinner. This time I went to Kitoko and had the Mahi mahi bento. It was really pricey for the portion. The fish was really well-cooked, great texture, but the sauce was pretty bad IMO.
* Went to sleep due to early wakeup next day.

**Day 9: Mon 1/20**

* Had the day off from work. We left around 2:30am, drove about an hour to get to the sunrise at Haleakala, on the advice of a ranger, who told us to arrive before 3:30am. IMO, it was a bit too early. There was a good amount of parking at the top. Unpopular opinion, people say the best part of the show starts before sunrise... I thought the best views were 5 min after sunrise. It was an awesome experience overall.
* After sunrise spent a couple hours in Haleakala (visitor center, driving around, stopping) and then headed back down to Kihei for food.
* Stopped by Crema Maui to grab some breakfast. It's a really cute cafe created from an old school bus. Almond croissant was pretty good but too oily, cortado was decent.
* Back to Keawakapu Beach for a final beach swim.
* Grabbed some food for the flight out. Almond butter toast w/ strawberries at Da Green was decent, banana bread at Blue Door was good.
* Drove to the airport and returned the rental car before flying out.

# Accommodation

[Beach Condo](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/648123817666825032?source_impression_id=p3_1740860998_P3OxmC3DVNGFsQYG) (Waikiki): \~$200/night. We were looking for a relatively inexpensive, walkable option where it'd be easy to work without distractions in Waikiki. The space is pretty small but it's clean, not cluttered, and well-decorated with interesting trinkets. It's very thoughtfully laid out / equipped, including sunscreen, beach chairs, lots of coat hanging space, a desk, effective earplugs, balcony, etc., so overall very happy with the stay! We had an issue with the wifi during our stay and the hosts were very responsive / came to fix it immediately, so 10/10 for communication. 

[Mike's House Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1752128) (Paia): $200 / night. Upsides: Private room w/ attached private bathroom & mini-fridge in a shared house / kitchen. Nice amenities, clean, roomy, comes with attached sunroom. Downsides: There are a lot of extra (optional) charges - Parking (even though the owner of the Airbnb owned the parking - we ended up just parking on the street), luggage storage (expensive too), etc.

[Hana Inn](https://hanainn.com/) (Hana): $180 / night. I consider this a great deal. It's a private room / private bathroom in a refurbished inn. You can tell the inn is a bit old but it's not an issue. Great, spacious rooms, really cute (leashed cat) up front, free coffee / fresh fruit available for guests. The staff are really, really nice and helpful (fixed our flat tire). Great option for a stay in Hana.

[Howzit Hostels](https://www.howzithostels.com/) (Kahului): $200 / night. Had a private room / shared bathroom. I wasn't a fan of this stay. There was no parking nearby, so we had to park \~10 min away, and we saw someone screaming expletives at passing cars during our walk over. The whole area felt a bit sketchy and it took forever for the hostel staff to answer the door at 10pm at night. There was a ton of food in the fridge that had mold on it... so did the water filter in the fridge - pretty gross. The rooms are fine and the people staying here seem generally friendly. It was fine for a budget option (1 night, left really early for sunrise anyways) but I wouldn't recommend it.

1. ***Mysore Sandal by ML Ramnarain*** : Good quality sandalwood attar, quite potent, I personally do not like it on skin as top and mid journey is fine, but by the dry down there is something which is too much for me to handle, something sour, sharp and heavy. Decided to keep it for diffusers and rituals. Once added 2 drops to Hawan Kund and the entire house literally got lifted up to some different realm for a few minutes. Somehow will try to learn to use it on skin as well.
2. ***Jasmine Attar from local shop in Munnar, Kerala selling tea as well :*** Got this way back in 2017 , love it due to nostalgic reasons, reminds me of Kerala and Malayalam cinema. It is an indolic one with subtle sweetness as well as well as it is gender fluid. If you are travelling to Munnar do explore a big tea shop in Munnar, they have variety of attars. They sell cakes, tea as well attars I guess.
3. ***Attar Khalisi from Zamindar Kesar King :*** My sister got this from her Kashmir trip many years ago, it's almost 10 years old now. Soapy in beginning but after it settles, it is very soothing and calming saffron sightly sweet as well, I thought I will never like saffron as a frag note,but... saffron is absolute love for me now.
4. ***Shrungar by Perito Moreno:*** It has jasmine and rose and many other ingredients, there is this mint which doesn't work for me or I have not learnt to use it yet, I also see prices increasing for this while being on sale. I would recommend Culture Perfume for similar notes.

**FOREST ESSENTIAL :**

1. ***Gulnar Intese Perfume***: My most favourite rose, it is a combination of rose and carnation with desi vibes, a lil sweet. projection on clothes is beyond 36 hours for me, I have a sensitive nose. Few other rose fav are = Eau Rose by Diptyque + la colle noire by Dior. I thought I liked Delinas but I'm not vibing with those again. For those who like rose, Gulnar is a must have, do yourself a favour and get the 10ml travel size. I'm yet to try MFK a la rose + few most loved from Fredreic Malle, so my review is coming from this angle as well, sharing this info as it will help readers understand and make better decision. I tried Scherzo from Miller Harris which is loved by many, but the dry down too sweet for me, same is with Mancera Rose Vanille, too sweet.
2. ***Chandani Ratein Perfume :*** Jasmine based fragrance. I liked it when I tried it for the first time, but IMO it is not worth it at all, moreover I get synthetic feels from it, also it causes dry coughing and I find it causes allergy, I have healthy lungs so the issue is not with me but this formulation. Not meant to offend those who like for variety of reasons, but there are much better options out there, and many good attars as well. FE Amrita is another better option while exploring FE frags.
3. ***Mallika Intense Perfume***: One more rat ki rani based, I think it is not available anymore, they launched it last year. Good that they discontinued it, it was worst white floral I tried similar to Jasmin Sensual from Oriflame, which was another bad formulation and straight up nail polish remover.
4. ***FE Jasmine and Mogra mist and Oil*** : Very pretty jasmine, the mist is a bit alcoholic, but the oil is lovely, very pretty and soothing vibes, even the lotion is nice. I guess this range is not available anymore now.
5. ***Nargis Body Mist*** : It is nargis based mist, but too strong for my nose, I have only used this for spraying in and around my washroom. Other nargis based from FE is Amrita which is a pretty formulation, second best from FE after Gulnar.
6. ***Sandalwood and Vetiver :*** Too strong and weird to my nostrils, I don't like vetiver I've realised. Vetiver triggers nausea. However, Sandalwood can be identified here. The body mists from FE are quite strong and have great longevity, though none works for me.
7. ***Rose Talcum and Mashobra Honey and Vanilla Talcum :*** Both are quite pretty talcums, those who like rose will love this rose and those who like vanilla will love the there one.

**CHANEL :**

1. ***Chance Eau Vive EDT*** : It is a combination of some lovely florals, Iris and musks, but inspite of having sensitive nose, I do not pick anything from this. Also there is something bitter, so a No for me.
2. ***Misia EDP*** : I wont go into the notes, but this is straight up Lipstick with waxy feels.
3. ***No 22 EDP*** : Quite aldehydic with some lovely notes, but ylang ylang and Vetiver start showing towards the dry down and it doesn't work for me.
4. ***No 5 l'eau*** : As the name suggests watered down version of the OG Chanel no 5, this one is nice, may be collection worthy, but I tried it one day on an outing and it didn't wow me the way it did during some me time, will I buy a FB or a decant, nah...however this is better than a lot of Chanels
5. ***Coco Mademoiselle eau vive EDT*** : I forgot how coco mademoiselle smells but the it was the first chanel I tried due to the hype and I did not like that at all. I have no idea if there are similarities between this and CM, but I'm not a fan of lychee. Not for me
6. ***Eau Fraiche*** : I liked it when I tried it at the store, but after sampling and trying it for the first time, I would say this is a great one from Chanel for summers, very fresh, if you are ohk with the incense-y ness it emits. Personally a No for me as I do not enjoy incense-y-ness, it destroyed so many good fragrances for me, to name a few-> Valaya, DelinaX, Chanel Coromandel, PDM Palatine
7. ***Paris- Riveria*** : This has a combination of citrus fruits and white florals which is too sharp in the beginning, would be a better option for male folk.
8. ***Gabrielle*** : The SA was a hesitant to show me this due to sensitive nose issue and my choices, but I would consider buying this in future, it is beautiful white floral fragrance, slightly bubbly due to citruses, better than Gabrielle sensual imo. Apt as an occasion wear and otherwise too.
9. ***1957*** : It is sophisticated musky fragrances, Some magic starts happening may be due to iris or the overall blending which is very ladylike. Vanilla is shown in the base notes, but I do not get any vanilla. I have small 4ml (how cute are these minis) and would be testing it for some time, still not confident to go for FB, as I find there something lil, very lil sharpness due to overload of musks. Also, the price is astronomical and is expected to go up this year.
10. ***Paris-Paris*** : This was love at first sniff. Combination of Damask rose and patchouli. Patchouli is faint here. I went for FB, but at times I find it a bit sharp. Similar to la colle noir from Dior. Also worth exploring is lotion by the same name.
11. ***Paris- Vensie :*** My most fav fragrance, citrus in the beginning and the vanilla here is so soft, the only vanilla I liked or I think I could ever like and tolerate. also there is rose and hints of faint iris. I'm glad I found this one. Signature scent worthy. Only con: vanishes too fast, but the trick lies in it being matured and using it on clothes. The only one I would buy again. Note : This doesn't project at all. similar to Dior amour by Dior.
12. ***No 19 Poudre and La Pausa :*** Keeping these two together as they have a common note, a green note. Looking at the notes, gree+iris+ jasmine, I thought this will be a holy grail for me, but the green note is something else, I had experienced galbanum as well as neroli and I like them both, but here it is something different, these two triggered nausea to such an extent, I had multiple episodes of vomiting and that too in peak Delhi traffic, that too at peak afternoon, that too at Barapulla flyover, that too when I was all alone, I couldn't even stop the damn vehicle & run anywhere, thank god there was a big tin dabba in car, only I know how I reached back home. I never thought I would get nauseated due to a fragrance, but....

NOTE : Few others worth exploring from Chanel are = Coco EDT, even Coco is nice, I prefer EDT over EDP. Coromandel (My eyes burn from this due to frankincense, otherwise beautiful), Boy, Gardenia( I personally do not enjoy tuberose, and prefer Jasmin over tuberose always, otherwise great blending), Comete ( I wanted to love it, but cherry blossom at the top didn't work for me), Paris-Edimbourg over Paris-Deauville & Paris-Biarritz.

**ARTISAN DIXIT/ PERITO MORENO :**

1. ***Meditation Mist:*** I like this in comparison to others, to me it is a combination of cinnamon, cloves and vanilla. Surprisingly, on skin cloves vanish and what remains is warm cinnamon and vanilla. Good for winters. I see a lot similarity to Diptyque's 34St Boulevard.
2. ***Culture*** : It has been praised by many in the sub here. Smooth rose, jasmine and sandalwood.
3. ***Citrus and Yuzu*** : Zesty and sweet. It is fresh, yet heavy.
4. ***Regal Silhouette*** : Too much paan feels in the beginning, personally I do not enjoy mint, it goes away in few minutes , there is something similar to Thumri, which is heavier and has more character than RS. Thumri is apt for someone who is experimental and love attending Indian Classical concerts.
5. ***King's Empire*** : Sandalwood and Cedar combo, nice but doesn't wow me. I tried a lot but it confuses me and I don't get much from this. Again imo this is dupe of the OG Tam Dao from Diptyque, still wondering why no one here has been able to see this.
6. **Not Dark Yet** : Much more sophisticated and statement worthy when compared to King's empire. Comparing because there are similarities between these two. never like gourmand frags, but this one is yummy and alluring, I do not care a bit its meant for men, definitely getting at least 10ml as this would be enough for me. Also this has chocolate note somewhere in the base, may be that is what is making it yummy. I usually stay away from gourmands frag as my hunger vanishes and I cannot eat anything after that, but that problem doesn't occur here. I get sandalwood, cinnamon and nutmeg from it. I stay away from cardamon in perfumes, but the blending here is great.
7. ***Nightingale*** : This is from Dixit and Zak, what an incredible fragrance, I wish I could get my hands on their sandalwood ones and some others too. I only have a 2ml sample of this, this one has ""chameli oil"" vibes but so nostalgic. Not feminine imo. Earlier I thought of keeping it for my partner, but not now, somethings are meant to kept for the memory sake only. It reminds my childhood in the mountains and all Sundays when my father would take me to barbershop with him to get the damn boycut hair. I wish I could draw all the scenes that it reminds me of when I sniff it. Whenever I smell it, I feel safe, as if nothing wrong could ever happen because my father and all my uncles are all here. Reminds me of all childhood memories when I would sit on his shoulder on long hikes in the mountains and I thought my father is a superhero which he still is , touchwood ❤️😇. Thank you guys Dixit and Zak for this one.

*NOTE* : Almost all Perito Moreno frag are male oriented, still they can be pulled off by ladies as well, some that I would recommend are Culture, meditation mist and Not dark yet. If someone here can send Nitish Dixit a request, kindly ask him to make something targeted towards females as well, he was onto something called Queen's empire but it never came out.

**SANTA MARIA NOUVELLA** :

1. ***L'iris:*** Iris with initial burst of Neroli, white florals, jasmine here is too pretty, a lit spicy, subtle bitterness is there but absolute hit for me as it reminds me something that made me a frag lover. Must have for those who prefer Iris. Iris is raw here, not your pretty woman soft iris.
2. ***Melograno*** : Fresh out of shower frag with slight powderyness, my first experience with a pomegranate note and I'm enjoying it.
3. ***Rosa Nouvella***: Fresh spicy rose, much better than a lot of roses in the market. But the vetiver in the base makes it a little non-feminine and this comes out as a surprise in the drydwon. Still much better rose than a lot roses in the market.
4. ***Rosa Gardenia*** : Rose is pretty but the fig blending is so tasteless, a fail. Not that I do not enjoy fig, diptyque Philosykis is a great take on fig, so fresh and juicy.
5. ***Pot Pourri*** : A mix of spices as the name suggests, camphoroous with cloves. Similar to the what our mother's would give us when we catch cold. A complete no for me as it reminds me fever.
6. ***Bizzaria*** : Do not like how Davana has been used here with florals. Davana is a wonderful note only if used properly, I will talk about a great Davana based formulation at the end of this entire write up.
7. ***Magnolia*** : A magnolia based fragrance with rose and green-ness. Overall pretty but something is there which triggers nausea so a no for me. Melograno is better than Magnolia imo.
8. ***Gelsomino*** : This is a jasmine fragrance, nice, much better than a lot where tuberose is added in heavy amounts and the delicate jasmine gets lost. It is green, there is some bitterness as well, plus it vanishes, no projection, no sillage. A no for me. Imo Diptyque's Olene is better than Gelsomino.
9. ***Tobacco Tuscana*** : I stay far away from tobacco note, but what a great combo of Tobacco with Vanilla.
10. ***Fressia :*** A freesia and rose. It is nice fragrance, violet makes it pretty , but there is something in it which make me sick and triggers nausea. Complete No.

NOTE : Worth Exploring imo are = L'iris, Melograno, Rosa Nouvella, Tobacco Tuscana. Rest which are hyped i.e Angel De Firenze and Aqua Della Regina did not work for me.

**LILANUR :**

1. ***Malli Insolite*** : A combination of Jasmin sambac, Jasmin gradiflorum, tuberose, pink pepper and mineral notes . This is realistic blooming mogras, but slight metallic-ness creeps in after some time.
2. ***Rajni Nocturne*** : I'will be frank, it's a combination of tuberose and jasmine and ylang ylang and one of the worst fragrances I ever tried, so bitter and off putting, or may be it is clear I do not like tuberose. I like something in it, but then it gets too bitter. For those who like tuberose much better options are love tuberose by Amouage, Jasmin des Anges, jasmine rouge from tom ford which is tuberose bomb imo. Also, their Tuberose Absolute attar is a realistic tuberose, doesn't get too ahead and turn bitter, sad part it remains flat and one has to bury their nose to even smell it.
3. ***Vetiver Monsoon*** : Initial burst is so earthy with hints of jasmine, too pretty and satisfying just like the first rain of monsoon season, but after that there is bitterness through and through.
4. ***Davana Cedre*** : What a creation, kudos to the perfumer ! It is not a fragrance with any fragrance as such but such an interesting formulation. This is straight up ""Chilam"" if any of you here understands what a chilam is, it is similar to ""Hooka"" but one used by females in northern India I guess. So earthy with some smokiness, induces craving for Gili mitti. This might not be similar to a Bar's Hookah, but very earthy, I have no idea what a hookah at bar smells or tastes like, but clearly know what is smell of a hookah and chilam as my both my grandfather and grandmother used them often.
5. ***Incarnation :*** What a Chypre bomb, but beware as the orris/labdanum here can be too much and headache inducing near the dry down. Gorgeous jasmine, rose, orris. I wish they did not add labdanum here, this would have been such a hit. Temple vibes with dressed up ladies flocking here and there.
6. ***Agar Epice***: Oud and Sandalwood combo is what I get. Oud is soft here and blends with other notes with much ease. I stay away from even trying oud as it is either too sweet or turns animalic. AE triggers some nostalgia of a lost memory which is so hard for me to explain or find. I've always loved finding secrets and my head is solving mysteries half of the time, and not able to find a lost memory while feeling longing and pain is so disturbing, my fragrance journey if not ends, changes after this experience. Will stay far far away from any oud and sandalwood combo, as I literally turn into Karan and Arjun from Karan Arjun movie lol.
7. ***Gul Rouge***: Combo of Rose Centifolia, Damascus rose and honey. Nice rose fragrance, watery rose, not light but very heavy. I will say Gulnar from FE is much better than this one imo. Only good part is when that Damascus rose starts shining before the dry down or after 2 hours which is like magic, however I do not when the dry down happens as it remains on clothes more than 24 hours. One spray is enough, otherwise cloying.
8. ***Zafran Boise***: I wanted to gatekeep this fragrance, yes :P, not because I do not like sharing, but I fear it might be a small stock. Plus it is not available online, I'll not even know if that is the last bottle and I should jump ahead and get it lol. This is the most beautiful fragrance I ever sniffed, sadly it cannot be pulled off as unisex and is meant for men only, otherwise I would have bought it the first time I tried it at store, also it was not even a part of discovery set. It has opening of saffron and dried rose and some faint spices, just tooo beautiful, but after 20 mins, it had woody notes coming out, still nice, but by the next morning, my hand turned into a man's arm. So this is meant for men only imo. I just hope this doesn't go out of stock.

NOTE : All fragrances from Lilanur are interesting, but none too alluring to spend around that much amount, I wish they launched at least 3.5 ml samples and did a little extra marketing here in India. However, all are quite potent 1-2 sprays are enough.

**SOME RANDOM SAMPLES:**

1. ***Olene EDT from Diptyque*** : Subtle photorealistic jasmine with green hints, not pretty but just real jasmine bush. Light and fresh. Highly recommend. It's an EDT so kindly try on clothes for longevity.
2. ***BR 540 MFK :*** By now most of folks know the note profile, A complete No for me. Medicinal feels with overdose of sweetness. As many know by now, Zara's red temptation is nearly perfect dupe of it.
3. ***Amouage Lilac Love*** : Nice, but heavy. I get jasmine, roses,lilac and lot other florals. Worth sampling but no FB worthy. I like the whiffs I get from it. Also how lovely are these sample boxes from Amougae, also these samples come with cap, so no issue of leakage, I might get only 2 more samples of this for the sake of lilac.
4. ***Amougae Love Tuberose*** : Great take on tuberose. Recommend for tuberose seekers. Creamy tuberose imo.
5. ***VS Bare Rose*** : Synthetic metallic rose, my 2.5k wasted in a miniature from nyka. Not reccommnded at all.
6. ***Valaya:*** Super pretty citrusy, but that ambroxan destroyed it for me, I felt so pretty, uplifted mood and what not wearing this, but that incense-y-ness ohh no no. I wonder if I'll ever find a summer fresh frag. Need recommendations ? as I do not own a single freshy
7. ***Dama Bianca*** ***Xerjoff :*** As mentioned by many influencers I do not find it pretty or fluffy, it is heavy on vanilla. Not recommended. Also I get something medicinal from this. May be that is where the western taste differs from ours. Too gourmand-ish. I had to scrub it off the first and the only time I tried it.
8. ***Eau Duelle EDT From Diptyque*** : What a great take on Vanilla, it is a fresh vanilla as if kept in the kitchen of a wooden cottage somewhere in a dark green wet forest. Highly recommend for vanilla seekers.
9. ***Fluer de peau by Diptyque***: Cold but pretty and aloof iris. Not blind buy worthy at all, but worth sampling. Not recommended for winters. Powdery but cold like a whisper.
10. ***La Violette Annick Goutal*** : After searching on the net and as per the notes, I got a tester bottle of this one after trying it at the MDP store, I do not think it performs that well, a lil cold and sharp this one is. It is a combination of Violet, violet leaf and rose. There is something too alluring around during drown but overall doesn't work for me.
11. ***Rose Pompom EDP by Annick Goutal*** : Eww just too sweet and sour this is. A bomb of sweetness and sourness. Seeing the damask rose I sampled it, also may be I tried EDT version and really loved the rose in it and ordered EDP, but it doesn't work. EDP also has raspberry as the top note so may be that is at play here.
12. ***Taif Rose, Jasmin de pays, Rose de Mai from PMC*** : There is some note common note in all there of these fragrances which is too off putting, A total no for me. I thought there is something wrong with me so I asked few strangers at the MDP store to try sniffing the blotter and they all disliked it. Not even worth sampling imo, if you go to the MDP store, try it there.
13. **I*****ris Fauve by Atelier des ors*** : A heavy and sweet cinnamon-y Iris, it is sweet but would be perfect for extreme winters. There is something in the dry down which is too beautiful to be put into words. But this is suited for extreme winters only, otherwise it can be too cloying. Worth trying.
14. ***Rose Omeyyade Atelier des ors*** : Much better rose in comparison to many others. I guess it is damask rose at play here. There is oud and sandalwood in the base. A good one as a winter occasion wear, much better than velvet rose and oud from Jo Malone.
15. ***Jasmin Sambac and Marigold from Jo Malone:*** It was recommended by many here as a Jasmin forward fragrance, but this one did not work for me at all, as it getter bitter may be due to ylang ylang.
16. ***Silver Birch and Lavender by Jo Malone*** : I personally loed it on the blotter so far, I have not tried on skin yet. It is a combination of lavender and woody notes, worth exploring for purple flower seekers.
17. ***Boise Corse by Diptyque:*** It has coffee as a hero note here, slightly sweet coffee with Tonka beans and sandalwood, worth exploring for those looking for a coffee based perfume.
18. ***Rose Roche by Diptyque:*** Nice lime and rose combo, does get a lil bitter, the bitterness is not something extra but is coming from the natural character of lime. Gives dessert-y feels, worth exploring but wouldn't recommend blind buying as it is from their private collection and prices are off the charts. I see someone mentioned it is similar to Paris, it is not, while rose Roche has desert vibes, Paris Paris from chanel is far away from that and is a bit feminine.
19. ***Lilyphea by Diptque:*** Only perfume with an ozonic note that I could tolerate without nausea getting triggered. Definitely worth exploring. Very pretty and fresh in the top notes. Projection and longevity might be an issue here. Do give it a try if you are at a Diptyque store.
20. ***Joy EDP by Jean Patou***: This is praised so much by many frag critics, combo of jasmine, tuberose, rose with ylang ylang. I sense something groundbreaking in the background but what comes in the front something tooo sharp, either the miniature I have has gone bad or may be it doesn't work for me. Stays beyond 2 days for me and projects.
21. ***Eau Rose by Diptyque EDP*** : A beautiful realistic rose, little feminine. Gets sweeter in the middle notes. Highly recommend this rose. Even the EDT is nice. I wish there was a hybrid of EDP top notes and EDT top notes, nevertheless both of these are nice.
22. ***Do Son by Diptyque:*** Great take on tuberose, fresh and uplifting. Worth sampling for those who love tuberose.
23. ***Philosykos EDT by Diptyque***: Fruity, what a great take on fig note. I totally abhor when fig is blended with some other notes and thought I hate fig, but here it is alone on its own and this is so fruity and fresh and green as if you have landed in a heavenly orchard.

STORY BEHIND TURNING INTO A FRAG HEAD :

The first time I fell in love with fragrance was because of my newly married aunt. I was so mesmerised as a barely 6 year old girl, I would beg her to give me her handkerchief, to this day I remember that mustard handkerchief. I almost forgot my love for ""khushboo"" while growing up as my mother too has a sensitive nose and skin and stayed away from cosmetics as much as she could. But my love for a beautiful scent was always well known in my family. Even as a school girl back in early 2000s I would take a little 30 ml local perfume with an American flag in my school bag lol ( in case anyone knows or remembers please let me know its name). I was badly shamed for bringing perfume to school, it was such a haww moment. Then life took over, I would use whatever my cousins got, then my first job perfume was Oriflame muse, so pretty it was. I tried few here and there while visiting malls, but was never determined to get a new one. Got few attars and was ohk as I got so busy in the later half of my 20s running after goals, I almost forget to take care of myself, just followed physical training, as if those years were completely lost, whoosh in a second.

Then after many years I was in Agra and Vrindavan and got some flowers for festival decor. Got bunches of Roses and Mogras and let me tell you Roses grown around Greater Noida, Aligarh and nearby patch of land is so so beautiful and smells di-vine and majorly used in most of the temples of Vrindavan. I had these flowers in my room, the moment I entered back after some time, I got whiff of the most heavenly and divinely beautiful fragrance. This was not the first time I was sniffing flowers, growing up in the far away mountains of Uttarakhand , I had experienced all kinds of flowers in garden, met some saints in small cottages who were gifted Swiss rose by one of their European disciple, and we had it in the garden for many years, these roses would grown in bunches rather than individual flowers, my mother would often make rose water and delicacies. Sadly, these flowers didn't bloom at all in the plains weather. Also I had close relation to mogras as a classical dance practitioner, mogras are always around , either in dance class or in home decor, in gajras. Cut to present, what I experienced that day in room with those flowers mesmerised me once again.

I guess it was nearly this time I had this bizarre dream, where I'm a bride but in a Nikkah setting, despite of I me being a Hindu. As strange as it was and not getting into the details, what I could sense is the fragrance, I felt so beautiful, and the fragrance on me was so Godamn beautiful, that fragrance, search for that fragrance had me running here and there since almost a year, the way a Musk deer runs here and there to look for fragrance, the same way I was on a hunt to find that fragrance. I have not been able to find that fragrance but I'm glad I could smell something in Liris which is akin to my newly married aunt's handkerchief and hence my soul is somewhat satisfied to at least find something if not ""the thing"".

Cut to next, I tried Agar Epice from Lilanur and I almost had an entire post about this, trying to cut the story short, this one took me into some sort of spirals down the memory lane which is hazy and confusing. It reminded me Azans from Mosque, some place with neem trees, water body and sunset with oarge painted skies. I always had a liking for azans and sunsets, not that I was crazy but it is such a soul food for me, also I'm a die hard of NFAK music, much before this generation fell for it. I had many dreams in the past 2-3 years where I'm constantly in a muslim setting since the nikkah dream, then I get some other dream after almost 1.5 year where I'm travelling and I meet someone in a cave sort of tunnel and all of a sudden an old man with long beard does some magic with pink coloured sand & it turned into some ""w"" symbol kept on a green velvet cloth, and he asks me bow down to it, after few days I randomly start googling this ""W and a sword beside it"" symbol and come to know it is the name of Allah and that is how it is written, this freaked the shit out of me.

Cut to next, after 7-8 months I meet a guy for an arrange marriage setting and this was the first time I was meeting someone in such a setting , and the very same night I see a dream where I'm in an old blue coloured home in a village, and seeing off the guy and his family, and suddenly two big goats start running after me and we had a bizarre eye contact, one of the goat and me, creepy enough. Then all of us start entering a dargarh and the guy who came meet me introduces himself to the guys at the entrance as my shauhar, I mean What !!! Then all of sudden all people move ahead and I'm left alone, in some slippery place within dargah and fall down, and, I ask folks to help me get up, but they start saying Tauba and something else too, and don not help me at all. I feel so weak and I'm not able to get up, I wake up out of dream in the morning .

Overall freaky, and this combo of oud and sandalwood in agar Epice triggered nostalgia, and I want to sniff it again and again and almost crave something which even I have no idea of. Strangely I tried remembering details of the nikkah dream because this bloody mind is curious, I remember myself on terrace being a bride, a long veil, a woman in burkha siting beside me on a daybed sort of a thing on terrace, its about to get dark, and I could see a guy, I never focused on the guy as I was running behind ""the frag"", but this Agar Epice meddles with my mind in such a way, now I'm trying to track details of a dream I saw almost 3 years back, so the guy is shaking hands with some 2-3 men when he reaches terrace via a staircase, I could see his eyes for a second maybe, its not an eye contact as I have this long veil on, so I could see him but I think he couldn't see my face,I'm also not sure if he is the groom because he isn't dressed up like one but is wearing Kurta, strangely the guy has some similar vibes to the guy who was my first crush in school, but he is not the same person, his eyes, ""those eyes"". are different., the eyes are not even kind. What is frustrating is I'm trying to remember his face now almost after 3 years and I'm not able to remember and that is pissing me off, I do not want to go down this rabbit hole, but this mind plays tricks. Considering how sensitive religious topics are, this is not meant to hurt anyone's sentiments, there was no other way I could have shared my story without getting into the details.

What is little strange which I almost forgot and thought my mind is playing tricks, is that my mother was helped immensely by a muslim neighbour, who was my father's manager's wife when my mom was expecting me, while she was in Baroda Gujrat far far away from her home town which is in NCR. The lady would often make breakfast for my mom, father and would take my elder sister to her home to feed her along with her kids. My fast pace intense frag journey ends here as I do not want to think much about all this anymore, now that I have thought so much about this entire thing , clearly this has gone to my conscious and subconscious and anything if ever happens again in my dream will be an outcome of all this as per my logic. Keeping safe distance from anything oud and sandalwood. Sadly I couldn't find that dream fragrance which was my pivotal point in this entire journey and something else hit me after testing Agar Epice, also I have now almost forgotten what that fragrances was after trying almost 200 fragrances in an years span. And let me say it looks all made up until it hits you one day. Many fragrances have not been mentioned here as I do not find them appealing and they have been mentioned by someone somewhere here in the sub, pushing those breaks on this journey after eating SA's head in every other store I visited.

So I am looking for a suggestions where I could sit comfortably and do my work for 4-7 hours. 

I was thinking about starbucks or kaffemisjon but it is a city center so I might be annoying to the coffee employees as I will take a place. I am willing to drink 2-3 coffees during that period if that helps :D

**ATTARS :**

1. ***Mysore Sandal by ML Ramnarain*** : Good quality sandalwood attar, quite potent, I personally do not like it on skin as top and mid journey is fine, but by the dry down there is something which is too much for me to handle, something sour, sharp and heavy. Decided to keep it for diffusers and rituals. Once added 2 drops to Hawan Kund and the entire house literally got lifted up to some different realm for a few minutes. Somehow will try to learn to use it on skin as well.
2. ***Jasmine Attar from local shop in Munnar, Kerala selling tea as well :*** Got this way back in 2017 , love it due to nostalgic reasons, reminds me of Kerala and Malayalam cinema. It is an indolic one with subtle sweetness as well as well as it is gender fluid. If you are travelling to Munnar do explore a big tea shop in Munnar, they have variety of attars. They sell cakes, tea as well attars I guess.
3. ***Attar Khalisi from Zamindar Kesar King :*** My sister got this from her Kashmir trip many years ago, it's almost 10 years old now. Soapy in beginning but after it settles, it is very soothing and calming saffron sightly sweet as well, I thought I will never like saffron as a frag note,but... saffron is absolute love for me now.
4. ***Shrungar by Perito Moreno:*** It has jasmine and rose and many other ingredients, there is this mint which doesn't work for me or I have not learnt to use it yet, I also see prices increasing for this while being on sale. I would recommend Culture Perfume for similar notes.

**FOREST ESSENTIAL :**

1. ***Gulnar Intese Perfume***: My most favourite rose, it is a combination of rose and carnation with desi vibes, a lil sweet. projection on clothes is beyond 36 hours for me, I have a sensitive nose. Few other rose fav are = Eau Rose by Diptyque + la colle noire by Dior. I thought I liked Delinas but I'm not vibing with those again. For those who like rose, Gulnar is a must have, do yourself a favour and get the 10ml travel size. I'm yet to try MFK a la rose + few most loved from Fredreic Malle, so my review is coming from this angle as well, sharing this info as it will help readers understand and make better decision. I tried Scherzo from Miller Harris which is loved by many, but the dry down too sweet for me, same is with Mancera Rose Vanille, too sweet.
2. ***Chandani Ratein Perfume :*** Jasmine based fragrance. I liked it when I tried it for the first time, but IMO it is not worth it at all, moreover I get synthetic feels from it, also it causes dry coughing and I find it causes allergy, I have healthy lungs so the issue is not with me but this formulation. Not meant to offend those who like for variety of reasons, but there are much better options out there, and many good attars as well. FE Amrita is another better option while exploring FE frags.
3. ***Mallika Intense Perfume***: One more rat ki rani based, I think it is not available anymore, they launched it last year. Good that they discontinued it, it was worst white floral I tried similar to Jasmin Sensual from Oriflame, which was another bad formulation and straight up nail polish remover.
4. ***FE Jasmine and Mogra mist and Oil*** : Very pretty jasmine, the mist is a bit alcoholic, but the oil is lovely, very pretty and soothing vibes, even the lotion is nice. I guess this range is not available anymore now.
5. ***Nargis Body Mist*** : It is nargis based mist, but too strong for my nose, I have only used this for spraying in and around my washroom. Other nargis based from FE is Amrita which is a pretty formulation, second best from FE after Gulnar.
6. ***Sandalwood and Vetiver :*** Too strong and weird to my nostrils, I don't like vetiver I've realised. Vetiver triggers nausea. However, Sandalwood can be identified here. The body mists from FE are quite strong and have great longevity, though none works for me.
7. ***Rose Talcum and Mashobra Honey and Vanilla Talcum :*** Both are quite pretty talcums, those who like rose will love this rose and those who like vanilla will love the there one.

**CHANEL :**

1. ***Chance Eau Vive EDT*** : It is a combination of some lovely florals, Iris and musks, but inspite of having sensitive nose, I do not pick anything from this. Also there is something bitter, so a No for me.
2. ***Misia EDP*** : I wont go into the notes, but this is straight up Lipstick with waxy feels.
3. ***No 22 EDP*** : Quite aldehydic with some lovely notes, but ylang ylang and Vetiver start showing towards the dry down and it doesn't work for me.
4. ***No 5 l'eau*** : As the name suggests watered down version of the OG Chanel no 5, this one is nice, may be collection worthy, but I tried it one day on an outing and it didn't wow me the way it did during some me time, will I buy a FB or a decant, nah...however this is better than a lot of Chanels
5. ***Coco Mademoiselle eau vive EDT*** : I forgot how coco mademoiselle smells but the it was the first chanel I tried due to the hype and I did not like that at all. I have no idea if there are similarities between this and CM, but I'm not a fan of lychee. Not for me
6. ***Eau Fraiche*** : I liked it when I tried it at the store, but after sampling and trying it for the first time, I would say this is a great one from Chanel for summers, very fresh, if you are ohk with the incense-y ness it emits. Personally a No for me as I do not enjoy incense-y-ness, it destroyed so many good fragrances for me, to name a few-> Valaya, DelinaX, Chanel Coromandel, PDM Palatine
7. ***Paris- Riveria*** : This has a combination of citrus fruits and white florals which is too sharp in the beginning, would be a better option for male folk.
8. ***Gabrielle*** : The SA was a hesitant to show me this due to sensitive nose issue and my choices, but I would consider buying this in future, it is beautiful white floral fragrance, slightly bubbly due to citruses, better than Gabrielle sensual imo. Apt as an occasion wear and otherwise too.
9. ***1957*** : It is sophisticated musky fragrances, Some magic starts happening may be due to iris or the overall blending which is very ladylike. Vanilla is shown in the base notes, but I do not get any vanilla. I have small 4ml (how cute are these minis) and would be testing it for some time, still not confident to go for FB, as I find there something lil, very lil sharpness due to overload of musks. Also, the price is astronomical and is expected to go up this year.
10. ***Paris-Paris*** : This was love at first sniff. Combination of Damask rose and patchouli. Patchouli is faint here. I went for FB, but at times I find it a bit sharp. Similar to la colle noir from Dior. Also worth exploring is lotion by the same name.
11. ***Paris- Vensie :*** My most fav fragrance, citrus in the beginning and the vanilla here is so soft, the only vanilla I liked or I think I could ever like and tolerate. also there is rose and hints of faint iris. I'm glad I found this one. Signature scent worthy. Only con: vanishes too fast, but the trick lies in it being matured and using it on clothes. The only one I would buy again. Note : This doesn't project at all. similar to Dior amour by Dior.
12. ***No 19 Poudre and La Pausa :*** Keeping these two together as they have a common note, a green note. Looking at the notes, gree+iris+ jasmine, I thought this will be a holy grail for me, but the green note is something else, I had experienced galbanum as well as neroli and I like them both, but here it is something different, these two triggered nausea to such an extent, I had multiple episodes of vomiting and that too in peak Delhi traffic, that too at peak afternoon, that too at Barapulla flyover, that too when I was all alone, I couldn't even stop the damn vehicle & run anywhere, thank god there was a big tin dabba in car, only I know how I reached back home. I never thought I would get nauseated due to a fragrance, but....

NOTE : Few others worth exploring from Chanel are = Coco EDT, even Coco is nice, I prefer EDT over EDP. Coromandel (My eyes burn from this due to frankincense, otherwise beautiful), Boy, Gardenia( I personally do not enjoy tuberose, and prefer Jasmin over tuberose always, otherwise great blending), Comete ( I wanted to love it, but cherry blossom at the top didn't work for me), Paris-Edimbourg over Paris-Deauville & Paris-Biarritz.

**ARTISAN DIXIT/ PERITO MORENO :**

1. ***Meditation Mist:*** I like this in comparison to others, to me it is a combination of cinnamon, cloves and vanilla. Surprisingly, on skin cloves vanish and what remains is warm cinnamon and vanilla. Good for winters. I see a lot similarity to Diptyque's 34St Boulevard.
2. ***Culture*** : It has been praised by many in the sub here. Smooth rose, jasmine and sandalwood.
3. ***Citrus and Yuzu*** : Zesty and sweet. It is fresh, yet heavy.
4. ***Regal Silhouette*** : Too much paan feels in the beginning, personally I do not enjoy mint, it goes away in few minutes , there is something similar to Thumri, which is heavier and has more character than RS. Thumri is apt for someone who is experimental and love attending Indian Classical concerts.
5. ***King's Empire*** : Sandalwood and Cedar combo, nice but doesn't wow me. I tried a lot but it confuses me and I don't get much from this. Again imo this is dupe of the OG Tam Dao from Diptyque, still wondering why no one here has been able to see this.
6. **Not Dark Yet** : Much more sophisticated and statement worthy when compared to King's empire. Comparing because there are similarities between these two. never like gourmand frags, but this one is yummy and alluring, I do not care a bit its meant for men, definitely getting at least 10ml as this would be enough for me. Also this has chocolate note somewhere in the base, may be that is what is making it yummy. I usually stay away from gourmands frag as my hunger vanishes and I cannot eat anything after that, but that problem doesn't occur here. I get sandalwood, cinnamon and nutmeg from it. I stay away from cardamon in perfumes, but the blending here is great.
7. ***Nightingale*** : This is from Dixit and Zak, what an incredible fragrance, I wish I could get my hands on their sandalwood ones and some others too. I only have a 2ml sample of this, this one has ""chameli oil"" vibes but so nostalgic. Not feminine imo. Earlier I thought of keeping it for my partner, but not now, somethings are meant to kept for the memory sake only. It reminds my childhood in the mountains and all Sundays when my father would take me to barbershop with him to get the damn boycut hair. I wish I could draw all the scenes that it reminds me of when I sniff it. Whenever I smell it, I feel safe, as if nothing wrong could ever happen because my father and all my uncles are all here. Reminds me of all childhood memories when I would sit on his shoulder on long hikes in the mountains and I thought my father is a superhero which he still is , touchwood ❤️😇. Thank you guys Dixit and Zak for this one.

*NOTE* : Almost all Perito Moreno frag are male oriented, still they can be pulled off by ladies as well, some that I would recommend are Culture, meditation mist and Not dark yet. If someone here can send Nitish Dixit a request, kindly ask him to make something targeted towards females as well, he was onto something called Queen's empire but it never came out.

**SANTA MARIA NOUVELLA** :

1. ***L'iris:*** Iris with initial burst of Neroli, white florals, jasmine here is too pretty, a lit spicy, subtle bitterness is there but absolute hit for me as it reminds me something that made me a frag lover. Must have for those who prefer Iris. Iris is raw here, not your pretty woman soft iris.
2. ***Melograno*** : Fresh out of shower frag with slight powderyness, my first experience with a pomegranate note and I'm enjoying it.
3. ***Rosa Nouvella***: Fresh spicy rose, much better than a lot of roses in the market. But the vetiver in the base makes it a little non-feminine and this comes out as a surprise in the drydwon. Still much better rose than a lot roses in the market.
4. ***Rosa Gardenia*** : Rose is pretty but the fig blending is so tasteless, a fail. Not that I do not enjoy fig, diptyque Philosykis is a great take on fig, so fresh and juicy.
5. ***Pot Pourri*** : A mix of spices as the name suggests, camphoroous with cloves. Similar to the what our mother's would give us when we catch cold. A complete no for me as it reminds me fever.
6. ***Bizzaria*** : Do not like how Davana has been used here with florals. Davana is a wonderful note only if used properly, I will talk about a great Davana based formulation at the end of this entire write up.
7. ***Magnolia*** : A magnolia based fragrance with rose and green-ness. Overall pretty but something is there which triggers nausea so a no for me. Melograno is better than Magnolia imo.
8. ***Gelsomino*** : This is a jasmine fragrance, nice, much better than a lot where tuberose is added in heavy amounts and the delicate jasmine gets lost. It is green, there is some bitterness as well, plus it vanishes, no projection, no sillage. A no for me. Imo Diptyque's Olene is better than Gelsomino.
9. ***Tobacco Tuscana*** : I stay far away from tobacco note, but what a great combo of Tobacco with Vanilla.
10. ***Fressia :*** A freesia and rose. It is nice fragrance, violet makes it pretty , but there is something in it which make me sick and triggers nausea. Complete No.

NOTE : Worth Exploring imo are = L'iris, Melograno, Rosa Nouvella, Tobacco Tuscana. Rest which are hyped i.e Angel De Firenze and Aqua Della Regina did not work for me.

**LILANUR :**

1. ***Malli Insolite*** : A combination of Jasmin sambac, Jasmin gradiflorum, tuberose, pink pepper and mineral notes . This is realistic blooming mogras, but slight metallic-ness creeps in after some time.
2. ***Rajni Nocturne*** : I'will be frank, it's a combination of tuberose and jasmine and ylang ylang and one of the worst fragrances I ever tried, so bitter and off putting, or may be it is clear I do not like tuberose. I like something in it, but then it gets too bitter. For those who like tuberose much better options are love tuberose by Amouage, Jasmin des Anges, jasmine rouge from tom ford which is tuberose bomb imo. Also, their Tuberose Absolute attar is a realistic tuberose, doesn't get too ahead and turn bitter, sad part it remains flat and one has to bury their nose to even smell it.
3. ***Vetiver Monsoon*** : Initial burst is so earthy with hints of jasmine, too pretty and satisfying just like the first rain of monsoon season, but after that there is bitterness through and through.
4. ***Davana Cedre*** : What a creation, kudos to the perfumer ! It is not a fragrance with any fragrance as such but such an interesting formulation. This is straight up ""Chilam"" if any of you here understands what a chilam is, it is similar to ""Hooka"" but one used by females in northern India I guess. So earthy with some smokiness, induces craving for Gili mitti. This might not be similar to a Bar's Hookah, but very earthy, I have no idea what a hookah at bar smells or tastes like, but clearly know what is smell of a hookah and chilam as my both my grandfather and grandmother used them often.
5. ***Incarnation :*** What a Chypre bomb, but beware as the orris/labdanum here can be too much and headache inducing near the dry down. Gorgeous jasmine, rose, orris. I wish they did not add labdanum here, this would have been such a hit. Temple vibes with dressed up ladies flocking here and there.
6. ***Agar Epice***: Oud and Sandalwood combo is what I get. Oud is soft here and blends with other notes with much ease. I stay away from even trying oud as it is either too sweet or turns animalic. AE triggers some nostalgia of a lost memory which is so hard for me to explain or find. I've always loved finding secrets and my head is solving mysteries half of the time, and not able to find a lost memory while feeling longing and pain is so disturbing, my fragrance journey if not ends, changes after this experience. Will stay far far away from any oud and sandalwood combo, as I literally turn into Karan and Arjun from Karan Arjun movie lol.
7. ***Gul Rouge***: Combo of Rose Centifolia, Damascus rose and honey. Nice rose fragrance, watery rose, not light but very heavy. I will say Gulnar from FE is much better than this one imo. Only good part is when that Damascus rose starts shining before the dry down or after 2 hours which is like magic, however I do not when the dry down happens as it remains on clothes more than 24 hours. One spray is enough, otherwise cloying.
8. ***Zafran Boise***: I wanted to gatekeep this fragrance, yes :P, not because I do not like sharing, but I fear it might be a small stock. Plus it is not available online, I'll not even know if that is the last bottle and I should jump ahead and get it lol. This is the most beautiful fragrance I ever sniffed, sadly it cannot be pulled off as unisex and is meant for men only, otherwise I would have bought it the first time I tried it at store, also it was not even a part of discovery set. It has opening of saffron and dried rose and some faint spices, just tooo beautiful, but after 20 mins, it had woody notes coming out, still nice, but by the next morning, my hand turned into a man's arm. So this is meant for men only imo. I just hope this doesn't go out of stock.

NOTE : All fragrances from Lilanur are interesting, but none too alluring to spend around that much amount, I wish they launched at least 3.5 ml samples and did a little extra marketing here in India. However, all are quite potent 1-2 sprays are enough.

**SOME RANDOM SAMPLES:**

1. ***Olene EDT from Diptyque*** : Subtle photorealistic jasmine with green hints, not pretty but just real jasmine bush. Light and fresh. Highly recommend. It's an EDT so kindly try on clothes for longevity.
2. ***BR 540 MFK :*** By now most of folks know the note profile, A complete No for me. Medicinal feels with overdose of sweetness. As many know by now, Zara's red temptation is nearly perfect dupe of it.
3. ***Amouage Lilac Love*** : Nice, but heavy. I get jasmine, roses,lilac and lot other florals. Worth sampling but no FB worthy. I like the whiffs I get from it. Also how lovely are these sample boxes from Amougae, also these samples come with cap, so no issue of leakage, I might get only 2 more samples of this for the sake of lilac.
4. ***Amougae Love Tuberose*** : Great take on tuberose. Recommend for tuberose seekers. Creamy tuberose imo.
5. ***VS Bare Rose*** : Synthetic metallic rose, my 2.5k wasted in a miniature from nyka. Not reccommnded at all.
6. ***Valaya:*** Super pretty citrusy, but that ambroxan destroyed it for me, I felt so pretty, uplifted mood and what not wearing this, but that incense-y-ness ohh no no. I wonder if I'll ever find a summer fresh frag. Need recommendations ? as I do not own a single freshy
7. ***Dama Bianca*** ***Xerjoff :*** As mentioned by many influencers I do not find it pretty or fluffy, it is heavy on vanilla. Not recommended. Also I get something medicinal from this. May be that is where the western taste differs from ours. Too gourmand-ish. I had to scrub it off the first and the only time I tried it.
8. ***Eau Duelle EDT From Diptyque*** : What a great take on Vanilla, it is a fresh vanilla as if kept in the kitchen of a wooden cottage somewhere in a dark green wet forest. Highly recommend for vanilla seekers.
9. ***Fluer de peau by Diptyque***: Cold but pretty and aloof iris. Not blind buy worthy at all, but worth sampling. Not recommended for winters. Powdery but cold like a whisper.
10. ***La Violette Annick Goutal*** : After searching on the net and as per the notes, I got a tester bottle of this one after trying it at the MDP store, I do not think it performs that well, a lil cold and sharp this one is. It is a combination of Violet, violet leaf and rose. There is something too alluring around during drown but overall doesn't work for me.
11. ***Rose Pompom EDP by Annick Goutal*** : Eww just too sweet and sour this is. A bomb of sweetness and sourness. Seeing the damask rose I sampled it, also may be I tried EDT version and really loved the rose in it and ordered EDP, but it doesn't work. EDP also has raspberry as the top note so may be that is at play here.
12. ***Taif Rose, Jasmin de pays, Rose de Mai from PMC*** : There is some note common note in all there of these fragrances which is too off putting, A total no for me. I thought there is something wrong with me so I asked few strangers at the MDP store to try sniffing the blotter and they all disliked it. Not even worth sampling imo, if you go to the MDP store, try it there.
13. **I*****ris Fauve by Atelier des ors*** : A heavy and sweet cinnamon-y Iris, it is sweet but would be perfect for extreme winters. There is something in the dry down which is too beautiful to be put into words. But this is suited for extreme winters only, otherwise it can be too cloying. Worth trying.
14. ***Rose Omeyyade Atelier des ors*** : Much better rose in comparison to many others. I guess it is damask rose at play here. There is oud and sandalwood in the base. A good one as a winter occasion wear, much better than velvet rose and oud from Jo Malone.
15. ***Jasmin Sambac and Marigold from Jo Malone:*** It was recommended by many here as a Jasmin forward fragrance, but this one did not work for me at all, as it getter bitter may be due to ylang ylang.
16. ***Silver Birch and Lavender by Jo Malone*** : I personally loed it on the blotter so far, I have not tried on skin yet. It is a combination of lavender and woody notes, worth exploring for purple flower seekers.
17. ***Boise Corse by Diptyque:*** It has coffee as a hero note here, slightly sweet coffee with Tonka beans and sandalwood, worth exploring for those looking for a coffee based perfume.
18. ***Rose Roche by Diptyque:*** Nice lime and rose combo, does get a lil bitter, the bitterness is not something extra but is coming from the natural character of lime. Gives dessert-y feels, worth exploring but wouldn't recommend blind buying as it is from their private collection and prices are off the charts. I see someone mentioned it is similar to Paris, it is not, while rose Roche has desert vibes, Paris Paris from chanel is far away from that and is a bit feminine.
19. ***Lilyphea by Diptque:*** Only perfume with an ozonic note that I could tolerate without nausea getting triggered. Definitely worth exploring. Very pretty and fresh in the top notes. Projection and longevity might be an issue here. Do give it a try if you are at a Diptyque store.
20. ***Joy EDP by Jean Patou***: This is praised so much by many frag critics, combo of jasmine, tuberose, rose with ylang ylang. I sense something groundbreaking in the background but what comes in the front something tooo sharp, either the miniature I have has gone bad or may be it doesn't work for me. Stays beyond 2 days for me and projects.
21. ***Eau Rose by Diptyque EDP*** : A beautiful realistic rose, little feminine. Gets sweeter in the middle notes. Highly recommend this rose. Even the EDT is nice. I wish there was a hybrid of EDP top notes and EDT top notes, nevertheless both of these are nice.
22. ***Do Son by Diptyque:*** Great take on tuberose, fresh and uplifting. Worth sampling for those who love tuberose.
23. ***Philosykos EDT by Diptyque***: Fruity, what a great take on fig note. I totally abhor when fig is blended with some other notes and thought I hate fig, but here it is alone on its own and this is so fruity and fresh and green as if you have landed in a heavenly orchard.

STORY BEHIND TURNING INTO A FRAG HEAD :

The first time I fell in love with fragrance was because of my newly married aunt. I was so mesmerised as a barely 6 year old girl, I would beg her to give me her handkerchief, to this day I remember that mustard handkerchief. I almost forgot my love for ""khushboo"" while growing up as my mother too has a sensitive nose and skin and stayed away from cosmetics as much as she could. But my love for a beautiful scent was always well known in my family. Even as a school girl back in early 2000s I would take a little 30 ml local perfume with an American flag in my school bag lol ( in case anyone knows or remembers please let me know its name). I was badly shamed for bringing perfume to school, it was such a haww moment. Then life took over, I would use whatever my cousins got, then my first job perfume was Oriflame muse, so pretty it was. I tried few here and there while visiting malls, but was never determined to get a new one. Got few attars and was ohk as I got so busy in the later half of my 20s running after goals, I almost forget to take care of myself, just followed physical training, as if those years were completely lost, whoosh in a second.

Then after many years I was in Agra and Vrindavan and got some flowers for festival decor. Got bunches of Roses and Mogras and let me tell you Roses grown around Greater Noida, Aligarh and nearby patch of land is so so beautiful and smells di-vine and majorly used in most of the temples of Vrindavan. I had these flowers in my room, the moment I entered back after some time, I got whiff of the most heavenly and divinely beautiful fragrance. This was not the first time I was sniffing flowers, growing up in the far away mountains of Uttarakhand , I had experienced all kinds of flowers in garden, met some saints in small cottages who were gifted Swiss rose by one of their European disciple, and we had it in the garden for many years, these roses would grown in bunches rather than individual flowers, my mother would often make rose water and delicacies. Sadly, these flowers didn't bloom at all in the plains weather. Also I had close relation to mogras as a classical dance practitioner, mogras are always around , either in dance class or in home decor, in gajras. Cut to present, what I experienced that day in room with those flowers mesmerised me once again.

I guess it was nearly this time I had this bizarre dream, where I'm a bride but in a Nikkah setting, despite of I me being a Hindu. As strange as it was and not getting into the details, what I could sense is the fragrance, I felt so beautiful, and the fragrance on me was so Godamn beautiful, that fragrance, search for that fragrance had me running here and there since almost a year, the way a Musk deer runs here and there to look for fragrance, the same way I was on a hunt to find that fragrance. I have not been able to find that fragrance but I'm glad I could smell something in Liris which is akin to my newly married aunt's handkerchief and hence my soul is somewhat satisfied to at least find something if not ""the thing"".

Cut to next, I tried Agar Epice from Lilanur and I almost had an entire post about this, trying to cut the story short, this one took me into some sort of spirals down the memory lane which is hazy and confusing. It reminded me Azans from Mosque, some place with neem trees, water body and sunset with oarge painted skies. I always had a liking for azans and sunsets, not that I was crazy but it is such a soul food for me, also I'm a die hard of NFAK music, much before this generation fell for it. I had many dreams in the past 2-3 years where I'm constantly in a muslim setting since the nikkah dream, then I get some other dream after almost 1.5 year where I'm travelling and I meet someone in a cave sort of tunnel and all of a sudden an old man with long beard does some magic with pink coloured sand & it turned into some ""w"" symbol kept on a green velvet cloth, and he asks me bow down to it, after few days I randomly start googling this ""W and a sword beside it"" symbol and come to know it is the name of Allah and that is how it is written, this freaked the shit out of me.

Cut to next, after 7-8 months I meet a guy for an arrange marriage setting and this was the first time I was meeting someone in such a setting , and the very same night I see a dream where I'm in an old blue coloured home in a village, and seeing off the guy and his family, and suddenly two big goats start running after me and we had a bizarre eye contact, one of the goat and me, creepy enough. Then all of us start entering a dargarh and the guy who came meet me introduces himself to the guys at the entrance as my shauhar, I mean What !!! Then all of sudden all people move ahead and I'm left alone, in some slippery place within dargah and fall down, and, I ask folks to help me get up, but they start saying Tauba and something else too, and don not help me at all. I feel so weak and I'm not able to get up, I wake up out of dream in the morning .

Overall freaky, and this combo of oud and sandalwood in agar Epice triggered nostalgia, and I want to sniff it again and again and almost crave something which even I have no idea of. Strangely I tried remembering details of the nikkah dream because this bloody mind is curious, I remember myself on terrace being a bride, a long veil, a woman in burkha siting beside me on a daybed sort of a thing on terrace, its about to get dark, and I could see a guy, I never focused on the guy as I was running behind ""the frag"", but this Agar Epice meddles with my mind in such a way, now I'm trying to track details of a dream I saw almost 3 years back, so the guy is shaking hands with some 2-3 men when he reaches terrace via a staircase, I could see his eyes for a second maybe, its not an eye contact as I have this long veil on, so I could see him but I think he couldn't see my face,I'm also not sure if he is the groom because he isn't dressed up like one but is wearing Kurta, strangely the guy has some similar vibes to the guy who was my first crush in school, but he is not the same person, his eyes, ""those eyes"". are different., the eyes are not even kind. What is frustrating is I'm trying to remember his face now almost after 3 years and I'm not able to remember and that is pissing me off, I do not want to go down this rabbit hole, but this mind plays tricks. Considering how sensitive religious topics are, this is not meant to hurt anyone's sentiments, there was no other way I could have shared my story without getting into the details.

What is little strange which I almost forgot and thought my mind is playing tricks, is that my mother was helped immensely by a muslim neighbour, who was my father's manager's wife when my mom was expecting me, while she was in Baroda Gujrat far far away from her home town which is in NCR. The lady would often make breakfast for my mom, father and would take my elder sister to her home to feed her along with her kids. My fast pace intense frag journey ends here as I do not want to think much about all this anymore, now that I have thought so much about this entire thing , clearly this has gone to my conscious and subconscious and anything if ever happens again in my dream will be an outcome of all this as per my logic. Keeping safe distance from anything oud and sandalwood. Sadly I couldn't find that dream fragrance which was my pivotal point in this entire journey and something else hit me after testing Agar Epice, also I have now almost forgotten what that fragrances was after trying almost 200 fragrances in an years span. And let me say it looks all made up until it hits you one day. Many fragrances have not been mentioned here as I do not find them appealing and they have been mentioned by someone somewhere here in the sub, pushing those breaks on this journey after eating SA's head in every other store I visited.

I have boycotted most fast food places and most restaurants, I'll eat them IF i have to, like if they are the only places to eat in the middle of nowhere, but that's it. I'm sorry but i'm not going to starve myself.

It's actually helped me save money tbh. I used to like Starbucks tbh but have stopped buying coffee from them. Why spend 6 dollars USD for ONE cup of coffee, when you can spend around 12 dollars to buy a big thing of coffee grounds, milk, sugar, and creamer, that will last you a lot longer?

I also stopped buying from Walmart. I mostly bought clothes there but I have a Ross. I would rather pay a little bit more than buy from Walmart.

I kinda stopped buying from amazon but sadly i can't altogether. As a pc owner, there isn't to many options to choose from. Can't go to a local store and buy RTX 4070 ti super. Would be awesome but not going to happen XD. So i have to buy from Amazon, but only once every couple to few years, or until nvidia stops supporting my card. But other from that, Amazon won't see me as a customer anymore.

**ATTARS :**

1. ***Mysore Sandal by ML Ramnarain*** : Good quality sandalwood attar, quite potent, I personally do not like it on skin as top and mid journey is fine, but by the dry down there is something which is too much for me to handle, something sour, sharp and heavy. Decided to keep it for diffusers and rituals. Once added 2 drops to Hawan Kund and the entire house literally got lifted up to some different realm for a few minutes. Somehow will try to learn to use it on skin as well.
2. ***Jasmine Attar from local shop in Munnar, Kerala selling tea as well :*** Got this way back in 2017 , love it due to nostalgic reasons, reminds me of Kerala and Malayalam cinema. It is an indolic one with subtle sweetness as well as well as it is gender fluid. If you are travelling to Munnar do explore a big tea shop in Munnar, they have variety of attars. They sell cakes, tea as well attars I guess.
3. ***Attar Khalisi from Zamindar Kesar King :*** My sister got this from her Kashmir trip many years ago, it's almost 10 years old now. Soapy in beginning but after it settles, it is very soothing and calming saffron sightly sweet as well, I thought I will never like saffron as a frag note,but... saffron is absolute love for me now.
4. ***Shrungar by Perito Moreno:*** It has jasmine and rose and many other ingredients, there is this mint which doesn't work for me or I have not learnt to use it yet, I also see prices increasing for this while being on sale. I would recommend Culture Perfume for similar notes.

**FOREST ESSENTIAL :**

1. ***Gulnar Intese Perfume***: My most favourite rose, it is a combination of rose and carnation with desi vibes, a lil sweet. projection on clothes is beyond 36 hours for me, I have a sensitive nose. Few other rose fav are = Eau Rose by Diptyque + la colle noire by Dior. I thought I liked Delinas but I'm not vibing with those again. For those who like rose, Gulnar is a must have, do yourself a favour and get the 10ml travel size. I'm yet to try MFK a la rose + few most loved from Fredreic Malle, so my review is coming from this angle as well, sharing this info as it will help readers understand and make better decision. I tried Scherzo from Miller Harris which is loved by many, but the dry down too sweet for me, same is with Mancera Rose Vanille, too sweet.
2. ***Chandani Ratein Perfume :*** Jasmine based fragrance. I liked it when I tried it for the first time, but IMO it is not worth it at all, moreover I get synthetic feels from it, also it causes dry coughing and I find it causes allergy, I have healthy lungs so the issue is not with me but this formulation. Not meant to offend those who like for variety of reasons, but there are much better options out there, and many good attars as well. FE Amrita is another better option while exploring FE frags.
3. ***Mallika Intense Perfume***: One more rat ki rani based, I think it is not available anymore, they launched it last year. Good that they discontinued it, it was worst white floral I tried similar to Jasmin Sensual from Oriflame, which was another bad formulation and straight up nail polish remover.
4. ***FE Jasmine and Mogra mist and Oil*** : Very pretty jasmine, the mist is a bit alcoholic, but the oil is lovely, very pretty and soothing vibes, even the lotion is nice. I guess this range is not available anymore now.
5. ***Nargis Body Mist*** : It is nargis based mist, but too strong for my nose, I have only used this for spraying in and around my washroom. Other nargis based from FE is Amrita which is a pretty formulation, second best from FE after Gulnar.
6. ***Sandalwood and Vetiver :*** Too strong and weird to my nostrils, I don't like vetiver I've realised. Vetiver triggers nausea. However, Sandalwood can be identified here. The body mists from FE are quite strong and have great longevity, though none works for me.
7. ***Rose Talcum and Mashobra Honey and Vanilla Talcum :*** Both are quite pretty talcums, those who like rose will love this rose and those who like vanilla will love the there one.

**CHANEL :**

1. ***Chance Eau Vive EDT*** : It is a combination of some lovely florals, Iris and musks, but inspite of having sensitive nose, I do not pick anything from this. Also there is something bitter, so a No for me.
2. ***Misia EDP*** : I wont go into the notes, but this is straight up Lipstick with waxy feels.
3. ***No 22 EDP*** : Quite aldehydic with some lovely notes, but ylang ylang and Vetiver start showing towards the dry down and it doesn't work for me.
4. ***No 5 l'eau*** : As the name suggests watered down version of the OG Chanel no 5, this one is nice, may be collection worthy, but I tried it one day on an outing and it didn't wow me the way it did during some me time, will I buy a FB or a decant, nah...however this is better than a lot of Chanels
5. ***Coco Mademoiselle eau vive EDT*** : I forgot how coco mademoiselle smells but the it was the first chanel I tried due to the hype and I did not like that at all. I have no idea if there are similarities between this and CM, but I'm not a fan of lychee. Not for me
6. ***Eau Fraiche*** : I liked it when I tried it at the store, but after sampling and trying it for the first time, I would say this is a great one from Chanel for summers, very fresh, if you are ohk with the incense-y ness it emits. Personally a No for me as I do not enjoy incense-y-ness, it destroyed so many good fragrances for me, to name a few-> Valaya, DelinaX, Chanel Coromandel, PDM Palatine
7. ***Paris- Riveria*** : This has a combination of citrus fruits and white florals which is too sharp in the beginning, would be a better option for male folk.
8. ***Gabrielle*** : The SA was a hesitant to show me this due to sensitive nose issue and my choices, but I would consider buying this in future, it is beautiful white floral fragrance, slightly bubbly due to citruses, better than Gabrielle sensual imo. Apt as an occasion wear and otherwise too.
9. ***1957*** : It is sophisticated musky fragrances, Some magic starts happening may be due to iris or the overall blending which is very ladylike. Vanilla is shown in the base notes, but I do not get any vanilla. I have small 4ml (how cute are these minis) and would be testing it for some time, still not confident to go for FB, as I find there something lil, very lil sharpness due to overload of musks. Also, the price is astronomical and is expected to go up this year.
10. ***Paris-Paris*** : This was love at first sniff. Combination of Damask rose and patchouli. Patchouli is faint here. I went for FB, but at times I find it a bit sharp. Similar to la colle noir from Dior. Also worth exploring is lotion by the same name.
11. ***Paris- Vensie :*** My most fav fragrance, citrus in the beginning and the vanilla here is so soft, the only vanilla I liked or I think I could ever like and tolerate. also there is rose and hints of faint iris. I'm glad I found this one. Signature scent worthy. Only con: vanishes too fast, but the trick lies in it being matured and using it on clothes. The only one I would buy again. Note : This doesn't project at all. similar to Dior amour by Dior.
12. ***No 19 Poudre and La Pausa :*** Keeping these two together as they have a common note, a green note. Looking at the notes, gree+iris+ jasmine, I thought this will be a holy grail for me, but the green note is something else, I had experienced galbanum as well as neroli and I like them both, but here it is something different, these two triggered nausea to such an extent, I had multiple episodes of vomiting and that too in peak Delhi traffic, that too at peak afternoon, that too at Barapulla flyover, that too when I was all alone, I couldn't even stop the damn vehicle & run anywhere, thank god there was a big tin dabba in car, only I know how I reached back home. I never thought I would get nauseated due to a fragrance, but....

NOTE : Few others worth exploring from Chanel are = Coco EDT, even Coco is nice, I prefer EDT over EDP. Coromandel (My eyes burn from this due to frankincense, otherwise beautiful), Boy, Gardenia( I personally do not enjoy tuberose, and prefer Jasmin over tuberose always, otherwise great blending), Comete ( I wanted to love it, but cherry blossom at the top didn't work for me), Paris-Edimbourg over Paris-Deauville & Paris-Biarritz.

**ARTISAN DIXIT/ PERITO MORENO :**

1. ***Meditation Mist:*** I like this in comparison to others, to me it is a combination of cinnamon, cloves and vanilla. Surprisingly, on skin cloves vanish and what remains is warm cinnamon and vanilla. Good for winters. I see a lot similarity to Diptyque's 34St Boulevard.
2. ***Culture*** : It has been praised by many in the sub here. Smooth rose, jasmine and sandalwood.
3. ***Citrus and Yuzu*** : Zesty and sweet. It is fresh, yet heavy.
4. ***Regal Silhouette*** : Too much paan feels in the beginning, personally I do not enjoy mint, it goes away in few minutes , there is something similar to Thumri, which is heavier and has more character than RS. Thumri is apt for someone who is experimental and love attending Indian Classical concerts.
5. ***King's Empire*** : Sandalwood and Cedar combo, nice but doesn't wow me. I tried a lot but it confuses me and I don't get much from this. Again imo this is dupe of the OG Tam Dao from Diptyque, still wondering why no one here has been able to see this.
6. **Not Dark Yet** : Much more sophisticated and statement worthy when compared to King's empire. Comparing because there are similarities between these two. never like gourmand frags, but this one is yummy and alluring, I do not care a bit its meant for men, definitely getting at least 10ml as this would be enough for me. Also this has chocolate note somewhere in the base, may be that is what is making it yummy. I usually stay away from gourmands frag as my hunger vanishes and I cannot eat anything after that, but that problem doesn't occur here. I get sandalwood, cinnamon and nutmeg from it. I stay away from cardamon in perfumes, but the blending here is great.
7. ***Nightingale*** : This is from Dixit and Zak, what an incredible fragrance, I wish I could get my hands on their sandalwood ones and some others too. I only have a 2ml sample of this, this one has ""chameli oil"" vibes but so nostalgic. Not feminine imo. Earlier I thought of keeping it for my partner, but not now, somethings are meant to kept for the memory sake only. It reminds my childhood in the mountains and all Sundays when my father would take me to barbershop with him to get the damn boycut hair. I wish I could draw all the scenes that it reminds me of when I sniff it. Whenever I smell it, I feel safe, as if nothing wrong could ever happen because my father and all my uncles are all here. Reminds me of all childhood memories when I would sit on his shoulder on long hikes in the mountains and I thought my father is a superhero which he still is , touchwood ❤️😇. Thank you guys Dixit and Zak for this one.

*NOTE* : Almost all Perito Moreno frag are male oriented, still they can be pulled off by ladies as well, some that I would recommend are Culture, meditation mist and Not dark yet. If someone here can send Nitish Dixit a request, kindly ask him to make something targeted towards females as well, he was onto something called Queen's empire but it never came out.

**SANTA MARIA NOUVELLA** :

1. ***L'iris:*** Iris with initial burst of Neroli, white florals, jasmine here is too pretty, a lit spicy, subtle bitterness is there but absolute hit for me as it reminds me something that made me a frag lover. Must have for those who prefer Iris. Iris is raw here, not your pretty woman soft iris.
2. ***Melograno*** : Fresh out of shower frag with slight powderyness, my first experience with a pomegranate note and I'm enjoying it.
3. ***Rosa Nouvella***: Fresh spicy rose, much better than a lot of roses in the market. But the vetiver in the base makes it a little non-feminine and this comes out as a surprise in the drydwon. Still much better rose than a lot roses in the market.
4. ***Rosa Gardenia*** : Rose is pretty but the fig blending is so tasteless, a fail. Not that I do not enjoy fig, diptyque Philosykis is a great take on fig, so fresh and juicy.
5. ***Pot Pourri*** : A mix of spices as the name suggests, camphoroous with cloves. Similar to the what our mother's would give us when we catch cold. A complete no for me as it reminds me fever.
6. ***Bizzaria*** : Do not like how Davana has been used here with florals. Davana is a wonderful note only if used properly, I will talk about a great Davana based formulation at the end of this entire write up.
7. ***Magnolia*** : A magnolia based fragrance with rose and green-ness. Overall pretty but something is there which triggers nausea so a no for me. Melograno is better than Magnolia imo.
8. ***Gelsomino*** : This is a jasmine fragrance, nice, much better than a lot where tuberose is added in heavy amounts and the delicate jasmine gets lost. It is green, there is some bitterness as well, plus it vanishes, no projection, no sillage. A no for me. Imo Diptyque's Olene is better than Gelsomino.
9. ***Tobacco Tuscana*** : I stay far away from tobacco note, but what a great combo of Tobacco with Vanilla.
10. ***Fressia :*** A freesia and rose. It is nice fragrance, violet makes it pretty , but there is something in it which make me sick and triggers nausea. Complete No.

NOTE : Worth Exploring imo are = L'iris, Melograno, Rosa Nouvella, Tobacco Tuscana. Rest which are hyped i.e Angel De Firenze and Aqua Della Regina did not work for me.

**LILANUR :**

1. ***Malli Insolite*** : A combination of Jasmin sambac, Jasmin gradiflorum, tuberose, pink pepper and mineral notes . This is realistic blooming mogras, but slight metallic-ness creeps in after some time.
2. ***Rajni Nocturne*** : I'will be frank, it's a combination of tuberose and jasmine and ylang ylang and one of the worst fragrances I ever tried, so bitter and off putting, or may be it is clear I do not like tuberose. I like something in it, but then it gets too bitter. For those who like tuberose much better options are love tuberose by Amouage, Jasmin des Anges, jasmine rouge from tom ford which is tuberose bomb imo. Also, their Tuberose Absolute attar is a realistic tuberose, doesn't get too ahead and turn bitter, sad part it remains flat and one has to bury their nose to even smell it.
3. ***Vetiver Monsoon*** : Initial burst is so earthy with hints of jasmine, too pretty and satisfying just like the first rain of monsoon season, but after that there is bitterness through and through.
4. ***Davana Cedre*** : What a creation, kudos to the perfumer ! It is not a fragrance with any fragrance as such but such an interesting formulation. This is straight up ""Chilam"" if any of you here understands what a chilam is, it is similar to ""Hooka"" but one used by females in northern India I guess. So earthy with some smokiness, induces craving for Gili mitti. This might not be similar to a Bar's Hookah, but very earthy, I have no idea what a hookah at bar smells or tastes like, but clearly know what is smell of a hookah and chilam as my both my grandfather and grandmother used them often.
5. ***Incarnation :*** What a Chypre bomb, but beware as the orris/labdanum here can be too much and headache inducing near the dry down. Gorgeous jasmine, rose, orris. I wish they did not add labdanum here, this would have been such a hit. Temple vibes with dressed up ladies flocking here and there.
6. ***Agar Epice***: Oud and Sandalwood combo is what I get. Oud is soft here and blends with other notes with much ease. I stay away from even trying oud as it is either too sweet or turns animalic. AE triggers some nostalgia of a lost memory which is so hard for me to explain or find. I've always loved finding secrets and my head is solving mysteries half of the time, and not able to find a lost memory while feeling longing and pain is so disturbing, my fragrance journey if not ends, changes after this experience. Will stay far far away from any oud and sandalwood combo, as I literally turn into Karan and Arjun from Karan Arjun movie lol.
7. ***Gul Rouge***: Combo of Rose Centifolia, Damascus rose and honey. Nice rose fragrance, watery rose, not light but very heavy. I will say Gulnar from FE is much better than this one imo. Only good part is when that Damascus rose starts shining before the dry down or after 2 hours which is like magic, however I do not when the dry down happens as it remains on clothes more than 24 hours. One spray is enough, otherwise cloying.
8. ***Zafran Boise***: I wanted to gatekeep this fragrance, yes :P, not because I do not like sharing, but I fear it might be a small stock. Plus it is not available online, I'll not even know if that is the last bottle and I should jump ahead and get it lol. This is the most beautiful fragrance I ever sniffed, sadly it cannot be pulled off as unisex and is meant for men only, otherwise I would have bought it the first time I tried it at store, also it was not even a part of discovery set. It has opening of saffron and dried rose and some faint spices, just tooo beautiful, but after 20 mins, it had woody notes coming out, still nice, but by the next morning, my hand turned into a man's arm. So this is meant for men only imo. I just hope this doesn't go out of stock.

NOTE : All fragrances from Lilanur are interesting, but none too alluring to spend around that much amount, I wish they launched at least 3.5 ml samples and did a little extra marketing here in India. However, all are quite potent 1-2 sprays are enough.

**SOME RANDOM SAMPLES:**

1. ***Olene EDT from Diptyque*** : Subtle photorealistic jasmine with green hints, not pretty but just real jasmine bush. Light and fresh. Highly recommend. It's an EDT so kindly try on clothes for longevity.
2. ***BR 540 MFK :*** By now most of folks know the note profile, A complete No for me. Medicinal feels with overdose of sweetness. As many know by now, Zara's red temptation is nearly perfect dupe of it.
3. ***Amouage Lilac Love*** : Nice, but heavy. I get jasmine, roses,lilac and lot other florals. Worth sampling but no FB worthy. I like the whiffs I get from it. Also how lovely are these sample boxes from Amougae, also these samples come with cap, so no issue of leakage, I might get only 2 more samples of this for the sake of lilac.
4. ***Amougae Love Tuberose*** : Great take on tuberose. Recommend for tuberose seekers. Creamy tuberose imo.
5. ***VS Bare Rose*** : Synthetic metallic rose, my 2.5k wasted in a miniature from nyka. Not reccommnded at all.
6. ***Valaya:*** Super pretty citrusy, but that ambroxan destroyed it for me, I felt so pretty, uplifted mood and what not wearing this, but that incense-y-ness ohh no no. I wonder if I'll ever find a summer fresh frag. Need recommendations ? as I do not own a single freshy
7. ***Dama Bianca*** ***Xerjoff :*** As mentioned by many influencers I do not find it pretty or fluffy, it is heavy on vanilla. Not recommended. Also I get something medicinal from this. May be that is where the western taste differs from ours. Too gourmand-ish. I had to scrub it off the first and the only time I tried it.
8. ***Eau Duelle EDT From Diptyque*** : What a great take on Vanilla, it is a fresh vanilla as if kept in the kitchen of a wooden cottage somewhere in a dark green wet forest. Highly recommend for vanilla seekers.
9. ***Fluer de peau by Diptyque***: Cold but pretty and aloof iris. Not blind buy worthy at all, but worth sampling. Not recommended for winters. Powdery but cold like a whisper.
10. ***La Violette Annick Goutal*** : After searching on the net and as per the notes, I got a tester bottle of this one after trying it at the MDP store, I do not think it performs that well, a lil cold and sharp this one is. It is a combination of Violet, violet leaf and rose. There is something too alluring around during drown but overall doesn't work for me.
11. ***Rose Pompom EDP by Annick Goutal*** : Eww just too sweet and sour this is. A bomb of sweetness and sourness. Seeing the damask rose I sampled it, also may be I tried EDT version and really loved the rose in it and ordered EDP, but it doesn't work. EDP also has raspberry as the top note so may be that is at play here.
12. ***Taif Rose, Jasmin de pays, Rose de Mai from PMC*** : There is some note common note in all there of these fragrances which is too off putting, A total no for me. I thought there is something wrong with me so I asked few strangers at the MDP store to try sniffing the blotter and they all disliked it. Not even worth sampling imo, if you go to the MDP store, try it there.
13. **I*****ris Fauve by Atelier des ors*** : A heavy and sweet cinnamon-y Iris, it is sweet but would be perfect for extreme winters. There is something in the dry down which is too beautiful to be put into words. But this is suited for extreme winters only, otherwise it can be too cloying. Worth trying.
14. ***Rose Omeyyade Atelier des ors*** : Much better rose in comparison to many others. I guess it is damask rose at play here. There is oud and sandalwood in the base. A good one as a winter occasion wear, much better than velvet rose and oud from Jo Malone.
15. ***Jasmin Sambac and Marigold from Jo Malone:*** It was recommended by many here as a Jasmin forward fragrance, but this one did not work for me at all, as it getter bitter may be due to ylang ylang.
16. ***Silver Birch and Lavender by Jo Malone*** : I personally loed it on the blotter so far, I have not tried on skin yet. It is a combination of lavender and woody notes, worth exploring for purple flower seekers.
17. ***Boise Corse by Diptyque:*** It has coffee as a hero note here, slightly sweet coffee with Tonka beans and sandalwood, worth exploring for those looking for a coffee based perfume.
18. ***Rose Roche by Diptyque:*** Nice lime and rose combo, does get a lil bitter, the bitterness is not something extra but is coming from the natural character of lime. Gives dessert-y feels, worth exploring but wouldn't recommend blind buying as it is from their private collection and prices are off the charts. I see someone mentioned it is similar to Paris, it is not, while rose Roche has desert vibes, Paris Paris from chanel is far away from that and is a bit feminine.
19. ***Lilyphea by Diptque:*** Only perfume with an ozonic note that I could tolerate without nausea getting triggered. Definitely worth exploring. Very pretty and fresh in the top notes. Projection and longevity might be an issue here. Do give it a try if you are at a Diptyque store.
20. ***Joy EDP by Jean Patou***: This is praised so much by many frag critics, combo of jasmine, tuberose, rose with ylang ylang. I sense something groundbreaking in the background but what comes in the front something tooo sharp, either the miniature I have has gone bad or may be it doesn't work for me. Stays beyond 2 days for me and projects.
21. ***Eau Rose by Diptyque EDP*** : A beautiful realistic rose, little feminine. Gets sweeter in the middle notes. Highly recommend this rose. Even the EDT is nice. I wish there was a hybrid of EDP top notes and EDT top notes, nevertheless both of these are nice.
22. ***Do Son by Diptyque:*** Great take on tuberose, fresh and uplifting. Worth sampling for those who love tuberose.
23. ***Philosykos EDT by Diptyque***: Fruity, what a great take on fig note. I totally abhor when fig is blended with some other notes and thought I hate fig, but here it is alone on its own and this is so fruity and fresh and green as if you have landed in a heavenly orchard.

STORY BEHIND TURNING INTO A FRAG HEAD :

The first time I fell in love with fragrance was because of my newly married aunt. I was so mesmerised as a barely 6 year old girl, I would beg her to give me her handkerchief, to this day I remember that mustard handkerchief. I almost forgot my love for ""khushboo"" while growing up as my mother too has a sensitive nose and skin and stayed away from cosmetics as much as she could. But my love for a beautiful scent was always well known in my family. Even as a school girl back in early 2000s I would take a little 30 ml local perfume with an American flag in my school bag lol ( in case anyone knows or remembers please let me know its name). I was badly shamed for bringing perfume to school, it was such a haww moment. Then life took over, I would use whatever my cousins got, then my first job perfume was Oriflame muse, so pretty it was. I tried few here and there while visiting malls, but was never determined to get a new one. Got few attars and was ohk as I got so busy in the later half of my 20s running after goals, I almost forget to take care of myself, just followed physical training, as if those years were completely lost, whoosh in a second.

Then after many years I was in Agra and Vrindavan and got some flowers for festival decor. Got bunches of Roses and Mogras and let me tell you Roses grown around Greater Noida, Aligarh and nearby patch of land is so so beautiful and smells di-vine and majorly used in most of the temples of Vrindavan. I had these flowers in my room, the moment I entered back after some time, I got whiff of the most heavenly and divinely beautiful fragrance. This was not the first time I was sniffing flowers, growing up in the far away mountains of Uttarakhand , I had experienced all kinds of flowers in garden, met some saints in small cottages who were gifted Swiss rose by one of their European disciple, and we had it in the garden for many years, these roses would grown in bunches rather than individual flowers, my mother would often make rose water and delicacies. Sadly, these flowers didn't bloom at all in the plains weather. Also I had close relation to mogras as a classical dance practitioner, mogras are always around , either in dance class or in home decor, in gajras. Cut to present, what I experienced that day in room with those flowers mesmerised me once again.

I guess it was nearly this time I had this bizarre dream, where I'm a bride but in a Nikkah setting, despite of I me being a Hindu. As strange as it was and not getting into the details, what I could sense is the fragrance, I felt so beautiful, and the fragrance on me was so Godamn beautiful, that fragrance, search for that fragrance had me running here and there since almost a year, the way a Musk deer runs here and there to look for fragrance, the same way I was on a hunt to find that fragrance. I have not been able to find that fragrance but I'm glad I could smell something in Liris which is akin to my newly married aunt's handkerchief and hence my soul is somewhat satisfied to at least find something if not ""the thing"".

Cut to next, I tried Agar Epice from Lilanur and I almost had an entire post about this, trying to cut the story short, this one took me into some sort of spirals down the memory lane which is hazy and confusing. It reminded me Azans from Mosque, some place with neem trees, water body and sunset with oarge painted skies. I always had a liking for azans and sunsets, not that I was crazy but it is such a soul food for me, also I'm a die hard of NFAK music, much before this generation fell for it. I had many dreams in the past 2-3 years where I'm constantly in a muslim setting since the nikkah dream, then I get some other dream after almost 1.5 year where I'm travelling and I meet someone in a cave sort of tunnel and all of a sudden an old man with long beard does some magic with pink coloured sand & it turned into some ""w"" symbol kept on a green velvet cloth, and he asks me bow down to it, after few days I randomly start googling this ""W and a sword beside it"" symbol and come to know it is the name of Allah and that is how it is written, this freaked the shit out of me.

Cut to next, after 7-8 months I meet a guy for an arrange marriage setting and this was the first time I was meeting someone in such a setting , and the very same night I see a dream where I'm in an old blue coloured home in a village, and seeing off the guy and his family, and suddenly two big goats start running after me and we had a bizarre eye contact, one of the goat and me, creepy enough. Then all of us start entering a dargarh and the guy who came meet me introduces himself to the guys at the entrance as my shauhar, I mean What !!! Then all of sudden all people move ahead and I'm left alone, in some slippery place within dargah and fall down, and, I ask folks to help me get up, but they start saying Tauba and something else too, and don not help me at all. I feel so weak and I'm not able to get up, I wake up out of dream in the morning .

Overall freaky, and this combo of oud and sandalwood in agar Epice triggered nostalgia, and I want to sniff it again and again and almost crave something which even I have no idea of. Strangely I tried remembering details of the nikkah dream because this bloody mind is curious, I remember myself on terrace being a bride, a long veil, a woman in burkha siting beside me on a daybed sort of a thing on terrace, its about to get dark, and I could see a guy, I never focused on the guy as I was running behind ""the frag"", but this Agar Epice meddles with my mind in such a way, now I'm trying to track details of a dream I saw almost 3 years back, so the guy is shaking hands with some 2-3 men when he reaches terrace via a staircase, I could see his eyes for a second maybe, its not an eye contact as I have this long veil on, so I could see him but I think he couldn't see my face,I'm also not sure if he is the groom because he isn't dressed up like one but is wearing Kurta, strangely the guy has some similar vibes to the guy who was my first crush in school, but he is not the same person, his eyes, ""those eyes"". are different., the eyes are not even kind. What is frustrating is I'm trying to remember his face now almost after 3 years and I'm not able to remember and that is pissing me off, I do not want to go down this rabbit hole, but this mind plays tricks. Considering how sensitive religious topics are, this is not meant to hurt anyone's sentiments, there was no other way I could have shared my story without getting into the details.

What is little strange which I almost forgot and thought my mind is playing tricks, is that my mother was helped immensely by a muslim neighbour, who was my father's manager's wife when my mom was expecting me, while she was in Baroda Gujrat far far away from her home town which is in NCR. The lady would often make breakfast for my mom, father and would take my elder sister to her home to feed her along with her kids. My fast pace intense frag journey ends here as I do not want to think much about all this anymore, now that I have thought so much about this entire thing , clearly this has gone to my conscious and subconscious and anything if ever happens again in my dream will be an outcome of all this as per my logic. Keeping safe distance from anything oud and sandalwood. Sadly I couldn't find that dream fragrance which was my pivotal point in this entire journey and something else hit me after testing Agar Epice, also I have now almost forgotten what that fragrances was after trying almost 200 fragrances in an years span. And let me say it looks all made up until it hits you one day. Many fragrances have not been mentioned here as I do not find them appealing and they have been mentioned by someone somewhere here in the sub, pushing those breaks on this journey after eating SA's head in every other store I visited.

Really fantastic show. Loved every season.

Season 4 left me with some questions, and though we may never get answers… Maybe some of you have some insights.

1. What the hell was transcendence?

This ties into some further questions like

2. Was “The City” park the last of all the humans?

Which I know it wasn’t… but then…

3. What about the humans that were out at that diner when Bernard finally returned from his simulations in the Sublime? We know two of them were hosts sent to try and find/intercept outliers… but what of the rest of the people in the diner? Were they hosts? Infected humans? They couldn’t have all been outliers, as those two hosts would have killed them, right?

If they were infected, where were the speakers for controlling them in that scene? And if they were infected, why would they been on loops out in a diner in the middle of nowhere, and not in the city?

Regardless of what they were… where were they getting supplies to run the diner? Coffee? Food? Money to pay employees?

4. What does the rest of the world look like in Hale’s controlled time? Were there other city parks? Are there other humans, outliers or infected? Where are all the other hosts? We hear that they go to the City Park to play the game of hunting outliers and win a chance at transcendence, but where are they otherwise? Do they have their own cities? What do they do?

5. Why was everything we saw outside of The City covered in a huge layer of dust and sand only 30 years after we saw it last? Was there another nuclear war or something? 

Season 4 left… so much unanswered. So much that I wouldn’t even expect to be explored or answered in Season 5 if we had gotten it. ",2,1740861739.0,westworld,0,1.0,False

1j197n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFP/comments/1j197n9/making_it_my_own/,Making it my own…,"TLDR at the bottom. I’m going to give some background which hopefully helps. I’m looking for guidance on where I should prioritize my professional development and that of my book…

To start off, I got a late start to the Financial Planning/Advisor career. I played competitive sport when I was younger and did a bunch of traveling. Took my time finishing an undergrad and grad degree in Kinesiology before moving into sport/non-profit management. Worked in a couple roles for about 5 years before my wife and I had our first kid and I started to look at my career prospects, for which income wasn’t great. My father had worked in insurance sales and transitioned to an independent advisor over his career and was looking for some help so I came on in an admin/support role and enjoyed it. I got my CSC (I’m based in Canada) and after a few years my CFP. My father is looking to retire and we have set up an income stream that I’ll pay him for taking over the book. When I started about 6 years ago it was at $20 million, were a bit over $35 million now. 

I’m hoping to get some guidance on next steps. I’m very fortunate to not have to build my own book from scratch, but the situation doesn’t come without its own drawbacks. For one, my father is still involved and we don’t have a clear path forward for him to be “done”. He doesn’t want to feel like he’s abandoning his long-time clients, but he also doesn’t want to be working many hours. We have a part time (15-20hrs/wk) admin person as well but the book does keep the 3 of us still pretty busy. I’m reviewing software and incorporating options to try and make my life easier and more efficient but it’s slow going. 

 Historically, he also ran the book “old school” ie) no niche focus, mainly investment management with mutual funds and some insurance sales on the side. As a millennial, I’m more fee conscious and want to incorporate more index/low fee options but I do get pushback at times. I like the idea of having some model portfolios that incorporate ETFs and some mutual funds to make that aspect of managing smaller clients feasible. 

As he transitions out I think I’m going to need to hire either more admin help, a junior/associate advisor, or both but I feel like I need to get my infrastructure/systems in place before training someone new. Thoughts? When is it appropriate to add personnel? And how have other advisors structured comp for those individuals?

Lastly, I’ve been operating primarily out of my home office and meeting clients online, at their house, or going for lunch/coffee. In some ways I feel like having an office space is necessary but I also feel like I’d only need it a few times a month. Do bite the bullet and just do it or should I abstain and look at going more virtual? Or have people had success utilizing co-working spaces?

Thanks in advance for your feedback!!

TD:DR - I inherited a book from my father who was an advisor but it’s not set up the way I would choose, and I’m also not sure how to scale and add personnel. Would like some guidance on people who grew/transitioned from being a single advisor to setting up a shop/small team. ",5,1740861646.0,CFP,4,1.0,False

a little context - we met in early october. he came up to me in the coffee shop and introduced himself, complimented the drawing i was working on, and had a little chat. he asked me for my number, but i just gave him my instagram instead because i’m a very anxious person, i don’t give my number out to anyone. and i’ve never had anyone take interest in me in person (i’ve tried dating apps but just not enjoyed it at all), so i was so taken aback by it all that i said screw it, let’s meet him. i’ve been trying to challenge my anxieties and i already felt like a late bloomer because i hadn’t been involved with anyone before. the worst that could happen was we didn’t get along, and then i could just go home and forget about it.

we met a couple days later for a drink and hit it off instantly. the next two months were so fun, we spent a lot of time together watching dumb movies, going for walks, making art together, going to a comic convention, late night deep talks, the whole shebang. we were really similar people and i eventually found myself falling for him, and falling for him hard. he talked about loving to travel, having spent time in australia when he was a kid and really wanting to go back someday. in an ideal world he’d love to move back but he said he just wanted to travel there because it wasn’t possible. not a problem, a month/two month long visit, awesome!

i asked him early december if i could be his girlfriend, and he said yes! for the next week i was absolutely buzzing that i finally had a partner for the first time in my life, and with a really great guy nonetheless. i was so giddy whenever i thought about him, it felt so childish but also i never got my young love story dammit, and i was finally living in it.

he messages me the next week telling me he needs to talk with me. i was immediately really anxious, and i knew it was either a) he was cheating on me (but he didn’t seem the ‘type’ to cheat), or b) he was going away imminently. he comes over, and it’s the latter. but, he then tells me that he’s not just visiting, but moving there to get his citizenship (which takes around 4 years). he just needed to send off some visa forms, then he would be gone before new years. he said that he actually knew he wanted to move back, but reconsidered it after he met me. he talked it through with some of his family, and they convinced him that if it was what he wanted, he needed to just do it.

i was devastated. i took a day off work because i felt so shit, and cried the rest of the week i was in work. we didn’t speak for most of december, but i was beginning to come to terms with it. i knew when he said it that it’s what he really wanted and i had no resentment for him at all. i wanted to see him prosper, and i was okay with that if it was without me, i’d just have to get over it and move on.

just after christmas i went to his house and posted a letter through the postbox, explaining that i was really happy for him, and that i’m sorry i fell for him so hard. i was sorry that i was this wedge in his life, and i really appreciated the time i had with him, everything he taught me, the cool things we got to do and experience. i wished him well for australia! i also posted him a christmas present: a small travel sketchbook and a pen set, because he said he really wanted to get back in to drawing after seeing me do it. on the walk back i cried to myself, knowing that i was never going to see him again.

his visa documents didn’t get approved for a whole month and a half, so we DID actually see each other twice more, and both times just felt like how it did right at the start, like nothing was even happening. and then, early february, he finally left.

i cried a lot. and then, it got easier. i had my birthday recently, and had an amazing time with my friends and family. i was beginning to get over it, i thought.

and then this evening it’s all come crashing down. we never got any photos together, the only physical thing i have of his is one of the paintings we made together, and, TMI, but some of his pubic hairs were still left on my bed. i noticed that they weren’t there anymore. i don’t know why that in particular set me off crying, but it really did.

and now i’m just left with a lot of questions, a lot of advice needed that i can’t ask anyone. my friends understand it, but two of them are in a lesbian relationship with each other, and aren’t ‘late bloomers’ like myself. i’m bisexual so it’s even more complex navigating what i feel about people. i’m wondering if i feel normal, if me and him ever were anything to begin with, why he came up to me if he knew he was going to leave, why i let myself fall so hard, will i ever find anything like this again, should i have gotten over this by now because we weren’t even really official, do i go try find someone on a dating app to fuck to try get over it or do i wait around for someone else to approach me, etcetera.

i know in time i’ll get over it, but having had the end of the relationship drag on for nearly two months while he was waiting to leave really tore at me because he was still THERE, and now he isn’t. and i probably won’t ever see him again and there’s nothing i can do about it. i’m trying to look positively at the good times we had together, because the relationship was incredible. i’m so happy that i had such a good first experience, i’m happy that he’s happier now, but i’m so sad it ended this way.

so - how do i get over this, how do i move on, what should my next steps be, is it normal to feel like this, did i fall too fast?

1j1950d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j1950d/the_valley_and_the_shadow/,The Valley and the Shadow,"I realised there was a ghost in my window after Lucy moved out. 

I was slumped in my couch, aching with missing her, and then – you know how you feel when someone staring is at you, and look over and someone actually is? That happened. I could feel eyes on me, I looked around, and there she was, her reflection in our fifth-floor apartment window. 

My. My apartment. Lucy had moved out by then, and I was by myself. 

I stood up, I might have cried out from fear- I don’t remember  

(I don’t know why Lucy left, some bullshit about growing out of the relationship or whatever) 

I went over to the window, which looked over a narrow alley and snowy roofs. Our apartment building was in a street mostly with townhouses. 

My. My apartment building. 

Anyway, the face in the window didn’t budge, or blink. Just stared. I stared back. 

I couldn’t tell if the face was outside the window, or in the window, if that makes sense. On impulse, pushing the limp curtains fully aside, I opened the window. Wind howled in from the street-lit darkness. I quickly pulled the window close again. 

Her face glimmered back into the glass, backlit from the streetlight. 

And then I noticed- I’m not a noticing sort, which Lucy had pointed out but not while she was leaving, it seemed to take such a long time too, from when she said I’m leaving you, to when she actually banged out of the apartment dragging her suitcase, like an eternity- 

Oh right, I noticed her hair. It was all done up fancy, and there were lights- no, sparkles, like jewels in her hair, a trail of elaborate sparkles running from the tops of her ears towards the back. 

And then, as I stared and she stared back, tears running down her pale cheeks, it clicked. 

She was a bride. She was done up similar to girls at their weddings- we had been to a wedding a few months back, Lucy and I, and I remember the hair and the sparkling jewels curving around the bride's  forehead. Pretty. I had joked with Lucy she should wear her hair like that, and she had snapped “that’s not funny Charles”. 

Come to think of it, things kind of went downhill between us after the wedding. I asked her if she wanted to get married, and she said, “that’s not what this is about” and screwed up her mouth. I had felt like banging my head against the wall in frustration. “Then just tell me” I had yelled, begged. 

The girl opened her mouth and I remembered my living room was haunted. She looked like Lucy, but different. 

“Lucy?” I faltered, reaching my hand to the window. She also raised her hand, and through the ice touch of the glass I felt her fingers, warm and reassuring. 

The warmth of her fingers was the first thing that ignited actual fear in me. It blazed in me as my eyes stretched wide-open, and the blaze burned my fog of heartbreak and confusion and made me see clearly: The girl in the window wasn’t Lucy- in fact looked nothing like her- but a supernatural sad bridal creature, haunting me.  

I snatched my hand away and leapt back. The woman’s face shone brightly in the glass, and she smiled. Her painted lips moved.  

“Let me in Charles, I’m so cold.” 

I blinked. How could I – what did she mean? On impulse, I pulled the curtains, which had been hanging back, close together, and collapsed back on the couch.  

I realised I was sweating. And very soon after, a great wave of fatigue pulled me under, and I fell into the deepest slumber I have ever known.  

I forgot to think about Lucy much the next day. Occasionally the bride’s face in the window swam into my mind. I didn’t feel much fear anymore, and towards the end of the day, I found myself wondering if she would still be there.   

She was.  

We stared at each other. Our fingers touched through the glass. “Let me in-” her words glided into my brain. “I can help you. I know how you feel.”  

My brain jerked. I snatched my fingers away, and let the curtains fall. How could she know how I felt? The huge fatigue welled up in me again, and the image of the face the last thing I saw before everything went black. 

The next day was Saturday. For the first time since Lucy left, I was happy it was a Saturday, and the day didn’t loom pointlessly in front of me. I went straight to the local library, which I hadn’t visit since childhood, and dove into the local archives.  

In an hour or so I had found what I needed to know. My building was built on the site of a large old house. About fifty years ago, a young bride had jumped out of a balcony to her death after the groom-to-be jilted her the morning of their wedding, a sensational local news story. I stared at the young sad face of the bride in the digitized old newspaper, the same face that looked at me from my window every night, asking to be let back in. 

But even if I wanted to, how could I? That evening, I flung the window open, hoping to be rid of her longing stare into my soul. And there was nothing, just the street night glare and icy rush of window. The moment I pulled the window shut, she shone into the glass. “Let me in Charles. I can help you, I know how you feel.” 

They say you get used to everything, and soon I got used to that sad sparkly face in the window, yearning to come in, claiming to help me. And even though I couldn’t bring her back in, I think maybe she was helping me. Because I seemed to be thinking about Lucy less and less. I resumed my usual gym routine, and a few weeks after that visit to the library, I gave in to the insistence of my friends to set up a new dating profile. Very soon after that, I found myself going out on coffee dates, which then progressed to dinner dates, and from there to do-you-want-to-come-back-to-my-place dates with lovely Helen.  

As we settled on the couch, I turned and pulled Helen close to me, savouring this new romantic bliss.  

A shine caught my eyes and my eyelids fluttered opened. I glimpsed the face in the window over Helen’s shoulder, the sparkle and shine of her eyes and teeth and the jewels in her hair and the street lights dazzled me. I jerked away from Helen, and cried out. How could I have forgotten about her?  

Helen smiled politely at me. “What’s wrong Charles?” 

“The curtains-” I muttered and stood up and walked over to pull them close.  

The face came up so close I could feel the warmth of her skin. “Now Charles!” she begged. “Let me in now!” 

Without thinking, I pulled the window open. Icy air whooshed in.  

“Just want a breath of fresh air.” I heard myself explaining to Helen, who seemed quite motionless on the couch.  

I went back to the couch, and settled next to her. “Helen?” I placed my arms around her, pulling her towards me.  

And then I saw the sparkles in her hair, the jewels tucked in an elaborate and familiar pattern around her ears and curling back.  

I cried out in horror, reeling back. The face from the window was superimposed on Helen’s lively pretty features. “Oh Charles, it’s so warm here. Never let me back out.” 

“Helen!” I cried, horrified at what I had done. I grabbed her shoulders and started shaking her. “Helen, listen to me!” I shook her again, and she smiled at me, lying back on the couch, her face another’s.  

I took her by the hand, yanked her to her feet, dragged her to the window, and flung it open. “Out! Out!” I cried, and we tussled in the rush of cold black air. Her hands were strong on mine, pulling me through the window. All the lights and sparkles seemed to turn upside down, and suddenly I was dangling outside, with nothing beneath me. My hands gripped the railing, and I could feel a force greater than gravity pulling me down.  

“Charles!” screamed Helen. I looked up at her, and she bent towards me, her face her own.  “Hold on” she gasped, and she pulled at me. I was able to climb up and crawl in, gripping her arms. I heard her cries of pain but she remained steady. Once in, I immediately slammed the window shut, and we collapsed, entwined and panting on the floor.   

After a while we got up. Helen said casually she’s going to put the kettle on for a cuppa. It sounded like a good idea, and I said I wanted one too. As I followed her into the kitchen, I looked back at the living room window, which was black, reflecting the normal glare of street lights. Helen was kind and gentle to me.   

I never saw the face in the window again.  ",4,1740861456.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

Hi everyone! I'm a novice witch at the VERY start of my practice. I've barely started building my altar and I'm still reading my first book or two regarding witchcraft/Wicca. I tried to look through previous posts in this subreddit for more info/discussion but I didn't see to much on the topic: widdershins vs. deosil. I figure I'll get quite a few answers along the lines of ""everyone practices in their own way,"" etc., but I'm really curious to see what feedback everyone has to share.

  
I figure I didn't see much discussion because it seems that the traditional understanding is pretty self-explanatory: deosil=clockwise/sunwise/invoking/casting/building energy (or deosil=""good,"" for lack of a better term), and widdershins=counterclockwise/banishing/reversing/releasing energy (or widdershins=""bad""). I know neither are truly negative things, and I've read that they both have their place in casting and releasing circles for ritual, etc., and that the negative connotations for widdershins have been handed down from older traditions. However, when I try to envision myself casting, walking, or even stirring my coffee deosil, I feel a lot of...resistance? I feel more called to cast widdershins because I feel the God and the Goddess are omnipresent, in all things, and the circle I create is not me calling the energies to myself, but rather banishing the unnecessary/external energies that would interfere with a ritual or spell -- in other words, by casting widdershins, I feel like I am establishing a space where only the God and Goddess are left. It's like being able to eliminate ""distractions"" and giving myself a ""pure"" space to practice. Like I pushed it all out and put myself in a bubble, if that makes sense.



My question is, is it truly unsafe/taboo, even if I feel like I'm being called to cast this way? I'm really curious to see if anyone has any experience to share from their own practice, especially negative or unconventional experiences or things to watch out for.

  
tl;dr -- I'm new and I feel called to cast my circles/etc. counterclockwise. Am I going to regret this?

https://preview.redd.it/68ditcel15me1.jpg?width=4898&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0290e541b762191ffc03d916087bfa7ddd5de6c

# How It All Began

It all started with a simple tweet back in 2012. A friend of mine, Wel El Kebba, expressed his frustration on Twitter: ""How can you find a place to drink coffee during Ramadan? It's unbearable."" This resonated deeply with me. In Tunisia, a predominantly conservative country, not fasting during Ramadan as an adult is considered shameful, and most cafés remain closed or operate with extreme discretion during this holy month.

That tweet sparked an idea. I created the hashtag #Fater (meaning ""non-faster"" in Arabic) to build a community where people could share information about establishments that remained open during Ramadan. Little did I know that this simple initiative would evolve into a movement that would challenge deeply rooted societal norms and eventually become a cornerstone for freedom of conscience in Tunisia.

# From Hashtag to Community

What began as a hashtag quickly evolved into a vibrant online group. #Fater became a refuge for those who, for health reasons or personal choices, opted not to fast during Ramadan. Year after year, our community grew stronger, eventually becoming an annual rendezvous for thousands of Tunisians.

The impact was substantial enough that businesses began to take notice. Cafés and restaurants started sharing their addresses on our platform, specifically targeting those seeking refreshments during the fasting hours. What had started as a practical solution to a common problem transformed into a genuine social phenomenon, attracting attention from both local and international media.

# Facing Opposition and Threats

Our journey wasn't without challenges. The #Fater community has faced—and continues to face—aggressive opposition from religious extremists. We've endured multiple hacking attempts, online threats, and constant trolling from individuals brandishing the argument of ""offense to the sacred.""

In 2018, several cafés were illegally shut down for serving customers during Ramadan. These violations of freedom highlighted the need for more organized action. That's when Hatem Imam from the ""Free Thinkers of Tunisia"" association approached me. Together, we organized the first #MouBessif demonstration—the first protest for freedom of conscience in the Arab-Muslim world. This marked a significant escalation from online activism to street-level advocacy.

# Building a Movement Across Platforms

Today, the #Fater community stands strong and united. We've expanded beyond our original Facebook group to establish a significant presence across multiple platforms:

* Over 20,000 members in our Facebook group
* 18,000 followers on our dedicated page
* Active communities on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube

This growth reflects not just numbers but a genuine societal shift. If today the taboo of not fasting during Ramadan has become a topic of peaceful debate in Tunisia, it's largely due to more than ten years of activism. Throughout this journey, I've firmly believed in a pluralistic Tunisia and have been fortunate to receive support from civil society and our incredible #Fater community.

# Breaking New Ground: The 2017 Public Picnic

One of our most defining moments came on June 11, 2017, when we organized an unprecedented public picnic in Tunis during fasting hours. This was a groundbreaking event for a country like Tunisia, where such public displays were previously unthinkable.

As I reflected to the media at that time, ""What I've done all my life is hide. But this new generation wants more. They want to eat, drink, and even consume alcohol during Ramadan in public."" This movement represents a profound desire to end the hypocrisy and stop being persecuted for personal choices.

# The Legal Gray Area

What many don't realize is that there's no explicit law in Tunisian legislation requiring everyone to fast or prohibiting non-fasters from eating in public. As Fida Hammami from Amnesty International Tunis has pointed out, the persecution of non-fasters has no legal basis.

Despite this, arrests continue to occur. Since we began our movement, several people have been detained and convicted simply for smoking or eating during the fasting period. This contradiction between law and practice underscores the importance of our advocacy.

# The Annual Revival

It's become something of a tradition now. Each year, as Ramadan approaches, Tunisians ""resurrect"" the Fater group. Just this year, in March 2024, mere hours before the mufti of the Republic announced the beginning of Ramadan, our community was already active, sharing locations and supporting each other.

This annual revival speaks to a persistent need. Despite progress, navigating Ramadan as a non-faster in Tunisia remains complicated. The Mzali circular of 1981—which mandated the closure of cafés and restaurants during Ramadan and prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages to Tunisians—technically was canceled days after its publication by then-President Habib Bourguiba. Yet, its spirit continues to influence social norms and enforcement practices.

# Beyond Practical Assistance: A Platform for Critical Discourse

The #Fater community has evolved beyond its original purpose of sharing ""good addresses."" It has become a space for critical thinking about Ramadan itself. Members discuss contradictions they observe: how prices of food rise during what should be a spiritual month, how inequalities are accentuated, and how the period sometimes increases stress and aggression rather than promoting peace and reflection.

Some of these conversations challenge deeply held beliefs, which explains why they sometimes need to be moderated or removed to prevent escalating tensions between believers and non-believers. Finding this balance between free expression and respectful dialogue remains an ongoing challenge.

# Looking Forward: The Future of #Fater

After more than a decade of activism, I see #Fater's journey as part of Tunisia's larger struggle with identity, religion, and individual freedoms. What began as a simple solution to find a cup of coffee during Ramadan has blossomed into a movement advocating for freedom of conscience in a region where such freedoms aren't always guaranteed.

Our community now represents a generation that refuses to hide or apologize for their personal choices. We've moved from secretly sharing addresses in private messages to organizing public demonstrations and building a cross-platform community that advocates openly for change.

The progress we've made fills me with pride, but our work is far from complete. As long as people face persecution for their choice not to fast, as long as establishments are illegally closed for serving food during Ramadan, and as long as the taboo persists, #Fater will continue to provide support, advocate for change, and fight for a Tunisia where personal freedom is respected.

# A Personal Reflection

When I look back at that tweet from 2012 that started it all, I'm amazed at how far we've come. What began as a practical solution to find a coffee during Ramadan has evolved into a movement that challenges societal norms and advocates for fundamental freedoms.

Through #Fater, I've witnessed firsthand how a simple idea can grow into something much larger when it addresses a genuine need and resonates with people's lived experiences. The strength of our community doesn't come from me as its founder but from the thousands of Tunisians who have found in #Fater a space where they can be themselves without judgment or fear.

As we continue this journey, I remain committed to the vision of a pluralistic Tunisia—a country where diversity of thought is not just tolerated but celebrated, where personal choices are respected, and where freedom of conscience is recognized as a fundamental right.

The story of #Fater is still being written, one Ramadan at a time, by a community that refuses to remain silent or hidden. And for as long as this struggle continues, I'll be proud to stand alongside them.

If you’ve ever found yourself staring at a Bitcoin ATM, wondering if it’s a time machine or a magic money portal, you’re not alone. Bitcoin ATMs are popping up everywhere, turning everyday locations into crypto hotspots. Whether you’re grabbing a coffee, hitting the gym, or waiting for your laundry, you might spot one of these futuristic machines humming quietly in the corner. But how do they actually work, and what’s this about a Bitcoin QR code maker app making life even easier? Buckle up, because we’re diving into the wonderful world of Bitcoin ATMs and how they pair perfectly with [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)!

# What is a Bitcoin ATM, Anyway?

Imagine a regular ATM but instead of spitting out paper bills, it connects you to the digital gold rush—Bitcoin! A Bitcoin ATM (or BTM) lets you buy Bitcoin (and sometimes sell it) with cash or a debit card. Some even let you withdraw cash by selling your Bitcoin, making them the perfect bridge between traditional money and the crypto universe.

# How Bitcoin ATMs Work

* **Buying Bitcoin:** You insert cash or use your debit card, scan your Bitcoin wallet’s QR code, and—boom—your BTC is sent to your wallet in seconds.
* **Selling Bitcoin:** Some machines allow you to send BTC to an address provided by the ATM and get cash in return.
* **Verification:** Depending on the machine and the amount, you might need to verify your identity (because the powers that be don’t want total anonymity—yet!).

Bitcoin ATMs make crypto more accessible, especially for newcomers who aren’t ready to navigate online exchanges. But here’s the kicker: to use them efficiently, you NEED a **Bitcoin QR code**. That’s where our handy tool comes in.

# Why QR Codes are a Game-Changer for Bitcoin ATMs

If you’ve ever tried to manually type a Bitcoin wallet address, you know it’s about as fun as reciting Pi to 100 digits. Enter **QR codes**—those black-and-white squares of magic that turn long, complex crypto addresses into a simple scan-and-go experience.

# Benefits of Using a Bitcoin QR Code Maker

* **Instant Transactions:** No need to copy-paste or memorize a lengthy address—just scan and send!
* **Eliminates Human Error:** One wrong character in your BTC address and your funds could be lost forever. A QR code removes that risk.
* **Super Convenient:** Whether you’re at a Bitcoin ATM, paying for coffee, or sending funds to a friend, a QR code makes transactions smooth and effortless.

# How [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) Simplifies Your Life

Our app is a lifesaver when it comes to creating Bitcoin QR codes. Here’s why:

* **Free & Easy to Use:** No sign-ups, no hassle—just enter your BTC address and get a QR code instantly.
* **Secure & Private:** We don’t store your data, so your transactions remain yours alone.
* **Perfect for Business Owners:** Accept Bitcoin payments at your shop or online with a simple QR code.
* **Works with Bitcoin ATMs:** No more fumbling around—generate your code before you hit the ATM and speed up your transaction.

# Where to Find Bitcoin ATMs

Now that you’re armed with your Bitcoin QR code, where can you actually find a Bitcoin ATM? Good news—there are thousands worldwide! Websites like CoinATMRadar can help you locate one near you. They’re often found in:

* Shopping malls
* Gas stations
* Coffee shops
* Convenience stores
* Airports

Some of these ATMs support multiple cryptocurrencies, but if you’re a Bitcoin purist (like us), you’ll want to double-check before heading out.

# Pro Tips for Using a Bitcoin ATM Like a Pro

* **Check the Fees:** Bitcoin ATMs can have higher fees than exchanges, so compare rates if possible.
* **Bring Your Wallet Ready:** Use [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) to generate your code before you arrive.
* **Verify the Machine’s Limits:** Some ATMs have minimum and maximum transaction amounts.
* **Be Aware of Security:** Since you’re handling crypto in public, be cautious of prying eyes.

# The Future of Bitcoin ATMs and QR Codes

Bitcoin ATMs are evolving fast. More locations, lower fees, and better interfaces are making them a legitimate alternative to traditional banking. Meanwhile, QR codes are becoming the go-to method for quick, secure crypto transactions—whether at an ATM, a store, or between friends.

By combining Bitcoin ATMs with [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), we’re making it easier than ever to use Bitcoin in the real world. So next time you see one of those glowing Bitcoin ATMs, don’t just walk by—give it a whirl! And make sure you have your QR code ready to make the process seamless.

It seeped into my bones, settling in my marrow like a sickness. I opened my eyes to a fluorescent glare, sterile white walls, the low hum of machinery. A hospital? No, something worse. The air smelled of antiseptic and metal, but beneath it lurked something foul—like burned hair and spoiled meat.

I tried to move. The restraints cut into my wrists and ankles. Panic jolted through me like a live wire.

Where the hell was I?

A voice crackled over an unseen speaker. Male. Clinical. Devoid of anything resembling human warmth.

“Subject 18 C is awake. Increased durability and metabolic response confirmed. Beginning Phase Three.”

A hissing noise. Gas poured in from the vents. My chest clenched as I fought the urge to cough, but the moment I inhaled, something shifted inside me. Heat flooded my limbs, my pulse hammering against my ribs. my muscles burned, stretched—no, not just stretched. Strengthened.

a deep, twisting ache unfurled inside my bones, like something was burrowing through my marrow. My spine felt wrong—too long, too tight, shifting when I moved. A wet, sickening crack echoed through the sterile room, and for a horrible second, I thought it came from my own ribs.

My heart shouldn’t beat this fast. My blood shouldn’t feel alive.

I pulled at the restraints again. This time, the steel didn’t just resist—it bent.

The intercom buzzed again, and for the first time, the voice sounded surprised. “Subject 18 C is exceeding expected thresholds.”

I wasn’t supposed to do this. They thought I’d stay weak, compliant. Human.

A door hissed open. Heavy boots echoed against the floor. Five men in tactical gear stormed in, rifles raised. Their visors reflected the overhead lights, blank and faceless.

“Restrain him.”

One stepped forward, reaching for a syringe. I let him get close. Let him think I was still strapped down.

Then I moved.

I don’t know how to explain what happened next. One second, I was still; the next, I was everywhere. My hands found his wrist before he could react. 

I squeezed, and something inside his arm popped. He screamed, crumpling to the ground.

His wrist didn’t just break—it caved inward. Bone and sinew collapsed with a wet, grinding crunch, jagged splinters stabbing through his skin like exposed ivory fangs. He shrieked, a raw, primal sound—not just pain, but terror. Like he knew, deep down, that I was something worse than him.

The others opened fire.

I should have died.

Instead, I moved faster than I thought possible. The bullets were slow. I could see them in the air, the world dragging as my body surged into overdrive. I twisted, dodging—until something hit me square in the chest.

A tranquilizer.

My legs buckled. The room swam. I collapsed, body numb, mind screaming.

The last thing I heard before the darkness swallowed me was the voice over the speaker. Calm. Almost pleased.

“Let’s see how quickly he recovers.”

I woke up in a different room.

No restraints. No tactical guards. Just a single chair, a steel table, and a man in a suit watching me with calculating eyes.

He folded his hands. “You’re adjusting faster than expected.”

I didn’t answer. My body still felt off—wired, too strong. But I wasn’t about to give him the satisfaction of knowing that.

He leaned forward. “You’re an asset now, Subject 18 C. A weapon. We can help you refine your abilities. Give you purpose.”

I stared at him. “And if I refuse?”

The corner of his mouth twitched. “You won’t.”

A silent threat.

A promise.

I could have run.

The thought burned in the back of my mind as I stared at the man in the suit. The door was ten feet away. My body thrummed with power I barely understood, instincts screaming at me to move, to tear my way out.

But I forced myself to breathe. To think.

They’d be expecting me to run.

So instead, I leaned back in my chair, flexing my fingers experimentally. The residual strength lingered in my muscles, the memory of that fight still fresh. If they wanted me to play along? Fine. I’d play their game—until I understood the rules.

I met his gaze. “I’m listening.”

A smile. Small. Knowing. Like he had already won.

“Good,” he said. “Welcome to The Division.”

They trained me fast over the next few years.

I learned about The Division—a black-budget organization buried so deep in the government that not even the Pentagon could trace their funding. Their job? Containment. Eradication. Hunting things that shouldn’t exist.

Cryptids. Aberrations. Creatures that had no place in this world.

I was part of Project Revenant, one of a handful of subjects enhanced through genetic augmentation and experimental procedures. The goal wasn’t just super-soldiers. It was adaptation. Something that could go toe-to-toe with the things hiding in the dark and win.

The first few months were hell. They pushed my body to its limits, testing my durability, my strength, my reflexes. I learned that I could take bullets and keep moving. My metabolism worked on overdrive, healing injuries in hours, not days. My senses sharpened—I could hear a heartbeat from across a room, see in the dark like it was daylight.

But I wasn’t immortal.

I could be hurt. I could be killed.

And the things I hunted? They were stronger. Smarter. Older.

My first mission wasn’t a test.

It was a baptism.

A small town in Montana. Isolated. Surrounded by dense forest. People had been going missing for months, but the bodies that turned up weren’t just corpses. They were emptied. Hollowed out like something had burrowed inside them and eaten its way out.

The locals whispered about the Skin Man.

The reports called it an Atypical Class-4 Predator.

I called it a monster.

They sent me in with a team. Five seasoned operatives, all of them hardened, professional. I was the rookie. The experiment. The one they weren’t sure would make it back.

By the time the night was over, I was the only one still breathing.

The Skin Man wasn’t just fast. It was impossibly fast. It moved through the trees like a shadow, limbs too long, joints bending the wrong way.

Its skin didn’t stretch—it rippled. Muscles twitched beneath the surface like trapped rats, tendons snapping into new positions with a wet, suctioning pop. When it grinned, its jaw unhinged, revealing rows of uneven, needle-thin teeth, clacking together as if they were laughing at me.

Bullets barely slowed it down. Fire worked better.

But I learned something else that night.

I wasn’t just stronger than before.

I was something else.

When it lunged at me, something deep in my brain—something primal—clicked.

The world slowed. My body moved on instinct, dodging before I could even process the attack. My hands found its throat. I crushed it. Felt the cartilage snap beneath my grip.

And for one terrible moment—one awful, exhilarating second—I enjoyed it.

The fire inside me wasn’t just strength. It was hunger.

I buried that feeling deep.

Burned the Skin Man’s corpse.

Told myself I was still human.

The Years That Followed

They kept sending me into the field.

Every mission, a new nightmare.

	•	A creature in the Appalachians that mimicked voices, luring hikers off the trail, only for their bones to turn up weeks later—picked clean.

	•	An abandoned bunker where something not quite human still roamed the halls, whispering in a dozen different voices.

	•	A coastal town plagued by a “disease” that left its victims bloated and brimming with writhing things just beneath their skin.

I fought. I survived. I changed.

Every mission left its mark. Scars I should have healed from. Memories I couldn’t erase.

I told myself I was doing the right thing. That The Division was keeping the world safe.

But some nights, when I looked in the mirror, I saw something else.

Not a hero.

Not even a soldier.

Just a man slowly becoming what he hunted.

The job changed me.

Not just in the obvious ways. Yeah, I was stronger. Faster. I healed from wounds that should’ve been fatal. But there was something else—something deeper. I didn’t just hunt monsters.

I was starting to understand them.

I could hear them before I saw them. Feel them in the air, like their presence pressed against some part of me I couldn’t explain. And sometimes—just for a second—I swore I could think like them.

I chalked it up to instincts. Experience. The kind of thing that happens when you spend years tracking things that shouldn’t exist.

But now, I’m not so sure.

Because last night, I found something I wasn’t supposed to.

And today, I met a monster that knew my name.

It started with a mission. A simple containment op—or at least, that’s what they told me.

A Category 5 Anomaly had appeared outside an abandoned hospital in rural Wyoming. The locals never saw it, just heard the sounds—guttural, inhuman shrieking, followed by long stretches of silence. The Division classified it as a Spectral Aberration, some kind of semi-corporeal entity drawn to places of suffering.

I’d handled things like that before.

But this time, they weren’t sending a team.

Just me.

Alone.

That should’ve been my first clue.

The hospital was a corpse of a building. Hollow. Decayed. The walls were covered in years of mold and neglect, the floor sagging with rot. The air smelled thick, wet—like something had been festering here for years.

But I wasn’t alone.

I could feel it.

The weight of something watching me, the electric tingle in my spine that always came before a fight.

I moved carefully, stepping through the ruined hallways, my flashlight beam cutting through the dark. My breath sounded too loud in the silence.

Then I found the room.

The door was already open, barely hanging on its hinges. Inside, the walls were covered in old, yellowed papers—Division files. Some of them so decayed they crumbled at my touch.

But one caught my eye.

A sealed case file. Thick. Intact. Marked with a single name.

Project Revenant.

My stomach twisted.

This was my project.

My file.

I flipped it open, skimming pages filled with dense government jargon. Test results. Biological analysis. But the deeper I read, the colder I felt.

Subject #18 C exhibits unprecedented neural adaptation to foreign genetic sequences.

Metabolic responses suggest latent compatibility with nonhuman physiology.

New projections implies Subject can lift up to a few tons and healing ability will increase over time further testing will be needed.

Further mutations expected. Long-term psychological effects unknown.

And then—one line.

A single note scribbled in the margins.

The others didn’t survive. But he did. Why?

My blood ran cold.

The others?

I never knew there were others.

My breath came faster, heartbeat pounding in my ears. I turned another page— medical images. MRIs. Bone scans. A body that should’ve been mine but wasn’t quite.

The skull too thick. The ribcage subtly wrong. The fingers elongated, with faint traces of—

No.

I slammed the file shut. My hands were shaking.

I needed to leave.

Then the voice came.

From behind me.

Low. Familiar. Wrong.

“You weren’t supposed to find that.”

I spun, gun raised.

And froze.

The thing standing in the doorway wasn’t human.

At first glance, it looked like a man—tall, broad-shouldered, wearing what might have once been a Division field uniform. But the flesh wasn’t right. It moved too much. Like something beneath the skin was constantly shifting, adjusting, trying to find the right shape.

Its eyes locked onto mine.

And it smiled.

“Hello, brother.”

The words hit me like a gunshot.

I didn’t answer. Couldn’t.

The thing chuckled, tilting its head. “You don’t remember, do you?”

I steadied my aim. “I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.”

The thing exhaled, something between a sigh and a rattle. “They always wipe the memories. Makes it easier when the failures start stacking up.”

My grip tightened. “Failures?”

“You think you’re the first?” It gestured vaguely to itself. “There were twelve of us before you. Revenants. Some lasted days. Others, weeks. Me?” A twisted grin. “I lasted years. Until they decided I wasn’t ‘human’ enough anymore.”

I shook my head. No. This was a trick. A lie.

“I don’t believe you.”

The thing took a slow step forward. The shadows clung to it, like the darkness itself was bending around its form.

“Then why do you feel it?” It gestured at me, at my hands—where the veins pulsed faintly under my skin, darkened with something not quite normal.

I swallowed hard.

It leaned in. “You’ve noticed it, haven’t you? The instincts. The way you can track them. The hunger.”

I didn’t answer.

Because I had.

For years, I had buried it. Ignored the way I could sense the things we hunted. The way my body moved before my brain could react. The flickers of something else inside me.

“Get out of my way,” I said, voice low.

The thing laughed. “You don’t get it, do you? I’m not your enemy. They are.”

The Division.

The people who turned me into this.

The people who lied to me.

For the first time, I hesitated.

The thing—the other Revenant—tilted its head. Watching me. Waiting.

Then, from far off, I heard it.

The sound of helicopters

The Division was coming.

I didn’t lower my gun.

The thing—the Revenant—watched me with something almost like amusement. It knew I was considering its words. That somewhere, deep down, I was listening.

But I forced myself to focus.

“Get on your knees,” I said. “Hands behind your head.”

The Revenant’s grin widened. “Still playing the good little soldier, huh?” It took another slow step forward. “You think they’ll pat you on the head after this? Tell you what a good job you did?”

I adjusted my aim. “I won’t ask again.”

A chuckle. Deep. Wrong. “God, they really did a number on you.”

The distant rumble of helicopters grew louder. The Division was closing in. I had minutes before this place was swarming with armed operatives.

The Revenant knew it too.

Its expression shifted, the amusement fading. Something colder settled into its voice. “I get it, you know. You need to believe you’re still one of them. That all the things you’ve done—the things they made you do—meant something.”

My jaw tightened. “Shut up.”

“You ever wonder why they keep sending you alone?” It gestured to the ruined hospital around us. “Why they don’t put you on teams anymore?”

I said nothing.

Because I had wondered.

At first, I thought it was because I was their best. Their most capable. But lately, the missions had started to feel different.

Like they weren’t just testing my skills.

Like they were watching me.

The Revenant’s eyes flicked to my hands. “You’ve noticed it, haven’t you? The strength. The instincts. The way you can feel them before you see them.”

I forced my hands to stay steady.

“That’s not training,” it said. “That’s them.”

I didn’t ask what it meant. I didn’t have to.

I already knew.

The experiments didn’t just make me stronger. They made me like them.

Like the things I hunted.

“You can still fight it,” I said, trying to ignore the doubt curling in my chest. “Turn yourself in. Maybe they can fix you.”

The Revenant laughed.

“Fix me?” It shook its head. “You really don’t get it. They did this to me, same as they did it to you. But the second I stopped looking human enough, I was disposable.”

I swallowed hard.

“You think you’re any different?” It took another step forward, slow and deliberate. “They’re just waiting for you to slip. For the day you stop pretending. Then they’ll put you down like the rest of us.”

I clenched my teeth. “I’m not like you.”

A beat of silence.

Then, the Revenant spoke—low, quiet, almost pitying.

“…Then why are you afraid?”

I pulled the trigger.

The first shot hit center mass. The Revenant staggered but didn’t fall.

The second shot took it in the shoulder.

It growled—a deep, inhuman sound—but still, it smiled.

“There he is,” it murmured. “The real you.”

I didn’t stop.

I emptied the clip, every shot tearing through its shifting, unnatural flesh. It twitched. Jerked. But it didn’t fall.

I reached for my sidearm, but it was already moving.

One second, it was across the room. The next, it was in my face.

A hand—too strong, too fast—closed around my throat.

And for the first time in years, I felt weak.

It lifted me off the ground like I weighed nothing. My fingers scrabbled against its grip, my legs kicking, lungs burning. I brought my knee up, aiming for its ribs, but it barely reacted.

Its face was close now, those unnatural eyes boring into mine.

“You feel it, don’t you?” it whispered.

My vision blurred at the edges.

“That thing inside you?”

Darkness pressed in.

“It’s waking up.”

Then—gunfire.

A single, deafening shot.

The Revenant’s grip loosened.

I hit the ground, gasping.

Through the haze, I saw it staggering back.

A hole had been punched clean through its skull

It didn’t die right away. Its head snapped backward at an impossible angle, a deep, sickening gurgle escaping its throat. The hole where its brain should’ve been bubbled, dark fluid seeping out in sluggish rivers. It swayed, twitching like a dying insect, fingers curling in on themselves as if trying to hold onto something unseen. And then, finally, it fell.

And standing behind it—pistol raised—was Director Carter.

The Revenant tried to speak, but all that came out was a wet, gurgling choke.

Then, slowly, it collapsed.

Its body convulsed once. Then twice.

Then it stopped moving.

The room fell into silence, broken only by the distant whir of approaching helicopters.

I pushed myself up, still dazed, throat raw. Carter lowered his weapon, studying the corpse like it was nothing more than an old experiment finally put down.

“Didn’t think you’d need backup,” he said.

I wiped blood from my mouth. “I had it under control.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Did you?”

I said nothing.

Because the truth was, I wasn’t sure.

Carter holstered his gun, turning toward the door as the first wave of Division operatives flooded in.

“Clean this up,” he ordered. “Burn it.”

I watched as they moved in, securing the scene, already treating the Revenant like it had never even existed.

Like it was never human.

And maybe it wasn’t.

Maybe it was just another monster. Another target. Another mission.

So why couldn’t I shake the feeling that it was right?

I was debriefed. The mission was labeled a success.

Carter didn’t ask what the Revenant said to me.

I didn’t tell him I found the file.

But later that night, when I stripped off my gear and looked at myself in the mirror, I saw something I hadn’t noticed before.

The bruises on my throat were already fading.

The pain was already gone.

Faster than it should’ve been.

I flexed my fingers, watching the veins beneath my skin.

I wasn’t like them.

I was still human.

The moment I walked into Carter’s office, I knew I wasn’t leaving as the same man.

Maybe I wasn’t leaving at all.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting long shadows across the polished steel walls. Carter sat behind his desk, fingers steepled, his expression unreadable. A thick folder rested in front of him, its edges crisp, its contents classified.

He didn’t even look up when I threw another folder onto his desk.

This one was mine.

“You had him killed.” My voice was even, controlled—but beneath it, something inside me was boiling.

Carter finally glanced at the folder. Flipped it open like he already knew what was inside.

The Wendigo Survivor Report.

A man—mid-forties, off-the-grid type—stumbled out of the Montana wilderness, frostbitten and starved but alive. He should’ve died. Hell, by all accounts, he did die. But something brought him back.

And the last thing he saw before escaping?

Me.

A Division cleanup team was sent in within hours. The official report said he died from “exposure-related complications.” The truth?

They put a bullet in his skull for seeing too much.

Carter sighed, rubbing his temple like I was a kid throwing a tantrum. “You should’ve left this alone.”

I clenched my fists. Felt my veins pulse. “He survived. That should’ve been enough.”

Carter finally looked at me. And for the first time, I realized he wasn’t just my handler.

He was my predecessor.

The first Revenant.

“You don’t get it, do you?” He leaned forward, voice calm. Patient. Like he was explaining something simple to a child. “We don’t leave loose ends. He saw something that shouldn’t exist. Something that could’ve unraveled everything we’ve worked for.”

I shook my head. “You mean me.”

Carter’s expression didn’t change. “You were never meant to be the hero, 18 C. You were meant to be a weapon. But weapons don’t ask questions. They don’t hesitate. They don’t come marching into their handler’s office demanding justice.”

I swallowed the bitter taste in my mouth. Hesitated.

Carter caught it. And for the first time, his mask slipped.

He smiled.

“That’s why you’re a liability.”

The room exploded into motion.

The air rippled around him as he lunged, and for a brief second, I saw what was beneath—his skin flickered, translucent, veins thick and pulsing with something black. His pupils dilated too wide, too deep, until they were nothing but voids swallowing the whites of his eyes. When he spoke, his voice echoed—not just one voice, but many.

The first bullet missed my head by an inch.

The second tore through my side.

Pain flared hot and sharp, but my body was already healing. Not fast enough. Not yet.

I hit the ground, rolled, grabbed the closest thing I could—a chair.

I threw it.

Not at Carter, but at the lights.

Glass shattered. The room plunged into flickering darkness. Shadows stretched and warped.

Carter laughed, stepping forward. “You think that’ll save you?”

I clenched my jaw. “No.”

“But it’ll slow you down.”

I lunged.

Carter met me in the middle. Fist to fist. Bone to bone.

I don’t know how long we fought. Seconds. Minutes. Forever. He was stronger. More experienced. But I was angrier.

And that made me reckless.

He drove an elbow into my ribs, cracking something. I staggered back, vision swimming.

“You don’t get it,” he said, breath steady. “You and I? We aren’t human anymore. We never were.”

I spit blood onto the floor. “Speak for yourself.”

Carter tilted his head. “Then why are you still healing, why are you stronger than everyone around you?”

I didn’t answer.

Because we both knew the truth.

I wasn’t normal. Not anymore.

And the longer I stayed here, the longer I let The Division pull the strings, the closer I came to becoming something else.
I needed to go. Now.

Carter saw the shift in my stance. “You can’t outrun this.”

I exhaled. “Watch me.”

Then I turned and ran.

The diner was quiet.

A shitty little roadside place, barely a blip on the map. The kind of spot where people didn’t ask questions.

I sat in the back booth, hoodie pulled low, blood seeping through my makeshift bandages.

But they weren’t healing right. The skin around them crawled, like something beneath the surface was knitting me back together too fast, too eagerly. The flesh looked fresh, but it wasn’t mine—it felt alien, tight and stretched like a poorly-fitted mask.

Across from me, the waitress was watching.

She was young—early twenties, auburn hair pulled into a messy bun, tired eyes that had seen too much. She hadn’t said much since she found me slumped against the booth, barely conscious.

Just patched me up. Poured me coffee.

Now, she studied me with quiet curiosity.

“You wanna tell me what happened to you?” she finally asked.

I wrapped my fingers around the mug, feeling the heat against my skin. “No.”

She smirked. “Figures.”

A pause.

Then—softer— “You running from something?”

I didn’t look up. “Yeah.”

She nodded, like she already knew the answer. “You got a plan?”

I exhaled slowly.

I had nothing.

No contacts. No allies. No idea what came next.

But I still had one advantage.

Carter thought I was just another rogue asset. A failed experiment running on borrowed time.

He didn’t know what I knew.

That whatever was inside me? It was still waking up.

And when it did?

I was going to burn The Division to the ground.

The waitress refilled my cup, watching me carefully. “Well,” she said, “if you need a place to lay low… you’re not the first guy to come through here looking like hell.”

I studied her. “Why help me?”

She shrugged. “You remind me of my brother.”

Something twisted in my chest.

I nodded. Took a slow sip of coffee.

For now, I’d lay low.

But soon?

I’d go back into the dark.

And this time, I wouldn’t be hunting for The Division.

I flexed my fingers against the coffee cup. For a second, the skin rippled. Shifted. Like it wasn’t quite settled into the right shape. I forced it back down, clenching my fist. Not yet. But soon.

I’d be hunting them.

Roommate keeps blasting my TV at night, never  cleans up after himself —what can I do?

I’m at my breaking point with my roommate. I bought a TV for our apartment, and every night he blasts it while I’m trying to sleep. I’ve asked him multiple times to turn it down—sometimes he lowers it slightly but within minutes, he cranks it back up again. It’s been affecting my sleep and honestly, my sanity.

On top of that, he’s a total slob. Our parents helped us clean when we first moved in, but within days, the place would be trashed again. I even paid for a maid out of my own pocket just to get things back to normal. It’s been two days since that cleaning, and I already know the cycle is about to repeat.

 he’s really stubborn about all of his ways . The issue is, we have so many mutual friends, and i don’t think  snitching to the RA would be beneficial for anyone in this situation .  I’m the only one putting in any effort while he just does whatever he wants. He’s a nice person otherwise  , but he  has some laziness issue  where he prefers everything be   filthy .( for example smoking cigs inside apartment and collecting the ash in our coffee mugs. He had a whole panic episode when he figured out the maid cleaned the mug.)

He watched the series as it aired but only once, yet he never stopped referencing it or talking about it.

I, on the other hand, had never seen it. When it first aired, I was 14 and too scared to watch anything remotely spooky (funny how things change because now I love all things horror and paranormal!).

Last June, after years of hearing my husband mention SPN, I finally decided—enough was enough. If this show meant so much to him, I needed to see why. And, of course, I completely fell in love with the series, the characters, and the fandom!

Fast forward to January of this year: our local tattoo artist (who only opens his books every six months) announced new appointments. Without hesitation, we booked a session for matching anti-possession tattoos. Our appointment? March 1st—completely unaware that it also happens to be Jensen Ackles’ birthday!

Around the same time, we realized that if we timed it right, we could watch the Supernatural series finale on the same day as our tattoo session. So today, we woke up, had coffee, watched episodes 17 and 18, got our tattoos, came home, poured some wine, and finished the last two episodes.

And yes, I cried like a baby.

So now, not only am I a die-hard SPN fan, but I also have a matching tattoo with my husband, gotten on Jensen’s birthday—the same day I watched Cass' big moment and experienced the finale for the first time.

CHARLOTTE RUSSELL 

Alan was born in the sweltering heat of July, screaming his way into the world like he had been fighting to get here all along.

The nurses cooed over him, over his full head of dark blond hair, over the way his tiny fingers curled into fists, ready to swing at anything that dared come too close. But it was Arvin who truly beamed, his face aglow with something I had never seen before—not just joy, not just pride, but something deeper, something that settled into his bones the moment he laid eyes on our son.

The moment they placed Alan in his arms, Arvin held him like he was the most fragile thing in existence, like the weight of him alone was enough to make the whole world stop spinning.

“Hey there, little man,” he murmured, his voice cracking, his thumb brushing over the soft, wrinkled skin of Alan’s tiny hand. “Look at you. Look at you.”

Alan hiccupped, nose scrunching up, his newborn eyes barely able to focus. But his little fingers stretched, grasping for something, and when they latched onto Arvin’s thumb, his father let out a breathless, disbelieving laugh.

“You got a strong grip already,” he whispered. “Just like your old man.”

I watched them from my hospital bed, exhaustion pressing heavy on my limbs, my body sore and aching, but I didn’t care.

I watched Arvin cradle our son, press a reverent kiss to his forehead, rock him gently even when Alan had already started to drift off, safe and warm in his father’s arms. I watched my husband become a father, watched him change in real time, watched something in him settle, become more than it was before.

He loved Alan, completely, wholly, without question.

And it broke me, because it was then that I knew.

I knew that if I told him, if I told him what I had done, if I told him the price I had paid to bring our son into this world, I would shatter that love in an instant.

So I kept my mouth shut.

For weeks, I said nothing.

I let Arvin believe that Alan was a miracle, that he was a gift from God, that he was the answer to every prayer we had ever whispered into the dark. I let him hold our boy close, let him whisper promises of protection, let him trace his tiny features with gentle fingers, memorizing every inch of the life we had created.

And I burned with guilt.

Every night, as I lay awake listening to Alan’s soft breaths in his bassinet, I felt it gnawing at me, a slow, relentless hunger that would not be sated.

Until one night, when I couldn’t take it anymore.

Arvin was asleep beside me, one arm draped protectively over my waist, his face slack with the rare peace that only came with exhaustion. I turned to him, watched the steady rise and fall of his chest, listened to the soft hum of his breathing.

And then, barely above a whisper—

“Arvin,” I said.

He stirred slightly, brow furrowing.

I swallowed, my mouth dry. “Wake up.”

His eyes opened instantly, like he had never truly been asleep at all. His instincts, sharpened by war, by something deeper, always kept him on edge.

He blinked at me, sleepy but aware. “What’s wrong?”

I hesitated, suddenly unsure if I could go through with it.

But then I looked at Alan, our son, sleeping so peacefully in his crib.

And I told him everything.

I told him about the loneliness, the darkness that had swallowed me whole while he was gone. I told him about the nights I spent wandering the places we had once walked together, trying to find some piece of him in the empty spaces he left behind.

And I told him about the man in the tweed suit.

I told him how he had found me by the railroad tracks, how he had spoken to me like an old friend, how I had been so desperate, so hollow, that I hadn’t questioned it.

I told him what I had done.

What I had given.

Arvin didn’t move, didn’t speak, didn’t breathe.

His face was still, his jaw clenched so tight I thought it might snap. When he finally exhaled, it was slow. Controlled. His eyes met mine in the dim light, and for the first time in our lives, I couldn’t read him.

“You made a deal,” he said, voice low.

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak.

“And the price,” he murmured, his gaze flickering to Alan, still fast asleep. “It’s him, isn’t it?”

Tears welled in my eyes. “Arvin, I didn’t—”

But he was already sitting up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed.

“Arvin—”

He stood, running a hand over his face, and for a moment, I thought he might leave. That he might walk out the door and never come back.

But he didn’t.

He turned, walked over to the nightstand, and opened the drawer. Then he pulled out the Tokarev.

I stared. “Arvin, what—”

He checked the magazine, then tucked the gun into the waistband of his pants, right at the small of his back.

He turned back to me, his face unreadable.

“Why do you think I came back like this?” he said quietly.

I frowned. “Like what?”

He exhaled, shaking his head. “I didn’t just find God over there, Charlotte. I found something else too. Something dark. Something that don’t bleed.” His eyes flickered to Alan again. “And now it’s come for our son.”

A chill ran down my spine.

“I won’t let it take him,” he said.

His voice was steady, unwavering.

“I don’t care if it’s a demon. I don’t care if it’s the devil himself.” His hand rested against the gun at his back, his fingers flexing. “It ain’t gettin’ past me.”

I let out a shaky breath, my heart pounding.

“You believe me?” I whispered.

Arvin looked at me then, and I knew—I knew he had seen things worse than I ever could have imagined.

“I believe you,” he said simply.

And from that night on, he changed.

He never left the house unarmed. He spent nights at the kitchen table, reading through books I had never seen before—books on exorcisms, on demonic lore, on the ways men had tried to fight the darkness since the dawn of time.

He walked the perimeter of our home at night, muttering prayers under his breath, his hand never far from his gun.

And when Alan took his first steps, when he spoke his first words, when he laughed for the very first time—

Arvin held him close, kissed the top of his head, and whispered, “You ain’t gonna take him. You hear me? You ain’t gonna take my son.”

I watched him from the doorway, my heart heavy with love and with guilt.

Because no matter how much Arvin prayed, no matter how much he prepared—

I knew.

I knew that one day, the devil would come to collect.



It started with a knock.

Soft, polite, like any other visitor coming to call.

I was in the kitchen, bouncing Alan in my arms, his tiny face nuzzled against my shoulder. The rocking motion had lulled him into that half-sleep where his breathing was slow and steady, his little fingers twitching against the fabric of my dress. Arvin was at the table, flipping through one of his books, the pages brittle and yellowed with age. He had found it in an old second-hand shop outside of Baton Rouge, a leather-bound thing filled with dense Latin script and hand-drawn sigils.

At first, neither of us thought much of the knock.

But then it came again, slow and measured. Arvin’s head snapped up. I turned toward the door, a strange, cold weight settling in my stomach. Something was wrong. I didn’t know how I knew, but I did. It was a feeling, deep in my bones, deep in the marrow.

Another knock, a polite rhythm, waiting patiently for an answer. 

Alan stirred in my arms, his tiny body tensing. Arvin stood up, moving slowly, carefully, like he was afraid of making too much noise.

“Charlotte,” he said, his voice low, measured. “Take the baby.”

My grip tightened instinctively.

Another knock.

Arvin moved toward the door, reaching for his gun, the Tokarev glinting in the dim light of the kitchen. He looked at me once, just for a second, then he reached for the knob.

“Wait,” I whispered.

But it was too late.

The door swung open—and there he was.

The man in the tweed suit, standing just beyond the threshold, his hands folded neatly in front of him, the brim of his hat casting a shadow over his face, yet somehow I knew his eyes were locked on Alan.

“Evening,” he said, voice warm, almost pleasant. “Mighty fine night, isn’t it?”

My breath hitched in my throat. Arvin didn’t say a word.

The man smiled. Not wide, not forced—just an easy, practiced thing, the kind you give to an old friend on a Sunday afternoon.

“Now,” he said, tilting his head ever so slightly. “Don’t be rude. Aren’t you gonna invite me in?”

The words sent ice down my spine. I took a step back, clutching Alan close. His tiny body was warm against mine, but he was tense now, his breath coming in short, uneasy bursts.

Arvin’s grip tightened around the gun.

“Go to hell,” he said.

The man in the tweed suit exhaled through his nose, a quiet, almost amused sound.

“You know,” he said, “most people don’t realize how old the rules are. Not just any house, mind you. No, no—only a home.” His smile widened, showing just the barest hint of teeth. “Homes have power, don’t they? But only if you keep them pure. Only if you keep them whole.”

His eyes flickered past Arvin, to me, to Alan.

“Shame about that, though.” His voice dipped lower, softer, just for me. “A home built on a lie? Well. That ain’t much of a home at all, now is it?”

Arvin slammed the door, locked it, bolted it. Then he grabbed the curtains, yanking them shut, pulling every shade in the house, making sure there wasn’t a sliver of moonlight left to filter through.

And still—the knocking.

Not just at the door anymore, but at the windows, at the back porch, on the walls.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Soft. Gentle. Unrelenting.

Arvin grabbed the book from the table, flipping through the pages so fast I thought they might tear. Alan whimpered in my arms, pressing his face against my chest, his little fingers curling into the fabric of my dress.

A voice—low, smooth, bleeding through the walls.

“Charlotte, Charlotte, Charlotte,” he murmured, like a song, like a prayer. “Let me in. Don’t make me wait.”

I squeezed my eyes shut, shaking.

“Charlotte,” Arvin barked. “Get in the bedroom. Now.”

I didn’t argue, I just ran towards the room, hearing Arvin’s voice, loud and deep, speaking in an ancient tongue I didn’t understand.

But the moment I stepped through the doorway, the crib shook, not just a tremor, but a violent, ear-splitting rattle.

Alan screamed.

And then there was silence. I turned, my breath caught in my throat. Arvin was still at the table, one hand gripping the book, the other gripping his gun.

The house was still, no knocking, no tapping, no voice.

Just the heavy weight of something unseen, thick and pressing against the walls.

Arvin didn’t speak for a moment, before he finally took a deep breath.

“He’s gone,” he muttered.

I didn’t believe him, not at first. But the night stretched on, and the knocking didn’t return.

Still, I didn’t sleep and neither did Arvin.

By morning, we knew we couldn’t stay. We left Ashwood before the week was over.

At first, it was just a temporary thing. Just a little trip, a little space to clear our heads, but we never went back. We packed what we could, loaded up the car, and left the rest behind. Arvin built us a new home, with his own hands, just like before. But the man in the tweed suit found us again.

So we moved.

And we moved.

And we moved.

No matter where we went, he always found us.

Sometimes, I’d see him standing at a bus stop, reading a paper.

Other times, he’d be sitting in a diner, stirring sugar into his coffee.

Always watching.

Always waiting.

The knocks would always come, eventually.

Soft. Gentle. Patient.

Alan grew up in motion, never staying in one place for long, never settling.

He didn’t know why, didn’t know what followed us, didn’t know the price that had been paid for his life.

And I prayed—oh, how I prayed—that he would never have to.


The answer came to me one day, starting with a memory, not a clear one, not at first. Just a whisper of something old, something half-forgotten, curling around the edges of my mind like smoke.

I was scrubbing the sink when it came—hot water running over my hands, the soap foaming thick and white against the porcelain. I had been staring at nothing, my thoughts drifting, when suddenly I was young again, sitting on the porch steps with my mother, listening to the cicadas hum in the trees.

I gripped the edge of the sink, the memory coming sharper, clearer, the words sinking deep into the marrow of me.

The Phoenician Grove.

The name was an old one, a secret one. The kind of thing people only spoke about in whispers, the kind of thing that made good men cross themselves and bad men smirk like they knew something you didn’t.

I had never seen it with my own eyes, but I had heard the stories. Men who had reversed their deals, men who had traded their souls away and won them back through penance, through ritual, through service.

I thought of the man in the tweed suit.

I thought of the knocks at the door.

I thought of Alan, small and soft in my arms, his breath warm against my skin, his tiny fingers curling around mine.

And I knew I couldn’t run forever, I had to go back.

I didn’t tell Arvin the truth, not all of it anyway. I told him that I was tired of moving. That I wanted to go home, back to Ashwood, back to something familiar.

He didn’t argue. He never did, not when it came to me.

He only nodded, rubbing a hand over his jaw, his thumb tracing the scar beneath his chin, the one he had gotten in Vietnam.

“If that’s what you want,” he murmured, “then that’s what we’ll do.”

And just like that, the decision was made.

It took time, more than I thought it would.

Arvin worked himself raw, taking on whatever jobs he could find, his hands always stained with sawdust, his shoulders always aching. I watched him from the doorway some nights, watched him sitting at the kitchen table, rubbing his temples, the callouses on his fingers catching the light.

“I can work too,” I told him once.

He just shook his head.

“I got it,” he said, firm but gentle. “I’ll take care of it.”

And he did. 

I don’t know how, not really. But somehow, some way, he made it happen.

One evening, he came home, his face weary but triumphant, and set a folded piece of paper on the table.

“Deed’s ours,” he said simply.

And just like that—we had a home again.

My childhood home. The same walls, the same floors, the same creaking front steps where I had once sat, bare-kneed and laughing, before life had sunk its claws into me. 

We moved back in the fall.

It looked smaller than I remembered. The white paint had yellowed in the years I had been gone, the front steps sagging under their own weight, the porch light barely flickering against the early evening haze.

Alan had pressed his face against the window as we pulled up to the house, his breath fogging the glass, his blue eyes wide with something close to wonder.

I didn’t get out of the car right away.

I just sat there, hands curled around the steering wheel, staring at the house that had once been mine.

The same walls that had once held my childhood laughter. The same rooms where I had dreamed of growing old with Arvin.

The same place I had run from. The same place I had come back to.

Alan turned, looking at me through the rearview mirror, his small brow creased. Arvin kissed me on the cheek, reassuringly. Alan followed him up the steps of the house, scampering up them like an eager gerbil.

For a while, things were good.

Better than I thought they would be.

Alan found friends—Mac and Don, Kevin and Heather. I would watch them from the window sometimes, running wild through the streets, their laughter carrying through the dusk like a hymn.

Arvin found steady work, his hands forever stained with sawdust, his shirts smelling like fresh pine and sweat.

And I—I found my way to the Phoenician Grove.

It was easier than I had expected. There were people who knew, people who saw me walking through town with my eyes drawn to the ground, with my shoulders tight with the weight of a thousand silent sins.

They had approached me in quiet places, in back pews and empty aisles, with voices low and knowing. They had welcomed me in and for the first time in years, I felt something close to hope.

The ceremonies were solemn and holy, with a touch of fire and brimstone, of blood spilled on the altar while voices raised in reverence, in worship, in penance.

But I felt clean for the first time since that day by the railroad tracks. For the first time since I had sat across from a man in a tweed suit and traded away my son’s soul for my own selfish longing.

And for a while I let myself believe that it was over.

That I had done what needed to be done, saved Alan, saved myself.

But salvation comes at a cost.

And mine—my cost was Arvin.

I never told him where I went at night and he never asked, but I saw the way he watched me. I saw the way he clenched his jaw when he woke to an empty bed. I saw the way his eyes darkened, the way his hands curled into fists when he thought I wasn’t looking.

And I let it happen, I let him believe whatever it was he needed to believe.

Because the truth—the truth was worse.

So I stayed silent and he did too. Slowly, night by night, we unraveled. We stopped laughing as much, stopped touching as much. He stopped looking at me the way he used to, like I was something precious, something holy.

One night, I found him sitting at the kitchen table, a half-empty glass of whiskey in his hand, his Tokarev resting on the wood beside him.

He didn’t look at me when I walked in, didn’t say anything. He just took a slow sip, eyes fixed on something I couldn’t see. I swallowed hard, my fingers curling against my nightgown.

“Arvin,” I murmured.

Nothing.

Just the quiet clink of ice shifting in the glass.

I stepped forward.

“I—”

I stopped.

Because what could I say?

What could I possibly say that they wouldn’t kill him for knowing?

So I didn’t say anything. I just stood there, in the dim glow of the kitchen light, watching the man I loved slip further and further away.

And I knew.

I knew I had already lost him.

I had let my penance become my prison.

I had let my salvation become my sin.

And I watched as the man I loved—the man who had held me through my worst nights, the man who had pressed his forehead to mine and whispered, You are everything, Charlotte, you are my whole damn world—

Became a stranger.

And when I looked in the mirror—so had I.



Arvin had always been sharp, always been observant.

But something about this place—it gnawed at him, stuck in his ribs like an old wound that wouldn’t quite heal.

“I don’t like this town,” he told me one night, his voice low, his fingers tapping idly against the rim of his coffee mug. “Something’s wrong here.”

I forced a smile, tracing slow circles along the wood grain of the kitchen table. “You’re just not used to being in one place for too long.”

He didn’t smile back.

“I mean it, Charlotte,” he said, eyes dark with something I couldn’t name. “There’s something under this place. Something no one’s talkin’ about.”

A lump formed in my throat. 

I swallowed it down.

“You’re overthinking things.”

But he wasn’t, not this time. Because over the next few months, I watched it happen. I watched as the town sank its teeth into him, as he dug his fingers into the rot beneath its surface and came away bloody.

It started with the fracking sites.

“They’re not just drilling for oil,” he told me one night, his voice tight with frustration, his hands rough with the day’s labor. “They’re digging deeper. Building things down there. I don’t know what for, but it ain’t for fracking.”

I didn’t ask how he knew, didn’t want to know. Didn’t want to hear about the things he had seen, the things that kept him up at night.

Because if I heard them—I’d have to pretend I didn’t already know.

Arvin never stopped. Even when the walls started closing in, even when people started watching him, he never stopped asking questions. He never stopped talking about the governor and his wife, about the way they ran this town like it was theirs alone.

“They know I’m onto them,” he told me once, standing in the doorway of our bedroom, his silhouette dark against the hallway light. “I see it in their faces.”

I clenched my hands together beneath the sheets.

“I don’t know what you want me to say, Arvin.”

He exhaled sharply, running a hand through his graying hair.

“I just—” His voice faltered, and for a moment, just a moment, he looked tired. “I just don’t want Alan growin’ up in this.”

I turned my head, staring up at the ceiling.

Me neither.

But I had already made my choice and the night before he died, I chose again.

It wasn’t an easy decision.

Even now, I like to tell myself that I wrestled with it, that I sat awake in the dark, turning it over in my mind, that I prayed, that I begged, that I wept.

But the truth—the truth is, when the time came—I did not hesitate.

And maybe that—more than anything else—is my greatest sin.

I did not weep, I did not beg, I did not look up at the ceiling and whisper forgive me, forgive me, forgive me.

I simply told them what I knew; that he was close, that he would not stop. 

That I could not change his mind and they handled the rest.

The morning of his accident, he kissed me goodbye, told me he loved me.

I let him walk out that door, I let him drive to work. I let him climb down into the belly of this town’s sickness and never climb back out. 

I stood next to Alan at his funeral, my son’s small fingers curled in mine, and I let myself cry.

And for the first time since I sat at that table by the railroad tracks—

I felt nothing at all.



I remember it well.

I remember that night in the pines, how cold the biting wind was, threatening to blow out our torches as we knelt before the great owl. I remember the sound of their fleeing feet, filled with the terror of a child convinced he had seen something lurking in the dark corridor.

I could still hear their ragged breaths, the crunch of leaves beneath their stumbling feet, but I did not look back. I did not need to. They were following, as they had followed me since childhood, since the days when their laughter filled my kitchen, when their muddy footprints trailed across my floors. They had been boys, then. Barefoot in the summer, sticky-fingered from stolen peaches, fearless in the way that only children could be.

But childhood had ended.

And I had marched them into the dark.

Don had fought. Of course he had fought. He had always been the strong one, the stubborn one. It had taken everything in me to wrestle the shotgun from his grasp, the same shotgun I had once seen slung over his father’s shoulder when he came to pick him up from school.

It felt so much heavier now.

Kevin’s red jacket caught the moonlight as he stumbled, the fabric tearing on a gnarled branch, a strip of it fluttering like a wounded flag. The sound of his breathing was sharp, uneven, ragged. Don’s was heavier, angrier. He did not beg. Neither of them did.

The trees stretched high above us, skeletal limbs clawing at the sky, black against the deep, yawning mouth of night. The wind whispered through the pines, a shivering breath that sent the leaves dancing in frantic, voiceless pleas. The path wound downward, sloping toward the tracks, the wooden ties stretching long and unbroken beneath the moon’s pale light. A straight line. A direction. An answer.

And there—just beyond the bend—he was waiting.

The man in the tweed suit.

Seated on the rails, legs crossed at the knee, hands folded neatly in his lap. His hat was tilted forward just enough to cast his face in shadow, but I knew what lay beneath. I had traced the lines of his face in my mind a hundred times. The sharp angles, the knowing smile, too wide for his face. The eyes that were never quite the same color twice.

He did not move.

He did not speak.

He was only watching.

My breath curled in the cold, a white plume rising toward the sky, dissolving into nothing.

I tightened my grip on the shotgun.

The boys knelt before me, their backs bowed beneath the weight of inevitability. I could feel them trembling, the air thick with their silent prayers.

I could not let them live, not now, not after this.

The trees held their breath. The wind stilled. Even the earth seemed to pause, waiting, listening.

I raised the gun.

Don was first.

The first shot shattered the night. A violent crack that split through the silence like lightning through a dead sky, ripping through his back, his body lurching forward before crumpling against the steel. The blood came fast, a thick, dark pool spilling out, steam curling where it met the frozen air.

Kevin let out a strangled noise, something between a gasp and a sob, his fingers clawing at the ground, his body fighting what his mind already knew was coming.

I chambered another round.

The wind howled.

The second shot split the world apart.

Kevin’s body spasmed, his jacket blooming dark, his breath leaving him in a single, broken exhale. His fingers twitched once, twice, then stilled.

The man in the tweed suit tilted his head.

And when it was done, when the smoke curled soft and whispering from the barrel, I let the gun fall to my side, landing in the gravel with a muted thud.

The man on the tracks was gone.

The place where he sat was empty, the steel rails humming faintly beneath the wind’s return.

I stared at the space he had occupied, searching the darkness for something—some sign, some confirmation, some whisper of his approval.

After all, two souls for one was more than fair.

But there was nothing, only the soft, rhythmic ticking of my own pulse, steady, unbroken. The bodies lay motionless before me, their blood sinking into the earth, their faces turned toward the stars, unblinking, unseeing.

The tracks stretched on before me, disappearing into the endless dark.

The night had swallowed the gunshots quickly, hungrily, like it had been waiting for them. The echoes barely had time to settle before I heard the familiar growl of tires crunching over the gravel. Headlights cut through the trees, slicing long, pale beams through the tangled branches, bathing the carnage in cold fluorescence.

Sheriff Wilkes pulled up slowly, like he was arriving at an old friend’s house for supper. The red and blue of his cruiser lights spun lazily against the darkness, painting the blood-soaked tracks in dizzying flashes of color.

He stepped out, boots landing heavy against the dirt.

The warmth in his face hadn’t faded, the easy smile, the fatherly concern—still there.

The kind man I had known for years, who had pulled me over once and let me off with a warning when I was driving too fast in the rain.

And yet—his eyes.

His eyes were on the blood. Not the bodies, not me.

The blood.

The way it soaked into the gravel, into the frozen soil. The way it steamed in the cold air. His fingers twitched at his sides, flexing once before curling into loose fists. For a moment, his lips parted—just slightly, just enough for something breathless to escape him, a sound too soft to name.

And then, just as quickly, it was gone.

The mask slipped back into place.

He turned to me, tilting his hat back slightly.

“Well,” he said, his voice as easy as ever. “That’s a hell of a mess you made, Miss Russell.”

I swallowed, the weight of the gun still lingering in my fingers, ghostly, phantom-like.

“I—”

“Now, now.” He tutted softly, stepping closer. “Ain’t no need for all that. You did what you had to do.”

His gaze flicked back to the boys, their bodies pale beneath the wash of headlights, the dark pools beneath them spreading, slow and patient.

“Can’t have folks pokin’ their noses where they don’t belong,” he murmured, more to himself than to me.

He crouched then, retrieving the blue tarp from the trunk of his cruiser, his movements practiced, smooth. Not the first time, not by a long shot. 

My stomach twisted.

He worked efficiently, draping the heavy plastic over their bodies, tucking them away like he was swaddling sleeping children. His hands were steady, sure.

When he was done, he stood, brushing the dirt from his knees, turning back to me with that same, soft expression.

“Medical examiner will take care of the rest,” he assured me. “We’ll keep it quiet.”

I nodded numbly. Wilkes reached out, resting a hand on my shoulder.

“You did right by us, Charlotte,” he said, squeezing gently. “Did what needed to be done. And we take care of our own.”

His words were meant to be reassuring, comforting, his hand resting just a second too long, the warmth of it seeping through my coat, into my skin.

I thought of Arvin.

I thought of Alan.

I thought of the way Wilkes’ gaze had lingered on the blood, reverent, almost worshipful.

I thought of the man in the tweed suit, waiting, watching.

I had done what I needed to do.


The kitchen was unbearably still. 

The air was thick, heavy with the weight of words that I could never take back. The kitchen was quiet, but I could hear the blood roaring in my ears, pounding against my skull in a rhythm I no longer recognized as my own. The air felt thick, the kind of heavy that settles before a storm, pressing in against my skin, filling my lungs like smoke. My son stood across from me, his breath coming hard and fast, his father’s gun in his hand, his knuckles bone-white around the grip.

Alan.

My beautiful boy.

He looked just like Arvin, but not in the way people would think. Not in the shape of his jaw or the cut of his features, but in the way he carried himself, the way he squared his shoulders as though bracing for war. The way he looked at me now, eyes burning with something so much deeper than anger. His eyes—the same sharp, knowing eyes Arvin had once had—were locked on me, and in them, I saw it. 

Revulsion. Horror. Hatred.

I had never seen him like this.

I had seen my son angry before—tantrums when he was small, quiet simmering rage as he got older, the occasional flash of fire in his eyes when he argued with his friends. But this? This wasn’t anger.

This was betrayal.

The truth had settled into his bones now, wrapping itself around him like an iron chain. I had carried that weight for so long, bore it alone in the quiet of midnight ceremonies, in the blood that soaked into the earth, in the hollow space beside me where Arvin used to sleep.

And now, finally, Alan carried it too.

“You had my father killed,” he whispered, his voice raw, hoarse, like the words themselves were burning his throat on the way out.

His voice cracked on the last word, the sound of it carving through me, cleaving through bone and marrow. I swallowed against the weight in my throat, but the words wouldn’t come.

“You shot Kevin.” His breath hitched. “You shot Don.”

His hands trembled, not from weakness but from restraint.

“You fucking executed them.”

The gun twitched in his grip, the barrel still aimed at the floor, but close, too close, his body vibrating with the kind of tension that could snap in an instant. I exhaled slowly, steadily, the way I always had. The way I did when Alan was a baby, when he would cry in the middle of the night and I would rock him, shushing him, whispering that everything was going to be alright.

Because it was. I had made it alright. I had saved him.

“I was protecting you.”

His face twisted, something ugly flashing through his features. “Protecting me?” he echoed.

“You don’t understand,” I said softly.

“Then make me,” he snapped. “Make me understand how you could do this. How you could—” He exhaled sharply, voice shaking. “How you could kill them. How you could stand over Kevin and Don and pull the trigger.”

The memory burned at the edges of my mind—Kevin’s wide, terrified eyes, Don’s shaking hands, the sound of their bodies hitting the tracks. The silence that followed.
The life of two boys—boys who would have never made it out of this town, who would have been swallowed up in something else, something worse—was a small price to pay.

Arvin had been harder. I had mourned him.

I had sat beside Alan, his tiny hands clutching mine, and cried real, stinging tears.

But he was going to ruin everything. 

He was going to take Alan from me.

I couldn’t let him do that.

I stepped forward placatingly, my arms outstretched.

He flinched.

It was the first time he had ever flinched from me, and the knowledge of it sent something cold curling around my ribs, pressing into my lungs.

His breath came faster, shallower, and I watched his body lock up, his mind trying to pull apart the pieces, trying to fit them into something that made sense, something that wasn’t this.

I let my mouth spread open in a wide smile, tears burning hot down my cheeks, but I barely felt them, barely registered anything beyond the way my boy looked at me, the way the world narrowed down to this single moment, this sliver of time where I could reach him, where I could make him understand.

“You don’t understand,” I murmured.

Tears blurred my vision, but I could still see him, still see the sharp set of his jaw, the fire in his eyes, the battle waging inside of him.

I had seen that same look before on his father’s face. On Arvin, when I had told him the truth all those years ago, when I had broken something sacred between us, something that could never be fixed. And now here I was again, standing across from another man I loved more than life itself, and watching him hate me.

But it didn’t matter, none of it mattered.

Because I had made my choice a long time ago.

The moment I signed his soul away on the tracks, the moment I sealed my fate, this was always going to be how it ended.

He didn’t understand, not now, not yet.

But he would.

One day, when he had a son of his own, when he felt the weight of fatherhood settle over him, when he understood what it meant to sacrifice, what it meant to carve open your own chest and bleed for your child, he would know. The blood had dried under my nails, sunk into my skin, darkened my soul.

But Alan was alive, he was safe.

Alan’s hand jerked up, the barrel of the gun rising with it, stopping just short of leveling with my head. His arms were steady now, his breath slow and deliberate.

My boy.

Arvin’s boy.

He was always going to be his father’s son.

I stared down the cold metal barrel, looking past it into the face of my son, born of blood and brimstone.

I smiled, letting the tears come. Letting the moment settle into me, deep into my marrow, because it was the truth.

It had always been the truth.

“I did it all for you.”

I saw the weight of my words hit him as he furrowed his brow, a fresh wave of pain coursing through him. I watched as he looked up at me with his tear-filled eyes, his finger twitching as he pulled the trigger of his father’s gun.

This Tik Tok is from a bit ago, but it shows a hoodie that is about coffee. Yes, it's cute, yes it's probably overpriced. I find it interesting that they are selling a hoodie about coffee when in their religion they can't drink it. I guess it's OK to promote it and make money about it though.",3,1740860526.0,NotEnoughNelsonsSnark,0,1.0,False

ALAN RUSSELL

The streets were quiet. Too quiet.

I stood there for a long moment, just outside my house, the air thick with the scent of pine and wet pavement, the kind of damp that clung to your skin and made the world feel smaller, heavier. The wind whispered through the trees, rattling brittle leaves against the pavement, but that wasn’t what made my skin crawl.

I wasn’t alone.

A prickle ran down the back of my neck, the unmistakable weight of a gaze pressing against me. I turned my head slowly, scanning the empty street, the darkened windows, the flickering street lamp on the corner. And then—

There.

A figure stood beneath the skeletal arms of the old elm at the end of the block, just beyond the reach of the light. He was tall, straight-backed, dressed in a tweed suit that looked like it belonged in another era. A hat cast his face into shadow, but even from here, I could see the unnatural stillness in the way he held himself, shoulders squared, hands resting stiffly at his sides. Not moving. Not shifting. Just watching.

His eyes were the only things that moved, flicking over me in a slow, measured sweep, taking me apart piece by piece.

I blinked.

He was gone. The wind picked up again, whistling low through the branches, but the street was empty, and the shadows held no shape. Nothing but darkness. Nothing but silence.

I swallowed hard, shaking off the unease curling deep in my gut. I moved like a shadow through the quiet streets, my breath tight in my chest as I neared the old house. The porch light was off, the windows dark, just as I’d hoped. I slipped through the side yard, past the rusting remnants of my father’s old tools—tools that would never again be lifted by the hands that built this house, hands that shaped my childhood. The thought sat heavy in my chest, but I pushed it down, focusing on the task at hand.

Carefully, quietly, I slipped open the door without a sound. Inside, the house smelled of dust and something faintly medicinal, the scent of a place left too long in silence. My eyes scanned the dimly lit living room, searching, and then—a stroke of luck. The camcorder sat right there on the coffee table, exactly where Mac had left it. Relief flooded through my body as I stepped forward, my fingers grazing the worn plastic surface. 

Then I heard it.

A soft shuffle. A shift in the air.

My instincts fired before my mind could catch up, my hand snapping to the worn grip of my Tokarev TT-33, the cold weight of the pistol a comfort even as adrenaline screamed through my veins. I turned sharply, gun raised, aimed squarely at the shadow in the hallway. 

And there she was—my mother.

The air left my lungs in a single sharp exhale, and I lowered the gun immediately, my heart hammering in my chest. 

""Holy shit, Mom—"" I began, but the words stuck in my throat. 

She stood still, just out of reach of the moonlight streaming through the blinds, her face unreadable, her posture unnervingly rigid. Something in the way she looked at me sent a shiver through my spine—not fear, not anger, but something deeper. A quiet knowing. A sadness so deep it seemed to stretch past the years.

""Alan,"" she said finally, her voice softer than I remembered, frayed at the edges.

I swallowed hard, trying to ease the dryness in my throat. ""I didn’t think you’d be home.""

A silence stretched between us, thick as molasses, as her gaze flicked to my father’s gun in my hand, then back to my face. 

""You shouldn’t be here,"" she murmured.

It was the way she said it, not scolding, not fearful, but resigned. As if she had expected this moment, as if she had known, deep down, that her son would come back through that door one last time. I felt a weight settle deep in my gut, an ache that had nothing to do with exhaustion. 


CHARLOTTE RUSSELL



Arvin Russell was the kind of man you built a life around.

He was solid, in that quiet, unshakable way that made the world seem smaller, safer. The kind of man who never had to raise his voice to be heard, who spoke with the conviction of someone who knew what was right and never strayed from it.

I fell in love with him the way young girls do—completely, hopelessly, all at once.

He was seventeen when I met him on the outskirts of Ashwood, just a boy in a white button-down, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, collar open to the sticky summer heat. His hair was sun-bleached at the tips from long afternoons working construction with his father, his skin warm from the day’s labor. He had rough hands and soft eyes, and when he looked at me, I felt like the prettiest girl in the whole damn county.

He was polite, the way boys from good homes were taught to be, but there was something else beneath that—something steadier. He didn’t look at other girls, didn’t chase skirts or pick fights to prove his worth. He was a hard worker, a church-going man, the kind who always remembered to take off his hat before he walked inside and never let a door close behind him without checking to see if someone was following.

I knew I was going to marry him before he ever kissed me.

That summer, we spent every free moment together, sneaking out to the creek after dark, walking the railroad tracks at sunset, sharing strawberry sodas at the corner drugstore while the cicadas screamed through the humid evening air. When we weren’t together, I felt his absence like an ache in my ribs, a restlessness in my hands.

The night he kissed me was just after a summer storm. The air was thick with the smell of rain and honeysuckle, the pavement still warm beneath our bare feet as we ran, laughing, through the empty streets. He caught me by the hand just outside my house, his fingers sliding against mine, calloused and warm.

I remember the way he hesitated, the flicker of nerves behind those steady eyes, the way his gaze flicked to my lips before he finally—finally—closed the distance between us.

It was gentle. Reverent. Like he’d been waiting his whole life to do it. I could’ve stayed in that moment forever.

We got married two years later, just before he shipped out to Vietnam.

I wore a white dress my mother had made by hand, simple but beautiful, cinched at the waist with little pearl buttons running down the back. He wore his uniform, the navy-blue wool pressed to perfection, the brass buttons gleaming in the candlelight. He held my hands so tight at the altar that I thought I might break, but I didn’t mind. I never wanted him to let go.

The night before he shipped out, we lay tangled together in the quiet of our bedroom, the moonlight slipping through the lace curtains, painting silver ribbons across the sheets.

Arvin kissed me slowly, reverently, like he was memorizing the shape of me. Like he was trying to leave something behind, a piece of himself buried beneath my skin so that no matter how far he went, no matter how many miles stretched between us, we would still belong to each other.

He brushed his lips over my temple, down the slope of my jaw, his breath warm against my collarbone as he whispered, “Let’s try.”

I knew what he meant.

We had talked about children before, about a house full of them, about tiny feet padding across hardwood floors and the sound of laughter ringing through the halls. He had grown up surrounded by siblings, the kind of childhood that was always full, always loud. I had grown up lonely, an only child in a house too big for just three people, where the silence pressed in at the seams.

I wanted a baby more than anything.

So I whispered, “Yes,” and pulled him closer.

When he left, I wrote to him every day. I told him about the town, about Mrs. Avery’s new flower shop on Main Street, about the way the sunflowers in the front yard had started leaning toward the porch, as if waiting for him to come home. I told him I missed him, that I dreamed about him, that I traced his name against my pillow in the dark.

I had always imagined that waiting for Arvin would be hard, but not like this. Not in the kind of way that made my bones feel hollow, like the wind could whistle through them. Not in the way that made the air in my lungs feel thick and sluggish, like I was drowning in something invisible.

The doctor’s office smelled sterile, like antiseptic and paper, and the chair beneath me felt cold, unyielding, as though it had been designed to brace people for bad news.

“I’m sorry, Mrs. Russell,” the doctor had said, and I could tell, just from the way he said it, just from the quiet way he folded his hands on his desk, that this wasn’t something fixable. That it wasn’t one of those things where you took a pill or changed your diet or waited a few months to try again.

Something inside me cracked, then. A hairline fracture, small and quiet, but real.

I had nodded, numb, feeling like I was moving through a fog. I had thanked him, because that’s what people did when they got bad news. They said thank you and shook hands and left the room, even when they wanted to scream.

I wanted to tell Arvin, needed to tell him.

But when I went to write to him that night, when I sat at the kitchen table with the lamp glowing soft and golden, the radio murmuring low in the background, the words wouldn’t come.

I stared at the blank page, heart pounding, thinking about how to tell him that I couldn’t give him the family that we’d always dreamed of, that I’d failed before we had even really begun.

In the end, I didn’t have to.

The next morning, the news broke. Supply planes shot down, mail no longer being sent overseas.

The realization hit me in pieces—that the last letter I had from him was the last letter I would have for a long, long time. That whatever I wrote now wouldn’t reach him. That he would go on thinking everything was fine, that I was still waiting for him, whole and untouched by anything but time.

The days blurred after that.

I stopped going to church, stopped praying.

Stopped saying grace before meals, stopped carrying my Bible in my purse, stopped listening to the old sermons Arvin had recorded for me on tape.

I couldn’t bring herself to open the pages of scripture, to hear words of comfort that felt hollow in my chest, because what kind of God did this? What kind of God gave a woman a heart so full of love and nowhere to put it?

I started walking, retracing every step I had ever taken with Arvin, wandering through the places that used to feel like home but now felt like false echoes.

I walked through the park where we had spent long summer evenings, my sandals scuffing against the pavement where his boots had once been.

I sat on the hood of our old car at the drive-in, staring at the blank screen, remembering the warmth of his arm slung around my shoulders.

I pressed my palm flat against the wooden pew where they used to sit together in church, tracing the grooves in the grain with my fingertips, knowing I wouldn’t stay for the service.

I walked the whole town that way, walking, retracing, searching for something I couldn’t name.

Searching for him.

But all I ever found was myself, alone, standing in the spaces where he used to be.

I found myself back at the railroad, where Arvin had taken me for our sunsets. It stretched out before me, rust-colored and glinting in the late afternoon light. The sun was beginning its slow descent, bleeding gold and crimson across the sky, casting long shadows that curled and stretched like lazy fingers. Arvin and I used to come here in the evenings, just to sit, just to watch. He used to say there was something holy about the way the light kissed the horizon, something that made the world feel less small, less cruel.

I stepped onto the ties, balancing my weight like I used to when I was a girl, arms stretched out at my sides. The wood was warm beneath my feet, the scent of sun-baked iron filling my lungs.

And then—

Then I wasn’t alone.

The shift was so subtle, I almost didn’t notice it. The air seemed thicker, the wind humming a different tune, just a fraction off-key. And then there was the table.

A small wooden table, impossibly placed, sitting right by the tracks like it had always been there. And at that table sat a man.

He was dressed in a brown tweed suit, the kind my father used to wear to Sunday service, though this one looked like it had never seen a speck of dust. A matching hat sat perched atop his head, shadowing his face just enough that I couldn’t quite make out the details.

But he was smiling.

“Evening, Miss Russell,” he said, tipping his hat. “Mighty fine night for a walk.”

I stopped in my tracks. My pulse skittered in my throat, instinct screaming that he had not been there a moment ago. But the way he spoke, so easy, so familiar—

“I—” My voice came out thick, unused. “Do I know you?”

The man laughed, warm and rich, like the sound of whiskey being poured into a glass. “Oh, I’ve been called many names. Some kind, some cruel. But let’s not worry about all that. Sit with me a while.”

There was something about him. Something that set my nerves alight and soothed them in the same breath. I should’ve turned around. Should’ve walked away.

Instead, I sat.

The chair creaked under my weight, the wood cool against my palms. Up close, he smelled like something sweet and smoky, something old.

He watched me for a long moment before folding his hands on the table. “You’ve been walking this whole town, haven’t you?”

I blinked.

“Yes,” I admitted. “I—” My throat clenched. “I don’t know where to go anymore.”

His expression softened, though the shadow of his hat kept his eyes hidden. “Loss is a cruel thing,” he murmured. “Leaves you hollow, aching. Makes the world feel like it’s moving on without you.”

I swallowed hard, staring down at my hands. “Yes.”

And I told him.

I told him about Arvin, about the letters that wouldn’t reach him, about the way the house felt empty, lifeless. I told him about the doctor, about the words that had shattered me, about the nights I spent awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering what I had done to deserve this.

And he listened.

Not like the women at church who smiled too tight and told me to pray harder. Not like the doctor who gave me facts and figures and sent me on my way.

He listened like someone who had seen grief before, who had worn it like a second skin.

When I finally stopped, breath shaky and fingers gripping the edge of the table, he exhaled slow and deliberate.

“Well now,” he said, voice smooth as honey. “Ain’t that just a tragedy.”

I let out a bitter, broken laugh. “You could say that.”

The man reached into his coat pocket, pulling out a silver case, flicking it open to reveal a single cigar. He turned it between his fingers, thoughtful.

“I do hate to see a woman in pain,” he murmured. “Especially one so faithful.”

I flinched.

“I used to be.” The words tumbled out before I could stop them. “I used to be faithful.”

“Ah,” he sighed, tilting his head. “And yet the good Lord let you suffer. How very like Him.”

I stiffened. “That’s not—”

“It’s alright,” he said gently. “I understand. Faith is a fragile thing.”

He leaned forward slightly, the weight of his presence pressing against me. “But it doesn’t have to be this way.”

A cold prickle danced down my spine. “What do you mean?”

The man rolled the cigar between his fingers again, his smile widening just slightly.

“I mean,” he said, “what if I told you that I could give you what you want?”

The breath left my lungs.

“You—you don’t know what I want.”

“Oh, Charlotte.” My name curled off his tongue like smoke, thick and cloying. “I know exactly what you want.”

My throat tightened.

“You want to be a mother.”

The world tilted.

The wind stilled.

I stared at him, unable to speak, unable to move.

He leaned back, easy and casual, like we were just two old friends discussing the weather. “It’s a simple thing, really. A small thing. And I’d like to give it to you.”

My heart pounded. “Why?”

His smile didn’t waver. “Because I deal in desires. And you, my dear, are a woman who has lost her way.”

Something deep in my chest screamed at me to run, to leave, to scrub the memory of this moment from my mind.

But I didn’t, because he was right.

I had lost my way and I was so, so tired of walking alone.

My fingers curled into fists. “And what—” My voice wavered. “What do you want in return?”

The man exhaled, as if considering. Then, with deliberate slowness, he slid the cigar case across the table toward me.

“Your firstborn.”

The words hit like a blow to the gut, stealing the air from my lungs.

I stared at him, heart thundering, pulse roaring in my ears.

He just smiled.

“That’s all.”

I shook my head, trying to form words, trying to process. “That’s—”

“Now, now,” he said, voice like velvet. “I ain’t askin’ for much. Just a promise. A guarantee.”

I swallowed, my mouth dry as ash. “And if I say no?”

The man shrugged. “Then you say no.”

I exhaled sharply, shoulders shaking.

He waited patiently, knowing.

The sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the tracks.

I thought of Arvin, thought of his hands, calloused and steady. Thought of the way he used to rest them over my stomach, hopeful, expectant.

I thought of the empty house, the empty crib.

The empty years stretching ahead of me.

And I pressed my shaking fingers to the cigar case.

“Alright,” I whispered.

The man grinned.

And then—he was gone.

Like he had never been there at all.




When Arvin came home, he was not the man I had kissed goodbye.

I had braced myself for change, for a shadow in his eyes, for the weight of war hanging from his shoulders like a yoke too heavy to bear. I had seen it before—boys who had gone off laughing, full of reckless youth, only to return silent and hollow, their bodies intact but their souls buried somewhere in the jungles and rice paddies.

But that was not my Arvin.

My Arvin came back with fire in his belly and God in his veins.

He held me tighter than he ever had before, breathing me in like a man drowning, pressing his lips to my forehead, my hands, my stomach. He clutched his Bible like it was the only thing tethering him to this world, thumbing the pages like a man who had read it cover to cover a hundred times and still found something new waiting for him in the margins.

And he told me stories.

Not of death, not of men broken in the mud, not of friends lost to bullets and bayonets—no, not those stories.

He told me of things that lurked beyond the veil of flesh and bone.

“The jungles weren’t just filled with men, Charlotte,” he whispered to me one night, his voice thick with something I couldn’t name. “There were things in there, things that didn’t bleed the way we do.”

I shivered beneath his touch.

“The locals called them jinns,” he murmured, running his fingers along my arm. “Spirits older than man, older than the ground we walked on. We heard them sometimes, whispering in languages none of us knew. And at night, we saw their eyes. Not animal eyes. Not human ones either.”

His grip tightened around my wrist, just for a second.

“Sometimes they looked like men,” he said. “Sometimes they wore the faces of people we knew. But you could always tell. Always.”

I stared at him, heart pounding, the room suddenly too warm, too small.

“What do you mean?” I whispered.

He exhaled slowly.

“They never blinked.”

I swallowed hard.

“One night,” he continued, voice lower now, like he was afraid something might overhear, “we lost a boy. Campbell. Good kid. Grew up in Oklahoma, always talked about a girl waiting for him back home. One day, he just—” Arvin snapped his fingers. “Vanished. No gunfire. No tracks. Just gone.”

A chill ran down my spine.

“We looked for him for three days,” he said. “Nothing. Then, on the fourth day, he walked back into camp. Clothes torn, barefoot, eyes glassy like he wasn’t all there. He told us he’d just gotten lost, that he’d been wandering the whole time, that he was starving.”

Arvin’s jaw tightened.

“But there was something wrong,” he said. “He never blinked. Not once.”

My breath hitched.

“And then, Johnson—our corpsman—took one look at him and said, ‘That ain’t Campbell.’”

I clutched the sheets, my knuckles white.

Arvin looked at me then, eyes dark, unreadable. “And he was right.”

A heavy silence filled the space between us, thick as oil.

I licked my lips nervously, even in the safety of our home. “What did you do?”

He didn’t answer right away.

Finally, he reached for the cross around his neck, fingers running over the worn silver.

“We sent him back into the jungle,” he murmured. “And we didn’t let him come back out.”

A tremor ran through me.

He looked at me then, really looked at me, and in that moment, I saw it—the weight of something old and unshakable, something that had settled into his bones like a second soul.

“War doesn’t just show you the worst in men, Charlotte,” he said softly. “It shows you the worst in everything.”

I had no words.

So I pressed my hand to his chest, feeling the steady rhythm of his heart, grounding myself in the solid warmth of him, in the scent of sweat and faded gunpowder and the soap he had always used.

“I missed you,” I whispered.

He exhaled sharply, his forehead resting against mine.

“I missed you too, darlin’.”

I held him tight, my nails digging into his back, eyes squeezed shut.

And I did not tell him.

I did not tell him that while he was out there, staring into the eyes of something that wasn’t Campbell, I had been here, shaking hands with the devil himself.

I did not tell him about the man in the tweed suit, about the deal I had made, about the thing growing inside me that was both a blessing and a curse.

I did not tell him that I had stopped walking with God.

Because if Arvin had seen what he had seen and still believed, still clutched his Bible like a lifeline—then what did that make me?

And so, I swallowed my guilt.

I kissed him and I prayed.

Not to God, not anymore.

But that my husband would never find out what I had done.

ALAN RUSSELL

The Ozarks were calling.

Not in the way that the woods behind town had always called to us as kids, their winding paths leading to hidden forts and treehouses and long summer days that stretched into the dusk. No, this was something else entirely. This was an escape, a chance to get away from the goddamn town and everything in it—even if just for a few days.

Heather, Mac, and I weren’t the kind of people who usually went on trips like this, the kind with too many people, too much drinking, and the constant push and pull of teenage hormones trying to sort themselves out in the dark. But Trevor Holloway had made a point of inviting us, flashing that too-white, too-perfect smile, promising a real retreat, a chance to breathe, to clear our heads.

So we packed our things.

We left.

We drove.

And for the first time in weeks, I thought that maybe, just maybe, we could outrun all of it.

The sky was still ink-dark when we left Ashwood, the kind of dark that felt heavy, settled, stretching endlessly over the road as if the sun had forgotten it was supposed to rise. The headlights carved through it, twin beams cutting the black into something tangible, the road unfolding before us in yellow lines and patches of cracked asphalt.

Mac had insisted on bringing his family’s old mutt, Biscuit, a shaggy, too-big beast that had been around longer than half the kids in our senior class. He was curled up in the back seat now, nose pressed against the cracked window, watching the trees blur past.

Heather was quiet in the passenger seat, knees tucked up, her head resting against the window. Mac was stretched out in the back, Biscuit curled up beside him, the dog’s shaggy head resting against his lap.

The road stretched long and winding through the hills, the thick green pines towering on either side, stretching toward the sky, the early evening light cutting through in long, golden beams. We were the second car in a three-car caravan, Trevor’s brand new silver Mustang leading the way, my truck in the middle, and a rusted-out old van , packed full of loud teenagers who didn’t seem to care that it was barely five in the morning bringing up the rear.

Heather sat beside me, one foot propped up on the dash, window down, the wind pulling at the ends of her hair.

“You think you packed enough?” she asked, a sly grin spreading across her face.

I glanced at the back seat.

It was full. Overpacked, really.

Boxes of ammunition for my dad’s pistol. Canned food. Sleeping bags. A shortwave radio I had spent the better part of a summer fixing up in the garage.

I hadn’t taken any chances.

“Never hurts to be prepared,” I muttered.

Mac snorted from the passenger seat, feet kicked up, arms folded behind his head.

“You’re a fucking prepper, dude.”

Heather grinned. “What do you think’s gonna happen? You think we’re gonna get lost and have to live off canned beans for a year?”

I didn’t answer. I adjusted my grip on the wheel, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror. The shoebox sat on the seat behind me, wedged between bags and supplies, nothing more than an old piece of cardboard holding the weight of the world.


The drive up into the mountains took about half an hour, the road twisting and narrowing as the world woke around us. By the time we reached the cabin, the sun had finally clawed its way over the horizon, spilling slow, golden light over the endless sea of pines.

And the cabin itself—wasn’t really a cabin at all. It was a goddamn mansion.

Log walls stretched two stories high, with a wraparound porch, thick wooden beams, and a massive stone chimney that looked like it belonged in one of those magazines rich people left on their coffee tables. A wide gravel driveway stretched before it, just big enough for all three cars to pull in and park side by side.

Trevor climbed out of his Mustang, stretching his arms above his head, grinning like he had personally built the place with his own two hands.

“Welcome to my grandpa’s little slice of heaven,” he announced, flashing that toothpaste-commercial grin.

I put the truck in park and stepped out, stretching, breathing in the clean, crisp mountain air.

Heather barely looked at him, already climbing out of my truck, grabbing her bag from the truck bed. Trevor’s eyes followed her, like a hunting dog eying its favorite toy.

I ground my teeth.

The van behind us pulled in next, doors flying open, voices spilling out into the open air—a mix of our classmates, their girlfriends, their boyfriends, a tangle of long legs and denim jackets and the unmistakable scent of cheap beer and cologne.

I recognized a few of them. There was Tricia Langley, the minister’s daughter, who had been far too cozy with Heather’s boyfriend at the last football game.
Eddie Bransford, a nice enough guy, but mostly kept to himself. I’d see him every so often holed up in the chess club room. Brandon Collins, one of our high-school’s best linemen, but continuously preceded by a thick odor that smelled like he hadn’t bathed since middle school. Jenny Parsons, our senior class valedictorian and a future politician in the making. Her hair was perpetually tied up in a ponytail, which was fitting, as I’d always thought she resembled the backside of a horse. Laura Greenfield was rich like Trevor, but a nice enough girl, if a bit airheaded. She had a habit of staring off blankly into space and saying odd things. Mac had a theory that she lost her sense of smell, because she and Brandon had been dating for four years.

There were a few others I didn’t recognize… and then there was us.

Me, Heather and Mac.

We weren’t part of their world, but for this weekend, we were.

And we would play the part.

Music played from someone’s cassette deck, faint and scratchy, the low hum of Fleetwood Mac mixing with the rustling of the wind through the leaves. Biscuit jumped out of the truck, shaking himself off and trotting toward the firepit, nose to the ground. Mac followed, stretching his arms behind his back. Heather stood beside me, watching as Trevor’s crew unloaded cases of beer from the back of the van.

Trevor didn’t leave Heather alone, not really. 
He was always there, at the edge of her space, standing too close, brushing his hand against her back as she walked, touching her arm when he laughed. If I noticed, she had to notice too.

But she didn’t say anything, didn’t push him away, didn’t tell him to back off. Because she was used to it, that it was easier to ignore it than to deal with the fallout of making a scene.

And I hated that.

Trevor was careful about it, too.

He never crossed a clear line, never did anything that couldn’t be excused as just being friendly, just being playful, just being Trevor.

But I could see it in the way Heather’s jaw tightened when he touched her. The way she kept putting space between them, only for him to find his way back in. The way she never looked at me, like she didn’t want me to see.

Trevor gave us a grand tour, walking us through the massive open living room, the kitchen that looked like it had never actually been used, the wraparound deck that overlooked the forest.

“Place has been in the family forever,” he said, pushing open one of the heavy wooden doors. “Grandpa used to bring clients up here for hunting trips, back when people still cared about that kinda thing.”

He grinned over his shoulder.

“Still got a few old rifles locked up in the basement, if anyone wants to make things interesting.”

I didn’t say anything, I didn't need to.

Heather was the one who cut him off, shoving her bag higher on her shoulder.

“Where are the bedrooms?”

Trevor smirked, arching his eyebrows as if he had been waiting for her to ask.

“Whoa, easy there, Heather. I’ve got to show our guests around first.”

Heather didn’t make any effort to conceal just how done she was with his bullshit. Trevor realized he was pushing his luck.

“Ladies get the upstairs,” he said quickly, turning toward the staircase. “Guys are down the hall.”

He turned toward me.

“Well. Most of them.”

I didn’t take the bait, just grabbed my bag and walked past him, heading straight for my room.

It was too big, that was the first thing I noticed.

Too big, too clean, too untouched, like something out of a pottery barn catalog, like no one had ever actually lived in it. The bed was massive, covered in thick blankets that looked like they had never been slept in, and the wooden floor was too polished, too smooth, reflecting the early morning light in a way that felt unnatural.

I dropped my bag onto the mattress, rolling my shoulders, feeling the exhaustion settle in.

Then—I turned to the window.

And felt something in my chest tighten.

The forest stretched out below, dark and endless, the trees swaying just slightly in the morning wind. From here, I could see the path we had driven in on, the winding dirt road cutting through the trees.

And in the distance—a figure shifted, not much, not enough to be sure.

Something too far away to make sense of, something watching.

I stepped closer to the glass, but by the time I reached it—the trees were still.

And the figure was gone.



The first thing I did after tossing my bag onto the bed was start securing the cabin.

Not physically—spiritually.

Mac had called me a prepper before, and maybe he was right. But it wasn’t paranoia. It was survival. You didn’t go through what we had and come out the other side without taking precautions.

I started with the holy water.

I moved through the cabin slow, careful, quiet—no need to let the others know what I was doing. I dipped my fingers into the first jug, letting the cold water settle against my skin, then flicked it across the windows, the doors, the baseboards of every room.

It felt ridiculous.

It should have felt ridiculous.

But it didn’t, not when I had watched Heather’s body levitate off the ground in my own goddamn living room. Not when I had felt something older than language pressing against the walls, clawing to get in. Not when I had seen the Phoenician Club burn a man to death beneath that towering stone owl.

Nothing felt ridiculous anymore.

Upstairs, I paused outside the girls’ rooms, listening for voices. Laughter spilled from inside, soft and light, the kind that only happened on trips like this, when you pretended the real world didn’t exist, when you let yourself believe that everything was fine.

I swallowed.

Then, carefully, I leaned down and poured a thin line of holy water along the threshold.

It dried fast, invisible. But it was there.

Heather didn’t need to know, didn’t need to roll her eyes or tell me I was wasting my time. Because if something came for her again, if it followed her here, it wasn’t getting past that door.

Not this time.


The basement smelled of dust and gun oil. 

It was colder than the rest of the cabin, the stone walls pressing in, lined with old wooden crates and metal shelving, an entire corner stacked with gear that looked like it hadn’t been touched in years.

I ran my hand over a crate, wiping away a layer of fine dust, fingers trailing over the heavy lid. The box wasn’t nailed shut, just weighted down.

I pushed it open and froze.

Inside—guns, not just hunting rifles. Not just a few old family heirlooms locked away for sentimental reasons. An arsenal. 

I crouched, scanning the weapons, my brain automatically sorting, categorizing, taking inventory.

Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle. .30-06 Springfield rounds, old but well-kept.

Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver. Nickel-plated, probably worth more than anything else in the room.

Remington 870 pump-action shotgun. 12-gauge shells stacked beside it.

M1 Carbine. WWII issue. Semi-automatic. Compact.

Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). A goddamn BAR—fully automatic, chambered in .30-06.

Crates of ammunition, stacked and labeled in faded black lettering. .30-06, 12-gauge, .357 Magnum, .45 ACP.


I exhaled slowly, rolling my shoulders back.

This wasn’t a hunting stash.

This was a goddamn armory. As I looked around the room, it slowly began to dawn on me, creeping in the back of my skull and filling my mind with a single, inescapable thought.

Trevor’s grandpa had really good taste in guns.


Unable to help myself, I reached for the BAR, weighing it in my hands. It was a beast of a gun, about sixteen and a half pounds unloaded. The wood furniture on it was smooth, yet well-worn. I checked to make sure the safety was still on and the chamber was clear.

Whoever had stocked this basement had known exactly what they were doing.

I made a mental note of what was here, matching it against what I had brought myself.

My Tokarev TT-33. 7.62x25mm rounds. Didn’t have as much stopping power as the Colt Python, but familiar. Reliable.

A few boxes of ammunition. Enough to last, but not enough for a war.

Canned food, purified water, sealed jugs of holy water. The essentials.

The shoebox. The evidence. The truth.

I decided to stash the  Browning Automatic Rifle, along with several boxes of .30-06 in the nearby locker, twisting the key and pocketing it. Then I headed back upstairs, joining the rest of my friends.



HEATHER ROBINSON

The sun was starting to set, dipping low over the trees, turning the sky into a patchwork of burning orange and deep indigo. The last traces of daylight stretched long and thin across the porch, spilling through the cabin’s wide-open windows, painting the wooden floors in shifting streaks of gold.

Inside, the others were already deep into their routine debauchery.

Tricia and Rachel had taken over the kitchen, laughing as they poured vodka into Solo cups, cheap liquor sloshing over the counters, soaking into the wood.

Someone had dragged the speakers from Trevor’s Mustang inside, and now music pulsed low and steady, the kind of beat that filled the walls, vibrated through the floors, settled somewhere beneath your skin.

Trevor was in his element, leaning against the counter, beer in hand, laughing too easily, flashing that too-perfect grin at any girl who happened to look his way.

It was a scene I had seen before, too many times.

Brandon Collins, was sinking into the worn leather recliner, a bottle of Jack cradled in his lap. Across from him, Laura Greenfield sat curled up on the rug, head tilted back, staring at the ceiling like she was trying to read the patterns in the wooden beams.

But my eyes were locked on Tricia Langley, the minister’s daughter who kissed like she was trying to prove something, perched on the arm of the couch, laughing at something too loudly, tilting her head just enough to make sure her hair caught the light.


I walked outside for a moment, leaning against the railing, watching the treeline, listening, alone with my thoughts.

For a while, nothing. Then—peals of laughter.

Not from inside the cabin or from the trees. From the side of the house, where the porch wrapped around toward the back, hidden from view.

I knew that laugh.

Low, rough, familiar.

I followed the sound, stepping quietly, keeping to the shadows, because I already knew what I was going to find. 

It wasn’t subtle. It never was. And sure enough—there they were. Trevor and Tricia.

Pressed up against the wooden siding, her hands in his hair, his fingers digging into her waist, leaning in close, his hand pressed flat beside her head, smirking down at her the way he used to smirk down at me.

She was smiling, her fingers toyingly trailing up his chest, her eyes half-lidded in a way that left nothing to the imagination.

They weren’t kissing, not yet.

I watched them for half a second, just long enough to feel that tiny, distant flicker of not surprise.

I didn’t feel betrayal, heartbreak, or anything resembling sadness, just a deep, gnawing exhaustion. This wasn’t the first time.

It was just the last.



Trevor didn’t see me at first. Neither did Tricia. But when I stopped just a few feet away, arms crossed, eyes steady—Trevor turned. The grin didn’t fall from his face. If anything, it widened.

“Hey, babe,” he drawled, like I hadn't just watched him pin the minister’s daughter against the wall.

Tricia smirked. I ignored her.

“You really can’t help yourself, can you?” My voice was calm, almost detached.

Trevor shrugged, taking a slow sip from his beer. “What are you talking about?”

I let out a breath, shaking my head.

“I’m done.”

He blinked for a moment, the meaning of my words taking a moment to penetrate his thick skull. Then—he laughed. A real, full-bodied laugh, like this was the funniest thing he had ever heard.

“You’re breaking up with me?”

He took a step forward, smelling like beer and expensive cologne, that cocky smirk still glued to his face.

“Come on, babe, don’t be like that,” he murmured, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear.

I caught his wrist before he could touch me.

“I said I’m done.”

His fingers twitched beneath mine. For a second, I thought he might say something else, might try to convince me, manipulate me, try to pull me back in like he always did.

But then he saw it the way I was looking at him, not with anger or pain. And I think, for the first time, gazing into the pools of pure apathy in my eyes, Trevor Holloway realized he had lost.

I let go of his wrist, then I walked away and didn’t look back. I walked back toward the front of the house, where  Mac was standing by the door, beer in hand, watching me.
I exhaled, rolling my shoulders, shaking off the tension like it was just another thing to deal with.

“Didn’t last long this time,” Mac muttered.

I smirked. “Not even a full week.”

I let a full grin spread across my face, reveling in the moment.

“But I made sure it was the last time.”

I pushed past him into the house, grabbing a beer from the counter.

Trevor came in a minute later, his hair a little messier, his collar slightly askew. He didn’t meet my eyes.

The night stretched on, swallowing the last light of day, wrapping the cabin in thick, endless black. The trees swayed lazily in the wind, their rustling just barely audible over the thrum of music and laughter spilling from the open windows.

The air had changed.

Not suddenly. Not all at once. But slowly, gradually, the way the light shifts in the late afternoon when a storm is creeping in, when the sun still shines but the sky turns just a little too dark at the edges, like something vast and heavy is waiting beyond the clouds.

The party was still going. The music was still pulsing, the bottles still clinking, the laughter still ringing through the rooms, but it was different now—something about the sound felt thinner, stretched too tight, like the noise wasn’t bouncing off the walls the way it should, like the cabin had grown larger, swallowing it whole.

Even inside, I could feel the trees pressing in.

And I wasn’t the only one.

“I don’t like it,” Eddie muttered, his voice barely carrying over the music. He had stationed himself near the fireplace, still nursing the same beer he had opened an hour ago, his book tucked under his arm like a security blanket.

Brandon Collins, red-faced and swaying slightly from one too many Jack-and-Cokes, huffed and waved him off. “You don’t like anything, man.”

Eddie frowned, his eyes flicking toward the window. “No, seriously. Something’s… off.”

Jenny Parsons was perched on the couch, one leg crossed over the other, her sharp, ever-watchful gaze following the conversation. She tapped her fingers against the armrest, considering.

“I heard it too,” she admitted.

Tricia, still glowing with the satisfaction of having gotten what she wanted from Trevor, rolled her eyes. “Oh, please. You guys are like a bunch of kids getting scared over ghost stories. It’s probably just a squirrel. Or—” She smirked. “Maybe it’s Bigfoot.”

Laura, still curled up on the rug at Brandon’s feet, twirled a strand of hair around her fingers, her expression eerily blank. “It doesn’t feel like raccoons,” she murmured.

The room got a little quieter.

“Uh… honey? What the hell does that mean?” Brandon asked, shifting uncomfortably.

Laura didn’t answer. She just kept staring into the grain of the wooden ceiling.




It was hard to tell when the sound started.

Maybe it had been there all along—too soft at first, too distant, too easily dismissed.

But now, it was undeniable. A rhythmic rustling in the trees, not frantic, not wild, not the careless movement of an animal searching for food—but slow. Deliberate.

Like footsteps.

Brandon turned his head toward the window, brow furrowing. “Okay, that? That wasn’t a fucking squirrel.”

A few of the others laughed, but it wasn’t real. It was forced, tight, the kind of laugh that came when someone was trying too hard to shake off a feeling they didn’t want to have.

Eddie stood, moving to the window. He pressed a palm against the glass, peering out into the darkness.

“I don’t see anything,” he muttered.

The wind pushed against the cabin, the sound of the trees bending and groaning filling the silence left in the wake of his words.

Then—a snap.

Loud. Clear. A branch breaking under the weight of something. Someone.

The music kept playing, but nobody was listening anymore.

Jenny stood, smoothing down her sweater. “Alright, I think this has gone on long enough. Trevor, you have, what, a rifle somewhere in this place? Why don’t you go outside and scare off whatever it is before Eddie has a heart attack?”

Trevor smirked, but it was weaker this time.

“Oh, sure. Let me just go out and get mauled by a bear for your amusement.”

Mac, who had been unusually quiet, leaned against the counter, sipping his beer. “You think it’s a bear?”

Trevor scoffed. “What else would it be?”

Mac shrugged.

“Well, I’m sure I don’t know, Trevor.”

The wind picked up again, whistling through the trees, carrying with it the deep, dense scent of damp earth and pine.

And beneath it—something else, bitter and rotten.

Brandon gagged. “Jesus, what is that?”

Jenny covered her nose. “God, it smells like something crawled under the porch and died.”

Eddie was still at the window.

Still watching.

And I saw it in his posture, in the way his hand tensed against the glass, in the way his breath caught just slightly in his throat.

He saw something.

“Eddie?” I prompted.

His fingers curled into a fist.

“I think there’s someone out there.”



The music cut out first, dropping the room into an abrupt, suffocating silence.

The lights flickered, once, twice, and then the cabin went dark.

Someone yelped.

Brandon cursed. “Oh, fuck this. Where’s the goddamn generator?”

Nobody moved.

I was close enough to see Mac, barely a shadow in the dark, his hand slowly reaching toward his belt.

And from outside—from the deep, yawning blackness of the trees—came the sound of something dragging across the porch.

A slow, scraping sound, like nails against wood.

Or claws.


The silence in the cabin was thick and absolute, like the darkness outside had slithered its way in through the cracks, filling the empty spaces between us, curling around our throats, pressing its weight into our chests.

For a long moment, nobody spoke.

Nobody moved.

The only sound was the slow, agonizing scrape of something outside, dragging its way across the porch—deliberate, unhurried, like whatever was out there had all the time in the world.

Then—

Brandon swallowed hard. “Somebody should get a gun.”

The words landed heavy in the room.

Trevor scoffed, but the usual arrogance in his voice was thinner now, stretched tight beneath something he didn’t want us to hear. “Jesus, Brandon. It’s probably just some animal.”

“Yeah? And if it’s not?” Jenny cut in, arms folded tight across her chest. “You’ve got a goddamn arsenal down there, don’t you? Maybe now would be a good time to stop pretending you’re not freaked out too.”

Trevor hesitated.

Then—

He smirked. “Fine. But when I come back and it turns out to be a deer or some stoned camper looking for a place to piss, I get to say I told you so.”

Nobody laughed.

Nobody even cracked a smile.

He exhaled sharply, then turned and disappeared down the basement stairs.

The moment he was gone, the room felt emptier.

The wind outside sighed through the trees, rattling the windows, making the wooden beams of the cabin groan under their own weight.

Trevor was taking too long.

Brandon shifted uncomfortably. “Shouldn’t he be back by now?”

Jenny shot him a look. “Maybe don’t say ominous shit like that when we’re all already freaked out.”

Eddie was still at the window, watching. He hadn’t spoken in a while, but I could see it in his posture—something was wrong. The dragging sound on the porch had stopped.

That should’ve made me feel better, but it didn’t.

The basement door swung open, louder than it needed to, making a few people jump.

Trevor strode back into the room, a Winchester rifle slung over his shoulder, Colt Python dangling from his fingers, smirking like this was all some elaborate joke and he was just waiting for the punchline.

“Happy now?” he drawled, dropping both weapons onto the counter with a solid thud.

Brandon let out a slow breath. “Much.”

The shift was almost immediate.

The weight in the room eased, just a little. The silence didn’t feel so oppressive anymore. Mac stepped forward first, reaching for the rifle, running a hand over the wood, checking the chamber.

“Loaded?”

Trevor scoffed. “Of course it’s loaded.”

Mac smirked, but there wasn’t much humor in it. “For once, you’re actually useful.”

Trevor rolled his eyes, already reaching for another drink. Somewhere in the depths of the cabin, a faint hum started. A second later, the lights flickered once, twice—then flared back to life. A collective breath rushed out of the room.

Brandon let out a short, breathy laugh, shaking his head. “Well, that was fucking creepy.”

Jenny sighed, smoothing down her sweater. “Alright. Crisis averted. Somebody turn the damn music back on.”

The tension in the room cracked, not all at once, but in slow, cautious fractures—first in the way Brandon reached for his drink again, then in the way Tricia threw herself back onto the couch with a theatrical sigh, then in the way Mac, still gripping the rifle, leaned against the counter and smirked at me.

“You look disappointed,” he murmured.

I raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?”

“Yeah.” He tilted his head. “What, were you hoping it was Bigfoot?”

I huffed out a laugh. “Just hoping it was something we could shoot.”

Trevor’s laugh was too loud, too forced. “Christ, you people are paranoid.”

I ignored him.

Eddie lingered by the window, eyes still flicking between the trees, fingers still tense against the glass.

But the music started up again, and the bottles clinked, and soon the air was buzzing once more with easy laughter and the warmth of cheap liquor and the glow of artificial light.


ALAN RUSSELL



The night had settled into something slow and hazy, its edges softened by alcohol and flickering candlelight, the low hum of conversation and music pulsing beneath the wooden beams of the cabin.

Downstairs, the party was still going, but the worst of it had passed—the reckless, feverish energy had given way to something lazier, sleepier, more indulgent, the kind of drunk that had people curling into corners, voices hushed, movements slow. The tension from earlier had faded into something quieter, something that could almost be mistaken for comfort.

But it wasn’t gone.

It had just buried itself beneath the noise.

I wasn’t drinking.

Not because I had any moral objection to it, but because I wanted to keep my head clear. Something still felt off, something I couldn’t quite name, and I wasn’t about to let myself sink into the same haze as the rest of them.

I envied them.

Not because they were having fun, but because they could pretend. Because they could drink themselves into a haze and let themselves believe, even for a night, that the world outside this cabin wasn’t rotting, that the things lurking in the dark weren’t real, that nothing was waiting for them beyond the tree line.

I couldn’t do that.

So I had excused myself, leaving behind the glow of the fire and the warmth of the party, making my way to my bathroom—attached to the massive room that was my bedroom, far enough away from the main floor that I could almost pretend I was alone up here, separate from the noise, the alcohol, the heavy scent of cigarette smoke wafting through the halls.

I dipped my hand into the warm holy water that filled the clawfoot tub, watching as steam curled lazily into the air, spreading through the dimly lit room like a breath. The scent of minerals hung in the air, clean and sharp.

Holy water.

I had boiled it first, let it settle, then cooled it down just enough to be tolerable.

A stupid idea, probably. 

But if it worked—if it did anything at all—then maybe I had finally found a way to fight back. Maybe I had found something that could keep the things in the dark away for good.

If I could climb into that water and come out whole, untouched, untouchable—then maybe I had found something real, something I could fight back with.

I took a deep breath, leaning against the sink.

There was a soft knock on the door.

I turned my head, eyes searching for the mysterious late-night visitor.

Heather was standing in the doorway, one hand resting against the frame, her hair slightly tousled, her cheeks flushed just a little too pink. She wasn’t drunk, not really, but she was loose, the sharp edges of her usual guarded expression softened, smoothed over by just enough alcohol to make her brave.

I straightened. “You okay?”

She didn’t speak right away, just nodded and stepped inside, closing the door behind her.

Suddenly the noise from the party felt very far away.

Heather sighed, leaning back against the counter, toying with the hem of her sweater. She stood in the doorway, one hand resting on the frame, her hair slightly windblown from the open windows downstairs.

I watched her for a moment. “You sure everything’s okay?”

She smirked. “You mean, besides my now very public breakup and the fact that Tricia is probably jumping my ex as we speak?”

I shrugged. “I wasn’t gonna say it.”

Her smirk faded into something quieter, something thoughtful.

“I never really loved him.”

The words were quiet, flat. Like she had just realized it herself. 

I searched her face.

“I know.”

She huffed out a small laugh, shaking her head. “Of course you do.”

A silence stretched between us. Not awkward. Not uncomfortable. Just there.

“I needed some air,” she murmured. “Too many people downstairs. Too many…” She trailed off, then smirked. “Too many Trevors.”

I huffed out a quiet laugh. “Yeah. I figured that breakup wouldn’t exactly ruin his night.”

Heather rolled her eyes, tilting her head back. “It’s honestly embarrassing how little I care. It’s like I was dating a houseplant.”

“A very persistent houseplant.”

She laughed, really laughed, and the sound settled warm and low in my chest, curling around something I had been trying to ignore for a long time.

She looked at me then, eyes flicking down to the tub, to the steam rising off the water. “You were about to take a bath?”

I rubbed the back of my neck sheepishly. “Seemed like a better use of my time than getting trashed with the rest of them.”

She smiled, small and knowing.

“I used to picture this, you know.”

I blinked. “What?”

She hesitated, like she hadn’t meant to say it, like the words had slipped out before she could stop them.

Then she sighed, shaking her head, laughing a little at herself.

“Us,” she admitted. “Being alone like this. Away from everything. Away from… everyone.” She glanced down at her hands. “I thought, if things had gone differently, maybe we would’ve—”

She cut herself off, didn’t finish the sentence.

I glanced up at her, mentally testing the waters.

“Me too.”

I reached up, brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. The words hung between us, heavy and real. And just like that—we were somewhere else. Not in this cabin, not in this moment, but in every moment before it.

All the nights we had spent talking in hushed voices, knees touching beneath library tables, hands brushing in the dark. Every time I had looked at her and thought, just once. Just for a second.

I had never let myself have it, had never let myself want it.

Until now.

She took a step towards me, slow, measured, like she was giving me time to stop her. 

I didn’t.

She stepped closer, just enough to close the space between us, just enough to feel the warmth radiating off her skin, just enough to see the way her breath hitched slightly, the way her lips parted like she was about to say something but forgot what it was.

Her fingers brushed mine, a whisper of warmth, a question without words. 

Then she grabbed my collar, pulled me down, and kissed me.

It wasn’t slow or hesitant. It was deep and real and aching, the kind of kiss that wasn’t a mistake, wasn’t an accident, wasn’t something that could be undone.

I melted into it, into her. Into the feeling of her hands gripping the front of my shirt, pulling me closer, pressing into me like she had been waiting just as long as I had. She tasted like warmth, like whiskey and something sweet, like the taste of waking from a refreshing slumber.

My hands slid to her waist, anchoring her, pulling her against me. And for the first time in years, I wasn’t thinking, wasn’t second-guessing.

I was just here with her.

Heather pulled back, just slightly, her breath warm against my lips, her fingers still curled into my shirt.

But her eyes—her eyes had flicked to the steaming tub behind me.

And when she looked back at me, there was something new in those pools of green, something I had never seen before. Something that sent a slow, spreading heat curling through my stomach, wrapping around my ribs, creeping up my spine.

I swallowed, my throat suddenly dry.

She smiled ferociously.

ALAN RUSSELL

The Ozarks were calling.

Not in the way that the woods behind town had always called to us as kids, their winding paths leading to hidden forts and treehouses and long summer days that stretched into the dusk. No, this was something else entirely. This was an escape, a chance to get away from the goddamn town and everything in it—even if just for a few days.

Heather, Mac, and I weren’t the kind of people who usually went on trips like this, the kind with too many people, too much drinking, and the constant push and pull of teenage hormones trying to sort themselves out in the dark. But Trevor Holloway had made a point of inviting us, flashing that too-white, too-perfect smile, promising a real retreat, a chance to breathe, to clear our heads.

So we packed our things.

We left.

We drove.

And for the first time in weeks, I thought that maybe, just maybe, we could outrun all of it.

The sky was still ink-dark when we left Ashwood, the kind of dark that felt heavy, settled, stretching endlessly over the road as if the sun had forgotten it was supposed to rise. The headlights carved through it, twin beams cutting the black into something tangible, the road unfolding before us in yellow lines and patches of cracked asphalt.

Mac had insisted on bringing his family’s old mutt, Biscuit, a shaggy, too-big beast that had been around longer than half the kids in our senior class. He was curled up in the back seat now, nose pressed against the cracked window, watching the trees blur past.

Heather was quiet in the passenger seat, knees tucked up, her head resting against the window. Mac was stretched out in the back, Biscuit curled up beside him, the dog’s shaggy head resting against his lap.

The road stretched long and winding through the hills, the thick green pines towering on either side, stretching toward the sky, the early evening light cutting through in long, golden beams. We were the second car in a three-car caravan, Trevor’s brand new silver Mustang leading the way, my truck in the middle, and a rusted-out old van , packed full of loud teenagers who didn’t seem to care that it was barely five in the morning bringing up the rear.

Heather sat beside me, one foot propped up on the dash, window down, the wind pulling at the ends of her hair.

“You think you packed enough?” she asked, a sly grin spreading across her face.

I glanced at the back seat.

It was full. Overpacked, really.

Boxes of ammunition for my dad’s pistol. Canned food. Sleeping bags. A shortwave radio I had spent the better part of a summer fixing up in the garage.

I hadn’t taken any chances.

“Never hurts to be prepared,” I muttered.

Mac snorted from the passenger seat, feet kicked up, arms folded behind his head.

“You’re a fucking prepper, dude.”

Heather grinned. “What do you think’s gonna happen? You think we’re gonna get lost and have to live off canned beans for a year?”

I didn’t answer. I adjusted my grip on the wheel, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror. The shoebox sat on the seat behind me, wedged between bags and supplies, nothing more than an old piece of cardboard holding the weight of the world.


The drive up into the mountains took about half an hour, the road twisting and narrowing as the world woke around us. By the time we reached the cabin, the sun had finally clawed its way over the horizon, spilling slow, golden light over the endless sea of pines.

And the cabin itself—wasn’t really a cabin at all. It was a goddamn mansion.

Log walls stretched two stories high, with a wraparound porch, thick wooden beams, and a massive stone chimney that looked like it belonged in one of those magazines rich people left on their coffee tables. A wide gravel driveway stretched before it, just big enough for all three cars to pull in and park side by side.

Trevor climbed out of his Mustang, stretching his arms above his head, grinning like he had personally built the place with his own two hands.

“Welcome to my grandpa’s little slice of heaven,” he announced, flashing that toothpaste-commercial grin.

I put the truck in park and stepped out, stretching, breathing in the clean, crisp mountain air.

Heather barely looked at him, already climbing out of my truck, grabbing her bag from the truck bed. Trevor’s eyes followed her, like a hunting dog eying its favorite toy.

I ground my teeth.

The van behind us pulled in next, doors flying open, voices spilling out into the open air—a mix of our classmates, their girlfriends, their boyfriends, a tangle of long legs and denim jackets and the unmistakable scent of cheap beer and cologne.

I recognized a few of them. There was Tricia Langley, the minister’s daughter, who had been far too cozy with Heather’s boyfriend at the last football game.
Eddie Bransford, a nice enough guy, but mostly kept to himself. I’d see him every so often holed up in the chess club room. Brandon Collins, one of our high-school’s best linemen, but continuously preceded by a thick odor that smelled like he hadn’t bathed since middle school. Jenny Parsons, our senior class valedictorian and a future politician in the making. Her hair was perpetually tied up in a ponytail, which was fitting, as I’d always thought she resembled the backside of a horse. Laura Greenfield was rich like Trevor, but a nice enough girl, if a bit airheaded. She had a habit of staring off blankly into space and saying odd things. Mac had a theory that she lost her sense of smell, because she and Brandon had been dating for four years.

There were a few others I didn’t recognize… and then there was us.

Me, Heather and Mac.

We weren’t part of their world, but for this weekend, we were.

And we would play the part.

Music played from someone’s cassette deck, faint and scratchy, the low hum of Fleetwood Mac mixing with the rustling of the wind through the leaves. Biscuit jumped out of the truck, shaking himself off and trotting toward the firepit, nose to the ground. Mac followed, stretching his arms behind his back. Heather stood beside me, watching as Trevor’s crew unloaded cases of beer from the back of the van.

Trevor didn’t leave Heather alone, not really. 
He was always there, at the edge of her space, standing too close, brushing his hand against her back as she walked, touching her arm when he laughed. If I noticed, she had to notice too.

But she didn’t say anything, didn’t push him away, didn’t tell him to back off. Because she was used to it, that it was easier to ignore it than to deal with the fallout of making a scene.

And I hated that.

Trevor was careful about it, too.

He never crossed a clear line, never did anything that couldn’t be excused as just being friendly, just being playful, just being Trevor.

But I could see it in the way Heather’s jaw tightened when he touched her. The way she kept putting space between them, only for him to find his way back in. The way she never looked at me, like she didn’t want me to see.

Trevor gave us a grand tour, walking us through the massive open living room, the kitchen that looked like it had never actually been used, the wraparound deck that overlooked the forest.

“Place has been in the family forever,” he said, pushing open one of the heavy wooden doors. “Grandpa used to bring clients up here for hunting trips, back when people still cared about that kinda thing.”

He grinned over his shoulder.

“Still got a few old rifles locked up in the basement, if anyone wants to make things interesting.”

I didn’t say anything, I didn't need to.

Heather was the one who cut him off, shoving her bag higher on her shoulder.

“Where are the bedrooms?”

Trevor smirked, arching his eyebrows as if he had been waiting for her to ask.

“Whoa, easy there, Heather. I’ve got to show our guests around first.”

Heather didn’t make any effort to conceal just how done she was with his bullshit. Trevor realized he was pushing his luck.

“Ladies get the upstairs,” he said quickly, turning toward the staircase. “Guys are down the hall.”

He turned toward me.

“Well. Most of them.”

I didn’t take the bait, just grabbed my bag and walked past him, heading straight for my room.

It was too big, that was the first thing I noticed.

Too big, too clean, too untouched, like something out of a pottery barn catalog, like no one had ever actually lived in it. The bed was massive, covered in thick blankets that looked like they had never been slept in, and the wooden floor was too polished, too smooth, reflecting the early morning light in a way that felt unnatural.

I dropped my bag onto the mattress, rolling my shoulders, feeling the exhaustion settle in.

Then—I turned to the window.

And felt something in my chest tighten.

The forest stretched out below, dark and endless, the trees swaying just slightly in the morning wind. From here, I could see the path we had driven in on, the winding dirt road cutting through the trees.

And in the distance—a figure shifted, not much, not enough to be sure.

Something too far away to make sense of, something watching.

I stepped closer to the glass, but by the time I reached it—the trees were still.

And the figure was gone.



The first thing I did after tossing my bag onto the bed was start securing the cabin.

Not physically—spiritually.

Mac had called me a prepper before, and maybe he was right. But it wasn’t paranoia. It was survival. You didn’t go through what we had and come out the other side without taking precautions.

I started with the holy water.

I moved through the cabin slow, careful, quiet—no need to let the others know what I was doing. I dipped my fingers into the first jug, letting the cold water settle against my skin, then flicked it across the windows, the doors, the baseboards of every room.

It felt ridiculous.

It should have felt ridiculous.

But it didn’t, not when I had watched Heather’s body levitate off the ground in my own goddamn living room. Not when I had felt something older than language pressing against the walls, clawing to get in. Not when I had seen the Phoenician Club burn a man to death beneath that towering stone owl.

Nothing felt ridiculous anymore.

Upstairs, I paused outside the girls’ rooms, listening for voices. Laughter spilled from inside, soft and light, the kind that only happened on trips like this, when you pretended the real world didn’t exist, when you let yourself believe that everything was fine.

I swallowed.

Then, carefully, I leaned down and poured a thin line of holy water along the threshold.

It dried fast, invisible. But it was there.

Heather didn’t need to know, didn’t need to roll her eyes or tell me I was wasting my time. Because if something came for her again, if it followed her here, it wasn’t getting past that door.

Not this time.


The basement smelled of dust and gun oil. 

It was colder than the rest of the cabin, the stone walls pressing in, lined with old wooden crates and metal shelving, an entire corner stacked with gear that looked like it hadn’t been touched in years.

I ran my hand over a crate, wiping away a layer of fine dust, fingers trailing over the heavy lid. The box wasn’t nailed shut, just weighted down.

I pushed it open and froze.

Inside—guns, not just hunting rifles. Not just a few old family heirlooms locked away for sentimental reasons. An arsenal. 

I crouched, scanning the weapons, my brain automatically sorting, categorizing, taking inventory.

Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle. .30-06 Springfield rounds, old but well-kept.

Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver. Nickel-plated, probably worth more than anything else in the room.

Remington 870 pump-action shotgun. 12-gauge shells stacked beside it.

M1 Carbine. WWII issue. Semi-automatic. Compact.

Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). A goddamn BAR—fully automatic, chambered in .30-06.

Crates of ammunition, stacked and labeled in faded black lettering. .30-06, 12-gauge, .357 Magnum, .45 ACP.


I exhaled slowly, rolling my shoulders back.

This wasn’t a hunting stash.

This was a goddamn armory. As I looked around the room, it slowly began to dawn on me, creeping in the back of my skull and filling my mind with a single, inescapable thought.

Trevor’s grandpa had really good taste in guns.


Unable to help myself, I reached for the BAR, weighing it in my hands. It was a beast of a gun, about sixteen and a half pounds unloaded. The wood furniture on it was smooth, yet well-worn. I checked to make sure the safety was still on and the chamber was clear.

Whoever had stocked this basement had known exactly what they were doing.

I made a mental note of what was here, matching it against what I had brought myself.

My Tokarev TT-33. 7.62x25mm rounds. Didn’t have as much stopping power as the Colt Python, but familiar. Reliable.

A few boxes of ammunition. Enough to last, but not enough for a war.

Canned food, purified water, sealed jugs of holy water. The essentials.

The shoebox. The evidence. The truth.

I decided to stash the  Browning Automatic Rifle, along with several boxes of .30-06 in the nearby locker, twisting the key and pocketing it. Then I headed back upstairs, joining the rest of my friends.



HEATHER ROBINSON

The sun was starting to set, dipping low over the trees, turning the sky into a patchwork of burning orange and deep indigo. The last traces of daylight stretched long and thin across the porch, spilling through the cabin’s wide-open windows, painting the wooden floors in shifting streaks of gold.

Inside, the others were already deep into their routine debauchery.

Tricia and Rachel had taken over the kitchen, laughing as they poured vodka into Solo cups, cheap liquor sloshing over the counters, soaking into the wood.

Someone had dragged the speakers from Trevor’s Mustang inside, and now music pulsed low and steady, the kind of beat that filled the walls, vibrated through the floors, settled somewhere beneath your skin.

Trevor was in his element, leaning against the counter, beer in hand, laughing too easily, flashing that too-perfect grin at any girl who happened to look his way.

It was a scene I had seen before, too many times.

Brandon Collins, was sinking into the worn leather recliner, a bottle of Jack cradled in his lap. Across from him, Laura Greenfield sat curled up on the rug, head tilted back, staring at the ceiling like she was trying to read the patterns in the wooden beams.

But my eyes were locked on Tricia Langley, the minister’s daughter who kissed like she was trying to prove something, perched on the arm of the couch, laughing at something too loudly, tilting her head just enough to make sure her hair caught the light.


I walked outside for a moment, leaning against the railing, watching the treeline, listening, alone with my thoughts.

For a while, nothing. Then—peals of laughter.

Not from inside the cabin or from the trees. From the side of the house, where the porch wrapped around toward the back, hidden from view.

I knew that laugh.

Low, rough, familiar.

I followed the sound, stepping quietly, keeping to the shadows, because I already knew what I was going to find. 

It wasn’t subtle. It never was. And sure enough—there they were. Trevor and Tricia.

Pressed up against the wooden siding, her hands in his hair, his fingers digging into her waist, leaning in close, his hand pressed flat beside her head, smirking down at her the way he used to smirk down at me.

She was smiling, her fingers toyingly trailing up his chest, her eyes half-lidded in a way that left nothing to the imagination.

They weren’t kissing, not yet.

I watched them for half a second, just long enough to feel that tiny, distant flicker of not surprise.

I didn’t feel betrayal, heartbreak, or anything resembling sadness, just a deep, gnawing exhaustion. This wasn’t the first time.

It was just the last.



Trevor didn’t see me at first. Neither did Tricia. But when I stopped just a few feet away, arms crossed, eyes steady—Trevor turned. The grin didn’t fall from his face. If anything, it widened.

“Hey, babe,” he drawled, like I hadn't just watched him pin the minister’s daughter against the wall.

Tricia smirked. I ignored her.

“You really can’t help yourself, can you?” My voice was calm, almost detached.

Trevor shrugged, taking a slow sip from his beer. “What are you talking about?”

I let out a breath, shaking my head.

“I’m done.”

He blinked for a moment, the meaning of my words taking a moment to penetrate his thick skull. Then—he laughed. A real, full-bodied laugh, like this was the funniest thing he had ever heard.

“You’re breaking up with me?”

He took a step forward, smelling like beer and expensive cologne, that cocky smirk still glued to his face.

“Come on, babe, don’t be like that,” he murmured, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear.

I caught his wrist before he could touch me.

“I said I’m done.”

His fingers twitched beneath mine. For a second, I thought he might say something else, might try to convince me, manipulate me, try to pull me back in like he always did.

But then he saw it the way I was looking at him, not with anger or pain. And I think, for the first time, gazing into the pools of pure apathy in my eyes, Trevor Holloway realized he had lost.

I let go of his wrist, then I walked away and didn’t look back. I walked back toward the front of the house, where  Mac was standing by the door, beer in hand, watching me.
I exhaled, rolling my shoulders, shaking off the tension like it was just another thing to deal with.

“Didn’t last long this time,” Mac muttered.

I smirked. “Not even a full week.”

I let a full grin spread across my face, reveling in the moment.

“But I made sure it was the last time.”

I pushed past him into the house, grabbing a beer from the counter.

Trevor came in a minute later, his hair a little messier, his collar slightly askew. He didn’t meet my eyes.

The night stretched on, swallowing the last light of day, wrapping the cabin in thick, endless black. The trees swayed lazily in the wind, their rustling just barely audible over the thrum of music and laughter spilling from the open windows.

The air had changed.

Not suddenly. Not all at once. But slowly, gradually, the way the light shifts in the late afternoon when a storm is creeping in, when the sun still shines but the sky turns just a little too dark at the edges, like something vast and heavy is waiting beyond the clouds.

The party was still going. The music was still pulsing, the bottles still clinking, the laughter still ringing through the rooms, but it was different now—something about the sound felt thinner, stretched too tight, like the noise wasn’t bouncing off the walls the way it should, like the cabin had grown larger, swallowing it whole.

Even inside, I could feel the trees pressing in.

And I wasn’t the only one.

“I don’t like it,” Eddie muttered, his voice barely carrying over the music. He had stationed himself near the fireplace, still nursing the same beer he had opened an hour ago, his book tucked under his arm like a security blanket.

Brandon Collins, red-faced and swaying slightly from one too many Jack-and-Cokes, huffed and waved him off. “You don’t like anything, man.”

Eddie frowned, his eyes flicking toward the window. “No, seriously. Something’s… off.”

Jenny Parsons was perched on the couch, one leg crossed over the other, her sharp, ever-watchful gaze following the conversation. She tapped her fingers against the armrest, considering.

“I heard it too,” she admitted.

Tricia, still glowing with the satisfaction of having gotten what she wanted from Trevor, rolled her eyes. “Oh, please. You guys are like a bunch of kids getting scared over ghost stories. It’s probably just a squirrel. Or—” She smirked. “Maybe it’s Bigfoot.”

Laura, still curled up on the rug at Brandon’s feet, twirled a strand of hair around her fingers, her expression eerily blank. “It doesn’t feel like raccoons,” she murmured.

The room got a little quieter.

“Uh… honey? What the hell does that mean?” Brandon asked, shifting uncomfortably.

Laura didn’t answer. She just kept staring into the grain of the wooden ceiling.




It was hard to tell when the sound started.

Maybe it had been there all along—too soft at first, too distant, too easily dismissed.

But now, it was undeniable. A rhythmic rustling in the trees, not frantic, not wild, not the careless movement of an animal searching for food—but slow. Deliberate.

Like footsteps.

Brandon turned his head toward the window, brow furrowing. “Okay, that? That wasn’t a fucking squirrel.”

A few of the others laughed, but it wasn’t real. It was forced, tight, the kind of laugh that came when someone was trying too hard to shake off a feeling they didn’t want to have.

Eddie stood, moving to the window. He pressed a palm against the glass, peering out into the darkness.

“I don’t see anything,” he muttered.

The wind pushed against the cabin, the sound of the trees bending and groaning filling the silence left in the wake of his words.

Then—a snap.

Loud. Clear. A branch breaking under the weight of something. Someone.

The music kept playing, but nobody was listening anymore.

Jenny stood, smoothing down her sweater. “Alright, I think this has gone on long enough. Trevor, you have, what, a rifle somewhere in this place? Why don’t you go outside and scare off whatever it is before Eddie has a heart attack?”

Trevor smirked, but it was weaker this time.

“Oh, sure. Let me just go out and get mauled by a bear for your amusement.”

Mac, who had been unusually quiet, leaned against the counter, sipping his beer. “You think it’s a bear?”

Trevor scoffed. “What else would it be?”

Mac shrugged.

“Well, I’m sure I don’t know, Trevor.”

The wind picked up again, whistling through the trees, carrying with it the deep, dense scent of damp earth and pine.

And beneath it—something else, bitter and rotten.

Brandon gagged. “Jesus, what is that?”

Jenny covered her nose. “God, it smells like something crawled under the porch and died.”

Eddie was still at the window.

Still watching.

And I saw it in his posture, in the way his hand tensed against the glass, in the way his breath caught just slightly in his throat.

He saw something.

“Eddie?” I prompted.

His fingers curled into a fist.

“I think there’s someone out there.”



The music cut out first, dropping the room into an abrupt, suffocating silence.

The lights flickered, once, twice, and then the cabin went dark.

Someone yelped.

Brandon cursed. “Oh, fuck this. Where’s the goddamn generator?”

Nobody moved.

I was close enough to see Mac, barely a shadow in the dark, his hand slowly reaching toward his belt.

And from outside—from the deep, yawning blackness of the trees—came the sound of something dragging across the porch.

A slow, scraping sound, like nails against wood.

Or claws.


The silence in the cabin was thick and absolute, like the darkness outside had slithered its way in through the cracks, filling the empty spaces between us, curling around our throats, pressing its weight into our chests.

For a long moment, nobody spoke.

Nobody moved.

The only sound was the slow, agonizing scrape of something outside, dragging its way across the porch—deliberate, unhurried, like whatever was out there had all the time in the world.

Then—

Brandon swallowed hard. “Somebody should get a gun.”

The words landed heavy in the room.

Trevor scoffed, but the usual arrogance in his voice was thinner now, stretched tight beneath something he didn’t want us to hear. “Jesus, Brandon. It’s probably just some animal.”

“Yeah? And if it’s not?” Jenny cut in, arms folded tight across her chest. “You’ve got a goddamn arsenal down there, don’t you? Maybe now would be a good time to stop pretending you’re not freaked out too.”

Trevor hesitated.

Then—

He smirked. “Fine. But when I come back and it turns out to be a deer or some stoned camper looking for a place to piss, I get to say I told you so.”

Nobody laughed.

Nobody even cracked a smile.

He exhaled sharply, then turned and disappeared down the basement stairs.

The moment he was gone, the room felt emptier.

The wind outside sighed through the trees, rattling the windows, making the wooden beams of the cabin groan under their own weight.

Trevor was taking too long.

Brandon shifted uncomfortably. “Shouldn’t he be back by now?”

Jenny shot him a look. “Maybe don’t say ominous shit like that when we’re all already freaked out.”

Eddie was still at the window, watching. He hadn’t spoken in a while, but I could see it in his posture—something was wrong. The dragging sound on the porch had stopped.

That should’ve made me feel better, but it didn’t.

The basement door swung open, louder than it needed to, making a few people jump.

Trevor strode back into the room, a Winchester rifle slung over his shoulder, Colt Python dangling from his fingers, smirking like this was all some elaborate joke and he was just waiting for the punchline.

“Happy now?” he drawled, dropping both weapons onto the counter with a solid thud.

Brandon let out a slow breath. “Much.”

The shift was almost immediate.

The weight in the room eased, just a little. The silence didn’t feel so oppressive anymore. Mac stepped forward first, reaching for the rifle, running a hand over the wood, checking the chamber.

“Loaded?”

Trevor scoffed. “Of course it’s loaded.”

Mac smirked, but there wasn’t much humor in it. “For once, you’re actually useful.”

Trevor rolled his eyes, already reaching for another drink. Somewhere in the depths of the cabin, a faint hum started. A second later, the lights flickered once, twice—then flared back to life. A collective breath rushed out of the room.

Brandon let out a short, breathy laugh, shaking his head. “Well, that was fucking creepy.”

Jenny sighed, smoothing down her sweater. “Alright. Crisis averted. Somebody turn the damn music back on.”

The tension in the room cracked, not all at once, but in slow, cautious fractures—first in the way Brandon reached for his drink again, then in the way Tricia threw herself back onto the couch with a theatrical sigh, then in the way Mac, still gripping the rifle, leaned against the counter and smirked at me.

“You look disappointed,” he murmured.

I raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?”

“Yeah.” He tilted his head. “What, were you hoping it was Bigfoot?”

I huffed out a laugh. “Just hoping it was something we could shoot.”

Trevor’s laugh was too loud, too forced. “Christ, you people are paranoid.”

I ignored him.

Eddie lingered by the window, eyes still flicking between the trees, fingers still tense against the glass.

But the music started up again, and the bottles clinked, and soon the air was buzzing once more with easy laughter and the warmth of cheap liquor and the glow of artificial light.


ALAN RUSSELL



The night had settled into something slow and hazy, its edges softened by alcohol and flickering candlelight, the low hum of conversation and music pulsing beneath the wooden beams of the cabin.

Downstairs, the party was still going, but the worst of it had passed—the reckless, feverish energy had given way to something lazier, sleepier, more indulgent, the kind of drunk that had people curling into corners, voices hushed, movements slow. The tension from earlier had faded into something quieter, something that could almost be mistaken for comfort.

But it wasn’t gone.

It had just buried itself beneath the noise.

I wasn’t drinking.

Not because I had any moral objection to it, but because I wanted to keep my head clear. Something still felt off, something I couldn’t quite name, and I wasn’t about to let myself sink into the same haze as the rest of them.

I envied them.

Not because they were having fun, but because they could pretend. Because they could drink themselves into a haze and let themselves believe, even for a night, that the world outside this cabin wasn’t rotting, that the things lurking in the dark weren’t real, that nothing was waiting for them beyond the tree line.

I couldn’t do that.

So I had excused myself, leaving behind the glow of the fire and the warmth of the party, making my way to my bathroom—attached to the massive room that was my bedroom, far enough away from the main floor that I could almost pretend I was alone up here, separate from the noise, the alcohol, the heavy scent of cigarette smoke wafting through the halls.

I dipped my hand into the warm holy water that filled the clawfoot tub, watching as steam curled lazily into the air, spreading through the dimly lit room like a breath. The scent of minerals hung in the air, clean and sharp.

Holy water.

I had boiled it first, let it settle, then cooled it down just enough to be tolerable.

A stupid idea, probably. 

But if it worked—if it did anything at all—then maybe I had finally found a way to fight back. Maybe I had found something that could keep the things in the dark away for good.

If I could climb into that water and come out whole, untouched, untouchable—then maybe I had found something real, something I could fight back with.

I took a deep breath, leaning against the sink.

There was a soft knock on the door.

I turned my head, eyes searching for the mysterious late-night visitor.

Heather was standing in the doorway, one hand resting against the frame, her hair slightly tousled, her cheeks flushed just a little too pink. She wasn’t drunk, not really, but she was loose, the sharp edges of her usual guarded expression softened, smoothed over by just enough alcohol to make her brave.

I straightened. “You okay?”

She didn’t speak right away, just nodded and stepped inside, closing the door behind her.

Suddenly the noise from the party felt very far away.

Heather sighed, leaning back against the counter, toying with the hem of her sweater. She stood in the doorway, one hand resting on the frame, her hair slightly windblown from the open windows downstairs.

I watched her for a moment. “You sure everything’s okay?”

She smirked. “You mean, besides my now very public breakup and the fact that Tricia is probably jumping my ex as we speak?”

I shrugged. “I wasn’t gonna say it.”

Her smirk faded into something quieter, something thoughtful.

“I never really loved him.”

The words were quiet, flat. Like she had just realized it herself. 

I searched her face.

“I know.”

She huffed out a small laugh, shaking her head. “Of course you do.”

A silence stretched between us. Not awkward. Not uncomfortable. Just there.

“I needed some air,” she murmured. “Too many people downstairs. Too many…” She trailed off, then smirked. “Too many Trevors.”

I huffed out a quiet laugh. “Yeah. I figured that breakup wouldn’t exactly ruin his night.”

Heather rolled her eyes, tilting her head back. “It’s honestly embarrassing how little I care. It’s like I was dating a houseplant.”

“A very persistent houseplant.”

She laughed, really laughed, and the sound settled warm and low in my chest, curling around something I had been trying to ignore for a long time.

She looked at me then, eyes flicking down to the tub, to the steam rising off the water. “You were about to take a bath?”

I rubbed the back of my neck sheepishly. “Seemed like a better use of my time than getting trashed with the rest of them.”

She smiled, small and knowing.

“I used to picture this, you know.”

I blinked. “What?”

She hesitated, like she hadn’t meant to say it, like the words had slipped out before she could stop them.

Then she sighed, shaking her head, laughing a little at herself.

“Us,” she admitted. “Being alone like this. Away from everything. Away from… everyone.” She glanced down at her hands. “I thought, if things had gone differently, maybe we would’ve—”

She cut herself off, didn’t finish the sentence.

I glanced up at her, mentally testing the waters.

“Me too.”

I reached up, brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. The words hung between us, heavy and real. And just like that—we were somewhere else. Not in this cabin, not in this moment, but in every moment before it.

All the nights we had spent talking in hushed voices, knees touching beneath library tables, hands brushing in the dark. Every time I had looked at her and thought, just once. Just for a second.

I had never let myself have it, had never let myself want it.

Until now.

She took a step towards me, slow, measured, like she was giving me time to stop her. 

I didn’t.

She stepped closer, just enough to close the space between us, just enough to feel the warmth radiating off her skin, just enough to see the way her breath hitched slightly, the way her lips parted like she was about to say something but forgot what it was.

Her fingers brushed mine, a whisper of warmth, a question without words. 

Then she grabbed my collar, pulled me down, and kissed me.

It wasn’t slow or hesitant. It was deep and real and aching, the kind of kiss that wasn’t a mistake, wasn’t an accident, wasn’t something that could be undone.

I melted into it, into her. Into the feeling of her hands gripping the front of my shirt, pulling me closer, pressing into me like she had been waiting just as long as I had. She tasted like warmth, like whiskey and something sweet, like the taste of waking from a refreshing slumber.

My hands slid to her waist, anchoring her, pulling her against me. And for the first time in years, I wasn’t thinking, wasn’t second-guessing.

I was just here with her.

Heather pulled back, just slightly, her breath warm against my lips, her fingers still curled into my shirt.

But her eyes—her eyes had flicked to the steaming tub behind me.

And when she looked back at me, there was something new in those pools of green, something I had never seen before. Something that sent a slow, spreading heat curling through my stomach, wrapping around my ribs, creeping up my spine.

I swallowed, my throat suddenly dry.

She smiled ferociously.

ALAN RUSSELL

The Ozarks were calling.

Not in the way that the woods behind town had always called to us as kids, their winding paths leading to hidden forts and treehouses and long summer days that stretched into the dusk. No, this was something else entirely. This was an escape, a chance to get away from the goddamn town and everything in it—even if just for a few days.

Heather, Mac, and I weren’t the kind of people who usually went on trips like this, the kind with too many people, too much drinking, and the constant push and pull of teenage hormones trying to sort themselves out in the dark. But Trevor Holloway had made a point of inviting us, flashing that too-white, too-perfect smile, promising a real retreat, a chance to breathe, to clear our heads.

So we packed our things.

We left.

We drove.

And for the first time in weeks, I thought that maybe, just maybe, we could outrun all of it.

The sky was still ink-dark when we left Ashwood, the kind of dark that felt heavy, settled, stretching endlessly over the road as if the sun had forgotten it was supposed to rise. The headlights carved through it, twin beams cutting the black into something tangible, the road unfolding before us in yellow lines and patches of cracked asphalt.

Mac had insisted on bringing his family’s old mutt, Biscuit, a shaggy, too-big beast that had been around longer than half the kids in our senior class. He was curled up in the back seat now, nose pressed against the cracked window, watching the trees blur past.

Heather was quiet in the passenger seat, knees tucked up, her head resting against the window. Mac was stretched out in the back, Biscuit curled up beside him, the dog’s shaggy head resting against his lap.

The road stretched long and winding through the hills, the thick green pines towering on either side, stretching toward the sky, the early evening light cutting through in long, golden beams. We were the second car in a three-car caravan, Trevor’s brand new silver Mustang leading the way, my truck in the middle, and a rusted-out old van , packed full of loud teenagers who didn’t seem to care that it was barely five in the morning bringing up the rear.

Heather sat beside me, one foot propped up on the dash, window down, the wind pulling at the ends of her hair.

“You think you packed enough?” she asked, a sly grin spreading across her face.

I glanced at the back seat.

It was full. Overpacked, really.

Boxes of ammunition for my dad’s pistol. Canned food. Sleeping bags. A shortwave radio I had spent the better part of a summer fixing up in the garage.

I hadn’t taken any chances.

“Never hurts to be prepared,” I muttered.

Mac snorted from the passenger seat, feet kicked up, arms folded behind his head.

“You’re a fucking prepper, dude.”

Heather grinned. “What do you think’s gonna happen? You think we’re gonna get lost and have to live off canned beans for a year?”

I didn’t answer. I adjusted my grip on the wheel, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror. The shoebox sat on the seat behind me, wedged between bags and supplies, nothing more than an old piece of cardboard holding the weight of the world.


The drive up into the mountains took about half an hour, the road twisting and narrowing as the world woke around us. By the time we reached the cabin, the sun had finally clawed its way over the horizon, spilling slow, golden light over the endless sea of pines.

And the cabin itself—wasn’t really a cabin at all. It was a goddamn mansion.

Log walls stretched two stories high, with a wraparound porch, thick wooden beams, and a massive stone chimney that looked like it belonged in one of those magazines rich people left on their coffee tables. A wide gravel driveway stretched before it, just big enough for all three cars to pull in and park side by side.

Trevor climbed out of his Mustang, stretching his arms above his head, grinning like he had personally built the place with his own two hands.

“Welcome to my grandpa’s little slice of heaven,” he announced, flashing that toothpaste-commercial grin.

I put the truck in park and stepped out, stretching, breathing in the clean, crisp mountain air.

Heather barely looked at him, already climbing out of my truck, grabbing her bag from the truck bed. Trevor’s eyes followed her, like a hunting dog eying its favorite toy.

I ground my teeth.

The van behind us pulled in next, doors flying open, voices spilling out into the open air—a mix of our classmates, their girlfriends, their boyfriends, a tangle of long legs and denim jackets and the unmistakable scent of cheap beer and cologne.

I recognized a few of them. There was Tricia Langley, the minister’s daughter, who had been far too cozy with Heather’s boyfriend at the last football game.
Eddie Bransford, a nice enough guy, but mostly kept to himself. I’d see him every so often holed up in the chess club room. Brandon Collins, one of our high-school’s best linemen, but continuously preceded by a thick odor that smelled like he hadn’t bathed since middle school. Jenny Parsons, our senior class valedictorian and a future politician in the making. Her hair was perpetually tied up in a ponytail, which was fitting, as I’d always thought she resembled the backside of a horse. Laura Greenfield was rich like Trevor, but a nice enough girl, if a bit airheaded. She had a habit of staring off blankly into space and saying odd things. Mac had a theory that she lost her sense of smell, because she and Brandon had been dating for four years.

There were a few others I didn’t recognize… and then there was us.

Me, Heather and Mac.

We weren’t part of their world, but for this weekend, we were.

And we would play the part.

Music played from someone’s cassette deck, faint and scratchy, the low hum of Fleetwood Mac mixing with the rustling of the wind through the leaves. Biscuit jumped out of the truck, shaking himself off and trotting toward the firepit, nose to the ground. Mac followed, stretching his arms behind his back. Heather stood beside me, watching as Trevor’s crew unloaded cases of beer from the back of the van.

Trevor didn’t leave Heather alone, not really. 
He was always there, at the edge of her space, standing too close, brushing his hand against her back as she walked, touching her arm when he laughed. If I noticed, she had to notice too.

But she didn’t say anything, didn’t push him away, didn’t tell him to back off. Because she was used to it, that it was easier to ignore it than to deal with the fallout of making a scene.

And I hated that.

Trevor was careful about it, too.

He never crossed a clear line, never did anything that couldn’t be excused as just being friendly, just being playful, just being Trevor.

But I could see it in the way Heather’s jaw tightened when he touched her. The way she kept putting space between them, only for him to find his way back in. The way she never looked at me, like she didn’t want me to see.

Trevor gave us a grand tour, walking us through the massive open living room, the kitchen that looked like it had never actually been used, the wraparound deck that overlooked the forest.

“Place has been in the family forever,” he said, pushing open one of the heavy wooden doors. “Grandpa used to bring clients up here for hunting trips, back when people still cared about that kinda thing.”

He grinned over his shoulder.

“Still got a few old rifles locked up in the basement, if anyone wants to make things interesting.”

I didn’t say anything, I didn't need to.

Heather was the one who cut him off, shoving her bag higher on her shoulder.

“Where are the bedrooms?”

Trevor smirked, arching his eyebrows as if he had been waiting for her to ask.

“Whoa, easy there, Heather. I’ve got to show our guests around first.”

Heather didn’t make any effort to conceal just how done she was with his bullshit. Trevor realized he was pushing his luck.

“Ladies get the upstairs,” he said quickly, turning toward the staircase. “Guys are down the hall.”

He turned toward me.

“Well. Most of them.”

I didn’t take the bait, just grabbed my bag and walked past him, heading straight for my room.

It was too big, that was the first thing I noticed.

Too big, too clean, too untouched, like something out of a pottery barn catalog, like no one had ever actually lived in it. The bed was massive, covered in thick blankets that looked like they had never been slept in, and the wooden floor was too polished, too smooth, reflecting the early morning light in a way that felt unnatural.

I dropped my bag onto the mattress, rolling my shoulders, feeling the exhaustion settle in.

Then—I turned to the window.

And felt something in my chest tighten.

The forest stretched out below, dark and endless, the trees swaying just slightly in the morning wind. From here, I could see the path we had driven in on, the winding dirt road cutting through the trees.

And in the distance—a figure shifted, not much, not enough to be sure.

Something too far away to make sense of, something watching.

I stepped closer to the glass, but by the time I reached it—the trees were still.

And the figure was gone.



The first thing I did after tossing my bag onto the bed was start securing the cabin.

Not physically—spiritually.

Mac had called me a prepper before, and maybe he was right. But it wasn’t paranoia. It was survival. You didn’t go through what we had and come out the other side without taking precautions.

I started with the holy water.

I moved through the cabin slow, careful, quiet—no need to let the others know what I was doing. I dipped my fingers into the first jug, letting the cold water settle against my skin, then flicked it across the windows, the doors, the baseboards of every room.

It felt ridiculous.

It should have felt ridiculous.

But it didn’t, not when I had watched Heather’s body levitate off the ground in my own goddamn living room. Not when I had felt something older than language pressing against the walls, clawing to get in. Not when I had seen the Phoenician Club burn a man to death beneath that towering stone owl.

Nothing felt ridiculous anymore.

Upstairs, I paused outside the girls’ rooms, listening for voices. Laughter spilled from inside, soft and light, the kind that only happened on trips like this, when you pretended the real world didn’t exist, when you let yourself believe that everything was fine.

I swallowed.

Then, carefully, I leaned down and poured a thin line of holy water along the threshold.

It dried fast, invisible. But it was there.

Heather didn’t need to know, didn’t need to roll her eyes or tell me I was wasting my time. Because if something came for her again, if it followed her here, it wasn’t getting past that door.

Not this time.


The basement smelled of dust and gun oil. 

It was colder than the rest of the cabin, the stone walls pressing in, lined with old wooden crates and metal shelving, an entire corner stacked with gear that looked like it hadn’t been touched in years.

I ran my hand over a crate, wiping away a layer of fine dust, fingers trailing over the heavy lid. The box wasn’t nailed shut, just weighted down.

I pushed it open and froze.

Inside—guns, not just hunting rifles. Not just a few old family heirlooms locked away for sentimental reasons. An arsenal. 

I crouched, scanning the weapons, my brain automatically sorting, categorizing, taking inventory.

Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle. .30-06 Springfield rounds, old but well-kept.

Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver. Nickel-plated, probably worth more than anything else in the room.

Remington 870 pump-action shotgun. 12-gauge shells stacked beside it.

M1 Carbine. WWII issue. Semi-automatic. Compact.

Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). A goddamn BAR—fully automatic, chambered in .30-06.

Crates of ammunition, stacked and labeled in faded black lettering. .30-06, 12-gauge, .357 Magnum, .45 ACP.


I exhaled slowly, rolling my shoulders back.

This wasn’t a hunting stash.

This was a goddamn armory. As I looked around the room, it slowly began to dawn on me, creeping in the back of my skull and filling my mind with a single, inescapable thought.

Trevor’s grandpa had really good taste in guns.


Unable to help myself, I reached for the BAR, weighing it in my hands. It was a beast of a gun, about sixteen and a half pounds unloaded. The wood furniture on it was smooth, yet well-worn. I checked to make sure the safety was still on and the chamber was clear.

Whoever had stocked this basement had known exactly what they were doing.

I made a mental note of what was here, matching it against what I had brought myself.

My Tokarev TT-33. 7.62x25mm rounds. Didn’t have as much stopping power as the Colt Python, but familiar. Reliable.

A few boxes of ammunition. Enough to last, but not enough for a war.

Canned food, purified water, sealed jugs of holy water. The essentials.

The shoebox. The evidence. The truth.

I decided to stash the  Browning Automatic Rifle, along with several boxes of .30-06 in the nearby locker, twisting the key and pocketing it. Then I headed back upstairs, joining the rest of my friends.



HEATHER ROBINSON

The sun was starting to set, dipping low over the trees, turning the sky into a patchwork of burning orange and deep indigo. The last traces of daylight stretched long and thin across the porch, spilling through the cabin’s wide-open windows, painting the wooden floors in shifting streaks of gold.

Inside, the others were already deep into their routine debauchery.

Tricia and Rachel had taken over the kitchen, laughing as they poured vodka into Solo cups, cheap liquor sloshing over the counters, soaking into the wood.

Someone had dragged the speakers from Trevor’s Mustang inside, and now music pulsed low and steady, the kind of beat that filled the walls, vibrated through the floors, settled somewhere beneath your skin.

Trevor was in his element, leaning against the counter, beer in hand, laughing too easily, flashing that too-perfect grin at any girl who happened to look his way.

It was a scene I had seen before, too many times.

Brandon Collins, was sinking into the worn leather recliner, a bottle of Jack cradled in his lap. Across from him, Laura Greenfield sat curled up on the rug, head tilted back, staring at the ceiling like she was trying to read the patterns in the wooden beams.

But my eyes were locked on Tricia Langley, the minister’s daughter who kissed like she was trying to prove something, perched on the arm of the couch, laughing at something too loudly, tilting her head just enough to make sure her hair caught the light.


I walked outside for a moment, leaning against the railing, watching the treeline, listening, alone with my thoughts.

For a while, nothing. Then—peals of laughter.

Not from inside the cabin or from the trees. From the side of the house, where the porch wrapped around toward the back, hidden from view.

I knew that laugh.

Low, rough, familiar.

I followed the sound, stepping quietly, keeping to the shadows, because I already knew what I was going to find. 

It wasn’t subtle. It never was. And sure enough—there they were. Trevor and Tricia.

Pressed up against the wooden siding, her hands in his hair, his fingers digging into her waist, leaning in close, his hand pressed flat beside her head, smirking down at her the way he used to smirk down at me.

She was smiling, her fingers toyingly trailing up his chest, her eyes half-lidded in a way that left nothing to the imagination.

They weren’t kissing, not yet.

I watched them for half a second, just long enough to feel that tiny, distant flicker of not surprise.

I didn’t feel betrayal, heartbreak, or anything resembling sadness, just a deep, gnawing exhaustion. This wasn’t the first time.

It was just the last.



Trevor didn’t see me at first. Neither did Tricia. But when I stopped just a few feet away, arms crossed, eyes steady—Trevor turned. The grin didn’t fall from his face. If anything, it widened.

“Hey, babe,” he drawled, like I hadn't just watched him pin the minister’s daughter against the wall.

Tricia smirked. I ignored her.

“You really can’t help yourself, can you?” My voice was calm, almost detached.

Trevor shrugged, taking a slow sip from his beer. “What are you talking about?”

I let out a breath, shaking my head.

“I’m done.”

He blinked for a moment, the meaning of my words taking a moment to penetrate his thick skull. Then—he laughed. A real, full-bodied laugh, like this was the funniest thing he had ever heard.

“You’re breaking up with me?”

He took a step forward, smelling like beer and expensive cologne, that cocky smirk still glued to his face.

“Come on, babe, don’t be like that,” he murmured, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear.

I caught his wrist before he could touch me.

“I said I’m done.”

His fingers twitched beneath mine. For a second, I thought he might say something else, might try to convince me, manipulate me, try to pull me back in like he always did.

But then he saw it the way I was looking at him, not with anger or pain. And I think, for the first time, gazing into the pools of pure apathy in my eyes, Trevor Holloway realized he had lost.

I let go of his wrist, then I walked away and didn’t look back. I walked back toward the front of the house, where  Mac was standing by the door, beer in hand, watching me.
I exhaled, rolling my shoulders, shaking off the tension like it was just another thing to deal with.

“Didn’t last long this time,” Mac muttered.

I smirked. “Not even a full week.”

I let a full grin spread across my face, reveling in the moment.

“But I made sure it was the last time.”

I pushed past him into the house, grabbing a beer from the counter.

Trevor came in a minute later, his hair a little messier, his collar slightly askew. He didn’t meet my eyes.

The night stretched on, swallowing the last light of day, wrapping the cabin in thick, endless black. The trees swayed lazily in the wind, their rustling just barely audible over the thrum of music and laughter spilling from the open windows.

The air had changed.

Not suddenly. Not all at once. But slowly, gradually, the way the light shifts in the late afternoon when a storm is creeping in, when the sun still shines but the sky turns just a little too dark at the edges, like something vast and heavy is waiting beyond the clouds.

The party was still going. The music was still pulsing, the bottles still clinking, the laughter still ringing through the rooms, but it was different now—something about the sound felt thinner, stretched too tight, like the noise wasn’t bouncing off the walls the way it should, like the cabin had grown larger, swallowing it whole.

Even inside, I could feel the trees pressing in.

And I wasn’t the only one.

“I don’t like it,” Eddie muttered, his voice barely carrying over the music. He had stationed himself near the fireplace, still nursing the same beer he had opened an hour ago, his book tucked under his arm like a security blanket.

Brandon Collins, red-faced and swaying slightly from one too many Jack-and-Cokes, huffed and waved him off. “You don’t like anything, man.”

Eddie frowned, his eyes flicking toward the window. “No, seriously. Something’s… off.”

Jenny Parsons was perched on the couch, one leg crossed over the other, her sharp, ever-watchful gaze following the conversation. She tapped her fingers against the armrest, considering.

“I heard it too,” she admitted.

Tricia, still glowing with the satisfaction of having gotten what she wanted from Trevor, rolled her eyes. “Oh, please. You guys are like a bunch of kids getting scared over ghost stories. It’s probably just a squirrel. Or—” She smirked. “Maybe it’s Bigfoot.”

Laura, still curled up on the rug at Brandon’s feet, twirled a strand of hair around her fingers, her expression eerily blank. “It doesn’t feel like raccoons,” she murmured.

The room got a little quieter.

“Uh… honey? What the hell does that mean?” Brandon asked, shifting uncomfortably.

Laura didn’t answer. She just kept staring into the grain of the wooden ceiling.




It was hard to tell when the sound started.

Maybe it had been there all along—too soft at first, too distant, too easily dismissed.

But now, it was undeniable. A rhythmic rustling in the trees, not frantic, not wild, not the careless movement of an animal searching for food—but slow. Deliberate.

Like footsteps.

Brandon turned his head toward the window, brow furrowing. “Okay, that? That wasn’t a fucking squirrel.”

A few of the others laughed, but it wasn’t real. It was forced, tight, the kind of laugh that came when someone was trying too hard to shake off a feeling they didn’t want to have.

Eddie stood, moving to the window. He pressed a palm against the glass, peering out into the darkness.

“I don’t see anything,” he muttered.

The wind pushed against the cabin, the sound of the trees bending and groaning filling the silence left in the wake of his words.

Then—a snap.

Loud. Clear. A branch breaking under the weight of something. Someone.

The music kept playing, but nobody was listening anymore.

Jenny stood, smoothing down her sweater. “Alright, I think this has gone on long enough. Trevor, you have, what, a rifle somewhere in this place? Why don’t you go outside and scare off whatever it is before Eddie has a heart attack?”

Trevor smirked, but it was weaker this time.

“Oh, sure. Let me just go out and get mauled by a bear for your amusement.”

Mac, who had been unusually quiet, leaned against the counter, sipping his beer. “You think it’s a bear?”

Trevor scoffed. “What else would it be?”

Mac shrugged.

“Well, I’m sure I don’t know, Trevor.”

The wind picked up again, whistling through the trees, carrying with it the deep, dense scent of damp earth and pine.

And beneath it—something else, bitter and rotten.

Brandon gagged. “Jesus, what is that?”

Jenny covered her nose. “God, it smells like something crawled under the porch and died.”

Eddie was still at the window.

Still watching.

And I saw it in his posture, in the way his hand tensed against the glass, in the way his breath caught just slightly in his throat.

He saw something.

“Eddie?” I prompted.

His fingers curled into a fist.

“I think there’s someone out there.”



The music cut out first, dropping the room into an abrupt, suffocating silence.

The lights flickered, once, twice, and then the cabin went dark.

Someone yelped.

Brandon cursed. “Oh, fuck this. Where’s the goddamn generator?”

Nobody moved.

I was close enough to see Mac, barely a shadow in the dark, his hand slowly reaching toward his belt.

And from outside—from the deep, yawning blackness of the trees—came the sound of something dragging across the porch.

A slow, scraping sound, like nails against wood.

Or claws.


The silence in the cabin was thick and absolute, like the darkness outside had slithered its way in through the cracks, filling the empty spaces between us, curling around our throats, pressing its weight into our chests.

For a long moment, nobody spoke.

Nobody moved.

The only sound was the slow, agonizing scrape of something outside, dragging its way across the porch—deliberate, unhurried, like whatever was out there had all the time in the world.

Then—

Brandon swallowed hard. “Somebody should get a gun.”

The words landed heavy in the room.

Trevor scoffed, but the usual arrogance in his voice was thinner now, stretched tight beneath something he didn’t want us to hear. “Jesus, Brandon. It’s probably just some animal.”

“Yeah? And if it’s not?” Jenny cut in, arms folded tight across her chest. “You’ve got a goddamn arsenal down there, don’t you? Maybe now would be a good time to stop pretending you’re not freaked out too.”

Trevor hesitated.

Then—

He smirked. “Fine. But when I come back and it turns out to be a deer or some stoned camper looking for a place to piss, I get to say I told you so.”

Nobody laughed.

Nobody even cracked a smile.

He exhaled sharply, then turned and disappeared down the basement stairs.

The moment he was gone, the room felt emptier.

The wind outside sighed through the trees, rattling the windows, making the wooden beams of the cabin groan under their own weight.

Trevor was taking too long.

Brandon shifted uncomfortably. “Shouldn’t he be back by now?”

Jenny shot him a look. “Maybe don’t say ominous shit like that when we’re all already freaked out.”

Eddie was still at the window, watching. He hadn’t spoken in a while, but I could see it in his posture—something was wrong. The dragging sound on the porch had stopped.

That should’ve made me feel better, but it didn’t.

The basement door swung open, louder than it needed to, making a few people jump.

Trevor strode back into the room, a Winchester rifle slung over his shoulder, Colt Python dangling from his fingers, smirking like this was all some elaborate joke and he was just waiting for the punchline.

“Happy now?” he drawled, dropping both weapons onto the counter with a solid thud.

Brandon let out a slow breath. “Much.”

The shift was almost immediate.

The weight in the room eased, just a little. The silence didn’t feel so oppressive anymore. Mac stepped forward first, reaching for the rifle, running a hand over the wood, checking the chamber.

“Loaded?”

Trevor scoffed. “Of course it’s loaded.”

Mac smirked, but there wasn’t much humor in it. “For once, you’re actually useful.”

Trevor rolled his eyes, already reaching for another drink. Somewhere in the depths of the cabin, a faint hum started. A second later, the lights flickered once, twice—then flared back to life. A collective breath rushed out of the room.

Brandon let out a short, breathy laugh, shaking his head. “Well, that was fucking creepy.”

Jenny sighed, smoothing down her sweater. “Alright. Crisis averted. Somebody turn the damn music back on.”

The tension in the room cracked, not all at once, but in slow, cautious fractures—first in the way Brandon reached for his drink again, then in the way Tricia threw herself back onto the couch with a theatrical sigh, then in the way Mac, still gripping the rifle, leaned against the counter and smirked at me.

“You look disappointed,” he murmured.

I raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?”

“Yeah.” He tilted his head. “What, were you hoping it was Bigfoot?”

I huffed out a laugh. “Just hoping it was something we could shoot.”

Trevor’s laugh was too loud, too forced. “Christ, you people are paranoid.”

I ignored him.

Eddie lingered by the window, eyes still flicking between the trees, fingers still tense against the glass.

But the music started up again, and the bottles clinked, and soon the air was buzzing once more with easy laughter and the warmth of cheap liquor and the glow of artificial light.


ALAN RUSSELL



The night had settled into something slow and hazy, its edges softened by alcohol and flickering candlelight, the low hum of conversation and music pulsing beneath the wooden beams of the cabin.

Downstairs, the party was still going, but the worst of it had passed—the reckless, feverish energy had given way to something lazier, sleepier, more indulgent, the kind of drunk that had people curling into corners, voices hushed, movements slow. The tension from earlier had faded into something quieter, something that could almost be mistaken for comfort.

But it wasn’t gone.

It had just buried itself beneath the noise.

I wasn’t drinking.

Not because I had any moral objection to it, but because I wanted to keep my head clear. Something still felt off, something I couldn’t quite name, and I wasn’t about to let myself sink into the same haze as the rest of them.

I envied them.

Not because they were having fun, but because they could pretend. Because they could drink themselves into a haze and let themselves believe, even for a night, that the world outside this cabin wasn’t rotting, that the things lurking in the dark weren’t real, that nothing was waiting for them beyond the tree line.

I couldn’t do that.

So I had excused myself, leaving behind the glow of the fire and the warmth of the party, making my way to my bathroom—attached to the massive room that was my bedroom, far enough away from the main floor that I could almost pretend I was alone up here, separate from the noise, the alcohol, the heavy scent of cigarette smoke wafting through the halls.

I dipped my hand into the warm holy water that filled the clawfoot tub, watching as steam curled lazily into the air, spreading through the dimly lit room like a breath. The scent of minerals hung in the air, clean and sharp.

Holy water.

I had boiled it first, let it settle, then cooled it down just enough to be tolerable.

A stupid idea, probably. 

But if it worked—if it did anything at all—then maybe I had finally found a way to fight back. Maybe I had found something that could keep the things in the dark away for good.

If I could climb into that water and come out whole, untouched, untouchable—then maybe I had found something real, something I could fight back with.

I took a deep breath, leaning against the sink.

There was a soft knock on the door.

I turned my head, eyes searching for the mysterious late-night visitor.

Heather was standing in the doorway, one hand resting against the frame, her hair slightly tousled, her cheeks flushed just a little too pink. She wasn’t drunk, not really, but she was loose, the sharp edges of her usual guarded expression softened, smoothed over by just enough alcohol to make her brave.

I straightened. “You okay?”

She didn’t speak right away, just nodded and stepped inside, closing the door behind her.

Suddenly the noise from the party felt very far away.

Heather sighed, leaning back against the counter, toying with the hem of her sweater. She stood in the doorway, one hand resting on the frame, her hair slightly windblown from the open windows downstairs.

I watched her for a moment. “You sure everything’s okay?”

She smirked. “You mean, besides my now very public breakup and the fact that Tricia is probably jumping my ex as we speak?”

I shrugged. “I wasn’t gonna say it.”

Her smirk faded into something quieter, something thoughtful.

“I never really loved him.”

The words were quiet, flat. Like she had just realized it herself. 

I searched her face.

“I know.”

She huffed out a small laugh, shaking her head. “Of course you do.”

A silence stretched between us. Not awkward. Not uncomfortable. Just there.

“I needed some air,” she murmured. “Too many people downstairs. Too many…” She trailed off, then smirked. “Too many Trevors.”

I huffed out a quiet laugh. “Yeah. I figured that breakup wouldn’t exactly ruin his night.”

Heather rolled her eyes, tilting her head back. “It’s honestly embarrassing how little I care. It’s like I was dating a houseplant.”

“A very persistent houseplant.”

She laughed, really laughed, and the sound settled warm and low in my chest, curling around something I had been trying to ignore for a long time.

She looked at me then, eyes flicking down to the tub, to the steam rising off the water. “You were about to take a bath?”

I rubbed the back of my neck sheepishly. “Seemed like a better use of my time than getting trashed with the rest of them.”

She smiled, small and knowing.

“I used to picture this, you know.”

I blinked. “What?”

She hesitated, like she hadn’t meant to say it, like the words had slipped out before she could stop them.

Then she sighed, shaking her head, laughing a little at herself.

“Us,” she admitted. “Being alone like this. Away from everything. Away from… everyone.” She glanced down at her hands. “I thought, if things had gone differently, maybe we would’ve—”

She cut herself off, didn’t finish the sentence.

I glanced up at her, mentally testing the waters.

“Me too.”

I reached up, brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. The words hung between us, heavy and real. And just like that—we were somewhere else. Not in this cabin, not in this moment, but in every moment before it.

All the nights we had spent talking in hushed voices, knees touching beneath library tables, hands brushing in the dark. Every time I had looked at her and thought, just once. Just for a second.

I had never let myself have it, had never let myself want it.

Until now.

She took a step towards me, slow, measured, like she was giving me time to stop her. 

I didn’t.

She stepped closer, just enough to close the space between us, just enough to feel the warmth radiating off her skin, just enough to see the way her breath hitched slightly, the way her lips parted like she was about to say something but forgot what it was.

Her fingers brushed mine, a whisper of warmth, a question without words. 

Then she grabbed my collar, pulled me down, and kissed me.

It wasn’t slow or hesitant. It was deep and real and aching, the kind of kiss that wasn’t a mistake, wasn’t an accident, wasn’t something that could be undone.

I melted into it, into her. Into the feeling of her hands gripping the front of my shirt, pulling me closer, pressing into me like she had been waiting just as long as I had. She tasted like warmth, like whiskey and something sweet, like the taste of waking from a refreshing slumber.

My hands slid to her waist, anchoring her, pulling her against me. And for the first time in years, I wasn’t thinking, wasn’t second-guessing.

I was just here with her.

Heather pulled back, just slightly, her breath warm against my lips, her fingers still curled into my shirt.

But her eyes—her eyes had flicked to the steaming tub behind me.

And when she looked back at me, there was something new in those pools of green, something I had never seen before. Something that sent a slow, spreading heat curling through my stomach, wrapping around my ribs, creeping up my spine.

I swallowed, my throat suddenly dry.

She smiled ferociously.

I (20M) have been best friends with this girl (19F) for almost two years now, and lately, things have been feeling… different. Or maybe I’ve just finally admitted to myself that I like her.

She’s incredible—she’s got this way of making even the most boring things fun, she’s insanely smart, and she has the cutest laugh when she’s trying not to laugh. She’s super into painting, always has coffee in her hand, and she loves roses—specifically white ones. She says they’re “timeless and underrated,” which, honestly, kind of sounds like how I’d describe her.

Now, here’s where I’m confused. Lately, she’s been acting differently around me. Examples:

She texts me every morning and every night. Like, every single morning, I wake up to a “good morning, idiot” text. And before bed, it’s always, “don’t do anything stupid, loser.” (Yes, we insult each other, but in a cute way.)
She hates sharing her food, but the other day, she literally fed me a bite of her pasta with her fork. (What does that mean??)
She makes fun of me for being bad at relationships but then says, “Honestly, any girl would be lucky to have you.”
If I ever mention another girl—even casually—she goes super quiet and changes the subject.
She always finds an excuse to touch me—grabbing my hand when she’s excited, fixing my shirt, leaning on my shoulder when she’s tired.
A few nights ago, we were watching a movie, and she looked at me and said, “You know, if we’re both single by 30, we should just get married.” She laughed, but then she just… stared at me for a second before looking away.
I don’t know if I’m just seeing what I want to see, or if she actually sees me that way. I’m scared to say something and ruin what we have, but at the same time, I can’t keep pretending I don’t feel this way.

Should I just go for it and tell her? Or is there a way to test the waters without making it weird?",1,1740860064.0,Life,0,1.0,False

ALAN RUSSELL

The Ozarks were calling.

Not in the way that the woods behind town had always called to us as kids, their winding paths leading to hidden forts and treehouses and long summer days that stretched into the dusk. No, this was something else entirely. This was an escape, a chance to get away from the goddamn town and everything in it—even if just for a few days.

Heather, Mac, and I weren’t the kind of people who usually went on trips like this, the kind with too many people, too much drinking, and the constant push and pull of teenage hormones trying to sort themselves out in the dark. But Trevor Holloway had made a point of inviting us, flashing that too-white, too-perfect smile, promising a real retreat, a chance to breathe, to clear our heads.

So we packed our things.

We left.

We drove.

And for the first time in weeks, I thought that maybe, just maybe, we could outrun all of it.

The sky was still ink-dark when we left Ashwood, the kind of dark that felt heavy, settled, stretching endlessly over the road as if the sun had forgotten it was supposed to rise. The headlights carved through it, twin beams cutting the black into something tangible, the road unfolding before us in yellow lines and patches of cracked asphalt.

Mac had insisted on bringing his family’s old mutt, Biscuit, a shaggy, too-big beast that had been around longer than half the kids in our senior class. He was curled up in the back seat now, nose pressed against the cracked window, watching the trees blur past.

Heather was quiet in the passenger seat, knees tucked up, her head resting against the window. Mac was stretched out in the back, Biscuit curled up beside him, the dog’s shaggy head resting against his lap.

The road stretched long and winding through the hills, the thick green pines towering on either side, stretching toward the sky, the early evening light cutting through in long, golden beams. We were the second car in a three-car caravan, Trevor’s brand new silver Mustang leading the way, my truck in the middle, and a rusted-out old van , packed full of loud teenagers who didn’t seem to care that it was barely five in the morning bringing up the rear.

Heather sat beside me, one foot propped up on the dash, window down, the wind pulling at the ends of her hair.

“You think you packed enough?” she asked, a sly grin spreading across her face.

I glanced at the back seat.

It was full. Overpacked, really.

Boxes of ammunition for my dad’s pistol. Canned food. Sleeping bags. A shortwave radio I had spent the better part of a summer fixing up in the garage.

I hadn’t taken any chances.

“Never hurts to be prepared,” I muttered.

Mac snorted from the passenger seat, feet kicked up, arms folded behind his head.

“You’re a fucking prepper, dude.”

Heather grinned. “What do you think’s gonna happen? You think we’re gonna get lost and have to live off canned beans for a year?”

I didn’t answer. I adjusted my grip on the wheel, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror. The shoebox sat on the seat behind me, wedged between bags and supplies, nothing more than an old piece of cardboard holding the weight of the world.


The drive up into the mountains took about half an hour, the road twisting and narrowing as the world woke around us. By the time we reached the cabin, the sun had finally clawed its way over the horizon, spilling slow, golden light over the endless sea of pines.

And the cabin itself—wasn’t really a cabin at all. It was a goddamn mansion.

Log walls stretched two stories high, with a wraparound porch, thick wooden beams, and a massive stone chimney that looked like it belonged in one of those magazines rich people left on their coffee tables. A wide gravel driveway stretched before it, just big enough for all three cars to pull in and park side by side.

Trevor climbed out of his Mustang, stretching his arms above his head, grinning like he had personally built the place with his own two hands.

“Welcome to my grandpa’s little slice of heaven,” he announced, flashing that toothpaste-commercial grin.

I put the truck in park and stepped out, stretching, breathing in the clean, crisp mountain air.

Heather barely looked at him, already climbing out of my truck, grabbing her bag from the truck bed. Trevor’s eyes followed her, like a hunting dog eying its favorite toy.

I ground my teeth.

The van behind us pulled in next, doors flying open, voices spilling out into the open air—a mix of our classmates, their girlfriends, their boyfriends, a tangle of long legs and denim jackets and the unmistakable scent of cheap beer and cologne.

I recognized a few of them. There was Tricia Langley, the minister’s daughter, who had been far too cozy with Heather’s boyfriend at the last football game.
Eddie Bransford, a nice enough guy, but mostly kept to himself. I’d see him every so often holed up in the chess club room. Brandon Collins, one of our high-school’s best linemen, but continuously preceded by a thick odor that smelled like he hadn’t bathed since middle school. Jenny Parsons, our senior class valedictorian and a future politician in the making. Her hair was perpetually tied up in a ponytail, which was fitting, as I’d always thought she resembled the backside of a horse. Laura Greenfield was rich like Trevor, but a nice enough girl, if a bit airheaded. She had a habit of staring off blankly into space and saying odd things. Mac had a theory that she lost her sense of smell, because she and Brandon had been dating for four years.

There were a few others I didn’t recognize… and then there was us.

Me, Heather and Mac.

We weren’t part of their world, but for this weekend, we were.

And we would play the part.

Music played from someone’s cassette deck, faint and scratchy, the low hum of Fleetwood Mac mixing with the rustling of the wind through the leaves. Biscuit jumped out of the truck, shaking himself off and trotting toward the firepit, nose to the ground. Mac followed, stretching his arms behind his back. Heather stood beside me, watching as Trevor’s crew unloaded cases of beer from the back of the van.

Trevor didn’t leave Heather alone, not really. 
He was always there, at the edge of her space, standing too close, brushing his hand against her back as she walked, touching her arm when he laughed. If I noticed, she had to notice too.

But she didn’t say anything, didn’t push him away, didn’t tell him to back off. Because she was used to it, that it was easier to ignore it than to deal with the fallout of making a scene.

And I hated that.

Trevor was careful about it, too.

He never crossed a clear line, never did anything that couldn’t be excused as just being friendly, just being playful, just being Trevor.

But I could see it in the way Heather’s jaw tightened when he touched her. The way she kept putting space between them, only for him to find his way back in. The way she never looked at me, like she didn’t want me to see.

Trevor gave us a grand tour, walking us through the massive open living room, the kitchen that looked like it had never actually been used, the wraparound deck that overlooked the forest.

“Place has been in the family forever,” he said, pushing open one of the heavy wooden doors. “Grandpa used to bring clients up here for hunting trips, back when people still cared about that kinda thing.”

He grinned over his shoulder.

“Still got a few old rifles locked up in the basement, if anyone wants to make things interesting.”

I didn’t say anything, I didn't need to.

Heather was the one who cut him off, shoving her bag higher on her shoulder.

“Where are the bedrooms?”

Trevor smirked, arching his eyebrows as if he had been waiting for her to ask.

“Whoa, easy there, Heather. I’ve got to show our guests around first.”

Heather didn’t make any effort to conceal just how done she was with his bullshit. Trevor realized he was pushing his luck.

“Ladies get the upstairs,” he said quickly, turning toward the staircase. “Guys are down the hall.”

He turned toward me.

“Well. Most of them.”

I didn’t take the bait, just grabbed my bag and walked past him, heading straight for my room.

It was too big, that was the first thing I noticed.

Too big, too clean, too untouched, like something out of a pottery barn catalog, like no one had ever actually lived in it. The bed was massive, covered in thick blankets that looked like they had never been slept in, and the wooden floor was too polished, too smooth, reflecting the early morning light in a way that felt unnatural.

I dropped my bag onto the mattress, rolling my shoulders, feeling the exhaustion settle in.

Then—I turned to the window.

And felt something in my chest tighten.

The forest stretched out below, dark and endless, the trees swaying just slightly in the morning wind. From here, I could see the path we had driven in on, the winding dirt road cutting through the trees.

And in the distance—a figure shifted, not much, not enough to be sure.

Something too far away to make sense of, something watching.

I stepped closer to the glass, but by the time I reached it—the trees were still.

And the figure was gone.



The first thing I did after tossing my bag onto the bed was start securing the cabin.

Not physically—spiritually.

Mac had called me a prepper before, and maybe he was right. But it wasn’t paranoia. It was survival. You didn’t go through what we had and come out the other side without taking precautions.

I started with the holy water.

I moved through the cabin slow, careful, quiet—no need to let the others know what I was doing. I dipped my fingers into the first jug, letting the cold water settle against my skin, then flicked it across the windows, the doors, the baseboards of every room.

It felt ridiculous.

It should have felt ridiculous.

But it didn’t, not when I had watched Heather’s body levitate off the ground in my own goddamn living room. Not when I had felt something older than language pressing against the walls, clawing to get in. Not when I had seen the Phoenician Club burn a man to death beneath that towering stone owl.

Nothing felt ridiculous anymore.

Upstairs, I paused outside the girls’ rooms, listening for voices. Laughter spilled from inside, soft and light, the kind that only happened on trips like this, when you pretended the real world didn’t exist, when you let yourself believe that everything was fine.

I swallowed.

Then, carefully, I leaned down and poured a thin line of holy water along the threshold.

It dried fast, invisible. But it was there.

Heather didn’t need to know, didn’t need to roll her eyes or tell me I was wasting my time. Because if something came for her again, if it followed her here, it wasn’t getting past that door.

Not this time.


The basement smelled of dust and gun oil. 

It was colder than the rest of the cabin, the stone walls pressing in, lined with old wooden crates and metal shelving, an entire corner stacked with gear that looked like it hadn’t been touched in years.

I ran my hand over a crate, wiping away a layer of fine dust, fingers trailing over the heavy lid. The box wasn’t nailed shut, just weighted down.

I pushed it open and froze.

Inside—guns, not just hunting rifles. Not just a few old family heirlooms locked away for sentimental reasons. An arsenal. 

I crouched, scanning the weapons, my brain automatically sorting, categorizing, taking inventory.

Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle. .30-06 Springfield rounds, old but well-kept.

Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver. Nickel-plated, probably worth more than anything else in the room.

Remington 870 pump-action shotgun. 12-gauge shells stacked beside it.

M1 Carbine. WWII issue. Semi-automatic. Compact.

Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). A goddamn BAR—fully automatic, chambered in .30-06.

Crates of ammunition, stacked and labeled in faded black lettering. .30-06, 12-gauge, .357 Magnum, .45 ACP.


I exhaled slowly, rolling my shoulders back.

This wasn’t a hunting stash.

This was a goddamn armory. As I looked around the room, it slowly began to dawn on me, creeping in the back of my skull and filling my mind with a single, inescapable thought.

Trevor’s grandpa had really good taste in guns.


Unable to help myself, I reached for the BAR, weighing it in my hands. It was a beast of a gun, about sixteen and a half pounds unloaded. The wood furniture on it was smooth, yet well-worn. I checked to make sure the safety was still on and the chamber was clear.

Whoever had stocked this basement had known exactly what they were doing.

I made a mental note of what was here, matching it against what I had brought myself.

My Tokarev TT-33. 7.62x25mm rounds. Didn’t have as much stopping power as the Colt Python, but familiar. Reliable.

A few boxes of ammunition. Enough to last, but not enough for a war.

Canned food, purified water, sealed jugs of holy water. The essentials.

The shoebox. The evidence. The truth.

I decided to stash the  Browning Automatic Rifle, along with several boxes of .30-06 in the nearby locker, twisting the key and pocketing it. Then I headed back upstairs, joining the rest of my friends.



HEATHER ROBINSON

The sun was starting to set, dipping low over the trees, turning the sky into a patchwork of burning orange and deep indigo. The last traces of daylight stretched long and thin across the porch, spilling through the cabin’s wide-open windows, painting the wooden floors in shifting streaks of gold.

Inside, the others were already deep into their routine debauchery.

Tricia and Rachel had taken over the kitchen, laughing as they poured vodka into Solo cups, cheap liquor sloshing over the counters, soaking into the wood.

Someone had dragged the speakers from Trevor’s Mustang inside, and now music pulsed low and steady, the kind of beat that filled the walls, vibrated through the floors, settled somewhere beneath your skin.

Trevor was in his element, leaning against the counter, beer in hand, laughing too easily, flashing that too-perfect grin at any girl who happened to look his way.

It was a scene I had seen before, too many times.

Brandon Collins, was sinking into the worn leather recliner, a bottle of Jack cradled in his lap. Across from him, Laura Greenfield sat curled up on the rug, head tilted back, staring at the ceiling like she was trying to read the patterns in the wooden beams.

But my eyes were locked on Tricia Langley, the minister’s daughter who kissed like she was trying to prove something, perched on the arm of the couch, laughing at something too loudly, tilting her head just enough to make sure her hair caught the light.


I walked outside for a moment, leaning against the railing, watching the treeline, listening, alone with my thoughts.

For a while, nothing. Then—peals of laughter.

Not from inside the cabin or from the trees. From the side of the house, where the porch wrapped around toward the back, hidden from view.

I knew that laugh.

Low, rough, familiar.

I followed the sound, stepping quietly, keeping to the shadows, because I already knew what I was going to find. 

It wasn’t subtle. It never was. And sure enough—there they were. Trevor and Tricia.

Pressed up against the wooden siding, her hands in his hair, his fingers digging into her waist, leaning in close, his hand pressed flat beside her head, smirking down at her the way he used to smirk down at me.

She was smiling, her fingers toyingly trailing up his chest, her eyes half-lidded in a way that left nothing to the imagination.

They weren’t kissing, not yet.

I watched them for half a second, just long enough to feel that tiny, distant flicker of not surprise.

I didn’t feel betrayal, heartbreak, or anything resembling sadness, just a deep, gnawing exhaustion. This wasn’t the first time.

It was just the last.



Trevor didn’t see me at first. Neither did Tricia. But when I stopped just a few feet away, arms crossed, eyes steady—Trevor turned. The grin didn’t fall from his face. If anything, it widened.

“Hey, babe,” he drawled, like I hadn't just watched him pin the minister’s daughter against the wall.

Tricia smirked. I ignored her.

“You really can’t help yourself, can you?” My voice was calm, almost detached.

Trevor shrugged, taking a slow sip from his beer. “What are you talking about?”

I let out a breath, shaking my head.

“I’m done.”

He blinked for a moment, the meaning of my words taking a moment to penetrate his thick skull. Then—he laughed. A real, full-bodied laugh, like this was the funniest thing he had ever heard.

“You’re breaking up with me?”

He took a step forward, smelling like beer and expensive cologne, that cocky smirk still glued to his face.

“Come on, babe, don’t be like that,” he murmured, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear.

I caught his wrist before he could touch me.

“I said I’m done.”

His fingers twitched beneath mine. For a second, I thought he might say something else, might try to convince me, manipulate me, try to pull me back in like he always did.

But then he saw it the way I was looking at him, not with anger or pain. And I think, for the first time, gazing into the pools of pure apathy in my eyes, Trevor Holloway realized he had lost.

I let go of his wrist, then I walked away and didn’t look back. I walked back toward the front of the house, where  Mac was standing by the door, beer in hand, watching me.
I exhaled, rolling my shoulders, shaking off the tension like it was just another thing to deal with.

“Didn’t last long this time,” Mac muttered.

I smirked. “Not even a full week.”

I let a full grin spread across my face, reveling in the moment.

“But I made sure it was the last time.”

I pushed past him into the house, grabbing a beer from the counter.

Trevor came in a minute later, his hair a little messier, his collar slightly askew. He didn’t meet my eyes.

The night stretched on, swallowing the last light of day, wrapping the cabin in thick, endless black. The trees swayed lazily in the wind, their rustling just barely audible over the thrum of music and laughter spilling from the open windows.

The air had changed.

Not suddenly. Not all at once. But slowly, gradually, the way the light shifts in the late afternoon when a storm is creeping in, when the sun still shines but the sky turns just a little too dark at the edges, like something vast and heavy is waiting beyond the clouds.

The party was still going. The music was still pulsing, the bottles still clinking, the laughter still ringing through the rooms, but it was different now—something about the sound felt thinner, stretched too tight, like the noise wasn’t bouncing off the walls the way it should, like the cabin had grown larger, swallowing it whole.

Even inside, I could feel the trees pressing in.

And I wasn’t the only one.

“I don’t like it,” Eddie muttered, his voice barely carrying over the music. He had stationed himself near the fireplace, still nursing the same beer he had opened an hour ago, his book tucked under his arm like a security blanket.

Brandon Collins, red-faced and swaying slightly from one too many Jack-and-Cokes, huffed and waved him off. “You don’t like anything, man.”

Eddie frowned, his eyes flicking toward the window. “No, seriously. Something’s… off.”

Jenny Parsons was perched on the couch, one leg crossed over the other, her sharp, ever-watchful gaze following the conversation. She tapped her fingers against the armrest, considering.

“I heard it too,” she admitted.

Tricia, still glowing with the satisfaction of having gotten what she wanted from Trevor, rolled her eyes. “Oh, please. You guys are like a bunch of kids getting scared over ghost stories. It’s probably just a squirrel. Or—” She smirked. “Maybe it’s Bigfoot.”

Laura, still curled up on the rug at Brandon’s feet, twirled a strand of hair around her fingers, her expression eerily blank. “It doesn’t feel like raccoons,” she murmured.

The room got a little quieter.

“Uh… honey? What the hell does that mean?” Brandon asked, shifting uncomfortably.

Laura didn’t answer. She just kept staring into the grain of the wooden ceiling.




It was hard to tell when the sound started.

Maybe it had been there all along—too soft at first, too distant, too easily dismissed.

But now, it was undeniable. A rhythmic rustling in the trees, not frantic, not wild, not the careless movement of an animal searching for food—but slow. Deliberate.

Like footsteps.

Brandon turned his head toward the window, brow furrowing. “Okay, that? That wasn’t a fucking squirrel.”

A few of the others laughed, but it wasn’t real. It was forced, tight, the kind of laugh that came when someone was trying too hard to shake off a feeling they didn’t want to have.

Eddie stood, moving to the window. He pressed a palm against the glass, peering out into the darkness.

“I don’t see anything,” he muttered.

The wind pushed against the cabin, the sound of the trees bending and groaning filling the silence left in the wake of his words.

Then—a snap.

Loud. Clear. A branch breaking under the weight of something. Someone.

The music kept playing, but nobody was listening anymore.

Jenny stood, smoothing down her sweater. “Alright, I think this has gone on long enough. Trevor, you have, what, a rifle somewhere in this place? Why don’t you go outside and scare off whatever it is before Eddie has a heart attack?”

Trevor smirked, but it was weaker this time.

“Oh, sure. Let me just go out and get mauled by a bear for your amusement.”

Mac, who had been unusually quiet, leaned against the counter, sipping his beer. “You think it’s a bear?”

Trevor scoffed. “What else would it be?”

Mac shrugged.

“Well, I’m sure I don’t know, Trevor.”

The wind picked up again, whistling through the trees, carrying with it the deep, dense scent of damp earth and pine.

And beneath it—something else, bitter and rotten.

Brandon gagged. “Jesus, what is that?”

Jenny covered her nose. “God, it smells like something crawled under the porch and died.”

Eddie was still at the window.

Still watching.

And I saw it in his posture, in the way his hand tensed against the glass, in the way his breath caught just slightly in his throat.

He saw something.

“Eddie?” I prompted.

His fingers curled into a fist.

“I think there’s someone out there.”



The music cut out first, dropping the room into an abrupt, suffocating silence.

The lights flickered, once, twice, and then the cabin went dark.

Someone yelped.

Brandon cursed. “Oh, fuck this. Where’s the goddamn generator?”

Nobody moved.

I was close enough to see Mac, barely a shadow in the dark, his hand slowly reaching toward his belt.

And from outside—from the deep, yawning blackness of the trees—came the sound of something dragging across the porch.

A slow, scraping sound, like nails against wood.

Or claws.


The silence in the cabin was thick and absolute, like the darkness outside had slithered its way in through the cracks, filling the empty spaces between us, curling around our throats, pressing its weight into our chests.

For a long moment, nobody spoke.

Nobody moved.

The only sound was the slow, agonizing scrape of something outside, dragging its way across the porch—deliberate, unhurried, like whatever was out there had all the time in the world.

Then—

Brandon swallowed hard. “Somebody should get a gun.”

The words landed heavy in the room.

Trevor scoffed, but the usual arrogance in his voice was thinner now, stretched tight beneath something he didn’t want us to hear. “Jesus, Brandon. It’s probably just some animal.”

“Yeah? And if it’s not?” Jenny cut in, arms folded tight across her chest. “You’ve got a goddamn arsenal down there, don’t you? Maybe now would be a good time to stop pretending you’re not freaked out too.”

Trevor hesitated.

Then—

He smirked. “Fine. But when I come back and it turns out to be a deer or some stoned camper looking for a place to piss, I get to say I told you so.”

Nobody laughed.

Nobody even cracked a smile.

He exhaled sharply, then turned and disappeared down the basement stairs.

The moment he was gone, the room felt emptier.

The wind outside sighed through the trees, rattling the windows, making the wooden beams of the cabin groan under their own weight.

Trevor was taking too long.

Brandon shifted uncomfortably. “Shouldn’t he be back by now?”

Jenny shot him a look. “Maybe don’t say ominous shit like that when we’re all already freaked out.”

Eddie was still at the window, watching. He hadn’t spoken in a while, but I could see it in his posture—something was wrong. The dragging sound on the porch had stopped.

That should’ve made me feel better, but it didn’t.

The basement door swung open, louder than it needed to, making a few people jump.

Trevor strode back into the room, a Winchester rifle slung over his shoulder, Colt Python dangling from his fingers, smirking like this was all some elaborate joke and he was just waiting for the punchline.

“Happy now?” he drawled, dropping both weapons onto the counter with a solid thud.

Brandon let out a slow breath. “Much.”

The shift was almost immediate.

The weight in the room eased, just a little. The silence didn’t feel so oppressive anymore. Mac stepped forward first, reaching for the rifle, running a hand over the wood, checking the chamber.

“Loaded?”

Trevor scoffed. “Of course it’s loaded.”

Mac smirked, but there wasn’t much humor in it. “For once, you’re actually useful.”

Trevor rolled his eyes, already reaching for another drink. Somewhere in the depths of the cabin, a faint hum started. A second later, the lights flickered once, twice—then flared back to life. A collective breath rushed out of the room.

Brandon let out a short, breathy laugh, shaking his head. “Well, that was fucking creepy.”

Jenny sighed, smoothing down her sweater. “Alright. Crisis averted. Somebody turn the damn music back on.”

The tension in the room cracked, not all at once, but in slow, cautious fractures—first in the way Brandon reached for his drink again, then in the way Tricia threw herself back onto the couch with a theatrical sigh, then in the way Mac, still gripping the rifle, leaned against the counter and smirked at me.

“You look disappointed,” he murmured.

I raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?”

“Yeah.” He tilted his head. “What, were you hoping it was Bigfoot?”

I huffed out a laugh. “Just hoping it was something we could shoot.”

Trevor’s laugh was too loud, too forced. “Christ, you people are paranoid.”

I ignored him.

Eddie lingered by the window, eyes still flicking between the trees, fingers still tense against the glass.

But the music started up again, and the bottles clinked, and soon the air was buzzing once more with easy laughter and the warmth of cheap liquor and the glow of artificial light.


ALAN RUSSELL



The night had settled into something slow and hazy, its edges softened by alcohol and flickering candlelight, the low hum of conversation and music pulsing beneath the wooden beams of the cabin.

Downstairs, the party was still going, but the worst of it had passed—the reckless, feverish energy had given way to something lazier, sleepier, more indulgent, the kind of drunk that had people curling into corners, voices hushed, movements slow. The tension from earlier had faded into something quieter, something that could almost be mistaken for comfort.

But it wasn’t gone.

It had just buried itself beneath the noise.

I wasn’t drinking.

Not because I had any moral objection to it, but because I wanted to keep my head clear. Something still felt off, something I couldn’t quite name, and I wasn’t about to let myself sink into the same haze as the rest of them.

I envied them.

Not because they were having fun, but because they could pretend. Because they could drink themselves into a haze and let themselves believe, even for a night, that the world outside this cabin wasn’t rotting, that the things lurking in the dark weren’t real, that nothing was waiting for them beyond the tree line.

I couldn’t do that.

So I had excused myself, leaving behind the glow of the fire and the warmth of the party, making my way to my bathroom—attached to the massive room that was my bedroom, far enough away from the main floor that I could almost pretend I was alone up here, separate from the noise, the alcohol, the heavy scent of cigarette smoke wafting through the halls.

I dipped my hand into the warm holy water that filled the clawfoot tub, watching as steam curled lazily into the air, spreading through the dimly lit room like a breath. The scent of minerals hung in the air, clean and sharp.

Holy water.

I had boiled it first, let it settle, then cooled it down just enough to be tolerable.

A stupid idea, probably. 

But if it worked—if it did anything at all—then maybe I had finally found a way to fight back. Maybe I had found something that could keep the things in the dark away for good.

If I could climb into that water and come out whole, untouched, untouchable—then maybe I had found something real, something I could fight back with.

I took a deep breath, leaning against the sink.

There was a soft knock on the door.

I turned my head, eyes searching for the mysterious late-night visitor.

Heather was standing in the doorway, one hand resting against the frame, her hair slightly tousled, her cheeks flushed just a little too pink. She wasn’t drunk, not really, but she was loose, the sharp edges of her usual guarded expression softened, smoothed over by just enough alcohol to make her brave.

I straightened. “You okay?”

She didn’t speak right away, just nodded and stepped inside, closing the door behind her.

Suddenly the noise from the party felt very far away.

Heather sighed, leaning back against the counter, toying with the hem of her sweater. She stood in the doorway, one hand resting on the frame, her hair slightly windblown from the open windows downstairs.

I watched her for a moment. “You sure everything’s okay?”

She smirked. “You mean, besides my now very public breakup and the fact that Tricia is probably jumping my ex as we speak?”

I shrugged. “I wasn’t gonna say it.”

Her smirk faded into something quieter, something thoughtful.

“I never really loved him.”

The words were quiet, flat. Like she had just realized it herself. 

I searched her face.

“I know.”

She huffed out a small laugh, shaking her head. “Of course you do.”

A silence stretched between us. Not awkward. Not uncomfortable. Just there.

“I needed some air,” she murmured. “Too many people downstairs. Too many…” She trailed off, then smirked. “Too many Trevors.”

I huffed out a quiet laugh. “Yeah. I figured that breakup wouldn’t exactly ruin his night.”

Heather rolled her eyes, tilting her head back. “It’s honestly embarrassing how little I care. It’s like I was dating a houseplant.”

“A very persistent houseplant.”

She laughed, really laughed, and the sound settled warm and low in my chest, curling around something I had been trying to ignore for a long time.

She looked at me then, eyes flicking down to the tub, to the steam rising off the water. “You were about to take a bath?”

I rubbed the back of my neck sheepishly. “Seemed like a better use of my time than getting trashed with the rest of them.”

She smiled, small and knowing.

“I used to picture this, you know.”

I blinked. “What?”

She hesitated, like she hadn’t meant to say it, like the words had slipped out before she could stop them.

Then she sighed, shaking her head, laughing a little at herself.

“Us,” she admitted. “Being alone like this. Away from everything. Away from… everyone.” She glanced down at her hands. “I thought, if things had gone differently, maybe we would’ve—”

She cut herself off, didn’t finish the sentence.

I glanced up at her, mentally testing the waters.

“Me too.”

I reached up, brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. The words hung between us, heavy and real. And just like that—we were somewhere else. Not in this cabin, not in this moment, but in every moment before it.

All the nights we had spent talking in hushed voices, knees touching beneath library tables, hands brushing in the dark. Every time I had looked at her and thought, just once. Just for a second.

I had never let myself have it, had never let myself want it.

Until now.

She took a step towards me, slow, measured, like she was giving me time to stop her. 

I didn’t.

She stepped closer, just enough to close the space between us, just enough to feel the warmth radiating off her skin, just enough to see the way her breath hitched slightly, the way her lips parted like she was about to say something but forgot what it was.

Her fingers brushed mine, a whisper of warmth, a question without words. 

Then she grabbed my collar, pulled me down, and kissed me.

It wasn’t slow or hesitant. It was deep and real and aching, the kind of kiss that wasn’t a mistake, wasn’t an accident, wasn’t something that could be undone.

I melted into it, into her. Into the feeling of her hands gripping the front of my shirt, pulling me closer, pressing into me like she had been waiting just as long as I had. She tasted like warmth, like whiskey and something sweet, like the taste of waking from a refreshing slumber.

My hands slid to her waist, anchoring her, pulling her against me. And for the first time in years, I wasn’t thinking, wasn’t second-guessing.

I was just here with her.

Heather pulled back, just slightly, her breath warm against my lips, her fingers still curled into my shirt.

But her eyes—her eyes had flicked to the steaming tub behind me.

And when she looked back at me, there was something new in those pools of green, something I had never seen before. Something that sent a slow, spreading heat curling through my stomach, wrapping around my ribs, creeping up my spine.

I swallowed, my throat suddenly dry.

She smiled ferociously.

ALAN RUSSELL

The Ozarks were calling.

Not in the way that the woods behind town had always called to us as kids, their winding paths leading to hidden forts and treehouses and long summer days that stretched into the dusk. No, this was something else entirely. This was an escape, a chance to get away from the goddamn town and everything in it—even if just for a few days.

Heather, Mac, and I weren’t the kind of people who usually went on trips like this, the kind with too many people, too much drinking, and the constant push and pull of teenage hormones trying to sort themselves out in the dark. But Trevor Holloway had made a point of inviting us, flashing that too-white, too-perfect smile, promising a real retreat, a chance to breathe, to clear our heads.

So we packed our things.

We left.

We drove.

And for the first time in weeks, I thought that maybe, just maybe, we could outrun all of it.

The sky was still ink-dark when we left Ashwood, the kind of dark that felt heavy, settled, stretching endlessly over the road as if the sun had forgotten it was supposed to rise. The headlights carved through it, twin beams cutting the black into something tangible, the road unfolding before us in yellow lines and patches of cracked asphalt.

Mac had insisted on bringing his family’s old mutt, Biscuit, a shaggy, too-big beast that had been around longer than half the kids in our senior class. He was curled up in the back seat now, nose pressed against the cracked window, watching the trees blur past.

Heather was quiet in the passenger seat, knees tucked up, her head resting against the window. Mac was stretched out in the back, Biscuit curled up beside him, the dog’s shaggy head resting against his lap.

The road stretched long and winding through the hills, the thick green pines towering on either side, stretching toward the sky, the early evening light cutting through in long, golden beams. We were the second car in a three-car caravan, Trevor’s brand new silver Mustang leading the way, my truck in the middle, and a rusted-out old van , packed full of loud teenagers who didn’t seem to care that it was barely five in the morning bringing up the rear.

Heather sat beside me, one foot propped up on the dash, window down, the wind pulling at the ends of her hair.

“You think you packed enough?” she asked, a sly grin spreading across her face.

I glanced at the back seat.

It was full. Overpacked, really.

Boxes of ammunition for my dad’s pistol. Canned food. Sleeping bags. A shortwave radio I had spent the better part of a summer fixing up in the garage.

I hadn’t taken any chances.

“Never hurts to be prepared,” I muttered.

Mac snorted from the passenger seat, feet kicked up, arms folded behind his head.

“You’re a fucking prepper, dude.”

Heather grinned. “What do you think’s gonna happen? You think we’re gonna get lost and have to live off canned beans for a year?”

I didn’t answer. I adjusted my grip on the wheel, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror. The shoebox sat on the seat behind me, wedged between bags and supplies, nothing more than an old piece of cardboard holding the weight of the world.


The drive up into the mountains took about half an hour, the road twisting and narrowing as the world woke around us. By the time we reached the cabin, the sun had finally clawed its way over the horizon, spilling slow, golden light over the endless sea of pines.

And the cabin itself—wasn’t really a cabin at all. It was a goddamn mansion.

Log walls stretched two stories high, with a wraparound porch, thick wooden beams, and a massive stone chimney that looked like it belonged in one of those magazines rich people left on their coffee tables. A wide gravel driveway stretched before it, just big enough for all three cars to pull in and park side by side.

Trevor climbed out of his Mustang, stretching his arms above his head, grinning like he had personally built the place with his own two hands.

“Welcome to my grandpa’s little slice of heaven,” he announced, flashing that toothpaste-commercial grin.

I put the truck in park and stepped out, stretching, breathing in the clean, crisp mountain air.

Heather barely looked at him, already climbing out of my truck, grabbing her bag from the truck bed. Trevor’s eyes followed her, like a hunting dog eying its favorite toy.

I ground my teeth.

The van behind us pulled in next, doors flying open, voices spilling out into the open air—a mix of our classmates, their girlfriends, their boyfriends, a tangle of long legs and denim jackets and the unmistakable scent of cheap beer and cologne.

I recognized a few of them. There was Tricia Langley, the minister’s daughter, who had been far too cozy with Heather’s boyfriend at the last football game.
Eddie Bransford, a nice enough guy, but mostly kept to himself. I’d see him every so often holed up in the chess club room. Brandon Collins, one of our high-school’s best linemen, but continuously preceded by a thick odor that smelled like he hadn’t bathed since middle school. Jenny Parsons, our senior class valedictorian and a future politician in the making. Her hair was perpetually tied up in a ponytail, which was fitting, as I’d always thought she resembled the backside of a horse. Laura Greenfield was rich like Trevor, but a nice enough girl, if a bit airheaded. She had a habit of staring off blankly into space and saying odd things. Mac had a theory that she lost her sense of smell, because she and Brandon had been dating for four years.

There were a few others I didn’t recognize… and then there was us.

Me, Heather and Mac.

We weren’t part of their world, but for this weekend, we were.

And we would play the part.

Music played from someone’s cassette deck, faint and scratchy, the low hum of Fleetwood Mac mixing with the rustling of the wind through the leaves. Biscuit jumped out of the truck, shaking himself off and trotting toward the firepit, nose to the ground. Mac followed, stretching his arms behind his back. Heather stood beside me, watching as Trevor’s crew unloaded cases of beer from the back of the van.

Trevor didn’t leave Heather alone, not really. 
He was always there, at the edge of her space, standing too close, brushing his hand against her back as she walked, touching her arm when he laughed. If I noticed, she had to notice too.

But she didn’t say anything, didn’t push him away, didn’t tell him to back off. Because she was used to it, that it was easier to ignore it than to deal with the fallout of making a scene.

And I hated that.

Trevor was careful about it, too.

He never crossed a clear line, never did anything that couldn’t be excused as just being friendly, just being playful, just being Trevor.

But I could see it in the way Heather’s jaw tightened when he touched her. The way she kept putting space between them, only for him to find his way back in. The way she never looked at me, like she didn’t want me to see.

Trevor gave us a grand tour, walking us through the massive open living room, the kitchen that looked like it had never actually been used, the wraparound deck that overlooked the forest.

“Place has been in the family forever,” he said, pushing open one of the heavy wooden doors. “Grandpa used to bring clients up here for hunting trips, back when people still cared about that kinda thing.”

He grinned over his shoulder.

“Still got a few old rifles locked up in the basement, if anyone wants to make things interesting.”

I didn’t say anything, I didn't need to.

Heather was the one who cut him off, shoving her bag higher on her shoulder.

“Where are the bedrooms?”

Trevor smirked, arching his eyebrows as if he had been waiting for her to ask.

“Whoa, easy there, Heather. I’ve got to show our guests around first.”

Heather didn’t make any effort to conceal just how done she was with his bullshit. Trevor realized he was pushing his luck.

“Ladies get the upstairs,” he said quickly, turning toward the staircase. “Guys are down the hall.”

He turned toward me.

“Well. Most of them.”

I didn’t take the bait, just grabbed my bag and walked past him, heading straight for my room.

It was too big, that was the first thing I noticed.

Too big, too clean, too untouched, like something out of a pottery barn catalog, like no one had ever actually lived in it. The bed was massive, covered in thick blankets that looked like they had never been slept in, and the wooden floor was too polished, too smooth, reflecting the early morning light in a way that felt unnatural.

I dropped my bag onto the mattress, rolling my shoulders, feeling the exhaustion settle in.

Then—I turned to the window.

And felt something in my chest tighten.

The forest stretched out below, dark and endless, the trees swaying just slightly in the morning wind. From here, I could see the path we had driven in on, the winding dirt road cutting through the trees.

And in the distance—a figure shifted, not much, not enough to be sure.

Something too far away to make sense of, something watching.

I stepped closer to the glass, but by the time I reached it—the trees were still.

And the figure was gone.



The first thing I did after tossing my bag onto the bed was start securing the cabin.

Not physically—spiritually.

Mac had called me a prepper before, and maybe he was right. But it wasn’t paranoia. It was survival. You didn’t go through what we had and come out the other side without taking precautions.

I started with the holy water.

I moved through the cabin slow, careful, quiet—no need to let the others know what I was doing. I dipped my fingers into the first jug, letting the cold water settle against my skin, then flicked it across the windows, the doors, the baseboards of every room.

It felt ridiculous.

It should have felt ridiculous.

But it didn’t, not when I had watched Heather’s body levitate off the ground in my own goddamn living room. Not when I had felt something older than language pressing against the walls, clawing to get in. Not when I had seen the Phoenician Club burn a man to death beneath that towering stone owl.

Nothing felt ridiculous anymore.

Upstairs, I paused outside the girls’ rooms, listening for voices. Laughter spilled from inside, soft and light, the kind that only happened on trips like this, when you pretended the real world didn’t exist, when you let yourself believe that everything was fine.

I swallowed.

Then, carefully, I leaned down and poured a thin line of holy water along the threshold.

It dried fast, invisible. But it was there.

Heather didn’t need to know, didn’t need to roll her eyes or tell me I was wasting my time. Because if something came for her again, if it followed her here, it wasn’t getting past that door.

Not this time.


The basement smelled of dust and gun oil. 

It was colder than the rest of the cabin, the stone walls pressing in, lined with old wooden crates and metal shelving, an entire corner stacked with gear that looked like it hadn’t been touched in years.

I ran my hand over a crate, wiping away a layer of fine dust, fingers trailing over the heavy lid. The box wasn’t nailed shut, just weighted down.

I pushed it open and froze.

Inside—guns, not just hunting rifles. Not just a few old family heirlooms locked away for sentimental reasons. An arsenal. 

I crouched, scanning the weapons, my brain automatically sorting, categorizing, taking inventory.

Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle. .30-06 Springfield rounds, old but well-kept.

Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver. Nickel-plated, probably worth more than anything else in the room.

Remington 870 pump-action shotgun. 12-gauge shells stacked beside it.

M1 Carbine. WWII issue. Semi-automatic. Compact.

Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). A goddamn BAR—fully automatic, chambered in .30-06.

Crates of ammunition, stacked and labeled in faded black lettering. .30-06, 12-gauge, .357 Magnum, .45 ACP.


I exhaled slowly, rolling my shoulders back.

This wasn’t a hunting stash.

This was a goddamn armory. As I looked around the room, it slowly began to dawn on me, creeping in the back of my skull and filling my mind with a single, inescapable thought.

Trevor’s grandpa had really good taste in guns.


Unable to help myself, I reached for the BAR, weighing it in my hands. It was a beast of a gun, about sixteen and a half pounds unloaded. The wood furniture on it was smooth, yet well-worn. I checked to make sure the safety was still on and the chamber was clear.

Whoever had stocked this basement had known exactly what they were doing.

I made a mental note of what was here, matching it against what I had brought myself.

My Tokarev TT-33. 7.62x25mm rounds. Didn’t have as much stopping power as the Colt Python, but familiar. Reliable.

A few boxes of ammunition. Enough to last, but not enough for a war.

Canned food, purified water, sealed jugs of holy water. The essentials.

The shoebox. The evidence. The truth.

I decided to stash the  Browning Automatic Rifle, along with several boxes of .30-06 in the nearby locker, twisting the key and pocketing it. Then I headed back upstairs, joining the rest of my friends.



HEATHER ROBINSON

The sun was starting to set, dipping low over the trees, turning the sky into a patchwork of burning orange and deep indigo. The last traces of daylight stretched long and thin across the porch, spilling through the cabin’s wide-open windows, painting the wooden floors in shifting streaks of gold.

Inside, the others were already deep into their routine debauchery.

Tricia and Rachel had taken over the kitchen, laughing as they poured vodka into Solo cups, cheap liquor sloshing over the counters, soaking into the wood.

Someone had dragged the speakers from Trevor’s Mustang inside, and now music pulsed low and steady, the kind of beat that filled the walls, vibrated through the floors, settled somewhere beneath your skin.

Trevor was in his element, leaning against the counter, beer in hand, laughing too easily, flashing that too-perfect grin at any girl who happened to look his way.

It was a scene I had seen before, too many times.

Brandon Collins, was sinking into the worn leather recliner, a bottle of Jack cradled in his lap. Across from him, Laura Greenfield sat curled up on the rug, head tilted back, staring at the ceiling like she was trying to read the patterns in the wooden beams.

But my eyes were locked on Tricia Langley, the minister’s daughter who kissed like she was trying to prove something, perched on the arm of the couch, laughing at something too loudly, tilting her head just enough to make sure her hair caught the light.


I walked outside for a moment, leaning against the railing, watching the treeline, listening, alone with my thoughts.

For a while, nothing. Then—peals of laughter.

Not from inside the cabin or from the trees. From the side of the house, where the porch wrapped around toward the back, hidden from view.

I knew that laugh.

Low, rough, familiar.

I followed the sound, stepping quietly, keeping to the shadows, because I already knew what I was going to find. 

It wasn’t subtle. It never was. And sure enough—there they were. Trevor and Tricia.

Pressed up against the wooden siding, her hands in his hair, his fingers digging into her waist, leaning in close, his hand pressed flat beside her head, smirking down at her the way he used to smirk down at me.

She was smiling, her fingers toyingly trailing up his chest, her eyes half-lidded in a way that left nothing to the imagination.

They weren’t kissing, not yet.

I watched them for half a second, just long enough to feel that tiny, distant flicker of not surprise.

I didn’t feel betrayal, heartbreak, or anything resembling sadness, just a deep, gnawing exhaustion. This wasn’t the first time.

It was just the last.



Trevor didn’t see me at first. Neither did Tricia. But when I stopped just a few feet away, arms crossed, eyes steady—Trevor turned. The grin didn’t fall from his face. If anything, it widened.

“Hey, babe,” he drawled, like I hadn't just watched him pin the minister’s daughter against the wall.

Tricia smirked. I ignored her.

“You really can’t help yourself, can you?” My voice was calm, almost detached.

Trevor shrugged, taking a slow sip from his beer. “What are you talking about?”

I let out a breath, shaking my head.

“I’m done.”

He blinked for a moment, the meaning of my words taking a moment to penetrate his thick skull. Then—he laughed. A real, full-bodied laugh, like this was the funniest thing he had ever heard.

“You’re breaking up with me?”

He took a step forward, smelling like beer and expensive cologne, that cocky smirk still glued to his face.

“Come on, babe, don’t be like that,” he murmured, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear.

I caught his wrist before he could touch me.

“I said I’m done.”

His fingers twitched beneath mine. For a second, I thought he might say something else, might try to convince me, manipulate me, try to pull me back in like he always did.

But then he saw it the way I was looking at him, not with anger or pain. And I think, for the first time, gazing into the pools of pure apathy in my eyes, Trevor Holloway realized he had lost.

I let go of his wrist, then I walked away and didn’t look back. I walked back toward the front of the house, where  Mac was standing by the door, beer in hand, watching me.
I exhaled, rolling my shoulders, shaking off the tension like it was just another thing to deal with.

“Didn’t last long this time,” Mac muttered.

I smirked. “Not even a full week.”

I let a full grin spread across my face, reveling in the moment.

“But I made sure it was the last time.”

I pushed past him into the house, grabbing a beer from the counter.

Trevor came in a minute later, his hair a little messier, his collar slightly askew. He didn’t meet my eyes.

The night stretched on, swallowing the last light of day, wrapping the cabin in thick, endless black. The trees swayed lazily in the wind, their rustling just barely audible over the thrum of music and laughter spilling from the open windows.

The air had changed.

Not suddenly. Not all at once. But slowly, gradually, the way the light shifts in the late afternoon when a storm is creeping in, when the sun still shines but the sky turns just a little too dark at the edges, like something vast and heavy is waiting beyond the clouds.

The party was still going. The music was still pulsing, the bottles still clinking, the laughter still ringing through the rooms, but it was different now—something about the sound felt thinner, stretched too tight, like the noise wasn’t bouncing off the walls the way it should, like the cabin had grown larger, swallowing it whole.

Even inside, I could feel the trees pressing in.

And I wasn’t the only one.

“I don’t like it,” Eddie muttered, his voice barely carrying over the music. He had stationed himself near the fireplace, still nursing the same beer he had opened an hour ago, his book tucked under his arm like a security blanket.

Brandon Collins, red-faced and swaying slightly from one too many Jack-and-Cokes, huffed and waved him off. “You don’t like anything, man.”

Eddie frowned, his eyes flicking toward the window. “No, seriously. Something’s… off.”

Jenny Parsons was perched on the couch, one leg crossed over the other, her sharp, ever-watchful gaze following the conversation. She tapped her fingers against the armrest, considering.

“I heard it too,” she admitted.

Tricia, still glowing with the satisfaction of having gotten what she wanted from Trevor, rolled her eyes. “Oh, please. You guys are like a bunch of kids getting scared over ghost stories. It’s probably just a squirrel. Or—” She smirked. “Maybe it’s Bigfoot.”

Laura, still curled up on the rug at Brandon’s feet, twirled a strand of hair around her fingers, her expression eerily blank. “It doesn’t feel like raccoons,” she murmured.

The room got a little quieter.

“Uh… honey? What the hell does that mean?” Brandon asked, shifting uncomfortably.

Laura didn’t answer. She just kept staring into the grain of the wooden ceiling.




It was hard to tell when the sound started.

Maybe it had been there all along—too soft at first, too distant, too easily dismissed.

But now, it was undeniable. A rhythmic rustling in the trees, not frantic, not wild, not the careless movement of an animal searching for food—but slow. Deliberate.

Like footsteps.

Brandon turned his head toward the window, brow furrowing. “Okay, that? That wasn’t a fucking squirrel.”

A few of the others laughed, but it wasn’t real. It was forced, tight, the kind of laugh that came when someone was trying too hard to shake off a feeling they didn’t want to have.

Eddie stood, moving to the window. He pressed a palm against the glass, peering out into the darkness.

“I don’t see anything,” he muttered.

The wind pushed against the cabin, the sound of the trees bending and groaning filling the silence left in the wake of his words.

Then—a snap.

Loud. Clear. A branch breaking under the weight of something. Someone.

The music kept playing, but nobody was listening anymore.

Jenny stood, smoothing down her sweater. “Alright, I think this has gone on long enough. Trevor, you have, what, a rifle somewhere in this place? Why don’t you go outside and scare off whatever it is before Eddie has a heart attack?”

Trevor smirked, but it was weaker this time.

“Oh, sure. Let me just go out and get mauled by a bear for your amusement.”

Mac, who had been unusually quiet, leaned against the counter, sipping his beer. “You think it’s a bear?”

Trevor scoffed. “What else would it be?”

Mac shrugged.

“Well, I’m sure I don’t know, Trevor.”

The wind picked up again, whistling through the trees, carrying with it the deep, dense scent of damp earth and pine.

And beneath it—something else, bitter and rotten.

Brandon gagged. “Jesus, what is that?”

Jenny covered her nose. “God, it smells like something crawled under the porch and died.”

Eddie was still at the window.

Still watching.

And I saw it in his posture, in the way his hand tensed against the glass, in the way his breath caught just slightly in his throat.

He saw something.

“Eddie?” I prompted.

His fingers curled into a fist.

“I think there’s someone out there.”



The music cut out first, dropping the room into an abrupt, suffocating silence.

The lights flickered, once, twice, and then the cabin went dark.

Someone yelped.

Brandon cursed. “Oh, fuck this. Where’s the goddamn generator?”

Nobody moved.

I was close enough to see Mac, barely a shadow in the dark, his hand slowly reaching toward his belt.

And from outside—from the deep, yawning blackness of the trees—came the sound of something dragging across the porch.

A slow, scraping sound, like nails against wood.

Or claws.


The silence in the cabin was thick and absolute, like the darkness outside had slithered its way in through the cracks, filling the empty spaces between us, curling around our throats, pressing its weight into our chests.

For a long moment, nobody spoke.

Nobody moved.

The only sound was the slow, agonizing scrape of something outside, dragging its way across the porch—deliberate, unhurried, like whatever was out there had all the time in the world.

Then—

Brandon swallowed hard. “Somebody should get a gun.”

The words landed heavy in the room.

Trevor scoffed, but the usual arrogance in his voice was thinner now, stretched tight beneath something he didn’t want us to hear. “Jesus, Brandon. It’s probably just some animal.”

“Yeah? And if it’s not?” Jenny cut in, arms folded tight across her chest. “You’ve got a goddamn arsenal down there, don’t you? Maybe now would be a good time to stop pretending you’re not freaked out too.”

Trevor hesitated.

Then—

He smirked. “Fine. But when I come back and it turns out to be a deer or some stoned camper looking for a place to piss, I get to say I told you so.”

Nobody laughed.

Nobody even cracked a smile.

He exhaled sharply, then turned and disappeared down the basement stairs.

The moment he was gone, the room felt emptier.

The wind outside sighed through the trees, rattling the windows, making the wooden beams of the cabin groan under their own weight.

Trevor was taking too long.

Brandon shifted uncomfortably. “Shouldn’t he be back by now?”

Jenny shot him a look. “Maybe don’t say ominous shit like that when we’re all already freaked out.”

Eddie was still at the window, watching. He hadn’t spoken in a while, but I could see it in his posture—something was wrong. The dragging sound on the porch had stopped.

That should’ve made me feel better, but it didn’t.

The basement door swung open, louder than it needed to, making a few people jump.

Trevor strode back into the room, a Winchester rifle slung over his shoulder, Colt Python dangling from his fingers, smirking like this was all some elaborate joke and he was just waiting for the punchline.

“Happy now?” he drawled, dropping both weapons onto the counter with a solid thud.

Brandon let out a slow breath. “Much.”

The shift was almost immediate.

The weight in the room eased, just a little. The silence didn’t feel so oppressive anymore. Mac stepped forward first, reaching for the rifle, running a hand over the wood, checking the chamber.

“Loaded?”

Trevor scoffed. “Of course it’s loaded.”

Mac smirked, but there wasn’t much humor in it. “For once, you’re actually useful.”

Trevor rolled his eyes, already reaching for another drink. Somewhere in the depths of the cabin, a faint hum started. A second later, the lights flickered once, twice—then flared back to life. A collective breath rushed out of the room.

Brandon let out a short, breathy laugh, shaking his head. “Well, that was fucking creepy.”

Jenny sighed, smoothing down her sweater. “Alright. Crisis averted. Somebody turn the damn music back on.”

The tension in the room cracked, not all at once, but in slow, cautious fractures—first in the way Brandon reached for his drink again, then in the way Tricia threw herself back onto the couch with a theatrical sigh, then in the way Mac, still gripping the rifle, leaned against the counter and smirked at me.

“You look disappointed,” he murmured.

I raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?”

“Yeah.” He tilted his head. “What, were you hoping it was Bigfoot?”

I huffed out a laugh. “Just hoping it was something we could shoot.”

Trevor’s laugh was too loud, too forced. “Christ, you people are paranoid.”

I ignored him.

Eddie lingered by the window, eyes still flicking between the trees, fingers still tense against the glass.

But the music started up again, and the bottles clinked, and soon the air was buzzing once more with easy laughter and the warmth of cheap liquor and the glow of artificial light.


ALAN RUSSELL



The night had settled into something slow and hazy, its edges softened by alcohol and flickering candlelight, the low hum of conversation and music pulsing beneath the wooden beams of the cabin.

Downstairs, the party was still going, but the worst of it had passed—the reckless, feverish energy had given way to something lazier, sleepier, more indulgent, the kind of drunk that had people curling into corners, voices hushed, movements slow. The tension from earlier had faded into something quieter, something that could almost be mistaken for comfort.

But it wasn’t gone.

It had just buried itself beneath the noise.

I wasn’t drinking.

Not because I had any moral objection to it, but because I wanted to keep my head clear. Something still felt off, something I couldn’t quite name, and I wasn’t about to let myself sink into the same haze as the rest of them.

I envied them.

Not because they were having fun, but because they could pretend. Because they could drink themselves into a haze and let themselves believe, even for a night, that the world outside this cabin wasn’t rotting, that the things lurking in the dark weren’t real, that nothing was waiting for them beyond the tree line.

I couldn’t do that.

So I had excused myself, leaving behind the glow of the fire and the warmth of the party, making my way to my bathroom—attached to the massive room that was my bedroom, far enough away from the main floor that I could almost pretend I was alone up here, separate from the noise, the alcohol, the heavy scent of cigarette smoke wafting through the halls.

I dipped my hand into the warm holy water that filled the clawfoot tub, watching as steam curled lazily into the air, spreading through the dimly lit room like a breath. The scent of minerals hung in the air, clean and sharp.

Holy water.

I had boiled it first, let it settle, then cooled it down just enough to be tolerable.

A stupid idea, probably. 

But if it worked—if it did anything at all—then maybe I had finally found a way to fight back. Maybe I had found something that could keep the things in the dark away for good.

If I could climb into that water and come out whole, untouched, untouchable—then maybe I had found something real, something I could fight back with.

I took a deep breath, leaning against the sink.

There was a soft knock on the door.

I turned my head, eyes searching for the mysterious late-night visitor.

Heather was standing in the doorway, one hand resting against the frame, her hair slightly tousled, her cheeks flushed just a little too pink. She wasn’t drunk, not really, but she was loose, the sharp edges of her usual guarded expression softened, smoothed over by just enough alcohol to make her brave.

I straightened. “You okay?”

She didn’t speak right away, just nodded and stepped inside, closing the door behind her.

Suddenly the noise from the party felt very far away.

Heather sighed, leaning back against the counter, toying with the hem of her sweater. She stood in the doorway, one hand resting on the frame, her hair slightly windblown from the open windows downstairs.

I watched her for a moment. “You sure everything’s okay?”

She smirked. “You mean, besides my now very public breakup and the fact that Tricia is probably jumping my ex as we speak?”

I shrugged. “I wasn’t gonna say it.”

Her smirk faded into something quieter, something thoughtful.

“I never really loved him.”

The words were quiet, flat. Like she had just realized it herself. 

I searched her face.

“I know.”

She huffed out a small laugh, shaking her head. “Of course you do.”

A silence stretched between us. Not awkward. Not uncomfortable. Just there.

“I needed some air,” she murmured. “Too many people downstairs. Too many…” She trailed off, then smirked. “Too many Trevors.”

I huffed out a quiet laugh. “Yeah. I figured that breakup wouldn’t exactly ruin his night.”

Heather rolled her eyes, tilting her head back. “It’s honestly embarrassing how little I care. It’s like I was dating a houseplant.”

“A very persistent houseplant.”

She laughed, really laughed, and the sound settled warm and low in my chest, curling around something I had been trying to ignore for a long time.

She looked at me then, eyes flicking down to the tub, to the steam rising off the water. “You were about to take a bath?”

I rubbed the back of my neck sheepishly. “Seemed like a better use of my time than getting trashed with the rest of them.”

She smiled, small and knowing.

“I used to picture this, you know.”

I blinked. “What?”

She hesitated, like she hadn’t meant to say it, like the words had slipped out before she could stop them.

Then she sighed, shaking her head, laughing a little at herself.

“Us,” she admitted. “Being alone like this. Away from everything. Away from… everyone.” She glanced down at her hands. “I thought, if things had gone differently, maybe we would’ve—”

She cut herself off, didn’t finish the sentence.

I glanced up at her, mentally testing the waters.

“Me too.”

I reached up, brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. The words hung between us, heavy and real. And just like that—we were somewhere else. Not in this cabin, not in this moment, but in every moment before it.

All the nights we had spent talking in hushed voices, knees touching beneath library tables, hands brushing in the dark. Every time I had looked at her and thought, just once. Just for a second.

I had never let myself have it, had never let myself want it.

Until now.

She took a step towards me, slow, measured, like she was giving me time to stop her. 

I didn’t.

She stepped closer, just enough to close the space between us, just enough to feel the warmth radiating off her skin, just enough to see the way her breath hitched slightly, the way her lips parted like she was about to say something but forgot what it was.

Her fingers brushed mine, a whisper of warmth, a question without words. 

Then she grabbed my collar, pulled me down, and kissed me.

It wasn’t slow or hesitant. It was deep and real and aching, the kind of kiss that wasn’t a mistake, wasn’t an accident, wasn’t something that could be undone.

I melted into it, into her. Into the feeling of her hands gripping the front of my shirt, pulling me closer, pressing into me like she had been waiting just as long as I had. She tasted like warmth, like whiskey and something sweet, like the taste of waking from a refreshing slumber.

My hands slid to her waist, anchoring her, pulling her against me. And for the first time in years, I wasn’t thinking, wasn’t second-guessing.

I was just here with her.

Heather pulled back, just slightly, her breath warm against my lips, her fingers still curled into my shirt.

But her eyes—her eyes had flicked to the steaming tub behind me.

And when she looked back at me, there was something new in those pools of green, something I had never seen before. Something that sent a slow, spreading heat curling through my stomach, wrapping around my ribs, creeping up my spine.

I swallowed, my throat suddenly dry.

She smiled ferociously.
