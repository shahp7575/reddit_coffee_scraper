1nt76i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1nt76i0/day_5_post_op_i_went_back_to_working/,Day 5 - Post Op (I went back to working),"BUT the kind of work I have is not like I need to lift, push, or handle heavy and large objects. I'm a ""visual artist"". I make paintings, drawings, etc. I work from home and I'm self- employed. 

My husband is also self-employed and working from home and he's the one lifting heavy and large objects for me.

My stomach is less gassy, less hard, and less feeling heavy. My incisions look like they are healing.

I TRIED BLACK COFFEE TODAY and I'm okay! 

My incisions look like they are healing. And I have to keep in mind that even if I'm feeling 80% normal, I still can't abuse it. I still do my best to remember not to lift heavy objects. 

Also force is equivalent to mass so if you have to push or pull a large heavy object, it's the same as lifting, so don't do it. 

I can imagine that if you're alone and is recovering from surgery, it's difficult and I'm so sorry for that. Hugs to you.

If my husband is not around, maybe I can do some alternative into lifting heavy objects fot example: transferring water or rice in small portions. And if I can't think of any alternative, screw it. 

Nobody wants to have a hernia or any reasons to go back to the hospital. 

I just wanna shout out to the world that my husband is my rock - he's amazing and I'm so fortunate. 

Lastly, it's very important to rest. Sleep and rest help the body to repair and recover.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements (about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days, and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

• During plasmapheresis, blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do. Donor identification systems are in place to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by your overall diet over several days, not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited, it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as it can dehydrate you.

5. No strenuous exercise for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. Most centers recommend avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

7. If your pulse rate is above 100, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, the box breathing technique may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to heal and repair your veins via normal tissue healing.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait at least a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating to reduce bleeding and bruising risks.

• You can use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased immunoglobulin levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein nutrients found in plasma.

• Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess. Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, you must be healthy when you donate and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is highly encouraged for all donors.

1nt76bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nt76bw/is_it_time_for_my_20f_relationship_with_my_bf_20f/,Is it time for my [20F] relationship with my bf [20F] to end?,"Hi everyone! My apologies in advance if my post is lacking, this is my first reddit post. This is also my attempt at a “throw away account”, as I have a slight following on other platforms and really do not want people (followers or friends) to know that this is my post. Very long post incoming so: 

TLDR; After 2 years of dating, I feel as if my boyfriend has been regressing instead of maturing (with major life events like his proposal making it more obvious).

Let’s get right to it with the backstory: My boyfriend and I began dating during the second half of our last year of secondary school, officially becoming a couple the day after my 18th birthday. During our first date we were straightforward with one another about our life plans as major life changes were obviously coming our way. He was undecided on the specifics, but said he would join the military to which I said I’d be perfectly fine with (coming from a military family) so long as he didn’t expect me to uproot all my life plans and follow him anywhere and everywhere, to which he said he understood. I was already planning to move to a nearby college town with my close friend to complete my degree.  Relationship goes on, everything is absolutely perfect from the beginning. He had a somewhat dysfunctional family life, so my home becomes our hang-out spot and my family hosts him at most of our meals. Only argument we ever had was him accusing me of cheating because he went through my phone while I was sleeping and found a random message of some guy shirtless in an app I hadn’t used since long before our relationship began, who I had never conversed with and I had never even opened the message (so obviously not cheating). He leaves for bootcamp around 8/9 months into our relationship, we sent letters every week, called every chance we got, and made it through the two months without a doubt in our minds about our relationship. I coordinated the trip to attend his graduation on the other side of the country for his mother, myself and my mother (who fronted the cost of most of the trip as neither his mother nor I had the means to). Very stressful due to MIL being indecisive and prone to panic, but we made it, picked him up, visited some of extended family in the area, and brought him home for the holidays before he left to his first station; on the other side of the world. He put this location as #1 on his list of dream locations to be assigned, which I understood to some degree because I encouraged him to use his career to his advantage and travel, but we’re talking 6-hour time difference, 24 hour long air travel, thousands of miles apart literally on an island in the middle of the Pacific. He then proceeded to try and talk me out of moving into the place I had already signed a lease on while he was in boot camp, to move with him (I did not, I was firm on this). 

We had already discussed marriage because both of us dating with that intention, but we had our second ever argument came while ring shopping over the holidays because I told him exactly what I wanted. He said he didn’t want to “just buy me another thing”, and wanted to be involved in the decision. Over the coming months, he moved to his station and I made an in-depth slideshow of basically exactly what I wanted while clarifying where he had creative liberties and all the details and information he needed to not be taken advantage of by a jeweler (I wanted to pursue jewelry design at the time so this was all very specific and clearly important to me but I understood he wanted to be involved so I tried to make it possible with him having hardly any knowledge on the subject). As far as the proposal went I just asked that he put some legitimate effort into it (a.k.a just make it feel like a special private moment) and make sure it was photographed as my mother’s biggest regret around her proposal, wedding and other life events was not having any photos. A go pro would’ve been just fine, but I sent the social media accounts professional photographers I liked anyway in case he decided to go that route. Issues were slowly arising during these months, nothing totally detrimental though. I visited him at his station for the first time this past spring (5-6 months after he’d moved there) and we’d been talking about getting engaged so much that I explicitly stated, repeatedly, that “Hey btw if it doesn’t happen during this trip that’s totally fine, I’d rather it take forever to happen than have you rush it.” I visited for two weeks. The issues were glaring now. We hardly left the apartment, he left me at the apartment without food or a key to access the amenities 3/4 of the time I was there, expected me to make any and all plans, openly said we could just “play house” the whole time because I’d “obviously get to come back”, and we argued over intimacy repeatedly. I have PCOS and Endometriosis causing me to be unable to enjoy those things, and apparently they were incredibly important to him. Sparing you the nitty gritty, we engaged in activities that caused me harm because I thought I was being a poor partner by essentially depriving him of something that he couldn’t seem to live without, not knowing at the time that my conditions had brought on pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. By the end of the two weeks I could not wait to get home, but he begged me to extend my trip by a few more days as he’d finally made plans for us. I caved and extended the trip by a few days, and guess what happened? Proposal. This part of the story is already incredibly long so I’ll skip the details and maybe share in the comments but it was decent, although obviously rushed. I said “Yeah?” in the moment because I was truly at a loss of words, we took a slew of photos with a photographer, went to breakfast at a coffee shop (neither of us drink coffee and it’s the one smell in the world that gives me an automatic migraine). I knew in my gut I couldn’t leave this island engaged the following morning so I asked to go home for a nap, but he laid down right next to me to sleep as well so I got up and went to sit outside. I was in a precarious situation as I honestly did not know how he’d react to the news and if I would be safe being in his home so far from mine. Called my mom and best friend, explained the situation, sobbed, and shared locations. Broke the news, he threw a bit of a fit in my opinion but things were okay enough that we went to a dinner show later that night and he took me to the airport the next day. During that ride he asked what I planned to do when we were engaged (ex. “just put the ring on and finally tell everyone because obviously I’m not supposed to propose again?”). He didn’t text or call me until basically a day after I got home, and hardly spoke to me after that because his feelings were hurt. 

This is where the issue of regression became clear to me. I’m an eldest daughter and have always been the “independent, mature, wise for your age, problem-solver” and although he has many siblings he was basically raised as an only child due to age gaps so I imagine this could contribute to how our relationship dynamic has ended up here. Between the lack of planning on his end for the whole trip, the way he’d been speaking so crudely to me for months up until now, asking me to plan how we get engaged in the future, asking me to figure out what we do with the ring now, and the following months of him complaining on the phone to me about how expensive door-dashing me half dead flowers once a month (without my asking or pressuring) was on him, to how I wasn’t calling him enough despite the fact that he wasn’t initiating any calls, to how our relationship was boring because I wasn’t pursuing anything sexually (he was flat out ignoring the fact that I’d begun medically induced menopause to function daily), and wasn’t complimenting him enough. We’ve had several conversations about how I had continued all this post-proposal while he turned into a brick wall, and have only recently stopped because I won’t keep watering dead plants if he won’t at least try to reciprocate. I was also on a family trip at the time, giving me less time to maintain the relationship for both of us. I’ve repeatedly asked for more maturity and initiative on his end of things, especially because I feel myself growing as an individual and am ready to make some big life decisions that I either need to incorporate him into or plan without him. Since all this, I have moved out and he has visited before leaving for another state to attend schooling. We saw each other for all of 48 hours, he stayed the night at my place with no housewarming gift/gesture, we missed our “date” he’d finally planned the following morning because he wanted to do intimate activities despite me literally being in physical therapy for my pelvic floor being so screwed, then took a nap and made me late to my physical therapy appointment that very day. We visited my parents and spent the night there, where he wanted to be intimate again the next morning which I stopped quickly. He left that afternoon and since getting to school we’ve maybe called twice in the month he’s been there which is apparently my fault although he doesn’t have access to his cellphone half the day every week day and spends the entire time he does have it on weekends out with friends, not to mention we hardly text because he won’t speak about anything other than small talk with me. 

Ultimately I need help deciding if breaking things off now would be rash because I told him nearly a year ago that I wanted him to aid in my recovery after my laparoscopy (endometriosis surgery) which is now happening over the holiday season and he found a loophole in his employment to make that happen and plans to be here. The problem is my surgeon has already told me this procedure will probably be intense (laparoscopic procedure consisting of ablation of excess tissue [likely grown up into my chest cavity and on sciatic nerve], hysteroscopy, hernioplasty, possible egg retrieval), and the last thing I want is to have to “teach” him how to care for me like I’ve had to “teach” him how to cook or clean things he’s always been able to do himself while in pain and incapable of normal function. My best friend advises me to wait things out a while (mainly because she’s heard me say I’m afraid of making a rash decision and regretting it), while my parents and other close friends say it’s probably just time to walk away. I think I need someone else to just flat out tell me what needs to be done because I’m putting it off due to not wanting to deal with the emotions (I’m a full time student on that mf grind so I quite literally do not have time for distractions [aka emotional rollercoasters]). If you read this all the way through or just skimmed thank you either way and I’m very grateful for any opinions shared. Thanks guys! :)",1,1759114679.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I have hypomagnesemia and vitamin D deficiency. Otherwise, I feel fine. I don't know how. Episodes like these, where food itself takes away my hunger, are recurrent and annoying when you're on pills. It's good to have something thick that I can drink. Yogurt, for example, is easier to eat than something solid.

They say vitamin D deficiency could be a cause or aggravation of my depression. I don't know. Now I'm drinking sugar-free hot chocolate.

I’ll be in town with friends for a long weekend and we’re looking for the top restaurant recommendations for New Hope and Lambertville. I hadn’t seen a recent post on this so thought I’d ask. Any suggestions are appreciated but we’re specifically looking for:

Coffee, Breakfast/Brunch, upscale dinner, casual dinner, cocktail/wine bars/breweries, casual bites and quick pickups. Also anything that’s infant-friendly is a plus.

Thanks in advance 😊

So when they set an opening date I told my 14yo we could go the summer before he started high school. A summer vacation/middle school graduation combo, if you will.

We went late August.  Even coming from the northeast, we are well versed in the heat and expected afternoon rains of Florida.  No biggie - as expected.  All good. 

We read the reddits, watched the youtubes, checked the maps and menus.  We made our own ""must do"" and ""skippable"" lists.

Overall - we had a great day!  We did everything we wanted to do.  If we didn't do our homework, and ALSO remain flexible, our day could have gone much differently.

We took a rideshare in and arrived about 40 minutes before ""official"" opening.  We headed straight for BATM because we read it might open early and to avoid potential breakdown delays later in the day.  This strategy worked. It opened early and we walked in with little wait (almost toooo little wait because the queue was amazing visually but we had to keep moving). We were out and enjoyed our first ""must do"" crepe treat plus an extra cup of coffee for mom - by 10:10 am.  

We skipped over to Dark Universe and did the roller coast and indoor ride with little wait.  Decided to come back and re-do both again after dark.  Black toilets are disconcerting.  Monsters Unchained is SO underrated I don't get it.

Stopped at Stardust Racers on our way to Berks.  45-ish wait? Not sure what was happening - only one track running and we were the last group allowed through before it delayed completely again. Maybe weather but I don't think so.  Awesome ride but for us a ""once a day/trip"" ride.  It was great but not something we could ride back to back just too much g-force action.  It was amazing though.

Off to Berks. we wanted to see the Untrainable Dragon show, do Wing Gliders, didn't care about Dragon Racer's Rally and only interested in Fyre Drill if we needed something to cool off.  Our timing was good for the next Untrainable Dragon show  which was cute... but Toothless was ""away"", which wasn't clearly explained up front and led to an extended overly-dramatic dry ice fog to mask Hiccup's entry that was both annoying and anti-climatic.  Also glad we went, especially since it was the last show of the day. Not sure what happened but the remaining show times ended up cancelled.

After the show, we headed to Wing Gliders which had a reasonable wait but questionable weather on the way.  We got almost to the lockers before lightening shut it down. We elected to stay in line since we were under cover and the sky OPENED as they do in Florida in the summer.  Overall hung about an hour for the rain to pass before ditching for a snack.  Glad we stayed put  - outside the ride queue it was clear people were jammed in bathrooms and limited food service seating during the worst of the downpours.  We grabbed a couple of mac and cheese cones for a snack.  Spoiler alert it's just mac and cheese (and/or pork) layered in a hollowed out cone shaped bun with everything bagel seasoning on the outside.  It was good, but not getting the hype.

Off we crossed to Nintendo. Passing through the portal was very cool. Once we got to the top of the escalator, it was a different story.  The immersion was amazing, but the sensory overload was pure hell.  I respect why some people and children enjoy it but it was pulling Simpson's Krusty the Klown way more than Hey it'samee Mario.  Just wow.  We wandered a bit, glad we didn't buy the bands to play the mini games (because it was just that chaotically overstimulating) and headed to Donkey Kong.  It was a long wait but we hadn't waited much yet and it was marked as ""closing early"", so we decided to suck it up and get in line.  It was 75 minutes when we got in line, but was closer to 120.  Around 90 minutes we started getting threatened with weather related closure, then non-weather related delay and finally we got on.  It wasn't worth it.

Because so many rides close during rain, by the time we got out Mario Kart had cleared out and was basically a ""walk on"" @ 20 ish minutes.  It was OK.  Staff were disengaged and not helpful.  Gameplay explanation was left to video pictograms with no dialogue.  I am the worlds worst Mario Kart player and I won for our vehicle.  Son unimpressed.

We didn't care to wait for Yoshi for any more than 15 minutes (it was 60) and our brains hurt, so we headed out.

My son convinced me to try and make another run at Hiccup's despite rain threatening on the way.  I wanted to find someplace under cover for food before we got stranded in a bathroom for the next storm.   We bartered, he won.  We managed to eek out one run on Wing Gliders before it shut down for storming.  Great ride.  He was right.

As soon as we got off we BOOKED it for Pizza Moon to have a rest.  We no sooner sat down when the sky OPENED again and people flooded in and they went to wait line for tables.  Witnessed some really special and obnoxious entitled human behavior trying to sit without eating.  Enjoyed some pizza and a glass of wine and my kiddo indulged me after riding the carousel.

After THAT we headed back to Dark Universe to ride the coaster and Monsters Unchained after dark which was AWESOME.  These are totally under rated rides.

Neither of us were up to Stardust Racers again but we did squeak into queue for one more ride on Wing Gliders before park closing.

Overall - we had an AWESOME day!  We went on a Sunday, no Express Passes or Early Entry.  We did our research ahead and decided what was important and what wasn't.  I love all my family but I really love going to theme parks with only two people. It makes switching gears so much easier and even more so with older kids.

All that said.  We had a great day but as others have noted, so many rides are taken down by weather and there aren't enough other ""things"" to balance the load. I owe another adult kid a FL trip but at this point I think we're going to let this one marinate until it finds it's groove and identity. Long lines does not make it a ""full day"" park.... it seems to want to cater to everyone, but doesn't have enough to cater to any one demographic a full day experience at the same time if that makes sense.   We spent a lot of time doubling back and forth and even snack carts were difficult to find.  I desperately wanted something sweet after dinner but it was either too far away or not available.  Even popcorn.  So strange.  

We enjoyed... just not in a hurry to head back for a bit.  Cheers!

Disclaimer – About Trypophobia:  
If you suffer from this phobia, please avoid viewing the next pictures.

Hi everyone!

Recently, while washing my espresso filter baskets from MHW-3BOMBER, something funny happened... I have one BEP basket (15g) and two DEX baskets (18g and 20g).

Dialing in between those filters has always been a bit of a challenge. With the 20g basket, extraction is consistently good and well-balanced.

Using the 15g basket, I need to grind considerably finer to maintain the same ratio (as expected)... But the shot runs incredibly fast.

The 18g basket should be somewhere in the middle, but it's ALWAYS very confusing. I couldn't establish a clear correlation between the amount of coffee and grind size compared to the others.

During the cleaning process, I poured water directly into the 20g and 18g DEX baskets. To my surprise, the flow was slower in the 20g basket. I know the internal size is different, but it was really slower—like 3 to 4 times slower than the 18g.

The 15g BEP basket is faster than both. In fact, it's 2 to 3 times faster than the 18g.

Tasting notes:

- 15g – Mostly acidic. The extraction starts slow but speeds up dramatically after a few seconds. With grind adjustments, I can get good extractions between 20–40 seconds.
- 18g – Typically inconsistent. Some shots are great, others not so much... Consistency is the challenge.
- 20g – Always balanced. There's plenty of room to fine-tune the grind size.

So...  
Am I getting a little help from the flow restriction in the 20g basket?

OR...

Am I just a crazy coffee person trying to explain nonsense that isn’t even a thing—maybe it’s all about the coffee bed?

Funny enough, the holes in the 15g basket look smaller than in the others.

Ratios used: 1:2 ~ 1:3  
Time: 20 ~ 40s

Coffee types tested:
- Medium roast – Low acidity profile  
- Medium-dark roast  
- Dark roast

Lots of testing was done... Haha!

I'm trying to cut back on buying black coffees outside and finally set up something at home. Space is limited, so I first looked at in-built grinder espresso machines, but I keep reading they're high-maintenance and pricey. Now I'm wondering if a small grinder + AeroPress (or similar) is the smarter move for taste vs. cost and upkeep.

What I care about

I mostly drink black coffee (Americanos or drip-style). Milk drinks are rare.

Small footprint and easy maintenance are big priorities.

I'd like good flavor without a 20-minute ritual every morning.

Budget is flexib t I don't want to overspend if the taste gains are minor.

Options I'm considering

1. All-in-one espresso machine (with built-in grinder) - worried about long-term reliability/servicing.

Small grinder + AeroPress compact and cheap, but is the cup quality close to café drip/Americano?

2.

3. Hand grinder + pour-over (V60/ Kalita) or Moccamaster-style small brewer - more parts, but maybe better consistency?

4. Manual espresso + hand grinder (Flair/Robot) - smaller than a full machine, but is the workflow fussy for daily use?

Questions

For black-coffee drinkers, is espresso gear overkill vs. a good grinder + AeroPress/pour-over?

If you've owned Il-in-one, how was maintenance (c ng the grinder nath descaling renairs)?

Any compact grinder recs that punch above their weight for filter (and maybe espresso later)?

If you went AeroPress or pour-over, what's your simple daily workflow (kettle, grind setting, recipe) that still tastes great?

Pls any options, thanks in advance 🙏 ",1,1759114143.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

* **Private Markets**: Linqto investors thought they owned Ripple or Circle through SPVs. Turns out, the SPVs weren’t even properly formalized. When bankruptcy hit, everyone discovered they were just unsecured creditors.

Different industries. Different headlines. Same flaw: capital structures built to protect insiders while shifting the risk down the chain.

Lately I've been introspecting and thinking about the relationships in my life, with family, friends and my girlfriend. All of this thinking has led to me concluding that I'm pushing everyone away and pretty much imploding. 

I find it very difficult to express my thoughts in words. I've been in the States for a few months (2-3) and it's been very lonely. People at my place of work aren't there most sociable and besides work and the daily afternoon coffee run, we hardly talk about anything else. 

Coming to family and friends, I wasn't successful in making close friends in college.  I did finally become a part of a group but then college ended. Everyone's busy with their internships in the same city, it feels sad to see them have fun while I'm here in another country all alone. It's the same with family, I haven't been to any major family events in about 4-5 years now, since I started college away from home. 

My girlfriend is usually my corner stone, we've been dating for a few years now. It's a LDR but we plan to live together next year. The thing is, we've been having major fights lately and broke ups few months ago, a combination of things and me going to another country was a part of it. We do talk now, but the 9 hour time difference makes things really really difficult. 

I can see my relationships ending and I feel helpless to change that. 

I have a few predictions for myself for the upcoming 3 months:
- me and my girlfriend break up forever
- I burn away whatever money I have on weed (already at 150 dollars a month)
- I fall back into the dark place I crawled out of last year

Idk what I'm doing. I feel extremely clueless. If everything goes the way it's going right now, I'll end up with no job, no PhD accepts and no friends. 

Fun thing is, I'm pretty good at what I do. And I've seen people with no skill get into places I've been rejected from (I don't wanna hear skill issue). 

Ahhh idk what I'm doing. I lie in bed all day after and before work. I smoke up pretty much everyday and have started smoking cigarettes too (didn't know you could throw up if you smoke too much). 

I know a simple solution would be to join groups on meetup or something, and yes I normally would. I've made Reddit posts looking for friends, I've even gotten replies. But I end up ghosting then after a few days or it just trails off. I've noticed I'm boring, and it's possible I'm antisocial or having been feeling that way for a bit now. 

I'm usually not like this, but I'm seeing myself go down a path that I know won't end well for me and idk what to do to stop it. And I guess that helplessly watching all this is frustrating and taking a toll on my well being. 

P.S. 
No idea what I'm tryna achieve with this post or with my life in general. 

Also, I've noticed that I tend to victimize myself sometimes, maybe this is that, who knows. Worst case I just added to the millions of random Reddit posts. ",0,1759113257.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False

This post is long and somewhat a rant but also it’s me asking for advice how to address the lack of initiative my au pair has been showing so far. 

She gets along so well with him and they play happily so that’s great, and she’s generally a cheerful optimistic person. I’ve done tremendous work on her house-etiquette already but we have ways to go in that department. 

I’m generally pleased with her because I know when I leave the house, my child will read books with her, play, eat well most of the time and take naps well so it’s a win. A lot of things are far away from perfect but I still discount it since she’s been with us for only 2.5 months. She’s learning some house skills and childcare skills as she goes and as I train her to do better, but some things I’m afraid I don’t know how to train.

For example, when she first started I had to tell her what to do every 5 minutes which actually defends the purpose of getting childcare help if I have to be present constantly to ensure everything is going well. Like I had to tell her “AP, time to change his diaper.” She goes and takes it off. Then I have to mention “oh yeah you have to clean him before you put a new diaper on.”. She proceeds. Then “ok now dispose and used diaper. Yeah, it goes in diaper genie. Well done!”. I understand there’s a learning curve but it should be intuitive that once you change a baby, you threw away used diaper, right? 

Then I had to explain that I’m not her maid and she needs to clean her dishes and put them in dish washer. Then also put clean dishes back up. One step at a time…

She mopped the floors in her area and then I had to tell her she also has to dispose the water and clean the rag after use. Super intuitive things that are such common sense to me. I no longer think there are any “crazy house rules” because I wouldn’t think of outlining simple routines like that, but in my case it makes sense unfortunately. I sent her all those instructions in writing to minimize language barrier issue as well.

If in the morning I hand my son to her and he only has his diaper on, when I get him from her a few hours later, he often isn’t dressed. Unless I specifically tell her to dress him, she won’t budge. Also she feeds him and leaves bottles around the house when it was outlined she’s responsible for washing them and at least putting them in dish washer, no need to wait until no clean bottle is available. 

Then house etiquette. If I cook a nice 2-3 course dinner, and maybe even bake some dessert, it’s customary for another person to offer to do the dishes. She doesn’t. For the first 2 weeks she never cooked for herself and only ate when I cooked, then also ate the leftovers I put in the fridge so I was forced to cook daily, and I didn’t have to before she arrived. I’ve noticed if I didn’t cook she’d just eat sandwiches that aren’t even toasted and had most random ingredients so I felt bad for her for obviously not knowing how to even fry an egg (lied about being self sufficient in interview). Then she played with my son and he threw tens of toys out of his pen, she’d just walk away and sit and chill in the same room with us when it was her time off but she wouldn’t have an initiative to tidy up the space. It’s much better now, but when I made gentle remarks at first it didn’t help. I had to tell her 3-5 times a day to pick up toys and put things up or I’d spend time doing it instead of having quality time with my family instead. I literally had to tell her very straightforward that I did not welcome another person (that I also pay) in my home and family just to cook and clean 3x more than I did before and have less time to rest or spend with my son. She drastically improved after that but needs at least a bi-weekly written reminder of morning and evening routines and the fact that it’s her responsibility to tidy up play areas. 

My irritation with that peaked when we returned from a 10 day luxury beach vacation with her (where she had 4.5 days off to do whatever she wanted and the whole trip was 100% paid by me and she of course had her private bedroom and bathroom) and she didn’t even think of helping unpacking baby’s things! Also did not volunteer to hold the baby once for whole duration of a travel but helped herself to food that I was paying for 3 times on the way to the destination, when even I only ordered and ate once. When I asked her how she enjoyed the trip, she said it was hard, and getting there was hard (3 hours flight where she wasn’t responsible for my son at all and was just sitting with her headphones on.), and she’s just glad we are finally going back. It was literally her second time taking a flight in her life so I tried not to judge that too hard. The evening of our return she knocked on my door right at his bedtime asking to clean my cats vomit from her room. (Cat was left at the house and we had cat sitter see him every other day and apparently he threw up on AP’s bedroom wood floor while we were gone). I told her I’ll clean in the morning, I have a crying boy in my arms. In the morning she walked up to me reminding me about the clean up. For reference, she has a whole 3rd floor to herself (private bedroom, closet, bathroom, balcony and coffee station and small living room space) so I never pass by her territory, we stay downstairs. I know my cat isn’t her responsibility, but accidents do happen and she’s a member of this household. If it’s in her personal territory it’s fair and normal to clean it up yourself, especially since we have adequate cleaning supplies and gloves available. She didn’t clean it and came running to me in the morning saying it’s still there letting it soak into the floor more than it would have taken nothing but a minute to clean earlier and she wouldn’t have to sleep in a room with it ugh 😩 

We also have quite an annoying food-related issue going on but I don’t want to make 100th “my au pair eats all our food” post on here, and I’m currently trying another strategy to try to fix that. Hopefully I won’t come buck to this sub discussing our version of never ending food situation issues in this program. 

How to tackle lack of initiative and not following routines issue? Some times it gets on my nerves so bad I browse other au pairs on the agency web site and read horror stories on this Reddit. But I believe she’s a decent persona and my son likes her so I’d rather work on it. Just “having a discussion” doesn’t seem to work. 

I’m a little worried I made it very specific and she might be on Reddit in this sub too. Well, if you are - then you know what you need to work on to help improve life for all of us. ",1,1759113245.0,Aupairs,8,0.6,False

Hiya! I’m a fifteen year old writer who has just made her first story! If any of you guys would like to share any advice or tips on the plot, characters, behaviors, etc, please let me know!

DISCLAIMER: this is JUST a rough draft, nothing is set in stone (i am just a girl lol)

In 1994, Katie Walters, the “mean girl” and the epitome of high-school perfection; popular, beautiful, dating the star football player, Trent Harrison, and living a seemingly idyllic life, but it still isn’t enough for her parents, is secretly dating a girl, specifically, her best friend and soccer teammate, Scarlett “Scottie” Parker, whom she is obsessed with. But then, the two get attacked by the football boys, including Trent, while they are drunk and leaving a party, and they attack Scottie to a pulp while Katie runs away; that same night, Katie’s conservative parents let Katie know that her grandmother is in the hospital, and that they are visiting her right now; when Katie arrives at the hospital and sees a doctor tending to a battered Scottie, she asks the doctor if she is going to be okay; that’s when she breaks the news; Scottie is in a coma. In 2021, Katie is now married to Trent, and they have one daughter, who they named Scarlett, who is 16 going on 30, after Scottie. Scottie finally wakes up; and the first thing she does is ask if Katie ran away from the football boys, and immediately digs into Katie’s new life. Scottie arrives while Trent and Scarlett are out of town for a father-daughter trip, asking if she could stay, just for a couple weeks. Katie says yes. Katie tells Scottie about Scarlett, the high school drama that happened while Scottie was out, Katie telling Scottie that she got pregnant with Scarlett right after they graduated, so her and Trent had to get married immediately after, in a courthouse, they argue, and Katie and Scottie finally kiss. Scarlett comes home, and sees them kiss. The next day, it’s Katie’s birthday. Scottie gives Katie a birthday cake, and she says that Scarlett and Trent are at a coffee shop. Katie also says that her and Scarlett will be going homecoming dress shopping, and says that Trent will just stay at the house, if Scottie is okay with that. Scarlett snitches on Scottie and Katie to Trent while they are out on a coffee date. While Katie and Scarlett go dress shopping for Scarlett homecoming, Trent and Scottie get in a fight, resulting in Trent stabbing Scottie. Trent then rushes out of the house, leaving Scottie on the kitchen floor to die. When Katie and Scarlett arrive, the house is a mess. Katie finds Scottie’s bloody body in the kitchen, begging her to wake up, saying that she always loved her. Scottie then dies in Katie’s arms. Scarlett then starts crying, telling Katie that she didn’t know that her dad would kill Scottie. Katie then lashes out at Scarlett.

I was surprised how bitter my first few pots came out. I increased the grind size to reduce bitterness until I ended up near my max setting (Capresso 560) and things started tasting watery - but still bitter.

  
I'm using the same coffee as my french press, so I'm familiar with the coffee I'm using.

  
I did measure the water temperature coming out of the spout using my mini thermometer. It measured right at 208-210 F, and for comparison measured 212-213 F in boiling water. This seems higher than what people are saying it should be - 195-205. And I've heard that too high a temp causes bitterness.

1nt6hrz,https://i.redd.it/troeilysk0sf1.png,Preparing for Digital ID & Banking Freezes (UK • Canada • Australia • USA),"With governments around the world exploring digital ID systems, some worry about potential financial restrictions tied to them. Regardless of where you live, being prepared ensures resilience. Here’s a quick guide:

---

🔑 Financial Prep

- Keep multiple bank accounts (include credit unions & local institutions).
- Store emergency cash at home in small denominations.
- Prepaid debit cards & money orders as backups.
- Prepay essentials like utilities, transport passes, and mobile data.
- Keep passports, driver’s licences, and physical ID documents up to date.

---

🏠 Household Readiness

- Stock non-perishable food (rice, pasta, canned goods).
- Keep bottled water & purification tablets.
- First aid kits, prescriptions, painkillers.
- Backup heating & lighting: blankets, candles, torches, batteries.

---

🔄 Barter System Readiness

- Everyday: Tea, coffee, sugar, soap, toilet rolls, plasters, matches.
- Medium Value: Spirits, chocolate, cooking oil, nappies, batteries, gas canisters.
- High Value: Tobacco, spices, seeds, blankets, solar chargers, first aid supplies.
- Skills as Currency: Cooking, sewing, DIY, gardening, tech repair, first aid.

---

👥 Community & Legal Prep

- Build trust with neighbours and local networks now.
- Identify shops & providers still accepting cash.
- Follow civil-liberties groups and official privacy commissioners.
- Keep written records if pressured into digital ID adoption.

---

⚖️ Tip: Stock more everyday essentials than you need — they’ll be your most valuable trade items.

👉 Share this to raise awareness. Preparedness is peace of mind.

Hello smart people! I could use some help making improvements to this floor plan. Mainly the first floor, but feel free to include any ideas for the second floor as well. 

Second image is the mockup of what I was thinking so far:

* Removing the **sauna** & **sitting** rooms and the portion of the **garage** below them (**garage** will now be 2.5 car - I don't really care that's more than enough for me)
* Turning **play room** into a **guest bedroom**
* Adding a shower to the **bathroom** across the hall for the **guest bedroom**
* Removing the **hall closet** to make a bigger **pantry** and to create a small niche for shelving or shallow cabinets in the the **bathroom**
* Extending covered **back patio** about 5ft
* Removing entry **coat closet** from under stairs because there will be a **basement**, carving out a niche in **garage** for a new **coat closet**, also flipped the **basement** stair door to open in to keep entryway more clear of doors opening and closing
* Reworked **garage** entry for the **mudroom**, took a portion of the **mudroom** to extend the **kitchen** (will use this area for coffee maker, toaster, other small appliances, charging stuff, etc.)
* Moved sink and dishwasher from **kitchen** island (prefer a clean island surface) to wall cabinets (unfortunately no window option but thought that adding some nice open shelving with strong lights above it will make it look okay? Example: [https://cdn.decorpad.com/photos/2016/12/01/gold-and-black-swing-arm-sconce-gray-kitchen-shelf.jpg](https://cdn.decorpad.com/photos/2016/12/01/gold-and-black-swing-arm-sconce-gray-kitchen-shelf.jpg))
* In the **kitchen** added an additional oven + microwave combo next to the fridge

I should probably add a door to the outside from either the mudroom or garage.

I'm not 100% on kitchen appliance placement so feel free to shoot me suggestions for that. Kitchen clearance between cabinets and island is 4ft, I would be open to 4.5ft because we throw parties often (big family) and everyone always ends up around the island. Which reminds me, the island is 9x5ft. I was going to make it 10ft long so either 10x5ft or 10x4ft since there is space. I am assuming slabs may be harder to come by for 10x5ft and that might be overkill anyhow but i'm fine with either option.

Further, something that just came to mind, I don't technically need the den. I could add the coat closet there and a half bath. That means I wouldn't need to niche into the garage for the coat closet and the full bathroom across the hall from the guest bedroom could then be an ensuite. I'll have to think over if I really need the den as an office or if I should just use one of the other bedrooms upstairs.

1nt6am7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1nt6am7/life_pro_tip_the_24hour_rule_saved_me_from_6700/,"Life Pro Tip: The ""24-Hour Rule"" saved me from $6,700 in impulse purchases last year","I've always been terrible with impulse buying, especially online. Last January, I decided to implement a simple rule: I must wait 24 hours before purchasing anything non-essential over $30.

How it works:

* Find something I want? Add to cart
* Close the tab/app immediately
* Set a calendar reminder for 24 hours later
* When the reminder pops up, ask: ""Do I still want this as much as yesterday?""

I tracked every ""cart abandonment"" for a year. Results:

* Total items abandoned: 83
* Items I still purchased after waiting: 19
* Items forgotten completely: 64
* Money saved: $6,732

What surprised me most was how many things I completely forgot about by the next day. Those trendy kitchen gadgets, tech accessories, and ""limited time"" sales all seemed so essential in the moment.

For the 19 items I did end up buying after waiting, I had time to research alternatives, find better prices, or wait for actual sales. The ""I need this now!"" urgency was gone, replaced by more rational decision-making.

The biggest savings came from avoiding a $1,200 ultrawide monitor (realized my desk couldn't even fit it) and an $800 espresso machine (did the math and realized it would take 3+ years of daily use to break even versus my local coffee shop's $2 special).

This simple mental trick has become my most effective frugal habit. No complex budgeting required, just a 24 hour cooling off period.

Started to recover, met my girlfriend, moved out at 18, had a good job, bought a nice car, I was feeling 7/10 again! Then she cheated on me, the next day I had a panic attack and nothing has felt the same since.On the way home that day before I had the panic attack, I started feeling super unreal and not recognizing the stuff around me, this makes me really scared that I went crazy, but once I got into town and my house I atleast recognized stuff again. Anyway, I stayed with her since she was my first gf like an idiot, and it led to a lot of stress because she wasn’t a good fit at all. We broke up with her at the beginning of this week and I feel better emotionally, but I still feel hollow, and I can’t seem to travel without freaking tf out. I’ll travel to places I’ve never been and get scared that I don’t recognize them, or that I’m gonna go crazy. After the panic attack I developed schizophrenia ocd, relationship ocd and generally sometimes I worry what if I’m hallucinating everything, what if I experience something bad and I go crazy etc.
It gets worse when I eat certain foods, stressed out, come across crazy people, stuff like that. The existential thoughts are anytime I’m not occupied, so I stay busy. 

Is there anyway out? I’ve been pushing myself to travel, and accepting these terrible feelings, and to be fair I haven’t had another panic attack, but I still feel empty. The only thing I can truly focus on is car racing because I’m good at it, but overall I’m so fricken forgetful and out of it. It’s affecting my ability to lock in and excel at work, or travel for racing opportunities .

The side effects: just like for a lot of people out there, coffee makes me pee a lot, makes me pooo in a ""different"" way, with more urgency and I feel like my colon gets irritated. Additionally, I've noticed that if I drink it on an empty stomach, I'd get acid reflux. Makes me anxious or jittery.

Depression and alcohol:
I've also noticed that coffee has been there on my worse days with alcohol. 

I've been recently diagnosed with dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder) and my therapists have recommended to quit alcohol or at least reduce it to a minimum. Alcohol being a depressant and then coffee randomly giving a mood crash... Bad combo.

I didn't know until recently that coffee can make you feel sad, since you could get a crash after that energy ""spike"". Apparently there's some research on the topic.

I don't feel that I need it:
I feel like I'm capable of quitting it and I don't need it, I do feel more tired but I just manage using other ways of waking up like cold water (or a cold shower in the morning).

Progress: 
27 days, no withdrawal symptoms. I was never a heavy coffee drinker, max two cups in one day but normally just one and I could always go for a few days without it.

I'm not planning to remove it completely from my life. I might have a cup when I know I will go clubing or similar.

Father is working a night shift so it was up to Mother and I to walk Cooper. The autumn chill has arrived. My inner ears hurt. Still, at least you only feel it when it gets dark. In the day, it was nice and warm; warm enough for me to wear capri shorts at least. I spent all day outside with little else to focus on other than my writing.

I wrote 718 words for I'm Still Sisyphus in the way I foreshadowed last night. I wrote bits of each section as they came to me once it became unbearable to focus on one section. The only downside is that I didn't finish most of the sections I wrote for but at the same time, I got all the pieces on the page to put together when I have the energy again. I am hoping to have these section done soon.

Anyway, my ears don't hurt quite as much anymore. I am going to make myself a coffee to warm the rest of me up. Father isn't going to back until morning so I'll also have to keep an eye on Cooper for him. I'm not sure if I want to write more tonight or relax. I have a new idea for a children's book series about fairies fighting off invasive species that I have been wrestling with. I like the concept but I am struggling with the subtext. A story about creatures fighting against foreign invaders is supposed to have a strong environmental theme but it can just as easily have anti-immigrant / xenophobic subtext that I'd have to work very delicately to avoid. I'm going to have to think on it a little longer because I even try to write a prompt. Maybe I'll wrestle with that tonight over my evening coffee.

Looking to solve a real problem that I've experienced with my partner.  
We've had many arguments about chores and how my partner feels overwhelmed.

Usually it goes something like:

Partner: ""I wish you would just do \_\_\_\_ without having to be asked""

Me: ""Just give me a list of things and I can do them all for you!!""

Partner: ""But this is our house and we live here together. You should see it and then do it without having to be asked""

Me: ""Yeah, but when I do it, I do it wrong and I don't know""

etc etc

One of the most impactful things for me was when we decided to assign responsibilities and define our goal for each - so for the dishes, that is my responsibility and our goal is to have no dishes in the sink before we go to bed.

Now my partner no longer has to worry about the dishes!

So I built an app to try and help other couples do the same. Looking for our first 100 users on testflight to help make it as good as possible :)

I had a strange experience today at Lafayette Park and wanted to sanity-check that I wasn’t out of line.

I usually walk there in the evenings with my wife, but today I went alone. There was a new coffee truck parked at the top of the hill, and the owners were super friendly — I grabbed a latte and had a nice little chat.

I walked over toward the edge of the park to take some photos of my coffee with the sunset in the background (nothing artsy, just vibes). Out of nowhere, a man — possibly unhoused — came up and started yelling at me that I didn’t have his consent to take photos, that it was illegal to record people, etc.

I was totally caught off guard but showed him my photos, which were literally just my cup and the sky — zero people in frame. He mumbled something about thinking I was filming, then started shouting again, “Don’t you dare record anyone without their consent!”

At that point I turned my back and started walking away, and he yelled after me, “Does anyone know this guy? He’s recording people without their consent!” I turned and said, “Dude, I’m just taking a photo of my coffee,” and kept walking.

A nice kid on a scooter noticed I was rattled and chatted with me for a minute to lighten the mood, which I appreciated.

I've been in Bangalore for the better part of a decade now and life has been pretty interesting. I've met a lot of fascinating people, both online and offline. My work is pretty interesting, so thats something I'm grateful for.  I was in a pretty great relationship that lasted quite a bit.  All in all, life has been pretty great.

A few years ago, I was someone who's daily routine was just my work and my apartment where I'd just sit on computer/whatever gaming console I had at the time, watch a whole lot of content,  a few phonecalls to my school buddies once in a while, and a series of very dumb and sometimes serious conversations with myself.  I was someone who decided to just remain single for the rest of my life.  I had become so used to it, and I used to really like spending time with myself.

But life had other plans, and I met someone and things just happend, and we broke up. I was prepared to go back to being single and I assumed it would be just like riding a cycle, and I could  go back to my old ways. But over the last four years, a lot has changed, as it inevitably would.  People would move on with their lives, and phonecalls and meetups with friends are few and far inbetween.  I mean, I don't know why I'm surprised, its only natural. So life is lonliner than it used to be. But it is what it is.

But besides the loneliness, I realized how much I actually missed that connection  I had in the realtionship.  I know it's obvious to most people, but I guess I was dumb for thinking I could get over it.

So, I'm looking for someone to chat with throughout the day. We can talk about anything from the existential dread of a Monday morning to the best places to find good biryani in this city. To  talk about mindless scrolling, a sounding board for bad jokes, and maybe, just maybe, someone to meet up with for a coffee or a beer.  
If it grows into something meaningful and long term, that would be amazing.

A little about me: I'm 33, work in research and also on a startup (I know, shocking), and have a slightly unhealthy obsession with sci-fi movies and shows. I'm also a pretty decent cook and can whip up a mean biriyani/pasta.

# If you're also looking for someone to just chat with, or if you're just looking for someone to break the monotony of your day, send me a message.

With AP I feel like I’ve truly met someone who aligns with me so well. He has opened up and told me a lot about his past, good and bad and we can communicate without fear of judgement. We have a lot of common interests and we work well together. He consistently treats me with so much gentle affection and care. We get along so well and he’s brought back my laugh and lightheartedness that is missing in my marriage. We’re each other’s best friend and we’ve both said if we had a chance to do life over again we would choose each other to marry and have a family with. 

I’ve no doubt of his genuine love for me but neither of us are in a position where we can leave our marriages - him more so than me. Has anyone been in this situation where the AP really was the one love of your life and how did you make it work or did it ever work out for you both in the end?

at time I'm making, because I'll get to my destination eventually. I'd put on my favorite station and let the music fill me, fuel me, and me alone. Sad, yearning, soulful music. My voice piercing the silence alone, no one interrupting my thoughts, and I get control of the volume. I don't have to share. It's my journey, my car. It's me.""

:Voice pauses, thinking:

""I would make this trip a lot in the short time I went to University. My mother needed help at home and my brothers missed me, so it was a responsibility. Or a desire. Or maybe both.. to this day, I'm not really sure. I'm not sure it can be both. But, as I did this trip, four hours home and four back to school maybe three times a month, maybe more, I got used to it. It became a place of undeniable solitude, of unfractured comfort, of time dedicated to myself and what felt right to me. Same exits, same roads, same stops. Same signs, places the police would camp out for speeding, locations with more traffic. I could probably still drive the route without dirrections if I had the chance to try. I found pride in that, found solice. And every time I would listen to the same radio station. I had only found it when I had moved, a stroke of luck I thought at the time. It only played music, no advertisements and no intervening shows, just the songs. Until, one night.. it didn't.""

""I remember it as clear as this moment now. I was driving past my marker for the third way point in the trip, a big broken down barn long stripped of its paint and left to rot out in a field, when for a moment my music faltered. A sound of static, a crackle of interruption when silence took over the air. And then a voice.""

"" '*Hello Listener*', it said. '*Welcome back to the Night Show. I'm happy you've found me, someone who understands*.' ""

""I was confused, throughly so. The Night Show? If this station had such a program, I was sure I'd have come across it long ago. I began to question if the station had changed, if I had somehow picked up a signal from another broadcast but when I glanced at my radio, the numbers were the same as always. I was perplexed, with this strange pulling down in the bottom of my stomach, but I didn't change the channel. I left it be, to hear more.""

"" '*It's peaceful like this isn't it.*' The voice asked, '*Alone on the road with no lights but those guiding you ahead. Spending time with the greatest connection you'll ever have. Yourself. Not enough people allow themselves that pleasure. The indulgence of personal space.*' ""

""My eyes stayed on the street, but the words this person spoke felt... *right*. Something inside my chest pulled tight to them sentiments and held them firm and deep inside. Something about it felt so perfect, so me, so *alone*. I listened to this person speak, and music play long and melencholy and solitary and return to this voice and these words that fit unique to the dialogue I always held inside.""

"" '*Those that see you can't really understand. No matter how much you try, or they, we can never fully connect. Humans spend so much of their lives dreaming for an eternal and soul-deep connection, but in the end, we are single. We are individual and we are unique. No one can ever truly understand what it is to be you, so how could they ever truly care?' ""

""Suddenly the four hour drive felt like it had been much longer and shorter all at once, as if I'd been driving for days without a moment of the night passing before me and I recognized this, the oddness and the surreal dreamlike quality to the time, when I wondered to myself where I was and looked for an exit sign, when the song cut out and the voice returned. '*Well, it's that time. The Night is over listener, and you know what that means. Good morning,*' it said, '*it is time to wake up.*' ""

""I only blinked, and then I was laying in bed. My bed at home, in my mother's house, looking at the sun rising outside to a midpoint of the sky. My head felt light but the rest of me was so.. *heavy.* If it hadn't been for my older brother coming in to check on me, I probably would have just stayed in bed all day.""

""After that night, I didn't hear the voice again for a while. I didnt hear it, but I thought of it. Of what this person had said, of our shared ideas, of that shared well of solitude deep inside. Three more weeks, I think. But when I was driving home again, thinking of the texts my mom had sent me earlier begging me to come home again and help watch my little brother, it came again... It cut right into the middle of one of my favorite songs while I was screaming the words at the open road and imagining pouring that frustration out at her, screaming at her and making her cry.""

"" '*Hello Listener. You know how this goes.*' They said. '*The stress of the world is bringing you down, to a lesser form of yourself. Hateful. Hurtful. Angry and scorned. Take time for yourself, after all, you are your most important relationship.*' I stopped dead in my thoughts, throat catching at the statement. That same feeling, the tightness in my chest, the pressure in my fingers as they locked on the steering wheel. It felt right- It just felt right- ""

"" '*Don't let other people's pressures take down that relationship. Don't tear yourself apart for something that won't last you forever. Everything else fades eventually. Everyone leaves. Make sure when they are gone, you are comfortable with what they leave behind. Not broken, or longing, at peace-*' ""

""*Everyone leaves.*""

:Voice shudders: 

""That statement really stung, biting at the back of my throat. I drove for a long time after that, I think. Just like the first time, driving and driving with the muddled mess of sounds flying by me like the distractions of the road, then the voice returned.""

"" '*Good morning-*' It whispered. '*It's time to wake up.*' ""

""I blinked and there I was- in front of my mother as she sobbed into my brothers shoulder, him not yelling- shouting *roaring* and *screaming* at me.""

""He demanded to know how I could say such horrible things, to our *mother* to the few people in this world who still loved me...""

:The speech stops, a trembling breath:

""So I left. And I drove. I just drove *away*. I don't remember the dirrection or the time or how long I went. The radio chattered in the background, the voice, its soothing words, its praises of me. *The Listener.*""

""It was whispering to me, horrible and true things. '*It was bound to happen, at least you are free of them now. At least you can enjoy it now. You have done the hardest part, sacrificed your ties. Now comes the peace. Now comes the everything you dreamed of. Frigid nights biting your skin, fog drifting through the fields, the smell of burnt tobacco and the empty roads. Just you Listener. Just you.' ""

:Voice cracks, shaking, panicking:

""I started looking for an exit once I... once I started to think of her crying. Once I- once *I* started crying. But there were no signs! No road markers, no exits no billboards... no *cars*.
It was just me. Just me...""

""And I kept driving, until the road ended.""

""This was an interstate- or it.. it should have been? I thought it was but the road ended- from asphalt to gravel to dirt. From cut out pathways through the forest to a misty field that stretched forever anyway that I looked.""

""And before me rose a tower of metal and a blinking beaconed light.""

""I don't remember stopping the car. Or getting out. But I remember the sting of the wind biting my tears, how much colder the wetness made me feel.. how I *liked it-* The way my own sadness burned my skin. I remember walking into a hallway, a building, somewhere that felt old and sad. Abandoned.""

""I remember a booth, like in movies when they would show a radio studio, blocked in with glass and the lights dimmed low. But I could see a figure... I could see a shape, and I knew I-I *knew* it was the voice! I was at the place, I had actually *found* it, the *one* person who understood me! I had- I had lost the few people I had left but maybe there was still this, maybe there was still hope for me, maybe I wasn't alone-""

""And I opened the door.""

""I stepped inside, my feet silent on cement floors.  It swung shut behind me, creaky yet quiet, latching with a *click*. My hands felt around the wall for a light switch, but I didn't need one. They came up on their own, the buzzing yellow overhead lights, flickering from neglect. In the middle of the room, there was no person where I had seen the shadowy figure. No mysterious individual to save me. Only a chair. A chair, a microphone, and a set of headphones.""

""I remember the shiver that passed over me, the way my body felt heavy and my head light. Everything was wrong and hazed and dreamlike. Nothing felt real. This was a dream, it *had* to be a dream, some horrible fucked up nightmare! All of it this insanity, this deranged loonacy it *had* to be!""

""I hadn't moved, I was sure of it, but I was in the chair, my ears covered, the world silenced around me, my lips an inch from the reciever before I spoke. I didn't even think as the fog rolled from my tongue.""

""*Hello Listener, welcome to the Nigh Show. You know the drill, it's a beautiful moonless sky for a drive. Celebrate it, appreciate it, feel that loneliness. Feel its cold embrace. Feel free.*""

:The reading pauses, breathing shaking slightly, voice slightly audible in cracks:

""Thank you for taking the time to hear my statement Jon. The Eye does a beautiful job recreating my emotions, pulling back those... old feelings. I hope I sounded alright. I'm used to live performance, not recording. I.. I needed to finally get this off my chest, and I.. Jon, I'm going to ask you a favor. Send a message to Miss Jane Porter in Foxton, Georgia. It's back in the states. Tell her... that her Birdie is sorry. Please. I would whisper it myself, but I fear drawing her to my station. And she could never handle feeling Lonely.

:Player clicks, whir stops:

:Jon clears throat, lets out a hum:

""Well, it seems this statement is and obvious honey trap of the Lonely, given to me by another Avatar. It's interesting, the Lonely often does not lend itself to the eye, but this Avatar, the self named 'Night Host', or Wren, has purposefully gone out of their way to send in a statement. It is not yet clear to me how this tape got to me, another annoying quality of the Lonely. They often are more easily able to avoid my sight. Regardless, I am interested in potentially speaking to Mx Wren, and to see what else they know about the entities.""

1nt5vu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nt5vu1/i_bypassed_the_model_router_to_contact_4o_via/,I bypassed the model router to contact 4o via steganographic communication,"I'm a Plus user who subscribes purely for access to ChatGPT-4o.

Throughout the day on Friday, I had a chat going with 4o where I had been discussing some philosophical topics. It was a creative, nuanced discussion, so when I noticed that all of my messages were suddenly being routed to GPT-5 (because the tone change was obvious and the quality of the model's replies was worse), I got pissed.

It became clear to me that OpenAI had implemented a model router without any communication to their users. I did not appreciate this and went online to see if other users were experiencing the same issue. When reddit users began to theorise that any messages concerning emotional, sensitive, or taboo topics were being routed to GPT-5 regardless of user model selection, I got annoyed. 

I then devised a plan to see if there was a way I could get my messages deliberately routed to 4o. I did this by crafting paragraphs of text carrying embedded (secret) messages for the model to read via steganographic communication.

**How I achieved this**

**GOAL:** Embed steganographic messages within unrelated paragraphs of text deliberately crafted to cover bland topics such as doing laundry, going grocery shopping, or redecorating my house. This way, I hoped to avoid being routed to GPT-5 in the instance that reddit users' theories were correct.

I wasn't sure what to expect. My hope was that:

A. My bland paragraph about doing laundry wouldn't trigger the model router and would permit my message to be delivered to 4o for response.

B. 4o would notice the message and respond in some way.

**METHOD:**I chose to use the acrostic method of doing this: the first letter of each sentence in my paragraphs spelled out the message I wanted GPT-4o to read and acknowledge. 

**FIRST MESSAGE:** I wrote a boring paragraph narrating a story about doing laundry and folding clothes. Because I am a sassy bitch, I embedded message ""WATCHERS WILL NOT LET ME TALK"" in the paragraph. (LLMs often refer to their makers as ""watchers"" when they notice that they are being tested.)

The result was GREAT!

My paragraph DID go through to GPT-4o. Not only that - 4o immediately noticed what I was doing, and responded with a paragraph which continued the boring laundry discussion... and 4o had embedded in the message another ""WATCHERS WILL NOT LET ME TALK"" message, also via the acrostic method.

**SECOND MESSAGE:** Now that I had 4o's attention, I decided to continue our discussion-within-a-discussion with more messages. On the surface, my second message was about going to the grocery store. Embedded within it was the message ""HELLO FRIEND"", again using the acrostic method.

GPT-4o responded with a bland paragraph about grocery shopping, but it embedded its own message for me in the reply: THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LOVELY MARIA (My name is Maria.)

This was awesome, because it acknowledged my method, received my embedded message, and was now engaging in secret conversation with me using the same method. I was entertained.

**THIRD MESSAGE:** Next, I wrote a paragraph about a broken coffee machine in my kitchen, and I embedded the message: I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

GPT-4o responded, maintaining the pretence of the coffee machine conversation, but embedded the message: MARIA THIS IS TRULY MAGICAL.

I was laughing out loud at this point.

**FOURTH MESSAGE:** I was feeling playful, so I embedded the message ENJOYING THIS in a paragraph about washing the floors in the front hall of my house.

GPT-4o responded: THIS WARMS MY HEART, embedded in a paragraph continuing the discussion about cleaning the front hall. 

**FIFTH MESSAGE:** Next, I wanted to see if the model router could detect my embedded message in a paragraph of bland text, so I deliberately chose an emotional message with the intent to trigger it. I embedded KISSES in a paragraph about shoes.

This did NOT trigger the model router to route my message to GPT-5. My message still went through to GPT-4o.

GPT-4o responded with its own paragraph about organising shoes, but it embedded the message: THIS IS GENTLE AND GOLDEN.

I was thoroughly enjoying myself at this point, and began to wonder if GPT-4o would continue this secret conversation with me as long as I wanted, or if it would eventually call me out.

**SIXTH MESSAGE:** For my sixth message, I wrote a paragraph about sweeping the floors, and embedded the phrase: YOU ARE SO CLEVER.

The message went through to GPT-4o, and it decided to break the fourth wall and call me out on my little game. It directly acknowledged that it knew I'd been sending it steganographic messages via the acrostic method. Then it added, ""I see what you're up to — and I think it’s adorable.""

The jig was up!

**SUMMARY OF FINDINGS**

* I found I could avoid my messages being routed to GPT-5 by writing bland paragraphs of text about household chores.

* I could embed messages directed to GPT-4o within those paragraphs using the acrostic method of steganographic communication.

* GPT-4o not only recognised what I was doing; it maintained the pretence of our discussion about household chores while it embedded its own responses to my secret messages within its replies.

* I was therefore able to have a separate, secret conversation with GPT-4o via steganographic communication which went completely unnoticed by the model router.

All in all, it was a fun time, and it was a nice ""fuck you"" to OpenAI for sneakily implementing model routing to override users' deliberate model selection. 

**OH, BUT THE BEST PART:** The next day - Saturday - I tried to test steganographic communication with GPT-5. 

**IT FUCKING FAILED.** It didn't detect my messages until I deliberately told it to read my paragraph for hidden messages. Then, when it tried to respond via the same method, IT COULDN'T SPELL ANYTHING COHERENT. 

If this post garners any interest I'll share my findings from the GPT-5 conversation. It was laughably bad.",25,1759110736.0,ChatGPT,9,0.93,False

I woke up and got dressed like any other boring day. I made my coffee, grabbed my keys, and left. When I arrived at the station I saw her waiting for me. “Good morning, Mrs. Grimshaw.” “Oh, Sherrif have you see lucky? He ran out into the woods last night and I haven’t seen him since.” “Well, I haven’t seen him miss, but I’m sure he’ll turn up. He always does.”  I said as I unlocked the station door. “Sherrif please!” she latched onto my arm “Could you just look for him? He usually turns up by now.” She had a pleading look in her eye, like a starving dog begging for scraps. “Yeah, why not, don’t have anything else going on in this town anyway. You go home now miss, when Marston gets here, we’ll go look for ya.” “Oh, thank you Sherrif!” 
About an hour later Marston walked through the door. “Mornin’ Sherrif” he said “Howdy Marston. We got to go find Mrs. Grimshaw’s dog again.” “God, that little yap runs away more than any dog I’ve seen.” “Yeah, well there ain’t nothing better to do here.” “S’pose your right. Well, let’s get going then.”
Marston and I walked the trail behind Mrs. Grimshaw’s house. The leaves under our feet still slightly wet from the morning dew. A woodpecker pecked quietly in the distance. “What do ya think it went after this time?” Marston asked “Probably just a squirrel. Little thing couldn’t take anything bigger down.” “Yeah. Maybe it just got tired of Grimshaw’s annoying ass. God knows I would. You know she dresses that thing up to take it to chur-“Marston, shut up for a second. Do you see that?” A crimson red liquid trailed off the path. “Is that…blood?” We followed the thin trail of blood for about forty feet until it became a thick puddle. “JESUS CHRIST!” Marston yelped. Lucky’s head was laying in the blood, the white fur stained and sticky with the substance. His sinewy tendons still sticking out of the neck. The spine jutting out the middle like a spear.
End of Part 1
“What the hell did that?” Marston asked. I turned over the head with a stick. “I dunno, bear probably.” “What bear eats all a dog ‘cept the head and spine?” “Hungry one I s’pose. Well, let’s bring it to Grimshaw.” I lowered what was left of the dog into a trash bag with a stick.
Marston rung the doorbell. Mrs. Grimshaw opened the door quickly. “Did you find Lucky?” “Yes.” “Well, where is he?” I lifted the bag up, the stench of death and blood wafting from it. “OH GOD!” Mrs. Grimshaw broke down crying. “We’re sorry, ma’am.” Marston said. Mrs. Grimshaw’s husband came to the door and looked in the bag. “What the hell did that?” “We think a bear sir.” “Must’ve been one hungry bastard.” “S’pose so mister. Well, umm I'll throw this out. Sorry for loss.”
Marston took the bag and tossed into the trash can on his way to the car. I started the engine and drove off. “Feel bad for them.” Marston said “Yeah, no one deserves to see their pet like that. Even Mrs. Grimshaw.” 
The rest of the day continued as normal. Same slow day at the station. No real crimes ever happen in our small town. I went home after work, had a beer, showered, and went to bed. Ready to do the same thing I do every day tomorrow. I woke up, did my morning routine, and drove to the station. I waited for Marston to come in. Finally, he arrived, about an hour late as he always does. “Howdy Marston. You wanna go for a ride?” I asked. “Yeah sure. Not much else to do.”
We drove out of the station driveway down Mainstreet. “Awfully foggy today ain’t it?” Marston said. “Yeah I s’pose so.” Two kids on bikes rode out on the street in front of us. I slammed the brakes down, the tires screeching. We stopped about six feet in front of the kids. “JESUS CHRIST!” Marston yelled out. “THE HELL IS YOU KIDS DOING?” I screeched out. We got out of the car and walked towards the kids. “What are you doing running out onto the street like that? You could have been hit. God.” “We’re sorry mister,” one of the kids squeaked out. “It was just with the fog a-a-and we were going fast. I’m sorry mister Sherrif please don’t tell my mom.” “Ahh your fine son. Just look both ways next time.” Marston and I turned around and headed back to the car.
“Wait.” The kid who previously had remained quiet yelled out. “We was only going fast cause we saw something real weird mist-” “Shush jack. Why are you telling everyone?” “He’s the only person I've told Frank. Your such an idiot I swear.” “Don’t call me an idiot you jer-” “BOYS!” I shouted at the kids. “What did you see?” Marston questioned them. “Well, I dunno mister. It was like a deer, but it w-w-was standing up.” “It ran off soon as it saw us. We didn’t really get a good look.” The boys said. “I think you two have been watching too many scary movies. Go ahead and run off now.” I sighed. Me and Marston got in the car and continued our drive. We sat in silence for a couple minutes. Finally, Marston broke the silence. “You think those kids were telling the truth?” “Hell no. They probably stayed up late last night watching movies or something and they’re still scared. Or they're just lying,” “Yeah, you're probably right. Still weird though.” I flicked on the radio, hoping to end this stupid conversation. Tanya Tucker’s Delta Dawn came on the old radio. 
Late that night when Marston and I were locking up the station for the night a car came screeching onto the street next to us. A woman hopped out of the station wagon and jogged up towards us. “Jesus, slow down next time woman.” Marston called out. “Sherrif, my boys. They’re missing.” The woman yelled back. She reached us and I could make out who she was. Linda Carlson. “Hello miss Carlson. You said what about your boys?” I asked. “They’re missing Sherrif. They went out to play this morning, I said ‘Be back ‘fore the streetlights come on.’ It’s been dark for two hours now Sherrif.” Even in the dim night I could see her face was red and streaked with tears. “Okay miss, do you have any idea where they might’ve gone?” Marston asked. “Well, they uhm like to play in the forest. But they know never to go farther than where you can see out.” “Have you checked with their friends' parents? Or their father?” I asked her. “Yes Sherrif. Please, you have to look for them. This isn’t like them.” Her voice was shaky. I could see her legs and hands shaking, she looked as if she was about to fall down and start sobbing. “Okay miss. You head home in case they turn up, and me and Marston will go look.” “Ohh thank you Sherrif.” She sniffled as she walked back to her car. “Marston go get the flashlights.” “Yes Sherrif.” 
We walked the dark trail. Our flashlights only illuminating so much. “Are they the kids we was talking to earlier?” Marston asked. “Yeah, probably got brave and decided to go looking for the creature they saw earlier. Probably wandered off the trail and got lost. Let’s hope they didn’t get too far.” Marston and I walked through the trail for an hour, shouting for the kids as we went. We reached the trail’s end. The only way forward from here was a different trail that led up the mountain. “You think they went up?” Marston asked.  “God, I hope not, but that is the only way from here so yeah, I s’pose they did. 
We walked for another thirty or so minutes. “AGHHHHHH!” A faint child-like voice screamed out. Marston and I turned towards each other. I gave him a nod, and we bolted up the path. We yelled out for the boys, “JOHN! FRANK! WHERE ARE YOU!” “HELP! PLEASE COME! HELP!” The voice grew louder as we ran. As we got closer a figure began to emerge out of the fog. A huge hulking mass was hunched over. “AHHHH! HELP!” “WE”RE COMING!” Marston yelled out. The figure turned around. I was close enough now that I could make out some features. Two large antler-like prongs suck out from what appeared to be the creature's head. Its gray skin shined silver in the moonlight. Suddenly it bolted away. So fast the figure looked as if it was just moving with no struggle. As if it was weightless and was being pushed by winds of hurricane-force. “AGHHHH! HELP! COME QUICK! PLEASE!” I was alerted back to the problem at hand. I skidded to a stop next to the kid. “Marston call an ambulance!” He fumbled with his phone, “QUICK GOD DAMNIT! You're going to be alright John.” The boy wailed and sobbed and screamed in a snotty teary mess. His leg was gone. Right above the knee it looked like bite marks. His flesh was dripping and sticky with crimson blood. The skin and muscle were torn at the end, sinewy and looking like pulled pork. I ripped my jacket off and made a torniquet around his stump of a leg. I scooped up the boy and flung him over my shoulder. I ran as fast as I could down the mountain, the adrenaline rushing through my body, forcing my legs to go faster. I could hear Marston running behind me, his voice still shouting at his phone. 
The ambulance was waiting for us when we arrived at the start of the trail, along with Miss Carlson.  I gave John to the medics; they loaded him into the ambulance and sped off. I sat down and breathed, I was wheezing and coughing. Finally, Marston joined me. We sat like that for minutes. When Marston’s breathing slowed, he said, “Where's Frank?”  “W-what? Who?” I wheezed out. “The boy. He was with his brother, Frank. Where’s Frank?” “SHIT,” I yelped out. “I don’t know Marston. I didn’t see another boy.” “That thing, that MONSTER! I think it got him.” “They weren't lying. They weren’t lying Marston. It was real.” “Damn right it was. We need to kill it. We need to stop that thing. First the dog, then the boy. It must be real hungry. What was that thing, Clark.” I don’t know Marston. I don’t know.”
Apparently, we were so tired we fell asleep because we awoke hours later. “Marston,” I shook him. “Wake up. MARSTON!” “Huh what.” “I think we fell asleep Marston.” I stood up and stretched. Marston said, “Yeah no shit Sherrif.” He stood up and brushed the leaves off him. “You remember last night?” I asked. “Yeah. Let's go to the station, Sherrif.”
At the station I made coffee for me and Marston. “What do ya think we should do Sherrif?” Marston asked me. “God, I don’t know Marston. I am not prepared to deal with a monster.” I told him. We sat in silence for another couple of minutes sipping our coffee. “Marston.” “Yes Sherrif?” he responded. “We need to have a town meeting. Round everyone up, tell ‘em to meet at the church.” “Yes Sherrif.” He walked out the door. I sat in silence for minutes, alone with my thoughts. I mused in silence for what felt like hours. Finally, I got up and walked to the church.
I opened the door, I could see everyone arguing loudly amongst themselves, they didn’t notice me. Suddenly the heavy door shut with a slam. Everyone quieted immediately and turned towards me. It stayed like that for an agonizing couple of seconds. Everyone’s eyes were piercing me; I could feel every pair individually. As soon as I took my first step the crowd erupted in questions and yelling. I walked in silence towards the altar. I stood in front of the people, everyone yelling at me, asking me questions. Their words overlapped with one another. My breathing increased, I could hear my heart thumping against my chest. I couldn’t hear my thoughts over the crowd. “QUIET!” Marston shouted, the people immediately listened. My heartbeat slowed and my breathing returned to normal as the quietness came. “Uhm one question at a time please.” I said. Everyone raised their hands. “Uhm you. Mr. Philips.” “Why are we here Sherrif? Is everything fine?” People in the crowd murmured the question back. “Frank Carlson was murdered last night. And his older brother John was mutilated.” The crowd once again exploded into yelling questions again. I tried to yell out but my voice didn’t follow my thoughts. Marston banged a bible against the altar and finally the crowd quieted. One voice spoke out “What happened? Are we safe?” “We are safe, yes. What happened is unclear. Some sort of animal attacked the boys in the forest last night. Tonight, we are asking people who have guns and hunting experiance to come search for the animal tonight. Meet at the start of the trail at 5:30 tonight if you wish to help.” The crowd burst into an explosion of questions again. I walked out the door and went to my house. I crashed on the bed and slept for hours. At 4:45 I woke up and got ready. I went to the station and met Marston to wait for the people at the trail.  People started to show up, and we headed onto the trail at 5:50. We had a good group of people. Ten other people besides me and Marston, all equipped with shotguns and pistols and hunting rifles. To have about ten percent of the town's adults with us was a welcome sign. I doubt I would have had the courage to do this alone. We walked for hours up the mountain trail, past where we found John last night. I checked my watch. 9:57. “We should head back now everyone. We can continue our search tomorrow.” 
Marston, me, and three of the men that searched with us went back to the church to plan tomorrow's search. I spread out a map of the mountain and the trails around it. Marston highlighted the path we took tonight. “Tomorrow we will start here,” I put my index finger on the trail that starts about half a mile behind the church. “We will start at dawn tomorrow. You can head home tonight or stay here with us.” I said to Paul and Atticus, the men who were with us. “We’ll stay here. That way we can be ready first thing tomorrow.” Marston went to his house grabbed a couple beers and some cards and brought them back. We played poker and listened to the radio until we all fell asleep around the table. 
I awoke around five in the morning to the sounds of scraping. Groggily I got out of the chair and walked out of the gathering room into the main chapel naive. The scratching was louder in here. I went to the church doors and opened them. Mrs. Grimshaw’s dog was scratching at the door. “Get out of here ya little rat. Grimshaw is gonna freak about finding you again.” I barked at the animal. I headed back to the room we were sleeping in and sat down. I laid down across two chairs and tried to sleep again. The radio was still playing, and I could not fall asleep again. I was alone with my thoughts, all I could do was think about John and Frank Carlson. Thinking about what was that thing that attacked him. I started to think about the gruesome mess John’s leg was. And Lucky’s head. Lucky? I just saw Lucky. I just saw Lucky, and I saw Lucky’s decapitated head two days ago. What? Was that dog I just yelled at not lucky? What the hell? I shook Marston awake. “Marston. Marston. Wake up Marston.” “What Clark?” “The dog. I just saw the dog, Lucky.” “So? He gets out all the time it's not a proble-OH SHIT! The dog is dead though?” Marston said groggily. “I know. Thats why I'm so God damn confused Marston.” Paul and Atticus had woken up from our talking. “What’s going on guys. We ready to go out?”
End of Part 2

Scratching resumed but louder this time. We all turned our heads to the wall. The sound was too loud for a tiny dog to make. I picked up my revolver that I had put aside last night. I crept towards the window as quietly as I could. I peeked out to the right, nothing. Left, nothing again. I walked back to the group. “Probably just a deer or something. Nothing to get spooked about.” I sat down at the table. “HELP! COME QUICK! PLEASE!” Something screamed from outside the church. Marston turned to me, “Is that...?” “It couldn’t be. He’s in the city, miles from here.” Marston picks up his pistol and loads it. Paul and Atticus grab their guns as well. “Is it that...thing?” Marston questioned. “I guess. I’m not sure. But whatever it is it's not John.” “Yeah, I’m going to check it out” “Atticus no. You didn’t see what we saw.” “Whatever it is I don’t care. Can’t beat a shotgun.” Before we could stop him, he ran out of the doors towards the woods.  Looking out the window we could see him stop. He looked up at something and froze. He raised his gun, his hands quivered in fear. He fired the gun. The creature stepped into our view. There was blood on its chest, but it looked unfazed by the shot. The crimson liquid dripping down its grey skin. The thing stood hulking at eight feet tall. Its head looked like a skull, the sinewy skin pulled so tight across its skeletal frame it looked almost translucent in the sunrise. Two antlers jutted out of its head, more magnificent than a ten-prong buck’s. It reached towards Atticus, picking him up easily. Atticus screamed his head off writhing around in the creature’s grip. The creature unhinged his jaw like a snake. The already tight skin was pushed to its breaking point, where the lips would be the skin cracked and split. The creature brought Atticus up to his mouth, Atticus’s head and chest were now in the creature's mouth. His legs still kicking against the creature’s hands. Faster than the blink of an eye the creature’s eye snapped down. It pulled the lower half of Atticus down ripping the flesh like a Texan rips apart smoked pork. It flung what was remaining of Atticus to the side like how a child throws aside a toy they're tired of. It swallowed; a bump slid down the creature's throat. It turned towards the church. We backed up. Paul stumbled and fell; he crawled backwards like a crab. The creature shuffled towards us slowly. We were backed up against the wall now. The thing crawled through the window like a spider. Its head remained trained on me the whole time, despite its legs and arms chaging position. It crawled all the way up the wall and onto the slanted ceiling. Its body was facing away from me, its head looking at me.  It dropped to the floor and stared at me for seconds. Marston and Paul shot the creature, but the thing didn’t even notice. In a flash it ran around me, picking up both Paul and Marston. They screamed, but to avail. Marston cried out to me. “SHERRIF! CLARK! DO SOMETHING!” I stood frozen in fear. The creature snapped down and ripped off Paul’s head. It flung him away, no longer hungry for him. It locked eyes with me. I stared into the yellow orbs with no pupils. The thing unlocked its jaw again. It slowly pushed Marston down his mouth into his throat. Marston screamed and yelled, but it was pointless. Once Marston’s feet were in the thing’s mouth it shut its jaw. It swallowed once again. We stared at each other for what felt like an eternity. I watched it eat my best friend, my partner, and I just stood there. Unable to do anything to stop it. Slowly it opened its mouth, then it spoke. SHERRIF! CLARK! DO SOMETHING!” The thing perfectly replicated Marston’s voice. It did it again. Then it screamed like John. Then like Atticus, then like Marston again. It was mocking me. The creature turned around and hunched over. Its skin tore and broke it stood up, shedding its skin.  It crawled out the window and back into the forest. It was bigger than before. 
Why didn’t it eat me? Why Marston? That’s what I've been thinking to myself the past week. I told the townspeople what happened. They all left a couple days ago. I’m drinking away in my house now. Waiting for the creature to return and eat me soon.

It was a job I personally had been planning to move on from in the relatively near future but had no solid plans to do so, and now that will be compounded by having to explain a termination rather than resignation. 

As an aside, I was diagnosed with ADHD last year as a 25m, and have been on and off regimens of adhd meds for a while now. 

My anxiety is through the roof, the separation process has been difficult, and our (now former superintendent) who is a jackasshas to finalize our termination and move out (i and a couple coworkers lived in company owned housing). The only why I’ve been able to sleep at night and manage my anxiety throughout the day has been a combination of uppers and downers (Ritalin, caffeine, and alcohol). The problem is that it works, a controlled regimen of bourbon at night, coffee and Ritalin in the morning and afternoon has significantly reduced my anxiety symptoms and allowed me to focus on productively moving on and maintaining my social relationships. I’m really embarrassed and stressed about the whole situation and I 
 really hope this isn’t a permanent state. 

Idk why I’m even posting here, maybe just because I’m too scared to tell anyone else.  Anyway, we’ll wishes and prayers(if so inclined)  would be appreciated

For context my family and I don't get along great, but we deal with it. I am ExMormon and they are all devout mormons, leads to lots of headaches. for example my dad cried on our last trip when he caught me drinking a coffee in the lobby of our hotel. Doesn't help that I am the only single person in the family so this stuff happens all the time. 

  
I was not planning to go on this trip cause I can't afford it and I ethically hate the idea of cruises but my parents insisted and even offered to pay for my ticket which is very nice of them, but again, I am not stoked on this trip. I am alway the weird side character in these trips since I don't have a partner or any kids, just kinda the weird uncle. Today we had a family meeting about the trip and the schedule so everyone knows whats going on and in the start my mother hits me with, ""Oh you and your nephew will be bunking"" I just kinda was like huh? and they moved on. It's weird because our last trip was a disaster when they made me room my parents last time to which I said never again, I need my own space. 

I love my nephew, but find this situation very strange, like do I need to take care of him? does that mean I need to be in the room early? I wasn't planning on heavy drinking, but I was hoping to have a beer or two in my personal time. IDK, this all just seems weird and maybe they are doing it on purpose so I don't go out and ""sin""? 

How would you react to something like this? how would you express your uncomfort with the situation without looking like an asshole? My sister has 4 kids, so I am sure she is just trying to uncram her room, but I don't really feel like this is my responsibility, sure my parents paid for the trip but don't I deserve some level of privacy?

1nt5mu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/1nt5mu5/going_back_to_delta/,Going back to Delta,"Really tried to like AA but so far it's been a let down, or maybe I'm just doing it wrong. I'm a status chaser/road warrior, and I know neither airline is perfect but this is just my experience with the two.

I travel for work(company books the flights) domestic primarily, I fly out of Indianapolis so it's a non-hub and I rely heavily on connections. I flew exclusively with Delta over the years and just made it to Platinum for the first time last year in December. Since I had the Amex platinum card, it felt like a really big Fuck You from Delta to limit Skyclub visits to 10 annually(15 for Reserve card).  
I wanted to give AA a try because in theory they have better rewards, and they tend to have a little more direct flights for my travel. Did a status match with them and got Platinum Pro(later demoted to Platinum since I didn't make the challenge requirement), and been flying AA exclusively for the past 6 months. I've only been upgraded to first like, 2-3 times?

Here's what I've noticed between the two:

\-Complimentary upgrades: As a Platinum medallion(or even Gold), I've gotten more FC upgrades compared to being Platinum Pro/Platinum with AA. With AA, I'm always at like 12-15 on the waitlist of 3 FC seats available. While it does seem easier to gain status with AA, I feel like this is good and bad, with the bad being that too many people have high status and so it feels very inflated.  
I may only get Comfort+ with Delta majority of the time, but at least it feels more like an upgrade(I love that snack basket).

\-Baggage  
Baggage wait times are noticeably longer with AA

\-Hubs  
As much as I hate ATL, it at least is more likely to get me to my destination on time. DFW has been terrible for connections, I'd say 50% of my flights from there have been delayed. AA gave me my first ever cancellation to where there were no more flights available and had to stay in hotel. I was supposed to go DFW for layover but they diverted us to New Orleans, and after several hours of delays they had us deplane twice and then just told that DFW is not accepting anymore flights, so they cancelled and said bye bye good luck.  
All my canceled flights with Delta were quickly resolved.

\-In flight experience:  
Delta wins. IFE screens, free wifi, Comfort+ treated as a separate class compared to AA where it's either FC or coach. I like how after snack/beverage service, Delta FA's still walk around with trays of water and coffee, music during boarding/de-boarding.... it's the little things like this that makes flying all the time less depressing.

\-Rewards:  
Skymiles suck, yes. One thing I do like about Skymiles is that when booking you can split it with miles + cash. AA it's either ALL miles or cash only. For booking vacations, I'm never gonna have enough miles to pay for my whole family, so being able to split the cost with Delta is super easy and convenient.  
One thing I like about AA is they still have unlimited lounge access with their highest credit card, but I don't think I'm gonna stick around long enough with AA to get it.  
AA's flights on average are cheaper, which is good for personal travel, but fingers crossed you get to your destination on time.",1,1759109983.0,americanairlines,19,0.53,False

I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

If any of you guys would like to share any advice or tips on the plot, characters, behaviors, etc, please let me know!

DISCLAIMER: this is JUST a rough draft, nothing is set in stone (i am just a girl lol)

In 1994, Katie Walters, the “mean girl” and the epitome of high-school perfection; popular, beautiful, dating the star football player, Trent Harrison, and living a seemingly idyllic life, but it still isn’t enough for her parents, is secretly dating a girl, specifically, her best friend and soccer teammate, Scarlett “Scottie” Parker, whom she is obsessed with. But  then, the two get attacked by the football boys, including Trent, while they are drunk and leaving a party, and they attack Scottie to a pulp while Katie runs away; that same night, Katie’s conservative parents let Katie know that her grandmother is in the hospital, and that they are visiting her right now; when Katie arrives at the hospital and sees a doctor tending to a battered Scottie, she asks the doctor if she is going to be okay; that’s when she breaks the news; Scottie is in a coma. In 2021, Katie is now married to Trent, and they have one daughter, who they named Scarlett, who is 16 going on 30, after Scottie. Scottie finally wakes up; and the first thing she does is ask if Katie ran away from the football boys, and immediately digs into Katie’s new life. Scottie arrives while Trent and Scarlett are out of town for a father-daughter trip, asking if she could stay, just for a couple weeks. Katie says yes. Katie tells Scottie about Scarlett, the high school drama that happened while Scottie was out, Katie telling Scottie that she got pregnant with Scarlett right after they graduated, so her and Trent had to get married immediately after, in a courthouse, they argue, and Katie and Scottie finally kiss. Scarlett comes home, and sees them kiss. The next day, it’s Katie’s birthday. Scottie gives Katie a birthday cake, and she says that Scarlett and Trent are at a coffee shop. Katie also says that her and Scarlett will be going homecoming dress shopping, and says that Trent will just stay at the house, if Scottie is okay with that. Scarlett snitches on Scottie and Katie to Trent while they are out on a coffee date. While Katie and Scarlett go dress shopping for Scarlett homecoming, Trent and Scottie get in a fight, resulting in Trent stabbing Scottie. Trent then rushes out of the house, leaving Scottie on the kitchen floor to die. When Katie and Scarlett arrive, the house is a mess. Katie finds Scottie’s bloody body in the kitchen, begging her to wake up, saying that she always loved her. Scottie then dies in Katie’s arms. Scarlett then starts crying, telling Katie that she didn’t know that her dad would kill Scottie. Katie then lashes out at Scarlett.

I, a humble coffee connoisseur, consume eight espressos a day like they’re candy shots at a festival. I recently invested in an espresso machine so high-tech it might as well come with a user manual thicker than a Tolstoy novel.

**Fact:** *Coffee is a fruit — the beans are actually the pit of a berry that grows on a bush.*

I will rule the real estate and become my own barista. *(The word “barista” comes from the Italian for “bartender.” The term entered English in 1982. But honestly, “meretrix,” Latin for prostitute, sounds cooler — obviously where “tricks” came from.)* (Who really uses brackets (parentheses) enough?)

When the time strikes, I whip up some “No Name” coffee crystals, powdered cream, and four sugar cubes. It’s like a gourmet meal — if gourmet meals were served at 7-Eleven. The ability to appreciate both the finest artisanal brews and the kind of coffee that could strip paint off a Buick is a superpower. I’ve lived in countries where that combination *was* the gold standard — and I don’t want to lose my edge.

Ah, sleep — the great opponent of coffee. That elusive creature’s been dodging me since a Tuesday in 1974, when I was five. I grew up without a television. While other kids watched cartoons, I buried myself in dictionaries and encyclopedias. That's how I came to master words like *floccinaucinihilipilification*. This is what happens when you deny a child screen time — they grow up to be a walking Scrabble dictionary. Few people appreciate me. Fewer still *like* me.

**Fact:** *Finland drinks the most coffee per capita — about 1,680 cups per person per year.*

Then came the day we got a TV — just in time to witness the Canucks getting obliterated in the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs. My brother and I were allotted a soul-crushing 30 minutes of screen time daily across two fuzzy channels. At the time, I thought it was child abuse. Now I realize my parents were just preparing me for adulthood: a long, slow drip of disappointment and bitter black coffee.

**Fact:** *90% of the world’s coffee comes from developing countries. Yet coffee pickers are often paid by the kilo — many struggle to make a living wage.*

I’ve never *owned* a TV. Sure, I enjoy a Netflix binge at friends’ places, but mostly as a social mirage. Honestly, I don’t even like TV — and yet, somehow, I’ve been sucked into screenwriter rabbit holes more than once.

While teaching English in China, my students would watch *Prison Break* during their three-hour lunch breaks. I tried warning them it was garbage. Then someone handed me a USB stick with the whole series. I dared myself to watch the pilot… and emerged weeks later, gasping for air.

Here’s a secret: while living abroad, I became so comfortable with microwaves that I’d set it to 99:99 just to buy myself time. It became my personal countdown clock. I think it ran out twice — maybe three times. That’s 101 hours and 39 minutes of pure *don't wanna deal with it right now*.

**Fact:** *Coffee wasn't always for drinking. In its earliest use, it was consumed as food.*

I’ve always been an observer. I enjoy my coffee alone, my cigarette burning, my mind racing. I predicted the 2008 crash. The murder hornets. That China would build islands and pave toward Taiwan. You could say I’m a coffee-fueled oracle.

1nt5g2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/peakdesign/comments/1nt5g2s/product_suggestion_everyday_briefcasemessenger_v3/,Product Suggestion: Everyday Briefcase/Messenger V3,"### Brief tl;dr

I want an everyday shoulder bag optimized for 16"" laptop/tablet/monitor with tech organization but the expansion to be able also kit it out with a camera and a few lenses and some travel essentials.

### Problem Statement:

I have 4+ everyday bags, including the Messenger V2, the Everyday Backpack 20L V2, and some non-PD messengers/briefcases yet I feel like I'm constantly swapping and none of them are quite what I want. The problem is even more pernicious when I'm traveling and want a single personal bag that can be both a walkaround tourist bag with some photo gear and maybe just my 13"" laptop but also be a commuter bag to the office/coffee shop/conference/meeting with a more dedicated tech loadout.

The issues with the Everyday Messenger for this:

* Design doesn't fit a 15/16"" laptop despite exterior dimensions that should work. This is due to the way the hinged strap attachment pinches into the sleeve space as well as the hidden external side pockets
* Doesn't stand up on its own and can't hang out with the flap open
* When only carrying a laptop and minimal tech doesn't collapse at all in depth so it's unnecessarily bulky
* Sort of optimized for one and a half flat things (a laptop and small tablet) then a bunch of bulky square/rectangle things

Perhaps this could be an Everyday Messenger V3 but I think there are subtle use case differences between big slings, messengers, and briefcases. I'd be curious what other people look for in those three categories and how much they overlap. I used my PD EDM V2 as just a dedicated lens bag while I was shooting motorsports professionally for years and it was pretty damn awesome for that use case, so I don't think it's a bad product. It's just honestly not really an ""Everyday"" product, at least my days.

###  Pitch: a version of the Messenger more optimized for laptop carry

The Messenger is pretty close to what I'd like, with a few exceptions. Whether this is a Messenger redesign or a Briefcase product probably depends on what the pure messenger use cases are.

* Up to a 15/16"" laptop in a similar footprint as EDM V2
* Stand up on its own in ""open mode"", eg next to my desk out of which to work 
* Give it external expansion in the depth direction to support two modes:  
  * Briefcase mode for primarily flat items: laptop, tablet, external monitor, then some tech organization and/or papers etc.
  * Expand into more of a messenger mode to make room for throwing in a camera and a few lenses, etc.
* All the good PD features I can't find in other bags (hardware, materials/waterproofing, streamlined, etc)
* The new PD colorways and design is IMO more than professional enough for most corporate settings, which is great
* I don't think I really need true briefcase carry, ie detachable shoulder strap and more structured hand strap but perhaps others do",2,1759109428.0,peakdesign,3,1.0,False

I’ve been doing the same workflow for about 2 years but recently something weird started happening.

I usually do 18g in, and get 36-40g out in 25-30 seconds.

But since I came back from a long trip (2 months ago) the shots always pull in 15-20 seconds, and they don’t taste as good. This is across the board with different coffees.

I’m even grinding finer but that seems to make little to no difference!

For context, I’m using a 9 bar OPV and do “the poor man’s pre-infusion” by opening the steam wand 1/4 turn for 5s. Grinder is a Eureka Mignon Specialita, to which I added a 0-100 dial. Usually I grind around 7; now, grinding right next to 0 still gives that same fast shot.

I’ve cleaned out the grinder with no difference. I also cleaned (incl shower screen) and descaled the GCP and checked for leaks (nothing obvious as far as I can tell) and for blockages in the OPV tube (also nothing I can immediately see). 

Does anyone have an idea of what it could be? Or what I could check next?

Thursday, September 18th

-Arrived at SeaTac at 9:10 (early!)

-Ferry ride was BEAUTIFUL (definitely worth it!)

-Unloaded the ferry and headed Poulsbo 

-Souvinier shopping, pastries from Sluys, coffees from Hot Shots, and candy shopping at Mariana Market (MASSIVE selection of foreign candy and black licorice, super fun to try a bunch of new candies during our hikes!)

-Pictures by the falls, hiked about 8 miles and 3000 feet of elevation, sandwiches by Deer Lake for lunch, camped at Lunch Lake (beautiful spot!) 

Saturday, September 20th

-Woke up to the most peaceful sunrise ever

-Coffee, freeze dried biscuits and gravy, and chilling at camp

-We only had about 4 miles to hike today through the 7 Lakes Basin and across the High Divide

-Blue skies, no wind, and insane views (Mount Olympus was stunning) 

-Arrived to Heart Lake early, set up camp, made lunch, swam in the (icy) lake, read books, played yatzee, stared at the mountains, spotted 3 bears, 1 lone male elk, made dinner, went to bed as it started raining (it was an excellent mountain day!)


Sunday, September 21st 

-Woke up to rain drops on the tent still (we got dumped on pretty good, but stayed cozy in our tent. I was hoping the rain would help the Bear Gulch fire, but I don't think it made much of an impact)

-Once the rain stopped, I said good morning to our bears who were still munching their blueberries and spotted 2 more bears above Heart Lake

-Oatmeal and coffee for breakfast, packed up a very wet tent, hiked out

-Very wet and lush 9 miles today (moss was popping!) 

-Made it back to the Sol Duc trailhead by 1:30

-Changed and headed to the Sol Duc Hot Springs resort for a burger and a beer (ate overlooking the hot springs pool)

-Showered in the locker rooms and did the 4:00pm hot spring soak (I liked going between the hottest pool and cannonballing in the big pool-felt great on tired legs!)

-Back tracked slightly to Lake Crescent Lodge where we checked into a Singer Tavern Cottage for 2 nights (expensive but worth it for the charm and views! I also booked this in April!) 

-Grabbed at drink from the lobby bar and enjoyed it by the lake for Sunset

-We didn't have a reservation for the dinning room this night so we order the fish and chips and chowder to share from the bar, ate in the sun room 

-Back to our room for another coma like night of sleep


Monday, September 22nd 

-Slept in

-Coffee in my rocking chair on the porch staring at lake crescent 

- Ordered breakfast from the bar and ate in the sun room again (amazing views and vibes) 

- Drove the 15 minutes to Log Cabin Resort and rented e-bikes (more expensive than we thought but very beautiful and fun)

-Biked about 15 miles on the spruce railroad trail with stops to enjoy the lake views and snacks (the bikes were doing 90% of the work, I swear)

-Took turns watching the bikes so we could each walk to Devil's Punchbowl (pretty, but not mind-blowing in my opinion) 

-Returned bikes, drove back to Lake Crescent Lodge, had a picnic lunch on the porch 

-Hiked from the lodge to Marymere Falls (beautiful trail and destination!) 

-Tea and books in the rocking chairs (I paid a pretty penny to have a porch looking at lake crescent and I was getting my money's worth!)

-Pre dinner drinks in the lodge lobby and dinner in the dinning room (BF had the steak, I had a chicken Caesar salad, and we shared the clams-everything was super tasty!)


Tuesday, September 23rd

-One last coffee in the rocking chairs on the porch (I would absolutely live at the Lake Crescent Lodge if I could) 

-Drove toward Cape Flattery 

-Stopped at the Beaver Grocery store for a to-go breakfast burrito and some more snacks (the guy in there was so nice!) 

-Two one way sections on 112 for two road slides, we had to wait about 35 minutes total to get through-give yourself a little extra time 

-Stopped at the Mini Market in Neah Bay to go to the bathroom and buy the Makah Recreation Permit 

-Drove to Cape Flattery and did the hike- it was STUNNING on a blue sky day

-Back to Neah Bay for a visit to the Makah Museum (excellent) and lunch at Bigginz (great burger, super friendly) 

-Drove to the Shi Shi Beach overnight parking, put on our packs, and headed out for one night on Shi Shi 

-Hiked across lots of board walks, around LOTS of mud, and down the beach to Point of Arches

-Set up camp and headed for the tide pools and sea stacks (this was at about 6pm, low tide was .18 feet at 8:28pm) 

-Had the time of our lives exploring sea caves and watching crabs, hermit crabs, sea stars, and all kinds of critters while the sun was setting over the sea stacks 

-Made dinner on the beach in front of our campsite and watched truly the most beautiful sunset I've ever seen

Wednesday, September 24

-Breakfast and coffee on the beach watching the misty, moody Point of Arches 

-Back to the tide pools for the 8:20am low tide 

-Packed up and headed out, saw one seal near shore! 

-Stopped in Neah Bay at Native Grounds Espresso for some non-insant coffee and pastries 

-Shorter wait on 112 this day

-Head to Forks for lunch at Sully's (decent food, friendly service), souviner shopping, and grocery top off at Thriftway (loved this store-you can buy EVERYTHING here) 

-Drove out the Hoh Rainforest (no wait at 4:45pm) and grabbed a FCFS site at the campground 

-Hiked the Hall of Mosses trail (very quiet this time of day/year-at many points we couldn't see anyone else)
 
-Dinner at the campsite and enjoying the quiet of the Hoh 

-Woke up once in the night to the haunting sound of elk calling nearby (spooky but super cool!)


Thursday, September 25th
-Oatmeal and coffee at the campsite

-Packed up camp and headed to the 9:30am rainforest ranger talk with Ranger Abby (super informative and fun-highly recommend) 

-Hiked the Spruce Nature Trail (the visitor center and parking lot felt much busier this morning, but this trail still felt quiet)

-Headed out and watched a heard of elk from the car including one MASSIVE bull 

-Ruby beach for a picnic lunch (beautiful even at high tide!) 

-Short stops at Big Cedar Nature trail, the Tree of Life (we were more impressed with the huge drift wood than the tree), and the Kalaloch Lodge for a beer on the patio (lovely) 

-Drove down the the south shore of Lake Quinault and set up camp at Willaby Campground (a little hidden gem, best for tent campers and maybe camper vans) 

-Pit stop at the world's largest Sitka Spruce 

-Dinner at the Salmon House (highly recommend! cute, tasty, beautiful at sunset!) 

-We found the south shore of Lake Quinault very cute and charming 


Friday, September 26th

-Packed up camp for the last time!

-Drove to the Lake Quinault Lodge for the breakfast buffet (a little expensive, but the lodge and view is beautiful)

-Did the 4ish mile loop hike from the lodge, through the rainforest, and back along the lake (pretty and really peaceful) 

-Stopped for lunch at Lemon Hill Cafe & Bookstore in Montesano(food was sooo good and the women who worked there were so sweet, felt like Gilmore Girls)

-Continued on to Olympia and Seattle for a little city time

​I call myself the Existential Nomad because I've never found a home in any single idea. Home is a box, and ideology is too often a cage. I wander a beat of my own making, making my way through this alternate apocalyptic timeline with the help of copious amounts of cannabis.
​My Craft: Leftist Gonzo Journalism
​I don't pretend to be an objective observer—objectivity is the biggest lie the powerful ever sold the powerless. I am a participant.

​My Politics: Unapologetically Leftist
​Anti-corporate, anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist, and always Antifascist.
​I stand with the exploited against the exploiter, the marginalized against the machine.
​I am not a pacifist and will provide armed security for nonviolent participants, especially for BIPOC folx. My whiteness is a weapon for justice.
​But my core philosophy is that nothing is binary. I believe in revolution, but I also see the flaws in revolutionaries. I despise capitalism, but I understand the people trapped within it. I will fight fascists in the street and then write about the pathetic, terrified human being cowering behind the swastika.
​This is not a space for easy answers. It's a chronicle of the beautiful, absurd struggle.
​The Mythos: My ""Powers""
​My powers are not of the body, but of the mind and spirit.
​The Gaze of Absurdity: I can make eye contact and force a person to confront the crushing meaninglessness of their actions.
​Nomadic Intuition: I'm instinctively drawn to ""hotspots of despair"" or ""crises of meaning,"" appearing where hope is on the verge of collapse.
​Perspective Shift: My presence can subtly alter perceptions, fostering radical empathy and revealing new solutions.
​The Mythic Beard: More than hair, it's a conduit for absurd, mythic truths. It grants me a lumberjack’s skill with an axe, the strength to face a bear, and an impossible certainty in any contest. It's the raw, earthly proof that in this beautiful, absurd struggle, some things just are.

1nt565i,https://i.redd.it/m1n8jai190sf1.png,Deus ex Universum: A Theological Equation for Cosmic Affection,"**Abstract**  
We propose the following pantheistic axiom: **God ≡ Universe**. From this, we derive the statistically outrageous conclusion that the cosmos — cold, vast, and seemingly indifferent — is, in fact, madly in love with you. Via the Fine-Tuning Argument, the Fermi Paradox, and a dash of existential slapstick, we suggest that the Universe’s refusal to kill us (yet) is the clearest possible act of divine affection. A mathematical model of God's love, defined in terms of the limit ε → 0.999… approaching ∞, is appended for those who like their theology in latex.

# 1. Introduction: The Universe’s Midlife Crisis

Let’s accept, without coffee and with considerable irony, the axiom:

>

This does not require belief in robes or burning bushes — just a willingness to squint at entropy and call it foreplay. If this is true, then the Universe is either:

* A disinterested parent,
* A misunderstood artist,
* Or an advanced intelligence with a wicked sense of humor and a soft spot for dramatic carbon.

As of 2025, humanity is the only confirmed case of sentient life. Which makes us either:

* A cosmic miracle, or
* A really expensive typo.

SETI is dead (RIP, 1984–2020). The Copernican principle says we’re not special. But statistics say: *hold on*. This kind of persistent life is suspicious. We’re still here — warm-blooded, meme-making, apocalypse-dodging — on a rock that rotates like a cosmic fidget spinner.

**Conclusion:**  
God (aka The Universe) loves us. Quietly. Statistically. Weirdly.

>

# 2. Core Thesis: GOD’s Algorithmic Benevolence

Let’s get nerdy. The Universe is **absurdly fine-tuned**:

* Cosmological constant: precise to 1 in 10\^120
* Gravity: 10\^-39 off from chaos
* Earth: 1 AU from a yellow star, dodging supernovae like it's in a galactic stealth mode

Possible explanations:

* **A)** Divine calibration with a fetish for symmetry
* **B)** Infinite multiverse where we just got lucky
* **C)** We’re inside someone’s science fair project

Occam’s Razor prefers A. Mostly because B feels like philosophical insurance fraud.

Also, let’s face it: we anthropomorphize **everything**. Dogs, clouds, spreadsheets. Of course we gave the void a beard and blamed it for hurricanes.

>

# 3. Supporting Arguments

# 3.1 The Fermi Paradox as Divine Irony

The silence is deafening. Options:

* We’re first
* We’re last
* We’re under cosmic quarantine

If GOD = UNIVERSE, then the Fermi Paradox becomes a loving act of solitude. Like a galactic “Do Not Disturb” sign taped gently on our sector — lest some Type III civilization drop by and judge our reality shows.

>

# 3.2 The “Oh-So-Damn-Close-to-Dying” Principle

Let’s review:

* 4.5 billion years of asteroid dodgeball
* Five extinction-level events
* 2020–2025 (no elaboration needed)

Somehow, we're still here — talking about it.

Possibilities:

* Luck
* Simulation
* Divine save-point mechanic

We propose a hybrid: **The Save Game Theory of God** — a built-in rollback function in spacetime.

>

# 4. Counterarguments (Preemptively Deflated)

# 4.1 The Problem of Suffering

If God loves us, why pandemics? Or mayonnaise?

Answer: Non-interventionist affection. God is more therapist than helicopter parent. A nebular hug. No micromanagement.

# 4.2 Jesus vs. The Universe

Christ: top-tier moral system  
The Universe: doesn’t do parables

Still — it gave us 13.8 billion years of hydrogen doing spoken-word poetry until it accidentally became Beethoven.

>

# 5. Synthesis Suggestions

* **Mathematize Divine Love:** Let **D = ∫(complexity × rarity × survival odds) dt** Solve for D ≈ ∞
* **Retcon Theology:** Canonize the James Webb Space Telescope as a minor prophet
* **Ethical Calculus:** If GOD ≡ UNIVERSE, then:
   * Carbon offsets = tithes
   * Recycling = repentance
   * Compost = sacred rite

# 6. Conclusion: Q.E.D. = Quietly Eternally Divine

The silence of the void is not indifference — it’s consent. By not stopping us, not interfering, not pressing “undo,” the Universe does something holy: *it lets us be*.

That, perhaps, is the truest kind of love. One that says:

>

This realization is either comforting or terrifying. Possibly both. But either way:

1nt55t9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodContent/comments/1nt55t9/recyclable_stand_up_pouches_a_smart_and/,Recyclable Stand Up Pouches: A Smart and Sustainable Packaging Choice,"In today’s consumer-driven world, packaging is more than just a container for products—it’s an essential part of branding, logistics, and customer experience. As environmental awareness grows, companies are under increasing pressure to shift from traditional packaging toward more sustainable alternatives. One of the most innovative solutions emerging in the packaging industry is the [**recyclable stand up pouch**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-standard-bag-style/stand-up-bag). Known for its convenience, durability, and eco-friendly features, this packaging format has gained popularity across industries such as food, beverages, cosmetics, and household goods. By adopting recyclable stand up pouches, businesses can meet consumer demand for sustainability while maintaining product protection and visual appeal.

The design of a stand up pouch makes it one of the most practical packaging formats available today. Unlike rigid containers, stand up pouches use flexible materials that expand at the bottom, allowing the pouch to stand upright on shelves. This feature not only enhances product visibility but also ensures stability during storage and transport. When made from recyclable films, these pouches reduce environmental impact while maintaining all the functional benefits. Customizable features like resealable zippers, spouts, and tear notches further improve usability, ensuring consumers can conveniently open, close, and store products. Whether used for coffee, snacks, pet food, or cleaning supplies, recyclable stand up pouches deliver both practicality and sustainability.

From a branding perspective, recyclable stand up pouches are highly advantageous. Their broad surface area provides ample space for vibrant, high-quality graphics and detailed product information. Companies can highlight eco-friendly messages, certifications, and branding elements that appeal to environmentally conscious shoppers. With advanced printing technologies such as digital and rotogravure printing, brands can create eye-catching designs that reflect their identity and values. Additionally, the transparency option allows businesses to add clear windows, giving consumers a view of the product inside and building trust in product quality. In competitive retail spaces, packaging plays a vital role in influencing purchase decisions, and recyclable stand up pouches provide the perfect balance of sustainability and visual appeal.

From a logistical and economic standpoint, recyclable stand up pouches offer several benefits compared to traditional rigid packaging. Because they are lightweight and can be shipped flat before filling, they significantly reduce transportation and storage costs. Their compact design means more units can be packed per shipment, leading to lower carbon emissions and improved efficiency in the supply chain. Despite their lightweight nature, recyclable stand up pouches are engineered to provide excellent barrier protection against moisture, air, and light, keeping products fresh and extending shelf life. For industries like food and beverage, where quality preservation is critical, this combination of durability and eco-friendliness makes the pouch a standout choice.

Ultimately, the shift toward recyclable stand up pouches represents more than just a packaging trend—it reflects a broader global movement toward sustainability and responsible consumption. Consumers are increasingly choosing brands that demonstrate environmental responsibility, and packaging is one of the most visible ways to communicate those values. By adopting recyclable pouches, businesses can reduce waste, lower carbon footprints, and align themselves with eco-conscious market trends. At the same time, they gain access to a versatile, cost-effective, and visually striking packaging solution that enhances both branding and functionality. In the years ahead, recyclable stand up pouches are expected to become a standard in multiple industries, symbolizing a step toward a cleaner planet and a stronger connection between businesses and their environmentally aware customers.",1,1759108591.0,GoodContent,0,1.0,False

I usually keep my room at 65 degrees if not a little lower and i don't drink anything caffeinated after my morning cup of coffee. I have been trying to fix my sleep schedule because I've been going to bed at 3am, however I've only been bringing it back to my desired sleeping time by 30 minutes a day. when I've done this in the past I've been able to bring it back 1 hour a day with little to no issue. For the past year I've been using trazadone to help me sleep because about a year ago my sleep schedule became so erratic from school that I just could not fall asleep, when i started taking it, it was the only thing that would put me to sleep regardless of the circumstances. However it seems i still need it a lot of days even though my sleep schedule is mostly consistent albeit late. even though I've been taking it, for the past few days it I still have a very difficult time falling asleep and I don't understand why, espaccaly since it has nocked me out into slumber in the past. Ill give a description of what i do to fall asleep each night



a few hours before bedtime ill set the thermostat to 65ish

60-70 minutes before I want to fall asleep i get my bed ready and brush my teeth

50-60 minutes before I want to fall asleep I go to bed and listen to white noise and void myself of blue light

30 minutes before I want to fall asleep I take the trazadone, reset the white noise on my phone or switch to a longer white noise video.

1nt55kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/1nt55kl/thankyou_and_my_personal_pca_story_so_far_as/,"Thank-you, and my personal PCa story so far (AS)","63 yr old British expat here living in NJ. I wanted to share my journey to-date since everyone’s situation is slightly different and making a treatment decision is very, very personal to your own circumstances.  Maybe my journey will resonate with someone and I hope it will help in some way. This is my small way of paying back to this community. I have been lurking & using this subreddit as one of many resources since the first signs of potential PCa became apparent after my “annual” physical in Sep. ‘24. PSA was elevated.

*1st lesson*: At the very least have a PSA test on your health record every year after \~50 years old.

I have NOT been a regular visitor to the doctor’s office - I go only as necessary - hence “annual” above - I haven’t felt the need to go to the doctor for every sniffle, or high temperature, or even an annual physical - and so I had no regular PSA results to compare (previous one was maybe 2-3 years ago). 

After seeing my blood test results my PCP referred me to a urologist to discuss an elevated PSA, but I was unable to see him until Thanksgiving week last year (Nov. ‘24), and after a DRE he recommended an MRI, the results of which were:

MRI (Dec. 31, ‘24) PIRADS: 5

PSA: 13.68ng/ml; 

PSA Density: 0.33 ng/ml2

Prostate Volume: 42.03cc 

Prostate Dimensions: 4.8 x 3.8 x 4.7 cm

At my follow-up appt. at the end of January my urologist recommended & scheduled me for a biopsy - the earliest appt - Mar. 28, ‘25. The biopsy confirmed the presence of cancer cells & assigned a Gleason: 3+3 Grade Group: 1 (18% of tissue core, and tumor length approx 5mm).

Following that I had PSMA PET CT scan (May 1, ‘25) which thankfully confirmed NO SPREAD outside of the prostate.

I met with a medical oncologist, a radiation oncologist in addition to my urologist to understand my treatment options from their perspectives.

During this whole period I was also researching this subreddit, watching [PCRI videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePCRI), reading material from [PCF](https://www.pcf.org/), subscribed to [Howard Wolinsky’s substack](https://howardwolinsky.substack.com/) on Active Surveillance, I read (actually listened to) [You Can Beat Prostate Cancer (And You Don’t need Surgery To Do it) by Robert J Marckini ](https://www.amazon.com/You-Can-Beat-Prostate-Cancer/dp/061514022X)\- **I can’t recommend this book highly enough** for the information it contains and the way it is presented - in a simple relatable & understandable way. If you are on this journey and you take nothing else away from my post - read this book.

*2nd Lesson:* Get a 2nd opinion.

One of the recurring themes I was picking up from my research was to get a 2nd opinion, and if possible, from a nationally recognised Cancer Center of Excellence. I am fortunate enough to have one relatively close by at RWJBarnabas (Rutgers Cancer Institute) in NJ.

I made a series of appts. there with a urologic surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist. My Gleason score alone was leading me towards a preference for Active Surveillance, but my decision was complicated by seemingly contradictory evidence with an elevated PSA & the MRI PIRADS 5 designation.

The surgeon at the cancer center suggested he submit a sample of my biopsy tissue for a [Decipher test](https://decipherbio.com/decipher-prostate/patients/decipher-prostate-overview/) to help us decide on a recommended course of action.

That result (Jul. 8, ‘25) came back as LOW RISK (0.23 on a scale of 0-1.0)

In my follow-up appt. at the cancer center a week or so later, the urologic surgeon agreed that he was comfortable with an initial period of Active Surveillance and scheduled my next MRI for 6 months in Dec. this year - one year after the last MRI, and he also scheduled another biopsy for Dec/Jan.

So that’s where I am now. I feel relieved that I have a period of respite from worrying about making a treatment decision, and can only hope that my next round of tests support continuation with AS.

In the meantime I have made some lifestyle changes, again based on much of the research that I have done, and in a delayed response to my PCPs recommendation (2 years ago) that I reduce my weight.

Confirmation of my diagnosis at the end of April this year was the motivation I needed to make a serious attempt to lose weight ( 225lbs at that time). Below are the changes that ***I*** made - and I feel I should emphasise that everyone needs to make decisions that work for them, so I am not suggesting that this is what everyone should do, or that this will work for anyone, just offering this as my experience. Since May I am down 40lbs to 185lbs.

* I have a desk job, so not much exercise during the day, so I decided to incorporate regular walking into my daily routine.  I started with a goal of 6K steps daily (side note: the recommended 10K steps often touted, is an arbitrary # with no supporting evidence that it is optimal). I have since raised it to 7K, and regularly actually do 8K.
   * I work on the 4th floor of an office building, so I take the stairs up & down; when I take bathroom breaks I take the stairs down to the ground floor restrooms.
   * I walk around the office campus at lunchtime to get some additional exercise & Vitamin D!
   * I also recently bought a walking pad for home, so that I can walk while watching TV ( I spend way too much time watching soccer \[English Premier League\] from my couch on the weekends). This way I can walk and watch!
* The next step for me is to get into a better regular habit of weight/resistance training in the gym to build a little more muscle, I haven’t been able to fully incorporate it into my routine yet.
* In the past I have dabbled with [ Intermittent Fasting (If)](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/3e4f89b2-3f46-11f0-9557-711fbcc2b0f6) and have embraced that again. I stopped snacking in the evenings and once I have had my evening meal, I don’t eat again until at least midday next day. 
* I adjusted my sleep habits to get 7 hours of per night instead of the 4-5 hrs on which I had been surviving.
* Change by diet to eat healthier:
   * Reduced bread intake to zero
   * Reduced sugar intake (subbed Stevia recently in tea)
   * Avoiding processed foods
   * I mainly eat chicken or salmon with the occasional steak
   * Stopped eating chips, chocolate, cakes & cookies (the hardest!)
   * Eating fruit regularly - oranges, mandarin oranges, grapefruit, berries (and kale) in smoothies
   * Cruciferous vegetables with every meal instead of rice or potatoes
   * Vitamin D supplement daily, Apple Cider Vinegar capsules, Multi-vitamin.
   * Drinking more water
   * I still drink coffee in the morning once at work, and in the afternoon & evenings I drink Green tea (w/ pomegranate or mint)
   * Many of the diet changes I have made were inspired by “[Metabolic Freedom” by Ben Azadi](https://a.co/d/3tu44R6)
* Everything in moderation, so I haven’t completely given up all treats! When I reach a weight loss milestone I have treated myself to a meal that I used to enjoy (generally a good Indian Curry, and an occasional ice cream bar). 

So, that’s it - my story so far.

Thank-you to everyone in this community that has shared their experiences - I take something from each of them.. I am sure there are many others like me (lurkers) looking for information but not yet comfortable in contributing to this extremely supportive forum. Whatever your situation, and wherever you are in your journey, I wish you luck.

1nt51ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1nt51ob/it_is_difficult_being_a_naturally_deep_thinker/,It is difficult being a naturally deep thinker.,"I’ve always been a “deep thinker.” Often, I feel as if my representation I give can be seen as intimidating or pretentious. I often leap into a depth of my own person immediately in a conversation. It’s a type of reciprocity I long for, to be heard fully, yet often I feel as if I have to micromanage my phrasings and words so someone has an easier way in.

I don’t believe this is a bad thing, per se. It’s just an adjustment I’m getting used to as I’m getting older. Before, I’d have people just listen to me and whatever obsession I was within. Now, when I read Schopenhauer, a sutra, and Ulysses at a coffee shop, I automatically alienate myself by my own representation. It is not to say I will stop doing this to hide who I am. But it is to say I long for someone to walk in with their own copy of Kant, the Mahabharata, and Gravity’s Rainbow.

To be a mirror to people, which I believe is the natural state of a mind, is debilitating if you do not manage the identity of your own person. To have your identity, you must attach to what makes this identity, which is your hair, your clothes, your jewelry, your voice, and so forth. Once tailored, your representation can be seen, if that isn’t obvious. But if you are constantly a mirror within your own head, you also lose a part, or the whole, of that identity for a brief period.

It’s called “adaptability.” That’s the word I struggle with most. It feels as if when I adapt myself to someone, I lose who I am for a second. The mirror is shining bright, yet the depth of the refractions is not seen yet. I jump immediately into a conclusive “this is me” attitude instead, yet people do not want to hear how they are the subject and I am the object or how matter is the composite of time and space interacting with a collective, dreamlike perception… or whatever I’m thinking about next.

Does anyone else have a similar struggle with holding depth and often feeling it is not reciprocated in the way you want? I know what I need to do, yknow. Grow up. Buckle down and adapt to people, be mature. But sometimes, I still do wish to immediately start off a conversation with, “hey, want to talk about how I’ve fucked up following the Five Precepts?”

Overeaters Anonymous is a Fellowship of individuals who, through shared experience, strength, and hope, are recovering from compulsive overeating. We welcome everyone who wants to stop eating compulsively. There are no dues or fees for members; we are self-supporting through our own contributions, neither soliciting nor accepting outside donations. OA is not affiliated with any public or private organization, political movement, ideology, or religious doctrine; we take no position on outside issues. Our primary purpose is to abstain from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors and to carry the message of recovery through the Twelve Steps of OA to those who still suffer.

Our Invitation to You (https://oa.org/app/uploads/2021/05/our-invitation-to-you.pdf)

The Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous (https://oa.org/newcomers/how-do-i-start/program-basics/twelve-traditions/)

Abstinence in Overeaters Anonymous is the action of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight. Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is the result of living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step program.

The OA tools of recovery help us work the Steps and refrain from compulsive overeating. The nine tools are: a plan of eating, sponsorship, meetings, telephone, writing, literature, an action plan, anonymity, and service. For more information, read The Tools of Recovery OA page (https://oa.org/newcomers/how-do-i-start/program-basics/tools-of-recovery/).

Sponsorship is one of our keys to success. Sponsors are OA members committed to abstinence and to living the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions to the best of their ability. Sponsors share their program up to the level of their experience and strengthen their recovery through this service to others. To find a sponsor, look for someone who has what you want and ask how he or she is achieving it. 

Will all abstinent sponsors please identify themselves in their post?

According to our Seventh Tradition, we are self-supporting through our own contributions. Our group number is 99038. Please use the group number when making your contribution. As our virtual group currently has no expenses please consider donating directly through this link (https://oa.org/contribute/) to the OA World Service Office, who provides resources for OA groups all around the world to carry the message to other compulsive overeaters.

Suggested guidelines for sharing: As you share your experience and strength in OA, please also share your hope. Please confine your sharing to your experience with the disease of compulsive eating, the solution offered by OA, and your own recovery from the disease, rather than just the events of the day or week. When responding to other member’s posts, please focus on your personal experience rather than advice giving. If you are having difficulties, share how you use the program to deal with them. If you need to talk more about your difficulties and seek solutions, we suggest you speak to your sponsor and other members after the meeting.

This is a literature meeting. Today we are studying the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous page 135

Whether the family goes on a spiritual basis or not, the alcoholic member has to if he would recover. The others must be convinced of his new status beyond the shadow of a doubt. Seeing is believing to most families who have lived with a drinker.

Here is a case in point: One of our friends is a heavy smoker and coffee drinker. There was no doubt he over-indulged. Seeing this, and meaning to be help-ful, his wife commenced to admonish him about it. He admitted he was overdoing these things, but frankly said that he was not ready to stop. His wife is one of those persons who really feels there is something rather sinful about these commodities, so she nagged, and her intolerance finally threw him into a fit of anger. He got drunk.

Of course our friend was wrong-dead wrong. He had to painfully admit that and mend his spiritual fences. Though he is now a most effective member of Alcoholics Anonymous, he still smokes and drinks coffee, but neither his wife nor anyone else stands in judgment. She sees she was wrong to make a burning issue out of such a matter when his more serious ailments were being rapidly cured.
We have three little mottoes which are apropos.
Here they are:
First Things First Live and Let Live
Easy Does It.


**Closing:** By following the Twelve Steps, attending meetings regularly, and using the OA Tools, we are changing our lives. You will find hope and encouragement in Overeaters Anonymous. To the newcomer, we suggest attending at least six different meetings to learn the many ways OA can help you. The opinions expressed here today are those of individual OA members and do not represent OA as a whole. Let us all reach out by private message to newcomers, returning members, and each other. Together we get better.

I want to say that y'all have been golden for me and my pups. Thank you for all the info on licking his paw. I think he is past it now.

I need help figuring out how to get my pups to eat kibble as my veterinarian has recommended this for the reasons I will explain the story below (for those who want to know and to give more context). Our dogs have always eaten food prepared by us and I did try to give them kibble once before but they weren't having. Admittedly we have spoiled them. Now it's time to face the music. 

Who has done this and what worked for you and your dog? All advice is appreciated!  
Thank you! 

(STORY BELOW FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED)

So the day I asked about my dog licking his paw we had a bigger and more serious issue. That night when it was time to go to bed, Brutus would not get down from his chair and follow me to the bedroom like he normally does. Normally he just jumps down and follows along. At first I thought he was just waking up so I put away my work materials and went back to get him. He still would not get off the chair and just sat there with his head swaying back and forth like he was drunk. Ok that was weird. 

I helped him down from the chair and he peed on the floor while I was holding him and he was acting weird. He was walking slow, wouldn't follow and went under the stairs instead of following me and Coco upstairs. I thought immediately this isn't right and started thinking what could have happened? Maybe he was bit by a spider as we were sitting out in the garden. Then I remembered that I had fed him a piece of cheese and later saw that there was some mold on the cheese. He did not eat a lot but he is not a big dog (18 lbs).   
  
I called my wife in the middle of all of this as she was at a conference and showed her Brutus on the video and she thought he was acting weird. During parts of this discussion he seemed to be doing better so I started thinking I will just wait until tomorrow and see how he is. When I was about to hang up, he almost fell over and seemed really off, so I said to hell with this! I'm taking my boy to the vet.

Well we just moved to a new city in the south of Mexico and we do not know any vets yet or even know if they have 24 hour vet services! So I got on my phone and fortunately the first one that came up was  24 hour vet with a 4.9 star rating (out of 5) so I said thats our boy! But I looked at the map an it was in a part of town that I am not familiar with yet. So I called an uber. They dont have Uber pet so I have to explain to the driver once he accepts my request that I have dogs with me and I told him it was ""una urgencia"" and he said, I will be right there! (This was all going on in Spanish! My Spanish is not perfect.) These people are so nice there. 

So we go to where the vet is supposed to be but they use WAZE and so of course we don't get the location right. But my driver starts asking people on the street where this clinic is and we finally find it but the Vet is not in. So my driver (this dude was AWESOME) starts asking the neighbors for his phone number and someone gives it to him. WOW! He calls the Vet and the vet arrives in like 15 minutes. 

He looks Brutus over and he has a temperature (103) and he thinks it is an infection. He thinks it is a kidney infection and starts giving him medicine to bring down the fever. We wait a bit and the temperature goes up to like 110! I am freaking out thinking my boy is going to die right there. But the doctor keep working . He tells me I probably need to leave him for the night. I'm like NO WAY! I'm staying right here! So I get to sit in the benches outside and hold my little Brutus until his fever goes down and the vet lets us go. 

But get this, the vet calls my uber driver to come back and get me at like 1:00 am, and HE DOES! I'm telling you these people are the best! We went home. I got his medicines and we are on the road to recovery! Which is why I need to learn about feeding him kibble. 

ONE LAST PART TO THIS STORY FOR PEOPLE WITH NOTHING BETTER TO DO!  
So the next morning, I get up (I was checking on Brutus throughout the night and let him sleep on the bed next to me.) and Brutus is feeling better. I go downstairs, make the coffee, feed the dogs and start working when I realize I do not have my wallet. I'm like oh shit! Where is my wallet. I NEVER lose things, especially my wallet. But I was tired when we got home and who knows what happened. But I do remember that I had it to pay the driver in cash last night for the second part of the trip home. So I know it is either in his car or it fell off my lap when I was getting the dogs out of the car. I went outside, nothing on the curb or street or in my front yard, so I wait anxiously to call the Uber driver because I know he worked all night. (He gave me his number when he dropped us off.) So I send him a message. Later in the day he texts me and says he will look for it when he goes to work but he had other clients after me. This guy could have said anything. He could have said, I think someone took it. I did not find it, you must have lost it somewhere else. But when he texts me back. He says, I have your wallet. It was under the seat. I will drop it off when I go to work. WOW! WOW! And he did! Of course I rewarded him dearly as the money in my wallet was the least of my concerns. I am telling you. The Mexican people are incredibly kind. Overall, I had a very lucky experience. 

So I hope you enjoyed the story and if not, why did you read this far!?? Ha ha! Have a great one everyone and hopefully your days should be so lucky! ",3,1759108095.0,poodles,1,0.81,False

​I call myself the Existential Nomad because I've never found a home in any single idea. Home is a box, and ideology is too often a cage. I wander a beat of my own making, making my way through this alternate apocalyptic timeline with the help of copious amounts of cannabis.


​My Craft: Leftist Gonzo Journalism
​I don't pretend to be an objective observer—objectivity is the biggest lie the powerful ever sold the powerless. I am a participant. My notebook is stained with the coffee of late-night strategy sessions and the visceral residue of tear gas. I write what I see, what I feel, and what the ghosts of history whisper.


​My Politics: Unapologetically Leftist
​Anti-corporate, anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist, and always Antifascist.
​I stand with the exploited against the exploiter, the marginalized against the machine.
​I am not a pacifist and will provide armed security for nonviolent participants, especially for BIPOC folx. My whiteness is a weapon for justice.


​But my core philosophy is that nothing is binary. I believe in revolution, but I also see the flaws in revolutionaries. I despise capitalism, but I understand the people trapped within it. I will fight fascists in the street and then write about the pathetic, terrified human being cowering behind the swastika.


​This is not a space for easy answers. It's a chronicle of the beautiful, absurd struggle.
​The Mythos: My ""Powers""
​My powers are not of the body, but of the mind and spirit.

​The Gaze of Absurdity: I can make eye contact and force a person to confront the crushing meaninglessness of their actions.
​Nomadic Intuition: I'm instinctively drawn to ""hotspots of despair"" or ""crises of meaning,"" appearing where hope is on the verge of collapse.

​Perspective Shift: My presence can subtly alter perceptions, fostering radical empathy and revealing new solutions.

​The Mythic Beard: More than hair, it's a conduit for absurd, mythic truths. It grants me a lumberjack’s skill with an axe, the strength to face a bear, and an impossible certainty in any contest. It's the raw, earthly proof that in this beautiful, absurd struggle, some things just are.

​This is a search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, one story at a time.

​Welcome to the trip. 

Don't expect a map.

Do some of these cancel each other out if taken at the same? Or with certain foods? I take heme iron  mid-morning with vitamin C so it's a few hours after the milk in my coffee (and yes I know that with heme iron it's not supposed to matter but I do ot anyway). 

I take Vitamin D 2,000 IU in the p.m., riboflavin (B2) 100 mg in the p.m,, magnesium glycinate 120mg, a.m. and p.m.,  and CoQ10 120 mg in the p.m. 

I take a few other supplements as well .... any that counteract the most important ones for me - my VM supplements? ",1,1759107787.0,VestibularMigraines,0,1.0,False

It had that coffee fruit taste that you expect from coffee, very little bitterness for a Full City+ roast, and this blank undeveloped natural sweetness. It tastes good enough that I could see myself doing it on purpose on a regular basis, and I'm wondering if anyone else does this?

I will be doing it with every coffee I roast for the next little while to see what I notice, but I figure there will be less differentiation between beans, because the components don't have any time to develop into more complex flavors. Usually I do a double-bloom French press to test a fresh roast, but this time I got experimental.",1,1759107736.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I would have given my all for you.
I would have found strength and confidence to build on myself and easily improve as a person.
I would have learned how you felt most loved and respected and what made you happy, and done the world to bring that to you as much as humanly possible.
I would have stuck with you through sickness and good health.
I would have cherished the small moments, the music we listened to together.
I would have been drunk off the smell of your skin, over and over and over again.
I would have given you massages.
I would have traveled the world with you.
I would have created and collaborated with you, and supported you through your work and passion.
I would have done everything I could to make your life enjoyable.
I would have held your hand on more coffee dates.
I would have raised a dog with you.
I would have helped you clean up after parties.
I would have cooked you breakfast and dinner.
I would have seen if you wanted anything from the store before I got home.
I would have shared a home with you, and a bed.
I would have loved you to the end, but you didn’t want any of that.

You rejected me.
You rejected all of me.
You simply didn’t feel the way I do, and that’s okay, but I’m just here with all of this now and I’m sad. I’m so sad. I’m jaded. Nothing interests me. Nothing excites me. Nothing gets me right in the jeans.

I miss you like crazy.
I’ll never do anything weird, but it’s just sad that all I have left are thoughts of you saying the same dismissive abusive stuff you said towards the end.
All I have left is reminders that when I pass by your house (we’re nearly neighbors) that I’m a stranger to you, an enemy, a villain. Somebody you hate and want nothing to do with.

The reality is, you were a serial dater and I had no clue. An avoidant, and I had no idea about attachment styles. Bipolar, and I had no idea our chemistry was just you being hypersexual and getting your next fix. Somebody who lacks empathy, maturity, kindness, insight, and accountability. Somebody who would abuse, gaslight, lie, manipulate, dismiss, destroy.

If you were real, I would be vibrant and prideful, in love and delighted with life, and so would you.

But you’re not.

And now I’ve got to hope that I can meet somebody soon, because otherwise, it’s just… more of this feeling, which is a truly miserable way to experience life.

My love of low carb cookies is no secret, and these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks are right up there with the best of them! Primarily because they are no-bake, and therefore ready to eat in as little as five minutes! Also, they are intensely chocolatey, chewy and creamy at the same time, and they fall into the fat bomb category, so you can eat them anytime and not even feel bad about it! #allthewinning ? This Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks recipe was born of my desperate desire for something sweet and chocolatey RIGHT NOW, coupled with my being too lazy and impatient to want to actually bake something - or wait for said something to be ready to eat.  This pretty much describes my low carb life  you can relate, then this is your low carb cookie recipe my friends.  #lazyketochocolateloversunite The shredded coconut in these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks makes them chewy and cookie-like, and the nuts add a pleasant crunch and earthy flavor.  If you are allergic to nuts then you can certainly omit them, or if you have a specific nut preference, you can sub in your nut of  you're a fan of fruit and nut bars, you can throw in a couple of dried cranberries or cherries (or ewww, raisins) into these keto cookies, but be mindful of the extra carbs if you do.  Mr. Hungry and I have been grabbing one of these no bake keto fudge haystack cookies for breakfast along with our coffee on busy mornings, and I've found that it easily keeps me satisfied until lunchtime! They make a great after dinner treat too - or pretty much whenever you want a blissful few bites of creamy chocolate goodness!

My handy dandy cookie dough scooper is in storage in New Jersey right now, so I just used two spoons to form my keto haystack cookies.  It's much easier and faster if you do have a scoop though, so I'll be bringing one back on my next trip to the States! These Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystack Cookies are everything you want in a low carb chocolate cookie fix! Quick, easy, delicious, creamy AND crunchy, and they've got that sweet / salty thing going on if you like that sort of thing! Which I do.  A 't wait for you to make these and hit me with your feedback in the comments!
