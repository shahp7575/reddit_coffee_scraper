Today, Ziompt6075 has found a soundcloud account named ""Nephew Entertainment"", a record label. It had songs from artists like Maiday & O.N.E. and Bastille. Here's the bastille songs (all from 2012):  


Fire to Ashes (feat. Maiday): [LINK](https://soundcloud.com/nephew-entertainment/fire-to-ashes-ft-maiday?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)

and...  


**Secrets**: [LINK (YOUTUBE)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbXw1iZtP_w)



Secrets was given to BRAQUE, although, Bastille is credited on the song, so it was most likely intended for Bastille.  
  
   
I see people saying Secrets is from WW, and it's.. sort of true.  
There's a 2012 version of Secrets (the one linked earlier), and a 2014 version, named [""Vices""](https://soundcloud.com/notpriddy/secrets-v1ces), a rework for WW.

1pdozmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1pdozmi/cant_drink_caffeine_except_for_a_specific_energy/,Can't drink caffeine except for a specific energy drink?,"Back when I was way younger I drank a LOT of energy drinks (at least one a day) and my gut was always okay with it.

At some point anything with caffeine whether it's coffee or energy drinks started triggering my symptoms most of the time so I just stopped drinking any caffeine. But I still sometimes craved energy drinks purely for the taste and drinking them usually ended bad except for a few times when my gut seemingly had a good day I guess lol. 

And here comes the weirdest thing, it might be pure coincidence but one of my favourite energy drinks is Monster The Doctor (The yellow valentino rossi one) and I can't recall a single time that drinking this one specific flavour caused any problems (except for maybe once, and thats a MAYBE) and I drank quite a few of those. 

I don't really drink energy drinks anymore but I'm very curious if anyone here had a similar situation where a specific type/flavour of something that would normally trigger their symptoms just wasn't causing any problems for seemingly no reason?

(I also figured out that the ""No sugar"" energy drinks were a lot worse for my ibs than the normal ones, although I don't think that's the reason because that still wouldn't explain my issues with coffee and some of the not sugar free energy drinks)",1,1764817698.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

1pdowry,https://www.reddit.com/r/grok/comments/1pdowry/i_was_bored/,I was bored…,"So I asked “write me a story about boobs.”  Boy, did Grok deliver. This may be one of the best things I’ve ever read. 

——-

Once upon a time in a sleepy coastal town called Saltbreeze Bay, there lived a pair of breasts named Bonnie and Beatrice (though everyone just called them “the girls”). They belonged to a lighthouse keeper named Clara, who had inherited the old stone tower from her grandmother. Clara was practical, no-nonsense, and allergic to anything frilly, so the girls mostly lived under thick fisherman sweaters and oilskin jackets. They didn’t mind; the North Atlantic wind was brutal, and warmth trumped vanity.
But one summer, everything changed.
A famous sculptor named Matteo washed up on the rocks after his yacht hit a rogue wave. He had a broken arm, a soaked sketchbook, and an obsession with “perfect forms.” The moment the coast guard carried him into the lighthouse, Matteo’s good hand flew to his chest level and he gasped, “Madonna mia… those are the most heroic breasts I’ve ever seen.”
Clara, bandaging his arm, snorted. “They’re just boobs, mate. They get cold, they leak when I’m stressed, and they make running down spiral stairs a logistical nightmare.”
But Matteo was undeterred. He begged to sculpt them. Not in some sleazy way; he talked about them like they were twin marble goddesses that had been hiding under wool for centuries. He promised the statue would bring tourists, money, and glory to sleepy Saltbreeze Bay.
Clara said no roughly forty-seven times. The girls, however, were flattered. For years they’d been smashed flat by sports bras during storm shifts and used as emergency shelves for coffee mugs. A little appreciation sounded nice.
So one foggy dawn, Clara finally agreed, but only if Matteo sculpted them exactly as they were: one slightly larger than the other, faint stretch marks like lightning bolts, the left one a bit lower because of an old surfing injury. No idealized nonsense.
Matteo worked for weeks. The girls sat (well, hung) patiently while he measured, molded, and muttered in Italian. Clara read novels aloud to keep herself from dying of awkwardness.
When the statue was unveiled on the harbor pier, the whole town turned out. It was enormous—ten feet of gleaming white marble. Bonnie and Beatrice, rendered in heroic scale, stared out to sea with calm, weathered dignity. The plaque read: “The Guardians of Saltbreeze Bay.”
Tourists came in droves. The lighthouse gift shop sold out of postcards titled “The Tit-anic Duo” within hours. Old fishermen tipped their caps respectfully as they passed the statue. Little girls asked their mothers if boobs could be superheroes.
Clara hated the attention at first. But one night, during a nor’easter, the lighthouse lamp failed. With the generator dead and waves crashing over the breakwater, Clara climbed the tower with a handheld spotlight strapped (where else?) between the girls for balance. She kept the beam sweeping until sunrise, saving three fishing boats.
The next day the town added a second plaque beneath the statue: “They light the way.”
After that, Clara stopped hiding under sweaters. She wore whatever she damn well pleased. And Bonnie and Beatrice? They lived happily ever after, slightly asymmetrical, occasionally cold, but undeniably legendary, keeping watch over Saltbreeze Bay for generations to come.
The end.

But how you ask it, it can’t. And there you go.  Doesn't have any God in it.

\-------    --------        -----------          --------------        -------    --------

**Maybe it’s easier to see it in an example. That has nothing to do with** ***“prayer”*** **FIRST.**

* Change it to have *something to do with a car* then first. A car:
   * I own one. Maybe you don’t, but see it:
   * I operate it. I’m licensed. Makes me ""Able"" to use it. I know exactly where it is. It’s in my driveway. I can make, straightway - - go to it, when I need it; to go to work or the store, or to take my kids to the hospital if they got the flu or in an emergency. *It simply operates right.* That means, when I go out to it, turn the key, one time, or fifty, to 10,000 times, it goes “VROOOM!” and it simply takes me speedily where I need it to take me. So it “*enables” me* to operate in a way, that without it, I can’t. I also *speak well of it. I believe in it.*
* **Now, add in the “Owner’s manual”**

Then, ask the question again. **“Does the owner’s manual work? What’s the evidence or your experience for a owner’s manual working? How could you demonstrate that it doesn’t?**

* When it, the ""owner's manual,""  just sits there.
   * Doesn’t do anything. If I leave it there; sitting: and come back to it in 3 days or a year, it still sits there. Doesn’t do anything. The only “experience” I get of the owner’s manual working is, it demonstrates that it doesn’t work.  With or without any help from me..or anybody.
      * Doesn’t have any car with it. When the car was designed for me to operate it. The “owner’s manual” has no car in it. I can’t drive the owner’s manual to the shopping mall for coffee, and can't drive the owner’s manual back.
      * But you keep asking me the question “Does the owner’s manual work?” and, “where’s the evidence or experience of the owner’s manual working?” When I’ve never ever experienced the car owner’s manual ever took out the garbage, or mowed the lawn. Never even once did it, or could it drive me to my sister’s house. TO get in a fight with her again.
   * So, in a very real sense: I am ""praying"" continually - without ceasing, because my car is always with me and I look unto it, so the keys are always in my pocket that enable me to do this. That, without it, I can't do any of these things.

**So, what did you get out of this?**

**------    --------   ---------     ------  --------  ------**

**Prayer:**

* In your question. I mean, it’s YOUR question -  It's been asked many times and in many, many..way so many ways, all the same: TO me? Is like the “owner’s manual” above with me; in the illustration - - asked a like-same question: that has no car with it.

**So, add in the car - so you see it:**

* *Prayer:* In the Bible:
   * Is specifically mentioned 45 times in the four gospels. Matthew: 14 times. Mark: 12 times. Luke: 26 times; and John’s Gospel: 6 times.
   * Is mentioned 547 times in the whole Bible from Genesis 1:1 to Revelation 22:21 (Cover to cover)
* Don’t add the car in just yet.

That *prayer:*

* IN the original Greek of the New Testament is: < - \[**προσεύχεσθε (proseuchesthe)**\] - we get the word (English) “Prosecutor” like in a Court of Law, where a Judge presides over it. That just how “things” operate in that Court, is how the Judge “decrees” it.
   * So, the Prosecutor puts forth motions and rulings, that the Judge already decreed it. But the Prosecutor must first, in himself or herself “*fully believe”* that the Judge is the AUTHORITY in the Court. If he doesn't? Just goes to the town Waste Treatment Plant. With all this ""poop"" being pumped everyplace, put for petitions and motions - does not mean anything. It's all of none effect. No Judge with no authority in it. Vain repetitions. Empty words of no effect.
   * So, or BUT!  In instances where it is effective, is like, in Matthew 5:44.  Where Jesus says: “*But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you”*
      * That, in this case, where Jesus is the JUDGE: The “Prosecutor” must love the Defendant, shows he loves the Judge: (Yes, the defendant is his enemy on the opposite side; also facing the Judge).
      * Must “bless” the defendant, even he curses the Prosecutor, and do good to him, even if the defendant hates him. Even he despitefully uses the Prosecutor, the Prosecutor, to show he loves the Judge, must still **make “petitions” that are righteous in the defendant’s behalf.**
      * Already said it plainly “who” Jesus is in Matthew 28:18.  “*All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth*.” - Jesus Christ. **It’s already decreed. Prayer includes this of Matthew 5:44.**

**Prayer: Is often ‘paired’ - in** ***“prayers and supplications”***

* As in Hebrews 5:5-7 - that even Jesus offered them up: Says
* *“So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up* ***prayers and supplications*** *with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;”* \* supplications: < - {**ἱκετηρίας (hiketērias)**} - > Where in the same Court of Law, there’s no ruling on it; in fact, there’s even no basis for this ""hiketerias;"" but there’s a need.  And the Judge has the authority and the power to provided for needs; IF: you just ask him. \* And about the Judge what he says of himself - decrees it plainly, he's a merciful Judge. \* This same Judge says it in Exodus 20:5–6 “…*I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me;”* \* ***Oop. We just added the car into it.***

***------   -------  -------- --------    ---------***

* **The car:**
   * But maybe you still don’t see it. That in prayer; it's not the prayer that does anything. It’s the Judge that presides over all of it, that you regard him..but he's not even in your question.  If you regarded him, means you’d love him; to not regard him and just regard the power is in the petition, like that's where your question poop stuffs it in:
   * Because you made it or in the prayer alone; by itself or supplication which is just asking for a favour, because you asked it; all based on you..without any Judge in the Court; nor any car in it:
      * Can’t:  Person asks it? Nope. They do not:
   * Operate right. Isn’t licensed. Or recognized. Even the “opposite” is in effect over a person that thinks they can do it without any God in it.
      * Unable to use prayer. Not know exactly who he is. Lowly esteem him. Even they could make, straightway - - go to him, when they need him; even in an emergency. By him: *They would simply operate right.*
      * That means, when or if: they - - “look unto him” one time, or fifty, to 10,000 times, it goes “VROOOM!” and it simply speedily where I or you need him, he provide it. Because you, me, or anybody over the whole earth, whosoever it is, he “*enables” them* to operate in a way, that without him; can’t.
      * But because they regard him highly. As the authority: So they *speak well of him. Which is the definition of “worship” because he just works right. And they “accept him as true.” Which is the dictionary definition of they believe in him. He just is truth himself.*
* **So, in your question: “Who” are you praying to? Simple. Yourself. Then, wonder why it don't work right.**
   * ANYBODY that asks this question - that’s “how” they operate. Like a car’s owner’s manual. Without any car in it.

Prayer is really cool. It’s a two-way conversation. And in the case of me, most always a ""one-way"" conversation; but he hears me; and knows my petition and favours even before I'll ask them - he's just that good at it.  All because, he asked me, like, he asked everybody over the whole earth to ""Come unto him;"" ""Take a yoke upon me and learn of him"" (Matthew 11:28-30).

He's the authority. He asked everybody to do this.  And?

The Bible says: In James 1:19 “Wherefore, my beloved brethren, *let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak..”* Because, God already decreed: “*Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” - The Word of God.* \- Jesus Christ. (Matthew 4:4).  Prayer includes HEARING the Judge or the car that comes in the volume of the car owner's manual; but you got it as if the owner's manual does it, without any car come with it.

* It’s a decree how the Court operates. So, ANY Prosecutor has to believe in the Judge is the authority over all things. That he’s holy; righteous; and he’s merciful - showing it to 1000s that love him..if you love him, you just do what he says, because it operates right; righteous.

1pdov3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1pdov3s/6_rare_habits_that_instantly_raise_your_social/,6 Rare HABITS That Instantly Raise Your Social Status (Without Trying Too Hard),"Ever notice how some people walk into a room and instantly command respect, while others fade into the background? It’s not just charisma or good looks. After diving into behavioral science books, psych research, podcast convos with psychologists, and waaaay too many TikToks of people pretending to be sociopaths for clout, I’ve learned this: social status is a skill. It can be built. But it’s rarely what influencers say it is.

No, you don’t need to dominate every conversation, fake alpha energy, or wear $800 sneakers. Most viral tips are either outdated or just straight-up performative nonsense. If you’re done with the gimmicks and want real habits that *actually* elevate how people perceive you — in friend circles, on dates, and even at work — here’s your blueprint.

Let’s get into 6 surprisingly rare habits that boost your social status organically (and silently impress everyone around you).

---

## 1. Learn to “hold the frame” in conversation

People with high social value don’t rush to agree with everyone. They have a clear opinion. They don’t overexplain. They don’t wobble when someone disagrees. That’s called “holding the frame.”

- In simple terms: You let people into your worldview instead of constantly adapting to theirs.
- Example: If someone criticizes your favorite book or interest, you don’t shrink. You respond calmly, maybe even with curiosity — but you don’t immediately try to justify or defend.

According to psychologist Dr. David Buss (in his research on social hierarchy in evolutionary psychology), one key signal of social dominance is the ability to stay composed and centered during social conflict. You don’t need to “win” — you just need to look solid.

Recommended podcast: Lex Fridman’s interview with Chris Voss, former FBI negotiator, where he talks about “tactical empathy” and power in conversation.

---

## 2. Master the art of strategic silence

Most people overtalk. Especially when they’re nervous. High-status people? They know when NOT to speak. Silence after making a point makes it stronger. Silence before answering makes you look thoughtful.

- Try this: After someone asks you a question, take 2–3 seconds before answering. It signals confidence and depth.
- Pro tip: Use pauses instead of filler words. Instead of “uhh” or “like,” just… stop talking. Then continue.

In the book The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane (Wall Street Journal bestseller, based on her lectures at Stanford and MIT), she explains how presence + power + warmth = charisma. Pausing before you speak oozes all three.

---

## 3. Speak in outcomes, not just opinions

People listen to those who can simplify complexity. So, when you talk about ideas, get used to ending your point with a takeaway. Not just ""I think"", but “Here’s what it means.”

Example:

- Low-impact: “I don’t really trust AI. It’s weird.”
- High-impact: “AI’s moving fast, and if we don’t regulate it soon, it may be harder to audit it later.”

This subtle difference makes you sound more grounded and thoughtful.

One study published in the Journal of Language and Social Psychology found that listeners perceived speakers who used “summary-driven” speech patterns as more competent and trustworthy.

---

## 4. Be insanely good at remembering names (and using them naturally)

This sounds basic. But it’s a superpower almost no one uses. Using someone’s name in conversation (without overdoing it) makes people feel seen. It instantly personalizes the interaction.

- At networking events or social situations, make a mini game out of it. Associate their name with a visual or sound in your head.
- Use their name once when they introduce themselves, once during the convo, and once when you say bye.

Dale Carnegie wrote in How to Win Friends & Influence People (a timeless bestseller that influenced generations of leaders) that “a person’s name is, to that person, the sweetest sound in any language.” Still holds up — maybe even more now, when attention is rare.

---

## 5. Develop a signature taste

People remember you for what you repeatedly showcase. Having a specific interest — that’s real, not forced — builds personal mythos. You don't need 17 hobbies. Just one that you're genuinely into and can talk about with passion.

- Could be niche fashion, 90s anime, old-school jazz, martial arts, specialty coffee, silent films — whatever.
- Signal this subtly. Don’t brag. Just let it emerge naturally over time.

Having a signature taste makes you memorable. Identity psychologist Dan McAdams argued that “people judge your character unconsciously based on the consistency of your personal narrative.” In plain English: the more distinct and consistent your interests, the more people feel like they “get” who you are.

---

## 6. Don’t chase status — curate it

This is the paradox. People with real presence don’t try so hard to look cool. They don’t seek validation. They signal value by curating their energy, attention and time.

Here’s what that looks like:

- You leave a social setting on your terms, not when everyone’s already bored.
- You don’t cling to every invite. You pick a few events and show up with full engagement.
- You’re kind, but you have boundaries. You say no without overexplaining.

Harvard researcher Dr. Amy Cuddy, in her viral TED talk and book Presence (NYT bestseller), said that true confidence comes from internal alignment, not trying to prove yourself. When you stop needing external praise, your presence becomes more magnetic.

---

### Some tools that help you build this energy:

- Ash app (for relationship dynamics and emotional coaching): Ash is like your personal therapist in your pocket. Trained in psychology-backed scripts, it helps you navigate awkward convos, relationship anxiety, and maintain boundaries. Deeply underrated.
- Finch (habit-building but cute): This app gamifies personal growth by helping you build consistency in micro-habits. Helpful if you want to cultivate any of the behaviors above.
- BeFreed (a personalized audio learning app): Recently went viral on X (1M+ views) and for good reason. Built by AI experts from Google and Columbia grads, BeFreed turns books, expert interviews, and research into personalized podcast lessons tailored to your goals. I use it to dive deep into topics like status games, social dynamics, and persuasive communication. You can set the episode length (10-min summary or a 40-min deep dive), choose the tone and voice (mine’s a chill, calming narrator), and even ask mid-episode questions. It’s like having a personal mentor in your ears. No brainer for any lifelong learner. Just use it and thank me.
- YouTube: “Charisma on Command” channel has solid breakdowns of how public figures handle interviews, conflict, persuasion — worth a binge.
- Podcast: Hidden Brain by Shankar Vedantam. Thought-provoking episodes on social psychology, group dynamics, and why we act the way we do.

### Book rec: This one changed everything for me

The book? The Status Game by Will Storr. It’s a Sunday Times bestseller. Storr is an award-winning journalist and psychology writer. This book will make you question everything you think you know about why humans do what they do — and how much of it is just subconscious status-chasing. He explains how religious groups, billionaires, influencers, and even everyday friendships all revolve around invisible status signals. Insanely insightful read. This is the best psychology book I’ve ever read on status.

If you read it with intention, you’ll never engage with your social world the same way again.

One in particular, let's call him Mark, I find attractive. We've chatted when he's waited on me before, but I just took it as good customer service. 

It was different this last time I went in. I sat at the bar like I normally do and was greeted by another bartender. As I sat down, Mark shouts from the other end of the restaurant, ""Oh hey! Didn't we just see you last week?"" He then came and chatted with me several times in between him running and taking orders. We just had some pretty bad weather, so we talked about that, which led to him showing me pictures of his dad's property that got a lot of snow. He then talked about his own family some more. If he got called to do something, he always assured me that he'd be back to finish the conversation. And I was getting a flirty vibe from him, too. 

Now I know it's a bit of a faux pas to ask someone in the service industry for a date while they're on the clock, and I'm not sure how to properly navigate it. I'm thinking if I see him again, and we still have some decent conversation considering he's at work, that I would just write my number on the back of the receipt, give it to him on my way out, and tell him to message me if he's interested in grabbing a drink or coffee sometime. However, I don't want to be that awkward guy that comes in and has a reputation for flirting with the staff, especially since I really like that restaurant.

1pdolfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1pdolfs/affair_for_25_years/,Affair for 2.5 years.,"I (married) had a long, messy affair with a close friend (also married). We knew each other for about four years before anything sexual happened. Once it did, we agreed it would be “monogamous” between us (besides our spouses). Feelings eventually got involved. She told me she loved me. I said it back.

The dynamic worked… until it didn’t.

We would meet up often for coffee, talk for about an hour, then have sex. It was fun, exciting, and we meshed perfectly — both in conversation and sexually. We hung out constantly with our spouses and group of friends because we loved being around each other. There were times she would cry about how badly she needed me. She sent nudes often as “gifts,” but really they were ego boosts. She loved the sexual bond we had and how desired she felt. She even told some of her close friends about us — they noticed how happy she seemed.

But then everything shifted.

She started protecting herself by disconnecting emotionally — almost like she didn’t want to allow the possibility of a real future with me. She would go long stretches without wanting sex or meeting up — weeks to months — yet we’d still see each other when our friend groups were together. Then suddenly out of nowhere she’d text asking for sex or just a quick release from foreplay. She bragged about how good I am, constantly complimented my dick — yet she’d also tell me about how she almost met up with another guy but he bailed last minute. That drove me nuts. I’d get jealous but tried playing it cool on the outside.

I couldn’t figure out why she needed other options when I was right there.

I needed reassurance that I was still the only one she was having sex with. Our secret relationship became exhausting because of how up and down she was. One moment she’d make me feel desired — kissing me secretly when we went out with friends — then go silent for days. I felt tortured. I would confess my love hoping she’d reciprocate, and she would dismiss it by saying, “I know, but you have to disassociate like I do.”

Things said she knew would hurt me:

After sex in my truck once, she started crying — questioning how her life would’ve been if she married this one guy she knew before her husband. It hurt me hearing this knowing she didn’t feel this way for me at all. She ended it with “I know you don’t like hearing this and I’m sorry.”

At one point, I told her I was done and just wanted friendship. I told her to find someone else as a FWB. She said no — that she keeps choosing me because I can fuck really good and I’m convenient. She didn’t want to explain her situation to a random guy.

I would get random texts from her saying she just got banged out really good by her husband. I told her to respect my boundaries and to never tell me that shit again. It didn’t make sense because our affair started due to her husband being terrible in bed and not taking care of her needs. Plus, he wasn’t even close to being as well endowed as me or able to give her the sexual connection that we had.

This went on for 2.5 years.

I got depressed from the lack of reciprocation. It felt like unrequited love. One day I blew up and accused her of finding a new supply. She insisted there wasn’t anyone else, but she held the accusation over my head and refused to accept any apology afterward. Months passed. I tried apologizing again and again — genuine and sincere — but she rejected all attempts.

Weeks passed and we planned a date night with friends. Naturally she was there. We bar-hopped and she made constant sexual innuendos toward me. She dressed sexy on purpose. It was like she wanted me to remember what I was missing — and punish me. We still had a lot of unresolved issues so she was snappy and rude to me so I told her in front of her husband and my wife, “if you aren’t my wife or my girl, you have no right to disrespect me or talk to me in that way, now turn around and get the fuck moving”. She looked at her husband for protection and he didn’t budge at all. So she stormed off.

Later that night I received a text from her husband, painting me as the bad guy. She manipulated my text and used them to say I was making advances at her. She never told him her part in all of this. So I sent him pictures of our conversations and her asking me for meetups and sex. I haven’t heard from Her since.

Thanks and kudos to you if you lasted this long to read all the way through.

My questions for women to answer, please be honest:

• Have you ever been in a similar situation — married, involved in a long affair, pulling the other person close and then pushing them away?

• Looking back, what was actually going on in your head?

• Did you truly love the person, or were they just meeting needs your spouse wasn’t?

• Did you see the other person as “supply” even if you said you loved them?

• When you ended it, did you think about them afterward or regret how you treated them?

• Did you ever feel guilty about the emotional damage you caused?

• Will she ever reach out to me? ",1,1764816607.0,adultery,1,0.67,False
1pdoldn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pdoldn/mf_the_porch/,[MF] The Porch,"Over the years, I've devoted a lot of thought to how time passes on this porch. Now I wish it would slip away. I'm stuck here, with one less blood vessel to my brain than I had years ago. It is not a bad place to be paralyzed. I overlook a lifetime of memories. I see her grave, and I see the woodchips under the magnolia, all out of place. It's the perfect spot for a garden to go.

When she passed, the stress tore me down. Tending to her grave was a light in the void. She deserved every perfect detail. I spent days and nights picking weeds, removing fallen leaves, and even setting woodchips around the mulch in the correct directions. I had set out to build a perfect garden, and finally had every detail in place. The kids peered from the windows.

The day I was going to start planting, I felt the numbness. The sweat from the beating sun began to feel electric on my face. I turned to the house. One of the kids was watching me. I yelled at him. I faltered over my words. He sprinted out. I collapsed at his feet. We drove into the darkness of the night, and followed the fluorescent yellow among the black roads to the hospital.

Now my final resting place is only 20 yards from hers. Not a single plant there. I'm stuck looking at woodchips, all in the wrong direction.

I think my sons had the right idea, setting me out, each evening, with the best view in our world. I sit here each day wanting to leap toward her. I want to run out like she did with the kids, each day, toward the bus, before school. Despite my best effort, my legs won't move.

In elementary school, that rusty bus delivered elation to the family each day. The kids loved school. It became routine for us to all stand, noses glued on the window, afraid any words would cut the tension. When the bus came within view, I knew I could return to my work, to the pressing mail I cannot remember now. But the rest, they would all patter and wobble around before rushing out the door, their mother included.

I never once jumped off this porch and I sure as shit won't now. The afternoon drags on slowly out here when you're unable to partake in it. The sun freezes on the horizon and the coffee keeps its warmth, one day passes after another. I only wish I could keep her close, like we used to before the kids.

That first day we moved in, the evening shade moved in from the horizon towards the new center of our world. Where the shallow hills, long road, and sparse trees all meet, we sat together and saw that shade sneak towards us. I remember how we waited here, on this porch. After a day of carelessly passing the time, there was silence. We moved closer. The light that the dark had erased was renewed by her warmth. She whispered to me, and it felt like my ear froze. I pulled her in tighter and kept my silence.

The magnolia tree and the buzzing flies are the only ones that keep me company out here, now. The kids are constantly working in the house. I long for that time when she whispered to my heart, or when the cacophony this house was filled with first arrived.

I had forgotten how silence echoed in this house since the day we brought our second son home. We stunned our walking toddler with his newborn little brother. The boy looked curiously at first, like he was missing his magnifying glass, and made his mother burst out with laughter. The image of the boy reaching for his kid brother to lift him up is imprinted in my mind. I retreated to the quiet inside to watch the news as our oldest son and his mother vibrated the walls with laughter for at least an hour.

When the evening comes, and the flies leave me alone, and the wind is dead, I can still hear that muffled laughter. It's like the magnolia tree leans in and echoes it back to me as it remembers it, after all of these years.

The magnolia tree has only proven to be my closest friend in old age. The flies, however, are my number one enemy. The worst inconvenience to my immobile life is the inability to swat the flies. They used to pry at me, but now I think they have realized I can't fight back. They practically live on me now. The only relief I feel is when that shade starts creeping in and the fireflies start lighting up. I know the gnats are soon gone, mosquitos are another story.

That creeping shade brought plenty of new discoveries for our young guys, years ago. They also used to complain of gnats and mosquitoes. They would chase any nagging critters out of the house with a fly swatter, me directly behind them to scoop them up and turn them around. I remember my stomach tightening when they left the front stairs, like they were never gonna stop running away.

Other times brought good discoveries. The chaos that ensued with firefly season, for instance. The boys weaved around the magnolia tree and their heads swiveled from one bug's light to another, never able to focus for long. She was right there with them. I remember how the humidity used to penetrate that screen door from where I watched. It used to sit on my skin like a coating of superglue and I would have to retreat to the kitchen. They would all come in soon after, covered in sweat, and ready for a nighttime snack.

They are the ones preparing my food today. They trade off coming out on the hour to give me a snack. As odd as it seems, you take for granted being able to feed yourself. I don't long for using a fork and knife, but I miss the rituals of food. I would set the table and decide on the meal. I could direct the conversation, and if it was not to my liking, I could put the fork down and get back to my work. For dinner, we sit in the same spot still, out here on the porch as the magnolia tree leans closer to see what we are picking at.

We have always eaten on the porch. Rain or shine and no matter how late in the night it got. The headlights of her car coming up that long road was like a moving lighthouse. Sometimes, I could hear them, before the headlights. Whenever she went to pick them up from college on a long weekend, she would blast what she thought the current music was. They used to hate it.

I would have the porch all set and they would tumble out of the car directly to the table. As we ate, they would ask me questions about my college experience. I left out the good parts about the late nights and trouble she and I used to get into. I thought there would be plenty of time to tell them those stories. Some time when they were not as susceptible to their parents' words. I imagined the laughs we could share when I would tell them in the future. But at all our dinners, it was mostly simple sentences filled in between by soundless bites.

She had a knack for filling that void. She asked the right questions and ignited passion in our kids at the table. And her laugh, it roped you out of wherever you were venturing in your own mind and pulled you back to the present. She made every moment feel more important than the last, and it was only in the stillness that I could find the time to appreciate it. And it was in that stillness that I looked forward to her next act, which would almost assuredly occur as soon as you thought of it.

When she first was diagnosed, I could sense those silences lengthening. First I could only tell when watching intently. In between two moments she would fleet away and return with a blink. She fought like hell though. Lived her life as she had for the past 50 years, like each day was her last. Soon, though, the lulls lengthened and the calm started feeling more like a tension. As strong as she was, the disease was unrelenting.

We used to sit on the porch in the evenings, when she got sick, and time had never gone by as quickly. Taking one another in each others' arms was no longer strong enough to outlast the cold of the night. The cold pushed us inside. Her agonizing cries of pain echo in my head like a fire alarm for the past 5 years. The long bouts of weakness in between, where she did not have the strength to even ask for help, those are the details that deliver my worst pains to this day.

We buried her out by the magnolia. Dug all day in the rain. The soil was wet and easy to shovel. I was giving instructions on where to direct the dirt, and telling the kids not to hit the gas lines. I was getting old, and could not dig as well as them. The oldest had heaped some dirt on my feet, he turned to me and sobbed.

He said something that is imprinted in my mind alongside the other family memorabilia. He told me his mother would say she loved him all the time and he looked deep into my eyes. There was such a gravity behind his glossed over eyes it distorted time. And I froze. I patted him on the back, turned on a heel, and walked inside. We buried her a few hours later.

So now, my permanent shade has finally arrived. The days I spend out here now are stacked against a lifetime of sitting here, me and her. Now, it's just me. Alone with my thoughts. Listening to the flies buzz and the leaves wave. Unable to partake. Patiently waiting.

I hear the kids talk about what they'll do soon enough. One wants to raise his own family here, the other can't bear the difficult memories. So they argue about what I would want, what she would want. They argue until the dusk becomes black. That's when the oldest comes for me.

""You ready pops?""

And that's the time, everyday, I pray to God. I pray to him to give me strength. The strength she had been beaming with. Just for a moment and just for a small act. With every ounce I could, I pleaded from deep in my heart for the ability to reach out. To touch my oldest son's face just like the first day I met him. To get a good look at his eyes that came from his better half and to see the grin that would be so recognizable from the days they chased fireflies. But I called on God long after the sun fell beyond the furthest hills. And with the sun gone, I assumed God had gone too, because all I felt was the ache in my throat. Silence sat in the air. So today, yesterday, and all the days I have known him, my best efforts fall short once more.

I moved into The Ellison about a week ago and figured I’d share my experience so far in case anyone in the area is curious about the new complex.

# 1) Leasing & Move-In

The leasing team was easy to work with, and move-in itself went smoothly. They seem responsive and pretty helpful whenever I’ve had questions.

# 2) Amenities

Just a heads-up: the amenities aren’t open yet. That includes the gym, pool, podcast studio, coffee area, and grab-and-go market. They mentioned these should start opening in the near future, but for now everything is still under construction.

# 3) Construction

The property has three buildings total. Two are fully residential, and the third is the main amenities building. Some areas around the third building are still under construction, so expect workers, noise during the day, and the occasional blocked-off section. Some people are already living in that building though, so some parts must be finished.

# 4) The Apartment Itself

My unit has been great so far. Everything inside is brand new, with modern appliances and a keypad entry door. I haven’t run into any issues with the interior or maintenance. Sound-wise, I haven’t heard much from neighbours (although I’m not sure I have any right next to me yet).

# Overall

Even with the unfinished amenities, I’ve been pretty happy with the place so far. Just wanted to share an honest first-week impression for anyone who’s seen the new construction and wondered what it’s like living here.

1pdog17,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingNashville/comments/1pdog17/ellison_cool_springs_things_to_know/,Ellison Cool Springs - Things To Know,"Hi y’all,

I just moved into **The Ellison** about a week ago, so I figured I’d share some info for anyone considering moving here.

**1) Move-In Specials**

Right now they’re advertising: *“Save over $8,000 in Free Rent + more limited-time perks.”*

In reality, this works out to **two months of free rent**.

As of **Dec 1**, they also added an extra **$1,250** for moving in before the end of the year. If you qualify for their **preferred employer** program, that’s another **$750** off — so for a 1-bedroom, the total discount ends up being close to **three months’ worth of rent**. This wasn’t available in November, so it looks like a new push to fill units.

**2) Amenities (as of Dec 2, 2025)**

None of the amenities are finished yet.

No gym, no pool, no podcast studio, no grab-and-go market, no coffee bar — literally *nothing* is open at the moment.

They’ve said some amenities *should* be done in January, but… we’ll see. They also mentioned offering gym memberships to current tenants while construction continues, but I haven’t received any details or follow-up.

**3) Construction**

There are three buildings total — two parallel residential buildings and a third “main” building where all the amenities are supposed to be.

The third building is still very much an active construction site. Leasing will tell you it’s move-in ready, but it’s definitely not fully finished. Expect noise during the day, workers around the property, blocked-off walkways, etc.

That said, people *are* moving into the third building, so some units must be complete.

**4) Actual Apartment Quality**

This is the part I’ve been pleasantly surprised by.

Inside the units, everything is brand new and pretty nice. All appliances are Samsung, and so far I haven’t had any issues with build quality or maintenance. The keyless door entry with keypad is convenient. The walls seem fairly thick — I haven’t heard much noise, though I’m not sure if I have neighbours yet.

The leasing office has been responsive and easy to work with, so no concerns there.

# Overall Impression

I’m pretty satisfied with the move so far. It’s definitely a bummer that **none of the amenities are done yet**, but I’m hoping they offer some sort of perks or compensation to current residents until everything is completed.

It's actually been a few weeks since I made the final payment to clear out the last of my nine federal student loans. I wasn't going to post about it because I'm not sure if anyone cares, but my excitement bubbled up after receiving the letter this morning confirming my $0 balance.

I graduated a decade ago with just over $26,000 in student loans. I had no financial support from my parents and paid my own way through college, working full time while also trying to tackle credit card debit that piled up from a couple of out-of-state, unpaid summer internships. 

My first job out of college paid just $37,000, and for years, I could really only afford to pay the minimum on my student loans. By 2019, the interest was really starting to stack up. The extra payments I made — $20 here, $15 there — barely made a dent. So although my total loan balance was far smaller than some of the numbers I've come across on this subreddit, it still often felt like an impossible hurdle to overcome because of my low income and other debts.

And then 2020 happened. Unexpectedly, I had extra room in my monthly budget because of the pause on student loan payments. I never imagined that the pause would stretch on for as long as it did. But in that time, I hopped jobs and more than doubled my income. I paid off my credit card debt that had snowballed ever since those unpaid internships. I was putting money away into a HYSA for my loans. But just as things started to look up, the announcement came about the $20K forgiveness plan. I qualified, applied and was approved, so I used the money I put away in my HYSA on a down payment for a car. I think we all know what happened next...

Fast-forward to the SAVE administrative forbearance. As frustrated as I was about all the uncertainty around the plan, I decided to view it as a second chance to get ahead! While interest was paused, I once again started putting money away into my HYSA. In January, I set the goal to have enough saved to clear my outstanding $19K balance before the forbearance ended. I committed to a ""no buy"" challenge for the year and started budgeting/tracking all my transactions for the first time in my life. Every extra dollar I had went toward my student loan fund. My credit card's cashback rewards were also deposited into my HYSA. I can't believe how quickly it came together once I locked in on this goal.

  
In the process, I managed to rewire my relationship with money and spending. I no longer ""crave"" shopping. I'm thoughtful about how, when and where I spend my money. I stopped eating out all the time and ""treating"" myself to coffee every morning. I was able to knock out my student loans while also fully funding an emergency fund and maxing out, for the first time ever, my Roth IRA.

I worked really hard to pay these loans off, but I also fully recognize how unbelievably lucky I was to have had an unprecedented pause on student loan payments and a zero interest period happen back-to-back. I think my situation today would look vastly different if not for those two things. Wishing everyone the best on their debt payoff journeys! ❣️",10,1764816193.0,StudentLoans,1,1.0,False

I love my nieces and nephews and wouldn’t hurt their feelings for the world but jeez. I can’t anymore. 

My in-laws only talk about their kids. I can’t take it anymore. Everyone sits around the table waiting for them to finish talking about nothing and the parents brag on and on about their kids. It is good to do that to an extent but it is to the exclusion of everyone else. 

Do all aunts and uncles hang on every syllable of their nieces and nephews for hours on end? I want to talk to my adult family too. Am I the only one suffering through a 4th grader obviously lying in his story once again while everyone applauds him or her?

The last year I’ve slightly pulled back from them b/c I noticed the relationships were one sided. 

I was asked to host and organize most of the family events. I got birthday and Christmas lists sent to me, I was invited to all the kid’s milestones but not the adult ones. 

This year I reached out several times to some of them only to be ghosted or put off with the vague- “yes let’s get a coffee soon”. But babysitting, dog sitting, helping with setting up events or doing the planning and hosting it’s on me. I love that stuff. 

So I ghosted a text from someone who ignored mine, I sent the same bday text I got instead of a call and gift. I haven’t reached out. 

And guess what? Radio silence. They really don’t care. Am I the annoying and desperate old Aunty?  Am I selfishly transactional?

I love my nieces and nephews but I really want to back off most of the school plays, recitals and games - not all but most. Thank you for your feedback.

I decided to go into the café and get a cup of coffee. I’ve been in there maybe 3-4 times in the past, all pre-Covid, and the owner was nice enough. Not deep conversations but he was friendly and told me he was from Greece. 

So I went inside and he was behind the counter with his back to me, doing something. There was one other customer up at the front of the store by the window, reading a newspaper. I stood at the counter for a second, and the owner turned around and saw me. He didn’t say anything, just went back to whatever he was doing. Then someone came in the back door with a box and handed it to him. They started speaking Greek to each other, which I don’t understand, but the new guy gestured to me and clearly said something like, “you have a customer here.” The café owner waved at me dismissively, like “nah.” The guy seemed a little surprised by that.

* White rice (small portion)
* Oatmeal (without milk if you're sensitive)

**Avoid After 5 PM:**

* Red meat (takes 4-6 hours to digest)
* Nuts and seeds
* Raw vegetables
* Any fried foods
* Cheese or high-fat dairy

# Morning Routine That Reduces Symptoms 80%

This transformed my mornings from mucus-filled misery to manageable:

**Upon Waking (Empty Stomach):**

1. Warm water with 1/4 tsp sea salt (helps acid production)
2. Wait 20 minutes
3. Take Betaine HCL supplement (if your test showed low acid)
4. Wait 10 more minutes

**Breakfast (30 min after waking):**

* 2-3 scrambled eggs (cooked in small amount of olive oil)
* 1/2 cup cooked oats OR 1 slice sourdough toast (fermented = lower histamine)
* Small portion of low-histamine fruit (fresh blueberries, not bananas)
* Herbal tea (ginger or chamomile, lukewarm not hot)

**Why this works:** Protein + moderate carbs + fat balance keeps you full, provides amino acids for gut healing, and doesn't spike blood sugar (which feeds candida).

# The Food Combination Rules Nobody Mentions

**DO NOT MIX:**

* Proteins + High-starch carbs in large amounts (steak + potato = digestive nightmare)
* Multiple high-histamine foods in one meal (tomatoes + aged cheese + wine = inflammation bomb)
* Cold drinks with meals (dilutes stomach acid)

**DO COMBINE:**

* Protein + non-starchy vegetables (chicken + steamed broccoli)
* Healthy fats + vegetables (olive oil on salad)
* Small portion starch + vegetables (rice + green beans)

# Weekly Meal Structure for Low Acid, Low Histamine, Low Carb

# Monday - Thursday (Strict Healing Phase)

**Breakfast Options:**

* Egg white omelet with zucchini and a little olive oil
* Overnight oats (soaked, not raw) with fresh blueberries
* Rice porridge with a pinch of salt and cooked apple

**Lunch Options:**

* Grilled chicken breast with steamed carrots and green beans
* White fish with quinoa and roasted butternut squash
* Turkey meatballs (fresh ground, not processed) with rice and cucumber

**Dinner Options:**

* Baked cod with mashed sweet potato and asparagus
* Chicken soup (homemade broth) with rice noodles and celery
* Ground turkey with cauliflower rice and cooked spinach

**Snacks (if needed):**

* Rice cakes with thin layer of almond butter
* Fresh melon (small amount)
* Herbal crackers with hummus (small portion)

# Friday - Sunday (Maintenance with 80/20 rule)

Follow the same base, but you can try reintroducing ONE potentially triggering food per day to test tolerance. Track everything.

# The Supplement Schedule That Made the Difference

**Timing matters as much as the supplements themselves:**

**Morning (with breakfast):**

* Betaine HCL (start with 1 capsule, work up to 2-3)
* Zinc (25mg)
* Vitamin D3 + K2

**Lunch (with meal):**

* Digestive enzymes (full spectrum)
* Butyric acid (500mg)

**Dinner (with meal):**

* Betaine HCL (lower dose than breakfast)
* Digestive enzymes

**Before Bed:**

* Probiotic (start with 1-2 billion CFU, not the high-dose ones that cause inflammation)
* L-Glutamine powder (5g in water - repairs gut lining)

# Tracking: The Secret Weapon

Here's what changed everything: **I started tracking every single meal and symptom.**

Within 2 weeks, I discovered:

* I could tolerate oats but not wheat
* Cucumber gave me more mucus (high histamine when not super fresh)
* Eating after 7 PM = guaranteed reflux next morning
* Coffee substitutes (chicory) were actually worse than no coffee at all

**Track These Daily:**

* Each meal (with times)
* Symptoms (throat mucus, reflux, breathing issues) - rate 1-10
* Bowel movements (consistency = gut health indicator)
* Sleep quality
* Stress levels
* Supplement timing

# The Foods I Thought Were Safe But Weren't

These shocked me when I finally tracked properly:

❌ **Bananas** \- High histamine when ripe, caused throat tightness ❌ **Spinach** \- High oxalate, increased mucus ❌ **Bone broth** \- High histamine despite being ""healing"" ❌ **Avocado** \- High histamine, triggered inflammation ❌ **Leftovers over 24 hours old** \- Histamine increases in stored food ❌ **""Healthy"" smoothies** \- Cold + mixed food = digestive chaos

# My Current 70% Improvement Protocol

**Daily Non-Negotiables:**

1. Baking soda test once per week (tracking acid levels)
2. No food 3.5 hours before bed
3. Elevated bed (6-inch risers under head)
4. Stress management (10 min meditation daily)
5. Detailed food journal

**Weekly Tasks:**

* Meal prep on Sunday (fresh food = lower histamine)
* Review symptom patterns
* Adjust one variable if needed
* Candida protocol check-in

# The Meal Prep Strategy That Saved Me Time

**Sunday Prep (2 hours):**

* Cook 3 proteins: chicken breast, white fish, ground turkey
* Steam vegetables: carrots, green beans, zucchini, broccoli
* Cook grains: white rice, quinoa (small amounts)
* Portion into containers for Mon-Thu

**Store Properly:**

* Freeze portions you won't eat within 24 hours (reduces histamine)
* Use glass containers (no plastic chemicals)
* Label with dates

# Resources That Help Track Progress

For anyone serious about healing, I cannot stress enough: **track everything**. Pattern recognition is how you'll find YOUR specific triggers.

I use a combination of spreadsheet tracking and photos of every meal. It sounds obsessive, but after 2 months, you'll have data that's more valuable than any generic diet plan.

[**I've found that keeping a detailed food journal with meal timing and symptom tracking has been essential—this newsletter shares more specific meal plans and tracking templates that have helped me**](https://gentlegourmet.app/newsletter)

# What's Next in My Journey

I'm now testing:

* Gradual reintroduction of fermented foods (sauerkraut in tiny amounts)
* Testing my histamine threshold with fresh fish
* Slowly increasing probiotic dose
* Adding specific anti-candida foods (coconut oil, garlic - carefully)

# The Bottom Line

The original post about low stomach acid, candida, and gut dysfunction is absolutely correct in my experience. But here's what I learned: **You can't heal what you don't track.**

The diet changes work, but only if you:

1. Know your baseline (acid test, symptom severity)
2. Track meals and symptoms religiously for at least 30 days
3. Make ONE change at a time
4. Give each change 1-2 weeks to show results
5. Don't give up when you have bad days (they're data points, not failures)

My symptoms decreased 70% in 3 months using this approach. I'm still healing, but I finally feel like I'm in control instead of the disease controlling me.

**Quick Start Checklist:**

*  Do the baking soda test tomorrow morning
*  Buy Betaine HCL and digestive enzymes this week
*  Clear out all high-histamine foods from kitchen
*  Set up a simple tracking system (notebook or app)
*  Prep first week of meals focusing on the safe foods listed
*  Schedule eating times (breakfast, lunch, early dinner)
*  Order bed risers or extra pillows

**Remember:** This is a journey, not a race. Every small improvement is progress. Your body CAN heal—it just needs the right environment and enough time.

This grinder started as a crowdfunded project and has now evolved into a serious piece of kit for home baristas.



Here are my key takeaways:



🔹 First Impressions



• Full metal build, sleek modern design — feels more like an art piece than a kitchen gadget.





🔹 Quiet Power



• 400W brushless DC motor, variable RPM (500–1500).

• Surprisingly quiet even at high speed — perfect for morning brews without waking the house.





🔹 Features That Stand Out



• Integrated dosing cup with built-in scale → single dosing workflow is seamless.

• Low retention (18g in = 18g out with RDT).

• Easy cleaning with magnetic top plate and reliable zero-point alignment.





🔹 Grind Quality



• Pour Over & AeroPress: consistent, clean extractions.

• Espresso: sweet spot around setting 2.5 → smooth, milk chocolate flavor.

• Handles both coarse and fine grinds confidently.





🔹 Burrs & Mod Potential



• Stock 64mm burrs perform well, but the design allows easy upgrades (SSP, La Marzocco Brew, etc.).





\---



✅ Final Verdict



The VelPro 400 is quiet, powerful, mod-friendly, and genuinely elevates the home coffee setup. If you’re looking for a single-doser with low retention and pro-level features, this is a strong contender.

I've been on the apps for over 10 years on and off and honestly I actually do pretty well on apps - which is not a brag in the slightest, since I'm single (so how good could it be..). I have met a few past GFs off the apps over the years, but I usually find people on there either fresh off a break-up, or just on there out of boredom who are ""emotionally unavailable"". So I'm just tired of putting my romantic future in the hands of an app designed to keep you coming back. I started seeing someone over the summer for a few months and it was going great, then it just abruptly ended. It's been about 6 weeks and I'm still reeling over it, like this is just going to keep off happening off these apps isn't it...something has to change. Btw, some will say this is user error or whatever, but like I said it's not that I don't have success on the app, it's more the need to look outside of that environment where you have ample choice/app mindset.

Recently, I was having a convo with some people and one of the women was like ""I can't seem to find a man"" and I was like ""what about the apps?"" to which she replied ""I've never been on them"". At that moment it dawned on me (and this is going to sound dumb lol)..wait, not every single single person is on the apps? I've also heard many women say ""I honestly wish a guy would just approach me while I'm out and about"". I never even consider that simply because I always think ah, I'll just stick the apps and save the potentially awkward situation incase she has a bf, or whatever. Though I would do it, I just don't want to impose on someone who wants to be left alone. I've even heard of people meeting at work - this one I find particularly insane cuz I work in finance/corporate environment and I can just picture this sort of situation being an HR department's Magnum Opus lol

**So TL;DR:** that brings me to my question: where did you meet your partner if not on a dating app? Was it at a coffee shop? (I've heard this is a thing - absolutely alien concept to me lol), An event? A bar? Are there places you shouldn't try to talk to someone? What's socially acceptable?

1pdnwsd,https://i.redd.it/j9afbnm8k35g1.jpeg,There are far sadder implications to Mike not moving an inch getting scooped (Kinda disorganized yap session & sensitive topics & more of a character analysis than a lore analysis),"Now there’s a lot in the air about Micheal letting himself be scooped, he 100% could’ve walked like 10 inches and not get scooped but he didn’t. (Personally one funny theory of mine is that he approaches all situations by just standing still like a deer and it just so happened not to work in this scenario but that’s more just a joke)
Anyway there are theories that say he was tied up somehow in that little time or Ennard’s unseen arm is somehow long enough to keep him in place, but I believe the real reason as to why he let himself is 1. To help Elisabeth escape, and 2. Because he was suicidal.

Micheal is honestly one of my favorite characters in the franchise (as someone who likes the characters far more than the story itself), he’s just so interesting to me, we know that the reason he kept coming back to SL was to somehow find Elizabeth and help her, but looking at it from a story perspective I think the reason why he was so adamant is clear, he regrets what he did to CC and wants to make the effort to be a good brother now.

Now that he ALONE has the chance and is one of THE ONLY people who can find her, he’s on a quest now to finally prove to himself that he can be a good brother now.

After (likely) piecing together that she died during his time in the location I feel like that must’ve took a toll on his mind. If you were to look into his eyes, you’d have to know that you not only killed your own brother and never fully appreciated him while he was alive, but also had failed to protect your younger sister and now she’s stuck in a facility underground, getting tortured because of it.

Mike is a smart character, smart enough to listen to old audio tapes and use the suit his father is trapped in with cheap scares in a horror attraction to combat him. He was very likely aware of Baby’s trickery at this point (like she literally shoved him in a springlock suit the night before and talked about how she lied c’mon), it just doesn’t make much sense for him to be dumb enough to EVEN COME BACK unless you take into account his motivations, FIND HIS SISTER AND HELP HER. At this point he probably felt completely useless, since at the time he had failed everyone he’d loved and let them die, he went through all this trouble for her and risked literally everything for her but he STILL FAILED; at that point Baby was probably aware of that too, she didn’t even need to knock him out or anything, Ennard could’ve totally waited in the hall and caught him like Foxy in Night 3 but there was no point, he’d offer himself up in a heartbeat because this was really all he could offer to her at this point, all he could do to help her.

Now I know it kinda feels like it delves into fan fiction territory but Suicide isn’t exactly new, after all the ending of FNaF 6 is one. If we listen to Mike’s speech at the end of SL we can hear how melancholic he is, after all he failed at almost everything but letting this monster barely recognizable to his sister loose on the world. However it seemed like he found new purpose after dwelling on what his father did.

This especially makes sense on Henry’s whole speech where he says it’s “right where he wants to be” he was find just dying if it gave one final helping hand to his sister, but now, not only is his sister freed, but many other souls and the tragedy if the place along with it, along with taking his father out as well. This is EXACTLY where he wants to be, this is his ideal send off in his eyes, he finally redeemed himself in his eyes by being a good brother in the now.

Anyway yeah Micheal’s character is just so interesting to me because when you really just listen to what him and his peers say he becomes such a tragic character, I genuinely adore him and he’s an amazing hero for the series (and honestly kinda parallels a bit of Coffee from TDH in that regard which just really sells me on him)",13,1764814718.0,fnaftheories,10,0.93,False

-1E-

She wandered the hallway of her apartment with slow, uncertain steps as one hand trailed along the wall like she needed it to hold her up. She whispered to herself as she moved.

“I was… I was doing something… wasn’t I?”

Her voice had a trembling, papery thinness, like she was afraid of startling her own thoughts into hiding.

The faint scent of something tugged at her nose. Something unknown. Something important. She followed it into the kitchen, sniffing the air, checking the sink, the fridge, even the trash can. 
Nothing.
She opened the fridge again, checked the sink, the fridge again and the trash can. 
Nothing, still.

A knock startled her so sharply she clutched her own chest.

She opened the door to reveal a broad shouldered and gentle eyed man standing in the entrance of her apartment.

“Oh, sweetheart,” she said, soft and relieved. “You came home so fast.” 

He blinked, offering a sad smile. “It’s just me, ma’am. The super.”

Confusion flickered across her face like a shadow passing a window. Her words stuttered, afraid and apologetic. “Oh. Yes. Of course. I knew that. I just…something smells strange. I can’t find it.”

“I’ll take a look, ma’am.” he said kindly, stepping inside.

She followed him anxiously, hovering in doorways as he checked vents, pipes, and corners. Then he moved to her bedroom as the woman lingered behind him. 

“What does it smell like?” he asked, crouching by the bedroom vent.

She opened her mouth, and paused.
“It’s… I don’t know anymore,” she whispered. “It was something. Something from… somewhere.”

He stood, brushing off his hands.
“I don’t smell anything,” he said with regret in his voice but a soft smile curled on his face as he spoke to her gently. “But I’ll come back tomorrow. I’ll check everything here again and also the vents in the empty unit next door too, alright?”

She nodded gratefully.
“Thank you, sweetheart. It’s so nice to have you home.” 

He didn’t correct her this time.

When he left, the quiet swallowed the apartment. She drifted toward the back hallway, whispering the shapes of rooms under her breath as she pointed to each one in order. 

“Bathroom… hall closet… spare room… where was I…”

Then she stopped.

The tall, darkened doorway frame that led into her spare bedroom loomed in the short distance from her, but someone was standing in the frame. Not clearly. Just a silhouette. Her breath hitched. Not in fear, but in recognition.

“Is it…is that you?” she whispered, voice trembling with hope. “Baby…?” She stepped closer to the door.
“Son?”

The figure slipped into the room without sound, and she followed, drawn by something deep in her bones.

The moment she stepped through the doorway, the room changed.

The beige carpet brightened into blue carpet, the one that he had her and his dad install when he was twelve. The ribbons of accomplishments and the posters of half remembered bands appeared tacked onto the white plaster walls. A suit jacket hung on the door.

And he was there, beautiful, alive, standing in front of the mirror with nervous, fumbling hands trying to fix a tie.

“Mom,” he said, laughing lightly. “I can’t get this stupid thing right.”

She felt tears gather instantly as motherly instincts took over and she moved over to stand before the frame of her son. 
“Oh…oh, sweetheart, here. Let me.”
Her hands moved automatically, fixing the knot like she’d done a hundred times before.

He swallowed hard. “Thanks mom.”
He let out a long breathy sigh that seemed, at least to her, to hold more weight and a lingering hollow feeling hidden within it.
“This is it, mom. I’m leaving.”

“What? Leaving? Son, what are you…what do you mean?”

He touched her arm gently, smiling through something she couldn’t understand. “I have to go.”

The form of her son hugged her, released, and walked toward the doorway as his edges began to break apart. He smiled. That same smile that he had given her so many times when she had him in her life. The kind that says, “I love you,” without any words needed.
His shirt faded first, then his hands, then his face.
He gave her one more soft, heartbreaking look, and vanished.

The room dissolved around her like melting paper. She blinked. She was alone in a dim spare bedroom she barely recognized.

“What…what was I doing in here?”
Her voice was small.

She backed into the hallway when the smell of saltwater pushed past her. The sounds of gulls calling through breezy air and the subtle crash of waves started to etch their echoes around the room. She turned toward a framed photo on the wall. One of two young women laughing at the beach. She stared at the picture feeling cool wind and warm sun beams on her skin when, suddenly, a hand rested gently on her shoulder. She turned.

A woman in her mid thirties stood beside her. She was vibrant and lovely wearing a huge straw hat, a yellow sunflower patterned sundress and huge mirror framed sunglasses that reflected the image of the older woman. 
Her best friend.
The old woman stood there, looking at her, sunlit and smiling, the way she always was and always would be to her, when she was in her thirties. “It’s beautiful here, isn’t it?” the image murmured. The older woman’s breath shuddered.

“I miss you,” she whispered. “I…I have missed you. Where did you go?” Her friend nodded softly. 

“Oh no baby, I didn’t go anywhere. I was here. Just buried in so much noise that it took me this long to cut through it all and see you one last time.”
They both gave each other an embrace that felt like reuniting and never leaving all at once. That is until the words her friend just said bent back around to the forefront of her mind.
“One last time? What do you mean?” She said, hands still gripping her friend as she pushes back seeing her reflection again in the sunglasses hanging on her face. 
“Sadly, I can’t stay. And neither can you my dear. You have to go back, and I…well I just have to go.”

“What do you mean? Go where?”

“I’m sorry,” her friend whispered, the voice already fading. “I don’t want to, but I must go. And you do too.” The sunlight dimmed. The warmth dissolved. The beach unraveled.

She blinked, and the photo in her hands was empty. Empty of meaning. Just a frame with nothing inside. Nothing inside that she remembered. 

She stood inside the hallway holding a meaningless trinket that didn’t even garner a longing glance from her eyes as a new scent reached her next.
Coffee, strong, warm, familiar. A tall, trembling shadow passed through the kitchen doorway.
Her heart lurched, as she placed the frame that pictured someone she didn’t know down on the end table. 

“No,” she whispered. “No… it can’t be…” She steadied herself on the wall, shuffling toward the kitchen, guided more by fear than curiosity. She turned the corner, and the room shifted.

Her husband’s favorite mug was on the counter. The old coffeemaker sputtered softly. He stood there, aging face full of love and sadness.

“Honey,” he said warmly. “Sit down. I’ll make you a cup.”

She obliged him, she always did and she collapsed into the chair like it was the only solid thing in the world as he walked slowly over to bring her a fresh cup, setting it on the table beside her.  He knelt down next to her, taking the hand of his one and only love into his. 

“I need to tell you something.”

She swallowed, nodding.

“I loved you. Have always loved you. Every day. From the moment we met, to our wedding, to the day our son was born. Through everything. Even after the world took him from us. Took me away from you.”
Her lip trembled. “Loved? Do you not, right now? Love me?”
He glanced with a smile at her saddened expression holding a smile she remembered from a half faded memory. “Oh honey,” he said softly, “I have loved, love, and will love you always. Even when there isn’t a remnant of me that remains, my love will.” 
They both stared in each other’s eyes for a solid beat of time. Their ageless longing for each other never subsided and never wained. Yet, his next impulse was not his choice, he had no decision to make here, only the act. He stood, “But now, my love, I must leave you. Even though I wish nothing more than to stay.”
“Then don’t go,” she begged. “Please don’t go.”

His thumb brushed over her fingers, warm, familiar, heartbreaking.

“I have to,” he whispered. “And soon you won’t remember I was even here, or why this hurts to begin with.”

“No, if you leave me…I…how will I find you? How would I ever learn to live without you?”

He kissed her hand one last time.

“Baby,” he hesitated as he stood and looked at her, as if trying to take in all of her, every molecule, “I’m not even here now sweetie.”

“I’m…I don’t understand.”

His outline thinned.
His eyes faded.
His voice disappeared.
And the kitchen snapped back into the dim, modern space she lived in.
She stared at a cold coffee mug covered in a thin layer of dust that sat on the table.

“Why… why am I crying?” she whispered, touching her wet cheeks with shaking fingers. She began wiping them away, with no recollection of even why they were there in the first place. 

As she sat rubbing her palms down her cheeks she immediately froze with her hands halfway between her eyes and jawline. The smell that coalesced in the air fired off neurons in her brain bringing forth a long dormant memory. She couldn’t connect the dots in her weary mind of why it was here but she knew every particle of the scent and exactly from what place it belonged to.

It was floral, it was sweet and it was covered in love as it floated past her, filling her nostrils as if begging her to come find it. 

She slowly rose from the chair in her barren kitchen and walked out into the living room. The space did not resemble the current drab living arrangements of her own apartment but instead looked like a memory long pushed into recesses so deep that the sight of her new surroundings felt like an old lover wrapping her in a warm embrace. 

Warm firelight flickered on polished wood floors. Flowers glowing with color in pots arranged on the mantle and window sills brought a bursting of color to entire room. The memory took shape as the space that once occupied the area slowly gave way to the powerful image of where she was, had been, and held steady and exact. 
 
A cottage.
Soft. Safe.
That long forgotten place.
Home.

Standing behind a brushed brown colored couch were the vague silhouettes of far forgotten outlines of people she couldn’t quite place. Frames of vapor that seemed to hold shapes of only ages. Young, vibrant, loving. They stood without motion…watching her, waiting.

She walked over, stood tentatively before the outlines, squinting her eyes as if trying to gain an inkling of a reminder of what they are, who they are, or were, or should be. She blinked rubbed her eyes and felt her body ache and turned slowly before the feeling of fatigue grabbed her and she took a seat with a sigh on the sofa. Her hands stretched over the fabric of the cushions the material edging around her fingertips as a smile found its place. She hadn’t sat here in so long but she knew every detail. 

Then, delicate, soft footsteps interrupted the somber remembrance. 
A presence warm like sunlight entered the cozy cottage from a life she once knew. 
A beautiful young woman stepped from the shadows.
Confident.
Alive.
Gentle.

“Hey there, sweetheart,” it said softly. “I’m here.”

The old woman’s lips parted.
“I… I know you. I’m…you’re…me?”

“That’s right,” the younger self whispered, kneeling in front of her. “Hey there, lovely.”

She took the old woman’s hand in both of hers. She clasped them ever so gently before looking up to meet her own gaze. 

And then she spoke.

“Hey… look at me. I’m right here. I’m the last piece of you left, you know. Everyone else…the memories, the people, the moments you loved…they’ve already gone.
And now it’s just us. Just you and me. I wish you hadn’t had to grow old without them.
Without me.
I didn’t want you to carry everything alone. But you did. For so long. Longer than any heart should have to.
You’re scared.
I know.
But you’ve been scared for years, haven’t you? Trying so hard to hold on when your own mind kept turning against you. Your memory failing you piece by piece…like an ever present, slow moving coup,
quiet and patient, taking your life one room at a time while you stood there helpless.
Trying to remember faces that should’ve been impossible to forget. Trying to stay here…even when here stopped making sense.
I’m sorry.
I’m so, so sorry you had to do all of this by yourself. You don’t deserve this kind of ending. This slow unmaking. You deserved warmth, and company, and someone to tell you it’s alright when the lights go out. But this is where we are.
You and me, in the last quiet corner of your mind.
And…I need you to hear something.
When I go, there won’t be anything left to fear. There won’t be anything left to hurt you. There won’t be anything left at all.
But you won’t feel alone.
I promise.
There will be nothing left inside you to feel lonely with. Please don’t cry…you’re forgetting me already.
See? You’re looking right through me. I’m fading even as you try to hold on.
You weren’t supposed to watch me disappear. I was supposed to be the one who lived. Lived on through you. But it’s all going backwards now.
When I’m gone… you’ll be safe. Empty, but safe.
And I hope…
God, I hope…
some small part of you remembers that someone once loved you. Even if it was only me. Even if it was only the girl you used to be.”

The figures behind her faded first, softly, quietly, like dust settling.

Then her younger self, her last memory, the last bit of her, 
smiled through tears and whispered, “Goodbye, sweetheart. I love you.”

And she dissolved like smoke blown apart by a breeze.

The cottage room snapped back into her dim apartment. The old woman sat alone on the floor, tears streaking her face.
She looked around, confused.
Lost.
Hollow.

“Why…why am I…here?” she whispered.

Then, softer:

“Who…who am I?”

Her voice broke into a small, frightened whimper. She covered her eyes with trembling hands, rocking in the silence. And only the apartment held her, empty, quiet, waiting, as the last of her faded into the dark.

“In the end, the tenant of 1E doesn’t leave, she simply disappears, one fading thought at a time. There is no finale to a mind unraveling, only the soft collapse of everything that once held her together until even the collapse goes quiet. When the last of her slips away, the building exhales and closes the door behind her. Another life reduced to gentle, devastating nothing, and added to the ever growing ledger. Next week, we climb to Unit 5C, where forgetting is a mercy the tenant will never be granted, because his memories don’t fade. They fight back.”

I’ve been mostly “eating” Boost to get the calories I need. I’ve only gained about 5lbs of the 40 I lost (I would like to get to where I was as I didn’t have much extra before all this). I think a lot of my troubles with regular food are psychological. I started by cutting toast (slathered in butter!) into strips and dipping them in my tea in the morning. I would give myself a day or two break because it felt like my throat was more sore after the toast. BUT, was it?! I decided to push through and have dipped toast every day - it didn’t get worse! I upped the amount of toast to match the calories of one Boost and that’s been going great. 

I went to a pie shop this weekend with my wife which was a real treat - not just the pie but getting out and eating in public as I’ve been home every day feeling sorry for myself. I had a gingerbread cream pie and even ate a good amount of the thick and hard cookie crust! It took a lot of water and coffee and especially time, but I did it! Since, I’m down to about 2 Boosts a day (from 5) and my throat is not getting worse. I realize the journey is not linear so if I have to dial it back again I will but I won’t wait too long before I test how much I can take again. 

Why did I write this? I guess the food thing has been so hard I wanted to share a victory. I’m also sure there must be others who are in a similar place. I never thought that six months after finishing treatment I’d still be struggling with solid food. Good eating everyone and good luck!",6,1764814213.0,HeadandNeckCancer,4,1.0,False

**hdfidelity presents**  
  
# *The Langley Directive*  
  
---  

# **Episode 5 — “The Black Bag Meeting”**  

The man from the Department of Energy arrived ten minutes early.

Which, in Langley time, meant he had already committed a major faux pas.

His name was **Dr. Collin Reese, PhD**, and he introduced himself twice before anyone asked him to. He wore a navy suit so sharp it seemed to hum, a flag pin so polished it reflected fear, and a smile that suggested experience only with very friendly PowerPoints.

“I’m your liaison,” he announced to the front desk. “For inter-agency energy-intelligence integration.”

The receptionist blinked.

“…You mean we’re being audited by the light company?”

Reese laughed too hard. “No no, much more exciting. It’s about nuclear… synergy.”

She handed him a visitor badge that simply read:

**REDACTED**

---

## **I. THE BRIEFING**

Inside Conference Room C, the inner circle assembled:

* Leonard Graves, seated, already bored.  
* Conrad Vale, standing, already smiling.  
* Denise Ward, observing, already winning.  
* Avery Lott, hopeful, tragic.  
* Nadia Quinn, filming it “for internal alignment later.”

Dr. Reese connected his laptop.

The first slide appeared:

> **THE BLACK BAG MEETING:  
> Cross-Department Collaboration for High-Risk Asset Oversight**

Graves leaned back. “Black Bag means covert ops, doctor.  
You’ve brought a canvas tote.”

Reese looked down. Slowly slid his bag under the table.

Vale jumped in. “Let’s give Dr. Reese a chance to outline the proposal.”

“Oh, I will,” he said eagerly. “I definitely will.”

He clicked again. A stock photo of a glowing power plant appeared. Then another. Then, inexplicably, a family of four enjoying a picnic.

“We believe American energy and American intelligence can be harmonized into a unified operational force.”

“…Like a band?” Avery offered.

“Exactly,” Reese said. “A band with clearance.”

Denise scribbled: *Uneasy jazz.*

---

## **II. THE OUTRAGE**

Graves lifted his hand slightly.

“And what exactly would such… *harmony* involve?”

Reese beamed. “Shared resources, integrated communications, a pilot-site partnership at a decommissioned plant in Nevada. We call it…”

He paused for effect.

> **Project: ATOMIC OPTICS**

Vale nodded like he’d already trademarked it.

Graves did not.

“You want my agency conducting intelligence operations out of a broken power station.”

“Not broken,” Reese corrected.  
“Dormant.”

“That’s what I call half the people here,” Graves muttered.

Reese clicked again: a map, a budget request, a timeline.

“At first it would just be a test site. Minimal personnel.   Select oversight. A soft launch.”

Avery raised his hand.

“Sorry, um… ‘select oversight’ by whom?”

Reese smiled. “That’s the beauty of an interagency partnership.”

“…No one knows,” Denise supplied.

He nodded. “Correct.”

---

## **III. VALE’S TEMPTATION**

Later, in the corridor, Vale walked beside Reese like an eager campaign manager.

“This is brilliant,” he admitted. “Joint control, modern optics, an evolution of intelligence itself.”

“Exactly. It’s not spying—it’s *infrastructure storytelling*.”

Vale stopped. “That’s… actually very good.”

“I workshop my phrases with a consultant in D.C.”

“Who?”

“Denise Ward.”

There was a long pause.

“…You talk to my secretary?”

“She has a very strategic soul,” Reese replied dreamily.

Vale felt something he didn’t like: the creeping awareness that he was not the only climber on the mountain.

---

## **IV. GRAVES COUNTERSTRIKES (GENTLY)**

Graves called a private meeting with Denise that afternoon.

“So,” he began. “What do we know about Dr. Reese?”

Denise smiled gently. “What do you *want* to know, Director?”

He sighed. “You’ve already run background, haven’t you?”

“I wouldn’t call it running. More… strolling briskly through his digital existence.”

She slid over a thin folder.

Inside:

* Three failed pitches to Homeland Security  
* A rejected TED Talk: *‘Is the Sun Technically Spying?’*  
* Extensive unpaid parking tickets  
* A blog titled “Power & Perception: Thoughts for the Future of Control”

“…He wants power,” Graves concluded.

“Don’t they all?”

He closed the folder. Thought for a moment.

“Make him think we support Project Atomic Optics.”

Her eyebrow arched. “Support it how?”

“Overwhelmingly.”

A wicked little smile spread across her face.

“At once, Director.”

---

## **V. THE FLIP**

By week’s end, Dr. Reese had been granted:

* An office (temporary)  
* A briefing clearance (temporary-er)  
* Staff (confused)  
* Funding (accidental)  
* A welcome memo from Vale (too eager)

But he also discovered:

1. The “Nevada site” was a windswept patch of dirt containing only a defunct vending machine.  
2. His “support team” was entirely composed of interns who thought he was a guest lecturer.  
3. The press had already dubbed him “The Atomic Whisperer,” a title he had never agreed to.

“And why,” he asked Nadia, “is the vending machine padlocked?”

“That’s Top Secret,” she replied. “Snickers is a major asset.”

---

## **VI. THE SCANDAL (SORT OF)**

A journalist uncovered old blog posts of Reese’s:

> “If intelligence were energy, I would be its radiant god.”

The quote spread. Opposition lawmakers barked about vanity.  
The Department of Energy quietly distanced themselves.

Vale watched the chaos unfold on a muted TV.

“This is bad…isn’t it?”

Graves sipped his coffee.  
“For you? Possibly. For me? Entertaining.”

“You supported the project.”

“Yes. Loudly enough to make it impossible.”

“…You sabotaged it.”

Graves looked at him calmly.

“No, Deputy Director. I let it speak.”

---

## **VII. CLOSING MOVES**

In a parking garage beneath the building, Denise approached Reese as he stood by his car, utterly deflated.

“Was it ever real?” he asked.

She considered. “In Washington, real is just a rumor with funding.”

“And what happens now?”

“You go back to the Department of Energy… and never say the words ‘atomic’ or ‘optics’ in the same sentence ever again.”

He nodded. Paused.

“Was Director Graves behind this?”

Denise opened the passenger door of her own car.

“Oh, Dr. Reese…”  
“…he doesn’t *need* to be, anymore.”

She drove away.

---

## **VIII. FINAL SHOT**

On the seventh floor, Graves and Vale stood looking out over Langley.

“You’ve turned him into a national punchline,” Vale said quietly.

“He arrived that way,” Graves replied.

“And what now?”

Graves looked at him.

“Now, Conrad… you usually strike back.”

Vale’s phone vibrated.

One new message.

**UNKNOWN CONTACT:** *“Ready when you are. Evidence attached.”*

He looked up at Graves — a man impossible to fully map.

Then back at the phone.

“I believe,” Vale said, “Six has just sent us its first line.”

Cut to black.

**TITLE CARD:** *SCANDAL IN PROGRESS. TRUTH PENDING APPROVAL.*

1pdnmua,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pdnmua,"Post RCT pain, currently in a different country and worried","Hello,

28M, non smoker and non drinker.

I had two cavities filled roughly 3 weeks ago and then went back last week Monday, where my dentist said she thinks the nerve on the back molar might still fade. Had a lot of cold sensitivity next and then she started RCT on Thursday evening. I was due to fly to Colombia on Sunday, and because I still felt a bit of pain (constant burning sensation, and as if my teeth were pushing against each other) I went to another dentist on Saturday before my flight - that is where the xray is from. He said at first he didn‘t see any problems and I should be ok to go on vacation. He called me later in the evening to say I should definitely take antibiotics with me because he could still see an infection on the xray.

I still have some pain circled orange on pic 3 which feels like it might be my gums but also if i push on the tooth with my tongue it feels sensitive. Also sometimes if i run my tongue over the blue circled area I feel sensitivity. The tooth that had the RCT done does not have any more cold sensitivity and I dont feel any pain on it (felt some when chewing for the first few days but avoiding it atm).

- Right now there is a constant burning sensation, not super painful but annoying
- I had a coffee today and I think the heat gave me some „bright“ lingering pain (not super painful, but very persistent)
- Ibuprofen did not really help with that lingering pain
- I dont have any throbbing pain or swelling

I‘m not sure if this is normal one week after the RCT and would really appreciate your input. Please let me know if any other info would help. Thank you!",1,1764813962.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

By the time the five of them abandoned the trail and ducked into the woods, their sleeping bags were soaked through, their phones were dead, and nobody could remember the last time they'd seen another person.

One spotted the abandoned house first. A sagging shack barely visible between the trees. The roof had collapsed on one side. The windows were dark and empty.

Inside, it was dark, dry and quiet. Too quiet. 

They lit emergency candles and camped in what used to be the living room. 

One wandered down the hallway. He found a door that wouldn't budge. Not locked, just stuck. The wood had swollen with years of humidity. There was a crack along the side, just wide enough to peer through.

He pressed his face close, one eye to the gap. Darkness at first, then his eye adjusted. Red. A deep crimson glow filled his vision completely, edge to edge.

He called the others over.

One by one, they leaned in. One by one, they saw the same thing, red. 

Nothing else. Just red, filling their vision completely.

""Everything's just red,"" someone murmured.

""Maybe it was painted that way? Some kind of darkroom?""

They speculated quietly. Old paint, stained wood, mineral deposits. Nothing made sense, but nothing felt wrong enough to leave. 

Eventually, they gave up and rolled out their damp sleeping bags. 

One by one, they fell asleep, though none of them slept well.

In the morning, the storm had passed. They left quickly, eager to be gone. None of them mentioned the red room as they climbed down the mountain.

The town wasn't far. They found a diner and ordered breakfast, grateful for hot coffee and normalcy.

The waitress was friendly, chatting as she refilled their cups. She asked where they'd stayed during the storm.

""An old abandoned house, in the mountain, not far from here.""

The diner went quiet all at once. Conversations at other tables stopped mid-sentence.

The waitress's smile faded. She stood very straight, the coffee pot frozen in her hand.

The owner came over slowly. His face was careful, neutral.

""The house in the forest?""

""Yeah. We just waited out the storm.""

""You went inside?""

""There was this room with a stuck door. We looked through the crack. Everything was just…red.""

The silence deepened.

Finally, the waitress spoke, barely audible, ""You looked into the room?""

The owner sat down across from them. He folded his hands on the table and spoke carefully.

""There's an old story about that place. No one knows if it's true."" He paused. ""People say…the ones who lived there…they say those people had red eyes.""

The group felt their stomachs drop.

Red eyes.

Not a room. Not paint.

Eyes.

The silence stretched long and cold. 

The owner stood and walked back to the kitchen without another word.



They'd pressed their faces close to that crack. Peered in, straining to see in the darkness.

1pdnl9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1pdnl9w/is_the_selfhelpproductivity_industry_an_example/,Is the Self-Help/productivity industry an example of biopolitical power establishing a norm?,"Forgive me if I am not using some terms correctly, I am not entirely familiar with all of them. 

I currently see the Self-help/productivity ""industry"" as a way for capitalism to establish a norm and then persecute anyone who deviates from it. For example if you are ""productive"", you are living ""correctly"". I see this in the form of YouTube videos and self help books which identify a ""correct"" life as one that is productive- a routine that usually looks like:

6am - wake up, mindfulness/meditation

7am- Journal on goals for the day, workout 

8am- breakfast with optimal ingredients for focus, begin work for the day 

etc, etc. 

My understanding is that the main purpose of this is to establish a norm or an ideal point to get your life to. Anything outside of that(waking up later, eating differently, etc etc) needs to be ""medicated"" or fixed. I see this in the form of books whose sole purpose is to make you more productive and establish a routine or a more optimal style of living(Atomic Habits), or ""Self Improvement eras""  where you ideally are supposed to go through some sort of transformation to reach an ideal state of mind where you are at your most ""productive"".

Also, any lifestyle outside of this is seen as ""unproductive"" or ""lazy"", even if that isn't actually the root cause. For example, if you are going through a depression and struggle getting out of bed due to some underlying mental health problem, it's just seen as being lazy, inefficient, and unproductive rather than what is really just a completely normal thing that people go through.  In addition, even if you are not going through a depression and aren't ""productive"" you can still be growing--personally, some of my most intellectual periods of growth were times when I was not at my desk grinding away at something but rather literally just doing northing. However, as this is deviant from the norm of ""productivity"" I would be seen as just lazy. 

Finally, I see this in pop science as well. I was scrolling through  the Andrew Huberman podcast and found numerous episodes dedicated to ""Maximizing Productivity"" or ""Optimizing Healthy Dopamine"" with tips and tricks on how to live a maximized productive life, e.g waking up at this time for your circadian rhythm, drinking coffee at exactly this time, etc. I feel like this also establishes norms and identifies anything outside of it as unhealthy.

Is this a correct understanding of biopolitics and establishing norms? Are there some things I'm missing out on? Thanks.",2,1764813844.0,CriticalTheory,0,1.0,False

The title is a question that's been on my mind for a bit recently and I wanted to gather some thoughts. I've been reflecting on the recent changes, both official and unofficial, of the MFMC and something stood out to me: they just keep conceding to society.

It's weird to covenant obedience to your husband as if he's God? Consider it gone.

Young adults hate wearing their garments? We'll take the sleeves off.

Church music is too traditional? Here's your very own Mormon Hillsong.

And many such cases. Regardless, it seems to me that the Church is so desperate to keep their young tithepayers (that are still ripe for producing more future tithepayers) that they'll give up what used to be significant pieces of the culture just to persuade them. My question is, how long can they keep giving up tiny pieces until there are no pieces left? I don't doubt that the coffee ban will be gone soon, then maybe garments are just for the temple, then who knows what else?

Relatively speaking, the church has not been around for very long at all. Even if it were to hold on for another 50-100 years, in the scope of human history, its existence would be a tiny blip (read: ""blink of an eye""). It has been punching far above its weight among other religions that have existed for millennia. Frankly, besides the remaining TBMs, no one would really miss it all that much.

It has never been easier to discover that which the church wants to keep buried. They got away with it for the first \~80% of their existence, but not anymore. Plus, the public eye is focusing closer and closer on the church; it seems like every month a new show or movie comes out that has the TBMs up in arms about someone ""attacking their faith."" The Gospel Topics propaganda isn't really moving the needle, and any effort that could be used to address or apologize for the truth is being spent attacking and debasing those who share it.

This is also to say nothing about the growing ""mormon shrivel"", and how only about 20% of the reported member population is actually attending anymore.

I understand that there is still a blockade of ancient traditionalists sitting at the top of the Q15, so nothing all that drastic is likely to happen until Hoaks and crew cross the veil. Point being, the church can no longer ignore the demands of the modern member and the breadth of information that is available to them. So, my question is this? Will they keep giving up little pieces until there's nothing left? Will they replace those pieces with new, more tolerable ones? What shape can a two hundred year-old, conman's corporation really take in the Information Age?",6,1764813612.0,exmormon,13,0.87,False

Hello there beautiful people! Winter is here, and I'm  looking for a platonic Cuddle buddy for warm snuggles and great conversation.

 If you're nearby or in the GTA, Iet's connect. I'm someone who enjoys the simple joys of life, like building a blanket fort, sharing a home-cooked meal (| love cooking, especially with or for someone), or watching movies and shows ( doesn't matter which languages!). 
I'm also into staying active- play basketball, volleyball, and badminton (if in Scarborough you can join my group every Sunday mornings and play badminton with good mix of people).

 If you're up for it, we could do some basic yoga together(l'm trying to work on my mobility) , or play board and video games. I'm open to taking the time to get to know each other first, whether that's chatting on the phone or meeting up in a public space like a coffee shop, park -whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable. 

While it would be wonderful to build a genuine friendship, at this point, l'd be happy just to have someone to cuddle up with. If you're interested, let's chat and share photos as we get to know each other better.

Specifically the coffee grounds. 

I got nothing. My face was slightly pinker for an hour or so afterwards, and that was it. No coffee grounds, nothing got darker, nothing happened. In fact, 2-3 weeks later I think I started seeing some new spots that I'm pretty certain they weren't there before, and which didn't go away even today. I was supposed to have my 2nd session 4 weeks from the first one, but life got in the way so I'm scheduled to have it mid-December. However I'm really worried about it, what if I get even more spots and then I'm stuck with worse skin than I started with? Not to mention the money that's basically going out the window with nothing to show for it. My concerns are superficial capillaries on cheeks, some old acne marks and apparently some sun damage that she saw with the Woods lamp under the skin.

Is there any hope that I'll see something (good) after the 2nd session? I don't know what to do. I don't know if BBL is the right treatment for me.

1pdnekz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pdnekz/really_sweet_but_cringe_guy/,Really sweet but cringe guy,"I (21F) haven't been dating for a while as I have only in recent months broken up with my now ex after 2 1/2 years of dating. Recently, a guy I met at a party once (21M) added me on Snapchat, because my friends gave him my username (not to my knowledge). He was really friendly and asked to hang out, which I agreed to.

Issue is he thought it was a date, which I was very much not aware of, but I realise that is also my fault because I maybe should've assumed, I just find it difficult to understand people's intentions sometimes because I am autistic. Anyway, as the day went on it became increasingly clear he thought it was a date as he kissed my hand at one point and put his hand on my leg.

I would also like to note that the reason I know we met at a party is because at one part of the day he said 'we met 9 months ago at this party and I've thought about you since'. Honestly weirded me out a bit and I probably would've left if I hadn't known him through mutual friends. My friend did say he was just very nervous and also probably autistic which i sympathise with but it was just odd.

Another thing was he kept insisting on trying to pay for everything for me which I felt was a little odd but my friends did confirm he is just like that with everyone because he has quite a lot of spare money. After we went for a coffee he decided to get on my bus w me rather than get his train which also wasn't my favourite and then as I was getting off the bus kissed me on the cheek??

I think he is just very awkward and there was no malice in it and when he wasn't being weird we did get along quite well. My only issue is, will he just stay like this? Even after a week of talking to each other he still says stuff like 'I'm so grateful to be talking to you' and goes on about how pretty I am. I think it doesn't help I'm not used to being showered in compliments but I also find it really cringe.

Also I'm not a miserable person, this guy literally says thank you for talking to me like every 5 minutes or something along the lines of my previous examples. It's just too much to the point it's annoying and I feel bad but it makes me uncomfortable

I have expressed this to him multiple times but he doesn't seem to take the hint and idk if I can deal with it forever. Maybe he's just nervous but I'm really not that pretty or anything special but he seems to just parrot the same phrases over and over at me. He has dated before as well so I don't even think it's that.

He also speaks like an old man which would be fine on its own but on top of being really cringey and thanking me and saying about how great and awesome I am every 5 min, it feels like someone is punishing me for something (/j)

Last thing as well is, he says slurs etc, which I really don't fuck with. But he said he'd stop saying them for me but like?? I don't know. I didn't know prior to hanging out with him he did but I'm not sure what to do now. Btw he does know I broke up with my ex not too long ago as all of us were present at the party when we met. I know I sound like I'm complaining a lot and he is really nice but I don't know if it's worth it with the bad stuff that weighs it down.",1,1764813342.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1pdnehx,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1pdnehx/she_thought_her_husband_was_cheating_she_was_wrong/,She Thought Her Husband Was Cheating. She Was Wrong,"I’ve been a private investigator for twelve years, and most cases are exactly what you’d expect . Messy divorces, insurance claims, people who want proof of something they already suspect. When a woman hired me to follow her husband, I figured it would be another routine job. A few photos, a written report, maybe a court appearance if things got ugly.

But the first night I tailed him, something felt off. Not in the guilty way most cheaters act, no nervous texting, no detours to cheap hotels, no obvious double life. He moved with a kind of purpose I couldn’t figure out. Every turn he made seemed intentional. Every stop felt planned.

I didn’t know it at the time, but this wasn’t a cheating case. Not even close.

It all started when I received a voicemail. All I heard at first was shaky breathing, the kind someone makes when they’re trying not to cry.

Then a whisper.

“Please… I think my husband is cheating on me. I don’t know who else to call.”

There was a pause, five full seconds of dead silence before her voice cracked again.

“He’s been leaving at night. He says it’s work, but he doesn’t take his laptop anymore. And… he comes home different. Not tired. Excited. Like he enjoys whatever he’s doing. Please help me, I need to know what he is doing.”

She didn’t leave a name, but the number was there. I listened to it twice, then called back.

She picked up on the first ring.

“H–hello?”

“Hi. My name’s Alex. I’m a private investigator” I said. “You left me a voicemail a few minutes ago.”

“Oh. Oh my God, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to call this late, I just”

“It’s fine” I said. “I’m awake. Can you tell me your name?”

“Marissa” she said. “I’m… I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said all that on a message. I just didn’t know how to start.”

“Most people don’t” I told her. “Listen, this isn’t a conversation you want to have over the phone if you can help it. Are you comfortable meeting in person?”

“Somewhere public?” she asked. “I don’t want my husband to know.”

“Public is fine.“  I asked what the closest coffeeshop was and told her we could meet there.

She said quietly. “I can be there in the morning. I’ll tell him I’m going grocery shopping.”

We settled on 9:30 a.m. When I hung up, I saved her number and the voicemail, then stared at my phone for a long minute.

Most cheating cases start with anger. Rage. Betrayal. People spit venom when they talk about their spouses. Marissa didn’t sound angry.

She sounded afraid.

I tried to sleep, but my mind kept replaying her voice. The pauses. The way she emphasized the word excited, like it was the worst part. Affairs don’t energize people, they drain them. They make them reckless, sloppy, tired. But excitement? Excitement comes from purpose.

That was the first thing that bothered me.

By morning, I’d barely closed my eyes. I showered, dressed, and drove to the coffee shop she mentioned, a quiet, independently owned place tucked between a pharmacy and a thrift store. The kind of spot where people pretend to read books while eavesdropping on everyone else.

I got there early and took a booth in the back. Habit. I like walls behind me.

At exactly 9:29 a.m., the bell over the door chimed.

Marissa walked in.

She scanned the room like she expected someone to leap out of the shadows. Her eyes landed on me, and she hurried over, shoulders tight, movements small, like she was trying to take up as little space as possible.

“You came” she said, almost surprised.

“You asked” I replied. “Sit.”

She did, placing her purse on her lap, fingers locked around the strap. That grip told me more about her emotional state than anything she’d said so far.

A barista came by. Marissa ordered a tea she didn’t touch. I waited until we were alone again.

“Tell me what’s going on” I said.

She took a long breath, steadying herself.

“My husband. He works in logistics for a warehouse. For years everything was normal, long days, occasional overnight overtime, nothing strange. About six months ago, he started getting calls late at night.”

“What kind of calls?”

“I don’t know” she said. “He’d step outside, or into the garage. At first he’d talk. Lately… he just listens.”

“The night trips started soon after” she continued. “He leaves between eleven and one.”

“What does he take with him?” I asked.

“Keys. Sometimes a jacket. Never his laptop. Never anything from work. He comes back a few hours later and…” She hesitated. “He’s happy.”

Not relieved. Not nervous. Happy.

“He hums” she whispered, as if the word itself was obscene. “Like he’s proud of himself.”

Goosebumps crawled up her arms as she spoke. She rubbed them without realizing.

“Have you confronted him?”

“Once. I asked where he really goes. He smiled and said, ‘You don’t want to know. Work drama.’ Then he kissed my forehead and went to bed like nothing happened. I know he isn’t being called into work randomly.”

There was no tremor in her voice when she repeated those words. Just certainty. And fear.

“What do you want from me?” I asked.

She didn’t look confused. She didn’t hesitate. She didn’t flinch.

“I want to know what he’s doing” she said. “Whatever it is, I have to know.”

I slid a contract across the table. She signed without reading.

“Don’t confront him again” I told her. “Don’t change your behavior. Act like life is normal. I’ll handle the rest.”

She nodded, stood, and left without finishing her tea.

I waited a minute, then stood to go.

That night, when their garage door opened at 11:42 p.m., I was already parked a block away, lights off, camera ready, tracking him before his tires even hit the street.

I thought I was about to expose a cheater.

Instead, I was about to follow a man into the darkest hobby I’ve ever seen.

He didn’t take the highway, and he didn’t go anywhere near the industrial district Marissa mentioned. He drifted along backroads like someone following invisible directions, never signaling, never hesitating. Every time I thought I’d lost him, he’d reappear at the next intersection.

At 12:17 a.m., he turned into a storage facility. A fenced in patch of metal buildings on the edge of town. One flickering streetlamp buzzed overhead, illuminating rows of roll up doors. Nothing about the place screamed criminal. It was too normal. Too boring. And somehow, that made it worse.

He rolled down his window, punched a code into the keypad, and the gate slid open with a cheerful beep that didn’t match the dead silence of the night. No bags. No boxes. No laptop. Just keys and a casual stroll like he’d done this a hundred times before.

I waited thirty seconds, then slipped inside behind him. I killed my headlights, creeping down the center lane until I spotted him halfway down Row C, standing in front of a unit marked 109. His shoulders relaxed as he lifted the door.

That’s when I heard it.

Music.

Not loud. Not distorted. Just… wrong. Classical, slow, delicate, something that belonged in a candlelit ballroom, not a midnight storage unit. It floated into the air like perfume, soft and elegant, the kind of melody that makes you feel nostalgic for something you never experienced.

I stepped out of my car, heart hammering, and moved closer on foot. The music grew clearer with every step. And underneath it, came another sound.

A voice.

Muffled. Strained. Wet with fear.

“Please… please don’t…”

I froze.

Someone else was inside.

Not a recording. Not an echo.

A living, breathing person begging for something I couldn’t comprehend.

Then another voice answered, calm and low, almost tender like a parent soothing a child.

“Relax.”

After that one word was spoken I couldn’t hear much until there was a break in the music.

After a long moment of silence I heard him again. This time, no words.

He was humming. Humming along to the same classical tune drifting out of that metal box, perfectly in time, like the music wasn’t coming from speakers.

 The metal door began to rattle open.

I tucked away behind the closest corner and peered out.

He stepped out, locking the unit behind him with a casual turn of the key. No panic. No guilt. He didn’t even look around. He just slid the lock closed, pocketed the key, and strolled back to his car like a man leaving a gym after a good workout.

And as he walked away, he started humming again.

The same tune.

The same rhythm.

The same impossible calm.

Whatever was behind that door wasn’t his secret shame.

It was his favorite part of the night.

I watched him as he left. When his taillights finally disappeared, I forced myself out of hiding and crept toward the storage unit. Each step felt heavier than the last. I wasn’t sure what I expected to find, a clue, a lockbox, maybe just proof that the music hadn’t been in my head.

The metal door was shut tight, secured with an old padlock polished smooth by years of use. I stood there staring at it, my pulse thundering in my ears. I leaned closer, listening.

Nothing.

No music.
No voices.
No breathing.

Just silence.

Not the peaceful kind.
The kind that feels like something has already happened.

My hand brushed the lock before I realized what I was doing, fingers trembling as though opening it were a reflex instead of a decision. I tugged, testing it, trying to see if there was any give. The metal clanged louder than I meant, echoing through the rows of storage units like a shout.

That was when I came to my senses.

I wasn’t supposed to be investigating a crime scene. I was supposed to be observing a spouse. Somewhere along the line, the job had shifted and I hadn’t noticed until now.

I turned to leave.

He was standing right behind me.

No footsteps. No warning. Just there.

I barely had time to inhale before something bright flicked in his hand and pain tore across my cheek. The cut was shallow, but sharp enough to blind me with tears. I grabbed my face, stumbling back, staring at the blood slick on my fingers.

The knife was pristine. My blood was the only imperfection on its surface, glowing under the flickering streetlamp.

He lifted it up, examining the red smear like a jeweler assessing a diamond.

“If you’re going to do surveillance” he murmured, “you should really bring a weapon or something to protect yourself”

I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t breathe. He stepped closer, completely calm.

“My wife thinks I’m cheating” he said. “That’s cute. She knows something’s wrong, but she hasn’t figured out what.”

He tilted his head, studying my wound with clinical curiosity.

“You have no idea how valuable you are. A private investigator, sneaking around. No weapon, no backup, no alibi.”

He smiled then. It was confident.

He lowered the knife just enough for me to see the dark edge, stained with my blood.

“I don’t even have to touch you again” he said. “If something happens, this is enough. Your DNA, my lock, your prints. You look like a man trying to get inside somewhere he shouldn’t be.”

My stomach turned to ice.

“You understand what that means, right?”

It wasn’t a question.

I did.

He stepped back, folding the knife away like he was settling the bill at a restaurant. His voice dropped to a whisper I felt more than heard.

“You’re involved now. Whether you meant to be or not.” He smirked.

“Continue to report to my wife. Tell her you’re still investigating. When I need your help I’ll get in touch with you. Until then, take care of yourself and keep a low profile.”

He turned and walked toward his car, calm, humming the same soft classical melody I’d heard earlier, like all of this was simply part of his evening routine.

The gate beeped as he exited. The night went still.

My cheek burned. My hands shook. And for the first time since taking this job, I understood something with absolute clarity.

He didn’t just want me to follow him.

He wanted me on the record.

I’ve had a diagnosed chiari malformation since around 2008. It’s a 8mm herniation. I was diagnosed as a teenager when I started having headaches one day that never really went away. My neurosurgeon at Duke didn’t recommend decompression, just monitoring since chronic 24/7 headaches were my only symptom at that point. 

In the years in between I’ve had it monitored and gotten second and third opinions. Found other diagnoses such as hEDS, MCAS, and dysautonomia. 

I work on a coffee truck and had a moderate fall in June on the truck, almost immediately I started noticing classic high/low pressure headaches so I contacted doctor Grant who heads the Duke Chiari team, they got me in for my first visit quickly and ordered scans, including flexion and extension scans. Then in the end of September I was working on the truck and slipped on the wet steps and landing on the steps right on my spine. After that everything got so so much worse. I turn my head wrong and I’m in suck blinding pain I almost pass out, I start gagging if I move my head wrong, my brain fog is unreal and I can’t make it through the day without at least 1 nap. I finally got my scans done and the scans showed not only severe crowding while my neck is flexed backwards but a clivo-axial abnormality and a very “floppy neck”. I’m looking for someone out there who has experienced this. They are starting me out with physical therapy bc it’s the least invasive. I just want to know what to expect with the PT and if I should get my hopes up that it might help and I might regain a semblance of a life bc I am close to housebound as it is and my central nervous system is fried at this point.

1. Kaiseki Yu-zen Hashimoto - I was the most excited about this place. I only had kaiseki once in Tokyo and I can’t find it anywhere near me in Chicago. Every single course was amazing was dead on what I had in Tokyo.

2. Pai - My bf and I love Thai food and we loved this place!

3. Dark Horse Coffee

4. La Plume - the vibe was nice and the food was really good 🤤 That French onion soup was one of the best we had. 

5. Ivy coffee - I had the ube latte 🤤

6. First Markham Place food court - this reminded me of food growing up in Hong Kong 😭

7. Hatch coffee

8. Some poutine at the Distillery District 

9. Richmond Station - the farm to table menu was amazing. Every single course blew our minds. We don’t understand how this doesn’t get a Michelin star.

10. Butter tarts at St Lawrence Market

1pdn853,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyPastas/comments/1pdn853/the_truth_that_no_one_believes/,The truth that no one believes.,"Morning. Tomorrow I will be sentenced for my crime. Tomorrow I will find out how many years I will be locked in a small room - probably with no chance of ever leaving it alive. They call me crazy and sick, but I had to do it. I... I had no choice. Otherwise she would have left me cold. This diabolical woman. My wife.

For ten years she had tried to get rid of me using the nastiest and most insidious methods. But I've done it now. She can't do anything to me anymore.

It all started when I met her in 2014. I thought it was love at first sight when we met at a bakery. She stood in front of me and it was over for me. She had enchanted me there. The first few years were harmless. I had repeated seizures, which were examined by doctors, but a cause was never found. We bought a house and got married. Since I turned out to be infertile, it didn't have to be that big.

I worshiped my wife like a goddess. I did everything for her. If she wanted something, I jumped. However, I was always an obstacle to her. She made me feel that.

Five years ago my health began to decline. I suffered from recurring stomach pains, seizures, hallucinations and other symptoms. But no doctor found a cause for it. I doubted myself sometimes.

The days went by and my wife made my coffee every day, buttered my sandwiches for work and insisted that I drink my tea in the evening, which she always brewed fresh. I obeyed her like a dog that had been trained for years. She loved to throw away the money I earned. There was no time for friends and family - or I wasn't allowed to have it. She told me that my family was bad and that my friends were just making fun of me. And well, I was enchanted by my love for her. That's why I obeyed.

This went on until a little book changed my life.

I had another one of those days where I felt absolutely miserable and had to call in sick at work. My wife, that witch, decided to leave me alone and went into town to satisfy her shopping urges. I was home alone. Then I noticed that my stomach cramps were getting worse again and went to the kitchen to see if there was anything wrong with it.

I opened the cabinets and saw everything - various dried mushrooms, plants, flowers and all kinds of powders. I had no idea about it and didn't pay much attention to it. However, I discovered a small book in a drawer that made my blood run cold. I opened it and it described how to subdue people through tricks and medicine - and also how to poison them. It was described down to the smallest detail: which plants have which effects, how doctors can't find anything.

I was horrified and angry. My wife...she wanted to kill me. She wanted to get rid of me.

I tried to calm myself down, but it was difficult. I thought about going to the police - but at that moment the door opened. She stood in front of me, completely horrified that I had discovered her secret. She ran towards me and hit me. I was so weakened by all the poison that I could barely defend myself. I tried to confront her, but she just laughed at me.

I threatened her to go to the police. Then she laughed even louder and said that they wouldn't believe me anyway. She suddenly hit herself and said she would tell me that I hit her - and people would be more likely to believe her. I gave in, knowing I had no chance. She took the book and burned it in front of me. This destroyed all evidence.

This woman had extreme power over me. I don't know how she did it, but I couldn't get away from her. I knew I had to do something - but I didn't know what.

The days went by and every day she made me feel that she hated me deeply. She threw things at me, caused me pain. And with her mixture she managed to make me absolutely defenseless. I noticed this coldness between us and my hatred grew more and more. This woman was hell for me.

She managed to stop me from going to work. When she had achieved this goal, she locked me in a basement room. Without windows. Without light. Just go to a dark, small room. Once a day she brought me tea and a meal. I started to come to terms with my life.

I believed it would end in the next few days. “She will achieve her goal,” I thought.

After two more days she came to me and asked if I had one last wish because it was about to end here. I looked at her and felt my inner anger. I asked if we could go to the lake again, which was nearby. She agreed but insisted that I drive as she didn't like that route.

She let me out of my prison and we walked to the car. I had trouble holding the steering wheel because my strength was almost exhausted. Three quarters of the way there, I told her that I had to go to the gas station to get something to drink for both of us. It was a warm summer day, so she agreed.

At that moment I had a kind of short circuit. As we drove, I thought about what I could do to free myself. And I had an idea.

When I got out, I grabbed a lighter from the driver's side. I went to the gas station, bought something to drink and a bottle for her. Back at the car I put both bottles on the gas pump. Then I took the gas nozzle, pointed it at the passenger side and squeezed so that the gas shot out. I lit it with the lighter.

I won't describe any further. It was very disturbing.

Firefighters fought for hours to put out the fire. The gas station clerk overpowered me and handed me over to the police. They immediately arrested me and put me in custody. They claim you can see me laughing on camera. But I would remember that. I was scared, I just wanted to get rid of this witch before she got rid of me.

A psychologist was called in. Any help came too late for my wife. I already knew the psychologist - he had been looking after me for many years. He tried to convince me that I was imagining everything. Same with my wife. He always talks about psychoses, about delusions. This man tried to take me to the clinic two or three times, but I successfully resisted. My wife had also told me to do that - and she never wanted anything good for me. They were definitely in cahoots.

Everyone thinks I'm crazy, but I know what I've experienced. This woman was a witch. And the only way to eliminate a witch is fire. And it worked.

My trial is tomorrow. They want to lock me up for life, followed by a stay in preventive detention in a closed psychiatric ward. They say I imagined everything. No mushrooms, no medicines, no powders were found in our house. But my wife or this psychologist disposed of them. I can't explain it any other way. They were definitely in cahoots.

Nobody believes me in the book either. A friend of my wife said that she had never seen any substances or such a book while we were cooking together. She claimed that my wife only had an old herbalism book that had symptoms of poisoning on some plants. She must also be involved in this conspiracy.

Now I'm sitting here in front of the prison psychologist's office.
And you also seem to be sitting here because you did something. Or are you innocent too? Did you also have an intrigue?

I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it all. Apparently my symptoms were figments of my imagination, so no doctor could find anything. At least that's what they claim.

Every night when I sleep I hear these screams from my wife. How she asks me why I do this. I should save her. I should let her out of the car. But no - I held the door shut with my foot so she wouldn't come out. Her screams still ring in my ears. And I have to say… they sound good.

My family also turned away from me. They now claim that it wasn't my wife's fault, but my behavior. They are definitely in on the conspiracy too.

If I'm locked away forever tomorrow, I hope you'll tell my story.
That everyone knows that I didn't do anything bad, I just defended myself.

I'm not crazy. Even if everyone says so. I know exactly what I experienced. I can't have imagined it all - can I?

1pdn5k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pdn5k9/really_sweet_but_cringe_guy/,Really sweet but cringe guy,"I (21F) haven't been dating for a while as I have only in recent months broken up with my now ex after 2 1/2 years of dating. Recently, a guy I met at a party once (21M) added me on Snapchat, because my friends gave him my username (not to my knowledge). He was really friendly and asked to hang out, which I agreed to. 

Issue is he thought it was a date, which I was very much not aware of, but I realise that is also my fault because I maybe should've assumed, I just find it difficult to understand people's intentions sometimes because I am autistic. Anyway, as the day went on it became increasingly clear he thought it was a date as he kissed my hand at one point and put his hand on my leg. 

I would also like to note that the reason I know we met at a party is because at one part of the day he said 'we met 9 months ago at this party and I've thought about you since'. Honestly weirded me out a bit and I probably would've left if I hadn't known him through mutual friends. My friend did say he was just very nervous and also probably autistic which i sympathise with but it was just odd. 

Another thing was he kept insisting on trying to pay for everything for me which I felt was a little odd but my friends did confirm he is just like that with everyone because he has quite a lot of spare money. After we went for a coffee he decided to get on my bus w me rather than get his train which also wasn't my favourite and then as I was getting off the bus kissed me on the cheek?? 

I think he is just very awkward and there was no malice in it and when he wasn't being weird we did get along quite well. My only issue is, will he just stay like this? Even after a week of talking to each other he still says stuff like 'I'm so grateful to be talking to you' and goes on about how pretty I am. I think it doesn't help I'm not used to being showered in compliments but I also find it really cringe. 

Also I'm not a miserable person, this guy literally says thank you for talking to me like every 5 minutes or something along the lines of my previous examples. It's just too much to the point it's annoying and I feel bad but it makes me uncomfortable

I have expressed this to him multiple times but he doesn't seem to take the hint and idk if I can deal with it forever. Maybe he's just nervous but I'm really not that pretty or anything special but he seems to just parrot the same phrases over and over at me. He has dated before as well so I don't even think it's that.

He also speaks like an old man which would be fine on its own but on top of being really cringey and thanking me and saying about how great and awesome I am every 5 min, it feels like someone is punishing me for something (/j)

Last thing as well is, he says slurs etc, which I really don't fuck with. But he said he'd stop saying them for me but like?? I don't know. I didn't know prior to hanging out with him he did but I'm not sure what to do now. Btw he does know I broke up with my ex not too long ago as all of us were present at the party when we met. I know I sound like I'm complaining a lot and he is really nice but I don't know if it's worth it with the bad stuff that weighs it down. ",0,1764812648.0,Advice,15,0.5,False

I’m hesitant to go as I have not had good experiences in ERs over the last few months. 

I’m currently scheduled for a CT myelogram on January 6 (about 1 month wait) at a local clinic.

I am also working through the referral process with Dr. Carroll at Stanford.

Context: 
I’ve had headache pain since August 27 of varying intensity. At first we thought it was worsening migraines but after a brain MRI in late October showed intracranial hypotension we are pretty sure it’s a CSF leak. I also have Marfans syndrome which points to a cause. 

Oct 28 I had an epidural blood patch that was unsuccessful. I was admitted to the hospital for one night and the anesthesiologist was hesitant to perform the blood patch. If I were to go to the ER again it would be with a different local health system. 

Spinal MRIs I had this week show large bilateral perineural cysts in the lumbar region and smaller ones in the thoracic region. 

Currently my head pain is around 2-4. With occasional episodes of increased intensity around 6-8. I manage it with caffeine, fluids and bed rest. I have been on leave from work for the last three weeks, but I am scheduled to return next week. I do work from home, but my work is also cognitively demanding so I am concerned that work will cause the headache pain to increase.

I also have significant back pain that only started to bother me more significantly after the blood patch. The pain is so bad it limits my activities. The fatigue is also awful, I struggle just to get through a shower or to go downstairs and make a cup of coffee.

Long post to ask what others think… the neurologist said “it wouldn’t be unreasonable” to go to the ER, but I have felt dismissed by ER doctors and I’m not sure I want to pay the copay to potentially have the same experience. Is it common to have the type of imaging I need performed in that type of setting or should I stick with my scheduled appointments and keep managing my pain from the comfort of my home?

1pdn24b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/1pdn24b/giving_advice_sennheiser_6_series/,Giving Advice - Sennheiser 6 series,"Saying the Senn 6 series doesn’t need an amp or DAC is like claiming instant coffee is basically the same as espresso. Sure, you can do it. Nobody’s stopping you. But let’s not pretend the results are remotely comparable.

The HD600/650 etc. were designed around being properly driven. They’re 300-ohm headphones that scale like crazy with clean voltage and a decent source. On a phone or laptop jack, they’ll play sound. But give them a proper amp/DAC and suddenly they stop wheezing through the music and start actually performing.

And here’s the kicker: nobody who has actually owned a real DAC/amp setup ever says, “Yeah, you know what? I miss running my HD650 straight out of my MacBook headphone port.” That person does not exist. 

The improvement isn’t some golden-eared, bat-frequency nonsense. It’s obvious. Bass stops being flabby and actually hits with authority. Dynamics go from “polite golf clap” to “oh hey, this has impact.” Imaging stops sounding like a smudge. The whole headphone just wakes up and remembers it’s actually good

People claiming an amp/DAC isn’t necessary are usually folks who’ve never used one, used a garbage one, or are deeply committed to being right on the internet at all costs.

The HD600/650 are 300-ohm dynamic drivers. High impedance = they need voltage swing to reach their intended performance. Most laptop/phone outputs top out around 0.7–1.0 Vrms before distorting. The Senns want more like 3–5 Vrms to really stretch their legs. Underdeliver that and you get rolled-off bass, collapsed dynamics, and distortion.

The Science

Damping factor matters. Your source’s output impedance affects how tightly the amplifier controls the driver. Phone jacks and cheap onboard audio often have high output impedance, which makes bass muddy or loose. A proper amp has a low output impedance,
giving you tighter, more accurate bass and better transient control.

Onboard audio shares its power with half your motherboard. You get inconsistent grounding and mediocre channel separation. A decent DAC/amp gives you: lower noise floor, better channel separation (imaging stops smearing), cleaner signal path (less distortion, especially at higher volume)

None of this is golden-ear voodoo, it’s just physics.

The 6 series scale with the quality of the signal. A phone DAC has 85–95 dB of usable dynamic range? A half-decent external DAC pushes 110–120+ dB. More dynamic range = more detail, more space, more “real.”

TL;DR:

Underpowering a 300-ohm headphone literally changes its frequency response, dynamic range, distortion profile, and bass control.",2,1764812376.0,HeadphoneAdvice,6,0.75,False
1pdn219,https://i.redd.it/e9b3s9z8d35g1.jpeg,Lagom P80 - first impressions,"A few days ago, I finally got hold of my Lagom P80 which marks the end of hand grinding coffee  for me since I got into coffee around eight years ago.

So far, everything works perfectly and the workflow is great. I’m getting near-zero retention and there isn’t really a need for RDT given the ionizer, RPM purge, and the knocker. 

As for the 80mm omni burrs, I haven’t had the chance to really season them so my overall impressions could change in time but I would like to give you my general observations for what it’s worth.

First things first, these burrs have produce a cup with a very gentle acidity that becomes more pronounced as the coffee sits on your palate. Very different from the pietro I owned where the acidity is one of the first things that hits you when you take a sip. 

In terms of clarity, I feel like it’s slightly above my my comandante though I would need to AB test after sufficient use of these burrs to draw conclusions. Definitely not as high clarity as a pietro, but still good for pourover.

Astringency/drying finish is very, very low and makes for an easy drinking cup and a very forgivable grinder.

Body is really good which helps the flavor linger on your palate for longer. 

All of this adds up to a burr set with a great finish, a great body, good clarity, and a balanced cup profile.

Lastly, I’ve found that you need to go pretty corse to get the best out of this grinder. I’ve found 7.3 a good starting point and I do 4-5 pour pulse recipes to compensate.

Feel free to ask me questions or to let me know what’s worked for you on this grinder if you own one.

I needed to rant- but I guess you can skip this:
The management here is horrible. I’ve had 3 managers so far and right now we basically have no manager. At one point, our fridge broke so we were using milk from the freezer that barely had time to thaw- and if you’ve ever tried milk that was half frozen, imo it tastes different and gross. I felt bad we were selling it like that. One of our espresso machines currently doesn’t pull shots right. The soap dispenser for washing hands never was fixed in the time I’ve been here. 
I don’t think food in the pastry case is properly dated.I was told the drain, which started leaking, was growing mold. Someone cleaned it but still. 
They promise a renovation but we haven’t got one. 


I want to quit but I don’t drive yet and it’s the closest place near me that I can walk to.
If I did drive I would be applying elsewhere and quit when I know I’ll be hired. But that’s not the case. 
Since I don’t know how to drive, I won’t have another job for a while if I quit. Hopefully I will learn to drive this summer since that is the root to my problem. In the meantime should I quit? My parents support me but I’ll miss the money. I make minimum wage anyways …

I have been debating on if I want to meet again or not. The main reason I do is because I have a lot of questions I want to ask him. I mainly want to ask questions about why he came to this decision so fast and why there was really no conversation talking about other options and stuff like that. I feel like it might also help me know how to better approach the topic in future relationships. The other part of me doesn’t want to meet up because I know that ultimately I probably won’t get much out of this conversation.

I know this lifestyle isn’t for everyone, I’m not pushing this on anyone I’m just saying I personally loveeee it!!! If you don’t agree with it, totally fine and feel free to skip :) I also know not everyone can afford this lifestyle, but this post is only about my own life.

Anyways, it’s not just being a housewife but I realized a few weeks ago I have everything I ever wanted as a kid.

I grew up poor, in Canada. I live in california now with my man who I love more than anything. 

Before I met him I worked in a factory, I hated it, was broke and my only joy was coming home and making dinner (I love cooking)

Now cooking is like my main “job”

I also have no real schedule and it is absolutely incredible. 

I’m so excited for everyday, which is insane because I used to want to die in my sleep so I didn’t have to get up the next day… every night.

Now I’m just sitting here, thinking how excited i am for tomorrow.

My agenda is just making breakfast + packing his lunch… then a coffee date with my best friend, a hair appointment for highlights and a blowout and then grocery shopping & cook dinner while I watch a movie. I’m also baking a blueberry cake, requested by my man.

Which is like the most perfect day I can think of. I got the house spotless today so no cleaning tomorrow. I love the hair salon, and I love grocery shopping and cooking/baking I love my man so muchhhhh. 

And I get to go back to the salon Friday for nails + a facial. 

These are the things I saw other girls doing as a kid and wanted to do so badly but my mom died and I had a single dad, so just never really got to do it/could afford it.. and now I can do it whenever I want

I don’t like to say this to people in real life because it comes off as braggy, but after being so depressed for years I just want to talk about it. I’m so happy!!!

So sorry if this comes off as bragging, that’s why I’m posting anonymously. I just wanna tell someone right now

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

1pdmt6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptexnet/comments/1pdmt6n/the_best_crypto_wallet_for_online_gambling/,The best crypto wallet for online gambling?,"If you’re into crypto gambling, one of the most underrated decisions you’ll make is **which wallet to use**. 

A good wallet can make deposits and withdrawals smooth, keep your funds secure, and help you avoid a lot of the headaches plaguing shady sites. 

You might play with a great casino, but if you have a lousy ewallet, it's all for naught. 

Here’s a breakdown of what to look for, and some of the wallets I think work this year. 

**What You Want in a Good Gambling Wallet**

Before we get into specific names, these are the features that matter when you’re using crypto for gambling:

* **Multi-chain & multi-crypto support** — Many casinos accept more than just Bitcoin, so a wallet that supports ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL and more is a plus. 
* **Non-custodial / self-custody** — You want full control. If the wallet keeps the keys for you, it defeats one of the main advantages of crypto gambling: privacy and control. 
* **Fast deposits and withdrawals** — Since gambling platforms tend to move quickly, a wallet that works smoothly for sending crypto and handles fees transparently is ideal. 
* **Ease-of-use & compatibility with casinos / dApps** — Especially if you’re trying out new casinos, you don’t want to fight with complicated wallet setups. 
* **Security (if you hold larger balances)** — If you’re storing larger winnings or playing high-stakes, having secure cold storage is a big plus. 

Now this is just my opinion but I think all of these are solid options and for different reasons.  

**MetaMask** 

* Very popular, widely supported by Web3 casinos, sportsbooks and dApp-based gambling sites. 
* Easy to set up and connect — making deposits & withdrawals fast. Good if you’re not planning to hold crypto long-term. 
* Hot wallets are intuitive for beginners or casual gamblers: less setup fuss than hardware wallets or complex wallets.

**Best Wallet** 

* Non-custodial: you control your private keys, which keeps things private and secure.
* Supports a broad range of cryptocurrencies — not just Bitcoin or Ethereum. Good if your casino accepts altcoins. 
* Built with casino use in mind — many gambling-friendly platforms integrate smoothly with it, and deposits/withdrawals tended to execute quickly in independent tests. 

**Hardware Wallets ( e.g. Ledger Nano X / Ledger Nano S Plus )**

* Hardware wallets store your private keys offline (“cold storage”), which makes them very secure — much harder for hackers to target.
* Best for storing larger amounts or “house bankroll” that you don’t want easy access to. 

**My Take:** 

If I were gambling regularly but casually: I’d go with **Best Wallet**. Solid trade-off between convenience, security, and flexibility. Easy to move funds to/from casinos, supports many coins, doesn’t overcomplicate things.

If I just want to hop into a Web3 casino or sportsbook for a session: **MetaMask** or **Trust Wallet** works fine. Easy, fast, and widely accepted.

Just my opinion of course and that + two dollars will buy me a cup of coffee. 

But let me know what you think.

    coffee is cheaper    
    and so is freedom    
    and most importantly    
    all the scars are theoretical    
    but so are the stars     
    so are the dreams

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

In regards to MBTI, I first tested as INTJ during my teens and continued to primarily test as it into my 30s. More recently, I sometimes get INFJ. I've also gotten INTP and ISTJ before.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

If my signal created resonating vibes with you, send me a short message about yourself or the things that make your life up. Let’s see where our conversation takes us.",1,1764811261.0,MBTIDating,0,1.0,False

**Departure**

It was all I could do not to immediately run out straight to find Cindy. But Sanctuary was important, and Cindy wouldn't be helped by my recklessness if I arrived unprepared.

We explored more of Sanctuary. The library, the kitchen, and the arsenal.

In the armory, we made a fascinating discovery. My Halberd, *Chain Breaker*, belonged to a set. The rest of the set was still in pristine condition, all arranged on a rack. The chainmail fit me perfectly. The rest, not so much. So I borrowed the chainmail shirt.

Of course, I kept *Chain Breaker*.

Nyla found a new sword, its blade incredibly sharp and light, shimmering with the same magic as the Keep.

We slept in Sanctuary that night, preparing to leave the next day.

As we walked through the outer gates, I said, ""Let's get to the edge of Sanctuary now.""

This time, no step was required. We found ourselves instantly at the edge, the border between Sanctuary and the Gentle Place. As we turned to look back, Sanctuary vanished into the Gentle Place. There was no sign it existed, except life seemed to be returning to the Shadow Lands. Green shoots were pushing up through the grey soil.

Skia whimpered, watching as life returned to her home.

Nyla and I tried to console Skia.

""We had it all,"" Skia said through sobs. ""And in our greed and selfishness, we lost it all.""

Nyla and I just held her and let her mourn the loss.

After some time, the three of us standing there holding one another, Skia dried her eyes. ""Thank you. I love you guys. Let's go find Paul's sister.""

Nyla took my hand. ""I need to stop back at the Kingdom. Tell my father and mother I'll be going with you. Is that okay?""

I looked into her beautiful eyes and replied, ""Of course. I want to see them as well. It's a long way to find Cindy. The detour will only add a few days, and then however long we stay. But I am anxious to find my sister.""

Nyla kissed me on the cheek. ""Of course. Only long enough to say our goodbyes and acquire what provisions we think we may need.""

Skia, excited as ever, said, ""I'm going to meet a King and Queen! And then we will find Cindy, Paul's sister. Just a few days ago I was afraid I would always be alone. And now I'm going on a great adventure with my family.""

**Prydia Solaris Rejoice**

Our trip to Prydia Solaris was uneventful until we reached the border. Scouts had evidently seen us approaching and reported our return.

Skia started her pebble-shaking growl. Although this time, there were no pebbles around. We were on a grassy field approaching a low, grass-covered rise about three hundred yards closer to the Kingdom that hid the city from us.

I asked before Nyla had a chance to do so. ""Skia, what's wrong?""

""People are headed our way,"" Skia answered me, her hackles raised. ""Lots of them.""

**Parade**

Nyla put her hand on Skia's shoulder. ""It's okay. It's just a royal parade. The thing about Prydia Solaris is they will use any excuse to throw a party."" She smiled.

Cresting over the rise, we saw them. First came banners and flags, then acrobats flipping and jumping. Then came the drummers and horns. It was the most interesting parade I had ever seen. Not that I had ever seen a parade before.

And right in the middle were the King and Queen.

I could see Nyla wanted to join the parade. She was bouncing on her toes, a huge smile on her face. I looked at Skia. She had the same look of fascination on her face that I felt.

I took Skia's hand and told Nyla, ""Go. Skia and I will watch.""

Nyla looked at us, like she was unsure.

Skia encouraged her. ""Go have fun! We'll be here.""

I thought Nyla's face would split if her smile got any bigger. Then she put on an acrobatic performance as she joined the rest of the troupe. Having tails to counterbalance, and extremely strong legs and light builds, all Cat-kin were natural acrobats. I may be biased, but I think Nyla was the best.

This didn't last long. She didn't forget Skia. Nyla gathered a few of the guards and had them provide space around us for Skia's sake.

Then she brought the King and Queen over for introductions.

The King and Queen were both gracious hosts as always. Once the Queen found out about Skia being alone for so long, she took command of Skia's well-being. She ordered guards to move our group further away from the parade, which had turned into a party. She then set up exhibitions in smaller groups so Skia wouldn't have to miss anything. If Skia ever seemed to get overwhelmed, the Queen would step in to give Skia room to recover.

The party continued until the next day. We didn't stay that long. Nikki met us at the castle. Smiling, she gave the Princess and I both a hug. After receiving directions from the Queen about ensuring we were all made comfortable, Nyla asked Skia to stay with her, then invited Nikki to join them for a girls' night.

I bid everyone a good night.

Nyla said, ""You just want to take a bath. I know you.""

Nikki and Nyla laughed. Everyone else looked confused. I explained it was an inside joke, and I assured everyone I would definitely be enjoying the bath.

Nikki said, ""I made sure your pallet is in its normal place on the floor. Oh, and I have your wolf pelt back from the tanners. It's in your room. They turned it into a kind of coat. It actually looks very nice.""

Nyla kissed my cheek and said, ""Good night, my smelly wolf thingy.""

We all retired to our respective rooms. After checking the wolf pelt coat, which was indeed beautiful work, turning the beast I killed into armor, I climbed into that wonderful tub.

**The Rose**

The next morning, I saw the good Doctor with Grenda.

""Doctor NeVar, how are you? And Grenda the Free, what are you doing with the Doctor? I hope you're not sick.""

Doctor NeVar smiled and said, ""We're both good. Grenda is my apprentice now. She is learning to be a doctor. She is amazingly good with the children.""

The exposed skin on Grenda's cheeks turned red as she blushed from the compliment.

Grenda said, ""Thank you, Paul. Thank you so much for seeing me that day in the field. Not seeing the monster, but seeing the person.""

""You're welcome. I'm so happy for you. It sounds like you found your calling,"" I said.

We hugged. Once we finished hugging, Nyla, Skia, and Nikki came down the hall.

When Nyla saw us, she said, ""Grenda the Free, how are you doing?""

After more greetings, huggings, and catching up, Grenda stood straight and tall. She showed us her rose tattoo, just above her right breast. You couldn't even see that there was ever a brand there.

We all complimented her tattoo. It was quite beautiful. Just like the gentle creature who bore it.

Doctor NeVar explained that he was actually coming to visit Skia to perform a mandatory physical exam. Skia looked like she was going to run away at that, but Grenda took her hand in hers. She explained that she would be there the whole time and that it was neither painful nor scary at all.

Skia seemed to calm down. Nikki promised to guide her to the kitchen afterwards where we were having breakfast.

**The Crown**

As we were eating breakfast, Nikki and Skia joined us. Nyla asked us all to come with her, saying she had a meeting with the King.

She was vague about the details, but really wanted us all to be there, so we followed her. But instead of going to the dining hall, where I was expecting due to my history with the King, we walked into the Throne Room.

Nyla asked us to sit. The King and Queen were both seated at the throne. Nyla approached them after being announced.

Bowing deep, she said, ""Your Majesties. I am formally denouncing my rights to my inheritance of the throne. I do this so that I may join our great guest Paul on his quest to find his sister and free slaves as he finds them.""

Before anyone could say anything, I jumped up and exclaimed, ""Wait, what? You can't do that! I didn't know you would have to give up your right to inheritance. I can't ask you to do that.""

Nyla looked to her father. He gave a nod, and she turned around and addressed me.

""It is not your place to object. This is my choice, and I choose it freely. I love you, my smelly wolf thingy. And I will follow you to the end of the world. I was never meant to be the leader of this country. I can't stand that nonsense. I don't know how Father does it. My place is next to you.""

Tears in my eyes, I whispered, ""Okay, my Princess. I understand. I love you too.""

Nyla turned back to the King. His eyes were shining with pride.

""The Crown accepts your decision as a free person,"" King Harid said. ""Your brother, Prince Kaelen, will take your place as ruler.""

1pdmljw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pdmljw/i_was_hired_to_catch_a_cheating_husband_i_found/,I was hired to catch a cheating husband. I found something worse.,"  




I’ve been a private investigator for twelve years, and most cases are exactly what you’d expect . Messy divorces, insurance claims, people who want proof of something they already suspect. When a woman hired me to follow her husband, I figured it would be another routine job. A few photos, a written report, maybe a court appearance if things got ugly.



But the first night I tailed him, something felt off. Not in the guilty way most cheaters act, no nervous texting, no detours to cheap hotels, no obvious double life. He moved with a kind of purpose I couldn’t figure out. Every turn he made seemed intentional. Every stop felt planned.



I didn’t know it at the time, but this wasn’t a cheating case. Not even close.



It all started when I received a voicemail. All I heard at first was shaky breathing, the kind someone makes when they’re trying not to cry.



Then a whisper.



“Please… I think my husband is cheating on me. I don’t know who else to call.”



There was a pause, five full seconds of dead silence before her voice cracked again.



“He’s been leaving at night. He says it’s work, but he doesn’t take his laptop anymore. And… he comes home different. Not tired. Excited*.* Like he enjoys whatever he’s doing. Please help me, I need to know what he is doing.”



She didn’t leave a name, but the number was there. I listened to it twice, then called back.



She picked up on the first ring.



“H–hello?”



“Hi. My name’s Alex. I’m a private investigator” I said. “You left me a voicemail a few minutes ago.”



“Oh. Oh my God, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to call this late, I just”



“It’s fine” I said. “I’m awake. Can you tell me your name?”



“Marissa” she said. “I’m… I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said all that on a message. I just didn’t know how to start.”



“Most people don’t” I told her. “Listen, this isn’t a conversation you want to have over the phone if you can help it. Are you comfortable meeting in person?”



“Somewhere public?” she asked. “I don’t want my husband to know.”



“Public is fine.“  I asked what the closest coffeeshop was and told her we could meet there.



She said quietly. “I can be there in the morning. I’ll tell him I’m going grocery shopping.”



We settled on 9:30 a.m. When I hung up, I saved her number and the voicemail, then stared at my phone for a long minute.



Most cheating cases start with anger. Rage. Betrayal. People spit venom when they talk about their spouses. Marissa didn’t sound angry.



She sounded afraid*.*



I tried to sleep, but my mind kept replaying her voice. The pauses. The way she emphasized the word excited, like it was the worst part. Affairs don’t energize people, they drain them. They make them reckless, sloppy, tired. But excitement? Excitement comes from purpose.



That was the first thing that bothered me.



By morning, I’d barely closed my eyes. I showered, dressed, and drove to the coffee shop she mentioned, a quiet, independently owned place tucked between a pharmacy and a thrift store. The kind of spot where people pretend to read books while eavesdropping on everyone else.



I got there early and took a booth in the back. Habit. I like walls behind me.



At exactly 9:29 a.m., the bell over the door chimed.



Marissa walked in.



She scanned the room like she expected someone to leap out of the shadows. Her eyes landed on me, and she hurried over, shoulders tight, movements small, like she was trying to take up as little space as possible.



“You came” she said, almost surprised.



“You asked” I replied. “Sit.”



She did, placing her purse on her lap, fingers locked around the strap. That grip told me more about her emotional state than anything she’d said so far.



A barista came by. Marissa ordered a tea she didn’t touch. I waited until we were alone again.



“Tell me what’s going on” I said.



She took a long breath, steadying herself.



“My husband. He works in logistics for a warehouse. For years everything was normal, long days, occasional overnight overtime, nothing strange. About six months ago, he started getting calls late at night.”



“What kind of calls?”



“I don’t know” she said. “He’d step outside, or into the garage. At first he’d talk. Lately… he just listens.”



“The night trips started soon after” she continued. “He leaves between eleven and one.”



“What does he take with him?” I asked.



“Keys. Sometimes a jacket. Never his laptop. Never anything from work. He comes back a few hours later and…” She hesitated. “He’s happy.”



Not relieved. Not nervous. Happy*.*



“He hums” she whispered, as if the word itself was obscene. “Like he’s proud of himself.”



Goosebumps crawled up her arms as she spoke. She rubbed them without realizing.



“Have you confronted him?”



“Once. I asked where he really goes. He smiled and said, ‘You don’t want to know. Work drama.’ Then he kissed my forehead and went to bed like nothing happened. I know he isn’t being called into work randomly.”



There was no tremor in her voice when she repeated those words. Just certainty. And fear.



“What do you want from me?” I asked.



She didn’t look confused. She didn’t hesitate. She didn’t flinch.



“I want to know what he’s doing” she said. “Whatever it is, I have to know.”



I slid a contract across the table. She signed without reading.



“Don’t confront him again” I told her. “Don’t change your behavior. Act like life is normal. I’ll handle the rest.”



She nodded, stood, and left without finishing her tea.



I waited a minute, then stood to go.



That night, when their garage door opened at 11:42 p.m., I was already parked a block away, lights off, camera ready, tracking him before his tires even hit the street.



I thought I was about to expose a cheater.



Instead, I was about to follow a man into the darkest hobby I’ve ever seen.



He didn’t take the highway, and he didn’t go anywhere near the industrial district Marissa mentioned. He drifted along backroads like someone following invisible directions, never signaling, never hesitating. Every time I thought I’d lost him, he’d reappear at the next intersection.



At 12:17 a.m., he turned into a storage facility**.** A fenced in patch of metal buildings on the edge of town. One flickering streetlamp buzzed overhead, illuminating rows of roll up doors. Nothing about the place screamed criminal. It was too normal. Too boring. And somehow, that made it worse.



He rolled down his window, punched a code into the keypad, and the gate slid open with a cheerful beep that didn’t match the dead silence of the night. No bags. No boxes. No laptop. Just keys and a casual stroll like he’d done this a hundred times before.



I waited thirty seconds, then slipped inside behind him. I killed my headlights, creeping down the center lane until I spotted him halfway down Row C, standing in front of a unit marked 109. His shoulders relaxed as he lifted the door.



That’s when I heard it.



Music**.**



Not loud. Not distorted. Just… wrong. Classical, slow, delicate, something that belonged in a candlelit ballroom, not a midnight storage unit. It floated into the air like perfume, soft and elegant, the kind of melody that makes you feel nostalgic for something you never experienced.



I stepped out of my car, heart hammering, and moved closer on foot. The music grew clearer with every step. And underneath it, came another sound.



A voice**.**



Muffled. Strained. Wet with fear.



“Please… please don’t…”



I froze.



Someone else was inside.



Not a recording. Not an echo.



A living, breathing person begging for something I couldn’t comprehend.



Then another voice answered, calm and low, almost tender like a parent soothing a child.



“Relax.”



After that one word was spoken I couldn’t hear much until there was a break in the music.



After a long moment of silence I heard him again. This time, no words.



He was humming. Humming along to the same classical tune drifting out of that metal box, perfectly in time, like the music wasn’t coming from speakers.



 The metal door began to rattle open.



I tucked away behind the closest corner and peered out.



He stepped out, locking the unit behind him with a casual turn of the key. No panic. No guilt. He didn’t even look around. He just slid the lock closed, pocketed the key, and strolled back to his car like a man leaving a gym after a good workout.



And as he walked away, he started humming again.



The same tune.



The same rhythm.



The same impossible calm.



Whatever was behind that door wasn’t his secret shame.



It was his favorite part of the night.



I watched him as he left. When his taillights finally disappeared, I forced myself out of hiding and crept toward the storage unit. Each step felt heavier than the last. I wasn’t sure what I expected to find, a clue, a lockbox, maybe just proof that the music hadn’t been in my head.



The metal door was shut tight, secured with an old padlock polished smooth by years of use. I stood there staring at it, my pulse thundering in my ears. I leaned closer, listening.



Nothing.



No music.

No voices.

No breathing.



Just silence.



Not the peaceful kind.

The kind that feels like something has already happened.



My hand brushed the lock before I realized what I was doing, fingers trembling as though opening it were a reflex instead of a decision. I tugged, testing it, trying to see if there was any give. The metal clanged louder than I meant, echoing through the rows of storage units like a shout.



That was when I came to my senses.



I wasn’t supposed to be investigating a crime scene. I was supposed to be observing a spouse. Somewhere along the line, the job had shifted and I hadn’t noticed until now.



I turned to leave.



He was standing right behind me.



No footsteps. No warning. Just there.



I barely had time to inhale before something bright flicked in his hand and pain tore across my cheek. The cut was shallow, but sharp enough to blind me with tears. I grabbed my face, stumbling back, staring at the blood slick on my fingers.



The knife was pristine. My blood was the only imperfection on its surface, glowing under the flickering streetlamp.



He lifted it up, examining the red smear like a jeweler assessing a diamond.



“If you’re going to do surveillance” he murmured, “you should really bring a weapon or something to protect yourself”



I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t breathe. He stepped closer, completely calm.



“My wife thinks I’m cheating” he said. “That’s cute. She knows something’s wrong, but she hasn’t figured out what.”



He tilted his head, studying my wound with clinical curiosity.



“You have no idea how valuable you are. A private investigator, sneaking around. No weapon, no backup, no alibi.”



He smiled then. It was confident.



He lowered the knife just enough for me to see the dark edge, stained with my blood.



“I don’t even have to touch you again” he said. “If something happens, this is enough. Your DNA, my lock, your prints. You look like a man trying to get inside somewhere he shouldn’t be.”



My stomach turned to ice.



“You understand what that means, right?”



It wasn’t a question.



I did.



He stepped back, folding the knife away like he was settling the bill at a restaurant. His voice dropped to a whisper I felt more than heard.



“You’re involved now. Whether you meant to be or not.” He smirked.



“Continue to report to my wife. Tell her you’re still investigating. When I need your help I’ll get in touch with you. Until then, take care of yourself and keep a low profile.”



He turned and walked toward his car, calm, humming the same soft classical melody I’d heard earlier, like all of this was simply part of his evening routine.



The gate beeped as he exited. The night went still.



My cheek burned. My hands shook. And for the first time since taking this job, I understood something with absolute clarity.



He didn’t just want me to follow him.



He wanted me on the record.",1,1764811094.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

“He’s been leaving at night. He says it’s work, but he doesn’t take his laptop anymore. And… he comes home different. Not tired. Excited*.* Like he enjoys whatever he’s doing. Please help me, I need to know what he is doing.”



She didn’t leave a name, but the number was there. I listened to it twice, then called back.



She picked up on the first ring.



“H–hello?”



“Hi. My name’s Alex. I’m a private investigator” I said. “You left me a voicemail a few minutes ago.”



“Oh. Oh my God, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to call this late, I just”



“It’s fine” I said. “I’m awake. Can you tell me your name?”



“Marissa” she said. “I’m… I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said all that on a message. I just didn’t know how to start.”



“Most people don’t” I told her. “Listen, this isn’t a conversation you want to have over the phone if you can help it. Are you comfortable meeting in person?”



“Somewhere public?” she asked. “I don’t want my husband to know.”



“Public is fine.“  I asked what the closest coffeeshop was and told her we could meet there.



She said quietly. “I can be there in the morning. I’ll tell him I’m going grocery shopping.”



We settled on 9:30 a.m. When I hung up, I saved her number and the voicemail, then stared at my phone for a long minute.



Most cheating cases start with anger. Rage. Betrayal. People spit venom when they talk about their spouses. Marissa didn’t sound angry.



She sounded afraid*.*



I tried to sleep, but my mind kept replaying her voice. The pauses. The way she emphasized the word excited, like it was the worst part. Affairs don’t energize people, they drain them. They make them reckless, sloppy, tired. But excitement? Excitement comes from purpose.



That was the first thing that bothered me.



By morning, I’d barely closed my eyes. I showered, dressed, and drove to the coffee shop she mentioned, a quiet, independently owned place tucked between a pharmacy and a thrift store. The kind of spot where people pretend to read books while eavesdropping on everyone else.



I got there early and took a booth in the back. Habit. I like walls behind me.



At exactly 9:29 a.m., the bell over the door chimed.



Marissa walked in.



She scanned the room like she expected someone to leap out of the shadows. Her eyes landed on me, and she hurried over, shoulders tight, movements small, like she was trying to take up as little space as possible.



“You came” she said, almost surprised.



“You asked” I replied. “Sit.”



She did, placing her purse on her lap, fingers locked around the strap. That grip told me more about her emotional state than anything she’d said so far.



A barista came by. Marissa ordered a tea she didn’t touch. I waited until we were alone again.



“Tell me what’s going on” I said.



She took a long breath, steadying herself.



“My husband. He works in logistics for a warehouse. For years everything was normal, long days, occasional overnight overtime, nothing strange. About six months ago, he started getting calls late at night.”



“What kind of calls?”



“I don’t know” she said. “He’d step outside, or into the garage. At first he’d talk. Lately… he just listens.”



“The night trips started soon after” she continued. “He leaves between eleven and one.”



“What does he take with him?” I asked.



“Keys. Sometimes a jacket. Never his laptop. Never anything from work. He comes back a few hours later and…” She hesitated. “He’s happy.”



Not relieved. Not nervous. Happy*.*



“He hums” she whispered, as if the word itself was obscene. “Like he’s proud of himself.”



Goosebumps crawled up her arms as she spoke. She rubbed them without realizing.



“Have you confronted him?”



“Once. I asked where he really goes. He smiled and said, ‘You don’t want to know. Work drama.’ Then he kissed my forehead and went to bed like nothing happened. I know he isn’t being called into work randomly.”



There was no tremor in her voice when she repeated those words. Just certainty. And fear.



“What do you want from me?” I asked.



She didn’t look confused. She didn’t hesitate. She didn’t flinch.



“I want to know what he’s doing” she said. “Whatever it is, I have to know.”



I slid a contract across the table. She signed without reading.



“Don’t confront him again” I told her. “Don’t change your behavior. Act like life is normal. I’ll handle the rest.”



She nodded, stood, and left without finishing her tea.



I waited a minute, then stood to go.



That night, when their garage door opened at 11:42 p.m., I was already parked a block away, lights off, camera ready, tracking him before his tires even hit the street.



I thought I was about to expose a cheater.



Instead, I was about to follow a man into the darkest hobby I’ve ever seen.



He didn’t take the highway, and he didn’t go anywhere near the industrial district Marissa mentioned. He drifted along backroads like someone following invisible directions, never signaling, never hesitating. Every time I thought I’d lost him, he’d reappear at the next intersection.



At 12:17 a.m., he turned into a storage facility**.** A fenced in patch of metal buildings on the edge of town. One flickering streetlamp buzzed overhead, illuminating rows of roll up doors. Nothing about the place screamed criminal. It was too normal. Too boring. And somehow, that made it worse.



He rolled down his window, punched a code into the keypad, and the gate slid open with a cheerful beep that didn’t match the dead silence of the night. No bags. No boxes. No laptop. Just keys and a casual stroll like he’d done this a hundred times before.



I waited thirty seconds, then slipped inside behind him. I killed my headlights, creeping down the center lane until I spotted him halfway down Row C, standing in front of a unit marked 109. His shoulders relaxed as he lifted the door.



That’s when I heard it.



Music**.**



Not loud. Not distorted. Just… wrong. Classical, slow, delicate, something that belonged in a candlelit ballroom, not a midnight storage unit. It floated into the air like perfume, soft and elegant, the kind of melody that makes you feel nostalgic for something you never experienced.



I stepped out of my car, heart hammering, and moved closer on foot. The music grew clearer with every step. And underneath it, came another sound.



A voice**.**



Muffled. Strained. Wet with fear.



“Please… please don’t…”



I froze.



Someone else was inside.



Not a recording. Not an echo.



A living, breathing person begging for something I couldn’t comprehend.



Then another voice answered, calm and low, almost tender like a parent soothing a child.



“Relax.”



After that one word was spoken I couldn’t hear much until there was a break in the music.



After a long moment of silence I heard him again. This time, no words.



He was humming. Humming along to the same classical tune drifting out of that metal box, perfectly in time, like the music wasn’t coming from speakers.



 The metal door began to rattle open.



I tucked away behind the closest corner and peered out.



He stepped out, locking the unit behind him with a casual turn of the key. No panic. No guilt. He didn’t even look around. He just slid the lock closed, pocketed the key, and strolled back to his car like a man leaving a gym after a good workout.



And as he walked away, he started humming again.



The same tune.



The same rhythm.



The same impossible calm.



Whatever was behind that door wasn’t his secret shame.



It was his favorite part of the night.



I watched him as he left. When his taillights finally disappeared, I forced myself out of hiding and crept toward the storage unit. Each step felt heavier than the last. I wasn’t sure what I expected to find, a clue, a lockbox, maybe just proof that the music hadn’t been in my head.



The metal door was shut tight, secured with an old padlock polished smooth by years of use. I stood there staring at it, my pulse thundering in my ears. I leaned closer, listening.



Nothing.



No music.

No voices.

No breathing.



Just silence.



Not the peaceful kind.

The kind that feels like something has already happened.



My hand brushed the lock before I realized what I was doing, fingers trembling as though opening it were a reflex instead of a decision. I tugged, testing it, trying to see if there was any give. The metal clanged louder than I meant, echoing through the rows of storage units like a shout.



That was when I came to my senses.



I wasn’t supposed to be investigating a crime scene. I was supposed to be observing a spouse. Somewhere along the line, the job had shifted and I hadn’t noticed until now.



I turned to leave.



He was standing right behind me.



No footsteps. No warning. Just there.



I barely had time to inhale before something bright flicked in his hand and pain tore across my cheek. The cut was shallow, but sharp enough to blind me with tears. I grabbed my face, stumbling back, staring at the blood slick on my fingers.



The knife was pristine. My blood was the only imperfection on its surface, glowing under the flickering streetlamp.



He lifted it up, examining the red smear like a jeweler assessing a diamond.



“If you’re going to do surveillance” he murmured, “you should really bring a weapon or something to protect yourself”



I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t breathe. He stepped closer, completely calm.



“My wife thinks I’m cheating” he said. “That’s cute. She knows something’s wrong, but she hasn’t figured out what.”



He tilted his head, studying my wound with clinical curiosity.



“You have no idea how valuable you are. A private investigator, sneaking around. No weapon, no backup, no alibi.”



He smiled then. It was confident.



He lowered the knife just enough for me to see the dark edge, stained with my blood.



“I don’t even have to touch you again” he said. “If something happens, this is enough. Your DNA, my lock, your prints. You look like a man trying to get inside somewhere he shouldn’t be.”



My stomach turned to ice.



“You understand what that means, right?”



It wasn’t a question.



I did.



He stepped back, folding the knife away like he was settling the bill at a restaurant. His voice dropped to a whisper I felt more than heard.



“You’re involved now. Whether you meant to be or not.” He smirked.



“Continue to report to my wife. Tell her you’re still investigating. When I need your help I’ll get in touch with you. Until then, take care of yourself and keep a low profile.”



He turned and walked toward his car, calm, humming the same soft classical melody I’d heard earlier, like all of this was simply part of his evening routine.



The gate beeped as he exited. The night went still.



My cheek burned. My hands shook. And for the first time since taking this job, I understood something with absolute clarity.



He didn’t just want me to follow him.



He wanted me on the record.",2,1764810997.0,creepcast,0,0.75,False
1pdmk5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crush/comments/1pdmk5d/he_made_a_design_for_me_i_am_freaking_out_a_little/,He made a design for me. I am freaking out a little.,"Okay, so, I posted on here about a guy I like but I wasn’t so sure if he was into me or not. 

We live in different states and met on a trip I did to his city to visit some mutual friends, we text a lot, he is very cool and stylish and attractive in my opinion(debatable if he is conventionally attractive or not). He is a graphic designer, coffee shop co-owner and social media manager and photographer. Very creative person. 

A little while after we met my parents went to his city and he sent me some expensive Japanese matcha cause I mentioned I love matcha. Big gesture, right? I think so… but still, no talks about our feelings and stuff. For context, we are 26F and 28M. 

Then we had a bit of an argument about modern dating and he told me that women who think like me end up alone in their 30s… so uncalled for, but okay. We stopped talking every day after that argument. I didn’t argue or snap back, I simply excused myself and didn’t reach out again. But he reached out again after a few days, but he didn’t address the argument, and since then our communication is on and off, with him being the one to rekindle the conversation. 

We have an inside joke about a gossip podcast where we listen to people’s problems and we do it under the impression that we just want to pray for them. And a few days ago he made a comment about that inside joke and I was like… ""yeah, go ahead and do the logo, I have a minimalistic vibe""… cue to 3 hours later and he sends me an actual design of the logo. With me in the middle, he did an illustration of me. I look beautiful in it, he chose to draw me with my natural hair (curly) instead of my usual straightened/blowout hair. He chose colors I like and added a little coffee cup. Since we live in another state, I doubt he memorized my face, so he had to look for pictures, and in my feed all my pictures are with straight hair and only 3 with my natural curly hair. I am sure he got inspired from one of those 3 pictures. And then he also told me he can take pictures of me for the podcast… ""his treat""… he said. Now, I am not a graphic designer… so, is this a labor of love? Or do you randomly just do things like this for friends?

But then again, after our argument he silenced my stories in IG and hasn’t reactivated them since. But he talks to me, and he does this ""gestures"" (the matcha, the design, the pictures, the banter, following MY church on instagram, checking in on my parents while they were in his city)… but then nothing else. No talk about our feelings, nothing. No follow up. 

And we’ve been talking for 3 months at this point. Our mutual friends say he definitely seems to put in more effort for me than his usual way of being with women. 

Do you guys think he likes me? ",1,1764810987.0,Crush,0,1.0,False
1pdmk3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pdmk3h/i_38m_met_someone_37f_in_the_most_awkward_way_and/,I (38M) met someone (37F) in the most awkward way and where things stand after 2 weeks – a bit of a long story,"Bear with me, it’s a bit of a messy story, and even I’m surprised when I look back at how it all got here from a 15 minute drunk chatter. 

My first time meeting this girl was pure coincidence. We ran into each other at a local pub deep late into the night (more like morning, 4AM); she was drunk as hell. we chatted, but she wasn’t in any state to remember much. I got her Instagram at the end of the night and that was it… She didn’t remember anything the next day anyway.

I tried to remind her of myself on Instagram. For the next 10 days or so, by luck, a very sweet communication formed. Nothing flirty or intense. Just two strangers enjoying chit chatting. She did not have the slightest clue on who I was though lol. I thought she was just another drunk girl that I could hook up with but she turned out to be the most decent human being I’ve ever met in the last 5 years or so. 

Then last week came the first date. We got along much better than either of us expected. We didn’t feel like two people meeting for the first time. Conversation flowed easily, we laughed, made jokes, and there was a natural energy. We spent 3 hours drinking ony one beer each, the conversation was that intense haha. That date (if it was ever one) gave both of us a real “this was good” feeling. And we explicitly told this to each other. 

The only off thing I ever had was that she asked the next day that if we’ll ever become great friends. I clearly said no with an inside joke (too long to explain rn). She was put off for a minute but conversation kept on never the less. 

Our conversations settled in nicely in the following days. She doesn’t flirt openly with words, but her actions, her vibe, her messaging style, it all sends signals. Or I am being delusional, I dunno. I am too not flirting openly, afraid to mess things up because I havent been in the dating game for some time (one night stands, hookers & booze lol)

Sending a video of her cat at midnight, a video of her POV watching a show late at night (showing me a hilarious joke on the show), out of nowhere stuff in the middle of a chat, is basically “I am sharing my current moment with you” move in my book. And someone with no interest wouldn’t bother. Even I didn’t bother sending stuff like that to her. Am I rite?

At this point things shifted into a daily-chat rhythm. She’s been initiating conversations for the past 4 or so days. The reason we can’t meet up easily is that we both are busy with work, plus during weekdays she’s 9–5, I’m 5–2 (I work from home in a US based company and we live in Europe). We only overlap on weekends. And even then, she said she’ll be more available after December 15 because of her work. She works even on weekends, i don’t know how but she’s that busy this month. 

Off topic, she has a wristwatch inherited from her grandpa and wants it to be restored. I am into watches and have a great watchmaker who can do the job. So I sent her a standup night + said that we can take her watch to the guy and later catch the standup. She immediately said “that’s a great planner speaking, we’re going!” But that is almost a month from now so I gotta sneak in more dates/events. 

Then I suggested cocktails for this week, but she had an MRI appointment on Sarurday. She has a long time tumor situation but it’s under control. Naturally we skipped that plan. Out of courtesy I said something like “I can share some part of your Saturday (MRI day) if you want,” and she thought I meant I wanted to come to the hospital with her, found it very movie-like, laughed it off, but in a sweet way. I actually tried to mean grabbing a coffee or something if she felt like it but didnt bother explaining that. After that the vibe went back to casual again. She sent another cat video, etc. always with those videos of her cat lol. Didnt respond for a long time and messaged me later tonight apologizing that she was at a play so couldn’t respond. Then went to sleep. 

Oh anyway I am going into too much detail. 

We talked about each other so much that night we met, so I am sure this girl is someone you’d rarely come across in this day and age.

What are your thoughts guys and gals? Am I misreading stuff? Is it looking to be a possibility? 

Need help! Or need to go back to hookers booze and blow just to keep my sanity. ",1,1764810983.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1pdmjed,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1pdmjed/an_honest_unsponsored_review_of_the_factory_cart/,"An honest, unsponsored review of the ""Factory Cart Building Block Set""","Hi!

Right up front, tl;dr: 6.5 to *very* rough 7 out of 10.  I'm honestly kind of disappointed with it, though I appreciate the ambition.

Okay, let's do this.  Why should you listen to me?  I've been building with **interconnected stud-and-socket brick systems** (avoiding the obvious comparison) for about 38 years.  I'm by no means a designer, but I've got some pretty solid experience following instructions under my belt.  On top of that, I was an FLL coach for 2.5 years (had to quit when COVID hit, sadly), so I think it's safe to say that I know my way around a studded brick.  I've also got 1600 hours in-game, at *least* 1-2 of which involved cart-based shenanigans.

Man I'm funny.

Okay so let's point out the obvious things and acknowledge that we're accounting for them:

* There's a very good chance that many, most, or even all of the things I'm about to say are things that happened because I am an idiot.  I'm not gonna sit here and claim to be exempt from hubris - so, if you also bought & built one and had a different experience, let me know!  I'd be thrilled (well....you know what I mean) to find out that I just got a kit from a bad batch, and everyone else's is indistinguishable from the name-brand stuff! :)
* This kit is not made with pieces from any commercial brand that you could find at a store, as far as I can tell.
 * As a result, you're not going to get the same level of quality that you would expect in the biggest obvious comparison - piece dimensions may vary more than you're used to, etc.
* The kit was *probably* not designed by professionals, nor professional-level amateurs (based on several points I'll raise below), so you should expect some weirdness and incongruities compared to what you're used to
* Honestly, I'm pretty sure the price-per-piece is SUBSTANTIALLY lower than the obvious comparisons, and they're trying to do some pretty neat stuff with it - I 100% respect that.

But.

There are some pretty substantial problems, some of which I struggle to understand the reasoning behind.  I'm gonna break this into 3 main categories: ""general"", which is the stuff that doesn't really fit in the other two; ""instructions"", for the issues I've got with the manual; and ""build"", for the issues I experienced with and/or while actually putting the thing together (more with the pieces or design than with the specific step I needed to follow).

**GENERAL**

* First and foremost, the motor is charged through a micro-b USB port. You know, that super-common connection that we all have a million spare cables for.  (That was sarcasm; I can't remember the last time I saw that kind of cable in the wild.) I'm *sure* there's a good reason for using that specific connector, but damned if I can figure out what it is.
 * Additionally, the slot is on the top of the motorized piece, roughly under the driver's seat - which is nearly inaccessible to someone with adult-human-sized fingers (like me), and even more of a pain considering that the orientation matters.  USB-C has its faults, for sure, but at least i don't have to worry about breaking the thing by pushing too hard when the cable's the wrong way around.
 * The cord is literally like 4 inches long.  Hope you've got a socket at *just* the right height!
* The remote requires two AAA batteries.  I didn't know that when I opened the box yesterday, it's not on the store page as of 5 minutes ago (as I write this), and there are none included.  I feel like that's such an obvious thing that there must have been a meeting in which it was decided to NOT include them and I am struggling to work out the logic - they're not expensive enough for it to be a price thing, so maybe it was more about the importing?  I dunno.
* As far as I can tell, there's nothing that suggests what sort of battery life I can expect per charge.  Not really a deal-breaker on its own, but it would've been nice to have that.
* I couldn't decide which of the other categories to put this in so I figure I'll just leave it here - the thing doesn't turn for crap.  The way it's built, it's a rear-wheel drive cart.  You press the ""right"" button on the remote, the back-right wheel turns forward, the back-left wheel turns backwards.  Press ""left"", and they swap.  I don't know how to easily solve this one while keeping it at least similar to the in-game cart - the obvious answer is ""tank controls"", but that's not how the in-game cart behaves. =\

**THE INSTRUCTIONS**

- The orientation of the build on the page constantly switches without any attention being called to the fact that it happened.  An extra step with a spinny arrow over the model would alleviate this.
- Maybe I'm just old (I am, but I'm not sure if it's related to this point), but I frequently had a REALLY hard time telling exactly where to place the pieces for any given step.
- You know how the obvious comparison company will tell you the stud length of flat pieces and axles?  Yeah, that didn't happen here, even on the steps that involved multiple lengths of either category at the same time.
 - Also, there are a LOT of odd-stud-length pieces, which feels unusual to me.  Not really a complaint, just a point of interest.
- The bags weren't numbered.  Listen: I grew up with the obvious comparison company not numbering their bags and then they started doing it and it was the GREATEST THING EVER - I cannot imagine why you wouldn't follow that example unless they've got like a trademark on it?  Which, even still, considering how alike everything *else* is....
- This might just be a design change from concept to reality, but the ""back"" of my motorized piece looks almost nothing like the same face in the instruction manual.
- There are a not-insignificant number of times where they say ""here's the however-many pieces you need, make this shape with them"".  It wasn't *difficult* for me, but I don't know where I fall in terms of experience with this sort of thing - maybe someone else would have struggled.  Just seems like it would have been easy enough to just add an extra, intermediate step or two, and make it not even be an issue.
- The steps weren't always in a needed order - e.g. step 40 is working on the back of the cart, step 41 works on the front, and then 42-49 go back to the back side.  There was no need for step 41 to be where it is - it could be taken out & slotted in between steps 49 & 50 and the process would feel a lot more continuous.

**THE BUILD** 

* Because of the aforementioned & acknowledged standards & quality difference, it was pretty common for me to encounter connections with too little or too much adhesion (pieces wouldn't connect strong enough, or would connect TOO strong and be a pain in the neck if I had to adjust them later).
* The obvious comparison company has a set of design rules that official kits are required to adhere to - everything from ways that are ""illegal"" for the bricks to interact with each other (e.g. you're not allowed to place the edge of a thin brick between the studs of another piece, even though you CAN technically do that and it WILL technically hold there), to rules about having structural supports.  Following these rules makes your builds actively better and avoids putting unexpected strain on the pieces (in the example above, the bricks aren't designed to take that kind of stress on/in those places and doing that can lead to pieces actually breaking and builds collapsing as a result).  Many of these rules were *flagrantly* violated in ways that they didn't really *need* to be:
 * The very bottom of the build has pieces with nearly no support
 * I kept thinking that eventually something would come along and reinforce the latest ""this feels kinda flimsy =\"" chunk; it was very rare that anything actually *did*.
 * There are almost no ""hard points"" you can use to squeeze two bigger assemblies (like, say, the room and the back) together, without risking popping something else off by accident
 * Unlike with the obvious comparison company, you REALLY have to push these suckers together *hard*.  I think I'm starting to regain feeling in my thumbs, but I can't really be sure yet.
 * The blue ""pool noodle"" on the left side of the cart?  Yeah, it just falls apart.  All the time.  I don't think it fits quite as cleanly as they want it to, and I can't tell if it's because I'm making it too snug (compared to the rest of the cart) or if it's *supposed* to be built with less-complete connections than everything else, or etc.  Either way, it's *really* bad - honestly, it's why I decided to write this post in the first place.
  * ""But how bad could it ACTUALLY be,"" you ask?  For the first time in my nearly 42 years of life, I resorted to *super gluing the pieces together so that they would stop randomly falling apart*.  I'm not proud of that, but that's where we're at.  In fact, I might even end up having to do that in several other places. :(
 * The side ""skirts"" that go on the bottom by the wheels - especially the one on the right side - *really* like to just come off the base piece.  Not sure why.
 * Similarly, the diagonal sides of the windows like to fall apart and/or off - these are probably going to get glued in the near future.
 * Similarly, the front bumper likes to pop off - possibly because it's built on a 2x2 surface that's only connected to the cart on a 2x1 rectangle (see above re structural support).
* Lastly, and this isn't *as* big of a problem as the rest but it's still frustrating - the driver's seat looks like it's intended to be a clever way to hit the power button - it's got an itty-bitty peg on the bottom and it's on a hinge.  Problem is, the way it's built doesn't have the itty-bitty peg line up with the power button (at least not on my motorized piece; this might not have been an issue if mine looked like the one in the manual).  Again, not a huge issue but it certainly contributes to the disappointment.


Now I'm a big fan of not just complaining without offering some ways to fix at least SOME of the problems you're bringing up - constructive criticism needs to be *constructive*, right?  So, on the off-chance that anyone from Coffee Stain sees this (or anyone who has yet to open/build their kit, for a couple of these), here's what I've come up with so far (in no particular order):
	
1. Plug the cable into the motorized piece before you start the build, and never, ever unplug it.
2. If the solid-black pieces were colored a very dark grey in the manual (instead of nearly solid-black like they are now), I think it would have been a lot easier to figure out where things needed to go.
3. A lot of the steps (especially towards the start, when there was significantly less to use as a reference) would have been easier to read if they were instead 2-parters - a before, with arrows pointing to 1-2 significant studs, and an after, with the new pieces in place.
4. Similarly, especially for the earlier steps, I think the angle that the model is viewed at should be slightly more of an overhead perspective - it would certainly make it easier to see where intentional gaps were being left!
5. You know how when you're assembling an office chair, the LAST thing you do is adding the wheels?  Kinda feel like maybe that should apply here, too, since the wheels are a squishier (and therefore less stable) base than a table or desk would be. And doubly so since....
6. You're gonna be doing a LOT more pushing-down on pieces than you think - or at least, I needed to do more here than I *ever* have needed with any kits from the obvious comparison company.  It would maybe be worth mentioning that somewhere in the manual or the neat card that comes in the box.
7. If there's a version 2.0, consider moving the USB socket (and power switch, for that matter - put it behind the rear bumper, maybe)?  If it had been on either the front or back, it would have been *infinitely* more convenient - honestly, I probably wouldn't have even mentioned it.


So, to sum up:  Much like my most recent builds, it looks pretty okay!  It's a very cool bit of kit, and I genuinely respect the ambition behind it.  Much like my earliest builds, though, it doesn't really perform - falls apart easily, things don't do what they're supposed to (looking at you, ""turn"" buttons), and it's kind of a mess.  I rate it at 6.5/10, and would advise that you *not* buy it if you're hoping to show off the R/C part because, at least by my experience, you'll be very disappointed at the result.

1pdmjcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooks/comments/1pdmjcz/short_gripe_china_kladde_blackred_notebooks/,"Short gripe, ""China Kladde"" black/red notebooks, changed to slick, painted-on design","I've been buying these notebooks for years, Pearl River, Kruz in New Orleans (RIP), couple of local gift shops. Some more from Pearl River just arrived, the binding & paper are good, I can't describe the cover difference & may have to photograph it.

Usually the covers are sturdy cardboard and the design is like bookkeeping ledgers. The material has a soft dull sheen, nice texture. I'll try to describe the assembly; the corners and spine are cut separately and fitted on, and the black cover put on over that.  Some older ones have tiny embossed designs on the long edges of the corners. 

I just received some from Pearl River, the binding and paper are fine, but the cover has been changed -- obviously to save $. It's glossy, more like slick, and the design is just printed on. (I felt like it was ""pastede on yay"" - I can see advantages, like if you spill coffee a lot like what I do) 

I'm going to ""alter"" them. Put on a collage, or do something fancy with psychedelic acrylic paints.

""China-Kladde"" is a style; some are made in China, others not. Mostly sold by Australian and German companies, Cumberland is a famous one (won't ship to US). They are used as [geocaching logs](https://www.cache-corner.de/china-kladde-a7-red.html) for their durability. 

I'm over-reacting? Welcome to the 21st century, etc. But here, I can try to describe a change I don't like and some people will understand what I mean. [grumble]learn to make them myself.[/grumble]",3,1764810926.0,notebooks,2,1.0,False
1pdmj6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyInLaws/comments/1pdmj6f/my_boyfriends_sister_is_giving_territorial_ex/,"My boyfriend’s sister is giving “territorial ex” energy, calls him her WALLET, competes with me over EVERYTHING, and I’m losing brain cells daily","My boyfriend (26M) and I (23F) have been together 4.5 years. His older half-sister “Jill” (30F) — same mom, different dad — recently reappeared in his life after basically ghosting the family for years. She moved out young, never reached out, wasn’t close to him growing up, nada.
Then she gets divorced and suddenly—
 ✨ RESPAWNS ✨
 with clinginess, territorial vibes, and drama turned up to 1000.
When I finally met her, I was trying to be wholesome, open-hearted, maybe even future-sister-in-law energy.
She?
 She immediately starts calling my boyfriend:
“my wallet.”
First five minutes.
 All trip long.
 Didn’t matter if it was a coffee, socks, groceries, a planet—
 “My wallet’s here!!”
And she says it IN FRONT OF ME.
 Like babe, you’re not even subtle.
The worst part?
 He paid for her AND her friends’ meals.
 And when he said, “It’s okay, I got it,” she leans back dramatically and goes:
“OMG guys, my WALLET is in town!!!”
 Like she summoned a sugar daddy from the underworld.
Then—because apparently embarrassing herself wasn’t enough—every time me and my boyfriend talked about something WE bond over, something cute we enjoy together, she’d immediately jump in like:
“Oh yeah we used to do that!! We did that FIRST. We were soooo close.”
Girl, you weren’t even PRESENT for like a decade??? Be serious.
He compliments me?
 Says something sweet?
 Here she comes—
 “SAME!! HE DOES THAT FOR ME TOO!! Actually he does more for me, haha!”
Sometimes she even adds a side dish of backhanded insult like:
 “Oh that’s cute for you!”
 “Oh yeah I was like that when I was… younger.”
 or my personal fave,
 “Skinny because you’re young hun, not because you actually work out.”
Thanks Jill, certified nutritionist of delusion.
She has this whole passive-aggressive personality Olympics going on.
 She'll act sugary-sweet around him.
 Then he walks away and she turns to me like:
👹 “Stay in your lane, peasant.” 👹
And I swear… she HATES sitting in the back seat.
 The way her face DROPS when she’s not in the passenger seat?
 Priceless.
 Not my problem, sweetheart.
 Those are girlfriend privileges, not “wallet abuser” privileges.
Wait—it gets better.
She kept telling me — alone, one-on-one — that “siblings come first” and “their opinions matter the MOST” and how “family comes before partners.”
 You know, casual indoctrination vibes.
Then later, in the car, she REPEATS IT AGAIN but this time in front of my boyfriend.
 Like she was reciting scripture from the Book of Manipulation.
I’m sitting there like…???
 Ma’am, are you trying to establish dominance or summon a demon?
And then the family trip from hell:
She BOOKED one room for all three of us.
 Even though we were paying too.
 Even though we assumed we’d have privacy.
 Nope.
 She crawled into our vacation like the third roommate nobody asked for.
Every time he gives me a compliment, shows me affection, or tries to have a moment with me, she bulldozes in and hijacks it.
 He said during the drive:
“Wow, this is our longest road trip together.”
Immediately she screeches:
 “OUR longest road trip!!!”
…girl… who is “our”?
 You weren’t even in the car.
And don’t even get me started on his mom.
 No birthday gifts.
 No Christmas gifts.
 No gestures.
 Meanwhile I'm over here giving thoughtful gifts like Etsy is my personality trait.
 I swear the women in this family treat me like a side NPC they haven’t unlocked yet.
The enmeshment is on another level.
 If he stays with me, the whole family groupchat activates like an alarm system:
“Are you working?”
 “Come eat.”
 “Come visit.”
 “See you tonight!”
No asking.
 Just summoning him like he’s a family Roomba.
And through all this?
 My boyfriend himself is a sweet, green-flag man.
 Supportive.
 Loving.
 Not like them.
 But he grew up in this circus, so he’s desensitized to their clownery.
He does understand it’s weird…
 But it’s like he’s hearing normal volume while I’m hearing surround-sound HD.
I love him.
 I’m good with him.
 But his family—especially Jill, First of Her Name, Mother of Wallets—
 is making me question my sanity.
What do I do??
 Do I set boundaries?
 Do I ignore?
 Do I accept that Jill thinks she’s his soulmate?
 Do I start bringing popcorn to family gatherings?
Because she’s insufferable and I’m 3 seconds from popping off on r/JustNoFamily.

1pdmiuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingHell/comments/1pdmiuf/only_lasted_20_minutes/,Only lasted 20 minutes,"So I went on a date this morning that only lasted 20 minutes. I (27 male) went on a date with a NB. We met on hinge and had be chatting on there for a bit. Gave them my number and Snapchat. Had been on and off talking through text and snap. Didn’t have like super serious conversations nothing deep. Asked if they wanted to go on a date and they said yes. They live almost 2 hours from me on the coast of Florida. Asked if they wanted to go to Disney World. They said yes (I work for the company so I used one of my tickets for them). We walked into the park and I said I needed a coffee. Waited with me in line, then they said they needed the bathroom. I waited for them outside the bathroom. Came out showed the this cool ass Shark Catfish. They told me that they get nervous on dates and they have an upset stomach. Asked them if they wanted to leave and go home. They said no. Walked towards the safari and it was a longer wait so we skipped it. Walked towards the Rafikis planet watch and she said she needed the bathroom again. Turned around took a few steps and they vomited outwards towards me (I was only a few steps ahead of them). It got a little on my neck, hair and bag. They felt mortified. The cast members working gave me a free shirt which was very sweet of them. They cleaned up at the bathrooms. I told them once they came out again that we can a) go home right now and I’ll drive them b) they can get an uber home if the don’t want to be around me (because I made them nervous). They thought about it and wanted to go home. I said okay and say I’ll give them space and meet them at the exit of the park (they have been before). Went to first aid and got some extra bags and ginger ale and crackers for them just incase the needed it. Then drove them back to my place and they left from there.

I don’t want to burden her with anything bulky or something she has to squeeze into her luggage.

so at first I thought about getting her jewelry something like  a bracelet but I realized I’ve never actually seen her wear bracelets and I’m not sure if she even likes them. A necklace or ring crossed my mind too but I’ve already given her those before so I’m not sure if giving her another one would feel repetitive… unless that’s actually fine? It *has* been a while since I last gave her jewelry.

I also thought about getting her some warm clothing that can wear for her flight back since she now lives in a colder state where it actually snows and drops below 30°F. But I’m unsure if that’s the right move either.

Her birthday was literally the first week of December, so I feel like I’ve burned through all my gift ideas already lol.  
  
What would you recommend as a thoughtful gift that’s not as bulky and still meaningful?  
   
***as for any ideas of shipping to her place, I do plan on shipping 1 small gift to her apartment (season themed Keurig coffee cups since she just got a coffee maker) but I want to give her one in person as well.***
