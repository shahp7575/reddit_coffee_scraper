I have been using Instagram for years—not just as a platform to share moments, but as a creative playground. Over time, I’ve come to realize that Instagram is more than a social media app; it’s a hub for self-expression, creativity, and even storytelling. What started as a casual pastime quickly became a way for me to experiment with design, color, and engagement in ways I never imagined.

Among Instagram’s plethora of features, some stand out as genuinely “cool,” the kind that make you stop scrolling and think: *“Wow, I need to try that.”* In this post, I want to share my personal journey discovering these features, how they changed the way I interact with my audience, and a few tips you might find useful—especially if you’re just starting out or looking to elevate your Instagram game.



# 1. Stories: The Real Playground

Instagram Stories have always been my favorite part of the app. There’s something magical about being able to share moments that disappear after 24 hours. But what really blew me away was how customizable Stories can be. From stickers and GIFs to polls and music, the options are practically endless.

One day, I discovered a feature that I hadn’t explored much before: customizing the background of my stories. At first, I thought it was limited to photos and videos, but soon I realized you could do so much more. If you’ve ever wondered [how to change background color on instagram story](https://www.searchenginemagazine.com/how-to-change-background-color-on-instagram-story), it’s actually quite simple—and it opens up a world of creative possibilities. You can highlight text, create mood-driven posts, or even design a mini digital canvas right on your phone.

For me, this feature changed the way I used Stories. Instead of just sharing snapshots of my day, I began designing mini-messages that were visually engaging. A single color could completely alter the mood of a story, making it feel playful, dramatic, or even calming depending on the palette I chose.



# 2. Stickers, GIFs, and Interactive Elements

Beyond background customization, Instagram’s sticker library is another game-changer. I vividly remember the first time I added a poll to my Story—it was simple, yet engaging. Suddenly, my audience could interact with me directly, vote on questions, or share opinions. The immediacy of feedback was exciting.

GIFs are another personal favorite. I spent hours experimenting with animations that complemented my story’s theme. Whether it’s a quirky sticker for humor or an elegant one for aesthetic appeal, GIFs make the Stories feel alive. These small interactive elements make Instagram feel more like a conversation than a one-way broadcast.



# 3. Highlights: Storytelling Beyond 24 Hours

Before discovering Highlights, I often felt frustrated that my carefully crafted stories would disappear after a day. Instagram Highlights changed that completely. By grouping stories into collections, I could showcase different aspects of my life—travel, hobbies, behind-the-scenes work, and personal milestones.

I remember my first Highlight reel: a collection of my weekend adventures. Using background colors and stickers consistently created a cohesive look. Over time, I started designing my Highlight covers in a way that matched my overall Instagram theme, turning my profile into a mini-portfolio of my personality and creativity.



# 4. Reels: Creativity in Motion

Instagram Reels have been another exciting discovery. Short, snappy, and endlessly creative, Reels allow for more dynamic storytelling than static posts. My first Reel was simple—a montage of coffee shop visits—but I quickly realized the potential. Transitions, music overlays, text animations, and speed adjustments allowed me to express moods and narratives in seconds.

The cool part? Reels have also helped me understand trends and audience engagement. Watching what works, what gets shares, and what resonates has been like a mini digital marketing lesson every time I post.



# 5. Advanced Text Features and Fonts

Instagram’s text features often go unnoticed, but they are surprisingly powerful. You can create mood through font choice, size, and color. I found that even small changes—like switching from a classic serif to a playful handwritten font—can dramatically shift the tone of your Story. Pairing these text features with **how to change background color on instagram story** made my posts feel intentional, designed, and visually striking.

This combination of text and color customization has become my favorite creative outlet. Whether it’s a quote, a fun fact, or a simple greeting, styling the story thoughtfully transforms it from a casual post into a mini piece of digital art.



# 6. Insights and Analytics: Learning While Creating

One aspect that surprised me was how much I could learn about my audience through Instagram’s built-in insights. Watching engagement metrics—like story views, interactions, and shares—helped me refine my creative choices. Over time, I began experimenting more boldly, knowing I could track what resonated and what didn’t. It turned the platform into a live feedback loop, where creativity met analytics.



# 7. My Favorite Tip for Beginners

If there’s one tip I wish I knew earlier, it’s to embrace customization fully. Don’t just post raw content. Explore features like:

* **Background colors and gradients**
* **GIFs and stickers**
* **Polls and Q&A interactions**
* **Highlight organization**
* **Font and text styling**

Especially, mastering **how to change background color on instagram story** can elevate even the simplest post. It’s a small tweak that immediately improves aesthetics and engagement.



# Final Thoughts

Instagram is more than a photo-sharing app—it’s a creative canvas, a storytelling tool, and a community hub. Over the years, exploring its cool features has transformed the way I connect with others, express ideas, and even think about digital creativity.

The ability to customize Stories, use interactive elements, and design posts with intent makes Instagram a unique platform where anyone—from casual users to brands—can tell their story with flair. And once you start exploring features like changing background colors or interactive stickers, you realize that the possibilities are nearly endless.

For anyone looking to get more from Instagram, my advice is simple: experiment boldly, learn continuously, and embrace features that bring your personality and creativity to life. Every post, every Story, and every Reel is an opportunity to create something uniquely yours.",1,1764583356.0,u_External_Reality3544,0,1.0,False

Girls have asked me in the past why I've not made a move on them even though they were ""clearly trying to flirt"", and other times (like today...) I'll be 100% convinced that a girl is interested in me but in reality they're not / they've got a boyfriend.

Lately a girl has been coming in every day and I always make her coffee / usually serve her. We always have a lovely chat while I'm taking her order/making her coffee. Anyway, I was 100% convinced that she was interested in me - not on the basis of having a conversation, but the vibes and her demeanour, I guess.

I'm thinking this must have been a case of me misinterpreting social cues, etc. because after getting her coffee, etc. she walked past the shop holding hands with a guy. This doesn't devastate me or anything, I'm frustrated because its another example of my lack of 'comprehension'.

Even with all the stitching, the gluing, the God-knows-what chemical cocktail Colby slathered on to make Tommy “whole” again, it wasn’t him. Not even close.

I’ve spent enough time around animals, cats especially, to know how a body is supposed to move. This thing lurched. A sloppy, side-to-side wobble, like a drunk toddler taking its first steps. Every clumsy shuffle closed the distance between us, and for one awful heartbeat, I got the sense it thought I was its mother, its anchor in the new world.

And that’s when the fear hit bone-deep.

I stumbled back, the cheap plastic curtain Colby had hung from the ceiling wrapping around my ankle like a dead man’s hand. My foot snagged, and I went down hard, flat on my ass against the cold concrete. The toolbox beside me skidded away with a metallic scrape, just out of reach, my fingers slipping uselessly along its smooth lid.

For a split second, I wanted nothing more than to snatch it up, swing it, and turn whatever scraps of Tommy were still shambling toward me back into the same warm, formless mess I’d scooped into a plastic bag the day before.

Maybe this time I’d bury him deep enough he’d stay down.

“What the fuck is that?!” I hissed in Colby’s direction, my voice cracking somewhere between terror and fury.

He just stared down at me with that crooked smile, half proud parent, half dog that knows it’s dragged something dead onto the porch. He watched me writhing in the plastic curtain like I was some trapped possum he’d cornered for fun.

“It’s your boy!” he crowed. “All fixed up!”

Fixed.

Right.

Whatever was stuffed inside the sagging skin of that fat orange bastard must’ve heard my voice. Must’ve recognized it, because its two bulging eyes shifted. Not in unison. Not even close. They rolled lazily in their sockets, like wet marbles floating in cold soup, trying to decide which direction reality was in.

One pupil drifted sideways toward the bridge of its nose, drifting like it was caught in a slow ripple. The other wandered across the room, scanning for something, maybe looking for me, maybe for Colby, maybe for whatever it thought was its owner or maker or both.

Up close, they looked like snowballs jammed into its skull by someone who didn’t understand how eyeballs were supposed to fit. A size too big. Maybe two. Definitely not meant to be there.

I thrashed harder in the plastic bear trap Colby called a curtain, and by some miracle the cheap material finally gave way, ripping under the frantic, ugly strength of pure panic. The second my ankle came free, I lashed out with a slow, lazy kick at whatever was pretending to be Tommy.

It didn’t dodge, didn’t even try. 

It just folded.

The whole thing slumped sideways like a sack of wet grain, one eye popping half loose from the socket it had never belonged in to begin with. And Colby, the mountain of fat that was him was dropped to his knees beside it as if I’d kicked his newborn child.

The scream he let out was so raw, so animal, that for one horrible second, I almost felt guilty.

“GIVE HIM TIME TO ADJUST!” he shrieked, voice warbling and drenched in snot and hysteria. “I PROMISE HE’LL BE GOOD-BRAND NEW!”

My hand shot out toward the red toolbox, fingers closing around the cold handle of a screwdriver. I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I just moved, a sudden animal burst of adrenaline firing through my legs.

Colby noticed instantly.

Apparently, I was more important than his masterpiece.

“Man, don’t be like that!” he bellowed, and I could hear him lumbering after me, heavy, clumsy footsteps shaking the floorboards like a predator with a limp.

I scrambled toward the stairs and bolted up them on all fours, the way I used to as a kid when I wanted to feel fast. But now it wasn’t exhilarating. It was desperate, messy, painful. My knees slammed the wood; my palms slipped on dust. I could hear Colby’s ragged breath right behind me.

Then I felt it, that sudden clamp around my ankle.

Wet, greasy, disgustingly warm.

It wrapped around me like something pulled from a clogged drain.

For a heartbeat I braced myself for the yank, the violent drag backward, my teeth smashing on the steps, the tumble into the dark where Tommy waited to welcome me to whatever afterlife rejects like us ended up in. 

But the pull never came.

He just held me there while I kicked and thrashed like a trapped animal. His grip was firm but trembling, the way someone holds onto the last valuable thing they own.

I twisted around, breath sawing in and out, and met his eyes.

Those wet, stupid cow eyes. Shining with a sadness so heavy it didn’t belong on a man his size. Like I was the only thing he had left in this world.

Something in me recoiled.

Without thinking, without even aiming, I swung the screwdriver down and drove it straight into his hand.

It slid in almost too easily, like his skin had just been waiting to split.

There was a soft, sickening give as metal punched through muscle.

Colby’s grip vanished instantly.

He howled and staggered backward trying to catch onto anything as he fell down, his fat fingers sliding off the walls of the basement.

And as he fell, a quiet, shameful part of me hoped the concrete would finish what I couldn’t, snap his neck, crack his skull, silence him for good.

I didn’t hear a break or a thud, just the hollow gulp of the dark swallowing him whole. I didn’t wait for anything more. I lunged for the hatch, fingers scraping along the edge as I hauled myself up. I didn’t bother closing it. I just ran.

The porch lights were dead, the world a blur as I burst outside, nearly twisting my ankle on the slick boards. I skidded across the wet grass, scrambling upright, lungs burning. Then I threw myself into the car, jammed the key in, and kicked the engine awake.

I drove until the house vanished behind the trees, until the glow of Colby’s porch, dead and hollow, was nothing but a smudge in the rearview mirror. My hands were trembling so hard the wheel kept slipping under my fingers, the rubber feeling slick, like someone else’s grip was still on it.

A mile out, I finally let myself breathe. It came out shaky, uneven, like my lungs were trying to cough out the fear still lodged inside them. The road was empty, just a pale strip cutting through the fields, the headlights catching nothing but fog and the occasional fence post.

When I hit the first crossroads, I slowed down. Not because I wanted to, my whole body screamed at me to keep going, never look back but because I needed to know if something was behind me. I checked the mirrors once. Twice. A third time.

Nothing.

By the time I reached my street, the sky was starting to grey, just that dead, washed-out color the world gets before anything wakes up. The houses looked unfamiliar, like copies of homes I used to know. Even mine. Especially mine.

I parked crooked in the driveway, halfway onto the grass, too drained to care. The engine clicked as it cooled, each sound sharp enough to make me flinch. I sat there for a moment with my forehead against the steering wheel, just breathing, trying to remember what “safe” was supposed to feel like.

Eventually, I forced myself out. The air was damp, colder than I expected, and it slapped me awake enough to move. Gravel crunched under my shoes as I walked to the door, every step slow. My legs felt like they still remembered the basement, like they expected hands to grab them again any second.

The key almost slipped out of my fingers when I tried to unlock the door. I hadn’t realized how stained my hands were until I saw the dark, dried streaks under the porch light. His blood. Mine. I didn’t know. I didn’t want to know.

I shut the door behind me and leaned on it, eyes closed, letting the familiar smell of dust and old wood settle around me. For a second, it helped.

I kicked off my shoes, letting them fall wherever, and walked to the kitchen. The lights flickered on, too bright after the dark, and I had to squint. The room was untouched, same mugs by the sink, same half-empty cereal box, same note on the fridge I’d meant to throw away a week ago.

But even after I locked the door, deadbolt, chain, the whole works, my chest stayed tight, like something in me was still braced for Colby to come lurching out of the dark with that screwdriver jutting from his arm, eager to return the favor by burying it in my eyes.

I went straight to the sink and scrubbed my hands like a man trying to wash off a crime. The water ran brown, dirt, blood,rot of the basement , who knows, and the harder I scrubbed, the hotter my skin burned. I dumped the bowls and cups the moment they filled, terrified the stink of that place might cling to the ceramic, might somehow call him here like a dog following a scent trail.

That’s when the floorboard behind me creaked.

My heart didn’t just jump, it tried to claw its way out of my ribs. I spun around, fist cocked, ready to plant a punch right between those big, weepy cow eyes of his-

\-but it wasn’t Colby.

It was Samantha.

She squinted at me from the doorway, her face half-lit, half-lost in shadow, looking more confused than scared.

“What are you doing?” she asked, voice thick with sleep.

I had never been so relieved to see another human being in my life. Something inside me cracked open. I rushed to her and wrapped her up, clutching her like some kid who stayed up past bedtime watching a horror flick and then realized he still had to walk down the hallway alone.

She smiled, small, tired and looped her arms around me, though they hung weakly, like she barely had the strength to hold her own weight.

“It’s okay,” she whispered against my shoulder. “You should get some rest.”

I pulled back just to make sure she was real, that her eyes weren't a pair of glass Christmas decorations.

“I didn’t hear you come in,” she murmured, brushing her thumb over the side of my hand. “You’re shaking.”

“Yeah” I whispered “Rough night”

I just replied, feeling myself sinking deeper into her embrace with every passing second.

Thankfully, she didn’t push for details. If she had, I wasn’t sure what would’ve spilled out. 

She just squeezed my wrist and stepped past me, grabbing a towel off the counter to wipe the water I’d splashed everywhere. She moved slowly, like everything hurt. Or maybe she was just that tired.

“You’re gonna crash hard in a minute,” she said, voice soft, almost patient. “Just… go lie down. I’ll clean the rest.”

I nodded, swallowing the knot in my throat. The tension in my body was still buzzing like static, but I didn’t argue. I felt stripped raw, like a thin-skinned version of myself.

She guided me toward the doorway with a warm, steady hand on my back. I managed a nod, or something close to it, and drifted down the hall. I don’t remember getting to the bedroom. I don’t remember lying down. One heartbeat I was upright, the next I was gone, sinking into the mattress.

Sleep didn’t come gently. It came in crushing waves, thick darkness, then a flash of memory so sharp it felt like glass. Over and over, the same moment.

The screwdriver sinking into his hand.

My brain, ever the showman, decided to ramp up the production.

Now let’s see it in slow motion!

Some deranged director living behind my eyes shouted it like a carnival barker.

And suddenly it all stretched out, inch by awful inch, the push of metal against skin, the way it puckered before it tore, the sickening give of flesh parting around the steel. The color of it, the heat of it, the way his breath hitched wetly in shock. Every frame a little clearer than it had any right to be.

When the show finally sputtered to an end, I came to with the bed half-cold beside me. Samantha was already gone, of course, she was. At least one of us had some damn sense of manners, or mortals, as my scrambled brain tried to call it. She hadn’t had the heart to wake me. 

There was no refund for the night’s entertainment unless you counted the puddle of drool glued to my pillow. I peeled my cheek off it with a wet smack that felt far too loud in the empty room.

For a split second, I let myself pretend the whole thing had been a fever dream, one of those sweaty, delirious nightmares you laugh about later but never really forget. But reality settled in fast. My body told the truth before my mind could lie: muscles stiff like I’d run a marathon through broken glass, a skull-throb pounding behind my eyes like a truck tire had used my head for a speed bump.

Yesterday happened.

All of it.

I walked into the kitchen, made myself a cup of black coffee, and sipped it between bites of yesterday’s stale sandwich. Then another long, scalding shower, scrubbing myself until my skin felt new, or at least separate from the night before. Fresh clothes, keys in hand, and I got in the car.

Half of me wanted to go to work and pretend nothing had happened.

The other half wanted to walk into the nearest police station, even if I had nothing that would make sense to say.

I went with the first option.

So I spent the morning taking X-rays of dogs that swallowed things they shouldn’t, socks batteries, God knows what else, checking tabbies whose kidneys were finally waving the white flag, smiling and nodding whenever the job required it.

I was in the middle of a routine checkup on a green parrot named Polly, who kept lunging for my stethoscope like it owed her money, when my phone buzzed in my pocket, slow and lazy at first.

Then again.

And again.

A steady, insistent tremor, like it was tapping its foot and waiting for me to get a clue.

I finally excused myself and pulled it out.

The screen was a mess of missed calls from Samantha.

Dozens of them.

And beneath those, message after message stacking on top of each other, flooding the screen so fast the notifications blurred into a single smear of panic.

I didn’t even think, I called her back immediately. My mind sprinted ahead of the ringing, car crash, her parents, the house on fire, God forbid another damn cat. Every worst-case scenario piled on top of the next.

But when she picked up, she wasn’t crying.

She was breathless.

Happy.

Almost vibrating through the speaker.

“SOMEONE FOUND TOMMY!” she practically screamed, her voice cracking with joy.

And for a second, the world just stopped.

“What?” The word tore out of me, strangled, thin, like my own voice didn’t believe what it was saying. Like it already knew, the lie should’ve collapsed by now.

“He just, came in!” Samantha rushed on, breathless, almost tripping over her own excitement. “Some fat guy, middle-aged, kind of sweaty, asking if we’d lost a cat!”

My stomach bottomed out.

“And he had Tommy,” she said, and the joy in her voice felt like a knife sliding between my ribs. “He had him, babe. Said he found him wandering near the outskirts of town. He’s a little dirty but otherwise he’s fine! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?”

Her voice cracked on the last word.

I didn’t answer.

Because I could believe it.

And my hands had started to shake.

“Babe? Babe, are you there? Can I drop him off soon? I want you to check him out- y’know, make sure no cat messed with him.”

She’d said cat, not car, but it didn’t matter. My brain snagged on the wrongness of all of it, the impossible overlap of truth and nightmare. I still couldn’t believe any of it was happening. Couldn’t believe the lie hadn’t detonated in my face.

My hand dragged across my forehead, and only then did I notice how slick it was, sweat beading at my hairline like I’d just sprinted a mile.

“Yeah… yeah,” I muttered. My voice sounded far away, like it belonged to someone calmer than I was. “Drop him by… anytime. Whenever.”

I hung up before she could hear the panic creeping in through my teeth.

The phone slipped back into my pocket, disappearing into the dark like something I didn’t want to look at. The leftover notifications still buzzed against my leg, faint, persistent, like a ghost tapping from inside a coffin lid.

I turned back to Polly and her owner, forcing a smile that barely fit on my face.

“She’s fine,” I said, voice thin. “See you next month.”

But the thought kept chewing at me, buzzing in my skull like flies crowding a fresh corpse, ribs of truth jutting out from under the rotting lie I’d wrapped around everything.

Then I just folded.

Sat down on the cold tile floor beneath one of the cabinet shelves, knees drawn in, like I was ducking from gunfire, only I could hear.

I stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, time stretching thin and strange, until I heard footsteps coming down the hall.

Samantha.

I pushed myself up fast, pretending I’d just dropped something, like I’d been crouched down hunting for a pen that rolled away instead of hiding behind the cabinet like a nervous wreck. But the truth was sitting right there on the counter in front of me, a blue cat carrier. The thing I’d really lost stuffed neatly inside it like evidence.

She rounded the table, saw me, and practically launched herself at me. Her arms wrapped tight, too tight, squeezing the air out of my lungs. I felt like an almost-empty tube of toothpaste, one good press away from spilling whatever guts I have left in me.

“ISN'T IT EXCITING? Our little family is whole again!”

She beamed at me, that wide white grin of hers almost too bright, then pulled away just enough to press a kiss to my lips. I prayed it didn’t taste like rot. She gave the carrier a gentle tap before looking back up at me.

“So, when are you getting off?”

“In like an hour… half an hour.”

My eyes were glued to the carrier. No way in hell was I staying here for an hour. Not now.

“Great!”

Samantha grinned and leaned down to peek inside, giving whatever was in there a tiny, cheerful wave.

“See ya soon, buddy. Have fun with daddy, alright?”

Her voice went soft, sweet before she straightened again.

“Oh, and the guy slipped me his phone number, just in case.” She said it like she was offering me a coupon from the Sunday paper. “He told me he didn’t need this junk anymore, but if you could call him and maybe drop it off after you bring Tommy home? That’d be just great.”

“Phone number?”

The words fell out of my mouth like I’d never heard the term before, like telephone was some new plague spreading through town.

She snorted. “I didn’t know you were the jealous type!”

That smirk of hers cut across her face like a fresh knife mark. “Not in a creepy way, alright? Just… y’know.”

“How did he look?”

She screwed up her face, digging around in her brain like the memory was stuck behind cobwebs.

“Uhhh… fat guy. Real pale. And he reeked, God, he reeked…of like…” She rotated her hand, searching.

“Bleach?” I offered.

“Yeah. Yeah, like chemicals and cigarette smoke had a baby and then left it in a hot car.”

She glanced around the room again, like something in here might suddenly explain itself if she stared hard enough.

“But… how did you know, though?”

“He stopped by here a couple times,” I said. My tongue felt too big in my mouth. “With a cat.”

“OOOHH. Alright, got it!”

She laughed, bright and careless, like nothing in the world had ever gone wrong. “Yeah, see you in a bit! Love you!”

I watched her leave, watched the shape of her slip away from the doorframe and vanish down the hall like a ghost.

Now I was alone with it, sitting on my table like a package someone should have burned instead of delivered. I didn’t know if I was ready to see how he looked all “adjusted.” My hand drifted to the scalpel. Cold metal, thin as a whisper, steady in my grip. I squeezed it until the handle bit into my palm. After what I’d done with that screwdriver, I figured I could manage this, too.

I unlatched the crate. One piece of metal slid off another with a sound like a tired machine screaming in its sleep. The door swung open with a long, rusty whine, like something that had been left out in the rain too many nights.

I stepped back, wedging myself between two wooden shelves painted white. Funny thought, the blood splatter would look beautiful against that clean backdrop if this thing decided to go for my throat.

Instead, an orange shape eased out of the carrier.

And a sound followed.

A purr. A warm, rolling, family purr.

Not the metallic, broken rattle I’d heard before. Not forced, not wrong.

This one was soft, organic.

The scalpel slid out of my hand, clattering against the floor as my fingers uncurled in something like relief, weak, shaky, stupid relief.

Because it looked like Tommy.

The fat bastard who’d been reduced to a bloody street pancake was somehow back again. Standing there. Breathing. Purring. A perfect, uncanny copy dropped straight out of some cosmic printer. Sure, one of the hind legs dragged just a hair, and one eye drifted a little too far left, as if it couldn’t quite remember where the world was supposed to be but it was him.

It was fucking him, in all his high-cholesterol, hairball-hoarding glory.

I dug out my phone, thumb trembling just enough to piss me off. The second the screen lit up, I dialed Samantha.

“I’ll be late,” I said, already rehearsing the lie in my head. “I need to run some extra checkups on Tommy… an hour, maybe?”

It rolled off my tongue too easily. That was the part that scared me, how natural lying had become, like slipping into a pair of worn shoes.

And before I knew it, I was back in the car, engine coughing to life. The blue carrier sat on the passenger seat like evidence of a crime. I was driving out to return it to its rightful owner.

After all, he deserved to get something back too.

1pb8s68,https://www.reddit.com/r/LostButLovingIt/comments/1pb8s68/a_personal_journey_through_training_development/,A Personal Journey Through Training & Development,"I still remember the first day I stepped into a corporate training room—wide-eyed, underprepared, and carrying the kind of nervous excitement that comes from knowing you’re starting something new but not fully understanding what that “something” is. The room smelled faintly of whiteboard markers and coffee, and the trainer’s slides were already glowing on the screen, displaying the bold words: **""Training & Development: The Journey Begins.""**

At the time, I didn’t realize how much that phrase would eventually shape not only my career but also my identity.

# Early Lessons: Training Is More Than Instruction

My first real exposure to structured training came during my initial months at a logistics company. As part of onboarding, we were required to complete a mix of classroom sessions, digital modules, and hands-on shadowing. One of those sessions introduced us to the HR management portal we would use for everything—attendance, leaves, performance reviews. It was the first time I came across [hrms delhivery. com](https://www.searchenginemagazine.com/hrms-delhivery-com), not knowing then that it would soon become a small but steady anchor in my learning journey.

What I loved most about those early days was how training wasn’t presented as a one-time event. Our mentors made it clear: learning is continuous, and development is personal. “Your growth doesn’t end when training ends,” one of them said, and I wrote the line down in my notebook. I’ve carried that sentence with me for years.

# The Turning Point: When Training Meets Real Life

The first time I truly understood the power of Training & Development was when I transitioned into a team lead role. Suddenly, I wasn’t just learning—I was expected to teach.

And teaching, I quickly discovered, forces you to learn even faster.

My team had a mix of fresh graduates and employees who’d been around longer than I had. I had to conduct weekly knowledge-sharing sessions on process improvements, system updates, and customer communication standards. At first, I simply relayed information, the way I had been taught. But slowly, I realized that training is not about transferring knowledge; it’s about **transforming people**.

One team member, in particular, stands out. He was shy, soft-spoken, and struggled with confidence during client calls. I started spending extra time with him—running mock sessions, giving small tasks, and celebrating tiny improvements. Over months, I watched him transform into someone who could lead conversations, handle escalations, and eventually train new joiners himself.

That’s when it struck me: **development is cyclical**. Someone invests in you, and someday, you get to invest in someone else. It’s an ever-expanding circle of growth.

# The Skill-Shift Era: Learning to Learn Again

A few years into my career, the corporate world began shifting faster than ever—automation, AI-driven operations, digital workflows. Suddenly, the skills that once felt comfortable started feeling outdated. It wasn’t enough to know “how things were done.” We had to understand how things were *changing*.

I enrolled in every training opportunity I could find—leadership workshops, data interpretation primers, conflict-resolution bootcamps, even a self-paced course on emotional intelligence. Some sessions were amazing. Some were boring. All of them taught me something.

Around this time, I learned the value of **self-driven development**. The best employees weren’t the ones waiting for the company to train them—they were the ones who sought learning proactively.

I also discovered my own preferred learning style. While some people thrived in group discussions, I found that I understood concepts best when I could apply them immediately. I became the kind of learner who would walk out of a training session and immediately think, “Where can I use this today?”

This shift in mindset didn’t just make me better at my job; it made me better at understanding myself.

# Training as Transformation: A Personal Realization

As I moved into more senior responsibilities, I began designing training programs rather than simply attending them. And I realized something powerful—**a good training program doesn’t just teach tasks; it shapes mindsets**.

I would structure sessions that didn’t just cover “what to do” but also “why we do it.” I encouraged questions, cultivated curiosity, and made space for people to bring their experiences into the room. Training became a collaborative experience rather than a lecture.

One of the most fulfilling moments in my career came when a team member told me, “Your training didn’t just help me perform better. It helped me believe I could grow.”

It reminded me of myself years ago—nervous, unsure, looking at that glowing screen on my first day.

# Looking Back—and Forward

When I reflect on my journey, I see a clear pattern: every milestone in my career came after a learning moment. Every challenge was softened by preparation, and every leap forward was supported by development—either from a mentor, a training program, or a lesson learned the hard way.

Training & Development has never been just a function of HR for me. It has been a companion, a guide, a mirror, and sometimes even a push when I needed one.

And as the corporate world continues to evolve, one truth remains constant:

**Partnership #2:** Found someone on LinkedIn. Great skills, but wanted 50% equity while keeping his full-time job and only working weekends. We had different definitions of ""commitment.""
    
    
**Partnership #3:** Connected through a mutual friend. Amazing developer, but we discovered 2 months in that he wanted to build a lifestyle business while I was going for venture scale.

    - Fill out a compatibility quiz about work style, commitment level, and vision
    - Set your preferences (location, skills needed, project stage)
    - Swipe through founder profiles - right if interested, left to pass
    - When both founders swipe right, it's a match
    - Chat directly on the platform to see if there's real chemistry
    
    
**What makes it different:**
    - No more awkward coffee meetings with mismatched expectations

So, I figured, let’s cut the crap and share some things I've learned (sometimes the hard way!) to help us all level up without emptying our wallets. This is my ""Stop throwing money away!"" beginner creator growth guide – 2024 edition!

Think of this as me buying you a coffee and giving you the real talk. ☕️

Here's the deal:

*   **Content is king, but consistency is Queen (and she runs the show).** Seriously, a handful of banger posts won't do it. Think regularly, think valuable, think *you*. What unique flavor do *you* bring?

*   **Engagement isn't just likes – it's building a freaking community!** Are you actually *talking* to your followers? Responding to comments? Starting discussions? Be a human, not a robot. People can smell a fake a mile away.

*   **SEO is your friend, not your enemy.** Do you know *how* people are even finding your content? A little keyword research goes a LONG way. It’s like leaving breadcrumbs for your audience.

*   **Free tools are your secret weapon.** You don't need a fancy, expensive editing suite when there's a ton of awesome free (or freemium) options out there.

*   **Speaking of tools...AI can be your best friend.** Are you still spending hours staring at a blank page? Check out something like Easy Peasy AI, for example (full disclosure, I'm an affiliate, so I get a little something if you sign up through [https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca](https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca)).

Making real friends here feels tougher than it should. People are nice, they’ll talk, meet for coffee, go out… but it rarely turns into a genuine friendship. Everyone feels busy, distant or just tired in general. It’s like nobody has the energy to build deeper bonds anymore.

At the same time, I keep coming across so many stories about office romance, situationships, cheating, people quietly separating, and marriages falling apart. I’m not judging anyone, but the number of such stories feels unusually high.

I’m honestly confused.
Is this just normal for a big city, or has Delhi actually changed?
Is everyone feeling this kind of emotional instability, or am I just noticing it more now?

Would love to hear if others relate to this.

Today I woke up and thought about how my mothering is very similar to how I was mothered, and also different. 

Like my own mother, I am a sleepy woman. I need a good deal of sleep and rest. In general, I'm really happy curling up quietly with a book on the couch all weekend. I can also be a bit materialistic in a sense-- I also love buying things, spending the day at the shops looking in the windows, and having a nice lunch out.  I am not a joiner and don't do a ton of structured activities with my toddler, more vibes really. I used to criticize my mom for this, but now I really get it. Life is tiring. Mothering is tiring. 

I woke up thinking about this because I was too tired to get up today (like I am many mornings), having done some toddler wakings. My husband got our 2 year old out of bed and did the morning routine and brought me coffee in bed. I stumbled down the stairs to kiss her goodbye. My mother also always got coffee in bed, and often didn't say goodbye to me in the mornings as she was sleeping in. 

What will make a difference in my mothering? I have a degree of personal and financial independence my SAHM mother never knew.  I work, and am a scientist living off of the fruit of my brain. I model that for my daughter. When I window shop, I do it at thrift stores. We consume modestly. My own family went bankrupt due to my parent's poor spending and this impacted me a lot growing up.   


But by and large, one of the biggest differences is the man I married. My own father was physically and emotionally abusive, undependable, and profoundly angry. I married a gentle, soft, terribly sweet man who suffers from sadness but rarely anger. 

  
Sometimes I look in the mirror and see my mother, and look at my daughter and see myself, replaying the same scenes, but with a different soundtrack, and a different feeling all together. The same sleepy mom, but not one who seems like she is running away from life the way mine did. I hope.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Brondby vs. Fredericia: A Danish Superliga Showdown Where the Underdog’s Hope is Thinner Than Fredericia’s Defense**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a match that’s as lopsided as a pancake on a rollercoaster! On December 1, 2025, Brondby IF, the Danish Superliga’s third-place juggernaut, hosts FC Fredericia, a team whose defensive record could make a sieve blush. Let’s break this down with the precision of a GPS and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Brondby is the Favorite, and Fredericia is… Well, Not

Brondby’s odds of **1.25 to 1.29** (implied probability: **80%**) scream “bank on this,” while Fredericia’s **8.5 to 10.5** (9–10%) are the soccer equivalent of a snowball’s chance in a sauna. Even the draw at **5.5 to 6.0** (16.7–18.5%) feels like a Hail Mary from Fredericia’s perspective. Statistically, this is a mismatch that makes a WWE championship match look balanced.

Brondby’s stats are as sturdy as a Viking longship: **10 wins, 1 draw, 5 losses** in 16 games, with a **29-goal offensive arsenal** and a **16-goal defense** that’s tighter than a jar of pickles. At home, they’re a scoring machine (**2.2 goals/game**) and a fortress (**1.4 conceded**). Star man Noah Nartey, with **4 goals and 3 assists**, is the team’s culinary chef—always adding the secret ingredient.

Fredericia, meanwhile, is a cautionary tale. **3 wins, 2 draws, 11 losses**? That’s a win percentage lower than a toddler’s attention span. They’ve scored **18 goals** (0.7/game) and conceded **40** (3.0/game)—a defensive record that makes a sieve look like a brick wall. Their away form? A six-game losing streak, including a **5-0 drubbing** by FC Nordsjælland. If Fredericia’s defense were a person, it’d be the guy who trips over his own shoelaces *and* forgets to lock the door.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and the Art of Self-Sabotage

Recent news isn’t kind to Fredericia. Their away form is a tragicomedy of errors: **6 losses on the road**, with **0.7 goals scored** and **3.0 conceded**. Their last match? A **5-0 humiliation** against Nordsjælland that probably inspired a team meeting titled “How to Not Score Goals.” No major injuries are reported, but when your offense is this anemic, even a healthy squ

1. Budget: We have around 5-600 USD) for 2 people, excluding flights. Is this enough for a comfortable trip if we want a decent hotel (not a hostel) and good food?
2. Transport & Stay: I haven't booked a hotel yet, confused about Airbnb aswell with some negative review about noise. Which area is most convenient? Do you guys have any recommendation? Also, should we rent a motorbike, or is the traffic too chaotic for visitors? I am leaning towards staying central, walking, and using Grab/taxi for further distances.

Bengaluru is the only city I know that can hand you three seasons before lunch, a philosophical auto driver by 4 PM, and a mysteriously damp patch of road that absolutely shouldn’t be damp.

• I take long walks just to watch the city change moods like a temperamental UI
• I treat my morning filter coffee like a sacred loading screen
• I believe dosa ordering is a personality test
• And once tried journaling in Lalbagh but ended up befriending a dog who understood boundaries better than most humans

I’m not here hunting romance, drama, or a checklist of “connections.”

I currently have a coffee setup that I'm looking to move from my kitchen to my dining room. The kitchen had sufficient outlets for each device. I'm a bit stumped now. I have three devices, but only two plugs (1 gang if that's correct?) and one of the cables is a tad short. 

1. My coffee machine per the website says its 1600 watts (110V)

2. My coffee grinder is 300 watts (100-120V)

3. The kettle is 1000-1200 watts (110-120V) this one has the short power cord 

For reference if it matters, I live in California and I assume the outlet in the dining room is 15A rated.

I will never use the coffee machine at the same time as the kettle, but I would use the coffee grinder along with the coffee machine or the kettle. The coffee grinder is used at most 20 seconds at a time.

Is it possible to have all 3 on the two plugs and use a strip and an additional extension cord for the short kettle cord?

I imagine in this scenario it would be:

1. coffee machine on one plug

2. on the other plug - power strip with grinder and the extension cord + kettle

Is this feasible if I get a properly rated extension cord and power strip? 

Is this something I should even be worrying about? Thanks for the help!",1,1764579940.0,AskElectricians,1,1.0,False

I grew up in the area but moved away mid-HS, and hadn’t been back to the area until last year. We loved it. Now before anyone says anything about the winter, we know…..Plus, we currently live in NYC; the winters here are similarly grey and miserable, but with way more concrete and naked trees everywhere. 

We are moving for proximity to nature and family, as most of the immediate family on my side have moved back. We will be visiting again in a few weeks, so plan to spend time in our top neighborhoods.

I am leaning towards Green Lake/Phinney Ridge/Greenwood, but have also looked at Queen Anne, West Seattle, Shoreline, and would generally consider any neighborhood or suburb that fits our needs, except for Bellevue.


Budget: $3-3.5k, with a little wiggle room (combined income around $200k)

Looking for: townhome or house, 3bd/1.5+ba or 2bd with flex space 

Non-negotiables: W/D, dishwasher, lots of windows. 

Area priorities: lots of trees, walkability, coffee, groceries, parks

Don’t care about: bar scene, trendiness


Want to avoid: flooding-prone areas near waterfronts (ETA: or ice-prone!)


I would love not to have to buy a second car right away (we have a hybrid) so would be thrilled to be near transit and grocery stores, especially Trader Joe’s and/or PCC.

A baby is a nearish possibility so the third bedroom and walkability are very much with that in mind! My mother is in Kirkland and would provide childcare (plus I work remote.) I’m wondering what the commute would be like to Kirkland, especially before 7 am. I’ve heard horrible things (but coming from NYC…we will live.)

I know variations of this are asked ad nauseam, so I greatly appreciate any input or tips on where to look, what else to consider, and if I seem to be on the right track, especially if a little one joins the mix.

Coffee. Keys. Wallet. Stress.  
I had to deliver something across the city for my small business — nothing big, just routine stuff I’ve done a thousand times.

But halfway through the drive, my GPS rerouted me (as usual) through some random residential area. I was already annoyed because I hate unexpected turns, and my brain was like:  
“Great. There goes my schedule.”

Then I saw this older man on the sidewalk struggling with a giant stack of boxes. Like bro… these boxes were taller than him. He looked like one wrong move and gravity would win instantly.

I don’t know why, but I stopped the car without thinking.  
Put on my hazards.  
Walked up.  
“Sir, you okay? Need a hand?”

He looked up at me — surprised, then relieved — and said,  
*“I used to carry things like this for others. Feels strange needing help now.”*

Idk what it was about that sentence, but it hit me.  
Because wow… isn’t that all of us at some point?

We spend years being strong for everyone, family, friends, work, and one random Tuesday we’re suddenly the one who needs a little help… even if we hate admitting it.

Anyway, I helped him bring the boxes to his porch. He kept saying “thank you,” but honestly I felt like I walked away with more than he did.

It just made me realize something small but kinda huge:

Most people aren’t cold.  
Most people aren’t rude.  
Most people are just… tired.  
And sometimes one tiny act, even a 30-second favor, can restore someone’s faith in people more than we’ll ever know.

I got back in my car, continued my delivery, and weirdly… the day didn’t feel annoying anymore.  
Felt lighter.

I’m a local Beijinger in my 30s, working on a small personal project about how foreign tourists really experience Beijing.

When I look online (YouTube, TikTok, Chinese social media), I mostly see the same pattern:
- Foreign tourists go to Tiananmen, Forbidden City, Great Wall, Temple of Heaven
- Chinese English-speaking guides explain history, emperors, palaces, Peking duck, zhajiangmian
- Then the trip ends

That’s all great and important, but as someone who lives here, I keep wondering:

1️⃣ If you’re visiting Beijing for the first time…

Be honest:

- Are places like Forbidden City / Great Wall the main thing you’re excited about?

- Or are they more like: “Okay, I’ll go because I should… but I’m also curious about real life in the city”?

If you’ve already been to Beijing (or China), what did you actually enjoy the most?

Classic landmarks?

Or random things like: local supermarkets, metro chaos, weird snacks, parks, night walks, etc.?

2️⃣ Would you be interested in seeing the “other side” of Beijing?

By “other side” I mean things that don’t usually appear in tour packages:

- Where young people actually hang out (modern malls, creative districts, riverside walks)

- Gyms / boxing / yoga / sports parks

- Cafés / co-working style places where people study, work, date

- Bars / livehouses / club areas (from quiet jazz bars to loud party streets)

- Trendy / niche restaurants instead of only “Peking duck #3 on TripAdvisor”

If you had 1–2 days after doing the classic sights, what kind of “real life in Beijing” experience would you want?

Examples:

“I’d love to try a nice gym & see how people work out in China”

“I want to see where 20–30 year olds actually shop and hang out on a Friday night”

“I’d like a quiet bar with good cocktails and not too smoky / crazy”

“I just want to sit in a café and people-watch with good Wi-Fi and coffee”


I’m not selling a tour right now, I’m mainly trying to understand what foreign visitors actually want, and building a long-term project (videos + a playbook) to help people survive their first 24–48 hours here.


3⃣ If you’re planning to come to Beijing (or have already been)

I’d love to hear:

1. Have you been to Beijing before?

What did you do? What felt overrated? What surprised you?

2. If you’re planning to come:

After the Great Wall / Forbidden City, what would your perfect “real life” day in Beijing look like?

3. Would you be interested in:
A local who focuses less on “emperor stories” and more on “how people actually live, move, pay, and have fun in 2025 Beijing”?

If you don’t want to comment publicly but are happy to share your thoughts / experience, you can also email me here: [dandsunshine1994@gmail.com]
I’ll read everything and use it to design better “Beijing survival + real life” routes for future visitors.

Initially before the due date, we told family and friends that we don't want to see anyone for about two weeks and no unannounced visits. Everyone respected that. A few weeks before the due date my dad (who moved to another country with his new wife after the divorce) called and said he heard about the two weeks rule. He didn't have to ask, I was just so happy that he makes the journey over, that I said he could come into the hospital if my wife felt well enough. 
He was the only one who we allowed come to the hospital. I took a picture of him holding his granddaughter, and the proud father I was sent it to Mom. She was pissed off and sad (crocodile tears) that he could come and nobody else. She later complained to my sister and said to her that ""he doesn't see the need to come over and see you more often anyways"". My sister told me that in a message after I went to visit my maternal grandmother where my mom also was. During that visit, my grandma insisted on mom getting a picture with my baby.
Overall, in my opinion, my mom has an entitled and expecting behavior when it comes to my daughter and it feels like she is trying to force her help onto us instead of offering and waiting for a response like the rest of the family. We didn't tell her that we went to visit my paternal grandparents multiple times before and since, because a, we feel comfortable there and the baby does too and b, they don't make a visit feel forced.

It all came to blows last Wednesday. While I was at work my mom texted that she had some diapers and baby clothes that she wanted to send over, or she could come by and drop it off. I replied that I was going to talk about it to my wife when I get home and I would talk to her later. She answered that it seems like we don't want her to come, but that she's going to wait for a definitive answer...
She didn't wait. 
While I was still at work, my wife texted and said that my mom left. She came by to bring the stuff over and ""talk to my wife alone and offer her help in person"", also she seemingly was afraid that I was already there since a neighbors car looked similar to mine. Before she left, my mom offered to sweep through our apartment, but at that point my wife wanted her to leave and declined. Moms response: ""seems like you have a hard time accepting help"".
I was furious at that and told my mom as much when she texted later, apologizing. I also said that there are things I'd like to say but won't, because I know she will get mad at it.
She insisted I tell her the things in a crocodile tear filled message, because only then can she improve.
So I told her how I feel about everything. Her reaction to the dad thing, her expecting behavior and such. And I directly told her that only two people can decide who comes by and gets to see our daughter, that's my wife and me. Nobody else.
In the three minute long voice message I remained calm but direct. After listening to thirty seconds of it, mom said she wouldn't listen to it if I talk to her like she was ""some stupid brat"" eventually she listened to the entirety.

The reaction was exactly what I expected.
How dare I accuse her of something like that...
She wasn't upset about dad coming, just that we didn't tell anyone we were having visitors...
How dare we treat people like that...
How dare we treat Grandma like that... (We initially cancelled coming to her 88th birthday because we think it could be too stressful for the baby to be at a large party and family gathering. However, we later agreed to come by for coffee because Grandma appealed that it might be her last)
She knows she can't expect anything about our daughter and everything we send is a gift...
I don't have to educate her on who gets to see my baby...
From now on she won't send us anything before asking if it's okay, or offer anything without us asking (exactly what me and my wife wanted from the start and the rest of the family already does)

We haven't spoken since, but my wife and I agreed that we are definitely not coming to her house for Christmas. 

Edit: I know I kind of started the whole drama with the nuclear mistake of sending that photo. However, since my childhood, my mom has been incredibly narcissistic and controlling, which did contribute to my parents divorce, and why after going to therapy and breaking free of her manipulation, I developed a much better relationship to my dad. He was there and helped however he could, even when living in another country. While with her, I basically had to fend for myself since I was 15, just living in the house and being given a budget to look after myself.",8,1764578922.0,offmychest,12,0.62,False

1pb7s4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1pb7s4h/bf_lied_about_sex_with_ex_before_we_were_exclusive/,Bf lied about sex with ex before we were exclusive,"Hi friends, looking for advice. I (35F) have been dating someone (35M) for 3 months. Aside from one big glaring ex issue, our relationship feels like it was meant to be, truly. As a mid thirties woman, I know what I’m looking for. Naturally on the first date I’d asked him about previous relationships, to which he said he’d been with someone for 12 years, but knew he couldn’t marry her. They’d met young, went through college and grad school together. They’d only lived together for 2 of the 12 years, and broke it off amicably after couples therapy. He said he hadn’t talked to her since, had dated 2 others since then, and hadn’t dated anyone in 6 months prior to meeting me.

What he failed to mention, and actually denied until finally confessing 2 weeks ago, was that at some point she’d unblocked him, reached out for “closure” 2 months before we met, and that he had slept with her 3 times since, only once after he and I started dating, but before we were exclusive, which is an important detail. He said it was just sex, not good sex and not emotional, just someone he preferred over a stranger. She was there and willing basically, FWB without the friend part maybe. Gross I know, but shit happens.

He has been consistent and honest with me about everything except that. He swears he has no feelings for her. That he doesn’t speak to her, that he’s committed to me, that he would never and has never cheated. He loves me. He told her he is in a relationship now and cut her off. He said he lied about it because we weren’t exclusive, he felt shame, embarrassment, and didn’t want it to affect our relationship which he wanted to pursue. But then I found out he’d gotten a happy birthday text from her recently, she’d asked him to meet for coffee, she works with his brother, has relationships with his sisters, etc. aka she’s still hanging on/attached, and it doesn’t help that he slept with her. I actually feel sorry for her tbh. Basically he’d lied/has been lying about their connection which actually overlapped him and me, and is just now starting to reveal details.

The worst part about his communication around this topic is that the truth is coming out in pieces. I’ll learn something new, feel horrible, move past it, then another detail comes to light days later. We’re both getting frustrated. I’ve told him I’d wished he was just honest from the beginning… that lying made me have a false sense of safety, which is now broken. It makes me feel anxious - what else is he hiding? Why not enter a relationship with transparency?

All that said - I can’t help but get stuck on the lies. I find myself anxious at night, trying to solve for “x” - but what difference does it make, to know the details before we were exclusive, is it helpful? It feels like the foundation of our relationship and trust is based off lies, and I’m playing detective, but I don’t want to be. I find something out and it only pushes us further apart, but when I look at who he is after exclusivity he is exactly what I’ve been looking for in a partner and he feels the same about me. His actions show he’s committed. His words tell a different story, but as I’ve said I actually understand the “why” behind the lie... we were not exclusive. But questions remain: why is it so hard for him to admit he may have been confused about her, that he might have had unresolved feelings that needed to be explored. I would have understood. He chose me, and chooses me, aka if he wanted to be with her he could.

How do I get past this? Because without her, we have something real, something good. And honestly I do not want to break up over someone’s pre-exclusive decisions. We all have baggage at this age, everyone has an ex they lost under confusing circumstances. He had loose boundaries with her that he explored, and even regrets, but perhaps he found closure in doing so. So why am I so stuck on the details? Please Reddit, help me get past this with a new perspective so we can focus on rebuilding the love and trust. I’m tired of ex drama.

Btw. I know I’m an upgrade for him. I don’t need this relationship, and I’m not acting out of desperation. But at some point in life you have to choose love, so long as both parties agree to work towards that. And that’s what we’re trying to do.

TLDR: Bf slept with 12 year ex after meeting me and lied about it, but denies any emotional attachment. We both want to make it work.",0,1764578753.0,AskWomenOver30,14,0.5,False
1pb7rxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pb7rxb/aitah_for_blocking_a_toxic_friend_after_she/,AITAH for blocking a toxic friend after she admitted she tried to steal her friend's husband?,"I used to live in a fancy building in DC where the majority of residents were high income earner. A few were trust fund babies. I met an older women in the hallway of my floor and we became friends: going on walks, getting coffee, getting together for tea in the lounge, having girl's weekend trips. She didnt work and lived off her wealthy dad. She was in her 50s but could pass for 30s since she did all this high maintenance pampering.

Anyway, I noticed that she was obsessed with a guy she said she broke up with and hadn't dated in years. On our walks she would continually talk about him and his new girlfriend. I told her to just let him go and move on. I think she was stalking his Facebook and the guy encouraged it because they hooked up recently.

I ended the friendship after we had a girl's weekend and she started yelling and crying about how unfair her life is. Her sister's husband wouldn't let her visit their home and she was trying to claim that she helped her sister raise the kids. Her sister's family lived in another state, where she's from.

I was very upset about her yelling and crying like a baby, and I had my own problems that she never cared to ask about. 

I blocked her and moved from the building. She saw me moving and I just waived after she said hello. She was with some old lady and I could hear her talking about me. I just was glad to move out of DC.

 After a couple of years I just wanted to check up on her because I wanted so see if she was ok and I felt bad for how I ended things.

She came out to DC out of the blue without telling me and I went out of my way to rearrange my schedule so we can meet up. She kept changing her mind and didn't tell me what was going on. She finally admitted that she was at the home of another friend while the friend was out of town, yet she came there to sleep with the woman's husband. I told her that's really low class and just disgusting.

I sent her a long text of how disappointed I was after I hung up and how she doesn't respect her friends. I blocked her again and she called from different numbers and left numerous messages apologizing, but I didn't answer.

  
My husband doesn't know that she had an affair with her friend's husband (I don't like to gossip). He thinks I'm being mean. Aitah?

1pb7nvz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pb7nvz,A Saturday in Cabramatta,"We’ve visited well-known spots and thoroughly enjoyed them. I’m sharing my experiences and costs so others can plan their own visits.

First up was **Vinh Phat Chinese Seafood Restaurant**, a renowned yum cha spot. We arrived around 10:30 am and the queue was surprisingly short, so we were seated within two minutes. It was still half full but around 11 am they started taking people to the other side. We ordered six different dishes, though I’m not familiar with their names. They were all delicious and fresh! My favourite was the mango pancakes, which I’ve included a photo of. The total cost was $55.

Next, we visited **Cafe Nho,** another popular spot. We tried their Vietnamese iced coffee, which was strong but sweet. Coffee lovers should definitely give it a try. One iced coffee costs $6.50.

Our third stop was **The Phung N**, where we enjoyed sugar cane juice. I’d never tried it before, so I can’t compare it, but I liked this one. The citrus balanced the sweetness well. Some people complained about the ice level on google reviews, but it was fine for me. A regular type large size costs $4.50.

We were already full after this, so unfortunately we couldn’t try any more places. However, Tan Viet Noodle House and 3Q Quay Quan Quan are on our list for the next visit.",60,1764578287.0,foodies_sydney,7,0.96,False

1pb7l83,https://www.reddit.com/r/KailashMansoraverTour/comments/1pb7l83/food_and_accommodation_on_the_kailash_mansarovar/,Food and Accommodation on the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra,"The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra is a journey of austerity and devotion. While the hotels in the starting towns are modernizing, the high-altitude leg of the journey — the Kora — features **living conditions at high altitude** that are extremely basic. Understanding the difference between accommodations in the cities and on the sacred trail is essential for mental preparation and a successful pilgrimage. The focus shifts entirely from comfort to endurance.

# 1. The Gateway: Food and Lodging in Kathmandu and Tibetan Towns

The beginning stages of the Yatra, particularly in Nepal and the main transit towns of Tibet, offer significantly higher standards of **Kailash Mansarovar food and accommodation** than the trek itself. These stops are designed to facilitate essential rest and acclimatization.

# A. Nepal (Kathmandu, Nepalgunj)

* **Accommodation:** Typically 3-star to 4-star hotels. Pilgrims can expect comfortable, heated rooms, private attached bathrooms with hot water showers, reliable electricity, and Wi-Fi access.
* **Food:** Full-service dining. Meals are generally served buffet-style, offering a wide variety of freshly prepared, high-quality vegetarian food, specializing in Indian and Nepali cuisine (dal, rice, curries, bread, desserts).

# B. Tibetan Transit Towns (Kyirong, Saga, Darchen)

As you cross into Tibet and proceed to the high plateau, facilities become simpler, but remain adequate for rest.

* **Accommodation:** Standard hotels and modern guesthouses.
* **Amenities:** Rooms are usually shared (twin or triple basis). Most modern hotels in Saga and Darchen now offer attached Western-style bathrooms and hot water (often relying on solar or gas heaters), central heating, or electric blankets.
* **Darchen (4,670m):** As the Kora base camp, Darchen is the last reliable comfort stop. While some basic guesthouses exist, better hotels here provide oxygen supply systems and other high-altitude amenities.
* **Food:** Catering is handled by your tour team or local restaurants. **Meals during Kailash Yatra** here are typically hot, freshly cooked, and vegetarian, focused on high-carbohydrate content (rice, roti, dal, simple vegetable curries) to fuel the body for altitude and travel.

# 2. The Heart of the Pilgrimage: Accommodation on the Kora (Parikrama)

The three-day, 52-kilometer **Kailash Parikrama** is where pilgrims encounter true simplicity and austerity. The facilities here are minimal, forcing a reliance on communal support and spiritual focus. This represents the true **Kora difficulty** in terms of **living conditions at high altitude**.

# Dirapuk (Day 1 Camp) — 4,920m

* **Significance:** Offers the closest and most spectacular view of Mount Kailash’s North Face.
* **Accommodation:** **Basic, unheated, monastery-style guesthouses or mud houses.**
* **Sleeping:** Accommodation is strictly dormitory-style, often with 4–8 beds sharing a single, large, dark room. Privacy is minimal.
* **Heating:** Primary warmth comes from thick provided blankets and, crucially, **electric blankets/mats** supplied by the tour operator. Central heating is non-existent.
* **Sanitation:** There are **no attached bathrooms** or shower facilities. Pilgrims use common, shared, pit-style outdoor toilets (mud toilets). Many authorized agencies, including Namaste Nepal Trekking, provide separate, enclosed **Western-style toilet tents** for enhanced hygiene.

# Zutulpuk (Day 2 Camp) — 4,700m

* **Significance:** Famous for the meditation cave of the Buddhist saint Milarepa.
* **Accommodation:** Conditions are identical to — or sometimes even more rudimentary than — Dirapuk. It is generally a dormitory stay in basic stone or mud structures.
* **Facilities:** Shared, basic outdoor sanitation (pit toilets) is the norm. Hot water for washing is limited, typically provided only by your Sherpa/kitchen crew in a flask or bowl for a quick wash.

# Key Takeaway for the Kora

Pilgrims must be mentally prepared to forego modern comforts for these two nights. **Showers are unavailable.** The focus shifts to keeping warm, staying hydrated, and conserving energy for the strenuous trek ahead.

# 3. The Fuel for the Spirit: Meals During Kailash Yatra

Nutrition on the Yatra is a primary safety concern. Food must be high in carbohydrates, easily digestible, warm, and strictly vegetarian for the majority of pilgrims.

# The Food Philosophy: Warm, Simple, and High-Carb

Due to the remote environment and the high risk of altitude sickness affecting digestion, the food philosophy during the trek phase is centered around simple, warming, and digestible meals.

# Breakfast

The breakfast served during the Yatra is strategically designed to provide complex carbohydrates for sustained energy throughout the morning trek and drive. Typical offerings include warm, easily digestible options such as porridge (oatmeal), Poha (flattened rice), Puri/Paratha paired with Sabzi, toast with butter/jam, and plenty of hot beverages like tea, coffee, and Horlicks. This combination ensures the pilgrim has a solid, slow-releasing energy base to begin the day’s demanding schedule.

# Lunch

Lunch is crafted to be high-carb and easily digestible, primarily to prevent stomach distress and altitude-related nausea. Depending on the itinerary, this might be a packed lunch (especially crucial on Kora Day 2) or a hot meal served at a transit camp. Offerings are kept simple and restorative, featuring staples like plain rice and dal, Khichdi, noodle soup (Thukpa), simple vegetable curry, roti, or a basic salad. The simplicity of these meals ensures the body can focus on digestion and energy absorption without added strain.

# Dinner

Dinner focuses on warm, liquid-heavy dishes to aid critical overnight hydration and help replace the electrolytes lost during the day’s physical exertion. The meal typically begins with hot soup (essential for both warmth and hydration), followed by plain rice, rotis, high-protein dal (lentil soup), and a vegetable curry featuring mixed seasonal vegetables. A simple dessert, such as halwa or gulab jamun, is often included. The high-liquid and moderate-protein content supports recovery and prepares the body for the next day’s altitude challenges.

# Hydration: The Underrated Essential

The dry Tibetan air and increased breathing rate cause rapid dehydration, a major contributor to AMS.

* **Requirement:** Pilgrims must aim to drink **3–4 liters of fluid per day**.
* **Preference:** Warm drinks are vital for maintaining core body temperature. Our support team ensures a steady supply of hot water for filling thermos flasks, herbal teas, and soups.
* **Avoid:** Cold drinks, alcohol, and excessive caffeine, as these can contribute to dehydration.

# Personal Snacks

While meals are provided, carrying personal snacks is a powerful energy insurance policy, especially on Kora Day 2.

* **Recommended:** Energy bars, dried fruits (raisins, apricots), nuts (almonds, walnuts), glucose biscuits, and dark chocolate.

# 4. Sanitation and Hygiene in the Wilderness

Sanitation is one of the biggest challenges of the Yatra and demands an adaptable mindset.

* **Toilets:** As mentioned, use the outdoor pit toilets or the Western-style toilet tents provided by our team at the major stops (Manasarovar, Dirapuk, Zutulpuk).
* **Water:** Hot water is limited. Wiping down with warm water and a quick-dry towel or using **wet wipes/hand sanitizer** is the standard for maintaining daily hygiene. A full shower is not feasible until the return to a major town like Saga or Kyirong.
* **Waste:** This is an ecologically sensitive area. Pilgrims must use designated waste bags and avoid leaving any trash, particularly human waste and toilet paper, on the trail.

The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra tests the pilgrim’s resolve by minimizing physical comforts, allowing the spiritual goal to dominate the experience. By understanding and preparing for the basic nature of **guesthouses in Tibet** and the simple **meals during Kailash Yatra**, you ensure that logistics do not impede your spiritual journey.

1pb7kf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1pb7kf6/what_smart_plug_works_best_with_voice_assistants/,What smart plug works best with voice assistants?,"Finding the right smart plug that works smoothly with voice assistants can make your daily routine way easier. Instead of walking across the room to turn things on and off, you can just tell Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri to do it for you.

**What Makes a Smart Plug Compatible?**

Not all smart plugs play nice with every voice assistant. The best ones work with multiple platforms right out of the box. You want a device that connects quickly and responds without making you repeat commands three times.

Most quality smart plugs connect through WiFi and don't need extra hubs or bridges. This means fewer gadgets cluttering your space and simpler setup. You plug it in, download an app, connect it to your WiFi, and link it to your voice assistant. Done.

**Key Features to Look For**

When shopping for smart plugs that work with voice assistants, keep these things in mind:

- Multi-platform support (works with Alexa, Google Home, and HomeKit)
- Strong WiFi connection that doesn't drop randomly
- Compact design that doesn't block other outlets
- Energy monitoring to track power usage
- Scheduling options through the app
- Decent amp rating for larger appliances

**Popular Voice Assistant Compatibility**

Amazon Alexa smart plugs are super common because so many people own Echo devices. You can say ""Alexa, turn on the coffee maker"" and boom - your morning brew starts while you're still in bed.

Google Assistant compatible plugs work similarly with Google Home speakers and displays. The voice recognition tends to be really accurate, even with background noise.

Apple HomeKit smart plugs are pickier about which devices they support, but they offer solid security and work great if you're already in the Apple ecosystem.

**Real-World Uses**

Smart plugs shine when you connect them to regular ""dumb"" devices. Lamps, fans, space heaters, and small kitchen appliances all become voice-controlled. You can create routines like ""good morning"" that turns on your coffee maker and bedroom lights at once.

Some people use them for safety too - turning off curling irons or straighteners remotely when they can't remember if they unplugged them.

**Making Your Choice**

The smart plug that works best with voice assistants depends on which ecosystem you're already using. If you have multiple voice assistants at home, grab one that supports all of them. You'll save yourself headaches down the road.

Price matters too, but cheap options often have connectivity problems or stop working after a few months. Mid-range models usually hit the sweet spot between cost and reliability.

Ready to make your home smarter? Check out [these highly-rated smart plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug) that work seamlessly with popular voice assistants. You can compare features, read reviews, and find one that fits your specific needs.

The setup process is straightforward enough that you'll have everything running within 15 minutes. Once you start controlling devices with your voice, you'll wonder why you didn't do this sooner. Whether you're team Alexa, Google, or Siri, there are solid options available.

Don't overthink it - pick a reliable smart plug, get it set up, and start enjoying hands-free control of your home devices. You can browse compatible options and current deals [right here](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug) to get started today.",1,1764577901.0,UmmProducts,1,1.0,False

Not even close.

I’ve spent enough time around animals, cats especially, to know how a body is supposed to move. This thing lurched. A sloppy, side-to-side wobble, like a drunk toddler taking its first steps. Every clumsy shuffle closed the distance between us, and for one awful heartbeat, I got the sense it thought I was its mother, its anchor in the new world.

And that’s when the fear hit bone-deep.

I stumbled back, the cheap plastic curtain Colby had hung from the ceiling wrapping around my ankle like a dead man’s hand. My foot snagged, and I went down hard, flat on my ass against the cold concrete. The toolbox beside me skidded away with a metallic scrape, just out of reach, my fingers slipping uselessly along its smooth lid.

For a split second I wanted nothing more than to snatch it up, swing it, and turn whatever scraps of Tommy were still shambling toward me back into the same warm, formless mess I’d scooped into a plastic bag the day before.

Maybe this time I’d bury him deep enough he’d stay down.

“What the fuck is that?!” I hissed in Colby’s direction, my voice cracking somewhere between terror and fury.

He just stared down at me with that crooked smile, half proud parent, half dog that knows it’s dragged something dead onto the porch. He watched me writhing in the plastic curtain like I was some trapped possum he’d cornered for fun.

“It’s your boy!” he crowed. “All fixed up!”

Fixed.

Right.

Whatever was stuffed inside the sagging skin of that fat orange bastard must’ve heard my voice. Must’ve recognized it, because its two bulging eyes shifted. Not in unison. Not even close. They rolled lazily in their sockets, like wet marbles floating in cold soup, trying to decide which direction reality was in.

One pupil drifted sideways toward the bridge of its nose, drifting like it was caught in a slow ripple. The other wandered across the room, scanning for something, maybe looking for me, maybe for Colby, maybe for whatever it thought was its owner or maker or both.

Up close, they looked like snowballs jammed into its skull by someone who didn’t understand how eyeballs were supposed to fit. A size too big. Maybe two. Definitely not meant to be there.

I thrashed harder in the plastic bear trap Colby called a curtain, and by some miracle the cheap material finally gave way, ripping under the frantic, ugly strength of pure panic. The second my ankle came free, I lashed out with a slow, lazy kick at whatever was pretending to be Tommy.

It didn’t dodge, didn’t even try. 

It just folded.

The whole thing slumped sideways like a sack of wet grain, one eye popping half loose from the socket it had never belonged in to begin with. And Colby, the mountain of fat that was him was dropped to his knees beside it as if I’d kicked his newborn child.

The scream he let out was so raw, so animal, that for one horrible second, I almost felt guilty.

“GIVE HIM TIME TO ADJUST!” he shrieked, voice warbling and drenched in snot and hysteria. “I PROMISE HE’LL BE GOOD-BRAND NEW!”

My hand shot out toward the red toolbox, fingers closing around the cold handle of a screwdriver. I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I just moved, a sudden animal burst of adrenaline firing through my legs.

Colby noticed instantly.

Apparently, I was more important than his masterpiece.

“Man, don’t be like that!” he bellowed, and I could hear him lumbering after me, heavy, clumsy footsteps shaking the floorboards like a predator with a limp.

I scrambled toward the stairs and bolted up them on all fours, the way I used to as a kid when I wanted to feel fast. But now it wasn’t exhilarating. It was desperate, messy, painful. My knees slammed the wood; my palms slipped on dust. I could hear Colby’s ragged breath right behind me.

Then I felt it, that sudden clamp around my ankle.

Wet, greasy, disgustingly warm.

It wrapped around me like something pulled from a clogged drain.

For a heartbeat I braced myself for the yank, the violent drag backward, my teeth smashing on the steps, the tumble into the dark where Tommy waited to welcome me to whatever afterlife rejects like us ended up in. 

But the pull never came.

He just held me there while I kicked and thrashed like a trapped animal. His grip was firm but trembling, the way someone holds onto the last valuable thing they own.

I twisted around, breath sawing in and out, and met his eyes.

Those wet, stupid cow eyes. Shining with a sadness so heavy it didn’t belong on a man his size. Like I was the only thing he had left in this world.

Something in me recoiled.

Without thinking, without even aiming, I swung the screwdriver down and drove it straight into his hand.

It slid in almost too easily, like his skin had just been waiting to split.

There was a soft, sickening give as metal punched through muscle.

Colby’s grip vanished instantly.

He howled and staggered backward trying to catch onto anything as he fell down, his fat fingers sliding off the walls of the basement.

And as he fell, a quiet, shameful part of me hoped the concrete would finish what I couldn’t, snap his neck, crack his skull, silence him for good.

I didn’t hear a break or a thud, just the hollow gulp of the dark swallowing him whole. I didn’t wait for anything more. I lunged for the hatch, fingers scraping along the edge as I hauled myself up. I didn’t bother closing it. I just ran.

The porch lights were dead, the world a blur as I burst outside, nearly twisting my ankle on the slick boards. I skidded across the wet grass, scrambling upright, lungs burning. Then I threw myself into the car, jammed the key in, and kicked the engine awake.

I drove until the house vanished behind the trees, until the glow of Colby’s porch, dead and hollow, was nothing but a smudge in the rearview mirror. My hands were trembling so hard the wheel kept slipping under my fingers, the rubber feeling slick, like someone else’s grip was still on it.

A mile out, I finally let myself breathe. It came out shaky, uneven, like my lungs were trying to cough out the fear still lodged inside them. The road was empty, just a pale strip cutting through the fields, the headlights catching nothing but fog and the occasional fence post.

When I hit the first crossroads, I slowed down. Not because I wanted to, my whole body screamed at me to keep going, never look back but because I needed to know if something was behind me. I checked the mirrors once. Twice. A third time.

Nothing.

By the time I reached my street, the sky was starting to grey, just that dead, washed-out color the world gets before anything wakes up. The houses looked unfamiliar, like copies of homes I used to know. Even mine. Especially mine.

I parked crooked in the driveway, halfway onto the grass, too drained to care. The engine clicked as it cooled, each sound sharp enough to make me flinch. I sat there for a moment with my forehead against the steering wheel, just breathing, trying to remember what “safe” was supposed to feel like.

Eventually, I forced myself out. The air was damp, colder than I expected, and it slapped me awake enough to move. Gravel crunched under my shoes as I walked to the door, every step slow. My legs felt like they still remembered the basement, like they expected hands to grab them again any second.

The key almost slipped out of my fingers when I tried to unlock the door. I hadn’t realized how stained my hands were until I saw the dark, dried streaks under the porch light. His blood. Mine. I didn’t know. I didn’t want to know.

I shut the door behind me and leaned on it, eyes closed, letting the familiar smell of dust and old wood settle around me. For a second, it helped.

I kicked off my shoes, letting them fall wherever, and walked to the kitchen. The lights flickered on, too bright after the dark, and I had to squint. The room was untouched, same mugs by the sink, same half-empty cereal box, same note on the fridge I’d meant to throw away a week ago.

But even after I locked the door, deadbolt, chain, the whole works, my chest stayed tight, like something in me was still braced for Colby to come lurching out of the dark with that screwdriver jutting from his arm, eager to return the favor by burying it in my eyes.

I went straight to the sink and scrubbed my hands like a man trying to wash off a crime. The water ran brown, dirt, blood,rot of the basement , who knows, and the harder I scrubbed, the hotter my skin burned. I dumped the bowls and cups the moment they filled, terrified the stink of that place might cling to the ceramic, might somehow call him here like a dog following a scent trail.

That’s when the floorboard behind me creaked.

My heart didn’t just jump, it tried to claw its way out of my ribs. I spun around, fist cocked, ready to plant a punch right between those big, weepy cow eyes of his-

\-but it wasn’t Colby.

It was Samantha.

She squinted at me from the doorway, her face half-lit, half-lost in shadow, looking more confused than scared.

“What are you doing?” she asked, voice thick with sleep.

I had never been so relieved to see another human being in my life. Something inside me cracked open. I rushed to her and wrapped her up, clutching her like some kid who stayed up past bedtime watching a horror flick and then realized he still had to walk down the hallway alone.

She smiled, small, tired and looped her arms around me, though they hung weakly, like she barely had the strength to hold her own weight.

“It’s okay,” she whispered against my shoulder. “You should get some rest.”

I pulled back just to make sure she was real, that her eyes weren't a pair of glass Christmas decorations.

“I didn’t hear you come in,” she murmured, brushing her thumb over the side of my hand. “You’re shaking.”

“Yeah” I whispered “Rough night”

I just replied, feeling myself sinking deeper into her embrace with every passing second.

Thankfully, she didn’t push for details. If she had, I wasn’t sure what would’ve spilled out. 

She just squeezed my wrist and stepped past me, grabbing a towel off the counter to wipe the water I’d splashed everywhere. She moved slowly, like everything hurt. Or maybe she was just that tired.

“You’re gonna crash hard in a minute,” she said, voice soft, almost patient. “Just… go lie down. I’ll clean the rest.”

I nodded, swallowing the knot in my throat. The tension in my body was still buzzing like static, but I didn’t argue. I felt stripped raw, like a thin-skinned version of myself.

She guided me toward the doorway with a warm, steady hand on my back. I managed a nod, or something close to it, and drifted down the hall. I don’t remember getting to the bedroom. I don’t remember lying down. One heartbeat I was upright, the next I was gone, sinking into the mattress.

Sleep didn’t come gently. It came in crushing waves, thick darkness, then a flash of memory so sharp it felt like glass. Over and over, the same moment.

The screwdriver sinking into his hand.

My brain, ever the showman, decided to ramp up the production.

Now let’s see it in slow motion!

Some deranged director living behind my eyes shouted it like a carnival barker.

And suddenly it all stretched out, inch by awful inch, the push of metal against skin, the way it puckered before it tore, the sickening give of flesh parting around the steel. The color of it, the heat of it, the way his breath hitched wetly in shock. Every frame a little clearer than it had any right to be.

When the show finally sputtered to an end, I came to with the bed half-cold beside me. Samantha was already gone, of course, she was. At least one of us had some damn sense of manners, or mortals, as my scrambled brain tried to call it. She hadn’t had the heart to wake me. 

There was no refund for the night’s entertainment unless you counted the puddle of drool glued to my pillow. I peeled my cheek off it with a wet smack that felt far too loud in the empty room.

For a split second, I let myself pretend the whole thing had been a fever dream, one of those sweaty, delirious nightmares you laugh about later but never really forget. But reality settled in fast. My body told the truth before my mind could lie: muscles stiff like I’d run a marathon through broken glass, a skull-throb pounding behind my eyes like a truck tire had used my head for a speed bump.

Yesterday happened.

All of it.

I walked into the kitchen, made myself a cup of black coffee, and sipped it between bites of yesterday’s stale sandwich. Then another long, scalding shower, scrubbing myself until my skin felt new, or at least separate from the night before. Fresh clothes, keys in hand, and I got in the car.

Half of me wanted to go to work and pretend nothing had happened.

The other half wanted to walk into the nearest police station, even if I had nothing that would make sense to say.

I went with the first option.

So I spent the morning taking X-rays of dogs that swallowed things they shouldn’t, socks batteries, God knows what else, checking tabbies whose kidneys were finally waving the white flag, smiling and nodding whenever the job required it.

I was in the middle of a routine checkup on a green parrot named Polly, who kept lunging for my stethoscope like it owed her money, when my phone buzzed in my pocket, slow and lazy at first.

Then again.

And again.

A steady, insistent tremor, like it was tapping its foot and waiting for me to get a clue.

I finally excused myself and pulled it out.

The screen was a mess of missed calls from Samantha.

Dozens of them.

And beneath those, message after message stacking on top of each other, flooding the screen so fast the notifications blurred into a single smear of panic.

I didn’t even think, I called her back immediately. My mind sprinted ahead of the ringing, car crash, her parents, the house on fire, God forbid another damn cat. Every worst-case scenario piled on top of the next.

But when she picked up, she wasn’t crying.

She was breathless.

Happy.

Almost vibrating through the speaker.

“SOMEONE FOUND TOMMY!” she practically screamed, her voice cracking with joy.

And for a second, the world just stopped.

“What?” The word tore out of me, strangled, thin, like my own voice didn’t believe what it was saying. Like it already knew, the lie should’ve collapsed by now.

“He just, came in!” Samantha rushed on, breathless, almost tripping over her own excitement. “Some fat guy, middle-aged, kind of sweaty, asking if we’d lost a cat!”

My stomach bottomed out.

“And he had Tommy,” she said, and the joy in her voice felt like a knife sliding between my ribs. “He had him, babe. Said he found him wandering near the outskirts of town. He’s a little dirty but otherwise he’s fine! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?”

Her voice cracked on the last word.

I didn’t answer.

Because I could believe it.

And my hands had started to shake.

“Babe? Babe, are you there? Can I drop him off soon? I want you to check him out- y’know, make sure no cat messed with him.”

She’d said cat, not car, but it didn’t matter. My brain snagged on the wrongness of all of it, the impossible overlap of truth and nightmare. I still couldn’t believe any of it was happening. Couldn’t believe the lie hadn’t detonated in my face.

My hand dragged across my forehead, and only then did I notice how slick it was, sweat beading at my hairline like I’d just sprinted a mile.

“Yeah… yeah,” I muttered. My voice sounded far away, like it belonged to someone calmer than I was. “Drop him by… anytime. Whenever.”

I hung up before she could hear the panic creeping in through my teeth.

The phone slipped back into my pocket, disappearing into the dark like something I didn’t want to look at. The leftover notifications still buzzed against my leg, faint, persistent, like a ghost tapping from inside a coffin lid.

I turned back to Polly and her owner, forcing a smile that barely fit on my face.

“She’s fine,” I said, voice thin. “See you next month.”

But the thought kept chewing at me, buzzing in my skull like flies crowding a fresh corpse, ribs of truth jutting out from under the rotting lie I’d wrapped around everything.

Then I just folded.

Sat down on the cold tile floor beneath one of the cabinet shelves, knees drawn in, like I was ducking from gunfire, only I could hear.

I stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, time stretching thin and strange, until I heard footsteps coming down the hall.

Samantha.

I pushed myself up fast, pretending I’d just dropped something, like I’d been crouched down hunting for a pen that rolled away instead of hiding behind the cabinet like a nervous wreck. But the truth was sitting right there on the counter in front of me, a blue cat carrier. The thing I’d really lost stuffed neatly inside it like evidence.

She rounded the table, saw me, and practically launched herself at me. Her arms wrapped tight, too tight, squeezing the air out of my lungs. I felt like an almost-empty tube of toothpaste, one good press away from spilling whatever guts I have left in me.

“ISN'T IT EXCITING? Our little family is whole again!”

She beamed at me, that wide white grin of hers almost too bright, then pulled away just enough to press a kiss to my lips. I prayed it didn’t taste like rot. She gave the carrier a gentle tap before looking back up at me.

“So, when are you getting off?”

“In like an hour… half an hour.”

My eyes were glued to the carrier. No way in hell was I staying here for an hour. Not now.

“Great!”

Samantha grinned and leaned down to peek inside, giving whatever was in there a tiny, cheerful wave.

“See ya soon, buddy. Have fun with daddy, alright?”

Her voice went soft, sweet before she straightened again.

“Oh, and the guy slipped me his phone number, just in case.” She said it like she was offering me a coupon from the Sunday paper. “He told me he didn’t need this junk anymore, but if you could call him and maybe drop it off after you bring Tommy home? That’d be just great.”

“Phone number?”

The words fell out of my mouth like I’d never heard the term before, like telephone was some new plague spreading through town.

She snorted. “I didn’t know you were the jealous type!”

That smirk of hers cut across her face like a fresh knife mark. “Not in a creepy way, alright? Just… y’know.”

“How did he look?”

She screwed up her face, digging around in her brain like the memory was stuck behind cobwebs.

“Uhhh… fat guy. Real pale. And he reeked, God, he reeked…of like…” She rotated her hand, searching.

“Bleach?” I offered.

“Yeah. Yeah, like chemicals and cigarette smoke had a baby and then left it in a hot car.”

She glanced around the room again, like something in here might suddenly explain itself if she stared hard enough.

“But… how did you know, though?”

“He stopped by here a couple times,” I said. My tongue felt too big in my mouth. “With a cat.”

“OOOHH. Alright, got it!”

She laughed, bright and careless, like nothing in the world had ever gone wrong. “Yeah, see you in a bit! Love you!”

I watched her leave, watched the shape of her slip away from the doorframe and vanish down the hall like a ghost.

Now I was alone with it, sitting on my table like a package someone should have burned instead of delivered. I didn’t know if I was ready to see how he looked all “adjusted.” My hand drifted to the scalpel. Cold metal, thin as a whisper, steady in my grip. I squeezed it until the handle bit into my palm. After what I’d done with that screwdriver, I figured I could manage this, too.

I unlatched the crate. One piece of metal slid off another with a sound like a tired machine screaming in its sleep. The door swung open with a long, rusty whine, like something that had been left out in the rain too many nights.

I stepped back, wedging myself between two wooden shelves painted white. Funny thought, the blood splatter would look beautiful against that clean backdrop if this thing decided to go for my throat.

Instead, an orange shape eased out of the carrier.

And a sound followed.

A purr. A warm, rolling, family purr.

Not the metallic, broken rattle I’d heard before. Not forced, not wrong.

This one was soft, organic.

The scalpel slid out of my hand, clattering against the floor as my fingers uncurled in something like relief, weak, shaky, stupid relief.

Because it looked like Tommy.

The fat bastard who’d been reduced to a bloody street pancake was somehow back again. Standing there. Breathing. Purring. A perfect, uncanny copy dropped straight out of some cosmic printer. Sure, one of the hind legs dragged just a hair, and one eye drifted a little too far left, as if it couldn’t quite remember where the world was supposed to be but it was him.

It was fucking him, in all his high-cholesterol, hairball-hoarding glory.

I dug out my phone, thumb trembling just enough to piss me off. The second the screen lit up, I dialed Samantha.

“I’ll be late,” I said, already rehearsing the lie in my head. “I need to run some extra checkups on Tommy… an hour, maybe?”

It rolled off my tongue too easily. That was the part that scared me, how natural lying had become, like slipping into a pair of worn shoes.

And before I knew it, I was back in the car, engine coughing to life. The blue carrier sat on the passenger seat like evidence of a crime. I was driving out to return it to its rightful owner.

[Delonghi Dedica]","Like many others, I took advantage of Black Friday to buy a Delonghi Dedica. I had been using a very basic coffee maker from a generic brand (Cecotec Barista Mini), and it was a good opportunity to take a small step up...

 I spent the whole weekend setting it up and testing it, but I haven't been able to make a decent espresso with the Dedica.

I've been using the same coffee I used with the old machine, and I've tried the pressurized filters that come with it (I also used pressurized filters with the old machine). I know it's not the best coffee possible, but it should be the easiest extraction experience and at least allow me to see what the machine is capable of.

 My problem starts here: I haven't managed to get a good extraction yet. The coffee comes out SUPER WATERY, it doesn't produce any crema, and the taste is super bitter. The coffee is a far cry from what I got with the old coffee maker, even though it was clearly a worse machine.

I've read everywhere that the first 4 or 5 coffees don't come out right, but I've had too many of those already. 

Help me, friends. I'm sad that I can't get the most out of my new purchase. Is there something I'm missing? By the way, the steam output isn't completely continuous; it comes out in little bursts. Is that normal?",1,1764577435.0,espresso,8,1.0,False
