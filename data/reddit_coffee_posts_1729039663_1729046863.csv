Either this will work and help me meet someone, get ignored and laughed at (in which case I'm back to where I started anyway). In any case I would have contributed to society. 

This semester I'm mostly lifting weights and occasionally playing badminton. It's difficult to get a good game because I'm not a beginner but not pro either and there are few others who are like me. I'd love to play a game if you're down.

Something I would really like to do socially is actually my interest for science fiction. I've been a big fan of the genre and grew up stealing my Dad's books to read by myself. What now excites me is to write some of it instead of just reading it. I'm embarrassed to admit it because now it's so mainstream, but I'm a massive fan of the Dune series. Watching Dune part 1 in the theater was almost a religious experience for me. Some scenes in Dune 2 were great but overall it was a massive letdown.

Things I've tried in the past and no longer do, but could talk to you about if you're interested:

- Ballroom and swing dancing
- Iranian Students Foundation (I'm not Iranian, maybe that's why I didn't feel like I belonged here).
- Jewish life on campus (used to do a lot of this but not anymore).

Please send me a DM if this interests you and we can grab coffee and go and sit on McKeldin Mall!

Happy to send pictures if you want.

1g4p7v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1g4p7v9/venting_about_my_hellish_3month_and_counting/,Venting About My Hellish 3-Month (and Counting) Post-College Job Hunt,"I really don't care if anyone sees this, I just need to get this off my chest.

I had heard about how hard it is to get hired after graduating, but OH MY GOD, it is so much worse than I ever could have imagined.

So I went to college (a very average school--nowhere fancy but a decently well-known, legitimate, local university) and I got my bachelor's degree. I also worked the same, full-time job for three years as a student. Given this, I naively thought ""oh yeah I can get a job no problem."" To be clear, my expectations were not high at all. I knew I wouldn't be working in the field I studied and got a degree in. I innocently believed that having a bachelor's degree (+3 years of related prior work experience) would be able to get me the most bog standard, basic office job. But after 50+ applications to a variety of jobs like this (all of which specified little to no experience and an associate's degree as the minimum qualifications), I have had zero luck. I've gotten three interviews and that's it. The part that pisses me off the most is how damn long it takes to even get a response. I've waited up to a month and a half only to randomly get an automated email saying ""this position has been filled"" or ""this position has been withdrawn."" I did an interview a MONTH ago that I have STILL not heard back about--I emailed one of the recruiters to ask if I was still being considered, and they said they are still ""working on it."" That was over a week ago now. To clarify, THIS IS A $14 AN HOUR POSITION THAT IS BASICALLY JUST A GLORIFIED RECEPTIONIST POSITION. Why the hell is it taking over a month for me to even hear back about this!?

When I realized it was going to take a while to find a ""real job"", I decided to look for employment elsewhere in retail/fast food/etc. to help bring in some extra money. I thought this, at least, would be easy enough. In college, I worked summer jobs at places like this, and the hiring process never took more than a week or so. That's why I am sitting here, two-and-a-half weeks after applying to well over a dozen of these jobs, totally baffled. I am not applying to work at the fucking White House or whatever--I applied to places like Kroger and IHOP. What is the delay? I genuinely do not understand--why was I, as a student, able to get a job at places like this so much more easily than I, as a graduate with a degree? It should be the opposite, right? I thought the reason I went and got a degree in the first place was because that would HELP ME GET A JOB!

And the worst part about this is that I have NO ONE to vent to this about irl because it's just so embarrassing to even talk about, to have to admit that ""yeah I've been unemployed for three months, even though I've been trying very hard."" There's also a psychological element of guilt I feel whenever I spend money on anything besides groceries or rent that's caused me to feel uncomfortable on doing fun things to take my mind off this mess (I can't go to a coffee shop or go see a movie without my brain whispering ""you're unemployed. you shouldn't be wasting money on unnecessary things like this!""). And the process of finding/applying to jobs is so damn exhausting on top of that. I just keep refreshing my email over and over and over again every day, expecting a job offer to be there--or at least an offer for an interview, only to get nothing and feeling really upset. Having to endure all this has been so discouraging and depressing.",1,1729046121.0,recruitinghell,2,1.0,False

I(f25)  got on hinge and met  M(34) we have a good amount in common and plan on getting coffee on Friday.  I've known him 2 weeks and we had one phone conversation that went well, But he complimented me like 20 times throughout the 2 hour convo, I mean at some point  you stop being able to reply and it just kinda kills the conversation?

once I felt that it was excessive i laid it out gently and explained that I'm not sure what to say, and maybe pace it if thats something he enjoyed but that i accept his complemmts and its kindnof him to share but the excess made me a bit uncomfortable. He was very sweet about it, but in the next 20 minutes he kept the same pace but added an apology after. This confused me but i didnt say anythig because i thought maybe hes just nervous? Ofc I understand wanting to compliment someone you like I just don't understand why he felt the need to say every single one that pops in his head

I'm giving him the benifit of the doubt because I feel that  this may  just be in my head and that I need to get over my ""compliment ick"", he seems genuinely nice, and kind,  and I'm a pretty good judge of character, he doesn't seem weird or anything I just can't get the excessive complementing out of my head and need someone to tell me if im crazy or if this is an ick  for others too?

My main goal is to meet a woman but I want a place I can go and enjoy regardless and without the sole purpose of finding someone.

I've never been to a bar and wouldnt know what to do besides stare at a wall (also none of my friends want to go with me)

I would feel uncomfortable in a cafe, I dont read or drink coffee. Though I may try it at some point. But talking to a woman at a cafe would feel like I'm just bothering these poor lady's.

I dont think any hiker is going to stop and want to talk to strangers.

I wouldnt know what class to take and I dont think we have much around me.

Maybe I've spent to much time being antisocial and I'm the problem. Any advice would be great and I'm willing to go out of my comfort zone as long as I know what I'm getting into. Again my main goal wouldnt be meeting woman, but I would like that rare chance that it would happen.

What brought me into love addiction recovery places was my issue with having emotional affairs. Right now, I'm having rumination because another female co-worker has ghosted me. It started with me saving her parking spot, emails but nothing personal, then bam. No contact. 

This is not the only female worker who has ghosted me. Another one years ago in 2018, when she was emailing me and chatting with me, all of a sudden just ghosted me, what triggered it I have no idea. I used to make coffee for the office and some didn't want any, some did, and now, that is a daily reminder of how my limerence begins and ends. I get ghosted. I guess I need these harsh reminders that I am here to work and not fool around. My cycle proves that I can't have any female friends, it's completely obvious to me. Anyway, I am working on what is causing my cycles of limerence and triggers and pre-triggers and who to be in a calm, sober state not seeking any attention from women. At work, it's getting easier, and I don't even want to make any eye contact with anyone, even if they are honestly trying to just do work and be profession, I can't stand making any eye contact now and I can't stand it when someone is a female customer and I have to help. 



I become like a robot now without any emotions and kind of dead inside now. But honestly, this is how I prefer it, because if I was the other way, it would be all happy and flirtatious and I am so very tired of going down this route and I need to be with integrity. I also shared some of my issues in a men only addiction meeting I attend once a week. Then we prayed together. Anyways, I hope you are doing ok and getting help for whatever issues you are current facing. This is crazy and sinister.

Today, I made amends with a situationship and found closure in our relationship. We both realized that it would be best for us to remain friends just like we used to since we had been using our connection to distract ourselves from the pain caused by our long-term exes.

Having an open conversation about our feelings was truly a wake-up call for me. It‚Äôs time for me to focus on personal growth and become the woman I‚Äôm meant to be. I also want to get back into reading, as I believe that embarking on this journey of self-discovery will be incredibly beneficial!

I‚Äôd love some book recommendations for a young female audience (I‚Äôm 21). I‚Äôm looking for books that explore themes of self-love, self-worth, moving on, and most importantly, being OKAY with and PROUD of being single.

My goal is to become an independent, strong woman who doesn‚Äôt rely on a man for happiness. If the right person comes along, I want to view him not as my other half, but as a whole individual with his own feelings and complexities‚Äîand they just so happen to be my boyfriend who I love deeply. 

I prefer to pick up a copy of the book at a bookstore like Barnes & Noble just because I like to have a physical copy to look cute while reading at a coffee shop or keep in my tote bag hehe! I could search online, but I feel like I can get the best book recommendations from people who are going through/have gone through a similar experience to me!

1g4oqg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1g4oqg0/solutions_to_a_bad_gay_dating_life/,Solutions To A Bad Gay Dating Life,"I get hookups, both via apps, and in parties/clubs/in person basically but one of 2 things happen:

a) Post hookup, thats it really, maybe a message or two a few months later, but I've moved on by then and honestly and not interested as most of my hookups are 'meh' at best. There doesn't seem this 'urge' to see eachother again. Guys claim they are looking for FWB etc but it almost never happens.

b) They are visiting, enter a relationship, we don't click, they become OF/escort (so only looking for money, I have no issue hooking up again with them just to be clear) etc etc etc.

I've dropped my standards over the years with hookups (despite 'working on myself' and looking better than ever / health being top notch / work etc being solid / travel plans in full motion etc). I've never targeted someone 8/10+ (IG type guys) but even the most basic guys are just cringe. I would say when I am hit on in clubs etc, it is really binary i.e. a really hot guy who is clearly 'above' me and probably sees me as an 'easy' target, or someone I really don't find attractive enough to even make out with. I know personality/judgement etc comments will come my way, but let's be real, if the outer package isn't tingling your tastebuds (even if it is 'just a hookup'), I struggle to see why I should bother (I can get myself off just fine). Even with most hookups, the guys seem like real assholes, half the time breeding me and not even caring if I cum for example...

Dating is basically crickets and getting worse each year I try. Matches happen so my profile is not the issue. But the types of guys on there are just really bad imo - both physically and mentally - and I really am struggling to find a match to even want to have a coffee date with (still, I push myself to try, but more often than not its a dead end). I'm not 10/10 by any means, and I don't look for a 6 pack etc, but the serious lack of wholesome kissable faces in general, and any sign of moral character, is making me cringe. It is the same conversations, flakiness, same types of guys out there, and I'm bored out of my mind. I've taken breaks, and everytime I come back with a positive mind, I'm met with an even bigger shit. I read a lot of Reddit posts, and know a lot of people around me in relationships who seek my counsel, and most people just seem miserable.

I don't know who said ""be the person you want to date"" because I legitimately can't find even 50% of myself on the dating market at all (in 1 person). I also keep reading stuff like ""the best are taken"" and ""it will happen when you are not looking"" but I think both statements are completely untrue from what I have learnt over the years about how people are ending up together, and what types 'connect'.

Instead of wasting my time on social media or otherwise, I've figured out, with all the extra time, how to make some stable passive side income (several thousands per month which is awesome). With this, I'm tempted to hire an escort (the same one weekly) to start to have something more continuous at least and 'build that muscle' (pun intended haha), as this doesn't seem to be happening through hookups or dating or anything 'free' so to speak. And I'm at loss what else I can do to live a fuller life if the guys are just so bad through the normal avenues I look through. It is worth noting that even then half these escort guys also don't even respond or take a while to respond! But for the $ they at least are nice and incentivised to please you.

Are there any other solutions I can execute on to improve the situation? I know an escort path is not 'real' but I still think it would be much better than the low quality hookups and dates I'm currently experiencing.

Before I also get downvoted: I'm sure I will get comments like ""at least you get hookups/dates"" but honestly, is it even worth it when its so bad? It's like saying ""at least you get food"" but all the food is expired and tastes bad. Rather not eat.",3,1729044580.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

1g4opey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beermkr/comments/1g4opey/diy_recipe_nit_wit/,DIY Recipe - Nit Wit,"Been enjoying a successful DIY recipe.  It's a take on a Belgian WIT beer but it uses the yeast packet I got with the Tripel MKRkit.

Here's to a break from the doom and gloom of future BeerMKR state and a recipe to try.

* 750g Pilsner
* 575g Flaked Wheat
* 120g Flaked Oats (literally Quaker Oats)
* 100g Dextrose (Corn Sugar)
* 6600 ml water (The recipe will be 7000 total) at mash time.

Measured mash temperature during heating cycle. Grain temperature got to 150F so that's a little low.  I only started doing that recently so I don't know what par for the course is for BeerMKR where it heats the bag temp to 160F.

After the grain was removed I added 400ml of Hop Tea.

The Hop Tea was made from

* 2g Magnum hops pre-steamed in an instant pot (bittering only)
* 20g Ahtanum hops.

Boiled the 400ml of water in a teakettle and steeped the hops in a re-usable coffee filter until the temp cooled to about 160F.  This lets me use standard hops.  The Ahtanum hops give an ""orange"" flavor.

I used 4 drops of ALDC and ZERO drops of Gluten and Haze reducer.

Yeast was a sachet of Fermentis WB06.  To me that's a terrible yeast for a Tripel, but it's perfect for this beer.

  
Pitch at 65F.

Lag at 73F

Primary 240Hrs at 68

Rest 96 Hrs at 71

Crash/Clarify 40F 48Hrs (it won't get clear)

Mine came in at about 6.5% ABV

This is a hazy wheat beer that's a bit like a strong Blue Moon.  It is a fruity wheat beer with the WB06 giving it that estery/fruity flavor.  The Ahtanum hops give it a flavor like orange was added.  This is the first time I've used hops for flavor on my own and I'm really pretty pleased.

Biggest problem I've had is: ""oh it's a Wit"" and bumped up the carbonation.  Umm. there's lots of wheat and oat protien in this so it REALLY holds a head.  I have to have a glass handy and poised and start pouring immediately because it really foams too much.  Next time less priming sugar (and apparently I didn't record the priming sugar amount in my notes).",1,1729044493.0,Beermkr,0,1.0,False

For months i was sharing my sisters outbursts, anger, threats, but then being nice and asking for help- with my therapist. She shared this sounds like BPD. 

Then I found this community and I‚Äôve spent hours crying and reading your posts. 

My sister has a lot of health issues, so when she outbursts, freaks out screaming upset about not finding her glasses, or how her coffee was wrong, I just figured ‚Äúwell she is 75 % blind and has multiple illnesses, I would be angry all the time too‚Äù.  

But my therapist tells me that‚Äôs not true, often people who are blind, or struggle with health issues are some of the smartest and kindest and well spoken people. They aren‚Äôt all angry and have outbursts and act like victims. 

My sister will freak out and only call ME. She used to freak out in person but lost all relationships and friendships. 

But now she only calls me. No one else knows about her outbursts. 

She screams that she‚Äôs mad about this or that or her landlord or whatever. And I listen. And listen for hours on end every day. I wonder if my phone would say how many hours we stayed on the phone. 

I try to help. I used to go over her house at every ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù and I realized how much time I was spending. She moved 30 mins away and now I don‚Äôt go over unless she really needs me. Which I feel GUILTY ABOUT! 

Does anyone else feel this way? 

Guilty about not helping more, but trying to balance how much I protect myself and my health and wellness too. 

The stress, the sadness after each phone call. I sometimes have to dissociate to make it through the calls. She doesn‚Äôt really want advice to helps- I think she wants me to save or fix the problems. But I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve tried. And it‚Äôs never ever good enough.

Hi all,

In 2020 I (32F) had a falling out with a friend of mine after I behaved poorly on a camping trip. I didn't recognize my behavior at the time, but when she explained it, I absolutely understood where she was coming from. I overdrank as well as just violated her boundaries. I was someone who made a lot of gross sexual innuendos and stuff that made people uncomfortable. Looking back now, I also wouldn't be friends with me.

Awhile later, I think 2021, we tried re-kindling our friendship, but unfortunately I fucked up. She had invited me up to a cabin, but I didn't realize the plans were finalized/confirmed. It didn't seem set in stone. I had posted on social media a photo with another friend, and this friend called me out for ditching her. In good faith, I explained the mistake and deeply apologized. She let me know that she didn't think the friendship was good/healthy for her at the time.

I understand where she was coming from even if it was human error. She had tried to give me a second chance, and it blew up. Even if it wasn't my fault, I understand that impulse to do that.

I've been thinking about her a lot lately and how I would be interested in trying to rekindle our friendship. I'm getting closer to actually reaching out. My question is - is the text below an appropriate thing to send to her? I don't want to inadvertently cause more harm.

Thank you so much.

>Hi \[Friend\],

>I hope all is well with you. I‚Äôve been thinking about you lately and I wanted to reach out and see how you are doing. I‚Äôm really sorry for how our friendship ended.¬†

>Since then, I‚Äôve done a lot of work to try to detangle my toxic traits and behaviors that I did that drove people away. This includes bringing awareness to respecting the boundaries friends set, not over drinking, and just altogether trying to be a more aware friend sensitive to the needs of others. I am sorry for not doing this work sooner while we were friends.

>Please let me know if you‚Äôd be ok with catching up. Maybe over a cup of coffee? If you are not,I completely understand. Either way, I wish you the best.

Although for the record I do find you extremely attractive and if you did decide you felt that way, I would definitely not be closed off.

I really wanted to build a solid friendship with you before I left, but seeing as there is so little time before that happens- it might not happen, which is disappointing. But I do want you to know, that even if I leave and we never get the chance to talk again- you have had an unexpected positive impact on me- you are quite literally the kindest, most respectful, purest, most genuine, and mature person I have ever had the privilege of meeting and I would like the chance to get to know you better and maybe even become friends if you are down for that?

1g4o7jp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1g4o7jp/wows_new_warband_economy_and_how_it_compares_to_a/,WoW's new warband economy and how it compares to a theory/question I have to the real world.,"How warband's changed the economy for World of Warcraft? Can this be used as a simulation for real world economics?

With warbands and the warband bank you can now transfer gold around from server to server without having to spend real life money to transfer a character to a new server. The warband bank is currently maxed out at 99,999,999 gold, 10x what a character can hold. With this in mind your warband is in essence the economic powerhouse of 10 toons unbound to any realm. 

What implications does this have for the economy and how does this relate to real world economics?

Well for the gold whales, that were already in control their local realm's auction house, quite probably also swapping gold for tokens, character transfers, and essentially becoming the infamous Auction House Mafia. Warbands probably streamlined this process for these types of individuals or collection of individuals. Nothing is in their way anymore from simply fixing prices, controlling these markets even more efficiently. I don't play the auction house except to sell the transmog I farmed like 3+ years ago that still haven't sold, I don't know nor care to know who are these Gold Goblins that have been notorious on this subreddit in regards to reporting players that encroach on their AH profits. This whole matter has me curious where's the fun if you are pretty much the Jeff Bezos of Azeroth? Do you still enjoy the game once you have all the purchasable transmogs, mounts, pets. Is the AH mafia actually part of a large malicous gold farming operation? Who knows...

  
I retract, the goal of this post isn't to go down a rabbit hole of conspiracies as to the philosophy of owning such a ridiculous amount of virtual wealth, even if it correlates to real life tangible wealth and how it equates to happiness. I have a feeling that whatever entity has amassed this unfathomable amount of gold, is probably still farming for Invincible's Reins. My true goal with this post is partially my curiosity to why blizzard would allow the markets to now be easier to manipulate. Will this Auction House Mafia bring balance to the economy, make it crash, or cause prices to become unfathomably expensive for the average player? I realize as I continue with this idea, I can't help but find myself asking more and more questions.

So, is blizzard watching the economy to see how it reacts to this change, is this part of some Harvard economic experiment? We saw how the plague simulated a pandemic pretty well before Covid-19 happened. Whether if that was intentional or not, it did provide some results that seemed to be beneficial to research and studies. I know guys it's just a game, right? But the thought is also quite entertaining. Maybe I am the only one fascinated by this because during this summer I had a random thought/idea. What if the world economy used just a singular currency, like 1 USD equaled 1 Yen to 1 Euro? What would be the economic implications if this were to be put in to a real life scenario? It obviously would have a huge impact on a lot of different industries but I don't think this question is to far outlandish considering the rise of cryptocurrency and how it almost diminishes all other currencies in comparison as far as value go. And just like with warbands, if the world ever did agree to become ‚Äúequality-based‚Äù, this change would probably be irreversible and quite dramatic.

I've never held more than 500k gold when I attempted to go for the brutisaur mount, only paid for game time with gold once, even though I have been playing for close to 15 years but only amounted to roughly 1 year of in-game play time not accounting for the times I went afk and left the game running. Nor am I some educated individual, financial expert but thoughts like these seem fun to gather some insight.

I did ask AI for it's input on what a equal global economy would look like and this was the response I got. I took it with a grain of salt as it is probably a garbled mess of uneducated and uninformative opinions. But adding I am adding it here as I feel it helps with the vague concept. Whether this correlates with how the World of Warcraft economy is affected may be a different story but each server used to have it's own unique economy without much outside influence beside the server transfers. Which could be equated with a entrepreneur outsourcing it's labor to amass wealth in a different economical environment.

Simulating a world where all currencies are equal in value‚Äîwhere every currency is balanced at a value of 1‚Äîwould be a radical shift from the existing global economic structure. Here‚Äôs how such a world might function, along with some challenges and possible outcomes:

# 1. Elimination of Exchange Rates

* **Current Situation**: Exchange rates exist to account for differences in economic strength, monetary policies, inflation rates, and geopolitical factors.
* **In a Balanced World**: All currencies are pegged equally, meaning $1 = ¬£1 = ‚Ç¨1 = ¬•1 = ‚Çπ1, etc. There would be no exchange rate fluctuations, simplifying international trade and investments. For instance, if you earn in Indian Rupees and travel to the U.S., 1 Rupee would equal 1 Dollar.

# 2. Trade Impact

* **Current Situation**: Countries like China or Germany may have trade surpluses due to competitive advantages (e.g., cheaper labor, technology, or resource efficiency).
* **In a Balanced World**: Without currency devaluation or inflationary differences, nations would need to rely solely on the quality and efficiency of goods and services to compete. Cost advantages would no longer stem from currency differences but purely from productivity, technology, labor costs, and other domestic factors. This might create an even playing field for nations that struggle due to weaker currencies.

# 3. Global Labor Market

* **Current Situation**: Wages vary greatly between countries. A software engineer in the U.S. earns far more than one in India or China, partially because of currency differences.
* **In a Balanced World**: Labor would become far more mobile, as people could earn equal wages for the same work across borders. Countries with lower living costs might become hubs for industries that require lower wages, as wages adjust to this new standard. The concept of wage arbitrage would diminish, potentially driving up wages in poorer countries while reducing them in wealthier ones.

# 4. Inflation and Monetary Policy

* **Current Situation**: Central banks control inflation and economic growth by adjusting interest rates and monetary supply, which affect the value of a currency.
* **In a Balanced World**: With equal currency values, central banks would lose a major tool of economic policy‚Äîcurrency devaluation. They would need to rely on other mechanisms like taxation and regulation to control inflation or stimulate growth. However, without currency fluctuation as a buffer, economies might become more vulnerable to shocks. Countries that experience inflation would still see prices rise, but they couldn‚Äôt let their currency ‚Äúfloat‚Äù to account for it.

# 5. Investment and Debt

* **Current Situation**: Many developing nations attract foreign investment by offering high returns due to weaker currencies. On the other hand, wealthier nations often enjoy low-interest loans and investments due to the strength of their currencies.
* **In a Balanced World**: With no currency strength to leverage, investors would assess projects based purely on the return on investment, rather than currency arbitrage or interest rate differentials. Countries with weaker governance or riskier markets would struggle more to attract capital unless they offered other competitive advantages. Countries with significant debt might struggle to repay loans since they could no longer devalue their currency to ease the burden of debt repayment.

# 6. Global Price Convergence

* **Current Situation**: Goods and services cost differently in each country based on currency value, cost of living, and local economic conditions.
* **In a Balanced World**: Prices would begin to converge globally, as currency equalization would eliminate price differences caused by exchange rates. A cup of coffee, for example, might cost the same in Tokyo, New York, and Nairobi, adjusted for local costs of living and resources. Over time, prices might still vary due to supply chains, labor costs, and taxes, but the extreme price differences we see today would diminish.

# 7. Tourism and Global Mobility

* **Current Situation**: Travelers often choose destinations based on currency value. Some countries benefit from tourism because their weaker currency makes them more affordable.
* **In a Balanced World**: Travel would become more predictable and accessible for everyone. Wealthier nations could no longer offer a premium ‚Äúluxury‚Äù experience just because of a strong currency, and poorer countries could no longer rely on ‚Äúcheap tourism‚Äù as a major economic engine. The tourism industry would need to focus more on quality, experience, and innovation.

# 8. Wealth Distribution

* **Current Situation**: Currency differences exacerbate global wealth inequality. Nations with strong currencies have more purchasing power and economic influence.
* **In a Balanced World**: While the equalization of currency wouldn‚Äôt solve inequality by itself, it might force wealthier nations to rethink their trade policies, aid, and international investment. Poorer nations could use the new parity to leverage better terms for trade and development projects. However, underlying structural issues like education, infrastructure, and corruption would still need to be addressed to improve overall wealth distribution.

# 9. Speculative Financial Markets

* **Current Situation**: Currency trading (forex) is one of the largest markets in the world, as traders make money by predicting fluctuations in currency value.
* **In a Balanced World**: The forex market would cease to exist in its current form. Speculators would no longer profit from currency differences, removing a massive component of global financial speculation. While some would argue this could reduce volatility, others would argue it could increase financial instability by removing a layer of liquidity and hedging options.

# 10. Political and Geopolitical Impact

* **Current Situation**: Powerful economies can exert political influence through currency control and foreign investments.
* **In a Balanced World**: Geopolitical power might shift as monetary influence diminishes. Nations that rely heavily on the strength of their currency to project power (like the U.S. with the dollar) could see reduced influence, while countries that are currently penalized by weaker currencies (such as many in Africa or South America) could rise in prominence. Global alliances might change as the economic playing field becomes more level.

# Challenges:

* **Transition Costs**: The transition to a 1:1 currency balance would be incredibly disruptive. Current wealth, savings, and prices would need to be recalibrated, which could create winners and losers across nations and industries.
* **Loss of Economic Flexibility**: Countries would no longer be able to use currency manipulation as a tool for economic recovery or competitiveness.
* **Cultural and Social Effects**: Economic decisions are often influenced by local values, which would come into sharper conflict when currencies are equalized. For instance, nations with high social safety nets might need to cut services or raise taxes to remain competitive.

# Possible Outcomes:

* **Greater Equality Among Nations**: In the long run, a more balanced economic system could reduce inequality and offer smaller economies a fairer share of the global economy.
* **Economic Shocks**: Removing the buffer provided by currency differences might make economies more vulnerable to shocks, such as pandemics, wars, or commodity price changes.
* **Restructuring of Global Systems**: International institutions like the IMF and World Bank would need to restructure their operations, focusing on productivity, development, and cooperation instead of lending and currency stabilization.

In conclusion, a world where all currencies are equal would bring significant benefits in terms of global equality and fairness but would also introduce immense challenges in economic stability and governance. It would require global cooperation and new ways of managing economies.",0,1729042926.0,wow,2,0.33,False

Higher Beings are of a different kind. ","Spiritual, multidimensional, timeless and spaceless. Please think about this words. They describe entities that only partially exist or penetrate our reality. Keep in mind their ‚Äúother part‚Äù is in realm unimaginable to us.

¬†¬† How is that possible? Thought experiment: Downscale our 3D world to 2D as if we are people on a flat sheet of paper, and higher dimension, represented by a cube can go through our flat world and at every moment of time there would be only a single ‚Äúslice‚Äù of a cube inside the sheet of paper fabric.

But that‚Äôs not it! Aliens are not material higher dimensional cubes. They are something ‚Äú3D‚Äù that feels in our imaginable ‚Äú2D‚Äù world as narratives, events, stories only when it ""goes"" through us in a certain manner!¬†

Do you get it? Event types like walking to school or drinking coffee, browsing reddit - it is something you can imagine and something you can put as a goal and live through your life toward it. So the event like ‚Äúdrink coffee‚Äù is timeless and spaceless itself, fundamental as math. It happened to many people before you and will happen again. And for aliens that is one single moment and place!

**‚ÄúDrinking coffee‚Äù and all that leads to and from it is a single case that is a ‚Äúbody structure part‚Äù of an alien in our reality. Same as all other ever existed in past and existing in future TYPES of narratives and events.**

You have the illusion that you run your body. It is run by some aliens from higher realms that propagate through your consciousness that consist of narratives created and detected in time. It's probably true because neither you nor I understand for 100% what we live for, what is the goal? You live and understand reality only because you follow some ideas and goals. And their fundamental meanings are a mystery to us.

Or another example: I text you and you respond in the shortest way possible and that's not how you speak generally. You may be having a hard day or even week. If this happens over and over though, to me, you're telling me you don't want me to talk to you anymore. You're distancing yourself.

Even the words that someone uses tell me things. For instance if you use personal pronouns in every single sentence, I fear you're a narcissist.

1g4njyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1g4njyj/old_worked_for_me/,OLD worked for me,"Hi. About 2 months ago (I think) I posted about my difficulty in meeting someone. As an introvert meeting someone ""in the wild"" can seem impossible, yet OLD has also gotten difficult with all the apps now being optimized for money grabbing and all the catfishing etc. 

I had not been having success on match/stir or Bumble, and was hesitant to try more thinking it would be the same few people and just a waste of money. But I ran into someone who said to try eHarmony as they had met their wife there. So I did it, I was hesitant due to the high up front cost and number of reviews saying it had gone downhill in recent years. 

But I took the plunge. After I got my profile up I was disheartened as it appeared that there really just weren't many on there. But I looked at profiles anyway, and wow there she was. I felt a bond just reading the profile. Anyhow I messaged, we started chatting. Met for coffee the next day and talked for 4 hours. We've been inseparable ever since (minus the 45 mile distance between us üò≠). Turns out she had been on eHarmony for 3 years and I was only the 3rd person that ever messaged her, and the other 2 conversations ended shortly after they started. Her subscription was going to expire 2 weeks later and she wasn't going to renew (who could blame her). 

Anyhow, lightning struck for me, it can happen. And thank you to those who gave suggestions in my previous post ",32,1729040869.0,datingoverfifty,3,0.92,False

Brazil is known for its coffee, but I‚Äôve noticed that the U.S. market seems to have a different approach‚Äîlots of variety, flavored coffees, and a big focus on the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù of drinking coffee.

We grow high-quality beans here, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to introduce them to American coffee drinkers. I‚Äôve come across terms like ‚Äúthird wave coffee,‚Äù and honestly, I‚Äôm still wrapping my head around all the different trends.

For those of you who are coffee enthusiasts or involved in the industry, I‚Äôd love to hear any advice on what U.S. consumers are looking for and how I can best position my beans.
