It's actually something I noticed in Turkiye specifically that I never saw in any other place in the world. I'm not talking about a restaurant or a coffee shop but I suppose that in an international airport such as Istanbul Airport, international aviation laws impose than someone who works at  a check-in counter HAVE to talk the minimum of English. Sometimes, it's clear 100% that someone is from Japan or China or India and they person working at the airport is insisting on talking to him in Turkish that he will never understand in a million year and eventually after wasting a good amount of  time talks in English (It's not a complicated conversation). I'm not sure but I feel like many knows English but still insist on talking in Turkish to tourist who will never understand and if they don't know that a big problem. I'm just curious what's the thing behind this? Is it cultural/ social thing or what's the pleasure of insisting to talk to a tourist in a language he will never understand? I wrote this because I saw it tens of times happening the same way to many tourists and I traveled to many countries around the world but never saw this before.",1,1737022034.0,AskTurkey,1,1.0,False

1i2li2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamieHBrown/comments/1i2li2p/why_jamie_henry_brown_loves_systemeio_even_though/,Why Jamie Henry Brown Loves Systeme.io Even Though He Loves Russell Brunson,"Jamie Henry Brown loves a tool called Systeme.io. It’s kind of like a magic box for people who want to build online businesses. Now, Jamie is also a super fan of ClickFunnels and Russell Brunson. But guess what? Jamie has found room in his heart for both Systeme.io and ClickFunnels. Why? Let’s dive in and see why Jamie is head over heels for Systeme.io.

# What Is Systeme.io?

Systeme.io is an all-in-one tool for building a business online. You can create websites, funnels, email campaigns, and even online courses. It’s like having a whole team helping you, but it’s just one tool. And the best part? It’s easy to use, even if you’re not a tech wizard.

# Why Jamie Loves Systeme.io

Jamie loves tools that make life easier, and Systeme.io does just that. Here are some reasons Jamie can’t stop talking about it:

# 1. It’s Simple

Jamie says, “I like things that work without giving me a headache.” Systeme.io is super easy to use. You don’t need to know coding or design. It’s like coloring inside the lines; everything is laid out for you.

# 2. It’s Affordable

ClickFunnels is awesome but can be pricey, especially if you’re just starting out. Systeme.io is much cheaper, and Jamie loves saving money. “More money in my pocket means more tacos and coffee,” Jamie jokes.

# 3. All-in-One

Jamie loves having everything in one place. Systeme.io has tools for funnels, emails, courses, blogs, and more. Jamie says, “Why use ten tools when one does the job?”

# 4. Great for Beginners

If you’re new to online business, Systeme.io is like a best friend who holds your hand. Jamie loves that it helps people get started without feeling overwhelmed.

# But Wait, Jamie Still Loves ClickFunnels

Even though Jamie is all about Systeme.io, ClickFunnels is still a big deal for him. Jamie loves Russell Brunson, the guy who made ClickFunnels. Russell is like a funnel wizard who teaches people how to make money online. Jamie says, “Russell’s books and videos changed my life.”

So, why does Jamie use both Systeme.io and ClickFunnels? It’s because they each have their own superpowers. Here’s how Jamie explains it:

* **ClickFunnels**: Great for advanced funnel builders and big campaigns. Jamie uses it for fancy stuff.
* **Systeme.io**: Perfect for simple projects, beginners, and saving money.

# Features Jamie Loves in Systeme.io

Here are some cool things about Systeme.io that make Jamie smile:

# 1. Funnel Builder

Building funnels is like building a money machine. Systeme.io makes it easy to create funnels that sell products, get leads, or grow your audience. Jamie says, “It’s like playing with building blocks.”

# 2. Email Marketing

Jamie loves sending emails to his fans and customers. Systeme.io lets him send emails, create newsletters, and even set up automatic emails. It’s like having a robot helper.

# 3. Online Courses

Jamie says teaching online is a great way to make money. With Systeme.io, he can create and sell courses in one place. “It’s so easy, even my grandma could do it,” Jamie jokes.

# 4. Affiliate Program

Systeme.io has a built-in affiliate program. This means Jamie can get other people to promote his products and share the profits. “It’s like having a sales team without paying salaries,” Jamie says.

# 5. Blog Builder

Jamie loves writing (and cracking jokes), so he’s a fan of the blog feature. It lets him share tips, stories, and ideas with the world.

# How Jamie Uses Systeme.io

Jamie is a busy guy with big ideas. Here’s how he uses Systeme.io to turn those ideas into reality:

1. **Building Funnels**: Jamie creates funnels to sell his products, like ebooks and courses. He says it’s like setting up a lemonade stand but online.
2. **Email Campaigns**: Jamie keeps in touch with his audience by sending funny and helpful emails.
3. **Creating Courses**: Jamie teaches others how to build funnels and grow businesses. He loves how Systeme.io makes it easy to upload videos, create lessons, and collect payments.
4. **Writing Blogs**: Jamie shares tips about marketing, funnels, and staying unusual. He says, “Writing blogs is like talking to my friends, but they can’t interrupt me.”

# Why Systeme.io Works for Everyone

Jamie thinks Systeme.io is perfect for:

* Beginners who don’t know where to start
* People who want to save money
* Entrepreneurs who like simple tools

Jamie says, “Systeme.io is like a Swiss Army knife for business. It has everything you need.”

# Jamie Henry Brown loves both Systeme.io and ClickFunnels. They’re like peanut butter and jelly—different but awesome together. Systeme.io is simple, affordable, and perfect for beginners. ClickFunnels is powerful and great for big projects. Jamie says, “If you’re starting out or want an all-in-one tool, try Systeme.io. But if you want to learn from the master, check out Russell Brunson and ClickFunnels.”

So, there you have it. That’s why Jamie loves Systeme.io. It’s easy, affordable, and gets the job done. Jamie ends with his signature line: **Stay Unusual.**

  Hey guys! So I have a sugar date planned for tomorrow, meeting for the first time. I’ve never done this, not in person. I’ve had online only sugar daddies though. He at first said he would give me x amount for our “interview “ but that he’d be looking for more than a coffee date. 
  Now he said x amount less than original because that’s what his “other arrangement” is and wants to stick to that. However I’m not a prostitute. Also said he will give me a large amount a month to meet once a week, but wants to give me less than original offer for our meet up tomorrow? That just doesn’t make sense to me. Sorry for the vagueness, this forum won’t let me be more specific 
  Should I even go to this meet up? That’s throwing me off. Also he has a very high paying and commendable job, and I’m verifying that in person tomorrow. Not going to say the job for privacy reasons on his end. Any advice/feedback/thoughts appreciated! As long as you’re not mean, can’t handle that lolol. Thanks!

I'm in the process of renting a new flat. This is a 115 m² with an extra 10 m² office.  
From what I understood, I have 2 solutions:

1- I rent in private under my name and establish an indemnity agreement with my Bv.  
Pro's: Seems pretty straightforward and simple to set up.  
I remain the sole responsible for the lease with the landlord.  
Con's: The indemnity is considered taxable income for me (as real estate income).

2- Sign a Single Lease Contract with an Addendum for Professional Use:  
Pro's: Clearly defined portion of the rent allocated to professional use.  
No extra taxable income for me as a private person.  
Con's: Requires explicit agreement from the landlord, and higher taxable income for them as partially rented to a business. 

My questions:  
For the ones in the same case scenario: How did you set it up and why?  
Could you also deduct partially Kitchen & Toilet? For e.g, clients come to head office, they want coffee and might want to use toilets. Then if you work 8 hours a day, 1/3 of the kitchen and toilets could be of professional use. Is my interpretation correct? 

FYI, I asked my accountant and will have a meeting with him next week. I'm simply curious and value the opinion of you guys here!

I am currently trying to build out a 3-statement model from an old information memorandum I got from a friend to practice on. As is usually the case for smaller companies, the financial statements provided are not extensive. 

Given that I only have a balance sheet and an income statement, I am currently trying to build out the cash flow statement from these two. However, my cash balances from my CFS do not even come close to matching what my balance sheet lists under ""Cash and Cash Equivalents"". 

I've been trying to get through this with youtube tutorials and some LLM guidance, but to no avail. Hence, I would really appreciate if one of you with a bit more experience can help me out. Should I expect my cash balances from my CFS to perfectly match the BS values in this specific case, and if so, where might I be going wrong? 

Here is what I have to work with:

[Income Statement](https://preview.redd.it/4o83n99lqbde1.jpg?width=483&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=972d661817eb31fa53ff69cadabf7367a75b360e)

[Net Cash - I personally have never seen something like this before, according to the slide title this shows cash and non-operating assets in excess of financial debt](https://preview.redd.it/ko0x44qnqbde1.jpg?width=481&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25d58de0778f578fb175eba8ef1236819372472c)

I would have expected to be able to pull together some data from my income statement along with changes in balance sheet items to get to a cash-flow statement. However, from my CFS calculations I get an ending cash balance for FY21 of $5,856 (vs $1,858 on the BS) and FY22 of $10,931 (vs $3,547 on the BS) which are way off the mark.

For context: I am a 21F and I met this guy 23M on an interview (as candidates, for different roles) 3 months ago. The first day when we met each other, I was lowkey interested in him already because he was my type. Me, 23M guy and another candidate we all exchanged our instagrams to keep in touch at the end of the interview. I messaged him first after the interview, and from then on we started messaging each other a little bit and I did want to get to know him a bit more. A few days later, I suggested that we could hang out together, 1 on 1 and he responded with he'll think about it over the exam period, which lead me thinking that I got rejected and decided to take a step back and I stopped being interested in him.

After the exam period, he asked when I was free to hang out but at that point I was disinterested and I was pretty busy with going overseas and stuff. Fast forward to New years eve, we started talking a bit more because he would message me here and there and send me random pictures from his day. He asked when I was free and we hung out the first week of this month. It was fun, we walked around the mall for a while, grabbed lunch together, watched a movie and had a long walk around the park. We spent around 6 hours together that day and at the end of the hangout he asked if I was willing to hang out again and I said yes. A week and a half later, we went to the mall and it was just endless talking and walking around the mall. We did have coffee and lunch in between those times and had to move our cars cos we were at the mall for too long lol. We kept walking and talking around the mall and towards the end, we sat down and he asked more relationship based questions. How many relationships I've been in, what are my standards when it comes to dating a guy etc etc. What we look for in terms of dating, pretty much align with each other. He's looking for serious long term relationship, a kind and caring girl etc etc. He said he wanted to ask me out (to be his gf) but he wasn't sure when was the right time to do so and we kept talking about something else. I told him later, I had a feeling he was going to say or ask something (me to be his gf) and I said if he was going to do so, today's not the right time. We were at the same mall for about 6\~7 hours that day and time just flew by.

Although, if he is going to ask I'm more so leaning towards saying yes. Why I'm being hesitant is because I feel like I don't know him well enough and we've only seen each other 3 times and the remainder of our conversations has been online through messages. First time was at the interview, second time was our first hang out and the third time was the most recent hang out. Also, I've been in a relationship once before and I dated my ex for a month and a half before I broke up with him. I broke up with him because I felt like I didn't like him as much and my feelings for him didn't develop. That's when I told myself that if I'm ever going to date again, I'll make sure to really really like the guy before starting a relationship. With this current guy, I feel like after hanging out with him, I am interested in him and he's ticked all my boxes and I feel like he really is what I'm looking for when I look for a potential partner. I think I'm just scared that I don't like him enough and I don't know him WELL enough... At this point in time, hypothetically, if he does ask me out next week should I say yes or no? Should I say no and just keep talking to him, hanging out with him more until I feel like it's time to step into a relationship or should I step into the relationship and learn more about him and see how things go from there ?

I love going through collection of movies, and watching everything from a director etc. 

I'm also looking for more people to play **games** with! Like **FortniteZB**, **apex**, **stardew**, **minecraft**, etc. This is not a complete list but i'm pretty much down for most games. Not really a **fan** of Rivals/OW though, nor mobas. 

I'm just gonna do a bullet list to list of some random things i like? I have a really hard time talking about myself, or the stuff i like so, let's gooo!

* Toast! Love toasted bread. I know it's bad for you, but so good
*  Coffee, duh
*  Horror in general!
*  Cats! I don't have one currently, but i've had them in the past
*  Nerdy shit!

That's about it i guess. I really want something with some substance, you know? And i don't mind chatting, but i would much rater just jump in a call and watch movies right away, haha.

I smoked on and off since I was 25, I'm now 37. was able to quit for years a long time ago but 2023 brought so much stress that I caved in. Want to go back to not needing this thing in my life and not having it control everything I do. Since I got up this morning I've made a list of the things that were easier/better without cigarettes:



-didn't have to do number 2 feeling like I'm in a sauna surrounded by white gross smoke



-breath didn't smell bad (I stopped last night before I brushed my teeth and went to bed)



-I made my coffee to take to the upper floor where my home office is, and I didn't have to juggle my mug and food and the cig pack and lighter. just one mug l, sammich on top, and a spoon.



-went to have lunch at one of those Korean bbq thing and I just ate and didn't have to make a fuss about finding a 711 to get cigarettes before we went to the place so I can smoke after stuffing myself with food.



-I'm sitting in front of my computer and I don't stink. 



I'm so done with spending so much and being so dependent on cigarettes. I feel like it's a toxic ex that you keep getting back with. I hope the tremors are normal (quit cold turkey last time and didn't experience this). either way I'm so done.",2,1737019792.0,stopsmoking,1,1.0,False

It's captain was blasting loud country music. Specifically one song from nearly a millennia ago; “A bar song” by Shaboozey. It was his favourite song. As the music played, the drab-green ship suddenly punched through the thick layer of clouds revealing an alien world full of crimson light. As the pilot descended, he whistled in amazement. “Pyro IV, always a sight for sore eyes.” The pilot chuckled in admiration. The engines kicked up rich maroon dust as the Freelancer MIS landed unceremoniously on the cracked red earth. 

The engines powered down with a high pitch whine. The airlock seal of the loading ramp cracked open with a “Psst” sound and then the ramp started lowering. As the crimson light entered the cargo bay the pilot stood proudly, the venerable captain of the Shaboozey, ready for adventure! He stretched out his arms in his white latex ‘Beacon’ under-suit and then with a depressed ‘sigh’, got straight to work. 10 boxes later in his beloved Shaboozey he was finished and ready for a snoozey. He closed up the ship because he was no fool, it was dangerous out here, and went for a nap in his warm and comfy bed. 

When he woke there was gunfire. Shocked, he ran to the cockpit and gazed out the windows, it was madness, there were bodies everywhere! More gunfire. The bodies looked like outpost guard bodies, and some were naked? What the hell? The pilot suddenly felt a presence behind him. He slowly turned, to see a dark figure in the hallway. 

“How did you get in?..” the Pilot quietly stammered.

“The door” the figure replied, “it was open.” 

The pilot knew it was not open because he closed it. But this fellow was obviously dangerous, possibly unhinged, he didn't want to argue with him.

“Can I get you anything? A coffee?” the pilot indicated towards the coffee machine beside the intruder.

“No thanks, I'm good.”

“Oh okay.” the pilot chewed his lip and nervously tapped his feet, trying to say something else that could break the awkward silence. Unfortunately there was nothing good popping into his head, and the silence was getting rather more awkward. 

“So what brings you here?” the pilot finally blurted.

“Cargo, money. The usual” the figure responded, not moving an inch.

“Ah” the pilot pretended to nod along, trying to make the conversation somewhat normal. “Makes sense.” - It didn't make sense.

“Do you come here often?”

“No”

“What do you want then, sir?” the pilot did not know why he called the stranger ‘sir’.

The stranger walked slowly and menacingly towards the pilot. The pilots heart leaped and he swallowed nervously trying to hide his panic. This was it! The end! Oh Lordie help him. He was too young, why now? why him?! Why at the hands of this mad man! 

The mad man stood over the shaking pilot. He lent over the pilot. And with a dark gravel-like tone said:

“I want..”

“Yes?” the pilot was shaking uncontrollably now, his eyes now closed, face turned away and scrunched up, expecting the death blow to land any second.

“A..”

“YES?” the pilot squeaked.

“A ride. Please.”

The stranger promptly sat down in the closest chair, which happened to be right behind the pilot. Dumbfounded that he wasn't dead, yet, the pilot took a second to recover himself.

“Sure..” he stuttered. “Where to?”

“Security Post Kareah”

The pilot gulped. That was no short trip and a dangerous one. He wished he had never asked.

“But the.. the wormhole.. I don't have enough fuel!”

“Just take me.”

Now officially ordered, the pilot turned around and snapped into his pilot chair. Forgetting how to pilot for a second he just sat there. The stranger started to tap his fingers impatiently. Suddenly getting the memo, the pilot awoke back to the reality he’d rather not be in. Trying to break the uncomfortable tension, he said in a pleasant voice: 

“Do you like country music?” 

The stranger didn't make a sound, but the tapping became louder and more incessant. The pilot slowly lent over and turned the volume knob up. The faint sound of “A bar song” by Shaboozey gradually got louder, and sat at a pleasant volume as the pilot and the stranger gently rose out of the atmosphere of Pyro IV. 

The strangers fingers started to tap happily to the tune. ",2,1737019689.0,starcitizen,1,1.0,False

My 2 treating psychiatrists (I am their patient as an outpatient and inpatient) think I experience psychosis, though one thinks it is more ongoing and the other thinks it is just during mood episodes.

That said, when I get admitted to the hospital you always have to go through the Emergency Department.  I have like 5 different psychiatric consultation reports from the hospital saying that I was for sure not exhibiting any signs of psychosis when I was admitted.

My psychiatrists are like, ""You believed you were a creature from a multi-dimensional universe and you describe a very chaotic mental state with brief hallucinations.  That's psychosis.""

BUT if it is a delusion, I wouldn't be able to hide it, right?  And if I had thought disorganization it would be apparent, correct?  And the papers specifically said there was no sign of me listening to voices or looking off in other directions (I mean, they said it in fancy language but that was the gist of it) and that is because the things I see and hear are so typical and routine that I am fairly good and ignoring them.  They aren't like in A Beautiful Mind where they are actual people that stand there and don't go away.  They might be actual people, but they are only there for a second.  Or they might be like a llama head, but then it is gone almost as quick as it was there.  They are like fruit flies, not hallucinations.  And the voices are like background chatter most of the time.  It would be like conversation in the background in a coffee shop.  Not hallucinations like where the voices are like talking to me, like in psychosis.  

I'm not anti-medication by any means.  I am all for medication.  I just don't want to take medication for a mental state that is still well-within the spectrum of normal.  And my understanding of psychosis is that it isn't possible to mask it for extended periods of time, nor in front of clinicians like psychiatrists who are purposely looking for it.  

So is it possible?  Have you ever had a patient you were sure experienced ongoing psychotic symptoms but it wasn't obvious to most people?  That could like work and get an education and have a family?  Or is that the opposite of what psychosis really is?",1,1737019378.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

(Inspired By the ""Exhausting"" Thread)","I used to think a percolator was how you were supposed make coffee when camping. That's how my parents did it, and so that's what I learned. Then one time when we were camped out I brewed up a pot, and as I was sipping on a cup it kind of just hit me that when you boil the snot out of coffee, which is basically what you're doing when you perk it, you pretty much kill most of the flavor and what's left is bitter and unpleasant. That was the last camp out I used a percolator, and those were in the days when we still tent camped.

Nowadays I have a double-wall french press pot and to me that's the pinnacle of camping coffee. Even though there's a stove in the trailer I often find myself outside in the morning stoking a fire out of last night's coals and boiling the water on my trusty old Coleman stove. Even *instant* coffee is better that the percolated dreck I used to drink. I must already be getting spring fever, because I've been daydreaming about campfires a lot lately.

For context: I am a 21F and I met this guy 23M on an interview (as candidates, for different roles) 3 months ago. The first day when we met each other, I was lowkey interested in him already because he was my type. Me, 23M guy and another candidate we all exchanged our instagrams to keep in touch at the end of the interview. I messaged him first after the interview, and from then on we started messaging each other a little bit and I did want to get to know him a bit more. A few days later, I suggested that we could hang out together, 1 on 1 and he responded with he'll think about it over the exam period, which lead me thinking that I got rejected and decided to take a step back and I stopped being interested in him. 



After the exam period, he asked when I was free to hang out but at that point I was disinterested and I was pretty busy with going overseas and stuff. Fast forward to New years eve, we started talking a bit more because he would message me here and there and send me random pictures from his day. He asked when I was free and we hung out the first week of this month. It was fun, we walked around the mall for a while, grabbed lunch together, watched a movie and had a long walk around the park. We spent around 6 hours together that day and at the end of the hangout he asked if I was willing to hang out again and I said yes. A week and a half later, we went to the mall and it was just endless talking and walking around the mall. We did have coffee and lunch in between those times and had to move our cars cos we were at the mall for too long lol. We kept walking and talking around the mall and towards the end, we sat down and he asked more relationship based questions. How many relationships I've been in, what are my standards when it comes to dating a guy etc etc. What we look for in terms of dating, pretty much align with each other. He's looking for serious long term relationship, a kind and caring girl etc etc. He said he wanted to ask me out (to be his gf) but he wasn't sure when was the right time to do so and we kept talking about something else. I told him later, I had a feeling he was going to say or ask something (me to be his gf) and I said if he was going to do so, today's not the right time. We were at the same mall for about 6\~7 hours that day and time just flew by. 

  
We've planned another day to see each other and that's next week. I have a feeling that he might ask me to be his girlfriend next week. I'm not sure if I should said yes?

Epi-epilogue
---

The sun was rising over Ludlow, painting the sky in streaks of pale orange and gray. Louis Creed sat at the kitchen table, his hands trembling as they gripped a cold cup of coffee. He hadn’t slept. He didn’t dare. The creak of the floorboards upstairs told him that Rachael was awake--or whatever she had become.

She had returned the night before, her hair matted with dirt, her clothes torn and reeking of earth. Louis had waited by the door, his heart pounding, clutching at hope. When she stepped inside, she had smiled at him--a slow, deliberate smile that didn’t reach her eyes. Her voice, when she spoke his name, was familiar but hollow, as if it were being pulled from some dark, distant place. He hadn’t asked where she had been. He didn’t want to know.

Now, the kitchen felt colder than it should have. Rachael’s presence filled the house with an unnatural stillness. Louis stared at the staircase, dreading her descent. He told himself she was fine. He told himself she just needed time. But he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. The way she moved--too slow, too deliberate. The way her eyes lingered on him, unblinking. The way her smile twisted, as if she knew a terrible secret.

A knock on the door shattered the silence. Louis flinched, nearly spilling his coffee. He hesitated, then stood and walked to the door. On the other side stood Jud’s old friend, Deputy Norris.

""Morning, Louis,"" Norris said, his gaze sharp. ""Haven’t seen you around. Wanted to check in after… everything.""

Louis forced a tight smile. ""Everything’s fine,"" he said, his voice flat.

Norris tilted his head, looking past Louis into the dimly lit house. ""Ellie called me last night. Said she had a bad dream about you and Rachael.""

Louis’s breath caught. Ellie’s voice echoed in his mind, her desperate pleas over the phone before he hung up. ""Don’t do it, Daddy. Please don’t do it.""

""She worries too much,"" Louis said, stepping into the doorway to block Norris’s view.

Before Norris could respond, a sound came from behind Louis—a soft, guttural laugh. He turned sharply to see Rachael standing at the bottom of the stairs, her eyes fixed on Norris.

""Hello there,"" she said, her voice syrupy and wrong.

Norris’s hand hovered near his gun. ""Rachael?""

""That’s me,"" she said, taking a step forward. The light from the window caught her face, highlighting the ashen pallor of her skin, the faint smell of decay.

Louis felt his stomach turn. He stepped in front of her, shielding her from Norris’s scrutiny. ""She’s been… sick,"" he said quickly. ""It’s why we’ve been keeping to ourselves.""

Norris narrowed his eyes. ""Sick, huh?""

Behind him, Rachael’s smile widened. ""Oh, I’m feeling much better now,"" she said, her voice dripping with mockery.

The room seemed to darken. Louis’s mind raced. He could feel the weight of her presence, could sense the unnatural hunger behind her gaze. He wanted to believe she was fine, that he hadn’t made a terrible mistake. But deep down, he knew.

Rachael wasn’t back. Not really.

And as Norris’s expression turned from suspicion to horror, Louis realized that it wasn’t just him anymore. Norris knew.",2,1737018818.0,stephenking,1,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moving into a new home is an exciting adventure. One of the first things you’ll want to consider is the kitchen. Essential home kitchen appliances can make your cooking experience easier and more enjoyable. Whether you’re an amateur cook or a seasoned chef, having the right tools can transform your kitchen into a culinary haven. Below are some must-have kitchen appliances for new homeowners.

### Key Kitchen Appliances to Consider

When stocking your new kitchen, it’s essential to choose appliances that combine functionality and style. Here’s a list of appliances every new homeowner should consider:

- **Refrigerator:** A reliable refrigerator is crucial for food storage. Look for energy-efficient models with ample space and organized compartments.
- **Oven:** Whether you prefer gas or electric, having an oven is essential for baking and roasting. Consider your cooking preferences when making this choice.
- **Microwave:** A microwave can be a time-saver for reheating meals or making popcorn. Opt for one with various power settings and features.
- **Dishwasher:** Cleaning up after meals can be tiring. A dishwasher will save you time and effort, so you can enjoy more time with family or friends.
- **Blender:** For smoothies, soups, and sauces, a good blender is a must. Look for a model that’s easy to clean and can handle various textures.
- **Coffee Maker:** If you love your morning brew, a coffee maker is essential. Choose one that fits your style, whether it’s single-serve or a larger pot for entertaining.
- **Toaster:** Perfect for breakfast or snacks, a toaster can quickly toast bread and bagels. Some models even have settings for frozen items.

### Consider Your Cooking Style

Your cooking habits highly influence the appliances you choose. Some homeowners might love baking, while others prefer quick meals. Here are additional appliances to think about based on your cooking style:

- **Slow Cooker:** Ideal for busy days, a slow cooker allows you to prepare meals without constant monitoring. Just set it and forget it!
- **Electric Kettle:** Great for tea lovers or quick meal prep. An electric kettle can boil water in minutes.
- **Food Processor:** This appliance chops, slices, and grinds, saving you time during meal prep. It’s excellent for making sauces, dips, or chopping vegetables.
- **Stand Mixer:** If you enjoy baking, a stand mixer can mix, knead, and whip with ease. Choose one with various attachments for versatility.

### Energy Efficiency Matters

As a new homeowner, considering energy-efficient appliances is beneficial for your wallet and the environment. Look for appliances with the ENERGY STAR label. These models use less energy while still delivering excellent performance.

### Size and Space Considerations

Before purchasing appliances, measure your kitchen space to see what fits. Some homes may have limited kitchen space, so compact appliances may be necessary. Additionally, think about the flow of your kitchen. Place appliances near where you’ll use them for a more efficient workspace.

### Budgeting for Essential Appliances

Setting a budget is key when picking out kitchen appliances. While you may want the latest models, older versions often perform just as well and can save you money. Look for sales, especially during holiday weekends or back-to-school seasons. Compare prices online to ensure you get the best deal.

### Maintenance and Longevity

Once you’ve selected your appliances, maintaining them is essential for their longevity. Regular cleaning and following the manufacturer’s guidelines can keep your appliances running smoothly. Also, consider purchasing extended warranties for added peace of mind.

How to Choose the Right Kitchen Appliances for Your Lifestyle and Space
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right kitchen appliances is a crucial step in setting up your new home. These appliances can affect your cooking experience and overall kitchen functionality. To make the best choices for your lifestyle and space, consider the following factors.

### Assess Your Cooking Habits

Understanding how you cook is the first step in selecting the right appliances. Ask yourself:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-appliances-for-new-home  
  
- Do you cook frequently, or do you prefer quick meals?
- Are you an experimental cook, or do you stick to simple recipes?
- Do you entertain guests often?

If you love cooking elaborate meals, invest in high-quality items like a convection oven or a multifunctional food processor. For quick and easy meals, consider appliances that offer speedy cooking options, such as microwave ovens or air fryers.

### Evaluate Your Kitchen Space

Your kitchen's layout and size will significantly influence your appliance choices. Measure available spaces carefully to ensure everything fits comfortably. Here are some tips:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-appliances-for-new-home  
  
- **Counter Space:** If counter space is limited, look for compact appliances like countertop ovens or smaller blenders.
- **Storage:** For tools like mixers and processors that you may not use daily, check if you have cabinets to store them away.
- **Workflow:** Arrange your appliances in a way that enhances your cooking flow, keeping frequently used items within reach.

Smart planning can maximize your efficiency and enjoyment in the kitchen.

### Choose Versatile Appliances

Investing in versatile kitchen appliances can save both space and money. These appliances can perform multiple functions and cater to various cooking styles. Consider the following:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-appliances-for-new-home  
  
- **Multifunctional Cookers:** Devices like instant pots can pressure cook, slow cook, and steam, offering substantial flexibility.
- **Blender and Food Processor Combo:** Combining these two can help you make smoothies, soups, and finely chopped ingredients without needing separate devices.
- **Induction Cooktops:** These are not only energy-efficient but also allow for precision cooking.

Choosing versatile appliances can streamline your kitchen setup while keeping it efficient.

### Consider Energy Efficiency

Energy-efficient appliances can save you money and help the environment. Look for products that have the Energy Star designation. These appliances often consume less energy and maintain better performance. Here are some additional points to consider:

- **Environmental Impact:** Supporting energy-efficient options contributes to a sustainable future.

By choosing energy-efficient appliances, you benefit your wallet and the planet.

### Your Budget Matters

Before shopping, set a budget to help streamline your choices. With various price ranges available, it’s essential to find appliances that fit your financial situation. Here are a few tips:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-appliances-for-new-home

- **Sales and Discounts:** Keep an eye out for shopping events like Black Friday or holiday sales.

By being mindful of your budget, you can invest wisely in essential kitchen appliances.

### Read Reviews and Get Recommendations

Before making any purchases, do thorough research. Look for appliance reviews and ask friends or family for recommendations. Understanding others' experiences can help inform your decisions. Consider visiting local appliance shows or stores to see models in person. This can allow you to assess quality and user-friendliness firsthand.

1i2kuci,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i2kuci/im_stuck_in_a_brutalist_alternate_dimension/,"I'm stuck in a brutalist alternate dimension. Please, get me out. ","Whenever my upstairs neighbors are at their drunkest and making it impossible for me to focus on reading, I find myself spending the evening just staring out the window at the gas station across the street. I watch the cars come and go, bathed in the light of billboards and advertisements. Sometimes, I'd come up with little scenarios in my head about where they might be headed. I like to imagine that a few of them are drifters, just passing through—like my town is nothing but a quick pit stop for them and they'd be back on the open road before long. No responsibilities, no expectations, no concrete cages to suffocate you and keep participating in a system that you despise. Just you, the radio, and a sunset in your rearview. Freedom.

It began like any other shitty Monday. I woke up around 7 AM, sleepwalked through my usual morning routine, checked my social media and got ready for work. As I stepped out the door, however, something was immediately off. The hallway of my apartment complex looked different. The paint was peeling off the walls, and the floor was a mess—more than I was used to, anyway. It wasn’t just the occasional cigarette butt; it seriously looked like it hadn’t been swept in years, covered in a thick, powdery layer of dust. I was leaving literal bootprints behind as I made my way to the elevator. I opened the sliding door, only to discover a yawning pit, descending into darkness. It looked like the metal cables, or whatever the technical term for those is, had snapped, sending the elevator car plummeting down into the basement. Needless to say, it wasn’t like this the day before.

I turned to the stairs. They weren’t looking any better. Aside from the mess, the railing was barely hanging on by a thread, or a few rusty screws, in this case. Any weight on it would’ve probably sent it crashing all the way down to the lobby. The lights were out too—the only light came from the broken windows lining the outer wall. I remember putting my fist to my chest as pressure started to mount. More than anything, though, I was just confused. This place had the exact same layout as my complex, but at the same time, it looked like nobody had lived here for decades. I carefully made my way down to the ground floor, each step punctuated by the crunch of shattered glass. There were heaps of junk and construction debris all over the place. Had I slept through a terrorist attack or something? The building’s front door was hanging ajar, its lock broken, as if it had been kicked open from the inside. What awaited me beyond it was even more disconcerting.

Wherever I was, it definitely wasn’t home. I could say it looked abandoned, but that hardly captures how lifeless everything felt. It was like walking through a cemetery, with those familiar gray Soviet-style blocks towering over me like giant gravestones. They seemed a little too familiar, in fact, as I soon realized I was standing in the middle of an entire neighborhood made up of the exact same residential building—my building—copied and pasted over and over, separated by identical narrow streets. It was a maze of mind-numbing uniformity. Just trying to take it all in was causing my head to spin. The only semblance of normalcy was the morning sun breaking through the concrete canopy. But in this context, even it seemed off somehow—like I was an experiment and someone was shining a giant lightbulb down on me. A mix of emotions swirled inside me. There was the obvious fear, laced with a dash of morbid curiosity. Reaching the end of one street merely led to another, which itself branched off into two more. Everything looked so similar, and I didn’t want to wander too far, not sure if I’d be able to make my way back. I pulled my phone out of my pocket, only to find I had no signal, which I kind of expected. With nothing else to do, I decided to call out for help:

“Anyone out there!?” My voice reverberated off the brutalist structures, echoing through the empty city block.   
  
The silence, while it lasted, felt heavy, suffocating. I gave it another try:  
  
“Hello!? Anyone!?”  
  
After a few seconds, I finally got a response, but it wasn’t what I was hoping for. It came in the form of a sudden, loud and painful-sounding shriek. I just froze, one foot on the asphalt and the other on the uneven sidewalk. I slowly turned my head toward the source of the sound as it came again, this time even closer. Then, the figure of a naked young woman emerged from around a corner. I felt my throat contract as I got a good look at her.   
  
She was caked in filth from head to toe. There were random patches of her hair missing, as if forcibly pulled out, leaving only sparse strands clinging to her face. She was hunched over like some kind of ghoul, her crazed eyes darting around until they finally locked onto me. At that point, she let out another ear-piercing scream and charged straight for me, arms outstretched, grasping at the empty air between us. Adrenaline shot through my system. I turned on my heels and ran. The soles of my boots clacked against the pavement, closely tailed by the rapid patter of bare feet. I rushed back inside my building and yanked the heavy metal door shut, only to remember its broken lock. Luckily, my deranged pursuer didn’t seem to have the sense to pull on the handle; instead, she just crashed against the door and started banging away while I held it closed with all my strength. Eventually, the banging stopped and I heard muffled weeping, which grew progressively more distant until it faded away entirely. 

I anxiously loosened my grip and then, when no response came, hurried back upstairs. The barren hallways welcomed me back with indifference. I waded my way through the trash, knocking on each of my neighbors' doors as I passed. No one answered. I shouted in frustration, pleading for someone to help me or at least tell me what the fuck was happening. The panic in my chest was rising. I barged back into my apartment, only to be greeted by a sight that once more left me questioning my grasp on reality. Everything looked…normal. My dirty coffee mug was still in the sink, exactly as I had left it. Yesterday’s clothes were piled up in front of the washing machine, and the fridge was buzzing away in the background. I could even hear one of my neighbor’s dogs barking. Slowly, as if any sudden move could cause the illusion to shatter, I walked over to the nearest window, which showed the usual view of my street. People were going about their commutes, blissfully unaware of what I had just gone through. I looked down at my phone and, sure enough, I had both a signal and WIFI again. Unfortunately, my relief was short-lived.   
  
When I actually went to open the window, I wasn’t met by the expected cacophony of passersby or the waft of exhaust fumes. Rather, I was confronted by that same surreal, concrete hellscape that awaited me outside. The unvarying architecture stretched on indefinitely, dominating my entire view. Now on the verge of a mental breakdown, I firmly closed the window, and all of the familiar sights returned. It was as though the glass functioned as a one-way mirror into my former reality, giving me a front-row seat to watch as the world moved on without me.  
  
Of course, one of the first things I did was reach out for help. Once I finally convinced my brother that I wasn’t playing a prank on him, he got the spare keys from my landlord and came over to check on me, only to find an empty apartment. And I mean completely empty, like the day I first moved in, as if all my stuff had just vanished along with me. He even sent me photos of the exact spot where I was standing. It’s so bizarre to be occupying the same space as someone and not be able to see them there. It seems like this apartment is my only tether to the real world, the one you and I both share as I type this on my laptop, but that tether snaps whenever I step outside its four walls. In gamer terms, it’s kind of like my own little personal checkpoint.

Eventually, my brother had no choice but to start believing me, and to his credit, has been instrumental in me maintaining what little sanity I have left. That said, neither of us really know who to turn to. Who do you call in case of transdimensional displacement? The police? The government? They’d probably just lock him up in a padded cell if he tried to explain what was going on; maybe even accuse him of having a role to play in my disappearance. 

At first, I wasn't just sitting around waiting for a solution, either. Whenever the sun went down, I’d head out there and see how far I could explore. I waited until it was dark to make sure that the only other resident of this place, that crazy woman from earlier, didn’t catch me wandering the streets. I knew she was still lurking around because I could hear her crying somewhere in a distant alley, howling into the night like a lost dog. I honestly preferred it over the deafening silence. 

For a while, my excursions didn’t yield much. No matter how far I walked or which direction I took, it was all the same—the same forest of identical gray high-rises, surrounded by an equally identical network of roads and side paths that all felt like they looped back on themselves.  
  
Supply-wise, somehow I still have running water, but the leftover pizza in my fridge lasted me only about a week. That’s when I started to notice that I didn’t feel any more or less hungry than when I wake up each day. It’s like my body is stuck in some weird limbo; I don’t really need to eat or drink to stay alive here, which explains how the woman outside is still going, despite looking like she’d been stranded in this monotonous hell way longer than I have.  I wasn’t as relieved as you might think from that realization. From where I’m standing, it just confirms that we’re meant to stay here until we lose our minds, wherever “here” is.

And then, yesterday happened. I finally decided to just pick a direction and start walking, not stopping no matter what. If I lost my way back, so be it. As it turns out, there is an end to this maze, only it wasn’t the one I was hoping for. After maybe a good four hours of walking, the buildings and streets abruptly receded, giving way to a perfectly flat field of yellow grass stretching all the way to the horizon. No trees, no hills, nothing—just an endless plain that led nowhere. A literal ocean of grass. There was one single landmark that stood out: an old bus stop, like an island amidst the motionless grass. Seated on its bench was the naked woman, her narrow shoulders sagging, looking passively at her feet. With nothing left to lose, I crossed the threshold that marked the end of the cityscape. The grass was surprisingly rigid and firm to the touch. It actually took some effort to push it aside as I made my way through. There was no wind, not even the slightest breeze—only silence, as always. I plopped down next to the woman and glanced over at the electronic sign that shows how long you’ve got to wait for the next bus. With faint, barely visible characters, it displayed “998948798” minutes. The ridiculous number almost made me burst out laughing.

“You know, the longer you ignore it, the worse it gets.” the woman said with a voice that made my stomach churn. I honestly preferred it when she would just scream at me incoherently. She was right, though.  
  
“You the first one?” I asked, blankly staring at the ground. 

The woman let out a dry chuckle, which pretty much answered my question. There was no denying it anymore. I had hoped it was just some weird coincidence or that I was going crazy. But under all the grime and filth, she didn’t just look exactly like me; she *was* me.

“The last one begged me to kill her. I couldn’t bring myself to do it, so she did it herself—jumped right out her window.”

“And why haven’t you yet?” I asked, not really caring how callous I sounded. After all, I was basically talking to myself.   
  
She shrugged, and I nodded like her answer made complete sense. I looked back at the sign; at that giant number eroding away, yet barely making a difference. I thought about asking her what we were waiting for, but I already knew the answer—or really, the lack thereof. Not that it matters. Neither of us is going to stay sane long enough to see what’s at the end of it. Maybe some future version of me will, or maybe it’s just a glitchy timer that’ll reset once it reaches zero. I wouldn’t put it past this place. 

Please, whoever you are reading this, if you have any idea where I am and how to get out of here, contact me immediately. I’ll give you my brother’s phone number, my location, whatever you need; just please. I don’t want to die here.",4,1737017962.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

","Hi everyone! I wanted to share the story of my first ski trip in 2024 where I stayed at Le Coucou in Méribel, and how the most memorable part of the trip for me were the activities off the slopes!

In my first ever lesson for skiing, I surprised myself by staying upright and was excited to book more lessons. Except, thanks to a scheduling mix-up, that single session was all I'd get – and it was too dangerous to go solo.

But I was determined not to let this (rather large) hiccup ruin my time there! Instead, I discovered a world of possibilities for people who prefer not to take on the slopes. The activity that quickly became my favourite was snowshoeing – our guide took us on a trek through forests and meadows, where the only sounds were the crunch underfoot and the occasional birdsong, making it the most magical and serene experience. These winter hiking trails offered sweeping panoramas, perfect for photo stops - and I couldn't help but take many!

The most memorable moment of the trip was watching the sunrise over the mountains with a hot cup of coffee. 

And even though I can usually never sit still on a holiday, some of the best moments of my trip were the quiet moments. I got to try snow yoga (not as cold as it sounds) and spent my evenings enjoying a float and steam in the chalet's pool and sauna. 

Away from the mountains, Méribel has charming streets dotted with boutiques and cafes which are perfect for the après-ski vibe.

I wanted to share this story to give some insight to those who may like the look of a Chalet Girl lifestyle but are too scared for the real thing. I had such a good time exploring all the different things the slopes had to offer, and my experience was a surprise from start to finish but and unforgettable one nonetheless!

I've been the proud owner of a (very good, second-hand) Lelit Glenda PL41PLUS for a week now and am currently doubting my ability to extract a good espresso.

I have the following 2 points that I can't get to grips with and hope that someone can help me.



**1: The extraction goes through far too quickly**

I grind 18g (100%) Robusta beans very finely in the portafilter, use my WDT-Tool, then I use the leveller and then tamper with the ground coffee at a fairly high pressure.

Nevertheless, the shot (36g) runs through within 5-10 seconds. 

I use a GRAEF CM 800 grinder, where I've already set the grind so fine that it's just about to become too fine and block the grinder.



**2: Milk foam**

I fill my pot about halfway with cold milk. As soon as I start to froth, the milk gets too hot far too quickly and I get hot milk with a little foam rather than a nice, fine-pored mass.



I hope that someone here has perhaps had similar experiences and has possible solutions.",1,1737016981.0,Lelit,0,1.0,False

*Valentina sits on a plush velvet sofa in her dimly lit flat, a half-finished glass of wine forgotten on the coffee table. The Parisian night whispers secrets through the open window, but her thoughts are lost in the labyrinth of memories, a bittersweet ache echoing in her heart.*


Victor... even now, years later, the memory of you lingers, a phantom limb that aches with a mixture of longing and regret. I remember those nights, our bodies entwined in a dance of passion, your touch igniting a fire within me that I thought would burn forever.


You were a whirlwind, Victor, a force of nature that swept me off my feet. Your energy, your stamina, your insatiable desire... all those nights we’d spent making love whilst you explored every part of me. It was intoxicating, a symphony of pleasure that drowned out the whispers of doubt that lingered in the shadows.


But even in the midst of our passion, a barrier remained, an invisible wall that you refused to let me breach. Your secrets, your hidden depths, your true self... they remained elusive, locked away in a vault that I could never quite unlock.


I saw the darkness in you, Victor, the pain that masked itself in recklessness, the hurt that fueled your insatiable hunger for conquest. You had hurt others, deceived them with your charm and your carefully crafted lies. And a part of me, even then, knew that I was not immune to your destructive power.


Our ending was explosive, a clash of wills, a storm of emotions that left us both shattered. You told me we had no future, your words a sharp blade severing the fragile threads that bound us together. But your eyes, Victor, they told a different story. A story of regret, of longing, of a love that you were too afraid to claim. 


And then, years later, there you were, across the crowded room, your gaze fixed on me with a mixture of sadness and hope. It was as if everyone else faded away and I only saw you. The years had etched lines on your face, but your eyes still held that same spark, that same intensity that had once captivated me.


You said I surprised you, Victor. But it was I who was surprised, surprised by the vulnerability in your gaze, the regret that shadowed your once confident smile.


And when you confessed your remorse, your longing for a second chance, a flicker of hope ignited within me, a fragile ember that dared to dream of a future where love could conquer the shadows of the past.


*She takes a sip of her wine, the taste bittersweet, a reflection of the complex emotions that Victor stirs within her.*


Victor, you are a puzzle, a man of contradictions and hidden depths. And I find myself drawn to you once more, cautiously, hesitantly, yet with a yearning that I can't deny.


*Valentina looks at the text message Victor had sent her asking, ""Do you love me?""*


There’s a lot to be said, so I’ll keep quiet. If I say one, the other will be left unsaid....but, I do love you, Victor, did you hear me? Perhaps, this time, we can navigate the labyrinth of our pasts, confront the demons that haunt us, and build a love that is both passionate and enduring, a love that heals the wounds we carry and sets our spirits free.",2,1737016932.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

It's a cheaper bag too so I can only imagine what better quality jasmine tea would be like.

Around 6 months ago, I suddenly started getting really easy bruising out of nowhere. Bruises would appear without any cause, and if I bumped my leg on a coffee table, for example, it would create very big bruises, sometimes the size of my palm. At any one time, I typically have over 10 bruises on each leg.

None of my medications have been changed in over a year, and I have had no other symptoms. I had 3 blood tests over the months, the first showed low haemoglobin, but the second and third came back completely normal. They checked all my vitamin levels, iron levels, did a full coagulation panel, tested for Von Willebrand (one of my uncles has it) and that was negative. The easy bruising has not stopped but my GP isn't doing anything else about it.

I can't seem to add photos to the post so I will put them in the comments.

Both sad and relieved. ,"I work primarily as a home health aide/cna and was hired at this agency a few months back. Overall a kind company and recommended, I had an amazing manager and the team was very supportive and reassuring, as I do suffer from IBS. I would do my best to work with them (such as if I was having a bad flare up one day, I would offer myself to work an overnight shift or one of my days off in exchange) and it was mutually worked with. 

I had these particular clients that I would see two hours a day, at max four. The spouse of my primary client was mildly difficult to start with due to admitted paranoia from other agencies and families taking advantage of them over the years- she refused to sign papers at first, was very defensive and argumentive with my nurse manager, etc. 

We finally got into a routine and while I was still brand new, there would be hiccups that I would resolve promptly. Primary client was great- we laughed, we got the tasks from the careplan done and they really enjoyed one hobby we did together which was myself reading to her out loud a book of her choice and then we discussed it together. 

Spouse was....as I described. Each day that I came in, they would bring up how they ""wished I came later"" and then pull me into a 20 minute therapy session on how the client is doing terrible, continue to repeat tasks to me that I would assure that they would always get done and how much they ""hate their life"", along with other personal information I will not discuss. Each time, I would listen and I would respond that I will do everything I can/sometimes share experiences of my own as basic human connection. I am also just very friendly and too empathetic for my own good, a weakness of mine.

Throughout the weeks, the spouse would consistently praise me, always try to send me home with snacks and gush that they ""were so happy to have me here doing a good job"". They literally talked about having me be there Monday through Friday and were okay with me taking the holidays off. However, I also bore witness to them lashing out at their partner for certain things that they weren't doing, then proceed to scream, laugh and cry in their office- all in that order. If myself and primary client were talking too loud, they would slam the door shut to their office. If I went to offer to do something extra for them, they'd snap at me that ""they can do that their damn self"". 

They even would talk about how ""me having an agency charting app on my phone might mean my agency is listening to our conversation"". I was...concerned, and did bring this up to my one manager before she ended up leaving and her replacement was, while kind, very hard to get ahold of. 

So, Monday. It was a bad day. I was late to the visit, I had forgotten my uniform top, I had a few tasks slip my mind (thoroughly tidying up the bathroom, etc). I take full responsibility for that, my work was below average and I apologized to them for the off day. Primary client reassured me that things happen and that's not my norm. However, spouse responded: ""at least you DID something today for once."" She then proceeded to nitpick everything I did, would scream at primary client more than usual and even threw a fit about primary client saying that they drank their coffee out of the paper cup it came in, which I collaborated.

She proceeded to call both of us liars and ""stupid dumbasses to think she'd believe that"". I had to fish the paper cup out of the trash can to prove it to her. I couldn't care less what she said to me, but nobody EVER should speak to their romantic partner like this. Ever. 

We then get to the final day where I am called by my normally absent manager fairly early in the morning. She expressed that the client's spouse had ""various complaints"" about me, starting from that I was always tardy (I would literally arrive as requested and leave as requested), I would not complete any tasks and that I had become too ""personable"" with them. Now, this I can see, as I am a very friendly person who enjoys connecting with people. Definitely a trait I need to work on as that can be too much and healthy boundaries should be better established in a work environment.

They no longer wished to have me as their aide anymore, and because I was still on my 90 days, the team decided that the general trust was clearly not there and ""they would sadly have to break apart this agency relationship"". 

I'm generally fine, I already have three interviews waiting within two hours of termination and one agency already wants to start onboarding. I have overall great references from my past jobs that I left simply because I moved and positive remarks from past clients. The hours were just not working for me and I was considering leaving regardless. 

I am, however, worried for future caregivers and for my primary client, who is a genuine sweetheart and would remind me how much they appreciated me being there. I expressed these worries during my termination phone call and they were surprised to hear all of this, stating that my feelings were ""valid"" and they would look into this matter.

Is there anything I could do in the meantime, or should I just fully move on as it no longer my place, no longer my clients?

They discovered that my stomach lining is inflamed and my esophagus is sensitive due to acid reflux. I'm a 29-year-old woman and I'm not on any medication. The doctor advised me to lose weight and sent me on my way. I'm feeling extremely frustrated because I often wake up with severe cramping at night and sometimes during the day. My body is signaling that something is wrong, but I’m unsure of the cause or the solution.  I'm trying to avoid eating after 7 PM and am working on cleaning up my diet, which is already fairly healthy, by cutting out extra sugar.  I've never been a coffee drinker, and I don't consume alcohol or soda. Does anyone have any advice? I'm feeling upset and frustrated - my doctor didn't seem very interested in helping and was very clear  that ""we wouldn't find a solution” and that “30% of people have this problem”. I have a history of long-term constipation (as my only condition) - so I'm very cautious about my diet and regularly take magnesium citrate to manage it; otherwise, it leads to significant discomfort - so I know this is not the source of the issue as I have it under control. I really need some help. This began in the last year.

No, it happened very, very, *very* quietly. The humans were there, and after some time, they simply weren't.

The reason nobody noticed the extinction was, in a manner of speaking, because nobody who was left had a vested interest in noticing. By the time the last human keeled over, the Earth had long since been populated by supernatural creatures who were, frankly, doing an impeccable job of pretending to be human. So impeccable, in fact, that they were utterly convinced of their own humanity.

Vampires commuted to office jobs, where they groaned about taxes, deadlines, and the price of garlic bread (which, of course, none of them ate, but still). Werewolves held down respectable positions as librarians, careful to schedule their shifts around full moons. A handful of banshees became quite successful pop stars, their wails somehow always making the Top 40.

The point was, everyone was so good at being human that it never occurred to them that no one was *actually* human anymore. Every morning, they checked their smartphones, scrolled through the news, and tutted about the state of the world—just like humans always had.

It took precisely two hundred and thirteen years for someone—an unusually observant vampire named Greg—to realize that there had been no new human births in over two centuries. Babies, of course, were still being *produced*, but as it turned out, they were all small, slightly hairier werewolves. Or sometimes incredibly shrill banshees. But certainly not human.

Greg sat down with this revelation, sipped his ethically-sourced oat-blood latte, and thought, *Hmm, that’s odd.*

Being a vampire of the thoughtful sort, he decided to investigate further. After checking the birth records of the last several centuries (vampires are excellent with paperwork), Greg confirmed that the last verifiably human *human* had been born some time before the invention of the electric kettle.

So, two hundred years after the last human had vanished, Greg did what anyone in his position would do: He called a meeting.

“I think,” he announced to a room full of his supernatural peers, “that all the humans have been extinct for quite some time.”

The room went quiet, save for the distant hum of a werewolf, who was trying very hard not to eat his pen.

“Nonsense,” said a vampire accountant, adjusting his tie. “I had a perfectly normal human client last week. Complained about traffic. Very human thing to do.”

“Are you sure they weren’t a banshee?” Greg asked. “They can be terribly complainy.”

The vampire accountant thought for a moment, and then shrugged. “Could have been. What's the difference, really?”

And that, as it happened, was the crux of the matter. What *was* the difference? Humanity had, as far as anyone could tell, seamlessly transitioned into supernaturalhood without so much as a hiccup. Vampires still had mortgages. Werewolves still paid too much for coffee. Banshees still sent cryptic late-night texts.

In the end, Greg concluded, with the sort of mild disappointment that comes from realizing something you thought was important actually wasn’t, that humanity had gone extinct in a way that was so human, no one had bothered to make a fuss about it.",47,1737015336.0,HFY,5,1.0,False

1i2k8du,https://i.redd.it/eugns74odbde1.jpeg,Iced Americano with Velvet Crème,"*Cafe shop:* ZUS Coffee


*Beans:* BOSS


*Price:* ₱90


*Review:*

I like their Iced Velvet Crème Latte (the velvet crème specifically), but the dairy milk upsets my stomach ~~iykyk~~. I also somehow don't like the taste of soy milk or almond milk on coffee, and iced americano on its own is quite bitter for me. So, I add velvet crème to my iced americano order— and I LOVE it.


This is not new, tbh. I've seen somewhere that this has been ordered by other people pero may kasamang sauce or sinkers. It might also be available in other coffee shops, but this one is cheap and tasty. I noticed that when you mix the crème with the coffee, it tastes like a latte. But I think it tastes better kapag ininom mo siya na hindi hinahalo iyong crème. It starts off sweet and creamy, then the bitterness of the Americano comes after.


Velvet crème still has dairy, but compared to its latte counterpart on their menu, it didn’t upset my stomach as much. I think this will be another favorite of mine from them so far.
