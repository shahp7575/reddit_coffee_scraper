Need magpropose ng thesis projects for arki school and I've been thinking something about the coconut industry in the Philippines. Mainly because I find it ironic na our country is one of the biggest exporter of coconut worldwide and yet, our coconut farmers is the poorest specially in rural areas in the agri sector. One of the reason is the lack of infrastructures for value-added products, and market access. I'm planning to propose something that's focused either on research and development or the agro-industry like post-processing and livelihood facilities.

So lately life has been shitty and stressful, mainly due to the new administration trying to ruin my career as a PhD student in pharmaceutical sciences. This is important later. 

At the start of the year, I was diagnosed with ADD and prescribed 10 mg adderall, which is not a high dose. It has done wonders for my focus in my school and lab work, but when I take it in conjunction with coffee I sometimes can‚Äôt sleep at night - mainly due to the feeling of my heart beating out of my chest. I know this is a bad choice but I love coffee so much and the local shop doesn‚Äôt sell decaf. 

Here‚Äôs where my concerns start to come in. Between the adderall, coffee, and stress, my appetite has been in the toilet. Like I could eat 1000 kcal per day while burning on avg 2200 and not feel hungry in the slightest. I have had fixations in the past on weight loss, I won‚Äôt lie. I was in an abusive relationship with a guy who wanted to keep me chubby so no one else would want me. So yea. When we broke up I lost a moderate amount of weight through exercise and calorie counting. Since then, Ive stopped with the calorie counting, and get a fair amount of exercise in. 

My concern is this - while I‚Äôm not hyper-fixated on food, calories, etc., I notice that I always get a thrill of happiness when I‚Äôm laying in bed realizing I probably have eaten at a deficit of 1,000 calories today. And I worry it‚Äôs contributing to my high heart rate, and inability to sleep most nights. But at the same time, I don‚Äôt really want to stop these habits as I think it will help me lose weight. Ive been avoiding stepping on the scale - I know if I do I will either be devastated, or even if I‚Äôm happy I will become fixated on bringing that number down. 

I am in therapy, mainly trying to recover from abuse and also deal with the stress, and am wondering if I should bring this up with my therapist? Or is it not a big enough problem so-to-speak. I don‚Äôt want to get locked in a rubber room either.

1j6dqtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1j6dqtn/i_lowered_my_cholesterol_in_one_month_without/,I lowered my cholesterol in one month without statins ‚Äì Here‚Äôs how,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone. I‚Äôve always had high cholesterol, likely due to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). I‚Äôm 30F, active, mostly vegetarian, eat lots of veggies, non-smoker, non-drinker, and have a BMI of 20, yet my cholesterol levels were concerning:

**Feb 5, 2025**

Total Cholesterol (TC): 317 mg/dL üò±

HDL: 93 mg/dL

LDL: 218 mg/dL üò±

Triglycerides (TG): 50 mg/dL


I was really scared, but what shocked me even more was that my doctor immediately prescribed 40 mg of atorvastatin without asking about my diet or giving me a chance to try lifestyle changes first. I sought a second opinion from a cardiologist, who recommended testing my Lipoprotein(a) [Lpa], as that would determine whether I actually needed medication. Luckily, my Lpa came back at 25.6 mg/dL (within the normal range).

I suffer from severe health anxiety, so having high cholesterol terrified me, but so did the idea of taking medication. That‚Äôs why I took such a drastic approach.

After one month of strict changes, here were my results:

**Mar 7, 2025:**

TC: 237 mg/dL (-25%)

HDL: 79 mg/dL (-15%)

LDL: 149 mg/dL (-32%)

TG: 54 mg/dL (+8%)


**What changes did I make?**

- I drastically reduced saturated fat. Even though I ate healthily, I was consuming a lot of 85% dark chocolate, cheese, and semi-skimmed yogurts. I could easily reach 30g of saturated fat per day without realizing it. I switched to fat-free cheese and completely cut out chocolate (painful, but necessary).

- I started taking soy lecithin (1,200 mg/day), which seems to help with fat metabolism.

- I swapped my moka pot for a drip coffee maker. I'm European, and I had no idea that moka pots don‚Äôt filter out diterpenes, which can increase cholesterol.

- I replaced chocolate with nuts and nut butters.

- I allowed very few exceptions. One day, I had sushi (just sashimi and maki, no fried rolls), and another day, I had a cheese-free pizza (ordering that in a restaurant was embarrassing, but I survived).


**Conclusion**

I know I still have work to do, and I‚Äôll keep being just as strict, but the change in just one month has been incredible and has reassured me a lot.

I‚Äôm not against statins ‚ÄîI know I may need them in the future‚Äî but I‚Äôd prefer to delay that moment as much as possible. It‚Äôs frustrating that many doctors prescribe them without even considering diet or lifestyle first. In my case, adjusting my diet lowered my LDL by 32% in just one month, which gives me hope that I can keep improving naturally for now.

If you have high cholesterol, I highly recommend reviewing your saturated fat intake. Sometimes, small changes (like switching your coffee brewing method) can make a big difference!

A few days ago I came on reddit cuz I wanted some advice about some really weird stuff my job was doing; not a lot of customer but enough money for cash bonuses, constant schedule changes that no one's informed about - especially at night, unaccounted for large deliveries, really odd stuff with my coworkers and a big thing that was bothering me were these medical symptoms -  ergot poisoning I believe at this point.

A lot of packages were being delivered unmarked, seemingly to the meeting space upstairs and I finally check whats in it and its these really wrapped bags of flour - unmarked, just a barcode, and if all the parcels like this are flour then we are getting massive amounts of flour and I ask my manager about it and brushed it off like she really didn't want to talk about - said ""drink less coffee"", but it's not about the coffee and instead the pastries I reckon; we sell them off for way cheap, I've eaten some, the symptoms - tingling in my hands, they shake real bad too, muscle pain and cramping and shit, dizziness, crippling insomnia, insane waves of deja vu and I know exactly what's gonna happen next, messed with my vision - can't see faces proper anymore, other shit.

My fiancee kept telling me I was probably getting worked up over nothing, but I had a shift yesterday and aside from the flour thing, I noticed its started affecting the customers; a women comes in pretty regular quite late and her hands were shaking so bad she spilled her whole customer, three different people in two days have been talking about some bad after taste, complaining about headaches.

For context, I had a good manager, until I didnt, and i had a great team, until I didnt, thanks management. I have loyal customers who BUCK stopped with them.

Currently they're headed up by Brian Niccol, former Chipotle CEO, and the company (at least according to the news) is in dire straits -- personally, I left before this man was appointed, BUT thanks to media and TikTok I've actually had an opinion of this man and his propensity for GASLIGHTING since 2021. Sir! The burritos DID IN FACT change size! Why else would EVERYDAY citizens feel the need to record portion sizes NATIONWIDE. Then homie changes companies... Anywho. 

The simple answer, your leadership is shit. (Your just the extension of a trend that has been trending)

It is nice to say you celebrate diversity and inclusion but when it clashes with effective management, often times the employees who you really want in the company are 'coached out' by those who are threatened by them. 

I'm not without my mistakes, sure, but my story is not just mine. I know the 'big wigs' of the company would scoff to see such a post, but thats the point. When your comfort is no longer secure, you must secure it, I get it. Middle management is hard, but never have I seen such cowardice and complacency on a day to day basis. No follow up, no questions, no wonder.

As a Californian, I'm fed up, I have predatory management in my backyard. They are preying upon the young, sons and daughters, who don't know any better. Their rights are often overshadowed or placated because of 'business needs.' 

To sum up, West Covina, I think we really do need an uplifting, communal coffee business that's also REASONABLY priced and that isn't predatory in nature to our young adults. ",2,1741424851.0,starbucks,0,0.75,False

Consumption of coffee has been consistently associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, it is unknown whether the use of additives may modify the association.

**Objectives**

This study aimed to analyze the association between coffee consumption and risk of T2D by considering the addition of sugar, artificial sweeteners, cream, or a nondairy coffee whitener.

**Methods**

We used 3 large prospective cohorts‚ÄîNurses‚Äô Health Study (NHS; 1986‚Äì2020), NHS II (1991‚Äì2020), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS 1991‚Äì2020). Self-reported coffee consumption, additive use, and T2D incidence were confirmed using validated questionnaires. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with multivariable adjustment.

**Results**

During 3,665,408 person-years of follow-up, we documented 13,281 incident T2D cases. After multivariable adjustment, each additional cup of coffee without any additive was associated with 10% lower risk of T2D (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.92) in the pooled analysis of the 3 cohorts. The inverse association did not change among participants who added cream. Among participants who added sugar to coffee (on average 1 teaspoon per cup), the association was significantly weakened (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.97; interaction term HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.27). A similar pattern was observed among those who used artificial sweeteners (HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.96; interaction term HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.28). The association between coffee consumption and T2D risk among those who used coffee whitener was also attenuated, although the interaction was not significant (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.00; interaction term HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.66, 2.06).

**Conclusions**

Adding sugar or artificial sweetener significantly attenuates the magnitude of the inverse association between higher coffee consumption and T2D risk, whereas the use of cream do not alter the inverse association.",1,1741423970.0,ScientificNutrition,0,1.0,False

The Severance chip was intended to be an alternative to ether. Cobel and the other children at the factory needed to huff ether before they could ‚Äúman the vat‚Äù/do intense labor for long periods of time. They needed something that would allow them to detach from themselves to get through something physically grueling. BUT the long term effects of being exposed to ether were not so great AKA her mom getting sick and dying, the sickly looking guy who is coughing while she brushes her teeth, Rose with a breathing tube in the coffee shop, etc. So, Harmony Cobel comes up with the idea for the Severance chip as an alternative for anesthesia that doesn‚Äôt have the same negative effects. Jame Eagan likes the idea, and they start experimenting to see how effective the chip is as an alternative to anesthesia in medical/dental situations. When doctors and dentists use anesthesia they literally call it ‚Äúputting you under.‚Äù You should never know what happened when you‚Äôre under, like when you‚Äôre getting surgery. Then seeing how well it worked, the idea for the chip kept growing and they began testing it against the four tempers, woe, dread, malice, frolic. They‚Äôre testing how well the chip holds the barriers of emotion. They‚Äôre testing this on Gemma obviously on the testing floor, but also on Mark. Maybe seeing if his innie will be able to feel his outie‚Äôs grief over the loss of Gemma. Maybe they manufactured the meeting and romance between Burt and Irving and then had Burt leave to test if innie Irving‚Äôs heartbreak would bleed through to his outie. Will oDylan‚Äôs work ethic bleed through to iDylan? And then could even be, would iHelly‚Äôs anger bleed through to Helena? Numbers could somehow transmit something that Lumon knows their outies are scared of and they‚Äôre trying to see if fears surpass the chip (or something like that). In the wellness sessions, Miss Casey saying all the facts about their outies could correlate to the numbers they‚Äôre refining. The feelings about personal facts are all supposed to be ‚Äúequal,‚Äù if you look at a screen of numbers (in our world), your feeling about each number should be relatively equal. But as we can see, the refiners have real reactions to the scary numbers. The numbers could be part of the code in the chip, so they‚Äôre seeing some sort of crack in their chip and then refining it to stop the feelings they get from the numbers from being able to get through the coding in the chip. So maybe now instead of the initial idea of using severance to replace ether, it‚Äôs turned into something that will not only allow you to not experience things you don‚Äôt want to, but also to not feel any particular way about these things when you‚Äôre in the severed state. Gemma could be the extreme test subject (which would explain Miss Casey), while all of the refiners are doing basically the same thing as her in a much less direct way. Maybe the files expire when Gemma completes them on the testing floor. Gemma and Mark are working on the same files, it‚Äôs just that Gemma is doing it on a microscopic scale (zoomed in, details) and Mark and the refiners are doing it on a macroscopic scale (zoomed out, broad, indirect).  Or it could also be that the numbers are parts of the code in Gemma‚Äôs chip. Every time she feels strongly in a room, it correlates to a number (or number sequence) in the chip‚Äôs code which then goes to MDR. They fix that part of the code, adjust her chip, then they send her back into the room to see where else they need to patch. Keeps going until she doesn‚Äôt feel strongly in any of the rooms. Essentially comatose but able to do whatever task is required of her (ties into themes of a monotonous, dreary 9-5 and forced child labor). 

I don‚Äôt know, this is all over the place. Curious what you all think. This is my first post so apologies if it makes no sense!

1) A Delongi from Aldi. My wife enjoys this one. She's not quite the coffee lover I am. I use the steamer on it when I want a flat white. She's strictly into flat white coffee.
The porta-filter has been modified to take an after-market basket that's larger and deeper than the pressure-baskets it's supplied with. I also use a puck-screen.

2) A Sette 270Wi grinder. I'd ordered a Belman Pot online because we used to live in a very remote part of Australia and power outages were frequent. A month later, that grinder arrived in the mail. I had a Hobbit moment ""Why shouldn't I keep it?"".

3) A Flair 58. Enough said there. I saw a Pareto once and loved it. At the time I couldn't afford one. But, I did stumble across the Flair 58 while researching and learning about making coffee. I haven't looked back.

4) Because I have a reasonably consistent grind and amount, the tampers I use have a set depth. 

5) A coffee kettle that brings the water to 85C.

I'm a fan of The Pareto Principle. That is, that I can theoretically attain 80% of the world's best coffee for 20% of the cost and effort.

Don't get me wrong. I love watching talented people doing their thing. And that extra 80% of cost and effort to get that last 20% is appreciated. 

I'm always up for tips and tricks to improve. 

I'm from Melbourne, Australia, but have spent quite a few years living in one of its coffee growing regions. The coffee from the Far North of Queensland is nutty and earthy. I grew fond of it. They have plenty of water, so pesticides and herbicides are needed less because the plants tend to be less stressed.

1j6d0an,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1j6d0an/my_journey_so_far_and_what_ive_learned/,My journey so far and what I've learned,"For those interested in stats, as of today I am a 43 year old male, 1.75m, 76.3 kg as of today. 
Which puts my BMI just at the edge or the normal range (at 29.9) as of today. 
Which also prompted this post, because I am happy with myself today. I achieved something I never thought would be possible.

And I plan to get down to a range of 70kg to 73kg.

Word of advice: 
This is what worked for me. It's not meant as a general advice. Everybody has to find their own way of dealing with overweight. What worked good for me might be a recipe for Desaster for others. And vice versa. 

So, when did I decide to do something about my weight? 

My smartscale goes back to June 22, a weight of 110kg, but that was a few weeks after I started losing weight already. My highest weight was properly close to 120kg, putting me well into grade-II Adipositas. 

I was fat since puberty, but really started to spiral after my mum died 2020. Guess I gained a good 20kg in those two and a half years. 

Still I was somewhat fit, I work in logistics and at that time I walked 20km a day at work. 

I drank at least 2 litres of coca cola a day, lots of fast food (like two royal with cheese, a chicken burger and a twenty piece chicken Mc nuggets for lunch after work). 

Anyway, around summer 22 I begun to feel dizyy at work. I blamed shift-work, the hot summer and the fact that I was renovating my apartment because my best friend was going to temporarily move in with me. 

My stool became black like tar.

I ignored it for a few days although I knew what it meant. My mother almost died years earlier from a broken stomach ulcer. I knew the symptoms. And ignored them. 

One night I had to pee, went to the toilet and woke up a few minutes later, wedged between toilet and bathtub, I soiled myself while being unconscious. 

For five minutes I looked at my fingers (they are really interesting when your brain doesn't work right anymore). It was peaceful, calm and I really thought about just doing nothing. A day or two and there would be peace and calm. 

I wasn't afraid, not the slightest. 

What brought me back was the thought that my best friend would land on the streets without me. She already cancelled her old renting contract, she is a migrant struggling at that moment, just got a new job... 

I had no family left, but she kinda became my new family after we went through a pot of shit together. 

After a few minutes my blood pressure stabilised, I cleaned myself, went to bed again and slept for a few hours. 

Had breakfast in the morning (yeah, stupid) packed some clothes and stuff and drove my car to my GP. 

Who immediately hooked me up to an infusion and called an ambulance because my vitals were shit. 

At the clinic I was at an life threatening blood loss, I spend the night at the icu and in the morning they decided I have to undergo surgery. 
I big stomach ulcer that was actively bleeding had to be fixed with seven clamps. They found two more that were already scarred. 

Quote of the doctor after I was conscious again:
""Do you enjoy drinking coke?"" 

""Not anymore I guess?"" 

""Not anymore. Your stomach looks like a battlefield."" 

After getting out I started to (half hearted) count calories, cook for myself (and my friend) and slowly lost weight. 

End of January 23 I weighted less than 90kg for the first time. I was happy. Told myself to talk about how to proceed with my GP once I hit 80.

Two weeks of vacation in Munich with my best friend and I was back at 95kg. Which was okay(-ish) for me. 

Managed to get down to 90kg again and kept it around that mark until June. My next vacation. Up to 95kg. Again. 

My friend moved out sooner than expected, there was some bad blood over it, but I managed to at least keep the 95kg. 

Stopped tracking my weight around September 23 because I wasn't able to go lower anyway. Natural setting point bullshit, you all know the little lies we tell ourselves. 

And after all I lost over 20kg, that's a lot more than most people manage. 

A year later I was over 100kg for the first time again. My friend was in a really bad place mentally, I visited her a lot, ate more Fastfood again because I lacked the time to cook. 

Something clicked after she felt better. I went to McDonald's and overate on purpose. One last time. Around 103kg I started tracking again. 

I read ""Overcoming fat logic"" by Nadja Hermann, which is a real eye-opener. 

I started to track and weight everything. Starting with a deficit of roughly 1000 kcal. Yes, I know it's quite big and against the prevelant opinion of this sub. 

But it helped me to see fast losses, kept my motivation up. 

I set my allowed calories below the TDEE of my target weight. Reasoning that this would allow me for some leeway when going out and get used to the amounts I will eat for the rest of my life. 

For me that worked great. 

I slowly adjusted my meals, experimenting on how I could cut some more calories while still feeling satiated. 

Also by running a somewhat bigger deficit I never hit a real plateau. Might be the deficit alone or sheer luck. But whenever I gained some weight I could always point out the reason (having breakfast with my bestie on Sundays sollowed by long walks and drinking a lot less than during my normal days, say hello to water retention). 

A quick look at my statistics says that I constantly lost weight every single week. 

After hitting a weight less than 90 kg I started light workouts, treadmill and rudder machine at home, some barbells. 
I ride my (e-)bycicle to and from work every day, that's 20km each day. 

After the long read let's get to the bread and butter about how I lost weight:

-I stopped consuming bread and butter, and as a german that's hard, we literally call dinner ""evening bread""

-I was never a person that is hungry in the mornings, my shift starts at 5am. So why stuff myself before work? My breakfast consists of black coffee, a boiled egg and a scoop of protein powder mixed with almond milk 

-When I get home after work I am hungry. No way to deny it. I prepare myself a mixed bag of salad and add a can of tuna or kidney beans, sometimes if I am really hungry I add another boiled egg. That fills me up and I take a nap.

-After my nap I drink another black coffee and get on the treadmill or the rowing machine

-Followed by my usual snack: Lean, low fat quark with some ""chunky flavour"", stirred with water until it's smooth. Add an apple. 

-Dinner is something warm, either a deep frozen microwave meal from Lidl (culine brand, all types weigh 400g and have around 500kcal) or I cook something myself. Potatoes are great, chicken, champignons, all kinds of vegetables. Sometimes konjak noodles. Tomatoes. 


Pros so far:
-Yes, I am more fit and agile. I managed to (barely) do a pull-up last week. For the first time in my life! 

-I really like how my, clothed, body starts to look. Yes there is still stomach left, but that will visually disappear too with the next kilos.

-People compliment me, praise me for my discipline, not gonna lie. That feels good. 

-Other people ask me for advice and hot wo lose weight themselves. See above. Feels good. 

-NSFW >! Yes. Not only can you finally see your junk again. It grows out of the fat somewhat. I went from more on the small side to slightly above the german average. It's an primitive motivation to keep the weight down, but in the end we are animals. !<

Cons:

-Exchanging your entire wardrobe isn't fun. It costs money and at least I was, sometimes still am, at a total loss of what size I am now. I dropped from a XXXL to a M or L. My brain just can't wrap itself around it. 

-People telling me that I shouldn't overdo it. That I have to be careful not to lose too much. Yeah sorry, that's not what's scaring me at the moment. Keeping my weight constant will be more of a challenge. I am not turning from a guy that loves eating and doesn't feel full easily to someone that starves himself to death without noticing. 

-Loose skin. It's ugly, I can fold the skin on my stomach into a butt. Or roll it into... A roll? It's wrinkly and looks disgusting and will get even more loose before I am done. Most of my fat was on my stomach. It's a, if not the biggest, downside to losing a high percentage of my body weight. I know that some can build back over the next years, I know that doing more sport will help fill it with muscle mass. And if not... Yeah, even as a male I am considering surgery depending on how my body will look in a few years.

This guide will explain why this ratio works well. Brewing the perfect cup of coffee involves more than just adding water to coffee grounds. The right amount of coffee can change how your drink tastes. For many, coffee is an essential part of the morning.

Knowing the correct scoops ensures you enjoy a rich and flavorful cup. Whether you use a drip coffee maker or a French press, the ratio of coffee to water is key. Let‚Äôs dive into why 8 scoops work for 8 cups and how you can tweak it to suit your taste.

# Coffee Measurement Basics

Making the perfect cup of coffee can be an art. One key factor is using the right amount of coffee for the number of cups you want. In this guide, we will cover the basics of coffee measurement to help you brew the ideal pot. Whether you are using a standard coffee maker or a French press, knowing how many scoops to use is essential.

# Importance Of Accurate Measurements

Getting the measurements right is crucial for several reasons. First, it impacts the flavor. Too much coffee can make it too strong and bitter. Too little can make it weak and watery. A perfect balance is what you need.

Here are a few reasons why accurate measurements matter:

* **Consistency**: When you measure accurately, you get the same taste every time. This is great if you have a favorite flavor profile.
* **Cost-effective**: Using the right amount of coffee ensures you don‚Äôt waste your coffee grounds.
* **Health benefits**: Too much caffeine can be harmful. Proper measurements help you control your intake.

Here‚Äôs a simple table to guide you:

|Number of Cups|Scoops of Coffee|
|:-|:-|
|1 cup|1 scoop|
|8 cups|8 scoops|

Using this table, you can easily scale the number of scoops you need based on how many cups you are making. Remember, the general rule is one scoop per cup.

# Common Coffee Scoop Sizes

Understanding scoop sizes is also important. Coffee scoops come in different sizes, and knowing which one you have can affect your measurements.

Common scoop sizes include:

* **Standard scoop**: About 2 tablespoons or 10 grams of coffee.
* **Smaller scoop**: Often 1 tablespoon or 5 grams.

Here‚Äôs a quick reference:

|Scoop Size|Approximate Volume|
|:-|:-|
|Standard scoop|2 tablespoons|
|Smaller scoop|1 tablespoon|

To find out which scoop you have, use a measuring spoon. Scoop out some coffee and see how many tablespoons it holds. This will help you adjust your measurements accordingly.

For example, if you have a smaller scoop, you‚Äôll need to use two scoops per cup instead of one. Knowing the size of your scoop ensures you use the right amount of coffee every time.

By understanding these basics and using accurate measurements, you can enjoy a perfect cup of coffee every day.

# Standard Coffee Ratios

Brewing the perfect cup of coffee is both an art and a science. One key aspect that influences the taste of your coffee is the ratio of coffee to water. Understanding the standard coffee ratios helps you make a consistent and delicious brew every time. Let‚Äôs explore how many scoops of coffee you need for 8 cups and the factors that affect these ratios.

# Coffee To Water Ratio

The standard coffee to water ratio is essential for brewing a great cup of coffee. The most common ratio is 1:16, meaning 1 part coffee to 16 parts water. For example, if you use 1 ounce (about 28 grams) of coffee, you should use 16 ounces (about 475 milliliters) of water.

For 8 cups of coffee, it‚Äôs helpful to understand the measurements. Typically, one cup of coffee is about 6 ounces (approximately 180 milliliters). Here‚Äôs a simple table to guide you:

|Cups of Coffee|Water (oz)|Water (ml)|Coffee (oz)|Coffee (grams)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|8|48|1440|3|85|

To make 8 cups of coffee, you need 48 ounces of water and 3 ounces (about 85 grams) of coffee. This ratio ensures a balanced flavor.

For easier measurement, many people use scoops. A standard coffee scoop holds about 2 tablespoons of coffee, which is roughly 10 grams. For 8 cups, you would need approximately 8.5 scoops of coffee. Using the right ratio helps you achieve a consistent and tasty brew.

# Factors Affecting Ratios

Several factors can affect the coffee to water ratio. Understanding these factors helps you adjust the ratio for your taste preferences.

* **Coffee Bean Type:**¬†Different beans have varying densities and flavors. For example, dark roasts are less dense than light roasts and may require a slightly different ratio.
* **Grind Size:**¬†The grind size affects extraction. A finer grind extracts more quickly, while a coarser grind takes longer. Adjust the ratio based on your grind size for the best flavor.
* **Brewing Method:**¬†Different methods, like drip, French press, or espresso, require different ratios. For example, an espresso uses a 1:2 ratio, much stronger than the standard 1:16 for drip coffee.
* **Water Quality:**¬†Water quality affects coffee taste. Use filtered water to ensure no off-flavors impact your brew.
* **Personal Preference:**¬†Adjust the ratio to your taste. If you prefer a stronger coffee, use more coffee or less water.

Experimenting with these factors helps you find the perfect balance for your ideal cup of coffee. Remember, the standard ratio is a guideline, not a rule. Adjust based on your beans, grind, method, water, and personal taste.

# Calculating Scoops For 8 Cups

Making the perfect pot of coffee requires the right balance between coffee and water. Understanding how many scoops of coffee are needed for 8 cups can make all the difference in taste. Let‚Äôs delve into calculating scoops for 8 cups to brew that ideal pot of coffee.

# Determining The Right Amount

Getting the right amount of coffee scoops is crucial for a flavorful brew. The standard measurement is one scoop of coffee per cup. But what is a scoop? A coffee scoop generally holds 2 tablespoons of ground coffee.

For 8 cups of coffee, you would need 8 scoops. This ensures a balanced and rich flavor. Here is a simple breakdown:

* 1 cup of coffee = 1 scoop (2 tablespoons)
* 2 cups of coffee = 2 scoops (4 tablespoons)
* 4 cups of coffee = 4 scoops (8 tablespoons)
* 8 cups of coffee = 8 scoops (16 tablespoons)

Using this method, the coffee to water ratio remains consistent. It helps you achieve a strong yet smooth coffee.

For those who prefer a milder taste, consider using slightly less coffee. For example, 7 scoops for 8 cups. Adjusting the number of scoops allows for customization based on personal taste preferences.

|Cups of Coffee|Scoops (2 tablespoons each)|
|:-|:-|
|1|1|
|2|2|
|4|4|
|8|8|

Experiment with the measurements to find your perfect brew strength. Keep in mind, the standard is a good starting point.

# Conversion From Cups To Ounces

Understanding the conversion from cups to ounces is important. It helps ensure accurate measurements. One cup of coffee generally equals 8 ounces of liquid. So, for 8 cups, you would have 64 ounces.

Here‚Äôs a quick reference table:

|Cups|Ounces|
|:-|:-|
|1|8|
|2|16|
|4|32|
|8|64|

Using ounces can help in achieving precision. Especially when using a kitchen scale. Measuring coffee by weight rather than volume can lead to more consistent results.

For example, 1 tablespoon of coffee weighs approximately 0.18 ounces. For 8 cups, you need 16 tablespoons or roughly 2.88 ounces of coffee.

Summary of conversions:

* 1 cup = 8 ounces
* 1 tablespoon of coffee = 0.18 ounces
* 8 tablespoons of coffee = 1.44 ounces
* 16 tablespoons of coffee = 2.88 ounces

Using these conversions ensures you have the perfect amount of coffee for 8 cups. It helps in maintaining the right balance and flavor each time you brew.

# Types Of Coffee Beans

When brewing coffee, the number of scoops per cup greatly influences the final taste. But did you know that the type of coffee bean you choose also plays a significant role? Understanding the different types of coffee beans can help you make an informed decision and brew the perfect cup every time. Let‚Äôs delve into the details.

# Differences In Strength

The strength of your coffee largely depends on the type of coffee bean used. There are four main types of coffee beans: Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa. Each type has unique characteristics that affect the strength and flavor of your coffee.

**Arabica:**¬†Arabica beans are the most popular and widely used coffee beans. They have a mild, smooth flavor with a hint of sweetness. Arabica beans contain less caffeine compared to other types, making them ideal for a lighter, less bitter coffee.

**Robusta:**¬†Robusta beans are known for their strong, bold flavor and higher caffeine content. They have a more bitter taste and produce a thicker crema, making them perfect for espresso and strong coffee lovers.

**Liberica:**¬†Liberica beans are less common and have a unique, woody flavor. They are known for their complex taste profile, which includes floral and fruity notes. The strength of Liberica coffee can vary, but it generally offers a robust flavor.

**Excelsa:**¬†Excelsa beans are often used to add depth to coffee blends. They have a tart, fruity flavor and a medium caffeine content. Excelsa beans provide a unique taste experience and can enhance the overall strength of a coffee blend.

I have a Dedica + K6 grinder, a spouted portafilter and a couple of baskets. double and single dose. both unpressurized

In the morning I grind +/- 30g of coffee with K6 aroun 30clicks setting, I dump 18g on my double basket and I get what I would say a pretty decent shot for my morning cappuccino.

The crema is thick and dark golden brown, I cannot steam milk properly still, but I enjjoy the drink

After a few minutes I take 9-10g of the remaining grind and I pour it on my single dose basket. The shot comes out much faster and the cream although there seems much thinner and ""pale"" the shot tastes with no body and not so pleasent.

So do you guys think it is the basket (grind, prep all the same) or does Dedica require a thicket puck (as te 18g) to pull a decent shot? Is anyone happy with their single shots?

as I take the capuccino I do not want to overdose on caffe√≠ne, but where I come from we used to drink only espressos (asking for a coffee on a bar gets you automatically an espresso)

1j6cltm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscifistories/comments/1j6cltm/i_believe_you/,I believe you,"A man collapses onto the cold floor of a dimly lit corridor, gasping for breath. Pain shoots through his ribs as he shifts his weight. His hands press against a wound in his side, his body trembling from the effort. The air smells of antiseptic and paper, sterile and detached, like a place that had never known urgency. He has arrived, but time is running thin.

From an open doorway nearby, voices drift toward him. Two men sit inside, drinking coffee. Their conversation is casual, mundane.

""He keeps asking for some science kit,"" one of them says with a sigh. ""Not into sports, nothing physical. Just sits there reading, always talking about planets and experiments...""

The other chuckles. ""Guess he takes after his mother.""

His chest tightens as he listens, but there‚Äôs no time to linger. He drags himself forward, his fingers clutching at the smooth, polished floor, until he reaches the large doors at the end of the hall. Summoning what little strength remained, he pushes them open and stumbles inside.

Silence weighs heavy in the room. At its center sits a man behind a stately desk, composed and impassive‚Äîthe President. His presence dominates the space, but he regards the man's entrance with an unsettling lack of surprise.

""Mr. President,"" he rasps, forcing himself to his knees. ""I don‚Äôt have much time. My name is Nathaniel Voss. I came here from the future, and you have to listen.""

The President leans back in his chair, his fingers interlaced, expression unreadable. A slow inhale, the slightest tilt of his head. Not a flicker of shock, not a single question.

""The planet‚Äîour world‚Äîit‚Äôs dying,"" he continues desperately. ""Climate disasters, resource depletion, mass extinctions. We lost everything. But we can still change it if we act now.""

Still, the President says nothing. He exhales slowly, then presses a button beneath his desk.

The doors behind the man open once more. Two large security guards enter, their movements swift and practiced. Before he could react, they seize his arms, hauling him to his feet. He struggles, his voice rising in panic.

""No! You have to believe me! Dad, no‚Äî""

A strip of duct tape silences him, muffling his final, desperate plea. His wild eyes dart toward the President, begging for a sliver of mercy. The guards pause as the President raises a hand.

Rising from his seat, the President adjusts his suit, stepping forward. He meets the man's gaze, his voice calm, almost gentle.

""I believe you.""

A beat. Then, with a nod, he signals for them to continue.

Nathaniel is dragged away, his muffled screams fading into the corridors beyond.

Later, the guards return to their office. One of them wipes his hands on a cloth, the other adjusts his uniform.

""Anyway, got Nat the kit. Been asking for it all year. He‚Äôll be thrilled.""

A silence lingers between them, the kind that neither of them acknowledges. He wipes a blood stain from his name tag, which now clearly reads.
