1mplxyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathBand/comments/1mplxyo/how_do_you_learn_to_like_death/,How do you learn to like Death?,"I understand if this is a heretic question, but it still stands. I'm very new to metal in general, i listen to like 4 bands, Metallica, Megadeth, Black Sabbath and Pantera. I've read up a lot about Death, watched some videos of Chuck live, and listened to a few songs off a few different albums. I plan to listen through entire albums once it clicks for me. Pantera took a few days since the voice was a bit hard to click and the vocal melody wasn't very easy to hear. now Pantera is one of my faves, so i know this is a learning experience, like coffee.

I don't think the saying ""If you don't like it it's not for you"" stands here. I don't think a single person here just liked death metal first time hearing it. I think Death has great instruments, and Chuck's voice is awesome, i just tend to think there's not much of a melody, the lyrics fit into the melody very awkwardly, and the pacing is weird.

Again, those aren't criticisms, I want to approach it as problems for me to solve. I already feel a huge drag towards them, like no other band really, I want to listen more and more, i don't know why. The big problem is I just don't like any song I've heard in the same way I like Five Magics by Megadeth or Disposable Heroes by Metallica, or heck, even Fucking Hostile by pantera, which almost has the same aggression as Death.",3,1755132153.0,DeathBand,6,0.71,False

1mplm0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/VestibularMigraines/comments/1mplm0y/feeling_exhausted_no_one_is_listening/,Feeling exhausted. No one is listening.,"I've had symptoms of ear fullness and tinnitus for 7 years. I've had off and on vertigo for that amount of time as well. Recently, I've had vertigo for about 6 weeks, almost every day. I've had MRIs, hearing tests, got a probable diagnosis of meniere's disease - but here's my question, if everyone in my family is diagnosed with migraines, why would I have meniere's disease and not vestibular migraine? When I say everyone, I mean everyone. Not just my immediate family but extended family as well.

I have all the classic migraine symptoms - I see spots, blurry vision, tunnel vision, sensitivity to sounds and smell. I even have a history of chronic pain on the left side of my neck and shoulder, which is where my ear problem is. I feel like I'm not being taken seriously because I don't get head pain very often. I have a history of headaches and migraines, but not that commonly. I have a history of grinding my teeth, but that has been dismissed. 

I've been to the ENT and today went to the neurologist. She told me that I can't have vestibular migraine without pain. I just read Heal Your Headache, where the author notes that many people are misdiagnosed with meniere's disease when they in fact have vestibular migraine. I understand that both can coexist. Maybe I have both. I am so frustrated because no one is helping me and I keep getting passed around.

I'm a very active person. I love running and going to the gym. I ride my bike all the time - even to work. Lately I can barely move. I can't get to work and I can't be at work without having an attack. I don't know what to do. I eat a very healthy diet and have started the migraine diet. I don't drink coffee or alcohol. I don't smoke. I regularly exercise and I am not overweight. I've been gluten-free for 6 years. I take meclizine when I get vertigo. I don't know what else I need to do?

1mpll2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeatherInInk/comments/1mpll2c/one_thousand_six_hundred_and_fiftyfifth_night/,One Thousand Six Hundred And Fifty-Fifth Night,"A busy day after so much relaxing. I got plenty done, though not as much as I planned, starting with the Sisyphus painting. I figured out what it was missing this morning; some lighting. While I was drinking my morning coffee, I painstakingly researched how to add lighting to a backlit painting. It was only so 'painstaking' because the internet has been difficult all day. Luckily, the actual painting process was relatively simple. A few shades of black and lines of white and I am happy enough with the painting to varnish it. The varnish, watercolour paper, and some others things arrived in the afternoon and once they did, I glazed over the painting. I even took a few pictures and posted them on reddit and Tumblr. Someone left a very kind comment on one of the posts.

Between all that, I finally returned to my writing. The introductions to the danaides are done. I wrote 840 words. I skipped over the ending of that scene and started the next; I'll have to go back to fill that in tomorrow. It was a bit of struggle to get back into it but sometimes that is just what starts are like. I am glad to not have to write anything more tonight.

I did also try to register another ISBN for an Ebook version of Midnight Whorrors. I looked up the book a few days ago and was pleased it see it available at several online stores which gave me the ridiculous idea to create an ebook for IngramSpark. I was not aware I needed a new ISBN for that. And of course, the fucking website or system or whatever-the-fuck isn't working. I sent an email asking them to at least give me a confirmation email. They emailed me back that they 'can't speed up the process' which is not what I was fucking asking for. I swear, the library and archive department of my countries government is pathetically run. I also tried to register ISBNs for I'm Still Sisyphus just to get a head start. I'm probably going to have to email them again in a month or so. Maybe I'll even give them a call. I am actually angry enough to voluntarily make a phone call. Ridiculous nonsense.

1mpld9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1mpld9r/before_our_first_child_arrives_i_wanted_to_share/,"Before our first child arrives, I wanted to share our love story","To the kind person who asked for true love stories, I have one. I want to put it down now, before the sleep deprived nights begin and my memory turns to fog, before the small person who is about to join us changes every rhythm we know. I want to remember what brought us here.

We met on Tinder. I wish I could say it happened in a bookstore, that our hands reached for the same novel and sparks flew. The truth is less cinematic and more modern. It was my thumb, his grin, and an algorithm. His opening line was a very bad joke about a stethoscope and how he was ready to listen. I rolled my eyes and wrote back anyway. If you are judging me, I understand. It was not the most romantic start. Somehow it was perfect for us.

At the time I was a medical student, wide eyed and exhausted, a mix of hope and fear wrapped in a white coat that was slightly too big. I had already lived through seasons that left marks on me. Some days I felt steady. Other days the ground moved. I carried all of that into school. Anatomy labs that smelled like disinfectant, lecture halls that hummed with tired fluorescent light, coffee that tasted like panic. I wanted so badly to help people and sometimes I could not even help myself.

He came into that life gently. Our first date was cheap pasta and a walk by the water with the wind turning our words to little clouds. He asked questions that did not feel like a test. He told me he laughs too loudly in quiet restaurants and that he keeps plants alive by talking to them. We took a photo in bad lighting, both of us smudged by the night. When I got home I stared at the screen longer than I meant to. I did not say it out loud, but I hoped the conversation would never end.

It did not. We fit each other into the odd corners of my days. Ten minute coffees between lectures. A voice message waiting when I left the hospital at midnight. A video of his dinner disaster where the pasta had fused into one rubbery sheet. He did not demand a version of me that smiled on cue. He gave me room to be exactly where I was.

The work did not get easier. Clinical rotations started, then residency. That first year taught me how to sit in a room and let silence speak. Some nights I came home hollowed out, full of other people‚Äôs pain. He would listen without rushing me. We would take the longest route home from the grocery store just so I could breathe in the dark and tell him about a patient whose story would not leave my head. He never asked me to forget. He helped me carry it. Second year of came next. I learned new languages, the grammar of reflexes and gait and tiny signs that changed everything. I learned patience at the bedside. I also learned how little sleep a person can live on. He would meet me outside the hospital with a hot drink that smelled like citrus and clove. He tucked notes into my bag. One just said, Look up. I lifted my head and the sky was doing its slow pink miracle over the parking lot. We stood there and watched like it was a rare comet.

There were harder things too. Twice in my life the lights dimmed more than I will describe here. Old battles, familiar shadows. I stepped away from the path I thought I would walk forever. I was afraid I had wasted years, afraid I had disappointed everyone who believed in me, afraid I had disappointed myself most of all. He did not turn away. He waited with me. He made ordinary days feel possible. He learned my quiet and I learned that quiet can be a kind of love.

I tried a different lane for a time, something in public health that used my brain but kept me far from the pulse and the warm mess of real wards. It was safer. It was also not me. The first time I returned to a pediatric department as a clinician, a child laughed while blowing bubbles in a triage chair, and something inside me landed. I remember texting him three words. I am home. He wrote back, I know.

Our life together is not a montage of perfect moments. It is dishes in the sink and grocery store lines and the soundtrack of a washing machine on a Sunday afternoon. It is three curious cats who think they own the place and one sweet dog who believes he is human. He claims the right side of the couch. I always forget where I left my keys. We argue about nothing and everything. We say sorry. We try again. He still laughs too loudly in quiet restaurants. I love that about him.

There are scenes I carry like postcards. The winter night I nearly quit, when the weight of training and the old ghosts made it hard to breathe. He came over without a plan. We cooked badly and ate on the floor. He held my hand while some forgettable show played in the background. No speeches. Just presence. The morning I passed an exam I had convinced myself I would fail, he left a note inside the kettle where he knew I would find it. Proud of you, it said. Boil water, then world. The day I got my first shift schedule in pediatrics and realized it was real, he bought cheap cupcakes and stuck a single candle in the middle and we sang terribly off key in the kitchen.

We traveled when we could afford it. Nothing fancy. Trains at odd hours, windows smeared with rain, snacks we bought from tiny stations because the vending machines ate our coins. We walked without maps and pretended we were locals when we found a cafe we liked enough to visit twice. We invented a ritual of saying one true thing before sleep. Sometimes it was small, like I liked how you said hello to the bus driver. Sometimes it was big, like I am scared and I do not know why. That ritual has carried us through more than I can name.

We got engaged in a way that suits us. No cameras. No crowd. We were sitting on the floor again, because apparently that is our place, surrounded by laundry we had not folded. I asked, Is this the life you want. He said, It already is. We laughed because it was both the worst and the best proposal line. Later we made it official in an office with clean walls and a clerk who had warm eyes. The paper felt heavier than it looked.

There is something I learned through all of this that I wish I had known sooner. Love rarely arrives to rescue you. It does something quieter and harder. It stands next to you while you rescue yourself. It gives you a place to rest. It hands you a cup of water. It says, I can hold the lamp while you find the path.

We are two men who have taken the many pieces of our lives and made a home out of them. The home is not perfect. It is ours. Soon there will be a crib in the corner and small socks in the laundry and a cry that splits the night. I imagine the two of us blinking at each other in the dark, stunned and tired and laughing, passing this new person between us like the most fragile treasure. I imagine telling our child one day about the silly app that introduced us, about the bad joke that opened a door, about the many ordinary choices that kept that door open.

If you are reading this because you wanted a sweet story, take this part with you. The turning point was not a grand gesture. It was a hundred small ones. It was him sitting in the car with the engine off while I cried after a shift. It was me learning to say what I needed without apology. It was shared noodles on a night when money was tight. It was walking the dog in the rain and finding out that we both like the way the world smells when everything is clean again. It was believing that the person beside you is not a project to fix, but a mystery to learn.

Soon I will hold our child and think, This is the start of another story. Before that happens, I want to honor the one that got us here. We met in a way that makes people roll their eyes. We stayed in a way that makes me believe in the quiet strength of ordinary love. If someone out there is scrolling through the noise tonight and needs to hear it, I hope this lands gently. Good love is real. It is not always loud. It is patient. It is sometimes very funny. It can begin with a bad Tinder joke and lead you all the way home.",1,1755130611.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

Context. I had a really rough night hard to sleep felt like he was feeding all night. Woke up this morning feeling and looking rough like a headache and perma frown. He looks at me twice and just ignored me this morning. I said ‚Äúaren‚Äôt you going to say good morning‚Äù because I felt like I was clearly struggling and he couldn‚Äôt even bother to acknowledge me let alone ask how the night was or whatever. I have asked before many times that I appreciate a check in in the mornings as I handle all the night feeds and as much as I‚Äôd love to night wean he hasn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs 14 months.

He then took a few of my items in the kitchen (box of iced coffee and some notebooks) and passive aggressively moved it into the living room while I was changing his poo diaper. I come out and see that there and open the door to his office and throw it on the ground. Here‚Äôs the text I sent him:

‚ÄúI was feeling really off this morning and just wanted some care and attention. Just a good morning. It‚Äôs not like I always want that. I get that I CAN SAY IT but today you saw me two times and just didn‚Äôt say anything at all when to me it‚Äôs obvious I look like shit. If you looked that I would 100% say are you ok to you. It felt like you just ignored me. And then to passive aggressively on the morning I TOLD u that I‚Äôm not feeling great move stuff from the kitchen into the living room??? When I had just cleaned the kitchen yesterday and I‚Äôm obv working on it.‚Äù

No response. I cleaned the kitchen and bathroom to be guest ready as I had a guest over yesterday. 

The day goes on. I was down the hallway and suddenly I hear cat kibble being dropped on the ground - I always leave the office door shut as that‚Äôs where the cats are. I told him ‚Äúyou left the office door open‚Äù. He said to me ‚Äúyou were watching him.‚Äù I said that‚Äôs not how it works the goal is to prevent accidents.. he doesn‚Äôt say sorry or anything. I said you know what normal ppl would say when someone reminds them of something? And he says no‚Ä¶ as in no he doesn‚Äôt know. I said f*ck you. Cuz I was pissed.

Yesterday we were leaving for a party and I said ‚Äúyou left the baby gate open‚Äù. The one in front of the stairs. He said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let him walk out without checking‚Äù. I said no babe we need to keep that gate closed every time. He got pissed at me.

So it‚Äôs like a few things in a row. I came out and said hey I need to get ready for this wedding event which he knew about and he gives me attitude and I just said what‚Äôs ur problem blah blah and he says you‚Äôve been yelling at me all day and you‚Äôre being a horrible parent for yelling in front of our child.

I‚Äôm in shock. Im not YELLING but yes I was irritated and agitated and confrontational but not shouting or screaming or anything like that, but yes tone was off.

TL;DR

Provide any advice for these classes if you can, study materials, or what got you through them.

Please don't include caffeine, hardcore drugs, or dropping out. I don't have the time to acquire coffee, I don't have any intent on doing drugs, and I'd rather end the game of life before dropping out of IB; I will persist.



I can probably survive precalc, given I study, although I've forgotten some critical things (domain, range, etc.).

Biology hasn't gotten deep, so not sure yet. Would like some advice.

Psych is solid, I like it, I can survive.

Forgot most of the Spanish I've ever known, took both online, not sure if I can hold up yet, but it's only Honors.

I don't know anything about IB/AP Eng Comp (AP coded for exam fees), so I'd like advice on that.

I think TOK seems fun and interesting so far, and I would like some more advice.

Cooked in Physics, not sure where to start, Proctor provided some information suggesting I watch an intro video to physics and go from there, in hopes I catch up.

I need ideas to make these rooms flow and look cohesive. I am terrible at this and my brain just feels stuck.

It could come back to haunt you one day!,"Last year, I went to a pride party to meet up with some friends of mine. I am someone who only goes partying once in a blue moon as I am introverted and can be overwhelmed by the stimulation. It was pretty crowded when I arrived and I had to sift through the space to look for my friends, as they had somehow navigated deep into the venue. 

While moving through the sea of people like a weed wacker, this random guy approaches me and strikes up a conversation. Normally I would politely decline to look for my friends, however this man was especially handsome (he looks a lot like Tommy from SMOSH), and with me being of the very chubby body type, I was not used to guys like this approaching me in public. So, I decided to see where things go. We talk for a few minutes, exchange info, and I move on to meet my friends. 

The night happens and after a week and some small talk over text later, I decide to see if we could go on a casual coffee date or something to get to know each other in person more. The plans are made, the day comes, and in true male fashion - I am ghosted as I try to confirm plans. 

At first I was upset and wondering what I could have possibly done to turn him away as we have only had a few casual conversations since meeting at the party. Moreover, he approached me first. Why go through the effort of doing that just to leave a person high and dry? My friends tell me to take it as his loss and I carry on with my life. 

Over a year has now passed and I have had plenty of dates as well as several dozen guys regularly hitting my DMs since. For some reason, it took until my late 20s to have my glow up and even though I'm still single and not any skinnier, I have never felt more attractive. To be honest, the experience from last year totally slipped my mind... until today...

Earlier, I went for my weekly trip to the pharmacy to pick up stuff I need. I have visited this place many times before but today I noticed a new staff person greeting people at the door. I think I saw him last week too, however it didn't register with me until I did a double take and realized... this was the ghoster. His hair was darker now but this was indeed him once I had a look at the name tag. 

My new found confidence seems to be changing me because something in my head told me that this was my chance to act petty in a subtle way. As he says hello to me, I notice his expression change as if to signal 'oh no.' I pretend not to notice him at first, do a sudden turn around, and ask: ""Hey, do I know you from somewhere?""

His eyes widen. He tries to play cool and mutters back an ""I'm not sure."" 

I proceed to ask him questions such as if he was from my home town or if he went to my high school just to keep the conversation going. A couple of his coworkers were nearby and take note of us chatting. They didn't approach but I can tell they were interested in the chisme. 

I almost decide to let this go as I was getting bored now but he then says to me: ""You do look familiar to me too, though."" I was in this for the long haul now. After some more prompting and his face turning white like a ghost, he then proceeds to say in an embarrassed tone: ""We probably met online or at a bar somewhere... Good afternoon...""

I then realize he was wearing a different color uniform from most of the others and it clocks to me that he might at least be in a supervisor role here. I start to notice his colleagues giggling from a distance so I decide to not take it further end things by replying, in my most customer service tone voice possible: ""Oh okay. Well have a nice day!"" 

I proceed to so my shopping and as I check out, he says ""thanks for shopping with us"" with an obviously forced smile and tone. I continue to walk past him without saying anything and head to a nearby burger joint to treat myself to a well deserved snack. I hope he learned his lesson about who he decides to ghost as the world is a much smaller place than you think. I may also need to start going to another store location.

For further context, as I am well aware of how this could lead to me looking like I outed him:

- He works at a very large chain that is known to go all out on the pride marketing every June.
- This occurred in a very LGBTQ+ friendly city in a neighborhood where a quarter of the houses have pride flags out front all summer. 
- I didn't point out his sexual orientation in any way, I just simply asked questions of if I knew him from various points of my life ranging from high school to past workplaces.",29,1755129158.0,pettyrevenge,5,0.7,False

In 2025, the market offers a wide array of options, catering to diverse tastes and needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The best mason mug jars in 2025 boast a combination of durability, design, and functionality. These features contribute to an enhanced drinking experience and long-lasting usability.

**Durable Glass Construction:** High-quality mason mug jars are crafted from thick, durable glass that can withstand daily use and temperature fluctuations. The glass is typically lead-free and BPA-free, ensuring safe consumption of beverages. Look for jars that are resistant to chipping and cracking, even with frequent handling and washing.

The quality of the glass significantly impacts the jar's longevity and safety. Premium mason mug jars use tempered glass, which is more resistant to thermal shock and impact. This ensures that the jar can safely hold hot or cold beverages without shattering.

**Ergonomic Handle Design:** A comfortable and secure grip is essential for any mug, and mason mug jars are no exception. The best designs feature ergonomic handles that are easy to hold, even when the jar is full. The handle should be securely attached to the jar to prevent accidental breakage.

Consider handles that are wide enough to accommodate multiple fingers for a more comfortable grip. Some mason mug jars offer handles with textured surfaces for enhanced grip, especially useful when handling cold or slippery beverages.

**Leak-Proof Lid Options:** While traditional mason jars are often used with standard lids, mason mug jars typically come with specialized lids designed for drinking. These lids often feature a silicone seal to prevent leaks and spills. Look for lids that are easy to open and close, while still providing a secure seal.

Some lids include features like a sliding closure or a flip-top design for convenient sipping on the go. Other options include lids with built-in straws or straw holes, allowing for easy enjoyment of smoothies and iced beverages.

**Wide Mouth Opening:** A wide mouth opening makes it easy to fill the mason mug jar with ice, fruit, or other ingredients. It also simplifies cleaning, allowing you to reach all corners of the jar with a sponge or brush.

The wide mouth design is particularly beneficial for those who enjoy making homemade beverages, such as infused water or cocktails. It allows for easy addition of ingredients and effortless stirring.

**Dishwasher Safe Components:** Convenience is key, and the best mason mug jars are designed for easy cleaning. Look for jars and lids that are dishwasher safe, saving you time and effort.

Check the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations. While most mason mug jars are dishwasher safe, some lids may require hand washing to preserve their sealing properties.

**Enhanced Drink Enjoyment:** The clear glass construction of mason mug jars allows you to fully appreciate the color and texture of your beverages. Whether it's a vibrant smoothie or a refreshing iced tea, the visual appeal enhances the overall drinking experience.

The wide mouth opening also allows for better aroma release, further enhancing the sensory experience. This is particularly beneficial for enjoying beverages like coffee or tea.

**Reduced Plastic Waste:** By using mason mug jars instead of disposable plastic cups, you can significantly reduce your environmental impact. These reusable jars are a sustainable alternative that helps minimize waste.

Many coffee shops and cafes offer discounts for customers who bring their own reusable mugs, making mason mug jars an eco-friendly and cost-effective choice.

**Versatile Usage:** Mason mug jars are incredibly versatile and can be used for a wide range of beverages, from hot coffee to cold smoothies. They can also be used for storing snacks, desserts, or even small office supplies.

Their versatility makes them a practical addition to any kitchen or office. They can be used for everything from meal prepping to organizing small items.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about mason mug jars can help consumers make informed purchasing decisions.

**Are mason mug jars safe for hot liquids?**
Yes, most high-quality mason mug jars are made from durable glass that can safely withstand hot liquids. However, it's important to check the manufacturer's instructions for specific temperature recommendations. Avoid sudden temperature changes, as this can cause the glass to crack.

**Can I use mason mug jars for canning?**
While mason jars are traditionally used for canning, mason mug jars may not be suitable for this purpose. The handles and specialized lids may not be designed to withstand the high temperatures and pressures involved in canning. It's best to use standard mason jars specifically designed for canning if you plan to preserve food.

**How do I clean mason mug jar lids?**
Most mason mug jar lids can be cleaned in the dishwasher. However, some lids with silicone seals may require hand washing to preserve their sealing properties. Use warm, soapy water and a soft brush to clean the lids thoroughly. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrub pads, as these can damage the lids.

**Are mason mug jars microwave safe?**
It depends on the specific mason mug jar. Some are microwave safe, while others are not. Always check the manufacturer's instructions before microwaving a mason mug jar. If the jar is microwave safe, be sure to remove the lid before heating.

Anyways, one day he called me up to spot him a quarter and we met in the park, blazed, and caught up on shit.

He told me about this digital coin that was going to be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars one day, and if I would let him, he would install some software on my computer and send me 25 of these crypto coins as a token for helping him out. 

I was leery of the idea at the time as I thought it could be some hacking scam and I vividly recall saying ""No thanks, I don't want any shit-coins.""

I remember he looked at me like I was missing a huge opportunity (or a few brain cells) and even asked me a few more times after that but my dumb ass still refused.

Fast forward to today, that shitcoin I wouldn't accept is now over $140k in my native currency.

I don't live with many regurts, however this comes very close to being one in my life - however I'm not missing any more opportunities.

A good friend tuned me into XRP and I got on board in 2021 through an Uphold account on Brave, I would earn BAT tokens for watching ads (no trackers/malware) and convert them to XRP in my wallet. In 2024 I decided to really buckle down and begin investing into XRP every week, skipping coffees and meals sometimes, and investing whatever extra $$ came my way.

I have a new goal of reaching 2500 XRP in the next year, and then diamond hands the shit out of that until it buys the farm - I've always yearned for land of my own outside of the city. 

That's my realistic goal that I know I will reach, and I'm putting it out into the Universe x

I'd like to say thanks to all y'all hodlers and amazing members of this forum, it's you who have kept me strong through the last couple years (long time lurker) and I made this Reddit account specifically to make this post and look at pictures of poutine. You never know who you're inspiring on the daily, and this community is truly supportive and educational for everyone involved.

With more global adoption and recognition, I believe in my heart that XRP will reach huge numbers one day and our wildest dreams will come true.

Trust me, I know that this was talked about in absolute excess when it came out. However, it's been a few months and mostly discussion around them has settled. I was recently reviewing over them for a project I'm working on, and I felt compelled to ask everyone three pretty simple questions.

1. Now that we've had time to think, which is your favorite? Least favorite? Why?

2. In particular, the second interaction had some controversy. Some stated that it felt like it was degrading Gency to a friendship rather than potential romance, and killed the ship. However, for us in particular, who first-hand witnessed the fallout of the ""drawing"" interaction previous to this, it seemed almost like an apology from the writers. Is that still your belief?

3. Genji drinking Angela's coffee was first established in a Storm Rising voiceline. In the same campaign, in what was probably the biggest appeal to Gency we've ever seen (excluding the survey wedding skins, and maybe Valentines lines), Angela asked Genji out on a date. Obviously it might be harder for that voiceline in particular to return, but do you think any of the other voicelines they shared in the campaign may be repurposed? E.g, more talk about how Genji and Angela enjoy talking to eachother: ""I am grateful for our conversations, Angela. I hope we may resume them when we return to base.""

'19),"First off, if you aren't using the AI Coach feature, you absolutely should. I've gotten great suggestions, not only about my general activities for the, but also the workouts themselves. I'll tell my coach what I want to work on, what I usually do, and what I want to accomplish, and I've gotten workout templates very consistent with the lifts/movements I like, while adding in some fresh ones that have been awesome (and curating the sets/reps in a way that makes total sense). And not only has it become part of my ""morning coffee"" routine every day, it's something I love to check in with throughout. ""Hey, how am I looking today? Any other recommendations?"" gets me a pat on the back and some realistic suggestions (and usually gives me a couple of options of things I could do, depending on how I'm feeling).

One thing I'd like to just quickly point out is that the ECG on the new Whoop MG sucks. It's impossible. I've probably attempted \~30 times and I've only gotten ONE successful reading. I've tried several positions for both my arms and fingers, I've tried using my middle finger to get better contact, and I've even shaved that part of my arm to ensure that NOTHING was getting in between my fingers and the strap. 

Whoop Age and the Pace of Aging in the Lifespan is really intriguing. Too small a sample size for me to give a real take, but it's got my attention.

I've posted this before and contacted Whoop directly, but one thing they should ABSOLUTELY be doing is building on the integration with the Apple Watch to leverage their display. If I were able to start/stop activities as well as start/stop sets in the Strength Trainer, that would be AMAZING. 

Before anyone says that I can do that with the Apple Watch since the integration will push it to Whoop, please see [my recent post on why activity detection on the Apple Watch BLOWS](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatchFitness/comments/1mpj9xs/this_is_why_i_hate_apple_fitness/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). It's a big reason why I re-upped with Whoop for another year when upgrading to the MG. 

There are certainly a number of small things from Whoop that have irked me over the years, and still do...but overall I think the updates with the Life plan are worth it if you lean into the features (and they might be enough to get you to do just that).",1,1755128338.0,whoop,1,0.67,False

One of the suggestions people had was to hire a consultant, which I had already suggested to the cafe owners many, many times as we've been designing over the last four weeks. They said, it's not happening - very confident never worked as baristas before.

The owners (husband and wife) were talking with an owner of another cafe this week who urgently recommended they meet with a local coffee shop consultant they know. The owners have now met with her, and she had so many good suggestions on every aspect of the cafe. They are going to retain her through opening for inventory setup and training - Yay!

This will be a combination coffee-donut shop and is going into a trendy and growing part of the city. The owners do have lots of restaurant and bakery experience, but as workers not owners.

https://preview.redd.it/licvtfq56vif1.jpg?width=1886&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b65d61cc394d45ebc501fb289e876819c5d69c72

Three of the consultant‚Äôs layout recommendations surprised me - both me and the owners have talked with many local baristas and cafe owners to get to the current plan. I'd love to hear about others' experiences to help us evaluate her recommendations.

**Where to put an undercounter dishwasher?**

One of coffee shops I've been to had a residential dishwasher in the front counter service area. Two had  undercounter commercial units. Two others had commercial dishwashers in a back food prep or bakery area. Several had none - small coffee shops, so washed dishes by hand (health department rules?). We were having a hard time deciding on the optimal spot for the dishwasher in our design, so I asked at every place I visited for opinions on the matter.

The universal opinion was out front with basin sink adjacent (several dishwashers were stuck in an odd location or away from sinks). And get a commercial undercounter unit with two stacked baskets.

I never thought to ask if there are negatives with noise, both from the dishwasher and clanging dishes when loading and unloading, and no one ever mentioned such issues. Several people did mention the convenience of dishwashing at slow times without having to leave the store front when working alone.

The Consultant said a dishwasher should *never* be out front - it's too messy and you'll have steam and water dripping everywhere. During busy times, loading and unloading will take up valuable space and inconvenience others. It's also very loud when running.

I'm a regular cafe/coffee shop goer, and at my favorite local shop, I have never noticed their (commercial) dishwasher running, and I have spent hundreds of hours lingering there. I have seen the owner or employees loading and unloading it during business hours, but its noise is just part of the background noise you expect at a cafe.

**Where to locate an ice maker?**

Another decision we went round and round on. We finally decided that the best quality models were too tall to go under standard counter heights (and have Health Dept. length legs) and needed extra depth, so it should go at the last place in the workflow. In our case, that would be below the pickup station.

The Consultant says it should be nearer to the point of sale (we are stuck with this L-shaped layout, so that's not changing at this point), and opposite the coffee station, so that when there's a customer crush, a second person can quickly step in with iced drinks and still be near the register (and donut displays).

**Undercounter open shelves or doors and drawers?**

The owners set a goal of having a very neat and well-ordered place - no cheap convenience store look with dirt and cobwebs in every open nook and cranny. The place should feel clean. The counters will have most everything needed out for easy access but otherwise uncluttered.

I always recommend full-extension drawers under counters when you know what kind of inventory you'll have. If everything is in large boxes and stays in large boxes until pulled for individual use, then shelves can make sense, but then you can always have larger drawers and pull the tops off of boxes for easy access. I have clients ask for drawers in standard base cabinets before I even make recommendations, with them believing drawers beat shelving hands down in most circumstances. Things get lost in deep shelves and it's just plain harder to see things when you have to bend down low and sort through layers.

We also have a fair amount of open shelving space in the back of the store - it seems you can never have enough storage space.

The Consultant says *no* drawers or doors and *shelves only* \- at peak times when everyone is rushing about, opening drawers (20"" extension into a 42"" aisle) and cabinet doors get in the way of other workers. No doors allow one to just reach down and grab. No fuss, no muss - I guess.

We were planning on very large drawers in about 2/3rds of the cabinets (we have a lot of cabinets -[ link to elevations if you are interested](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nEjWv4gNZqdiznxWUuF7j2hQl5B05hON?usp=sharing)), and several base units with doors with moveable shelves mostly for the donut boxes and the thinking is they'd stack the unfolded boxes on the counter above for quick grab for to go and large orders.

The other option is to have roll out shelves, but are those really better than drawers - guess it depends on whether you have doors in front?

The biggest problem in knowing what's best is that we cannot predict how long rush times will last. Should everything be designed for that peak time and an occasional need to get in a drawer?

One thing the majority of the baristas (not owners) I talked with said is that you just adjust to the workplace circumstances you are given. People expect to sometimes have to wait at rush times, and saving a couple of seconds here and there at those times is not their highest priority.

I‚Äôve experienced heartbreak before, but this experience has left me traumatized and after o long time i think i‚Äôve started to see why:

She was an amazing beautiful strong woman. I became limerent quite fast and started abandoning myself quite early. We dated for over half a year.

I am naturally anxious and there are some issues with self esteem. But most folk wouldnt be able to tell. I seem open and funny and put on sort of a strong front.

But this woman oozed of such confidence and control. I wouldn‚Äôt call it lovebombing, but she made me feel like i could do no wrong.
And while there was affection, there was like this ¬´wall¬ª. I was always kept at arms length and there was probably some intermittent reinforcement at play. So i started to abandon myself. Chasing the high of being truly seen and chosen by someone way out of my league.

She was so kind and understanding. I told her multiple times i was nervous and she just soothed me. In hindsight i probably devolved from being funny and open to this nervous blob. 
Very unattractive. But she still soothed and cared for me.

I confessed my strong feelings for her and she froze and there was a notable flip. She started to pull away. My anxiety spiraled and a breakup ensued.

She said she liked my company but didnt really see me romantically. That i was kind and caring and she dreaded hurting me, but didn‚Äôt really see me romantically. Not now. Maybe never.

And i fell into pit.
I pleaded and cried, but to no awail. 
Grief. Anger. Anxiety. Rumination.
I was completely broken.
The heartbreak went away after two weeks.
But the anxiety STILL lingers. Like i‚Äôve been exposed.
I‚Äôve noticed myself being extremely closed off to others as of late.
Like i‚Äôm scared to open up.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôve been to a therapist to discuss it and i think i‚Äôve started to see why i‚Äôve been so stuck:

- Because she drew out my darkest side:

The part of me who never felt good enough.
The real me.
The scared child inside me i‚Äôd hidden away.

But with her, i felt accepted and seen like i‚Äôve never felt before. Truly accepted. 

And then‚Ä¶ She took it away‚Ä¶.

And i‚Äôve never felt so abandoned and betrayed in my life.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


She has offered to catch up for coffee, becaue she cares and finds me great company, and the thought has been making me‚Ä¶ Anxious?

Who am i to show her? That i‚Äôve ¬´moved on¬ª?

Or do i let my guard down again? Be the open and honest person she knew‚Ä¶ But ultimately abandoned‚Ä¶

Like, there is this person out in the world that has seen me at my absolute lowest‚Ä¶ And chose to walk away. A person out there who actually saw me.

I might not show up. I dont‚Äôt want to face her. To face myself. 

To let someone see how vulnerable you truly are and then walk away. I know she is kind at heart, but there is resentement i can‚Äôt let go. Like i was betrayed at my CORE.

- In more calm moments i look forward to see her, hug her and wish her well.

- In other moments i want to take my power BACK and scream at her, angry:
¬´You tricked me! You led me on! I don‚Äôt need you! You‚Äôre not better than me! You didn‚Äôt see anything! That wasn‚Äôt me, you made me like that!¬ª

- But deep inside, the little boy inside just wants to crawl into her lap and plead for her to not leave me. To take me back. 


Should i have that coffee? 
Maybe.

Do i wan‚Äôt to?
I honestly don‚Äôt know.

I accepted friendship after the breakup, but i hadn‚Äôt really thought it through‚Ä¶ 
And part of me don‚Äôt feel like she deserves it. Not even a piece of me.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

My therapist did some digging into my past and concluded:

¬´You never felt safe growing up¬ª

¬´Your father made you feel like you weren‚Äôt accepted unless you performed the role he wanted you to be¬ª

¬´Inside you there is that scared little boy who wants comfort and safety. You don‚Äôt like him and you don‚Äôt treat him well. He needs comfort from YOU. Can you give it to him?¬ª



This experience put into words the things i‚Äôd always felt, but never ariculated:

¬´I‚Äôm scared that no one can truly love me¬ª


And i‚Äôm starting my healing journey now.

1mpkb3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1mpkb3x/im_seeing_strawberries_everywhere/,I'm Seeing Strawberries Everywhere,"It all started on what seemed like an ordinary Tuesday, a day where I was stuck in my apartment it seemed so perfectly unremarkable that it felt like any other.

And my main plan was?

To finally wrap up the last season of The X-Files, the show I had been eagerly binge-watching.

As I settled in, I noticed the sunlight dancing off my polished wooden table, creating a warm glow. Next to my laptop, I placed a generous bowl of glistening, ruby-red strawberries.

I had brought them along as a guilt-free snack, thinking they would be the perfect accompaniment to my binge-watching session.

I plopped down in my chair in the living room, fired up for the show, and without much thought, popped a strawberry into my mouth, leaning back with my eyes glued to the laptop screen.

But then came the moment of realization that struck a bit too late. As I bit down, expecting a burst of sweetness, I was instead confronted with an overwhelming sensation that eclipsed everything else.

Suddenly, the strawberry‚Äîperhaps just a piece of it‚Äîlodged itself perfectly in my windpipe.

One moment, I was breathing, and the next, an alarming void replaced the air that should have been flowing in.

My eyes widened in panic, and a scream was caught in my throat, building up but failing to escape.

I tried to cough it out, but the sound that emerged was just a pathetic, wet noise.

In a frenzy, my hands flew to my neck, clawing it and squeezing it in a desperate attempt to dislodge that stubborn piece of fruit.

A sudden chill coursed through me, constricting my senses while my vision was narrowing; my periphery faded into a hazy black void.

My lungs were screaming for air, and each frantic gasp ignited a fiery pain deep within.

I stood up, thrashing wildly, pushing the chair back across the floor in a desperate bid for relief.

I banged on my stomach, hoping that somehow it would help, and resumed clawing at my throat, but nothing was working.¬†

A frantic pulse throbbed inside my skull, taunting me in the suffocating silence.

My face oscillated between burning heat and an icy chill, a creeping numbness creeped in as my legs threatened to give way beneath me.¬†

This was it. To meet my end like this, choking on a strawberry, felt like the most absurd tragedy imaginable.

The ridiculousness of the situation only intensified the sheer terror that gripped me in that moment.

As the shadows began to creep in and I felt myself slipping into a state of panic, I heard the unmistakable sound of the apartment door creaking open.

To my surprise, my roommate Matt walked in, having returned home from work much earlier than expected, and his eyes widened in shock at the sight of me.

""Lucas!"" he shouted, rushing towards me.¬†

Without a moment's hesitation, Matt wrapped his arms around my waist, lifting me slightly as he began to deliver a series of forceful blows upward, trying to dislodge whatever was blocking my throat.

My body convulsed in response, but nothing changed, so he pressed on, each strike more intense than the last.

The world around me spun chaotically, threatening to pull me from underneath me as I fought to stay conscious.

Then, with a sickening lurch, I felt a wet cough escape me, and Matt instinctively released his grip.

In that moment, the remnants of the strawberry I had choking on tumbled out my mouth, landing in a gooey mess on the floor. At least it was no longer lodged in my throat.

Gasping for air, I produced a ragged sound, reminiscent of an old man nearing the end of his days, but the sweet, life-giving air filled my lungs, wrapping around me like a warm embrace.¬†

I collapsed to my knees, trembling uncontrollably, tears streaming down my cheeks as the reality of what had just happened settled in.¬†

Matt knelt beside me, gently patting my back, reassuring me that everything was alright now, that I was safe.

But all I could focus on was the sticky, red fruit lying on the floor, a stark reminder of my near brush with disaster.¬†

And just like that, strawberries transformed into my arch-nemesis, leaving me with an inexplicable fear of them that I couldn‚Äôt shake.

Right after the incident, I immediately rushed to the emergency room to ensure that I hadn‚Äôt injured my throat or caused any further damage to my body.

And after my check-up, the doctor returned with the results, reassuring me that I was completely fine and just needed to take my time while eating.

However, a few days later, my anxiety kicked in, and just the sight of the strawberries in the refrigerator made my stomach twist in knots.

Their smell‚Äîa cloyingly sweet aroma‚Äîtriggered a wave of nausea and a tightness in my throat that was hard to shake off.

Matt, my amazing roommate, took it upon himself to dispose of all the strawberries in our apartment, along with anything else that contained them.

He didn‚Äôt seem to mind at all; he just wanted me to feel happy and safe.

Strangely enough, for the entire week that followed, I avoided any red foods altogether, even if they weren‚Äôt strawberries.

Apples, cherries, and tomatoes all made me feel a surge of anxiety, even though they weren‚Äôt the offending fruit.

People were generally understanding, and a few even teased me gently about my newfound fruit phobia, but they had no idea what I had truly experienced.

I hadn‚Äôt shared with anyone that I had come dangerously close to being harmed by a strawberry.

As the days turned into weeks, my fear began to manifest in unexpected ways. At first, it was slow, but then it sped up quickly.

Strawberries seemed to pop up everywhere I turned. It started subtly; I was lounging in the apartment, watching TV when a commercial for a new yogurt brand flashed on screen, boasting that it was filled with real, rich strawberry flavor.

Then, while driving down the street, I spotted a billboard advertising a new dessert, featuring a giant, photoshopped strawberry.

I flinched, my heart racing as I gripped the steering wheel, completely overwhelmed by the sight of it.

‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôre just overthinking this. It‚Äôs all perfectly normal,‚Äù I reassured myself, but deep down, I knew this was anything but normal.

When Matt asked me to accompany him to the grocery store and handed me a list of items, I rolled my eyes as I grabbed a cart.

The first stop was the cereal aisle, and as I pushed the cart down the aisle, I was met with a barrage of cereal boxes, all bright pink and red, featuring a cartoon strawberry character, boasting real strawberries in every bite.

I hurriedly grabbed what I needed and darted to the jelly aisle, but once again, I was confronted by a sea of red.

Even when I attempted to grab some ice cream, all I could find was strawberry-flavored options.

When I reached the produce section, I practically sprinted through it, avoiding eye contact with the strawberries that were practically glowing in their display case.

The next time I showed up for work, a colleague brought in a cake to celebrate his promotion, and we all gathered in the break room to enjoy it.

The cake was a stunning vanilla sponge, dusted with powdered sugar and topped with artfully arranged slices of strawberries.¬†

As soon as I laid eyes on those strawberries, my stomach performed a backflip.

When I was offered a piece of cake, I politely declined, claiming I wasn‚Äôt hungry, even though I truly was.

My colleague happily accepted the slice, oblivious to my inner turmoil.

A couple of days after the incident at work, Matt and I were lounging in the apartment, engrossed in a football game, when I suddenly gasped in disbelief.

I thought I spotted a team‚Äôs red logo flash across the screen, and for a brief moment, it looked just like a heart-shaped strawberry.

‚ÄúAre you doing okay, Lucas?‚Äù Matt asked, concern on his face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, just‚Ä¶ tired,‚Äù I replied, my voice perhaps a bit too high-pitched to be convincing.

But soon, the sightings of strawberries began to escalate throughout the city, and it wasn‚Äôt just the fruit anymore; they seemed to be everywhere.¬†

While strolling through the park, I spotted a little girl in a pink dress adorned with a cartoon strawberry character.

Then, as Matt and I rode the bus to work, I noticed an older woman sporting a scarf patterned with strawberries. It felt like they were popping up around every corner.

Later, while shopping for a birthday gift, I stumbled upon a pair of high-top sneakers that made my skin crawl.

The vibrant red color was striking, just like a strawberry, but they were also decorated with strawberry pins plastered all over the sides.

It was as if the universe had decided to conspire against me, painting itself in the very image of my trauma.

During my usual phone call with my sister Chloe, I didn't live with my family anymore but I still talked with them every chance I could get.

I unloaded everything that had been happening to me‚Äîthe relentless barrage of strawberries and strawberry-themed items infiltrating my life.

‚ÄúLucas, you‚Äôre just fixating on these things because of what happened. It‚Äôs a common psychological response to trauma,‚Äù Chloe explained gently.

I didn‚Äôt respond; I simply hung up. I wanted to believe her, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that my mind was playing tricks on me, highlighting every strawberry in my line of sight.

Things took a turn for the worse when it felt as though this was no longer just a psychological fixation but rather some cruel cosmic joke.

Apparently, Chloe had filled our parents in on my situation, and in an effort to lift my spirits, my family decided to take me out for dinner at my favorite Italian restaurant that weekend.

Once we were seated and handed the menus, I began to scan the offerings with the keen eyes of a hawk, deliberately steering clear of anything that involved fruit or red sauces.

I settled on a cheesy chicken pasta‚Äîsafe, strawberry-free, and just what I needed.

When the waiter brought our meals and set my cheesy chicken pasta down in front of me, I immediately noticed a single, small strawberry, perfectly sliced, sitting as a garnish beside a sprig of parsley on the plate.¬†

My breath caught in my throat, and I froze, staring at that tiny piece of fruit.

It may have seemed almost insignificant to anyone else, but to me, it felt like a taunting eye, watching my every move.¬†

And honestly, what was a strawberry doing in an Italian restaurant, anyway?

""Is everything alright, Lucas?"" my dad asked, noticing my sudden stillness.

""Yeah, I'm fine,"" I managed to choke out, my voice barely above a whisper.

Trying to be subtle, I picked up that little red intruder with a napkin and dropped it onto a side plate, my hand trembling the entire time.¬†

No one in my family seemed to notice what was happening to me; they were too busy chatting away.

But I noticed, and a cold dread settled in my stomach, a feeling that had nothing to do with hunger.

The following week, Matt, wanting to be a good roommate, suggested we go out for burgers.¬†

""No strawberries, right?"" he joked, clearly aware of my newfound aversion.

When we arrived at the burger joint, I ordered a classic cheeseburger and decided to add a salad for a touch of greenery.¬†

But the moment our order arrived, I spotted it: the largest slice of strawberry I had ever seen, sitting right in the middle of my salad's bed of lettuce.¬†

My stomach twisted, and my jaw clenched as I glanced at Matt, who was happily munching on his cheeseburger. It didn‚Äôt take long for him to finally notice the glaring strawberry on my plate.¬†

""Dude, what the heck? Are you kidding me? I told them not to put strawberries on your salad! Are they doing this on purpose?"" he muttered, glancing back and forth between the strawberry and me.

""I have no idea,"" I replied, my voice heavy with despair as I pushed the salad aside.¬†

Before long, every day turned into a dreadful game of ‚Äúfind the strawberry.‚Äù¬†

My usual fruit cup, despite my insistence on no strawberries, always seemed to have a hidden stash of them at the bottom of the container.¬†

Whenever I ordered a cookie from a coffee shop, it would inevitably be a strawberry cheesecake-flavored cookie.¬†

I read in the newspaper about a new brand of sparkling water set to hit stores next month, and guess what? It was strawberry-flavored‚Äîalways strawberry.¬†

Eventually, I began to withdraw from dining out altogether and started preparing all my meals at home.¬†

And when I did venture out for grocery shopping, my trips turned into lengthy excursions as I meticulously examined the labels of everything, checking the ingredients with an obsessive eye.¬†

My anxiety, which had always been a constant companion, morphed into an all-consuming, suffocating paranoia.¬†

Every night, I found myself trapped in the same haunting nightmare, swimming in an endless ocean of living strawberries. Their seeds seemed to glimmer like tiny, accusatory eyes, watching my every move.

The overwhelming sweetness of it all felt like it was pulling me under, and I'd wake up in a cold sweat, sitting upright in bed, heart racing, struggling to grasp what was happening to me.¬†

During the day, I began noticing those strawberry patterns everywhere, plastered on the wallpaper of every business I entered. The sight would make my mouth feel parched, as if the sun had scorched it dry.

I would see red traffic lights or the blush of a stranger's cheeks, and I couldn't shake the feeling that they were a sinister arrangement. Each flash of red, each round, dimpled shape sent a shock of dread coursing through me.

As time went on, both Matt and my family grew increasingly worried about my spiraling thoughts; they seemed more freaked out than I was.¬†

‚ÄúLucas, maybe you should consider talking to someone, like a therapist,‚Äù my mom suggested one day, her eyes filled with concern.¬†

‚ÄúAnd tell them what exactly? That I‚Äôm being haunted by a fruit? That the universe is deliberately sneaking strawberries into my meals?‚Äù I scoffed, dismissing her concern.

But what was truly happening? Was I genuinely losing my grip on reality? Was this some elaborate prank being played by an unseen force?¬†

Or was it just my mind, traumatized and hyper-aware, fabricating patterns where none existed? Still, how could I rationalize the constant appearances of strawberries in my food, the uncanny coincidences?

Now, I found myself sitting in the dimly lit apartment, blinds drawn tight, with the lights flickering on. Matt had just ordered pizza and dashed off for a quick shower, leaving me on pizza watch.

We had opted for a classic combo: pepperoni, olives, and mushrooms‚Äîno strawberries in sight. I was trying to relearn to enjoy other red foods, but I still longed for a strawberry-free meal.

When the delivery driver finally arrived, I opened the door, paid him, and watched him walk away. With hesitant anticipation, I made my way to the kitchen and opened the pizza box.

Thank goodness the strawberries weren't on the pizza itself, but my relief was short-lived. Right in the center, the little plastic pizza table that keeps the box from touching the cheese was designed to look like a strawberry. What on earth was this? A cruel joke?

My heart raced, and my hands began to tremble. In a fit of frustration, I tossed the pizza box onto the kitchen counter, sending the pizza sliding and creating a gooey, cheesy mess.

I buried my face in my hands, a low, guttural sound escaping from deep within me.

The red plastic strawberry seemed to mock me, staring back from the scattered pepperoni.

What on earth is going on?

1mpkahl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrCreepyPasta/comments/1mpkahl/im_seeing_strawberries_everywhere/,I'm Seeing Strawberries Everywhere,"It all started on what seemed like an ordinary Tuesday, a day where I was stuck in my apartment it seemed so perfectly unremarkable that it felt like any other.

And my main plan was?

To finally wrap up the last season of The X-Files, the show I had been eagerly binge-watching.

As I settled in, I noticed the sunlight dancing off my polished wooden table, creating a warm glow. Next to my laptop, I placed a generous bowl of glistening, ruby-red strawberries.

I had brought them along as a guilt-free snack, thinking they would be the perfect accompaniment to my binge-watching session.

I plopped down in my chair in the living room, fired up for the show, and without much thought, popped a strawberry into my mouth, leaning back with my eyes glued to the laptop screen.

But then came the moment of realization that struck a bit too late. As I bit down, expecting a burst of sweetness, I was instead confronted with an overwhelming sensation that eclipsed everything else.

Suddenly, the strawberry‚Äîperhaps just a piece of it‚Äîlodged itself perfectly in my windpipe.

One moment, I was breathing, and the next, an alarming void replaced the air that should have been flowing in.

My eyes widened in panic, and a scream was caught in my throat, building up but failing to escape.

I tried to cough it out, but the sound that emerged was just a pathetic, wet noise.

In a frenzy, my hands flew to my neck, clawing it and squeezing it in a desperate attempt to dislodge that stubborn piece of fruit.

A sudden chill coursed through me, constricting my senses while my vision was narrowing; my periphery faded into a hazy black void.

My lungs were screaming for air, and each frantic gasp ignited a fiery pain deep within.

I stood up, thrashing wildly, pushing the chair back across the floor in a desperate bid for relief.

I banged on my stomach, hoping that somehow it would help, and resumed clawing at my throat, but nothing was working.¬†

A frantic pulse throbbed inside my skull, taunting me in the suffocating silence.

My face oscillated between burning heat and an icy chill, a creeping numbness creeped in as my legs threatened to give way beneath me.¬†

This was it. To meet my end like this, choking on a strawberry, felt like the most absurd tragedy imaginable.

The ridiculousness of the situation only intensified the sheer terror that gripped me in that moment.

As the shadows began to creep in and I felt myself slipping into a state of panic, I heard the unmistakable sound of the apartment door creaking open.

To my surprise, my roommate Matt walked in, having returned home from work much earlier than expected, and his eyes widened in shock at the sight of me.

It wasn't so easy to meet her since she was now on vacation. Since we are from the same home country and city, and I flew in on Monday, we  met yesterday on Tuesday. 

We first went for a coffee, afterwards for some cake and then at the end sat at a bench and just talked and ate ice cream. When I wanted to stand up and go, she said let's stay a bit longer, I like the conversation. We were just having a normal time and she was even eating from my ice cream and we were sharing cigarettes.

After like 4 1/2 hours, she said she would take a taxi home and I said yes let's go since it was almost midnight. When we went to the taxi place, there were some weird older guys and I asked her on our foreign language if she feels comfortable to hop in with one of them in the alone. She said she's not sure so I hopped on the taxi with her. The guy was talking all the ride long how good I am looking and what a lucky girl she is. When we arrived at her place, I hugged her, said get home well and got back into the taxi to drive home to myself.
From there on, no communication and I woke up this morning with her unfollowing me everywhere.

I texted her that she could have gave me at least a text saying she doesn't want to meet anymore and could've given me one or two sentences before she just unfollowed. No answer.

I'm really really disappointed because I thought we had a good day. I came and paid for everything, acted like a gentleman and tried to be cool in the vibe with her, especially since we talked for over a month and then she did this? 
It can't be the optics, since we were facetiming for weeks. And I really didn't try anything during the date. Just talked about every possible topic.
Nobody ever did this to me even if we don't clicked. And I never had the heart to do this to anyone, especially after weeks and weeks of calls. Like wtf? If wasn't a hookup date or a date after 2-3 days of text, we talked for weeks and she said she's happy I'm now in town.

I‚Äôve seen many suggestions for khamrah and people have said Qahwa was more dark with that coffee note so I decided to give it a try.

First hour of spraying it on my skin, it gave me an instant headache. The opening is so synthetic and spicy, but I do have to admit, all of the notes are there. If you‚Äôre looking for a powerful sillage, this is the fragrance.

To me, it leans towards the more feminine side, but can still be unisex.

It‚Äôs been 5-6h now and it is still very strong and I can smell it even though it‚Äôs been on me, and I haven‚Äôt gone nose blind to it. It is still very spicy and the cinnamon note is pungent for sure.

I think I‚Äôm going to return it tomorrow though, because I just can‚Äôt see myself wearing it.

It smells like you dropped 5 Christmas candles and every single spice hits you. Just not what I‚Äôm looking for.

Thinking about this made me reflect on my own journey. Not too long ago, I was just *coasting through*, relying on my job security like it was a comfy blanket. But let me tell you, that blanket is starting to fray! üòÖ

**Why do we need to jump on the AI train?** Here are a few eye-openers:

- **Job Automation Fears:** It‚Äôs 2023, folks. Robots are already taking over a fair share of tasks. Ever heard about those chatbots? They‚Äôre making some customer service roles about as obsolete as your grandma‚Äôs flip phone. üò¨
  
- **Income Disparity Widening:** Those who upskill in AI and tech are cashing in on the sweet, sweet bucks while others are left in the dust. Are you ready to embrace the change or risk being outpaced by your peers?

- **Future Career Opportunities:** The **demand** for AI skills is skyrocketing like a TikTok dance challenge. If you can harness these skills, you're not just getting a job; you‚Äôre opening doors to so many more. 

So, how do you upskill without feeling like you‚Äôre swallowing a textbook whole? Here‚Äôs a little game plan I‚Äôve cooked up for us:

1. **Get Yourself Educated:** There are loads of courses out there, much like endless pizza options on a Friday night. üçï For example, check out this helpful educational program I stumbled upon: [Imagine AI Education](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). It might just be the cheat code you need! 

2. **Small, Daily Doses:** You don‚Äôt have to sacrifice your entire weekend pouring over algorithms. A *little bit* every day goes a long way! Maybe dedicate 15 minutes to an AI podcast or an article during your coffee break?

3. **Join a Community:** Surrounding yourself with others who are also learning can make it fun. Just like studying for finals in college with your pals‚Äîit‚Äôs way more effective (and way less boring).

4. **Experiment and Apply:** Wrap your head around it by trying your hand at real projects. It‚Äôs like cooking: the more you practice, the better you get. And trust me, someday you‚Äôll have a feast your friends will envy!

I‚Äôm not here trying to be all ‚Äúdoom and gloom,‚Äù but this is *real talk*. It‚Äôs all about working smarter, not harder, and adapting to this new world. So, who‚Äôs with me? Are you feeling that itch to learn more about AI or maybe you‚Äôve already dabbled in it? 

Let‚Äôs share some thoughts, experiences, or even the occasional meme about AI! After all, we‚Äôre all in this together, right? üí™‚ú®",1,1755127496.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Amelia

""The floors on the first floor need to be moped again Amelia. You did a shitty job. I can still see tracks."" Bianca's cold, venom-laced demand is enough to make me want to go into a fit of rage and burn this whole damn pack house down. I have moped that floor twice today, yet it still is not up to her standards. The Alpha knew exactly what he was doing, giving his only daughter supervision rights over my workload this week.

Bianca is rude, but she has also trained to be a Luna her entire life and fills part of that role now that her mother is gone, so crossing her would be a mistake punishable by death and I think he would order it just to have something to do.

""I think you missed some weeds in father's garden yesterday so you should check it again today. Also, the walls of the dining hall need washed down again. If I need to appoint someone to follow you around all day, I will."" She threatens and I shudder thinking about how much worse that would be. Especially since the person assigned to me will not want to be supervising me, which will make it worse.

Instead of boiling over with rage, I turned to her, ""I am sorry. I will get right to it."" because arguing will make the punishments worse, and I really don't want any dungeon time. It is cold, smells, and the food is slop when they remember to feed you and to this pack, I am easy to forget.

I am a nobody to the Feathermark Pack. An outsider found by a fellow pack member at the border 24 years ago at just 18 months old. I have no memory of how I got here and no memory of my real family.

I do not even know if Amelia is my real name.

I was taken in as an orphan. The elder she-wolves in the pack took turns raising me, none of them pleasant. Everyone treated me like a burden instead of a family or pack member. They do not like outsiders here, but they fear being cursed by the fates for refusing and orphan more, so I bounced around from member to member who really had no desire to raise me until my teens when I was enlisted as a slave for the pack.

I hate my life.

I keep quiet.

Keep my head down.

Nobody here knows me, truly.

I wear hand-me-down rags and sleep in a tiny home made for me or the dungeon. It really depends on how the Alpha feels for the day. At least the tiny home has a bathroom. The dungeon has a bucket. I prefer seclusion with a toilet over a bucket. If being quiet keeps my ass on the porcelain throne and my face from getting slapped around, I will do it, but I don't like it.

Years of this torment have piled up. Every day I fear that I am near my breaking point. On a good day I daydream of burning the pack down while I watch and smile at my tormentors getting burned.

On a difficult day, I envision ending it all.

On an in-between, more sane day, I daydream that I have escaped to some unknown pack, and they welcomed me as one of their own.

I haven't made any recent escape attempts. The last few ended in my being found by the border patrol and brought back fighting for my life. The whipping I received publicly was enough to stave off the urge to flee and the physical scars will stay with me forever.

The pack members laughing and making a mockery of my suffering is something I will never forget. I will forever carry a grudge against the entire pack and hope that one day they will get a harvest on the seeds they have sewn into my life.

I arrive at the first floor and just as I expected, the floor looks clean, but if there isn't a new shine to it and evidence it was recently moped, I will pay for it, so I re-do the floors. My back aches from being hunched over all day moping and from pulling the weeds yesterday. An ache for a shifter is a rarity, but I am a weak wolf because I am not allowed to shift to take part in runs, or train which means, I must endure it.

I am allowed to do nothing except work all day long, run errands within the pack and wait on whoever Alpha Randall demands that I wait on when he has guest. Usually, guests have no manners and are just as cold and disgusting as the Alpha here or they are visiting Alphas that enjoy the idea of having a slave the entire visit. Sometimes that get touchy, other times they get inappropriate.

The evil lurking in this pack is the Alpha. Alpha Randall Feathemark is old, calloused, and cruel. He leads by oppression. The pack members act like him towards me partly because of how he treats them. I have heard whispers from others of him only becoming cruel because his mate died, but I have only known his cruelty and hatred. I have never seen him find anything amusing unless it was the punishment of others. I have only seen him happy when discussing money or taking over territory.

I finish mopping the entire floor and then return the supplies to the utility room. It is supper time here and now I must wait until the entire pack has eaten before I can go and ask for whatever is left, and it is usually not much. The mess hall fills, and I stand in the corner and watch everyone eat their fill, gorging themselves in their indulgence while I suffer and wait to be beckoned.

I weave in and out of tables, playing the role as a waitress, barely tolerating the tones and the sneers of the shifters that see me as nothing but garbage. I refuse to show any emotion to them. They think they are better than everybody because they are a wealthy pack, but I see them as nothing more than a disease that needs eradication. Any pack that functions like this one needs to be wiped off the planet.

After I play waitress, I clean up the mess hall and then eat the half of a sandwich they offer me. I am expected to have the energy to work to the bone but not given the sustenance to withstand it.

Heading back to my tiny home I am thanking the fates that I was able to stay out of trouble tonight and not have to sleep in the dungeon. I throw off my too small boots and head for my cot. Dead on my feet, I shake out my long, wavy chocolate brown hair and put it back up in a bun on top of my head. I remove my ratty jeans and kick them off into the corner of the room. I am too tired to wash them tonight. Everything will have to wait until tomorrow.

# The Bars Between Us

Amelia

I can barely get my eyes open after four hours of sleep and it is time to get up and get going to make the entire pack breakfast. They don't make the kitchen staff prepare breakfast because nobody wants to get up at 4am to start it.

My body hurts all over as I drag myself up, quickly brush my teeth, pull my hair up and put my pants back on before heading out my door. My house is a mile away from the pack house and I have to walk it. If I shift and they find out I am in deep shit. I can only shift when I can get away with sneaking it in.

Why? Because I am not one of them and apparently, I am considered less than a wolf, so they don't let me shift. I sneak a shift occasionally, it is late at night and only when I feel like I am going to crawl out of my skin from too much energy. It is rare since I am worked to death daily and use all my energy that way, but sometimes it happens.

I should be afraid to walk out her alone in the dark, but I don't sense any shifters around. It isn't the monsters in the dark I must worry about. It is the shifters under my nose. I would welcome the monsters in the dark. Alpha Randall is always talking about borders, and allies. Always scheming and plotting like the packs are his personal chest pieces. He starts unnecessary wars, and his specialty is trying to control most of the trade market. Price gouging gives him wet dreams, I'm sure.

I had breakfast competed for the one hundred shifters by 6:30 am and headed to Alpha‚Äôs residence to start his breakfast. Alpha Randall enters the dining room, and I quickly pull out his chair, keeping my head down to seat him. He offers no gestures as he scoots himself in and awaits my arrival with his food.

I make his plate, making sure it is filled to the brim with everything he likes and take it to him. I leave and get his coffee and upon my return, I can overhear him discussing an important Alpha coming to the pack tomorrow. Wonderful. Important visitors mean extra work on top of whatever else Randall will want me to do for the visiting Alpha.

""Did you do something different with the coffee this morning Amelia?"" Alpha Randall questions and I know that I have screwed up somehow or he is looking for a fight.

""No sir."" I say with my eyes pointing down to the floor. I am not allowed to look at him in the eyes unless he tells me to and when he does, I am screwed.

""Well, it tastes like shit. Go make me a new pot, now!"" he bellows at me, and I hurry off to start a fresh pot. I try some of it first before pouring it all out and of course, to me, it tastes fine. I roll my eyes and continue serving others as I wait on the coffee.

Once it is done, I take a fresh cup of black coffee and set it down in front of him. ""Did you try some of that coffee before you dumped it out?"" he asks, and I involuntarily lick my lips. ""You did. I know you did. Did I tell you to try it? To question me? To doubt what I was talking about? Are you supposed to eat anything before your work is done?""

Yep. I am screwed. ""I.."" I don't get to finish my sentence before he is up and backhanding me. The world tilts as I crumble to the floor. My face stung instantly where his hand smacked me. I know that it is better to stay down, so I do.

""You two, get over here and drag her to the dungeon. Maybe some time away will remind her that she is to follow instructions.""

""No...No..Please No... don‚Äôt do this."" I beg but it is ignored. Two shifters grab me by my arms and start hauling me out of the pack house and across the grounds to a small outbuilding that is a ruse to house the dungeon beneath it. Tears well in my eyes as I start to pull away from them and kick my feet. I hate it down there. I won't go willingly.

I kick out, but it does no good. Compared to these shifters, I am a waif. Skin and bones courtesy of my slim food rations. My blue green eyes are always dull and lifeless. Dark bags are a permanent fixture here. My chocolate brown hair is dull and half a rat's nest on a good day. Today isn't a good day. I look like shit, feel like shit, and now I am going to rot in a place that can be described the same way. At least if they forget about me down here, I can get out of all the cleaning and this stupid guest Alpha.

I am hauled down the stairs and thrown into a cell. The guards close the door and the bars rattle. The air is cold and damp being underground. The cot is lumpy and full of straw. One used bucket sits in the corner, and I know if I look at it, I will probably vomit up all my stomach acid, so I don't. I bring my knees up and fold my arms around them and rest my forehead on my knees.

I don't know how much time goes by before I realize that I am not alone down here. I lift my head, and I can see bent legs and forearms resting on them in the cell next to mine. The prisoner's face is obscured by the shadows he sits in. He smells like an Alpha.

""What are you in for?"" he asks with a deep, husky voice. I can tell it has been a while since he has had anything to drink.

""I... I tried a sip of coffee."" I can't see his face, but I can feel his eyes watching me as he waits for me to explain further, but I don't. He lets out a soft laugh.

""Wow and they think I'm the asshole. How does a pack member get imprisoned over coffee?""

""They don't consider me a pack member. I am their slave. They treat me as such."" I explain and he makes a hmmm sound, taking it in.

""Are you not from here?""

""No. They found me when I was a baby.""

""And that doesn't make you a pack member? Growing up here?""

""No."" I explain. ""I wouldn't ever want to be one either. They are cruel here. Disgusting shifters. A disgrace. They will let me out soon. An Alpha from another pack is coming and they will make me wait on him hand and foot plus the entire pack and the chores.""

""Why don't you leave?"" he asks.

""I can't. They bring me back and whip me."" The stranger starts growling and I squeeze myself tighter, thankful for the bars between us.

One Wish

Amelia

I awoke from a nap on this lumpy cot and the dread that I thought I would feel waking up, still down here, is surprisingly absent. Maybe it is all about perspective and outlook. If they keep me down here, then I am not cleaning, or weeding, or mowing, or anything really so that is a plus. Maybe it is because I am not alone down here for once. I sit up and see the shifter still in the shadows of his cell.

""She's alive. You were so asleep I had started to wonder if your little heart gave out."" he told me causing me to roll my eyes.

""You would sleep sound in a dungeon too if you rarely got any sleep."" I inform him and he says nothing.

""They came down earlier with some oatmeal looking slop. I saved you some."" he surprises me by pushing a bowl toward the bars of his cell with his foot.

""I'm not allowed to eat until all the work is done."" I tell him.

""I don't see anyone down here that would find out."" He is right about that. We are alone, but too many times I have thought I could get away with something and end up getting punished horribly. I don't want to chance it. Plus, with the Alpha coming tomorrow, they are bound to let me out at some point.

""You keep it. You will need your strength for whatever they have planned for you. They will let me out eventually. Someone has to be their slave and with the Alpha coming tomorrow, I have a ton of shit to get done.""

He leaves the bowl where it is at, never moving. ""If you could leave here, would you?"" he asks.

""In a heartbeat."" I answer, not even having to think. Who wouldn't in my shoes? He is quiet for a while and then asks,

""If you could have one wish, what would it be?"" I answer before thinking, ""To wake up and find all of these miserable bastards dead.""

""Truly? You would be fine with the whole pack gone?""

""Would I normally want an entire pack annihilated from existence? No. Would I want the pack that has spent every day of my entire life I can remember treating my like garbage, beating me, whipping me, and quite literally ruining my life? Yes. I guess I would spare women with pups, but there isn't many. Every shifter here has either turned a blind eye or took part in brutalizing me. There is no place for mercy here. They are all despicable,""

I lean my head back against the cold stone walls and close my eyes, daydreaming of the scenario I just imagined. It brings a smile to my face. I can hear the shifter in the shadows laughing. No doubt finding humor in my darkness.

""I agree with you, little warrior."" I lift my head and turn it in his direction.

""I am not a warrior. Far from it. I am weak and frail, not by choice, but I am regardless.""

""You have a warrior spirit, wanting to break free. It is fed with years of anger and resentment. When you come into yourself, it will be magnificent to see."" he says quietly, and I contemplate his words.

""What about you? What is your one wish?"" I asked the stranger.

""Hmm...I wish for you to get out of here, to be free and to have you revenge on those here.""

""That is more than one wish, but why waste your wish on me?""

""It is not a waste if you can use it. I also don't need it.""

""Why don't you need it? Wouldn't you want to leave the dungeon? Escape?""

""I am only here because I allow it, little warrior. Sometimes the best intel to gather is from putting yourself behind enemy lines.""

I think to myself confused. The Feathermark Pack has enemies, I am sure. I mean all shifter packs usually have a problem over borders or with rogues. Could this shifter be a rogue leader of sorts? I don't hear Randall discussing problems with any other packs, but there could be. There are also legends you hear about other packs. Rumors and experiences about battles passed down throughout the years.

""Do you know how many pack members there are here?"" he asks.

""Around 100.""

""How are the fighters here? Any good?""

""They have fighters, cruel ones that will do anything Alpha Randall tells them to, without questioning it. Most in this pack care more about trading and goods, what they wear and eat vs the safety and wellbeing of the pack though.

""Any secret bunkers or other dungeons I need to know about?""

""I don't think so. I am only thrown down in this one.""

""How many times do they throw you down here?""

""Whenever they feel like it."" I tell him and I can hear a low growl that he is trying to get control over.

The door opens above the stairs and light starts pouring in, but I still can't see the face of the stranger thanks to the poor health of my wolf. Michael starts down the stairs and comes toward my cell. Any guard would be more welcome than him. He is handsy, disgusting and smells like piss. He probably barely washes, and he has no problems smacking me and throwing me around.

I hate him and I am afraid of him.

Alpha knows that, probably why he sent him to retrieve me. I suddenly could stay down here forever and be simply fine with it. I push myself back into the corner of my cot and ball myself up tighter. The stranger must be scenting my fear because I can sense an uptick in Alpha aura, and it certainly isn't Michael. This stranger is an Alpha, and he keeps his strength suppressed.

Smart.

""Well, well, well. Look what we have here. A naughty she-wolf found herself in the dungeon again. What did you do this time? Hmmm?"" I say nothing. I don't even look over at him.

""I am talking to you."" he says and kicks the bars of my cell forcefully, causing me to jump. He pulls out keys from his belt loop and starts to unlock my cell. The stranger in the cell next to mine starts growling. Michael doesn't bother looking in his direction. He obviously doesn't view him as a threat. He should. I can sense his aura rising before he tamps it back down.

""Get up. Alpha wants you to get to work. He wants everything spotless for the guest tomorrow and he wants you to get the guest rooms prepared and the work done before nightfall."" Michael growls at me.

""That is impossible! I have been down here too long! I can't get that kind of work done in time."" I plead with him, desperation clear in my voice.

""I guess you won't stop to eat or sleep then will you. Get up and get it done!"" he yells. I make no move to get up and he grabs me by my arm and drags me from the cot.

""Let go of me!"" I pull back and away from him far enough to kick at him, but he just tightens his grip more and slams me into the bars of my cell. I am disoriented as I lift my head and see the world around me turn on its axis and then I realize I am on the ground.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal sofa and table set should offer a blend of comfort, durability, style, and functionality. The following features are crucial to consider when making your selection.

**Sofa Material and Construction:** Selecting the right sofa material is essential for both comfort and longevity.

High-quality fabrics like linen,cotton blends,and microfiber are popular choices due to their durability and ease of maintenance. Leather sofas offer a luxurious feel and are known for their resilience, but they require more specialized care. The internal frame of the sofa should be constructed from solid hardwood for maximum stability and support. reinforced joints and quality stitching are indicators of superior craftsmanship and will contribute to the sofa's overall lifespan.

**Table Material and Finish:** The choice of material for your table determines its durability, aesthetic, and maintenance requirements.

Solid wood tables offer a timeless appeal and extraordinary durability, while engineered wood options provide a more affordable option.Metal tables can add a modern touch and are often paired with glass or wood tops.Consider the finish of the table, ensuring it is resistant to scratches, stains, and water damage. A durable finish will protect the table's surface and keep it looking its best for years to come.**Sofa Dimensions and Seating Capacity:** Carefully consider the dimensions of your living space and the number of people you typically need to accommodate.

Measure your room and map out the layout before selecting a sofa. Ensure that there is enough space to move around comfortably and that the sofa does not overwhelm the room. Consider the seating capacity of the sofa and choose a size that will comfortably accommodate your family and guests.Sectional sofas are ideal for larger spaces and offer ample seating, while smaller sofas are better suited for apartments or smaller living rooms.

**Table Size and Shape:** The size and shape of your table should complement the sofa and fit proportionally within the room.A coffee table should be approximately two-thirds the length of the sofa and positioned about 18 inches away from it.Side tables should be placed within reach of seating areas and should be tall enough to hold lamps, drinks, and other essentials.

Consider the color, texture, and overall design of the furniture to create a cohesive and harmonious look in your living space. Pay attention to details such as the shape of the legs, the style of the upholstery, and the hardware used, as these elements can significantly impact the overall aesthetic.**comfort and Ergonomics:** Comfort is paramount when choosing a sofa.

Look for features such as supportive cushions, a comfortable backrest, and a suitable seat depth. Consider the firmness of the cushions and choose a level of support that suits your preferences. Ergonomic design elements, such as a slightly reclined backrest and adequate lumbar support, can enhance comfort and promote good posture. Test the sofa before purchasing it to ensure that it feels comfortable and supportive.

## faqs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about choosing the right sofa and table set.

**what is the best material for a sofa if I have pets?**
For pet owners, durable and easy-to-clean materials like microfiber, leather, or tightly woven fabrics are ideal. These materials are resistant to scratches, stains, and pet hair, making them easy to maintain.

Avoid delicate fabrics like velvet or silk, as they are more susceptible to damage from pets. Regularly vacuuming and cleaning your sofa can help to keep it looking its best.

**How do I determine the right size coffee table for my sofa?**
A good rule of thumb is that the coffee table should be approximately two-thirds the length of the sofa. It should also be positioned about 18 inches away from the sofa to allow for comfortable legroom.

Consider the height of the coffee table, ensuring that it is indeed no higher than the seat cushions of the sofa. Measure your space carefully and choose a coffee table that fits proportionally within the room.

**what are some tips for arranging a sofa and table in a small living room?**
In a small living room, prioritize functionality and space-saving solutions. Choose a smaller sofa or loveseat to avoid overwhelming the room.

Opt for a coffee table with storage to maximize space. Consider using nesting tables that can be easily stored when not in use. Arrange furniture away from the walls to create a more open and airy feel. Use mirrors to create the illusion of more space.

1mpk1n7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1mpk1n7/articlei_was_crushed_by_my_diagnosis_but_this/,"[Article]I Was Crushed by My Diagnosis, But This Simple Practice Brought Me Back","I used to think I was invincible. I was thirty, living in Texas, working as a programmer, and treating my body like an afterthought. All nighters on caffeine, drinking until sunrise, chain smoking whenever stress hit, doomscrolling until my eyes burned. If I could still show up to work, I figured I was fine.

Then came my company‚Äôs annual health check. I almost skipped it. But the report smacked me in the face: early stage chronic gastritis with erosions in my stomach lining. Not cancer. Not deadly‚Ä¶ yet. The doctor warned me that if I kept living like this, it could turn into something much worse.

At first, I brushed it off. Then the symptoms started: constant bloating, sharp stomach pains after heavy meals. I even got nauseous during the meetings. The worst was lying awake at 3 am, clutching my stomach, hating myself for ignoring the warning signs.

One random night, I was scrolling through my phone and came across a line from Papillon: ‚ÄúYour greatest sin is wasting your life.‚Äù I thought, If I died tomorrow, my legacy would be hangovers, a shelf of unread books, and a worn out laptop. That thought broke me.

I quit smoking overnight. Cut alcohol to maybe once a month. Set a strict bedtime, and keep my eyes shut, even when my mind refuses to rest. Started eating lighter, earlier dinners. I put screen limits on my phone and swapped late night scrolling for reading and listening to podcasts. The first week was hell. My body screamed for the old habits. But after a month, my mornings didn‚Äôt feel like a punishment anymore.
Reading became my anchor. Not just for distraction, but for rewiring my brain. Books gave me frameworks for discipline, self awareness, and long term thinking. A few standouts:
Atomic Habits by James Clear, this book ruined all my excuses. Clear makes behavior change feel not just simple but inevitable, with practical ways to break bad habits and replace them with small, consistent wins. I kept it on my desk like a manual. 

What I do is to pair that with The Untethered Soul by Michael A. Singer, which cracked open the realization that so much of my mental suffering was self created. If you‚Äôve ever felt trapped in your own head, his writing feels like someone opening a window to let fresh air in. 
And then, Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker is just like a wakeup call for me. Realizing how much sleep fuels my health and mind turned me into a near saint about protecting my bedtime. Together, these books shifted how I live, my habits, my inner world, and even the way I rest.
When I felt too mentally drained for full books, I found a hack that kept me learning without frying my brain: BeFreed. A friend introduced me, it‚Äôs a smart reading and book summary app built by a team from Columbia University. Perfect for when you‚Äôre working full time & barely have energy left. It turns dense nonfiction into podcast style episodes in different lengths: 10 min quick hits, 20 min recaps, or 40 min deep dives. I even customized my podcast host to be a non judgemental, chill best friend. It feels like we are catching up over coffee. The AI actually learns about your life, struggles, and goals, like my adult ADHD and the demands of my job, and builds a personalized learning roadmap that adapts over time. Now I‚Äôve knocked out books I‚Äôd been ‚Äúmeaning to read‚Äù for years, The Selfish Gene,Cosmos, Poor Charlie‚Äôs Almanack. It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs made reading as addictive as doomscrolling.

I also leaned on other free, high value resources. The Ten Percent Happier Podcast gave me practical, mindfulness based tools for stress, sleep, and focus that I could apply immediately. The YouTube channel Better Ideas kept me inspired with short, cinematic takes on self discipline and meaning. Together, these turned my downtime into actual fuel for growth instead of a black hole.

Now my life is unrecognizable. I wake up earlier without hating it. I take morning walks. I cook for myself more than I order in. Nights out are about connection, not numbing myself. I‚Äôve been to Burningman, the Grand Canyon, Georgia coast, places I always said I‚Äôd go ‚Äúsomeday.‚Äù I even started horseback riding and golf just to prove to myself I can still learn new skills.

The health checks still make me nervous, but they also remind me how far I‚Äôve come. They‚Äôre no longer about waiting for bad news, they‚Äôre proof I‚Äôm investing in myself. If I could go back, I‚Äôd start sooner. You don‚Äôt need a life threatening diagnosis to change your life. You just need to pay attention before your body forces you to.

I went to mini vacation (5 days) with my SO, SD(11), and our two BS(4Y and 10M baby). As the title says, this was my first vacation with her, and it will be my last. She is immature, selfish, and has a case of  ""learned helplessness"". My 4 year old son is better regulated than her. I always knew this, I just didn't know the extent of it. Couple of situations that put me in a defensive mode and made my decision firm are:

- Every single thing we bought or my son ate was followed with a question ""And for me?"" They have the same treatment, always, except when it's something age related. I can't imagine a 11 year old girl enjoying games for small kids, but there she was, doing the same thing as a 4 year old, so she doesn't feel excluded. She got something that he didn't, because he didn't  wanted every single thing for him, like she did. 

- Knowing how they fight about the most stupid things, because she doesn't want to just let go, EVER, and does a lot of things out of spite - I bought them two of everything I planned for my son. Two sets of play dough, two sets of crayons, everything. The only different thing were some stickers, but there were enough for them to share, and she wanted them for herself only. I said to my son just give them to her, and come here to paint with me. Oh, and I grabbed a thick pile of printing paper so they can draw on it, and she asked me how many papers are there, because she wanted them to be divided equally. 

- Whenever we sat in the restaurant or Caff√® or whatever, if she wanted something to eat or drink, it was fine. But, if my son wanted something else, there was always that dreaded sentence ""And for me?"" No one denied anything to her, she is just competitive or some sh*t, I don't know.

- She was always complaining about something. Her stomach hurt her just when we finally sat down and ordered coffee to drink it in peace or how her arm hurts her so much that she complained all the way to the end of one of our walks. She even complained to her mom. Her mom called her like 5-6h later to ask her if her arm still hurts. I was like wtf? She tried to blame a 4 year old kid for the pain, saying he pulled her strongly. SO reminded her that she pulled her arm herself a couple of minutes ago while trying to pull up something in the kids park. Oh, and her stomach pain magically dissappeared when we left the Caff√® because she was in pain. Before we all went to the hotel, I suggested to my SO to go to the hotel with her, and I will gladly stay with the boys. I wanted a pause from her and I really wanted a moment for myself to drink one nice cup of coffee while they are calm. SO didn't do that, he always wanted all of us to be together. I didn't push it, and she said: oh, you can't enjoy your coffee now. I'm sorry. Yeah, no, you're not sorry. Everything has to revolve around you - again. 

- She asked how come our son can do something and she can't? It was so random, I don't even remember what it was. We explained to her that she can't compare herself with a kid almost 3x younger than her, and it's impossible to have exactly the same set of rules for both kids, depending on their needs and everything. I hated that I have to justify myself to a kid. 

- She asked us at one point to remind her  where are we. I couldn't believe how can an 11 year old kid ask that kind of question. I would place my bet on a 4 year old to ask that. Four year old knew the name of the place, and told her.

- I was on the phone, SO took the baby to sleep, and she suddenly started looking for her phone charger. I told her I'm on the phone, can't help now, and she goes straight to the bedroom to ask my SO for it. She didn't care that someone else's needs were more important in that moment.

So, in conclusion, out of three children aged 10 months, 4Y and 11Y, the easiest was with a baby, believe it or not. 

These are some of the highlights of her behavior. There are plenty more of those, but I guess these are the ones that annoyed me the most. 

Never again, never again. 

P. S. Sorry for the mistakes in writing, English is my 2nd language.

We've both always felt the other was ""the one who got away"". We just spent 5 days together on a trip seeking closure but now I find myself asking whether I chase the 'what if?' or try to let it go. Maybe this is too rare to ignore?

**+**

I (M, 30) met a girl (F, 31) 10 years ago when we were 20 and 21, and we quickly fell in love and started dating. The relationship ended after 6 months on account of her graduating university and moving to another state for work. It was always understood that things would be short-lived as neither of us were studying in a state we were from and we both knew that we would have to go in different directions to pursue things after college. We were each other's first loves, despite having both been in relationships before. It is hard to overstate just how formative our relationship was for both of us.   
  
After breaking up  in December 2015, we saw each another again -- 3 months after we first said goodbye; again 3 months after that (6 months after breakup); and a final time 3 months after that (9 months after breakup). Each time we reverted to being ""a couple"" and each time was painful saying goodbye. After that we stayed in touch for another year or so but I eventually cut communication as I was finding it too difficult to move on. That was in 2017. After that, I dated a lot but I never found anything comparable to what we had had. I often felt like I had become a more cynical  person.  
  
In 2019, I was in a relationship and so was she, she called me out of the blue and told me that she felt like there remained a lingering question mark over  ‚Äúus‚Äù  and that she would like to meet to discuss it. I felt the same way but we lived on opposite sides of the world by then and I eventually said we could not continue speaking as it was not fair to ourselves or to our partners. From September 2019 onwards, we didn‚Äôt speak at all. 

Of course, I often thought about her or wondered how she was. And I reflected on how in love I had been with her, often comparing it to my relationships subsequent to that one. But overall, I had grown used to missing her and the idea that things would never really ‚Äúwork out‚Äù as we lived different lives (not ethically, but logistics and location made it practically impossible we would ever be in the same country, let alone city, without planning to be).¬†I had a few relationships, including some that lasted 2+ years and which were  emotionally deep. For various reasons, these relationships ended. At the same time, she had a 4-year relationship and co-habited with her partner but it ended  due to his infidelity.

In January 2025 she reached out to me. She was in my city and suggested we grab a coffee, along with a mutual friend. We grabbed a drink, the three of us. Shortly after that meeting, we spoke on the phone and we both said we felt there remained a lack of closure over our relationship and  we should meet to talk about it and to simply spend time in one another‚Äôs company.¬†  
  
We eventually booked a trip together to Philadelphia and met there, seeing each other for only the second time since 2016. It was lovely. We fell back into being like a couple for 5 days. had the best time and the ease of our communication and companionship and my attraction to her all just came back exactly as they always were. We stayed in the same place, slept together, and just had fun. We both acknowledged that what we were looking for was closure ‚Ä¶ that this trip may just be some sort of ‚Äúsad goodbye‚Äù.¬†Now, I am back to holding my breath, waiting to meet someone who blows her out of the water. I find myself wondering, ‚Äúwhat the hell am I doing?‚Äù

In my life I have been fortunate to date several truly remarkable women and, while she is amazing, she is not head and shoulders above anyone else in a purely theoretical sense. On paper, I can see that this woman is no more beautiful than other people I‚Äôve dated; or necessarily smarter; or more charming; or easy to get along with; etc. etc. The difference is that it just feel like it makes sense when I‚Äôm with her‚Ä¶. It is just DIFFERENT with her. In a way it felt like being able to breathe again after holding my breath for years.

Thanks for all the tips, guides and stories in this sub.  It really helped me to start the caffeine abstinence. My first try two years ago lasted 6 weeks. Felt good but failed to maintain. 

Now driven by a lot of stress at work, which I only made worse by drinking lots of coffee, I started my second attempt. I‚Äôm 3 weeks in complete caffeine free and feeling way calmer. Actually a few people at work asked me if everything was okay, because of my change in mood. But it feels good! 

But there is one thing very different It seems I am way more shy than with caffeine. I have a team to lead at work where shyness is really not helpful I‚Äôm almost reserved in front of employees. During my meetings in front of the team I struggle with shyness. Before quitting speaking in front of people was one of my strengths. 

I read in this sub it could be due to changes in brain hormones and could last 1-3 months until everything is back to normal. I really hope for that because right now I‚Äôm to shy for my job‚Ä¶

1mpjq8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodLosAngeles/comments/1mpjq8b/review_evangeline_swamp_room/,Review: Evangeline Swamp Room,"Was here with a few friends on a Tuesday evening (8:30ish) and was cautiously optimistic having seen good reviews and a menu that looked like a best hits album of NOLA food and cocktails. Now I‚Äôve only been to New Orleans once, but it was enough to have tasted just about every offering on the Swamp Room menu. (Un?)fortunately, I did not try everything Swamp Room had to offer. What I did try was a bit of an insult. We had already eaten dinner, so our primary fare was drinks. I ordered a classic, the vieux carre, hoping the kitschy sports bar interior (complete with an AI swamp video set high in the corner for visual ambiance) was just an ironic attempt to mimic the numerous tourist traps present in the Big Easy. If so, the irony extended to their drinks as well. 

I‚Äôll put it this way, a bar like this should stick to beer and maybe a house wine. I knew even before sniffing it that it would be bad, mainly due to the glassware. One of those thick, unchilled v-shaped rocks glasses that come standard with every dive bar mixed drink. The vermouth stood out as the worst offense - either it had gone bad or just wasn‚Äôt good to begin with. At least I got a whiskey-soaked maraschino cherry out of it. At $18, all I want is a properly stirred drink with a decent vermouth and bitters. Maybe an expressed lemon peel if you‚Äôre feeling fancy. My friends‚Äô drinks weren‚Äôt any better. The grasshopper: the best of the bunch, but only because it‚Äôs a sweet, fluffy dessert. No balance whatsoever.
Frozen Irish coffee: this one comes out of a slushie machine and should have been a no-brainer. Admittedly, I did not try this one but my friends said it tasted wrong, like gasoline. We sent it back and the bartender agreed, saying there must be something wrong with the machine.
Hurricane: y‚Äôall, it‚Äôs lemon, passion fruit, and a whole lot of rum. In this version, I received a mouthful of high fructose corn syrup with some fruit punch flavoring agents. At least it was strong.

The service was sluggish. Our drinks came out one at a time and a few minutes apart. The bartenders seemed a bit bewildered, but I think they were actually just a little embarrassed, like a kid who half-assed his report and is taking his sweet time to get up in front of the class to read it. I wouldn‚Äôt say it was good service, but they weren‚Äôt actively rude so I won‚Äôt dock them too much. I felt their shame.

This is making me sad, so I‚Äôll keep the food piece brief. We ordered the $26 half dozen charbroiled oysters. We weren‚Äôt expecting Drago‚Äôs exactly, but man, these were‚Ä¶not good. This might be on us for ordering post-dinner oysters at what is essentially a dive bar on a summer evening, but hey, it was on the menu. What we got were 6 steaming hot oysters sitting under a melted but strangely cool dollop of grated cheese with some scattered bacon bits. The oysters were way over-grilled (if that is how they were heated) and the toppings were undercooked. A true conundrum. We tried three and called it a day.
Our friends‚Äô french fries: solid.

All told, we won‚Äôt be coming back. I don‚Äôt have high hopes for any of the other food on their menu. Maybe it was just a bad night or they‚Äôre still working out the kinks, but at $75 (tax + tip included) for two dive bar cocktails and half a dozen inedible oysters, it isn‚Äôt worth it for me to find out.",3,1755126404.0,FoodLosAngeles,1,1.0,False

The bin is now mostly fungus gnats, pot worms, and tiny white beetle-like bugs (not springtails), with only about 50 red wigglers I could find. There was also a lot of dryer lint, which I‚Äôve mostly removed (and I‚Äôm not reusing much of the old castings).

This would be akin to a user typing ""best running shoes Nike Hoka"" instead of just ""best running shoe""   
  
GPT-5 is also defaulting to certain sources. When asked ""what are the best large SUVs for families, it one time referenced ""US News"" in the query and another time ""Consumer Reports"" - which means it only looked for those results.  
  
From what we can tell, is happening about 30-50% of the time.   It appears to be a consequence of GPT-5's reasoning. In its reasoning, GPT-5 says ""we should use trusted resources like Consumer Reports"" and then next includes ""Consumer Reports"" in the query.   
  
If you are a consumer and want a larger variety of sources and more recent sources, say you want the ""latest"" or ""newest"" in your ChatGPT query. We found that when those words are used, it is less likely to use brands.   
  
if you are associated with a popular top-of-mind brand a looking to improve your visibility, congratulations! Your brand will likely be included even more strongly in the AI search results of ChatGPT. It will literally be included in the query.  It's even better as your blog content will be given even more prominence as your domain's content will be given extra preference.  
  
If you are a startup or smaller brand this is going to make appearing in the chats harder.  You are going to have to start being more creative on your content and/or hope the search queries change.
