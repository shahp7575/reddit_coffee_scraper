Day 2: still didn’t need coffee. I could tell my body was tired but my brain wasn’t. Had a massive migraine. Still very hungry but could be my period.

Day 3: feel awake as soon as I get out of bed. Feel agitated over even the smallest thing. Feel like something is off - maybe too much energy for my liking.

1pqm2xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1pqm2xz/my_ex_got_over_me_using_an_app_and_im_still/,My ex got over me using an app... and I'm still heartbroken,"Um so basically I ran into my ex at a local coffee shop at our university. We had been together for 2.5 years and only broke up a month ago (mutually). She was in line waiting to order and I was directly behind her (already awkward Ik). But I knew it would just be flat out rude if I didn't acknowledge her or say hi. So I did. She was actually really polite and even suggested to sit down with her for a few mins to catch up. I had been doing no-contact up until this point so I was quite surprised at the invitation but I agreed to avoid any further awkwardness.

We sat down and to my surprise... she seemed completely normal. As normal as you can expect someone to be when talking with an ex I guess... but it didn't even seem like she looked at me like I was her ex. It was like she was talking to a friend. She was asking me ""So how are you... How are you feeling about exams... you look great"", being unnecessarily polite and I went along with it for a while but it was hard pretending like this wasn't the person who I had been thinking about every night for the last month. I wanted to tell her how broken I was ever since we broke up and how much I missed her. What made me the most upset was she looked completely fine, unfazed almost.

So I told her. It was a moment of weakness, yes. But I told her how messed up the breakup had left me and I hoped she would reciprocate those feelings... but she didn't. She felt sorry for me. It was even more frustrating to have my ex pity me and be in such a good space, mentally after a breakup that I was shattered by. So I took the bait. I asked her, ""How are you so okay? I'm losing sleep, I feel like a shell of myself. I miss you and you seem like you're doing better than ever. How?""

She said it wasn't always easy for her. The first week was hard for her too but apparently one of her friends saw her in her depressed state and recommended an app called Refeel to help her get over me and how it was pretty easy once she started using the app. She said she felt like she was in a much better place now and the app helped her resist the urge to contact me. Out of all the answers she could have given e.g. ""I never really loved you, I love being single, you were weighing me down"", I did not expect her to say an app helped her move on. I was so mad inside, on the verge of tears, I just said I got to go and made up some bs about how I was meeting a friend to study. I couldn't believe how easy it was for her and how I was struggling so much.

And why was it easy? Because she used an app. An APP. This Refeel app allowed her to move on meanwhile I'm suffering from excruciating heartbreak. I don't even know what to do. I didn't even know this was possible. This sounds like such a 21st century Black Mirror type of situation. But if anyone else has experienced this, please let me know. Worst thing is, I'm thinking of downloading the app myself.",1,1766153522.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

This involved swearing and throwing the jug off the fridge in the vicinity of the recycling bin (she missed and just left it on the floor).

I felt there wasnt much left, but I also thought there was another jug in the fridge (my mistake). I immediately ran to the market and grabbed another carton for her.

1pqm1vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1pqm1vb/need_to_crash_out_for_a_second/,need to crash out for a second,"i am 16, i have been directing since i was seven. i first made nature documentaries (eventually became a youtuber when i was 10 and had a semi successful eco podcast at the same age which got me on bbc radio) and other similar stuff. 
when i was 12, i got into adult animation, made my first ever pitch bible and i knew that was the sphere i wanted to be in. 

my first show bible and pilot was for a dystopian, anthology series called abduco. it went through about 8 drafts (i locked myself in a room for 4 hours until i had the first bible done haha) and whilst i was, (and still am honestly!) incredibly proud, i then wrote my second bible a few months later. i would bring my macbook to a coffee shop almost every day and over the course of a week through caramel frappuccino’s and episodes of family guy as background noise, i made progress with a show clearly based off of inside job but with a medical twist. (think riget the kingdom) i was, again very proud of that. my mum says it’s her favourite thing i have made. but i wholeheartedly disagree. 

on the 21st of july 2023, (i remember the date well as it struck me last year that my show, set in the atomic age, and is the reason that i have read eight books about the manhattan project this year, was conceived on the day that the oppenheimer biopic came out. very sad i will never get to make one now!) myself and a friend came up with a project that, at the risk of sounding delusional, if soulmates could be projects, this would be mine. i won’t go into detail but on the day that i came up with the idea, i knew that this would be the project that would be my breakthrough. 
a year later, my co writer ghosted me. i bounced back quickly, she never texted me near the end and all that i had to heal from was unresolved romantic feelings towards her but i’m healing from that. 

that was when i decided to lock in.
i made my first pitch deck draft and then 12 more until i got it right. i made four pilot drafts and directed multiple short films to keep myself on top of directing and keep my skills fresh while i waited for this to get hopefully picked up. when my school did work experience, i waited for 6+ months, asked 30+ companies until i finally got to go to london to do work experience at one of the top media companies in the country. they were insanely complimentary but still no cigar on the pitching side of things. people inside and outside the industry have heavily *complimented* this show but i have never been able to get any real connections. 

since then, i have been cold pitching, cold pitching and cold pitching. i use linkedin, google and imdb pro but seldom hear back. i get it, i really do but it’s so upsetting. i’m more passionate about this than i am about anything else in the world, i have worked on it full time for almost three years and if i had one wish, it would be for this show to get picked up. it has piloted me through tough times in my life, given me purpose and something to (hopefully) look forward to. i am just very worried that i am getting nowhere with this. i wanted to hire a mentor but they are too expensive. where do i go from here? i work my ass off every day to try and get this project off the ground but i am just worried that i’m doing something very wrong and it will never come to fruition.

1pqm1oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForteFoundation/comments/1pqm1oz/what_should_i_be_focusing_on_to_advance_my_mba/,What should I be focusing on to advance my MBA journey right now?,"Dear Reader,

December is here — inboxes are quieting, offices are slowing down, and for the first time in months, even your business-school-bound friends are choosing peppermint mochas over LinkedIn posts. The MBA process can feel stressful at this time of year … but whether you're gearing up for R2, deciding on R1, studying for the test, or planning for next year, the holidays are your chance to reset, recalibrate, and breathe.

Here’s your MBA holiday survival guide:

🎄 **1: Accept the Slowdown:** Admissions offices? Closed. Coffee chats? On ice until January. In other words: you’re not falling behind — the entire MBA universe is taking a nap. This is the month where rest is not only allowed… it’s productive.

✨ **2: Prioritize Self-Care Before You Prioritize Strategy:** You can’t write strong essays, make clear decisions, or study effectively from a state of exhaustion. So before we talk tactics, let’s talk you. Self-care ideas that actually support your MBA goals:

* Journaling to clarify goals (and stop spiraling)
* A real sleep routine (because cortisol is not your friend)
* A weekly reset walk without your phone
* A break from MBA YouTube, chats, forums — yes, even Reddit (temporarily!)

🕰️ **For R1 Applicants — Find Your Next Steps:** 

* If you’ve been admitted – Congratulations! Still deciding where to go? We suggest prospective students create a matrix in Excel that ranks location, alumni network, concentration opportunities, company connections, etc. and weighs these aspects based on how important they are to you. This will create a number rating for each school, which gives you something to gut check against. It also helps you think through what actually matters the most to you in the decision-making process. 
* If you are considering scholarship negotiations, look for a reconsideration form in the portal or contact your designated admissions officer to inquire about the process. They should provide you with a link where you can talk about any notable progress you have made since you applied – like a promotion, new responsibilities, new volunteer/leadership opportunity, etc. – and it will also ask you to list your other offers. 
* If you are on the waitlist or facing rejection notifications, check out [our last Power Move column](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForteFoundation/comments/1pkuckt/i_got_the_mba_waitlist_email_help/).

🎯 **For Round 2 Applicants — Focus on Clarity Over Chaos**:   
Holiday distractions are everywhere, which means your strength is in structure:

* Finalize your recommenders and timelines
* Refine your “why MBA” and “why now” until it feels unmistakably yours
* Draft essays early, edit lightly, and protect your peace

📚 **For Test Takers — Think Maintenance, Not Mastery:**   
December is not the month to grind eight-hour study days. It is the month to maintain:

* Short, consistent sessions
* Strengthen weak foundations
* Schedule your exam for January or February when mental bandwidth rebounds

🌱 **For Next Year's Applicants — Build Early Momentum:**   
This is a great time to:

* Explore what genuinely excites you about an MBA
* Skim blogs, listen to student podcasts, explore clubs
* Identify 3–5 experiences or gaps you want to address next year
* Start mapping a simple 3-month (Jan–March) and 6-month (Jan–June) plan for what you need to accomplish to apply during your desired window

The end of the year isn’t about hustling harder — it’s about recalibrating your mind, your goals, and your confidence. If you have a question you’d like The Power Move to feature next week, drop it in the comments or DM us (confidentially, always).

1pqm19z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1pqm19z/aita_for_wanting_alone_time_with_my_girlfriend/,AITA for wanting alone time with my girlfriend when visiting her parents?,"I’m currently visiting my girlfriend’s parents with her. They live far away, so every visit lasts several days. I’ll be honest: I don’t like her parents because they speak very badly about her, but I still try my best to be the “dream boyfriend” and get along with them, because it’s important to my girlfriend.

The problem is that staying there for days straight is really draining for me. I’ve asked if we could, for example, every second or third day go out somewhere together (coffee, food, a walk, anything) to spend some one-on-one time, since that’s basically impossible at her parents’ house.

She always agrees at first, but when the time comes, she cancels. This happens repeatedly, usually with the reason “I’m too tired,” sometimes for several days in a row. I’ve told her I understand being tired and I’m fine postponing to the next day, but when plans get postponed two or three times, I feel it’s reasonable to expect some compromise and actually go out, even if she’s not feeling 100%.

She says I’m not listening to her feelings, but I feel like wanting private time with my partner as an adult is completely normal. Especially when I’m already pushing my own limits for her sake.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1pqlv45,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1pqlv45/the_verb_poner_all_essential_uses_and_meanings_in/,The Verb Poner: All Essential Uses and Meanings in Spanish,"Poner is a very common and universal verb in the Spanish language. Below, I have described all its main uses and meanings, some of which learners often overlook, that will help you sound more natural, understand native speakers better, and avoid typical mistakes in everyday conversations.

1. PONER: The General ""Put""

The basic meaning is to place an object somewhere. While you might hear meter when putting something inside a bag, drawer, or other enclosed space, “poner” is the standard, all-purpose choice for placing things in a location.

Poner in context:

* Pon las llaves sobre la mesa. → Put the keys on the table.
* ¿Dónde has puesto el mando de la tele? → Where did you put the TV remote?
* He puesto la leche en la nevera. → I’ve put the milk in the fridge. (Note: Here ""meter"" is also common because it's inside, but ""poner"" is perfectly natural).

2 . PONER = to put on / start / get ready (devices, appliances, plans)

Use poner when you start something or get something ready, especially with TV/music/appliances and preparations.

Poner la mesa → To set the table.

* ¿Puedes poner la mesa para cenar? (Can you set the table for dinner?)

Poner la tele / la lavadora / música → To turn on/start (appliances or media).

* Voy a poner una lavadora. (I’m going to put on a load of laundry.)
* No pongas la tele todavía. (Don’t turn on the TV yet.)

3 . Additional uses of PONER in daily life: 

3 .1  In a bar/café: PONER = to get/serve

* ¿Me pones un café? → Can you get me a coffee?
* Ponme una cerveza, por favor. → Can you get me a beer, please?

3.2  PONER una multa = to give someone a fine

* Me pusieron una multa por exceso de velocidad. → I got a speeding ticket.

3.3  PONER atención = to pay attention

* Pon atención a lo que digo. → Pay attention to what I’m saying.  

The verb 'poner' also has a form with 'se' (**ponerse**) in Spanish, which we’ll move on to now.

4 . PONERSE = to put on (clothing)

Use ponerse + clothing/accessory to talk about putting something on your body (getting dressed, shoes, jacket, glasses, etc.).

* Hace frío, ponte el abrigo. → It’s cold, put on your coat.
* Me estoy poniendo los zapatos. → I am putting on my shoes.

5 . PONERSE = to become / get (change of state)

Use ponerse + adjective to express a temporary change in mood, health, or appearance (how you “get” in the moment).

* Se puso rojo de vergüenza. → He/She blushed / turned red from embarrassment.
* Me puse enfermo el fin de semana. → I got sick over the weekend.
* Me pongo nervioso/triste/contento con facilidad. → I get nervous/sad/happy easily.

6 . PONERSE A + Infinitivo = To Start Doing

This structure is used to show that someone suddenly or decisively starts an action.

In context:

* Cuando escuchó la canción, se puso a bailar. → When he heard the song, he started dancing.
* Se puso a llover de repente. → It started to rain suddenly.

7 . Idioms and fixed expressions:

Around 30 shots later I could not manage to get a drinkable espresso (except the one I firced myself to drink as a cappuchino).

The shots seem to always be sour, no matter what I do.

4 different bags of coffee:
- Chicco d'Oro
- Cheap specialty coffee from the supermarket (smellt sour from the point of opening the bag)
- Kimbo Autogrill
- La Semeuse Mocca

The espresso I try to get out is a chocolatty, nutty one. I am allergic to sour taste in coffee.
Rather a bit on the bitter side.

What I tried:
- Decreasing grind size to the point the machine can't push through liquid until it creates channels
- Increasing grind size (only a few clicks until it starts flowing too quickly from the get go)
- Increased boiler pressure from 0.8 bar to around 1.2 bar (at max)
First tap water, then distilled with added magnesium and sodium bic.

I always aim at 18g in, 36g out in 25-35 seconds (tried all over this range). Double basket, unpressurized. 

What options do I have left?

1pqlm4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pqlm4f/internal_tremor/,Internal Tremor,"Hi everyone,
I wanted to share what I’ve been going through and see if anyone has experienced something similar.

About two weeks ago, I woke up, ate some food, and suddenly felt very unwell — shortness of breath, heart racing, weakness, and extreme fatigue. For about a week after that, I would get random episodes where I felt overwhelmed, lightheaded, and my heart would start pounding out of nowhere.

One day after having a coffee, my heart rate jumped to 125 bpm and I genuinely felt like I was having a heart attack. I went to the ER and had blood work, a chest X-ray, and an EKG — everything came back normal. The doctor told me my heart is very healthy (I’m active) and suggested I use a mobile EKG tracker. I’ve been using it for about 10 days now and all readings have been normal. Doctor said he doesn't know what it could be. 

During these episodes, my blood pressure spikes, but then it drops back down shortly after. Now, two weeks later, my heart rate doesn’t shoot up anymore, but I’m left with this constant trembling feeling — mainly in my chest and jaw. If I clench my teeth, I can actually hear them clicking, like when you’re cold. It feels like my nervous system is shaking internally. It improves at times, but it’s almost always there.

I’ll be honest — the last few months have been extremely stressful. I’ve been moving countries, changing jobs, and I’m also expecting a baby, so it’s been a lot emotionally and mentally.

I’ve been trying to take care of myself and currently take magnesium, iron, and B1. My biggest fear is this lingering trembling lasting for months or even years.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has recommendations that helped them, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.

1pqlm4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Prize-Drive1781/comments/1pqlm4c/stop_overpaying_for_coffee_5_quick_hacks_to_get/,Stop Overpaying for Coffee: 5 Quick Hacks to Get Premium Specialty Coffee at Home for Less,"

☕ Stop throwing money away on overpriced coffee! Your morning cup shouldn't cost more than your lunch. 

Premium specialty coffee at home? Totally doable. Without breaking the bank.

Most coffee lovers spend $5-7 per day at cafés. That's $150+ monthly. For one person.

The math is brutal. But fixable.

## Why Premium Coffee Costs So Much (And How to Beat the System)

Specialty coffee shops markup beans 300-400%. Location costs. Labor. Equipment maintenance.

You're paying for the experience. Not just the coffee.

Home brewing changes everything.

Same quality beans. Fraction of the cost. Total control over flavor.

## Hack #1: Master the Bulk Buying Game

🎯 Buy smart, not frequent.

### The 2-Week Rule

Purchase coffee every 2 weeks instead of weekly. Savings: 15-20% instantly.

### Wholesale Options

* Local roaster bulk deals
* Online specialty retailers
* Coffee subscription services
* Warehouse club memberships

Pro tip: Fresh-roasted beans stay optimal for 2-4 weeks. Buy accordingly.

### Storage Secrets

* Airtight containers only
* Cool, dark locations
* Never refrigerate whole beans
* Grind immediately before brewing

## Hack #2: Nail Your Grind Game

⚡ Wrong grind = wasted money.

Pre-ground coffee loses flavor within hours. You're literally pouring money down the drain.

### Burr Grinder Investment

Cost: $50-150. Payback time: 2-3 months.

Why burr grinders win:

* Consistent particle size
* Better extraction
* No heat damage
* Longer bean freshness

### Grind Size Chart

* Coarse: French press, cold brew
* Medium: Drip coffee makers
* Fine: Espresso, Aeropress
* Extra fine: Turkish coffee

Match your grind to your method. Period.



## Hack #3: Optimize Your Brewing Equipment

🔧 Your brewer makes or breaks your budget.

Expensive equipment ≠ better coffee. Smart equipment = better coffee.

### Budget Champions

* Pour-over setups: $20-40 total investment
* French press: $25-50, lasts years
* Aeropress: $40, virtually indestructible
* Moka pot: $30, Italian excellence

### Maintenance = Money Saved

* Clean equipment weekly
* Replace filters regularly
* Descale monthly
* Check seals and gaskets

Broken equipment wastes beans. Good maintenance protects your investment.

### Water Quality Matters

Use filtered water. Tap water minerals ruin flavor and damage equipment.

Cost: $0.10 per gallon vs. $2+ per bottle.

## Hack #4: Explore Coffee Duke's Variety Packs

💎 Over 60 varieties. Free shipping. Game changer.

[Coffee Duke](https://coffeeduke.com) removes the guesswork from specialty coffee shopping.

### Why Variety Packs Win

* Try multiple flavors without commitment
* Discover personal preferences faster
* Avoid expensive mistakes
* Built-in cost savings

Featured options:

* [Chocolate Hazelnut](https://coffeeduke.com/products/chocolate-hazelnut): Rich, indulgent, perfect for afternoon breaks
* [Mexican Chocolate](https://coffeeduke.com/products/mexican-chocolate): Spiced complexity without café pricing
* [Pecan Pie](https://coffeeduke.com/products/pecan-pie): Dessert coffee that replaces expensive treats

### Free Shipping Advantage

No minimum orders. No membership fees. No hidden costs.

Calculate the savings:

* Local café: $6 per specialty drink
* Coffee Duke equivalent: $1.50 per cup
* Monthly savings: $135+ for daily drinkers



## Hack #5: Single-Serve Pod Strategy

🎯 Use pods strategically, not exclusively.

Single-serve pods cost 3x more per cup than whole beans. But they have their place.

### Smart Pod Usage

* Busy mornings only
* Travel situations
* Office convenience
* Guest preferences

### Pod Cost Reduction

* Buy in bulk during sales
* Generic brand alternatives
* Refillable pod systems
* Mix with traditional brewing

The 80/20 rule: 80% whole bean brewing, 20% pod convenience.

### Quality Pod Selection

Look for:

* Freshness dates
* Origin information
* Roast level clarity
* Recyclable materials

## The Real Cost Breakdown

### Daily Café Habit

* Specialty drink: $6.00
* Monthly total: $180
* Annual cost: $2,160

### Home Brewing Setup

* Initial equipment: $150
* Monthly beans: $45
* Annual cost: $690

Annual savings: $1,470

That's vacation money. Car payment money. Investment money.



## Quick Implementation Guide

### Week 1: Equipment Setup

* Buy burr grinder
* Choose brewing method
* Set up storage system

### Week 2: Bean Sourcing

* Research local roasters
* Order Coffee Duke variety pack
* Establish buying schedule

### Week 3: Technique Refinement

* Perfect grind settings
* Dial in water temperature
* Time your brewing process

### Week 4: Cost Tracking

* Calculate daily savings
* Adjust buying patterns
* Plan next month's orders

## Advanced Money-Saving Moves

### Seasonal Buying

Coffee prices fluctuate seasonally. Buy during harvest seasons for maximum savings.

### Direct Roaster Relationships

Build relationships with local roasters. Ask about day-old discounts and bulk pricing.

### Coffee Community Connections

Join local coffee groups. Share bulk orders. Exchange brewing tips.

Network your way to savings.

## Common Expensive Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Don't buy pre-ground coffee  
❌ Don't ignore water quality  
❌ Don't over-complicate brewing  
❌ Don't buy tiny quantities frequently  
❌ Don't ignore equipment maintenance



## Your Next Steps

They have two kids (5 and 2). Over the last year my brother has gotten… weird. Mood swings, random anger over tiny stuff, disappearing for hours, then acting like we’re all being dramatic. He also dropped like 20 lbs and started doing that jaw-clench thing constantly. My parents keep saying it’s stress and that he’s ""just tired"", and they get mad if anyone pushes it.

Last weekend we had a family dinner at my parents’ house. I went to grab coffee from the kitchen and noticed my brother hovering around the counter like he was guarding it. When he stepped outside to ""take a call"", I opened the coffee tin because it felt off. Inside the tin was a small baggie with white powder tucked under the scoop. I froze. I put it back exactly how it was and my hands were literally shaking. I know I should’ve confronted him right there but I didn’t want a blowup in front of the kids. Later I pulled my mom aside and told her what I saw. She went pale, then said, ""We can handle this as a family. Do NOT tell Mia. You’ll ruin everything."" My dad basically said the same thing, like it’s a PR problem.

That night I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about the kids, and Mia driving with him, and what if he’s nodding off or something. The next morning I called Mia and told her straight: I found a baggie in the coffee tin and I’m pretty sure he’s using. She went silent for a long time and then said ""Thank you for telling me"" but sounded like she was trying not to cry. Later my brother blew up my phone, screaming that I’m a snitch, that I’m trying to destroy his marriage, that it was ""not even his"" and I’m insane. My parents are also furious and told me I crossed a line, that I should have let them talk to him first.

It’s daytime here, nothing special going on. I was just cleaning the kitchen earlier, coffee getting cold ☕️, brain on autopilot… and then I kinda stopped.

Stared out the window for a bit. Listened. Felt weirdly grounded 🌿  
No big thoughts, no meaning to chase. Just that quiet feeling behind the ribs.

Baba Yaga popped into my head (idk why) not in a spooky way, more like that *in-between* energy. Between tasks. Between thoughts. Not performing, not explaining, just existing.

It made me realize how rare that is during the day. I’m usually rushing, overthinking, trying to be “on.” This was different. Small, ordinary, but real ✨

Anyway, felt right to drop it here instead of overanalyzing.

So my bf is Spanish and he tells me about his experience with work culture in Spain, and I just want to know if others have had similar experiences or if this is more specific to him / his workplace.

He mentioned that socializing often involves drinking — like starting the morning with a coffee (sometimes coffee with alcohol), then having a smaller break before lunch where people might also drink, then lunch. He also said there’s kind of an unspoken rule that you don’t leave before your boss, so people might still be around having beers during breaks.

After you finally leave, the night often continues and people might stay out drinking and get home around 1–2am. He said this is the case for a lot of the people he works with and almost every night.

I’m just a bit confused how people have the energy to work the next day or time to workout  if they’re out that late after working all day, and how this fits with family life or relationships — especially if weekends are also social.

I totally understand grabbing drinks after work, and staying to chat. I’m just genuinely curious how common this actually is and whether others relate to it or if it really depends on the job / city / age.

Flavor has been more consistent with less bitterness and sourness and really just tastes like coffee/what I’m used to as espresso

Has this happened to anyone else?,"Um so basically I ran into my ex at a local coffee shop in our neighbourhood. We never moved in together because of how close we lived. We had been together for 2.5 years and only broke up a month ago (mutually). She was in line waiting to order and I was directly behind her (already awkward Ik). But I knew it would just be flat out rude if I didn't acknowledge her or say hi. So I did. She was actually really polite and even suggested to sit down with her for a few mins to catch up. I had been doing no-contact up until this point so I was quite surprised at the invitation but I agreed to avoid any further awkwardness.

We sat down and to my surprise... she seemed completely normal. As normal as you can expect someone to be when talking with an ex I guess... but it didn't even seem like she looked at me like I was her ex. It was like she was talking to a friend. She was asking me ""So how are you... How are you feeling about exams... you look great"", being unnecessarily polite and I went along with it for a while but it was hard pretending like this wasn't the person who I had been thinking about every night for the last month. I wanted to tell her how broken I was ever since we broke up and how much I missed her. What made me the most upset was she looked completely fine, unfazed almost.

So I told her. It was a moment of weakness, yes. But I told her how messed up the breakup had left me and I hoped she would reciprocate those feelings... but she didn't. She felt sorry for me. It was even more frustrating to have my ex pity me and be in such a good space, mentally after a breakup that I was shattered by. So I took the bait. I asked her, ""How are you so okay? I'm losing sleep, I feel like a shell of myself. I miss you and you seem like you're doing better than ever. How?""

She said it wasn't always easy for her. The first week was hard for her too but apparently one of her friends saw her in her depressed state and recommended an app called Refeel to help her get over me and how it was pretty easy once she started using the app. She said she felt like she was in a much better place now and the app helped her resist the urge to contact me. Out of all the answers she could have given e.g. ""I never really loved you, I love being single, you were weighing me down"", I did not expect her to say an app helped her move on. I was so mad inside, on the verge of tears, I just said I got to go and made up some bs about how I was meeting a friend to study. I couldn't believe how easy it was for her and how I was struggling so much.

And why was it easy? Because she used an app. An APP. This Refeel app allowed her to move on meanwhile I'm suffering from excruciating heartbreak. I don't even know what to do. I didn't even know this was possible. This sounds like such a 21st century Black Mirror type of situation. But if anyone else has experienced this, please let me know. Worst thing is, I'm thinking of downloading the app myself.",0,1766152038.0,BreakUps30Plus,0,0.5,False

Pressed. Clean. Untouched. I’ve met people like this. They're the kind that say “containment breach” like it’s a coffee order. I doubt he even *saw* her. Not really. Just another box to check. Another rotting room on the clipboard.

But she *saw* him. **And the woods saw him back.**

I think this was the first time she admits memory itself is changing shape. Names shifting in her ledger. Words disappearing. “*Daughter of Veles*” feels… like a warning. Or a title. The ledger might be obeying some force deeper than decay—something mythic, something ancient that resents being catalogued.

Anyway, here's the next entry:

***""The Red Forest Diaries""***

*""The 11th of May, in the Year of our Lord 1986*

*Hidden beneath the third floorboard in the maintenance shed. If found, do not read aloud. The pages hum when disturbed.*

*They sent a man in today. Said he was with the government. Said it like a priest says sacrament, but his voice lacked reverence—only the dry, practiced cadence of someone used to not being believed. His boots were too clean. Too polished. Not even the road dust clung to them. His coat was pressed tight to his frame, seams stiff as if just unwrapped. No ash under his nails. No calluses. No grief.*

*He did not belong here.*

*He asked me how many I’ve buried. I told him fifty-three. He asked for their names. I told him I only write down the ones I see in dreams. He blinked once, then shut his notebook. After that, he stopped speaking to me.*

*I am grateful.*

*His presence soured the air. His eyes were not the kind that softened at tragedy. Not the kind that held space for pain. They were unfeeling. Bureaucratic. I have seen gentler gazes in the mouths of wolves. He stared too long at the perimeter of the woods. As if it watched him back. I hope it did.*

*The other workers didn’t speak much while he was here. Some pretended not to see him. Others stood straighter, wore cleaner masks. As if shame were contagious and order could save them. It cannot. Not anymore.*

*There are things I cannot name anymore. Words that vanish from the page once spoken aloud. Names that shift in my ledger when I close the book. One name rewrote itself this morning—first as Anastasia Okhlopkova, then as Nothing But Smoke. I opened the page again, and it said Daughter of Veles. I did not question it.*

*Some days, I forget the alphabet. Not in whole. Just certain letters. The ones used to spell hope. Or mother. Or home.*

*Murn has taken to lingering near me more often. At dawn, I found him waiting by the riverbank, fur matted with dark blood. Not his. The wound did not belong to him. A fresh kill, perhaps, or the remnants of something left too long in the open. He did not eat. He only watched the water, nose twitching at the mist. When I approached, he did not growl. I lay down beside him, back pressed to the ridges of his ribs. They rise like the arches of a ruined cathedral—sharp, beautiful, broken.*

*His warmth was not clean. It was blood-warm. Carrion-warm. The kind of warmth that clings to butchered things, or old radiators in collapsed buildings. And yet, I felt safe. Held. As though he had accepted my sickness, or recognized it in himself.*

*I treasure him in secret.*

*Not aloud. Not in front of the others. Not even in prayer.*

*But when I lay with him beneath the veil of grey sky, when my fingers knot into the thick of his fur, when his breathing steadies mine—*

*I think perhaps we are the same.*

*Not alive.*

*Not dead.*

*Just remembering.*

*And being remembered.""*

The letters vanishing from her mind? “The ones used to spell *hope*. Or *mother*. Or *home*.” That line felt like a blade. Like losing language is the next stage of being... unmade.

Then there’s **Murn**.

I’ve been trying to track his appearances—he’s not just a dog. I don’t think he ever was. Not in the ordinary sense. The way she describes his ribcage, his warmth, the blood that isn’t his… he feels like a revenant. A guide. Something born of the in-between. Or made by it.

And her lying down beside him—*cathedral of ribs*, *carrion-warmth*—Gods, it’s beautiful and horrifying. This is her prayer now. This is her chapel.

The final lines stopped me cold:   
*""Not alive. Not dead. Just remembering. And being remembered.""*

That’s the line I keep whispering to myself, without knowing why. 

If she’s right… and the ledger writes itself now… then who’s writing *me*?

Kinda gross but I’ll have one BM in the morning and it feels stuck or unfinished but nothing else can come out despite the “fullness” backed up feeling. Then a few hours later an urgent feeling to go again and i have to run to the bathroom yet it feels incomplete still. Then i finally get the last urge at the end of the day or if ive really maxed out on coffee lmao then try to get it all out again. It reminds me of like squeezing out of a toothpaste tube but you can’t get it out.

Then rinse and repeat a couple days later. I’m both constipated and not, like the consistency seems closer to loose stools but the feeling is very constipated and sometimes it takes 2 or 3 days to get a bowel movement again. 

Does anyone know why SIBO causes this (or if it’s a side effect from one of the root causes) and how to repair it ? ",1,1766151963.0,SIBO,1,1.0,False
1pqlhcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1pqlhcy/f4m_psychological_thriller_there_is_someone/,[F4M] Psychological Thriller - There is someone living in the walls. Can our marriage survive?,"I’m looking for a long-term, plot-heavy psychological horror roleplay rooted entirely in realism. This is not supernatural horror. Nothing is possessed, cursed, or paranormal. The fear comes from exhaustion, grief, misinterpretation, and the slow, devastating consequences of not being believed.

This is a story about how love can survive for a long time — and still not be enough.

Arthur and Evie Strong have been married for six months.

Arthur is in his late 50s — British, gentle, thoughtful, and deeply principled. An English language professor who once, decades ago, wrote a trashy vampire romance novel in his twenties. It was meant to be disposable. It wasn’t. It became a cult hit with teenagers, and he’s never quite escaped it. He’s embarrassed by it now. He hasn’t thought about it in years.

Evie is in her early 30s — Moldovan, practical, sharp-eyed, and emotionally guarded in the way people who grew up without safety often are. She worked campus security when a group of students dragged her into Arthur’s lecture on Pride and Prejudice. It was the first book she ever read in English. She stayed afterward. Asked questions. Too many questions. They got coffee. Then another. Then dates — encouraged relentlessly by his students. A year later, they were married.

Evie has two toddlers from a previous relationship:

James (3) — quiet, watchful, unusually observant for his age. He listens more than he speaks. He notices when adults are lying.

Lily (almost 2) — loud, fearless, affectionate, still stumbling through the world with absolute confidence. She cries loudly. She laughs loudly. She sleeps badly.

They buy a house — older, larger, full of poor renovations and strange structural quirks — because they’re talking seriously about having a baby together. A future. Stability. Room to grow.

At the same time, Evie’s younger sister dies suddenly. No warning. No answers. Evie begins to unravel quietly. Her doctors prescribe antidepressants to help her cope. She takes them because she wants to be better — for Arthur, for the children, for the family they’re building.

Arthur is recognised outside the new house by fans of his old novel. They take photos. Ask questions. Post them online. It feels harmless. Slightly embarrassing. Easy to laugh off.

Four days after moving in, Evie wakes from a vivid, terrifying nightmare.

She tells Arthur someone was watching her while she slept.

Arthur responds the way a loving, rational husband would. He comforts her. Kisses her cheek. Blames stress, grief, medication side effects. He stays calm. Logical. Grounded. Evie believes him — because she needs to believe him.

That’s how it starts.

Over the next year, Evie deteriorates.

She is hospitalised. Placed on psych holds. Assessed repeatedly for schizophrenia and mood disorders. Each professional interaction chips away at her confidence. She begins doubting her own memory. Her perceptions. Her instincts.

At the same time, life goes on.

Food goes missing. Laundry disappears. The house never quite feels clean no matter how much she scrubs. The children talk about someone being awake at night. Someone who sits quietly. Someone who promises to “help” if mummy gets sick again.

Doctors call it shared delusion. Stress. Trauma response.

Arthur believes them — not because he doesn’t love his wife, but because believing she is ill feels safer than believing something else is wrong. And because he is trying desperately to keep their marriage intact.

They go to therapy.
They schedule date nights.
They hold hands in hospital waiting rooms.
They promise each other this is temporary.

Arthur reassures her constantly. Evie clings to him even as she starts to resent the reassurance. Love and frustration begin to exist side by side. They argue quietly so the children won’t hear. They apologise constantly. They are still in love — and they are both exhausted.

No one ever checks the crawl space behind the wardrobe’s access panel.

No one ever considers neglect, intrusion, or human error.

Until one evening, Evie asks Arthur — not accusing, not hysterical, just tired:

“If I disappear… will you believe someone hurt me? Or will you think I finally lost my mind and ran?”

That question breaks him.

Arthur goes to the police not because he understands what’s happening — but because he’s terrified of losing her, and because love finally outweighs logic.

What the investigation uncovers will determine not just whether Evie survives — but whether their marriage does.

Has this happened to anyone else?,"Um so basically I ran into my ex at a local coffee shop at our university. We had been together for 2.5 years and only broke up a month ago (mutually). She was in line waiting to order and I was directly behind her (already awkward Ik). But I knew it would just be flat out rude if I didn't acknowledge her or say hi. So I did. She was actually really polite and even suggested to sit down with her for a few mins to catch up. I had been doing no-contact up until this point so I was quite surprised at the invitation but I agreed to avoid any further awkwardness.

We sat down and to my surprise... she seemed completely normal. As normal as you can expect someone to be when talking with an ex I guess... but it didn't even seem like she looked at me like I was her ex. It was like she was talking to a friend. She was asking me ""So how are you... How are you feeling about exams... you look great"", being unnecessarily polite and I went along with it for a while but it was hard pretending like this wasn't the person who I had been thinking about every night for the last month. I wanted to tell her how broken I was ever since we broke up and how much I missed her. What made me the most upset was she looked completely fine, unfazed almost.

So I told her. It was a moment of weakness, yes. But I told her how messed up the breakup had left me and I hoped she would reciprocate those feelings... but she didn't. She felt sorry for me. It was even more frustrating to have my ex pity me and be in such a good space, mentally after a breakup that I was shattered by. So I took the bait. I asked her, ""How are you so okay? I'm losing sleep, I feel like a shell of myself. I miss you and you seem like you're doing better than ever. How?""

She said it wasn't always easy for her. The first week was hard for her too but apparently one of her friends saw her in her depressed state and recommended an app called Refeel to help her get over me and how it was pretty easy once she started using the app. She said she felt like she was in a much better place now and the app helped her resist the urge to contact me.

I was so mad inside, on the verge of tears, I just said I got to go and made up some bs about how I was meeting a friend to study. I couldn't believe how easy it was for her and how I was struggling so much.

And why was it easy? Because she used an app. An APP. This Refeel app allowed her to move on meanwhile I'm suffering from excruciating heartbreak. I don't even know what to do.

1pql7xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Summer_15000122145/comments/1pql7xv/the_relationship_between_droplet_positioning/,The Relationship Between Droplet Positioning Accuracy and Print Quality in Digital Inkjet Systems,"# Relationship Between Ink Droplet Placement Accuracy and Print Quality

In digital inkjet systems, the accuracy of droplet placement directly affects pattern clarity, color uniformity, and device performance. When placement accuracy requirements are better than 15 μm (corresponding to angular deviation ≤ 15 mrad) for multi‑pass applications and better than 5 μm (angular deviation ≤ 5 mrad) for single‑pass applications, the following dimensions must be analyzed:

# 1. Cumulative Effect of Mechanical Positioning Errors

* Platform Motion Accuracy: High‑resolution printing (e.g., above 200 ppi) requires mechanical stage displacement errors to be controlled within ±10 μm; otherwise, error accumulation during multi‑drop superposition can cause pixel misalignment or edge blurring.
* Printhead Angular Deviation: If the droplet ejection angle deviates by more than 5 mrad, a 5 μm placement error will occur at a 1 mm throw distance. This directly affects the filling uniformity of sub‑pixels (55–85 μm), leading to color distortion or luminance non‑uniformity.

# 2. Interactive Effects of Droplet Dynamic Behavior

* Wetting Control and Coffee‑Ring Effect: Even with precise placement, droplet spreading on the substrate is influenced by surface energy, ink viscosity, etc. Angular deviation may cause asymmetric spreading, aggravating the coffee‑ring effect and reducing film uniformity.
* Tolerance for Multi‑Drop Overlap: A single‑drop deviation of 5 μm may seem small, but in high‑density printing (e.g., tens of thousands of drops per cm²), accumulated deviations can cause the overlap ratio between adjacent droplets to exceed the design threshold, resulting in uneven film thickness or functional‑layer defects.

# 3. System‑Level Accuracy Calibration Strategies

* Dynamic Compensation Technology: Real‑time monitoring of printhead attitude (e.g., infrared calibration) and stage position (e.g., grating encoder feedback) can correct instantaneous deviations caused by mechanical vibration or thermal deformation, stabilizing angular deviation within 5 mrad.
* Ink Formulation Optimization: Low‑surface‑tension ink can reduce trajectory drift during flight, while high‑boiling‑point solvents slow down drying, allowing droplets to slightly adjust position on the substrate, indirectly improving effective placement accuracy.

# Conclusion: Precision Boundaries and Process Trade‑offs

  
Droplet placement accuracy must be co‑optimized with printhead physical parameters (e.g., droplet volume on the order of 10 pL) and substrate characteristics (e.g., hydrophobic patterning). For micron‑scale devices such as OLEDs, a 5 μm deviation may require redundant design (e.g., compensation zones at pixel edges); whereas for applications like advertisement printing, 15 μm accuracy combined with color‑management algorithms can already meet visual requirements.

  
  


# Mechanism of Aerodynamic Effects on Ink Droplet Landing Position



# 1. Slipstream Interference

* Phenomenon: The longitudinal airflow (slipstream) generated during printhead movement alters the initial velocity vector of droplets, causing the actual landing point to deviate from the theoretical position.
* Case Example: In high‑speed printing, slipstream can cause droplets to lag or surge forward, resulting in ghosting or trailing effects.
* Key Parameters: Ratio of printhead speed to droplet mass and slipstream velocity.

# 2. Crossflow Disturbance

* Cause: Ambient airflow (e.g., from ventilation equipment) or internal cooling airflow acts laterally on droplets, inducing sideways displacement.
* Impact: In wide‑format printing, crossflow can lead to uneven spacing of droplets within the same row, disrupting image continuity.
* Mitigation Measures: Installation of airflow baffles or optimization of printhead chamber sealing.

# 3. Turbulence Effects

* Complexity: Random vortices make droplet trajectories unpredictable, especially in multi‑printhead operations where superimposed turbulence amplifies positional errors.
* Typical Manifestation: When printing light‑colored areas, turbulence may cause uneven droplet dispersion, forming cloud‑like blotches.
* Solution: Optimize printhead array layout via CFD simulation to reduce turbulence generation.

# Systematic Optimization Strategies

* Active Compensation Technology: Dynamically adjust droplet ejection timing and angle based on real‑time airflow sensor data.
* Environmental Control: Maintain constant temperature and humidity within an enclosed printing chamber to minimize external airflow interference.
* Ink Improvement: Increase ink viscosity to enhance droplet resistance to interference, while ensuring compatibility with nozzles.

# Future Research Directions



# It is recommended to explore the design of micro‑airflow guiding structures to reduce turbulence intensity near the printhead through directed airflow, along with developing adaptive aerodynamic compensation algorithms to respond to dynamic environmental changes.

Nothing serious, just that “always slightly run down” feeling. I wasn’t sleeping badly, but I was relying way too much on coffee and quick snacks. I didn’t want supplements or a full cleanse — I just wanted something simple I could add without overthinking it.

That’s how I ended up testing the idea behind **9 Powerful Healthy Juices for Immunity, Detox & All-Day Energy**.

I didn’t do a juice fast or replace meals. I just added one fresh juice a day, usually in the morning or early afternoon, and kept everything else normal. The first thing I noticed wasn’t energy — it was digestion. My stomach felt calmer, and that heavy, bloated feeling I usually had by evening started showing up less often.

After a few days, the energy part kicked in. Not the jittery kind like coffee, but more stable. That’s when **9 Powerful Healthy Juices for Immunity, Detox & All-Day Energy** started to make sense to me — it’s less about “detoxing” and more about actually getting nutrients consistently.

Here’s what worked best for me:

* Juices with more vegetables than fruit
* Drinking them earlier in the day
* Sipping slowly instead of chugging
* Treating juice as an addition, not a replacement

I also learned what *didn’t* work. Too much fruit turned it into sugar overload, and I’d feel hungry an hour later. Once I focused on balanced blends (greens, citrus, ginger, beet, carrot), the **9 Powerful Healthy Juices for Immunity, Detox & All-Day Energy** approach felt supportive instead of spiky.

I followed this guide on [**9 Powerful Healthy Juices for Immunity, Detox & All-Day Energy**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/9-healthy-juices-immunity-detox-energy/) because it explains why each juice helps — immunity, digestion, or energy — instead of treating them all the same. That helped me choose based on how I felt that day.

Do I think juices alone make you immune to everything? No. But adding one of the **9 Powerful Healthy Juices for Immunity, Detox & All-Day Energy** regularly made me feel more resilient, less sluggish, and more motivated to eat better overall. That ripple effect mattered more than I expected.

Now I keep 2–3 juice recipes in rotation and use them when I feel run down instead of reaching for more caffeine.

Curious — have you noticed real benefits from adding fresh juices to your routine, or do you feel whole fruits and veggies do the same job for you?

Too many promises, too many “miracle” claims, and usually not much change in how I actually feel. Still, I kept noticing that when I hydrated better and simplified what I drank, my digestion and energy improved. So instead of doing a cleanse, I tried rotating through the **Top 10 Detox Drinks That Actually Support Your Body** and treated it like an experiment.

I didn’t replace meals. I didn’t fast. I just swapped a couple of daily drinks—usually morning and mid-afternoon—and paid attention to patterns. What surprised me most wasn’t weight loss or anything dramatic. It was *consistency*. Having structure made it easier to drink enough fluids without thinking about it all day.

A few things stood out quickly with the **Top 10 Detox Drinks That Actually Support Your Body** approach:

* Drinking earlier in the day helped more than late at night
* Lower-sugar options kept cravings calmer
* Warm or room-temp drinks were easier on digestion
* Replacing soda/extra coffee made a noticeable difference

By day three or four, bloating was down and my energy felt steadier. No crash, no jitters. That’s when the **Top 10 Detox Drinks That Actually Support Your Body** idea clicked for me — it’s not about “detoxing toxins,” it’s about supporting hydration, digestion, and routine.

What didn’t work was treating these drinks like juice. When I leaned too sweet, I got hungry faster. Once I stuck to simpler combinations (citrus, herbs, light greens), everything worked better. Detox drinks still need to feel like *water*, not a snack.

I followed this guide on [**Top 10 Detox Drinks That Actually Support Your Body**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/top-10-detox-drinks-recipes-benefits-7-day-plan/) because it includes a simple 7-day structure. That part helped a lot—knowing *when* to drink what removed the guesswork and made the habit stick.

Do I think detox drinks alone change your body? No. But the **Top 10 Detox Drinks That Actually Support Your Body** made it easier to hydrate well, eat lighter without trying, and reduce bloating. That combination actually *does* support how your body feels day to day.

I’ve kept a short rotation since then:

* One hydrating drink in the morning
* One digestion-focused option mid-day
* Plain water the rest of the time

It’s simple, sustainable, and doesn’t feel like a “program.”

Curious what others think — have detox drinks genuinely helped you feel better, or do you think they’re no different than just drinking more water?

I Found a Strange List of Rules,"It was past midnight when Chris and I left the old 24-hour diner at the edge of town. We had spent the evening catching up over burgers and coffee, talking about high school memories and future plans that would likely never materialize.

As we strolled toward my car parked a little further down the block, Chris slowed his pace. I glanced over and noticed him rubbing his temples. He was pale.

""Everything okay, man?"" I asked, half-jokingly. ""Too much greasy diner food?""

Chris shook his head, wincing as he leaned against a nearby lamppost. ""No, it’s… different,"" he mumbled. ""Everything's spinning."" He grimaced, clutching his stomach as he swayed on his feet.

I rushed over and grabbed him by the arm just as his legs gave out. His breathing was ragged, each breath shallow and strained. A jolt of panic shot through me. I wasn’t sure what was happening, but it was more than just a bad burger.

""Come on,"" I said, guiding him toward the car. ""We need to get you to the hospital.""

We barely made it to the passenger seat before he collapsed completely. I managed to push him inside, buckling his seatbelt as his head lolled against the window. His breathing had grown faint, his skin cold. I didn’t waste any more time. I jumped into the driver’s seat and sped toward the hospital. The roads were empty, the entire town blanketed in a pale bluish light that made everything look strangely surreal.

When the hospital finally came into view, I pulled up to the emergency entrance and skidded to a stop. The automatic doors slid open with a soft hiss, and I half-dragged, half-carried Chris inside. The bright fluorescent lights inside the emergency room burned my eyes as I shouted for help.

A nurse and a security guard rushed over immediately. Chris was placed on a gurney and whisked away into a triage room. I tried to follow, but the nurse held up a hand. ""You need to stay in the waiting room, sir. Someone will come speak to you soon.""

Reluctantly, I turned back and made my way into the waiting room. It was a small, uninviting space lined with rows of faded plastic chairs. The harsh lighting overhead buzzed like a hive of angry bees, casting a cold, sterile glow over everything. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic, with a hint of something stale, like old coffee or cheap hospital food.

The reception desk sat at the far end of the room, cluttered with stacks of paperwork and a dusty computer monitor. Behind the desk, a tired-looking receptionist typed away with little enthusiasm, barely glancing up as I entered. She looked like she had been working the night shift for years, with deep shadows under her eyes and a weary slump in her posture. A glass partition separated her from the waiting area, with a small sliding window used to speak to patients.

Aside from the receptionist, there were only a few other people scattered around the room. A middle-aged man in a wrinkled jacket sat slumped in a chair, staring blankly at the floor tiles, his face pale and drawn. Across from him, a young woman scrolled through her phone, her foot tapping rhythmically against the leg of the chair. In the far corner, an elderly woman with a hunched back knitted quietly, her lips moving as she murmured to herself, though I couldn’t make out the words.

The wall-mounted TV flickered above, showing a muted news broadcast with closed captions scrolling across the screen. Next to it, a clock ticked irregularly, the second hand jerking with each movement as though struggling to keep time. The room itself seemed caught in some liminal state.

I chose a seat near the corner, trying to calm my breathing. My heart was still racing from the rush to the hospital.

The seat beneath me was stiff and uncomfortable, offering little relief from the tension gripping my body. I shifted, trying to find a better position, when I felt something crinkle under my leg. Frowning, I reached down and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper that had been wedged into the chair. It was old and yellowed at the edges, like it had been left there for a while.

Curious, I unfolded the paper and smoothed it out on my lap. The handwriting was rushed, uneven, as if whoever wrote it had been in a hurry, or panicked. The list was numbered, and as I began to read, I couldn't help but feel a mix of surprise and amusement at what was written there.

Rule 1. ""Avoid making eye contact with the receptionist between 2:00 AM and 2:30 AM.""

I raised an eyebrow. That seemed oddly specific. Why would anyone write something like that? I glanced over at the receptionist, who was still tapping away at her keyboard, oblivious to the rest of the room. Was this some kind of prank? The idea made me smirk a little, despite the heaviness in the air.

Rule 2. ""Never walk past the reception desk without greeting the receptionist after 2:30 AM.""

I let out a short, dry laugh. ""So I’m supposed to be polite now?"" I muttered under my breath, shaking my head. It was all so ridiculous. Maybe someone had written this as a joke to mess with the people stuck here at odd hours, bored out of their minds. I could imagine some bored night-shifter scribbling out these 'rules' as a way to pass the time.

Rule 3. ""If a visitor arrives asking for directions, do not help them.""

I paused. That one was… strange. It carried a different weight compared to the others. Who wouldn’t help someone lost in a hospital, of all places?

Rule 4. ""If you hear your friend’s voice calling from down the hallway, do not leave the waiting room to look for them.""

The amusement drained from my expression. I felt a chill run up my spine, as if the temperature in the room had just dropped a few degrees. I glanced toward the dimly lit hallway that led to the ER rooms. It seemed to stretch into darkness. I shook my head, pushing the thought away. This list was just some random nonsense… wasn't it?

I continued reading, my curiosity now tinged with unease.

Rule 5. ""If a power outage occurs, stay seated and do not move.""

Rule 6. ""If a door that should be locked is found open, close it immediately and do not look inside.""

The hairs on the back of my neck prickled. I couldn’t explain why, but each rule seemed to grow darker, more foreboding as I read on. It wasn’t just the content of the rules, it was the way they were written, as if someone were trying to warn me.

Rule 7. ""Do not look through the glass doors leading to the courtyard after 4:00 AM.""

Rule 8. ""If you feel a sudden chill, do not look over your shoulder.""

That one made me swallow hard. There was something inherently unsettling about the thought of a chill creeping up on you from behind, and not being able to turn around to see what, or who might be there. I couldn't help but glance behind me, but there was nothing there. Just the same sterile room, with its faded chairs and buzzing lights.

I reached the last rule, and for some reason, my heart beat a little faster.

Rule 9. ""If a security guard tells you it’s time to leave, check the clock before listening. It's safe to leave after 6:00 AM.""

My gaze flicked up to the wall-mounted clock, its second hand twitching with every tick. It read 1:30 AM.

At the bottom of the paper, written in shaky red ink, were the words: ""Trust me. I learned the hard way.""

There was a dark, crusted stain on the corner, one that looked disturbingly like dried blood. The sight of it made my stomach twist. I rubbed my fingers over the words, feeling the rough texture of the ink beneath my skin.

I couldn’t help but let out a short, nervous laugh. ""What kind of place is this?"" I whispered to myself.

I slumped back in the chair. It was hard to shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, but I forced myself to dismiss it as a weird prank. The list couldn’t actually mean anything, just someone’s twisted idea of a joke. I leaned my head back against the wall and closed my eyes, trying to calm my thoughts. A part of me couldn’t stop thinking about Chris and the way he had collapsed in the parking lot.

The quiet hum of the waiting room wrapped itself around me, making the place feel even more isolating. That’s when I heard it. My name, spoken in a low, barely audible voice that seemed to drift down the hallway. ""Adam… Adam...""

My eyes shot open, and my body tensed. The voice was unmistakable, it was Chris. I jerked my head towards the corridor leading to the ER rooms, but there was no one in sight, just the pale overhead lights flickering. The voice came again, a little louder this time. ""Adam, help me…""

I jumped up from the chair, the sound of my name sending shivers down my spine. My feet were already moving before I realized it. I took a few steps into the hallway.

I glanced back at the waiting area, now a few steps behind me. The other visitors, still scattered about, seemed completely unaware, oblivious to the voice echoing down the hall.

""Adam…"" Chris’s voice was more desperate now, laced with pain.

I took another step down the hallway, my footsteps echoing against the floor. As I walked deeper into the corridor, the fluorescent lights overhead buzzed louder, some of them flickering out completely, leaving long stretches of darkness. The ER rooms lined the sides of the hallway, their doors slightly ajar.

I hesitated as I reached one of the open doorways. I peered inside and immediately wished I hadn’t. There, standing in the center of the dimly lit room, was a man in a patient’s gown, facing me. The man's head moved in quick, jerking motions, shaking from side to side so rapidly that I couldn’t make out any details. It was just a blur, a sickening blur. Then, without warning, the door slammed shut with a deafening bang, and I stumbled back in shock.

My breathing grew shallow as I tried to make sense of what I’d just seen. But there was no time to process it. Chris’s voice came again, further down the hallway, ""Adam, please…""

I pushed forward, forcing myself to continue. The unsettling darkness around me seemed to press in from all sides. I came across another room, the door half-open. Inside, I could see a doctor standing over a patient, his back hunched as he examined something on the table. The doctor wore a white lab coat and surgical mask, his features obscured. But there was something off about the way he moved, his motions were robotic. Then I noticed the tool in his hand, a bone saw. He raised it slowly, the harsh metal glinting under the dim light, and then I heard a gut-wrenching scream from the patient on the table.

I stumbled backward, slamming into the wall behind me, my eyes wide with terror. When I looked back into the room, it was empty. There was no doctor, no patient. Just a dark, vacant space.

My hands trembled as I rubbed my face, trying to snap out of whatever hallucination I was trapped in. ""This can’t be real,"" I whispered to myself, but the corridor seemed to stretch endlessly ahead of me, and Chris’s voice continued to call out, drawing me further in.

As I turned the next corner, I froze. There, hanging in the doorway of a nearby room, was a mass of dark hair, long and tangled, spilling down from just beyond the doorframe. It looked like someone was standing behind the door, peeking around the corner. A single eye, black as pitch, stared directly at me from the darkness.

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. The figure remained there, still and silent, just watching me. I took a slow step forward, and then the eye pulled back into the shadows, disappearing from view. The hallway was deathly quiet, save for the low hum of the lights. I forced myself to move past the doorway, my pulse hammering in my ears.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the figure again, just around the corner of the room, her head unnaturally high, as if she were crouched against the ceiling. I could see more of her this time; her elongated arm stretched out, the bony hand reaching towards me. Before I could react, the hand brushed my shoulder, cold and corpse-stiff... its fingers scratched into my skin like claws.

I bolted, my shoes squeaking on the linoleum as I raced down the hallway. I had no idea where I was going; I just wanted to get away from whatever that thing was. I threw open the first door I saw and stumbled back into the waiting room.

My heart pounded in my chest as I staggered to a stop. Everything appeared normal again, the reception desk, the plastic chairs, the other visitors who hadn’t moved an inch. It was as if none of it had happened. But my skin prickled with the lingering touch of that hand. Glancing at my shoulder, I noticed 3 faded scratch marks, a reminder that something was very, very wrong.

I slumped back into a chair, catching my breath, trying to make sense of the nightmare I had just experienced. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the crumpled list of rules, my hands trembling as I unfolded it. I glanced at Rule 4 again, the words seeming to taunt me: If you hear your friend’s voice calling from down the hallway, do not leave the waiting room to look for them.

I had ignored it, and now I was starting to believe that those rules weren’t a joke after all.

I tried to calm myself, my breathing coming in short, ragged gasps as I leaned back in the chair. I ran my hands through my hair, trying to force myself to think rationally. Maybe I was just sleep-deprived, or maybe the stress of seeing Chris collapse was catching up to me. I told myself that I had only imagined the things I saw in the hallway. But no matter how hard I tried to convince myself, the feeling of that cold hand brushing against my skin lingered.

I glanced at the clock, 1:45 AM. The minutes seemed to crawl by. I couldn't shake the dread that had settled in my chest. My thoughts drifted back to the list of rules. Each one seemed ridiculous on its own, but after my experience in the hallway, I found myself paying closer attention to each word.

That was when I noticed him, a man who hadn’t been in the room before. He stood near the entrance, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his long coat, his eyes scanning the waiting room like he was searching for someone. His presence sent a jolt of unease through me. I was sure he hadn’t been there earlier; I would have remembered his tall, lanky figure and the unsettling way his gaze seemed to linger on the other visitors, one by one.

The list. I pulled it from my pocket and read the third rule again: If a visitor arrives asking for directions, do not help them.

The man’s gaze found me, and he started walking toward where I sat. My body stiffened, every muscle tensing involuntarily. There was no mistaking his intention. He stopped a few feet away, leaning slightly forward, as though inspecting me.

""Excuse me,"" he said in a voice that was calm, but too deliberate. ""Could you help me find the ICU? I seem to be… a little lost.""

The tone of his voice was polite enough, but there was something off about it, something that put me on edge. It was as though he was trying to mimic normal speech but wasn’t quite getting it right. I glanced around the waiting room, but no one else seemed to notice the man’s presence. The receptionist didn’t even look up.

I shook my head, gripping the list tighter in my hand. ""I’m sorry. I can’t help you,"" I stammered.

The man didn’t move. He just kept staring at me, his eyes narrowing slightly. ""Are you sure?"" he asked, his voice growing softer, almost coaxing. ""It won’t take but a moment. It’s just down the hall… right?""

I didn’t know what to say. A part of me felt guilty for not helping him. But the words on the list kept flashing in my mind: Do not help them.

I forced myself to look away, hoping he would take the hint and leave. But instead, he took a step closer.

""It’s not very kind to ignore someone who needs help,"" he said, his tone now edged with something darker. I glanced at his face, and for a split second, his features seemed to shift. His mouth stretched into a wide, unnatural grin, the kind that didn’t belong on a human face. The corners of his lips seemed to extend too far, the teeth behind them slightly jagged.

I shot up from my chair, stumbling backward. The man’s smile didn’t waver as he turned his head slightly, like he was examining me from a different angle. Then, he turned towards the reception desk and started walking, slowly and unnatural. At one point, his head snapped towards me, unnaturally, the same grin on his face, as he continued walking. I froze, I couldn't look away. Then, as he reached the reception desk, he just passed thru it and then he suddenly disappeared.

My gaze darted around the waiting room. The other visitors were still exactly where they had been moments ago, their expressions unchanged, their movements as mechanical as before.

I glanced back at the receptionist. She was still at her desk, her face illuminated by the pale glow of the computer screen.

My gaze flickered up to the clock on the wall, it was 1:58 AM, and Rule 1 flashed in my mind: Avoid making eye contact with the receptionist between 2:00 AM and 2:30 AM.

After a few minutes, I glanced toward her, my eyes drifting out of habit. It was just for a second. The receptionist was staring straight at me, her eyes locked onto mine with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. She wasn’t moving. It was as if she’d been waiting for this moment.

I tore my gaze away, my pulse quickening. As I turned my head, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed her get up from her chair, her movements oddly stiff, as though her joints didn’t bend the right way. She walked forward, but not around the reception desk, she passed through it, like it wasn’t even there. I froze, not daring to look directly at her again.

I squeezed my eyes shut. I felt the air grow colder, the chill pressing against my skin. It felt as if she were getting closer. I could hear the faintest rustle of fabric, the light creak of footsteps on the floor, growing louder with each passing second.

Don’t look… just don’t look, I told myself, my hands gripping the edges of the chair. I sat there, tense and unmoving, my eyes squeezed shut as if I could will her away by sheer force of will.

Then, everything went still. The room fell into an unnatural quiet, the buzz of the fluorescent lights the only sound left to ground me in reality. I opened my eyes slowly, half-expecting to see her standing inches away from me, her face contorted into something inhuman. But the receptionist was back at her desk, looking down at the monitor, her posture as unbothered as if she hadn’t moved at all. The other people in the waiting room seemed unchanged, as though nothing unusual had happened.

I glanced at the clock. 2:40 AM.

A wave of relief washed over me, my shoulders sagging as the tension finally started to leave my body. I forced myself to my feet, my legs still shaky beneath me. I couldn’t just sit there, feeling like a trapped animal. I needed to move, to clear my head.

As I got up to walk around the room, I remembered Rule 2: Never walk past the reception desk without greeting the receptionist after 2:30 AM. I wasn’t about to take any more chances. I turned toward the receptionist and gave her a nod, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Uh… hi,"" I mumbled awkwardly.

She didn’t look up, didn’t react at all, just continued to type away on the keyboard. I took that as a good sign and began walking a slow circle around the waiting room, forcing myself to stay calm, to pretend that everything was normal.

The chill in the air hadn’t entirely left. As I walked, I could feel a subtle shift in the temperature, a lingering cold that seemed to follow me. The overhead lights flickered faintly, casting brief shadows along the walls, giving the impression that the room was expanding and contracting with each pulse.

As I rounded the corner, I felt the presence behind me, something that wasn’t there before. I didn’t hear footsteps, but I sensed it nonetheless, like the weight of unseen eyes pressing against my back. It was close, just out of reach. My instinct was to turn and look, to confront whatever was creeping up behind me, but I clenched my jaw and kept my gaze forward, remembering Rule 8: If you feel a sudden chill, do not look over your shoulder.

I walked faster, my pulse quickening as the chill seemed to grow stronger with every step. The lights buzzed louder, the flickering more erratic. I felt something brush against the back of my neck, cold and light, like a breath.

I didn’t stop until I reached the chairs again, sinking into one with a shuddering breath. The presence faded, though the air remained icy, and I rubbed my hands together to warm them. I glanced back toward the reception desk, half-expecting to see the receptionist watching me again, but she remained focused on her monitor, her face lit by the soft glow of the screen.

I leaned back in the chair, my heart still racing. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong, that the rules on that crumpled piece of paper weren’t just random scribbles left behind to scare people. Whatever game I’d found myself in, it wasn’t a joke. And now, the only way out seemed to be playing along.

I sat there for a long moment, my body trembling, trying to calm my nerves and slow my breathing.

That’s when I heard the automatic doors slide open with a soft hiss. I looked up, expecting to see another late-night visitor or a nurse making rounds, but my heart almost stopped when I saw who stepped inside.

It was Chris.

He looked perfectly fine, normal. His face had color, his clothes were clean. There wasn’t a single sign that anything had been wrong with him. Relief rushed through me, and I felt the tension in my muscles finally ease.

Chris’s eyes found mine, and he broke into a small smile as he walked over.

""Hey, Adam,"" he said casually, his voice the same as always. ""They let me out early.""

The relief was so overwhelming that I laughed out loud. ""Chris, man, you scared the hell out of me,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Are you sure you’re okay? You looked pretty bad earlier.""

He shrugged, giving a dismissive wave of his hand as he settled into the chair next to me. ""Yeah, I’m fine now. Whatever it was, I guess it passed. They ran a few tests and said there was nothing serious."" He flashed that familiar grin, the one I’d seen a thousand times. ""Guess I’m just too stubborn to stay sick.""

As we talked, something in the back of my mind itched. There was an unsettling quality to the conversation, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Chris was acting normal, too normal. He was speaking in a calm, deliberate tone, his words perfectly measured. I brushed it off, figuring it was just my nerves playing tricks on me after everything that had happened tonight.

Still, as Chris continued to talk, a strange sense of déjà vu settled over me. It was as if the conversation was looping back on itself, repeating the same phrases. His voice had the same rhythm, the same inflection, almost like a recording on a loop.

Suddenly. I turned to see a nurse walking briskly down the hallway, pushing a gurney. My stomach dropped when I saw who was lying on it, Chris. He was unconscious, hooked up to a heart monitor, an oxygen mask over his face.

My gaze darted back to the seat next to me, but the chair was empty. The Chris who had been sitting beside me was gone, vanished as though he’d never been there at all. My skin prickled as a wave of cold panic spread through me.

I stared at the empty chair for a long moment, my heart pounding in my ears. Then, I saw the nurse walking by the waiting room. She glanced over at me briefly, her expression neutral.

I jumped up from my chair. ""Wait,"" I called after her. ""Is Chris okay? My friend, he was just sitting here. What’s going on?""

The nurse slowed, turning to look at me with a small, tight-lipped smile. ""Your friend is stable,"" she said. ""But he hasn’t woken up yet.""

Her words hung in the air, leaving me cold and confused. I glanced back at the empty seat, then at the nurse as she continued down the ER hallway.

My head was spinning. Had Chris really been here, or had I just imagined him?

I sank back into my chair, my body heavy with fatigue and fear. I glanced at the clock again, 3 AM. Time was moving, but not in the way it should have. I felt trapped, as though the minutes were pulling me further into the unknown.

I pulled the crumpled list of rules from my pocket and unfolded it with trembling hands, my eyes scanning the lines again, looking for answers that weren’t there. I needed to understand what was happening to me, what was happening in this place. But the rules only deepened the mystery, the words twisting in my mind like a riddle I couldn’t solve.

Time seemed to move strangely now. I couldn’t tell how long I had been sitting in that chair, how long I had been wandering the room. The clock above seemed to skip minutes or stall entirely, and my sense of reality continued to blur. I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the fatigue that clung to me like a shroud. I glanced at the clock again, it showed 5:55 AM. Almost there, I thought. Almost free.

That was when a security guard appeared in the doorway, his silhouette casting a long shadow across the waiting room floor. He was a broad-shouldered man with a neatly trimmed mustache and a calm, almost reassuring presence. He walked toward me with an easy stride and stopped just a few feet away.

""Sir, it's time to leave,"" he said in a deep, measured voice. ""The ER is closing for non-patient visitors.""

I blinked, my thoughts catching up slowly. ""But… my friend, Chris… is still…""

Just then, I saw Chris walking out of the ER hallway. He waved to me, a tired but genuine smile on his face. Relief flooded through me, and I started to get up, then hesitated, the words from Rule 9 echoing in my head: If a security guard tells you it’s time to leave, check the clock before listening.

I turned my gaze toward the clock above the reception desk, 6:01 AM. My shoulders sagged in relief. I was finally free of this place. I nodded and followed the security guard toward the exit, Chris walking beside me. As we stepped out into the cool morning air, I felt like I could finally breathe again.

We got into my car, and I started the engine. I felt a small smile tug at my lips. I pulled out of the hospital parking lot, the tension in my chest slowly beginning to fade.

But as I drove, a strange unease crept over me. The world outside the car windows seemed darker than it should have been. I glanced at the sky, it was still a deep, inky black, with no trace of the early morning light. It was too dark, too quiet.

I squinted, peering between the trees lining the road, and my heart skipped a beat. In the shadows, I saw faint figures standing there, their forms barely visible, distorted as if they were made of mist.

Panic surged through me. I glanced at the dashboard clock, and my stomach dropped, 4:30 AM. How was that possible? It had been well past 6:00 AM when we left the hospital. I turned to look at Chris in the passenger seat, my heart pounding in my ears.

But it wasn’t Chris.

There was a shadow there, sitting beside me. Its form was a vague silhouette, its face obscured, but I could feel it watching me, feel its eyes boring into my skin. I gasped, my grip on the steering wheel tightening as my vision blurred with fear. I slammed on the brakes, skidding to a halt in the middle of the road.

Suddenly, I was back in the waiting room, seated in the same stiff plastic chair. The security guard stood in front of me, a grin spreading slowly across his face, his eyes unnaturally wide and gleaming in the harsh fluorescent light.

""Time to leave,"" he said again, his voice echoing in my head like a taunt.

I felt my mind start to unravel. Had I ever left the hospital at all? Was I trapped here, destined to relive these twisted events over and over again? I buried my face in my hands, my breathing ragged as a sense of hopelessness washed over me.

It felt like hours passed, but it could have been minutes, or even seconds. I didn’t know anymore. I was dimly aware of a nurse standing in front of me, her voice calm and soothing, pulling me back from the edge.

""Sir, your friend is stable,"" she said gently. ""He’s going to be okay, but he needs rest. He’ll be transferred to a hospital room soon, and you can visit him during regular visiting hours.""

I looked up at her, my vision clearing slowly. The waiting room was just as it had been, no sign of the security guard or anything out of the ordinary. I glanced at the clock, it read 6:30 AM, and a soft glow of morning sunlight filtered through the glass doors, filling the room with a warm light. The nightmare was over.

I nodded to the nurse, murmuring my thanks, and stumbled out of the ER, the cool morning air a welcome relief. As I reached my car, I glanced back at the hospital, half-expecting to see something out of place. But it looked like any other hospital in the early light, mundane and unthreatening. I got in the car and drove home, the sun finally rising to chase away the last remnants of darkness.

Later that day, I returned to the hospital to visit Chris. He was awake, sitting up in bed and looking surprisingly well for someone who had collapsed so suddenly the night before.

""Hey,"" I said, my voice trembling slightly as I pulled a chair up to his bedside. ""How are you feeling?""

Chris chuckled weakly. ""Better than I should, I guess,"" he replied. ""But I had the weirdest dreams last night. It was like I was half-conscious the whole time.""

My heart skipped a beat. ""What kind of dreams?""

Chris frowned, his brow furrowing as he tried to recall. ""One of them was… I came in the ER and saw you sitting in the waiting room. You looked pretty freaked out. And then there was another one… we were leaving the hospital together, just driving away into the night.""

A cold shiver ran down my spine, but I forced a smile and nodded. ""Yeah… weird,"" I said quietly, my mind racing with the memory of the night’s events.

As we sat there talking, I glanced at my shoulder, where a constant pain kept tugging at me, and saw the three scratch marks from last night.

After years of lurking, I finally took the plunge and bought my first turntable exactly a year ago. It’s been used almost daily ever since. It’s my go-to post-work ritual with a cup of coffee.

My bank account isn’t thrilled, but my ears and soul absolutely are.

I highly rate all the records I own (apart form a couple that were bought cause they were heavily discounted and helped meet the minimum for free shipping) 

But apart form the obvious ones, some standout records that genuinely surprised me this year were 

Clairo – Charm (modern jazz-pop?)

RHCP – Stadium Arcadium (the vinyl mix is amazing and makes it feel like a new album)

Tom Misch – Geography (funk overload)

Turnstile – Never Enough (WOW. Absolutely insane energy)

Deftones – Private Music (timeless quality)

Dr Dre – 2001 (can’t believe I slept on this)

John Mayer – Continuum (best-sounding record I own)

Gilberto & Stan – Samba Jazz (favourite jazz album)

Billie Eilish – Hit Me Hard and Soft (generational talent)

Coach party - caramel (modern British punk rock)

Linkin Park – From Zero (very biased but I’m just SO happy they’re back)

Damien rice - O (melancholy and gloom)

Geese - getting killed (hated the record initially, but please give it a chance if you haven’t)

How would you react if a person who behaves reservedly and calmly (a regular customer) gave you a chocolate bar with a thank-you note that mentioned your skills, the specifics of the coffee you make, and included a small compliment?

I admit it. I did exactly that. I wanted to be very careful and tried to remove any pressure. I did not ask for a phone number or a meeting. I placed strong emphasis on apologizing for any disturbance.

Over the course of the following week, I continued to come in as usual, without changing my behavior in any way. I acted calmly. She greeted me loudly.While standing at the coffee machine, she stepped away from it to double-check what temperature I wanted, even though she definitely knew. But by the end of the week, some female colleagues appeared whom I had not seen at this place before. One girl, smiling very warmly, said, “I’ve heard about you,” made the coffee, and asked me to try it, saying, “Is it the same as the one the girl usually makes for you? Did you like it?” I was confused and behaved very modestly. Another girl said that the coffee I order is very tasty and correctly guessed my other preferences. She also told me about a coffee that is not on the menu and added, “If you ask, I think they won’t refuse you.” I behaved calmly and politely. I replied that I had never heard of that coffee, that it sounded interesting, and thanked her. Everything seemed fine.

But after that moment, the girl to whom I gave the chocolate has not been there for three weeks. I am completely confused and feel very guilty.I understand that behaving this way was not appropriate. I tried to be very careful. It seems to me that I caused her significant discomfort, to the point that she had to change coffee shops. I feel absolutely terrible.",1,1766150661.0,barista,2,0.67,False

Part of me rolls my eyes at the claims; another part knows that when I hydrate better and eat lighter, I genuinely feel better. So instead of doing a cleanse or buying powders, I tried a simple approach based on **12 Detox Drinks to Flush Toxins (Recipes + Plan)** and paid attention to what actually changed.

I didn’t replace meals or do anything extreme. I just added one or two drinks a day—usually in the morning or mid-afternoon—and kept my meals normal. The biggest surprise? Consistency mattered more than the specific drink. Rotating options from **12 Detox Drinks to Flush Toxins (Recipes + Plan)** kept it interesting and made it easier to stick with.

What helped most:

* Drinking earlier in the day (before coffee or snacks)
* Choosing low-sugar options most of the time
* Sipping slowly instead of chugging
* Pairing drinks with regular meals, not skipping food

By day three or four, bloating was noticeably lower and my energy felt steadier. No dramatic weight loss, but fewer cravings and less afternoon crash. That’s where **12 Detox Drinks to Flush Toxins (Recipes + Plan)** clicked for me—it’s not about “flushing toxins overnight,” it’s about supporting hydration and digestion in a realistic way.

What didn’t help was treating these like juice. When I leaned too sweet, hunger spiked later. Once I focused on simpler blends (think citrus, ginger, herbs, greens), things stabilized. Another lesson: detox drinks work best when they *replace* something less helpful (soda, extra coffee), not when they’re just added on top.

I followed this guide for structure and variety: [**12 Detox Drinks to Flush Toxins (Recipes + Plan)**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/12-detox-drinks-to-flush-toxins-recipes-plan/). The “plan” part mattered—it helped me decide *when* to drink what, instead of guessing.

Would I say detox drinks are magic? No. But used thoughtfully, **12 Detox Drinks to Flush Toxins (Recipes + Plan)** made it easier to hydrate, eat lighter, and stay consistent without feeling restricted. That alone made my week feel better.

I’m keeping a short rotation going—one hydrating option in the morning, one digestion-focused drink later in the day—and skipping the rest.

Curious: have you found detox drinks genuinely helpful, or do you think whole foods and water do the same job?

1pqkx89,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1pqkx89/hey_can_i_vent_again_about_a_weird_experience_i/,"Hey, can I vent again about a weird experience I had in a Pentecostal group?","I talked about this before, but every once in awhile it just keeps coming back, and each it keeps making less and less sense. 

So there was a Pentecostal group that I attended for about a year and a half, and it's exactly what you think when you think of Pentecostal groups. Flashing lights, smoke machines, speaking in tongues, accusations of not being a Christian if you're not speaking in tongues or not actively speaking about God in every single sentence you ever say, prosperity gospel, the works. 

I first joined the group with enthusiasm, and I think this gained the trust of a lot of the leaders. But as I started to see the cracks in their actual relations with each other, I started to get a little annoyed, and they very quickly caught on, but seemed to think that I could just be: 'fixed.'

At one point, I ran into them on Canada Day while they were actively evangelizing downtown in the middle of the night. Since I had nothing better to do, I decided to just follow them around, although I didn't actually participate in evangelizing. 

There was one specific guy who came up and greeted me and actively started engaging in conversation. At first, I thought that he believed I was a genuine bystander, and that he was trying to preach to me, so I quickly told him that I was actually part of the group and I was just following them around. Judging from his response though, I changed my assumption to believing that someone in the group might have actively told him that I was: 'struggling with my faith,' and could use someone to talk to about that, because the discussion was very bizarre. The guy said he was a pastor, but I honestly doubt that, because I feel even a pastor wouldn't be this alien when it comes to talking with real people. 

He sounded very much talking by the script, and eventually flat out asked me if I believed in God. I said I wasn't sure, and he asked why that was my response. 

My response was talking about hell. How I didn't believe that a just God would have people tortured forever. 

The guy then seemed genuinely stunned by my response. I honestly find this incredible if I was actually the first person to give that kind of response to that kind of question. Nevertheless, the discussion seemed to turn slightly more authentic from there, and he genuinely wished me well, although in the context of me searching for God and what not. 

A few weeks later, while I was at the group simply standing alone outside, he saw me again, and asked if. Now that I was going to the group, I had converted. He seemed to have genuinely forgotten the part where I said I was already part of the group. So I responded with a simple: 

'no, not really.'

His response was more intense than I expected, he seemed genuinely baffled, almost screaming in annoyance, asking what it was I possibly needed to convert. Did I need Jesus to come down directly and talk to me? 

I found him saying this almost comedic, because my genuine answer would be... Yeah, something like that. But I felt he wouldn't really take much from an answer like that, so I simply said: 

'i don't want to be talking about this right now.'

He seemed to accept that, and the conversation managed to turn in the direction of me talking about how I didn't really feel comfortable at the group anymore. The guy didn't seem at all interested in talking about himself. But at one point, he asked me about a woman who was there on Canada Day, and asked if she was here today. I said I didn't see her today. 

His next sentence genuinely caught me off guard: 

""She's really beautiful, huh?""

I actively cringed at this question, and simply responded with: 

'Okay.'

As the event came to a close, some random guy needed a ride, so I offered him. One. Turns out, that meant that the pastor guy would be coming with us! Oh, joy!

They asked if we could stop at a Tim Hortons, and I said sure. At the drive-thru, the pastor guy just told me to order: 'a double-double,' for him. So I did. 

When he received it though, he seemed a genuine distress when he realized that it was coffee, claiming that he wanted to go back home to sleep, and didn't want caffeine. The other guy in the car pointed out that he asked for a double double, and that would naturally result in a coffee, and I asked the pastor guy I if he wanted me to go through the drive-thru again, but he said no.

Then, like something out of The Truman Show, there happened to be what appeared to be a homeless guy, probably on drugs, with a cart full of clothes stuff. The other guy in the car with us genuinely asked me to stop the car so that he could go over and talk to the guy. Having no idea what was going to result of this, I parked the car a little bit away, and then just sat there watching the guy talk to the homeless guy. The conversation didn't seem to go well, and it ended with the homeless guy taking off his shirt and literally rolling around in the parking lot, while the other guy came back inside the car, simply shouting: 

'Repent!'

As we drove away, the guy was calling attention to the homeless person rolling around in the parking lot, confidently declaring that he was having a demonic possession, before immediately changing to confidently declaring that he's having: 'an encounter with God.'

On the drive home, the pastor guy and the other guy kept talking about random stuff. The pastor asked if I had a girlfriend, and when I said no, he literally asked: 

'Why not?'

And then he also talked about how the guy preaching at the event was talking about. How he was worried that he was going to be broke at one point in his life, but for some reason, the pastor's greatest concern at this, was that if the guy went broke, his wife and kid would leave him. 

I was genuinely confused by this. Did the pastor really think that relationships couldn't be any deeper than simply money? I know that we live in a horrible world with horrible people, but for someone who claimed to be a Christian to honestly declare that a guy should always make sure that he has money so that he can keep his own wife.... Like, doesn't it say in the Bible that you're not supposed to divorce except for sexual immorality? 

Anyway, eventually I dropped them both off, and as the pastor guy left the car, he told me to keep reading my Bible, before quickly correcting himself and saying he forgot that I don't really read it that much. 

About a week later, he messaged me asking me if I wanted to meet up. 

I responded very honestly, saying that I wouldn't mind meeting up, but if we did, I didn't want it to be on the false pretense of him trying to preach to me. I said that I've had that happen before and it usually doesn't go well. 

He seemed to understand, but then never actually followed up on giving a place or a time. 

About 6-months later, he sent me another message, asking: About 6 months later, he sent me another message, asking: 

'Hello, who is this? I'm trying to figure out who the people in my contacts are.'

I responded with a chuckle, saying what my name was, and where we met.

Ive never had a UTI in my life so I'm not sure what I would expect if I did have one, but basically I left a pad on while I was on my period for around 8 hours, and another one for around 10 hours like 6 days ago. In addition, I used some summers eve wash (i have one at home and have used it for years without any issues) but I used one here twice like 6 days ago visiting my parents and I started getting some symptoms.

They include, burning feeling on outer labia, with visible redness. No itchiness, no discharge, some urgency to pee (like a twinge?), no pain while urinating, no cloudy urine, only some smell in the morning right after drinking coffee. Pee is clear or light yellow, and normal amount comes out. Worse during the day when im sitting down cross legged, least bad just when I'm waking up in the morning. I'm also dealing with a lot of trapped gas right now, and when its trapped my whole lower abdomen burns and i feel nauseous for a moment.​

This has been going on for almost 5 days now. The burning seems to slowly be getting better. I have vaginismus and a tight pelvic floor so I feel like its mimicking these uti symptoms maybe? I'd go to UC but I'm out of state visiting my parents and my insurance only works in state. ",1,1766150258.0,Healthyhooha,2,1.0,False

1pqktub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zwift/comments/1pqktub/rapha_500_strategy/,Rapha 500 strategy ?,"Hi guys,

Do you plan to try the rapha 500 challenge this year ? 500km from 24 December to 31 December. That’s an average of 62,5km per day. 

If so, what is your strategy ? Average everyday ? One big push and some rest before another one ?

So far I’ve never ridden more than 60km on Zwift on a single attempt. Not that I’m not capable but 1h15 to 1h30 seems like a sweet spot for me. And I only did that as my longest ride, 1 or 2 time per week. I usually do 150km per week between indoor and outdoor gravel or mtb (with mud and rocky gravel so low avg speed). 

Do you think pushing that hard is possible for someone who never did that much ?

My ftp is 253w, I can average 2,8w/kg for 1h without being exhausted. 

My plan is to try 50km per day, and try to incorporate a 40 laps of volcano circuit on Sunday to get 100miles and volcano badge. I will do that with Maria bot for maximum drop and slow pace of 2,2w/kg to be sure I can sustain, but such speed will result in a 4h30 ride (I’ll use those coffee break of course). 

What do you think ? What is your plan ?

I don’t mean to brag but I found this….fairly easy? I’m unsure why but not complaining. I’m 30 years old and relatively healthy aside from a thyroid condition (and the gut issues/low iron I was having that prompted this).

Honestly the worst part of the prep was the diet the week before, cutting out the roughage (pips, grains, seeds, nuts, skins etc) 7 days prior and the “white diet” 2 days before. I was able to eat the white diet up until the night before where I started my first dose. The diet made me groggy because of the lack of nutritional value in the food, I’m vegetarian and my sheet said I couldn’t even have tofu in the white diet so I was basically living on cheese and eggs and white bread.

Started my first dose at around 6pm the night prior and the second dose was at 7am this morning. Drinking it was a breeze, it wasn’t even that offensive to drink as I’d heard others in my life make out (although they probably had different prep), it just tasted like sweet lemon lolly/candy water. I believe maybe being able to drink it 1L in the night 1L in the morning helped more than people who have to guzzle it all in one night.

Going to the bathroom also wasn’t as scary as I’d feared either. It felt weird, sure, feels unnatural peeing out of your butt. But I wasn’t on and off all night. Maybe a few hours max. The first dose I stopped going just before midnight and was able to get a few hours in and the second dose I finished around 7:45 and went for a few hours before I had to leave around 10:30. I never felt the urge like I was gonna lose control, I felt when it might be coming and went and sat on the throne for a bit but I definitely didn’t feel the urgency I’d heard others talk about.

I was still worried about shitting myself in the uber when I left despite not having done so yet so wore a massive overnight pad to be on the safe side but nothing was left to come out, not even when I went to the bathroom at the hospital and squeezed a few more drops out. It was all clear. Doctor said my prep was perfect when I asked so I guess it worked.

Going under felt weird, I had only done so once as a kid. I remember looking at the doctors and they were talking to me about something but they were already hazy to look at cause my glasses were off. Next thing I was waking up groggy with sore, watery eyes (the nurse gave me some drops) and it took me a bit to come to. The nurse said I was out for only about 10 mins but I think coming to took me about half an hour. I spoke to the nurses a bit while groggy and tried to wake up, some of that convo felt hazy and like you’re not sure if you dreamt it but I do remember giving them my name etc so I was conscious.

Then once up they had me sit for a little under an hour while I waited to be picked up and gave me food and drink. I guess no restriction on what I could have as it was a coffee and a salad sandwich as well as some biscuits (cookies for americans). Kinda wish I hadn’t ate the biscuits just yet as I felt a little nauseous but no vomiting. Just like that empty stomach nauseous feeling when you wake up early on little sleep. But after a bit I felt fine. My stomach still feels a little strange from the gas I assume they pump into you.

Nurse said my blood pressure upon admission was high and despite them usually liking it stable it went down to normal after. Probably anxiety 😅 Again I don’t mean to brag, just wanted to share my personal (success I guess?) story. There were some minor findings so I’m glad I did it but I don’t know what I was so nervous about. Hopefully other people can/have had similar luck? I also have to do one in another 5 years now due to the findings so I can only hope it goes this easy next time. ",2,1766150026.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

I’m just struggling and trying to find logic in all of this,"I (31f) work as a construction manager and am so close to hitting senior. I work for a global owner and build data centers. My career is taking off. I own my own home, I have a comfortable life, I have my retirement set, etc. Only downfall is I’m plus size but I love my body and stay active with my shepherds. Two years ago, I was supposed to get married but my ex was honest, 3-months before the wedding, about how he never wanted to get married or have kids and how he lied to me for 4-years. It was for the best because I was slowly realizing he lied. Yay. So here I am, single, and annoyed. 

Before anyone says some dumb comments, no, my value does not come from being in a relationship and, no, I don’t need to be in a relationship to be happy and, no, to all the other dumb comments. My ex had a really good facade, when we first met, I love being in a relationship. Every aspect was amazing and I also love who I became in the relationship. I love love but I also loved having a partnership. There is nothing wrong with that. 

The issue is that I’m so sick of the dating pool. Guys want quieter women, thin, dependent on them, etc. or guys want a woman they can fully depend on. I don’t want to minimize myself or my accomplishments for a guy to feel like he’s leading and I sure as hell don’t want to be the provider so a guy can mooch off me and then still expect to lead (what’s up with guys just expecting to be the leaders when they have no abilities? If you’re a leader, do it but I’m not following you because of what’s between your legs). \\\*This is just about the majority of men I, unfortunately, attract.\\\* The guys who get close to be great options always end up being emotionally unavailable and avoidants. I never waste my time and just move on. I can’t seem to find a balance of quality men. I’m not even picky. The guys I’m attracted to are considered, by society, very basic / average looking. I also just want someone who shows up in a relationship and wants to be in it. I don’t think that’s ask for a lot lol. The only picky thing is they have to make at least 3/4 of my base salary because I found that when they make less it causes issues. 

It just sucks. 

I like this guy who is reserved and, when it was just the two of us, he was always more in my space, talkative, smiled a LOT, and it always felt a little flirty. We worked together on a project but now that the project has wrapped up, it’s like he is now avoiding me. \\\*It’s also the holidays and I know he’s been busy with other stuff so I’m not taking it as he’s personally avoiding me…if that makes sense.\\\* 2-months of this and then nothing kind of sucks. I was planning on asking him for coffee but he was already acting off that day so I just didn’t ask. \\\*I also never flirted first!\\\* We have a few more interactions but then we are done interacting. 

For me, I’m just frustrated. It’s like my only options are to settle or stay single. I deleted all the apps, stopped attending singles events, and have mostly stopped looking. I still show up and put myself out there but in more natural ways. It’s definitely hard because my type tends to be reserved guys and they usually aren’t out lol.

1pqkqbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1pqkqbr/finally_cracked_20k_views_after_changing_these/,Finally cracked 20k views after changing these things,"I've been absolutely addicted to creating videos for the past two years. Like genuinely checking analytics every hour addicted. I'm talking 12 hour days breaking down what performs, testing different approaches, rewriting everything, experimenting with editing styles, all of it.

The reason? I'm fully convinced video is the single biggest opportunity available right now. Growing audiences, generating income, building credibility, opening doors, everything hinges on whether you can capture attention for 30 seconds.

But here's what nearly made me quit. Despite showing up every single day, nothing was landing. I'd pour 6 hours into a video just to watch it flatline at 315 views. Tried every method from every guru. Studied tutorials. Applied ""guaranteed frameworks."" Still stuck.

I was genuinely starting to think some people just have it and I don't. Like maybe I was just missing whatever makes content resonate.

Then I had this moment where I realized, I'm putting in the work, but I'm doing it blind. I don't actually know what's broken. I'm just hoping something connects.

So I stopped trying to decode some imaginary algorithm and started measuring actual data. Went through my last 50 videos frame by frame, tracked every single drop off point, and discovered 5 patterns that kept destroying my retention.

1. Generic openers are invisible. ""You need to see this"" gets skipped every time. But ""replaced coffee with green tea and had a migraine for 5 days straight"" stops the scroll. Specificity beats mystery.

2. Second 5 is the actual decision point. Most people bail between 4-7 seconds if you haven't proven it's worth watching. I was building suspense like an idiot. Now I hit them with my best visual or stat right at second 5. That's your real hook.

3. Any pause over 1 second kills you. Seriously tracked this, anything longer than 1.2 seconds and people think the video froze. What feels like good pacing to you reads as ""boring"" to someone scrolling. Cut way tighter than feels natural.

4. Static visuals lose viewers within seconds. If your video looks the same for more than 3 seconds, people zone out. I started switching camera angles, adding b roll, changing text placement, anything to create visual variety. Went from losing 57% at the midpoint to keeping 71%.

5. Rewatch rate matters way more than people realize. Videos people watch twice get pushed way harder. Started adding quick text that's easy to miss, faster cuts, little details you catch on second viewing. Rewatch rate went from 12% to 36% and views exploded.

Honestly the biggest shift was stopping the guessing game and actually measuring what was happening second by second.

I found this tool called TikAIyzer that analyzes your videos and tells you exactly where people drop off and why. Like it doesn't just show the dropoff point, it explains the actual reason people left and how to fix it next video. That's when things actually changed. Went from 315 average views to 19k in about 3 weeks.

Native analytics show you people are leaving. This shows you the exact moment, why it's happening, and what to change next video.

If you're posting consistently but can't break 1k views, it's not your content that sucks, you just don't know what's actually working vs what you think is working.

Throwing this out here because the process of cracking this was way harder than it needed to be. Really wish someone had just shown me what actually mattered when I was doubting everything. Would've saved months of frustration and wanting to quit. So I'm explaining it clearly for whoever needs it right now.",6,1766149882.0,SocialMediaMarketing,0,1.0,False

1pqkpq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGwrites/comments/1pqkpq2/wary_christmas_everyone/,"Wary Christmas, everyone.","On a sunny autumn day in 1985, Bishop Seatrims performed the Rite of Ordination in a small church close to Needinham. That was the day I became known as Father David. I cared for the flock in that church with all my heart. I attended other congregations where my passion could be of help, as directed by the Vatican. That is, until a short, intense investigation towards the end of 2025 ended with my excommunication.


I left Needinham to pursue my calling, exorcism. That’s what led me here, to the self-governed land mass closest to the real North Pole. It isn’t on maps and no one who knows will admit it exists. It’s like an island only it isn’t. It’s Santa central, year-round home of his Elves. I’ll call it Foryst. 


My expertise is why Morris the Elf called the Vatican for help. Foryst exists around an active portal to a demon dimension. Most people don’t know how to handle an active portal. Heck, I’m sure most people don’t believe in demons or other dimensions and that tends to keep them safe. But Morris had wisely called the Vatican (calls like that happen more often than you might think). The Vatican crew decided I should fix it, but not officially as a priest. That’s why I ended up an ex-priest. 


Dariel, my contact at the Vatican, gave me background info I can’t mention here. He skipped over details like how do I get to Foryst, how cold is it in December and what would I eat there.


“Ask Morris,” Dariel said, “he’s on the line.”


Dariel left the conversation and Morris introduced himself.


“All travel arrangements are confirmed,” he said, “A red, white and green taxi will be at your door 10 o’clock in the morning. The driver will take you to a private airport. Go to Santa’s departure counter. You’ll know it when you see it. I’ll get you when you land.” He listed the clothes to bring, what not to bring, and asked if I had any allergies. He sent my travel instructions by text as well, so I couldn’t possibly get lost. Only after we’d finished the phone call did I wonder how his voice had been so clear. Like he was next door. I made a note to ask when I got to Foryst.


The taxi arrived as promised. I would have sworn the trip to the airport was no more than two hours and I have a good grasp on time. At least, I thought I did. According to my phone and all the clocks at the airport, the trip had taken 12 hours.


The flight to Foryst was a little disorienting. It was a small plane, eight seats at most. Sometimes I was sure I was the only passenger. Other times, I was certain there were up to six other people besides pilot and co-pilot. Do small planes have co-pilots? Eventually I decided as long as the plane wasn’t falling out of the air there must be a pilot. I fell into a deep, restful sleep. Our landing was smooth and luggage was available without delay.


Morris waved a “Hello David” sign at me from across the airport.  Now this might be unpopular but here it is: Morris isn’t short, he’s my height, six feet tall. All these years I, well I didn’t believe Santa was real but specific to Morris, I always pictured Elves as short. Not Morris. He’s quite muscular and he was wearing a business suit and shoes. Not boots, shoes. No gloves, scarf or hat. I admit I took a second longer than polite to extend my hand to him.


He took one of my two small suitcases and pointed to a cross between an elevator and an escalator. About five minutes later we were at a set of doors under the sign “Chelsea Hotel.” Morris motioned for me to enter and while I was caught up looking at the lobby, he spoke to the desk clerk. When he returned he handed me one of three triangles as we headed to the elevating escalator.  


“Hotel key,” he said. “That’ll open your suite, the 24 hour restaurant and the gym and pool floor. Just put it here,” he demonstrated where and how to hold it, “and you’ll get your elemove choices. Like this.” He pressed the bed-shaped light and within seconds we were at my hotel room. 


Things were similar enough to my life to be unsettling. The population of Foryst exists below ground with three exceptions. Santa, his reindeer and a select group of Elves regularly “go above” (as Morris explained) to maintain Santa’s take-off and landing sites. 


Non-Forystians are unusual and require approved paperwork to remain on Foryst. Some come to Foryst to provide specialized skills and don’t know they’ve been to Santa’s stomping grounds. Morris addressed my thoughts about his height without me asking. 


“We encourage outsiders to think of the North Pole as a magical place, and of us Elves as short and weak,” he said while turning on the wall-size TV. He flipped through the channels until he got to ‘Menu’. “Means we can wander around your world when we need to. You must be hungry. All meals are on us.”


Over breakfast, Morris laid out the portal problem in detail. “The holiday presents contain ‘sleeping demons.’ Demons come from the portal, enter or place a demon in presents. Not all of the presents. Just one per delivery bag. That’s still over two million bags. The sleeping demons must be exorcised and the portal must be shut for good. Simple. Wait.” He raised his hand as if to interrupt himself. “We leave in an hour. Shower and change. I recommend t-shirt, hoodie, jeans and running shoes.”


‘Simple,’ he said. Just exorcise a few demons from presents and close the portal. Even if Morris knew exactly where the portal was, this could take a while. Still, could be worse and I had until the 24th to get it all done. Dressed and ready to go, I stuck my hotel key in a pocket and asked how Santa fits over two million bags in his sleigh. 


“Time and space are different in your part of the world,” Morris explained as we went to the elemover. “They fit. Reindeer fly. It all happens in less than 24 of your hours.”


I exhaled loudly. “When do you Elves finish loading up the sleigh?”


Morris put his triangle key into the elemover and selected our destination, the image shaped like a reindeer. “An hour from now.”


I closed my eyes in response to an unexpected gust of wind. The wind died down and a rush of warmth circled me as I opened my eyes. Walls, windows, a table with four chairs, a door and fireplace all looked mostly normal. Normal as in, what I would see in my part of the world.


 “Ah good, you’re still with us,” Morris said from behind me. 


I turned to speak with him directly. “This isn’t Christmas Eve, what do you mean one hour?”


He motioned to the chair closest to us and sat in the one opposite. “Sorry about that. The thing of it is, Santa must deliver the presents to the companies tonight. Around the world. Twenty-four hours.” He held up a finger and made a circular motion, I guess to press home the point about ‘around the world’. 


“The whole idea is for the presents to be delivered on Christmas Eve, isn’t it?” I heard the anger in my voice. It was the reaction of five-year-old David, who still believed in Santa. Anger, confusion and embarrassment blended together, leaving me shaking slightly.


“Welcome to capitalism.” He handed me a fresh cup of coffee. “Corporations are how presents get into homes. Santa is contractually obligated to deliver to the companies.”


My jaw dropped. “Contract?”


Morris lowered his chin and stared at his coffee. “This must be difficult to absorb. The official contract was signed in the early 1900s according to your calendars. You know, when global air travel started. The companies give Santa a list of products to make. Santa must get the products to the companies to sell them for Christmas.  With me so far?”


I chugged coffee instead of answering.


“Right,” he continued, “the companies get the products today. That’s baked into the contract. So Santa leaves today. His trip on Christmas Eve is performative, but it’s also in the contract. That trip keeps up the Christmas Eve pretense. See how it all works out? Kids get what they want, parents get what they need, corporations don’t have to pay out the wazoo for anything.”


I positioned my empty coffee cup on the table. “What does Santa get out of this?”


“Santa, yes, well, he, um” Morris chanced a quick glance at me before studying his coffee again. “Foryst stays off all maps, is kept invisible from air, sea and land, and only those with business here can enter or leave.”


“Except for the demons.” I took our cups to the sink, rinsed them and set them on the drying rack. As much as I wanted to question where the sink came from, where the cups came from and where the coffee came from, I decided to go with the Foryst flow.


“The demons. Yes. Let’s discuss that before we go,” he said, pursing his lips. “Some say the corporations had no idea about the demon dimension. Others say they knew damn well what they were doing. You see...” his voice trailed off. He looked unsure of what to do.


“Allow me,” I said. He nodded so I continued. “The contract keeps Foryst a secret from the rest of the world. If Santa breaks it, Foryst will be overrun with tourists, trophy hunters and worse, within a week.”


Morris pushed back from the table to stand. He peeked between the curtains behind him long enough for me to see daylight. “You see the importance of your task.” 


Rather than answer, I asked if he was familiar with the Rite of Exorcism. He nodded. It was important to set his expectations so he wouldn’t ask questions or behave in ways that would interrupt my process. I told him that what I was about to do with the presents wouldn’t exactly align with traditional exorcism. For his own safety, and for the safety of Foryst in general, he’d have to leave me alone until I declared I was done. He agreed  although I could see he was uncomfortable. 


There was no getting around the next instruction. Uncomfortable or not, Morris would have to comply with it for everything to work. “The minute I’m done with the presents, we need to be at the portal. Are you okay with that?”


He sighed. “Foryst is designed for such a need. How will you know the exorcism worked?”


Tough question for sure, concise, to the point. I have a tougher answer. “If I’m not dead, it worked. One demon or one billion demons, if I do it properly, I’ll live through it.”


Looking back on this I’m ashamed I didn’t choose my words more carefully. Morris asked if he could pose another question, to which I agreed. He asked exactly what I expected, something I’ve been asked dozens of times. Could I exorcise all the demons from our shared planet?


“If they were all in one spot. They never are.” I didn’t mean to sound flippant. All my years, all my training, all my experience has taught me demons don’t gather in one spot on Earth. They just don’t. But if they did, someone with proper training and equipment could exorcise them all. Which might be why they don’t hold conventions in our dimension. With all this in mind, I double-checked the bottle of holy water in my hoodie’s zipper pocket. I never gave up the habit of keeping holy water with me wherever I went.


Morris chuckled. “On second thought,” he said as we left the cabin, “I’m pretty happy they don’t travel in groups. One demon is already too much.” He pointed at a bright red sleigh in the distance. There were no reindeer and I couldn’t say there were parcels in the back but there was definitely something in the back. It looked like smoke would look if it was dark, solid and far away. Also shiny, like glitter was burning miles away within arm’s length. As in, what I saw made no sense. 


Morris must have noticed me staring. “Those are the presents,” he said, “they exist in a sphere of mini molecules until delivery. It makes them seem smaller and lighter. But everything’s still there.”


I didn’t doubt Morris even though I didn’t understand a word. As a reminder, I chose religion not physics. To clear my mind I asked where the portal was. He took me a few steps from where we’d been standing and pointed at another dimensionally difficult event. A glowing circle about my height twirled above a hole no larger than my hand. Never mind that the circle isn’t attached to anything, it’s just hanging there all on its own. I recognized it as a well-maintained Locar-210 Turbo. Easy-peasy to close and seal.


After checking with Morris that it was safe to touch the sleigh, he helped me turn it. It didn’t take long. All we had to make sure was the back with the parcels faced the portal. Morris was concerned that the sleigh would be damaged. Each time he asked about it, I assured him there were different types of exorcisms. The one I was about to perform would pull the demons out of the bags and toss them into the portal. The bags and the sleigh would not, could not be damaged. 


There’s a point before most exorcisms when the person who called you gets buyer’s remorse. A case of the what-ifs. What if the demon burns everything up on the way out? What if the demon is stronger than the priest? What if the priest invites demons in instead of kicking them out? What if, what if, what if. It’s normal, it’s natural, it’s to be expected when dealing with scary topics. Morris’ hesitation didn’t surprise or upset me.


“I get it. This is new, it’s scary and hard to believe,” I said. “If you don’t want me to proceed, just say so. No hard feelings. If you’re ready to be demon-free, stand behind the first line of trees in that forest. Stay there until I call for you.”


His expression changed from intense to intensely confused to hesitantly accepting. That’s the best most of us exorcists can hope for. He gave a brief wave and didn’t stop walking until he disappeared in the forest. I waited the standard “several seconds” to give him one last chance to back out. He remained in the forest, so I carried out the exorcism. 


Despite the dimensional distortion of the bags, each one released the demon within. Smoke, flashes of light and small seismic activity occurred. The portal sucked each of those demons back to their proper place. Once the last demon left our plane of existence, the circle should have clamped down over the hole to seal itself shut. It didn’t.


My vision started blurring. I sat cross-legged and covered my face with my hands. “You’ve never failed an exorcism,” I whispered. “Come on, David!”


Forty years as a priest. I’d always been and would always be a man of peace, caring and kindness. There had to be a way to make sure no demon used the portal to enter our world again. I knew “Intra-tantum”, Inside-only. A little-known, rarely-used invocation. The name says it all, for use inside only. A side effect is wallpaper burns off all walls in the house and that wasn’t the worst it could cause. Intra-tantum is dangerous when conditions are perfect. It was also my only option.


Decision made, I stood and said a brief prayer. As I prayed, a small demon got half-way out the portal and grabbed my ankle. I saw it but didn’t feel it so for one brief, foolish moment, I tried to step back. The demon squeezed until I thought my ankle would snap. A flood of heat raced from my foot to my torso. I slapped my chest, expecting to feel flames. No flames. It was worse. The heat burning my skin was powered by the demon, not physical fire. Either I put the demon out of commission or I’d die from full-body burns and I didn’t have time to weigh the options. I poured at least two tablespoons of holy water on the demon’s head. 


The demon screamed, “I am Nifcoals”, acknowledging I’d won the right to know his name. His head and shoulders slid back into his home dimension but kept hold of my ankle by lengthening his arm to terrible proportions. He twisted my ankle until it broke then released me and disappeared. Typical demon stuff and exactly what I should have prevented.


That fueled my righteous anger. I raced through Intra-tantum. I bashed the newly-sealed portal several times with my good foot to be extra sure. I called Morris to check for himself, make sure everything was to his liking. He paid attention to each step from the forest to the portal, as if the walk was some kind of ritual for him. 


“Can I stand on it?” he asked, pointing to the sealed portal. 


I nodded and went back to poking at my broken ankle. Morris touched the portal with a finger and when that didn’t break the seal, he brought out a phone and took a picture of the now-useless portal.


“Sending this to the big man,” he said, pressing some buttons before putting the phone away. “Let’s get back to the hotel. We’ll get a doctor to set your ankle. You can spend a few days recovering there before going home. Which reminds me. Job well done! Just one question: how can you be sure the demons won’t work together and force the portal open again?”


He leaned over to help me stand. I soon realized I’d have to literally lean on him to stay standing until we got to the hotel.


“It isn’t the amount of energy that would open the portal,” I explained. “It’s the balance between good in this dimension and evil in their dimension.”


A blond Elf appeared out of nowhere and jogged up to us. He held a red delivery bag, packed to the gills, over his shoulder. 


“Last one for the delivery,” he said as he threw the bag on top of all others in the sleigh. 


I inhaled sharply but couldn’t speak. Morris looked horrified but didn’t speak.


Santa and the reindeers appeared. Santa, the reindeers and the sleigh disappeared.  I guess Morris got me back to my hotel suite because I just woke up here, cast on my ankle and painkillers next to my holy water on the side table. Don’t know where Morris is now, he hasn’t answered any of my messages.  The only person who has contacted me is Dariel, my contact at the Vatican. It was his text to me that prompted me to go public. 


Dariel’s message was simple: Wary Christmas, everyone.",2,1766149836.0,LGwrites,0,1.0,False
1pqkpp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1pqkpp1/bus_ride_through_thoughts/,Bus Ride Through Thoughts,"I’m on a Seattle bus heading home from a grueling day at work and an equally grueling day at the gym.

I stopped by at the local coffee shop, first, to secure a cappucino before I started my reverse journey for the day. I get the sudden vision of myself from a third person perspective. I take the bus driving west to start my day and then I take a bus driving east to finish it. It’s poetic. It feels like I’m a personification of our sun’s journey across the sky from dawn to dusk, daily.

I get jostled out of my thoughts by the bus coming to a slight abrupt stop. One of the may steps of its journey that it’s done everyday of its mechanical life. Funny quip - imagine if the bus had a soul and could speak about its daily travels (I wonder what stories it would tell?)? So the doors open and in walks a cute little family. They’re sweet, but I’m in a selfish mood. I press a finger to, and hold it on, my Bose earbuds to activate “immersion” mode and turn the music up a little. I catch the father’s facial expression in the mirrored window as the streets pass by. I feel bad, but sir this isn’t about you. I’m sure you’re lovely people with lovely things to talk about. But I have had a hard year. Granted, I know that there are other people who have just as hard a year or worse. The pragmatism is not lost on me, but I too am a person with my own desires and my own hardships.

While I think these selfish thoughts, it sparks another thought about how I used to interact with the world in NYC vs Seattle. In NYC, I thought of myself as polite and caring about others. I helped people where I could and even at times when it distressed me. I thought, “hey, you’re doing a good thing for a person you care about and all you’re giving up is your time. It’s worth it.” And for strangers, I helped people out like a good NY’er does growing up here. We helped random strangers, within reason, and we all quietly knew what type of help you could ask for on a “want basis” vs on a “need basis.” The same is true here for Seattle, but we’re just slightly off from each other, in a way. I notice the difference in behaviors; almost like a brother & sister who are related in fundamental ways, yet, different in so many other, equally fundamental, ways. Funny enough, that thought brought me back to my present moment on the bus.

I start to think about how I am perceived by others. Do they see me as friendly or do they view me as some callous and cold person? As the bus stops, for every rider who pulls the cord to signal a desired stop or to let new travelers onboard from the cold weather outside, I notice the passengers either waving hello/bye or saying “thank you bus driver” on their way out or coming on. This is the realization that has me comparing how I behave here, on the Seattle buses, vs how I did on NYC buses. I immediately highlight the fact that I never said “thank you” to the Seattle bus drivers on my most recent trips (including the start of this one). That realization forced me to search the depths of my memories to see if I ever thanked NYC bus drivers. I conclude I never have and then I begin to wonder if I really am a nice person or not, despite my recollection of my time in NY. Then I begin to dissect those memories further to see if I ever noticed anyone else, on NYC buses, thanking the bus driver. I’m sure there were but I do not think I ever noticed them personally. How could I not notice? I’m supposed to be this Virgo horoscope known for paying attention to the most minutiae of details. My mind races. It tries to sift through all the details and logic to arrive to some sort of epiphany, some sort of understating, and it finally reaches its desired terminus: size.

In NYC, the buses are almost always at full capacity at any given time. It reminds me of larger cities, like Hong Kong or Tokyo, and I remember watching videos of their transportation network. I remember watching a sea of strangers enter either the trains or buses and, they too, are jam packed while everyone remains steadfast in anonymity, in cold expressionless faces. Logic and pragmatism take over my thoughts, finally, and the answer begins to unveil itself. In NYC, it is harder to take the time and slow your pace for daily niceties. When you share nearly intimate spacing with total strangers all around your person, the last thing anyone anticipates is stopping to thank your driver while a sea of others need to get through you to get to their destinations. It is actually being “kind” to keep the flow moving, off the train or bus, so others are not late or delayed in where they need to go. But Seattle is not NY. Seattle is like a sister to NYC (being its brother). Seattle is softer. Seattle is smaller in size. Seattle is more aligned with just “being.” People here take the time to say “thank you” and enjoy the day at their own leisurely pace instead of being slave to the “hustle & bustle” of an overpopulated city. Seattle enjoys living in the moment and I find my soul resonating. I moved here for a reason after all. And as I alternate between awareness of my surroundings, as the city of Seattle whizzes by outside the bus window,  and deep reflection of my social quirks, I make the conscious decision to change myself.

I think about making the conscious commitment to become more present in the moment. I decide I will become more present while living my life and achieving my goals. I determine I will start small, like a growing snowball on its way down from the top of a steep mountain. I will begin by joining my fellow citizens in taking the time to thank my drivers as I enter or exit the bus from now on. I conclude that I, too, will join the rest of the Seattleites in thanking my bus driver for their diligence of their daily duties. This makes me feel something. It makes me feel satisfied because I understand I am assessing my present situation, I am investigating past memories, and I am determining to make a meaningful change in who I am…or at least who I am now and want to become.

This enlightenment brings me back to the beginning of my thoughts, on this reverse journey home. I think about how I started my day heading to work and ending my day by self-reflecting on my way home. I smile knowing that I just had a wonderful personal experience amongst total strangers on a public bus. I examined my life, my memories, of who I was and decided to make meaningful changes. I slowly return to the present, to reality, but feeling reinvigorated about myself, about my life, and the day’s hardships seem to just melt away. I turn my head, in a panoramic motion, taking in the sights of the bus. I see fellow passengers in their own worlds. I see that cute family again, but this time I notice that they too are in their own little world and beaming happiness. I catch the dad’s eyes again and we both smile shyly before we both turn our heads away from each other and back to our own lives. I feel better now and I relinquish my thoughts, so my mind can become unencumbered to the music playing in my earbuds for the remaining length of this bus ride home. I smile again and dip my head when doing so because this was not just a bus ride home, but it was a bus ride through my own thoughts.",2,1766149833.0,DeepThoughts,0,1.0,False

1pqkovw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pqkovw,I wish Devsisters never gave into the demands of people who called the Kakao Cookies (especially Fire Spirit) ugly because what in the godfuck is this design,"""But it has more detail than the original Dark Enchantress! She got transformed during the Chess Choco event! How do you even know this'll be the base design and the original won't be a costume!?""

  
A lot of the Kingdom design philosophies that I dislike seem to have reared their ugly head in an apparent Dark Enchantress Cookie redesign that was advertised on a Naver (link because I'm inevitably going to be asked of the source: https://cafe.naver.com/crkingdom/3439133) where a new Dark Enchantress Cookie design is shown and... I don't like it.

I think one of the things I dislike the most is that it tries to amp up the connections between her and White Lily Cookie, but I honestly think it's too on the nose, especially the hair. A lot of people already dislike Dark Enchantress having a simple few icing bangs to symbolize hair, which is a staple of earlier designs that has gradually eroded, with Dark Enchantress becoming one of the last examples of Cookies with hair that could be reasonably passed as done by an amateur pastry artist, among the likes of GingerBright, Coffee, Hero, Cheerleader, etc. I also think Dark Enchantress being based on a witch gives her justification to be ""ugly"" regardless.

  
They tried to make the cape look more detailed and frilly, but if you've played CROB you'll notice that it's in fact, sheer and also puffs smoke in her menu/idle animations. They also gave her wings which I don't think are a necessary deign element as she already can levitate on her staff and during her skill in CROB, and just... Having the aura to do so in general, apparently. Not a fan of the tiara, it's unnecessary. Also not a fan of the staff becoming overly detailed and symmetrical, another instance of it trying to resemble White Lily Cookie's staff even more but I don't have as much to say about it other than a thesis I'm about to get to.

I should stress that I get \*\*why\*\* they did the redesign, because Kingdom-only fans are now the majority of Cookie Run fans and they've been conditioned to enjoy the otherwise overdesigned and quite removed design philosophies of the older Cookies for what is essentially a game of telephone, where earlier designs are simpler/match the design philosophies of the time and as time went on with Kingdom having a more refined production process and no longer primarily using Adobe Animate to draw the Cookies frame by frame and instead rigging them with Spine allows these more complex designs to exist. I just wish at the end of the day that the Kingdom-original Cookies had simpler designs more in line with Kakao and 2010's CROB so the fandom would thereby be familair and more accepting of simpler designs.

With Dark Enchantress now resembling a more modern Cookie, she no longer aesthetically matches the original elemental Legendaries from 2014 - 2018 who nowadays would be likely be considered Epic Cookies if they were to release today without any lore baggage with them because the art has become so detailed and polished, which if I'm going to look at them side by side, she's going to stick out like a sore thumb, and is also why I'm glad Frost Queen and Strombringer is left out of this group. And to all of those ""Frost Queen and Stormbringer are also a part of the elementals"" truthers, none of the other 6 elemental legendaries are mentioned in their stories, they have no connection, and are basically never paired in any official material or marketed to be in the same group. Stop gaslighting yourselves, not every Legendary has to have an affiliation with another.

I'm also aware that Kingdom has redesigned some older Cookies' base designs before, with prominent examples being Rebel, Rockstar, and Shining Glitter. In the case of Rockstar and Rebel, these deigns added small elements or exaggerated certain ones (like Rebel's sash/belt) and in the case of Shining Glitter who got a major redesign, had the option to have her original design from CROB be restored with a costume, which in my opinion is a rather elegant compromise to those who prefer the original design like myself. I think if they \*have\* to do a redesign this would have been the best option, maybe make the checkerboard dress DE has more visually appealing. I didn't defend that because I think it's the weakest aspect of her original design. At the very least, make the original design a costume so I can opt out of seeing this redesign.",55,1766149771.0,Cookierun,39,0.74,False

1pqkj8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1pqkj8t/vyvanse_sleep_caffeine_etc/,"Vyvanse - Sleep, Caffeine, etc","Seems like a common topic around here but this is my experience - I'm on 10mg, its my first time being medicated since I was in high school 15 years ago and am having some struggles with sleep. Its otherwise been pretty life changing!! Very happy with the results and how I feel throughout the day. 

My routine:   
I am taking Vyvanse 10mg between 730-9am everyday. Usually with a banana and water. 

I don't usually eat much for lunch but I exercise during my lunch hour with weight lifting or a run. I eat a large, healthy, protein rich dinner daily. 

  
I am a pretty regular caffeine drinker, usually 3-4 coffee drinks a day with the last one around 5pm. I don't have any side effects from the interaction throughout the day. 

  
To sleep I've tried taking up to 5mg of Melatonin and it helped me feel drowsy on time. 

Last night - I suddenly woke up feeling like I had slept a whole night and saw on my alarm clock that it was only 12:59 - it had been like an hour and a half since I laid down in bed. The rest of the night I kind of toss and turn and I give up at 4:30. 

  
I was on concerta and adderral as a teenager and I never remember this issue. Its possible that's just situational. When I was a teen I also wanted to stay up late gaming and had to wake up at 6am for school - so maybe this just never became a problem since I was running on like 5hrs of sleep anyways? 

**Here's my two basic questions:** 

1) Does Vyvanse change your bodies relationship with caffeine? Usually, I could drink a cappuccino right before I go to bed if I want and sleep fine. Do I need to further back off the intake? 

  
2) I'm not sure what else this could mean.. Is Vyvanse's formula just not for me? ",2,1766149327.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

I usually head to work pretty early, before 6:30. So I’m used to shops near me not being open yet. Today I tried to grab coffee around 7:30 and struck out twice. Both spots were closed and didn’t open until 8. That surprised me.

For those who work in coffee shops or own one, I’m curious how that decision gets made.

Is there just not enough demand between 7 and 8?

Does labor make it hard to open earlier?

Is that hour less profitable than staying open later in the day?

How do I even begin this story without it turning into an analysis of my ex-boyfriend or my own mental state? A few things to mention first: we met on a dating app and had a really long, nice phone call. People often tell me that I rush into things and that I am pretty naive. He is two years older than me, and due to an injury as well as other past poor decisions, he decided not to return to school for an unknown amount of time to finish his degree.

He pressured me into dating him. I wanted to take things slower, but he kept asking and reassuring me that everything would be better if we just committed. Eventually, I did, reluctantly, because of how fast everything was moving. I met his friends and family very early on, which shocked me given the speed of the relationship. We became increasingly intimate. We took some time before having penetrative sex, and I am only sharing this because it is anonymous, but I had sexual trauma and still do. We worked through it slowly, though we were both very physically drawn to each other. We could not keep our hands off each other, and it is important to note that he lived in the same apartment as his mother.

As time passed, it became difficult to adjust to a dynamic where it felt like everyone had a say in our relationship. At times, I could overhear him complaining about spending money, even though he had been nonchalant about it during our first few dates. I was transparent about my situation. I was focused on studying, wanted to go to grad school, and relied mostly on my parents financially. Eventually, because I was constantly at his mother’s apartment and we were having sex all the time, and we only ever left to go on expensive restaurant dates, she lost her patience and kicked me out.

As this tension grew, so did the tension between his friends and me. They rebuked me, accusing me of being stuck-up or asking for too much, even though he never clearly communicated expectations around money or his ability to provide food outside of my campus. I wished he had been clear from the beginning. Was it wrong for me to expect to be fed when all we did for hours was switch between homework and sex while he switched between sex, video games, and alcohol?

I kept breaking up with him, and his friends would reach out, convincing me to take him back. I still question why I stayed. Was it because of the sex? Because I fell for him even though everyone told me he was not good for me? Did I attach because of intimacy? Did I convince myself he was the best I would ever do, or did I let him convince me of that?

Eventually, I grew resentful. He wanted constant contact and validation, checked my phone, and expected me to play nice with friends and family who clearly disliked me. Over time, it felt like he wanted me to be both a housewife and the breadwinner. I finally gave up and broke up with him for the eighth time.

To anyone reading this, I really tried. I tried to understand his financial situation, the scars from his only previous relationship, and how his parents’ divorce affected him. I tried to help him, and he tried to help me in his own way. Still, I became borderline suicidal because of how deprioritized and insecure his inconsistency and alcohol-like tendencies made me feel, tendencies that his family and friends enabled.

I love him deeply. But the stress of my major, my family being on my case after finding out about him, and my overall lack of support pushed me to pull the plug. I crashed out badly. I cut up his clothes, cussed him out through messages, lashed out at his friends, and completely lost control again. I drank alcohol, a Celsius, and a Starbucks coffee all together. I am not proud of this.

What I am trying to ask is this: how am I supposed to feel okay or have any sense of self-worth when the one man who treated me with some level of respect still fell miles short of a relationship worth my time and love? I clung to him so tightly that the day before the final breakup, I called him to pick me up just so I could have someone hold me and keep me from hurting myself. I really did love him, who writes that many love letters to someone and be treated this poorly.

TL;DR: I met my ex two months ago very tumultuous relationship, reflecting on relationship how do I navigate romantic relationships better, so I don't keep getting taken advantage of.",1,1766149130.0,amiwrong,1,1.0,False

(Open to Fun or Something More)","As the year winds down, I’m sitting here realizing I don’t want to ring in 2026 solo, stuffing 12 grapes under the table at midnight like some kind of superstitious squirrel. (If you’re not familiar, it’s that whole “eat grapes for good luck” tradition – cute in theory, lonely in practice.) Instead, I’m putting myself out there in hopes of finding a fantastic woman to share the countdown with. Whether it’s a night of lighthearted fun, laughter, and zero commitments, or the start of something deeper and more meaningful, I’m genuinely open to wherever the vibe takes us.

A bit about me: I’m 27, based in Bengaluru, standing at 5’11” with an normal build from occasional hikes. Professionally, I’m in AI field, which keeps me busy but not buried – I value work-life balance and make time for the things (and people) that matter. Personality-wise, I’m laid-back with a sarcastic sense of humor, an optimist at heart, and always down for spontaneous adventures. I love exploring new spots in the city, trying out craft beers or hole-in-the-wall eateries, binge-watching sci-fi shows (huge fan of Friends, How i met your. Mother and anything Marvel), or just chilling with deep conversations over coffee.

What I’m looking for: A woman (21-35ish) who’s fun-loving, positive, and up for celebrating New Year’s in style. We could grab drinks at a lively bar, dance the night away at a party, watch fireworks from a rooftop, or keep it cozy with a home-cooked dinner and board games – I’m flexible! If you’re the type who enjoys witty banter, trying new things, and maybe a bit of flirting, we’ll hit it off. Bonus points if you’re into travel, outdoor activities, or have a killer playlist for the drive.

To be clear, I’m not here for games or drama. If things click and we both feel a spark, I’m 100% ready for a serious commitment – building something real with trust, support, and shared goals. But if it’s just a casual, no-strings-attached evening of good company and great memories, that’s cool too. Life’s too short not to be honest about what you want, right?
If this sounds like your vibe, shoot me a DM with a bit about yourself, what you’re into, and maybe your idea of the perfect New Year’s plan. Let’s make 2026 start with a bang (or at least better than grape-munching alone)!

P.S. Pics exchanged after chatting – safety first!

my very first score was a 1270, september sat without much prep i went to 1390 - this one was purely frontal lobe development and me being a senior. But the issue was i had 650 math and 740 rw and i had to get my math up.

Note: i may not have a 770 or a 770 in math but this may help your prep strategy 

CRAM TIPS:

I took 3 practice tests total in a very short amount of time, BUT dont just spam them with no cooldown.

Do in this order:

1. Practice test

2. Notice what areas you scored less in, first drill in the explanations of the answers you got wrong and make sure you answer them correctly next time.

3. For that area, do practice problems from oneprep.xyz, dont mindlessly do easy algebra problems if you want a 740+, do hard ones, choose score band 7.

4. Take a 20 min break, listen to music or something idk

5. Next practice test

this is just a lengthy spelled out way of saying, identify and fix your weaknesses. Oneprep.xyz is godsent, if anyone from oneprep sees this ily bro. Like my attention span was bad so even if psda was easy i lost focus, doing those helped me ( based on my weaknesses )

6.  Im a very anxious person so i did A LOT of practice problems till i was starting to mildly get calm 

I pulled an all nighter with lots of coffee on 4th so maybe that blunted my reading comprehension but anyways goodluck for whenever ur next sat is",2,1766148931.0,Sat,0,1.0,False

My husband is an immigrant. We were together for 5 years total (4 years dating, 1 year married). During that time, he had not seen his family in 8 years because of immigration issues. Last year, we got married and filed for his green card.

Our relationship started getting worse after I went to visit his family in Kazakhstan earlier this year. Part of the reason for that trip was to have photos together for our immigration case, since we had been together so long but hadn’t met his family yet.

He was upset about me going because of the cost of the ticket and accused me of only wanting to go so I could visit a friend in Turkey afterward (which I did on my way home). At the time, he was stressed about money and trying to aggressively pay off debt from a truck he put on a credit card. For reference, I make about $4,000/month, and he makes $10,000–$15,000/month.

When I visited his family, his mother made several racist comments toward me. I’m Black, and at the time I had braids. She said it was “dirty” that I don’t wash my hair every day, compared my skin to a “black coffee scrub” at a spa, and later I found messages on his phone where she called me a gypsy and said I was an embarrassment in front of God.

Fast forward to November: we had our second green card interview, it went well, and he received his green card three days later.

As soon as that happened, he called his mom. She told him to buy tickets immediately and come home for New Year’s. At first, he said he didn’t want to go and didn’t want to buy tickets. I encouraged him, saying we could afford it now since his debt was paid off.

I assumed I would be going with him as his wife. He said no, that it would be too expensive. I then said my parents would pay for my ticket. We argued, and eventually he agreed—but warned me not to “make the trip about myself,” saying I’m extremely selfish and always do.

Recently, I asked him one thing before we go: that I don’t want discussions about my hair or schooling with his mom, because of the racist comments last time. I wasn’t asking him to control his parents—just to be aware and supportive.

He told me he would not “monitor” what his parents say, that this trip has nothing to do with me, and that he doesn’t want to think about me while he’s there. He said he doesn’t want to worry about whether I’ve eaten, how I’m feeling, or if someone says something offensive to me.

Then he said:

“You’re not coming. I’m canceling your ticket. I’ll give you the money back. I know this trip will end up being about you, and I don’t want that.”

I’m obviously hurt. But now the bigger issue is that my mom and friends think he used me for a green card, and that our marriage might be fraudulent.

I don’t know if this is normal behavior or a massive red flag. I feel pushed out of my own marriage the moment he got his green card.

(Or both),"So I (m22) am a bit autistic and can’t pick up social cues at times, so when someone starts flirting with me or gives me hints I just don’t notice it and think they are just being nice. 
It has become sort of a joke with my friends. They call me love blind because like I said I don’t notice when someone is flirting, and I just think they are being nice. 

A little backstory, I (m22) have been friends with (f20) for over three years now. We met in collage, she sat next to me and we started talking and became friends. Honestly I just saw her as a friend for those three years and didn’t think she was interested in me at al. More because she sometimes would talk about her love life and some guys she met or had a crush on, that was fine because at the time I wasn’t really interested in dating. 
I kind of change the way that I behave when I am at collage, I’m more quiet and just don’t talk a lot. She noticed that and said that I could be myself when I was around her and that she would do the same if she was around me. 
People started to notice that she and I would be different when we were around each other and started joking that we would be a great couple, and some people thought we were a couple. 

A couple of weeks ago we were invited to a birthday party for someone that we both know.
After a couple of hours into the birthday party we started to play a game. Someone who was also playing the game made a racist remark towards me and my friend instantly looked up to me to see if I heard it. I jokingly tried to ignore it but the one who made the remark just doubled down on the racism and didn’t stop. I stood up and walked away to get something to drink and when I got back everyone was quiet and after 10 mins my friend told me that we had to leave. While we were in the car she told me what happened after I stood up. It turns out that when I got up and went away the person who made the remark said that I shouldn’t be crying over a joke and that it was just a joke, someone else chimed in and also said that I shouldn’t cry over a little joke, then the one who began told everyone else at the party that I was crying the whole night. 
 
While in the car ride back my friend kept going on how fucked that was, I have never seen her that angry before in my life. She just went on and on on disrespectful that was towards me and what a bitch that girl was. I jokingly told her that I like how she cares about me and that I love her for that.  

So a week after that I invited her to get something to drink. It went well and we talked about a lot. after I got home I invited her again the next week she said ok and said that she would text me the dates when she had time. 
After a week of radio silence from her I texted again and she apologized and said that she was busy with work and collage and she forgot. I told het that it was fine and if she didn’t have time it would be ok, she kept apologizing and said that she would send the info later, another week passed and she texted me apologizing again and said that she just was really busy and that everything went wrong this month. 
I told her that that was fine.
2 days later she texted me that she would be free next week. 
But here is the thing, out of nowhere she just said that she talked with an old collage friend that we both know and said, yeah /insert name/ asked if something would become of us. So I asked her if she meant me and her. She said yeah. I didn’t think much about it and just answered with oh that sounds exciting.

I was just talking to some of my close friends while gaming and they all said that that was a hint and called me blind again. 
The next day she texted me and asked what I was doing on /insert date/. I just answered with you, she didn’t react to that text. Later in the day I called her (yes we call often) and asked why she didn’t text me back, she told me that she was busy and thought that she did text me back. She told me that she forgot the send the text but that it was already typed out and her answer was, okey what time do you want to meet? 
She told me that she had found a new coffee store and that she wanted to go there so that I can try out something new instead of my regula choice. I jokingly told her that i’m not good with new thing and that if she orders a new drink I would just taste hers first, she told me that would be fine and she cant wait. 
I told my friends about it and they all say that she wants to be more then friends now

I know that I have written a lot and maybe a lot of information that is just irrelevant, but reddit do you think she wants to be more than friends? Or am I and my friends looking into it too much? ",1,1766148460.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

Then I meet them -all separate incidents- to talk about the project, find out they are generally in their 50's or so, and with little experience. But a shockingly huge ego. Each with less than 5 years of experience (I'm guessing covid has something to do with it), and I guess they get fairly decent contracts because people assume that because they're older they are more experienced?

One guy asked me — after saying he's looking for an experienced camera operator — *why he should hire his competition*. Then went on to ask how I would light something in the coffee shop we were in. I say, something with a controlled 6x6 and some reflectors to keep out of the way and work with the available light, and he goes on to explain how he would block out the (floor to ceiling) windows, set up lights all the way around the building and put LED tubes everywhere.

Delivery took about 10 to 12 days and everything arrived clean. First try-on already felt right. The Miu Miu hoodie instantly became a favorite because it feels soft, relaxed, and expensive without being loud. The Supreme jacket has good weight and structure, and the CP Company hoodie and tee feel super wearable. Nothing felt stiff or awkward, which made rotating everything easy from day one.

After wearing everything for two weeks, the niches are clear. I wear the Miu Miu hoodie during the day for coffee runs, sunlight fits, and casual plans. The Supreme jacket comes out in cooler mornings and evenings when I want something light but still statement. The CP Company hoodie and short sleeve tee are my daily basics for errands, long walks, and low effort days.

For bottoms and shoes, I switch based on weather and mood. I wear the Rhude shorts and Nike Stussy shorts during warm afternoons and chill hangouts. COR shorts are perfect for home days or quick outside runs. Chrome Hearts jeans are my night option when I want the fit to hit harder. I rotate the blue and pink Nocta Air Force 1s mostly in the daytime because the colors pop way more in natural light.

Accessories finish everything cleanly. I grab the Gucci hat or COR hat on sunny days, and the RL hat when I want something simple. I wear the Van Cleef piece when the outfit is minimal and needs a quiet flex. Yeezy slippers are my default for lazy days and quick errands. ",1,1766147755.0,Repcnbuy,0,1.0,False

I’m considering a move to Columbus next year for work at a children’s hospital and wanted to hear from locals about what day-to-day life in the city is really like.

I’m in my mid-20s and coming from abroad, so I’d really appreciate honest insight on a few things that are important to me:

* Which areas are popular with young professionals? Any neighborhoods you’d especially recommend (or avoid)?
* How realistic is it to live without a car initially? Are buses, biking, or rideshares manageable, or is a car pretty essential?
* Does Columbus feel affordable for someone early in their career? Any hidden or unexpected costs?
* How would you describe the restaurant and coffee culture? Are there good international food options?
* Are there recreational sports leagues (volleyball, pickleball), gyms, parks, or outdoor activities people enjoy?
* What’s the general vibe for people in their 20s–30s? How’s the nightlife and social scene?
* How do people feel about winters and summers here, and does weather significantly affect daily life?
* How easy is it to build a social circle, especially for someone moving from outside the U.S.?

I’d really appreciate any pros/cons, personal experiences, or things you wish you’d known before moving to Columbus. Thanks so much in advance!",0,1766147591.0,Columbus,28,0.46,False

1pqjxi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1pqjxi7/wary_christmas_everyone/,"Wary Christmas, everyone.","On a sunny autumn day in 1985, Bishop Seatrims performed the Rite of Ordination in a small church close to Needinham. That was the day I became known as Father David. I cared for the flock in that church with all my heart. I attended other congregations where my passion could be of help, as directed by the Vatican. That is, until a short, intense investigation towards the end of 2025 ended with my excommunication.


I left Needinham to pursue my calling, exorcism. That’s what led me here, to the self-governed land mass closest to the real North Pole. It isn’t on maps and no one who knows will admit it exists. It’s like an island only it isn’t. It’s Santa central, year-round home of his Elves. I’ll call it Foryst. 


My expertise is why Morris the Elf called the Vatican for help. Foryst exists around an active portal to a demon dimension. Most people don’t know how to handle an active portal. Heck, I’m sure most people don’t believe in demons or other dimensions and that tends to keep them safe. But Morris had wisely called the Vatican (calls like that happen more often than you might think). The Vatican crew decided I should fix it, but not officially as a priest. That’s why I ended up an ex-priest. 


Dariel, my contact at the Vatican, gave me background info I can’t mention here. He skipped over details like how do I get to Foryst, how cold is it in December and what would I eat there.


“Ask Morris,” Dariel said, “he’s on the line.”


Dariel left the conversation and Morris introduced himself.


“All travel arrangements are confirmed,” he said, “A red, white and green taxi will be at your door 10 o’clock in the morning. The driver will take you to a private airport. Go to Santa’s departure counter. You’ll know it when you see it. I’ll get you when you land.” He listed the clothes to bring, what not to bring, and asked if I had any allergies. He sent my travel instructions by text as well, so I couldn’t possibly get lost. Only after we’d finished the phone call did I wonder how his voice had been so clear. Like he was next door. I made a note to ask when I got to Foryst.


The taxi arrived as promised. I would have sworn the trip to the airport was no more than two hours and I have a good grasp on time. At least, I thought I did. According to my phone and all the clocks at the airport, the trip had taken 12 hours.


The flight to Foryst was a little disorienting. It was a small plane, eight seats at most. Sometimes I was sure I was the only passenger. Other times, I was certain there were up to six other people besides pilot and co-pilot. Do small planes have co-pilots? Eventually I decided as long as the plane wasn’t falling out of the air there must be a pilot. I fell into a deep, restful sleep. Our landing was smooth and luggage was available without delay.


Morris waved a “Hello David” sign at me from across the airport.  Now this might be unpopular but here it is: Morris isn’t short, he’s my height, six feet tall. All these years I, well I didn’t believe Santa was real but specific to Morris, I always pictured Elves as short. Not Morris. He’s quite muscular and he was wearing a business suit and shoes. Not boots, shoes. No gloves, scarf or hat. I admit I took a second longer than polite to extend my hand to him.


He took one of my two small suitcases and pointed to a cross between an elevator and an escalator. About five minutes later we were at a set of doors under the sign “Chelsea Hotel.” Morris motioned for me to enter and while I was caught up looking at the lobby, he spoke to the desk clerk. When he returned he handed me one of three triangles as we headed to the elevating escalator.  


“Hotel key,” he said. “That’ll open your suite, the 24 hour restaurant and the gym and pool floor. Just put it here,” he demonstrated where and how to hold it, “and you’ll get your elemove choices. Like this.” He pressed the bed-shaped light and within seconds we were at my hotel room. 


Things were similar enough to my life to be unsettling. The population of Foryst exists below ground with three exceptions. Santa, his reindeer and a select group of Elves regularly “go above” (as Morris explained) to maintain Santa’s take-off and landing sites. 


Non-Forystians are unusual and require approved paperwork to remain on Foryst. Some come to Foryst to provide specialized skills and don’t know they’ve been to Santa’s stomping grounds. Morris addressed my thoughts about his height without me asking. 


“We encourage outsiders to think of the North Pole as a magical place, and of us Elves as short and weak,” he said while turning on the wall-size TV. He flipped through the channels until he got to ‘Menu’. “Means we can wander around your world when we need to. You must be hungry. All meals are on us.”


Over breakfast, Morris laid out the portal problem in detail. “The holiday presents contain ‘sleeping demons.’ Demons come from the portal, enter or place a demon in presents. Not all of the presents. Just one per delivery bag. That’s still over two million bags. The sleeping demons must be exorcised and the portal must be shut for good. Simple. Wait.” He raised his hand as if to interrupt himself. “We leave in an hour. Shower and change. I recommend t-shirt, hoodie, jeans and running shoes.”


‘Simple,’ he said. Just exorcise a few demons from presents and close the portal. Even if Morris knew exactly where the portal was, this could take a while. Still, could be worse and I had until the 24th to get it all done. Dressed and ready to go, I stuck my hotel key in a pocket and asked how Santa fits over two million bags in his sleigh. 


“Time and space are different in your part of the world,” Morris explained as we went to the elemover. “They fit. Reindeer fly. It all happens in less than 24 of your hours.”


I exhaled loudly. “When do you Elves finish loading up the sleigh?”


Morris put his triangle key into the elemover and selected our destination, the image shaped like a reindeer. “An hour from now.”


I closed my eyes in response to an unexpected gust of wind. The wind died down and a rush of warmth circled me as I opened my eyes. Walls, windows, a table with four chairs, a door and fireplace all looked mostly normal. Normal as in, what I would see in my part of the world.


 “Ah good, you’re still with us,” Morris said from behind me. 


I turned to speak with him directly. “This isn’t Christmas Eve, what do you mean one hour?”


He motioned to the chair closest to us and sat in the one opposite. “Sorry about that. The thing of it is, Santa must deliver the presents to the companies tonight. Around the world. Twenty-four hours.” He held up a finger and made a circular motion, I guess to press home the point about ‘around the world’. 


“The whole idea is for the presents to be delivered on Christmas Eve, isn’t it?” I heard the anger in my voice. It was the reaction of five-year-old David, who still believed in Santa. Anger, confusion and embarrassment blended together, leaving me shaking slightly.


“Welcome to capitalism.” He handed me a fresh cup of coffee. “Corporations are how presents get into homes. Santa is contractually obligated to deliver to the companies.”


My jaw dropped. “Contract?”


Morris lowered his chin and stared at his coffee. “This must be difficult to absorb. The official contract was signed in the early 1900s according to your calendars. You know, when global air travel started. The companies give Santa a list of products to make. Santa must get the products to the companies to sell them for Christmas.  With me so far?”


I chugged coffee instead of answering.


“Right,” he continued, “the companies get the products today. That’s baked into the contract. So Santa leaves today. His trip on Christmas Eve is performative, but it’s also in the contract. That trip keeps up the Christmas Eve pretense. See how it all works out? Kids get what they want, parents get what they need, corporations don’t have to pay out the wazoo for anything.”


I positioned my empty coffee cup on the table. “What does Santa get out of this?”


“Santa, yes, well, he, um” Morris chanced a quick glance at me before studying his coffee again. “Foryst stays off all maps, is kept invisible from air, sea and land, and only those with business here can enter or leave.”


“Except for the demons.” I took our cups to the sink, rinsed them and set them on the drying rack. As much as I wanted to question where the sink came from, where the cups came from and where the coffee came from, I decided to go with the Foryst flow.


“The demons. Yes. Let’s discuss that before we go,” he said, pursing his lips. “Some say the corporations had no idea about the demon dimension. Others say they knew damn well what they were doing. You see...” his voice trailed off. He looked unsure of what to do.


“Allow me,” I said. He nodded so I continued. “The contract keeps Foryst a secret from the rest of the world. If Santa breaks it, Foryst will be overrun with tourists, trophy hunters and worse, within a week.”


Morris pushed back from the table to stand. He peeked between the curtains behind him long enough for me to see daylight. “You see the importance of your task.” 


Rather than answer, I asked if he was familiar with the Rite of Exorcism. He nodded. It was important to set his expectations so he wouldn’t ask questions or behave in ways that would interrupt my process. I told him that what I was about to do with the presents wouldn’t exactly align with traditional exorcism. For his own safety, and for the safety of Foryst in general, he’d have to leave me alone until I declared I was done. He agreed  although I could see he was uncomfortable. 


There was no getting around the next instruction. Uncomfortable or not, Morris would have to comply with it for everything to work. “The minute I’m done with the presents, we need to be at the portal. Are you okay with that?”


He sighed. “Foryst is designed for such a need. How will you know the exorcism worked?”


Tough question for sure, concise, to the point. I have a tougher answer. “If I’m not dead, it worked. One demon or one billion demons, if I do it properly, I’ll live through it.”


Looking back on this I’m ashamed I didn’t choose my words more carefully. Morris asked if he could pose another question, to which I agreed. He asked exactly what I expected, something I’ve been asked dozens of times. Could I exorcise all the demons from our shared planet?


“If they were all in one spot. They never are.” I didn’t mean to sound flippant. All my years, all my training, all my experience has taught me demons don’t gather in one spot on Earth. They just don’t. But if they did, someone with proper training and equipment could exorcise them all. Which might be why they don’t hold conventions in our dimension. With all this in mind, I double-checked the bottle of holy water in my hoodie’s zipper pocket. I never gave up the habit of keeping holy water with me wherever I went.


Morris chuckled. “On second thought,” he said as we left the cabin, “I’m pretty happy they don’t travel in groups. One demon is already too much.” He pointed at a bright red sleigh in the distance. There were no reindeer and I couldn’t say there were parcels in the back but there was definitely something in the back. It looked like smoke would look if it was dark, solid and far away. Also shiny, like glitter was burning miles away within arm’s length. As in, what I saw made no sense. 


Morris must have noticed me staring. “Those are the presents,” he said, “they exist in a sphere of mini molecules until delivery. It makes them seem smaller and lighter. But everything’s still there.”


I didn’t doubt Morris even though I didn’t understand a word. As a reminder, I chose religion not physics. To clear my mind I asked where the portal was. He took me a few steps from where we’d been standing and pointed at another dimensionally difficult event. A glowing circle about my height twirled above a hole no larger than my hand. Never mind that the circle isn’t attached to anything, it’s just hanging there all on its own. I recognized it as a well-maintained Locar-210 Turbo. Easy-peasy to close and seal.


After checking with Morris that it was safe to touch the sleigh, he helped me turn it. It didn’t take long. All we had to make sure was the back with the parcels faced the portal. Morris was concerned that the sleigh would be damaged. Each time he asked about it, I assured him there were different types of exorcisms. The one I was about to perform would pull the demons out of the bags and toss them into the portal. The bags and the sleigh would not, could not be damaged. 


There’s a point before most exorcisms when the person who called you gets buyer’s remorse. A case of the what-ifs. What if the demon burns everything up on the way out? What if the demon is stronger than the priest? What if the priest invites demons in instead of kicking them out? What if, what if, what if. It’s normal, it’s natural, it’s to be expected when dealing with scary topics. Morris’ hesitation didn’t surprise or upset me.


“I get it. This is new, it’s scary and hard to believe,” I said. “If you don’t want me to proceed, just say so. No hard feelings. If you’re ready to be demon-free, stand behind the first line of trees in that forest. Stay there until I call for you.”


His expression changed from intense to intensely confused to hesitantly accepting. That’s the best most of us exorcists can hope for. He gave a brief wave and didn’t stop walking until he disappeared in the forest. I waited the standard “several seconds” to give him one last chance to back out. He remained in the forest, so I carried out the exorcism. 


Despite the dimensional distortion of the bags, each one released the demon within. Smoke, flashes of light and small seismic activity occurred. The portal sucked each of those demons back to their proper place. Once the last demon left our plane of existence, the circle should have clamped down over the hole to seal itself shut. It didn’t.


My vision started blurring. I sat cross-legged and covered my face with my hands. “You’ve never failed an exorcism,” I whispered. “Come on, David!”


Forty years as a priest. I’d always been and would always be a man of peace, caring and kindness. There had to be a way to make sure no demon used the portal to enter our world again. I knew “Intra-tantum”, Inside-only. A little-known, rarely-used invocation. The name says it all, for use inside only. A side effect is wallpaper burns off all walls in the house and that wasn’t the worst it could cause. Intra-tantum is dangerous when conditions are perfect. It was also my only option.


Decision made, I stood and said a brief prayer. As I prayed, a small demon got half-way out the portal and grabbed my ankle. I saw it but didn’t feel it so for one brief, foolish moment, I tried to step back. The demon squeezed until I thought my ankle would snap. A flood of heat raced from my foot to my torso. I slapped my chest, expecting to feel flames. No flames. It was worse. The heat burning my skin was powered by the demon, not physical fire. Either I put the demon out of commission or I’d die from full-body burns and I didn’t have time to weigh the options. I poured at least two tablespoons of holy water on the demon’s head. 


The demon screamed, “I am Nifcoals”, acknowledging I’d won the right to know his name. His head and shoulders slid back into his home dimension but kept hold of my ankle by lengthening his arm to terrible proportions. He twisted my ankle until it broke then released me and disappeared. Typical demon stuff and exactly what I should have prevented.


That fueled my righteous anger. I raced through Intra-tantum. I bashed the newly-sealed portal several times with my good foot to be extra sure. I called Morris to check for himself, make sure everything was to his liking. He paid attention to each step from the forest to the portal, as if the walk was some kind of ritual for him. 


“Can I stand on it?” he asked, pointing to the sealed portal. 


I nodded and went back to poking at my broken ankle. Morris touched the portal with a finger and when that didn’t break the seal, he brought out a phone and took a picture of the now-useless portal.


“Sending this to the big man,” he said, pressing some buttons before putting the phone away. “Let’s get back to the hotel. We’ll get a doctor to set your ankle. You can spend a few days recovering there before going home. Which reminds me. Job well done! Just one question: how can you be sure the demons won’t work together and force the portal open again?”


He leaned over to help me stand. I soon realized I’d have to literally lean on him to stay standing until we got to the hotel.


“It isn’t the amount of energy that would open the portal,” I explained. “It’s the balance between good in this dimension and evil in their dimension.”


A blond Elf appeared out of nowhere and jogged up to us. He held a red delivery bag, packed to the gills, over his shoulder. 


“Last one for the delivery,” he said as he threw the bag on top of all others in the sleigh. 


I inhaled sharply but couldn’t speak. Morris looked horrified but didn’t speak.


Santa and the reindeers appeared. Santa, the reindeers and the sleigh disappeared.  I guess Morris got me back to my hotel suite because I just woke up here, cast on my ankle and painkillers next to my holy water on the side table. Don’t know where Morris is now, he hasn’t answered any of my messages.  The only person who has contacted me is Dariel, my contact at the Vatican. It was his text to me that prompted me to go public.

I managed to get a bulk order 5 pack  in on Amazon at that time. The individual packages of 100 were not available at that time. I noticed that for the last 2 or three bags of that order of filters, my drawdown times increased by about a minute on average. I didn’t associate this at the time with the filters, because I have been loving this brand and have had great success. I worked around this by increasing my grind size, thinking something was going on with my grinder (ode gen 2) or my kettle temp control, or my beans having slightly different roast profile.  This was a noticeable change, enough that I began suspecting the filters, after checking everything else. I just got my next order of filters in, and immediately observed notable differences in the texture of the filters, as well as my drawdown times going back to normal, and my recipes instantly dialing in the way id been brewing different beans earlier in the year.  Clearly the filters changed - at least on some of the bulk order bags that I got from Amazon. 

A few others have reported this difference  in the past. Im suspecting either a batch of the wrong Cafec were packaged incorrectly at the factory - when the availability was low, or some bags were switched out, or something.

I’m considering a move to Dallas next year for work at a children’s hospital and wanted to get a better sense of what daily life in the city is really like from people who live there.

I’m in my mid-20s and coming from abroad, so I’d really appreciate honest perspectives on a few things that matter to me:

* Which areas are popular with young professionals? Any neighborhoods you’d strongly recommend (or avoid)?
* How realistic is it to live without a car at first? Is public transportation usable day-to-day, or is a car pretty essential?
* How affordable does Dallas feel for someone early in their career? Any costs that surprised you?
* How would you describe the restaurant and coffee culture? Are there good international food options?
* Are there recreational sports leagues (volleyball, pickleball), gyms, or outdoor activities people enjoy?
* What’s the general vibe for people in their 20s–30s? How’s the nightlife and social scene?
* How intense is the summer heat in practice, and how do people adjust their routines around it?
* Are there parts of the city that feel especially livable or less so for newcomers?

How do I even begin this story without it turning into an analysis of my ex-boyfriend or my own mental state? A few things to mention first: we met on a dating app and had a really long, nice phone call. People often tell me that I rush into things and that I am pretty naive. He is two years older than me, and due to an injury as well as other past poor decisions, he decided not to return to school for an unknown amount of time to finish his degree.

He pressured me into dating him. I wanted to take things slower, but he kept asking and reassuring me that everything would be better if we just committed. Eventually, I did, reluctantly, because of how fast everything was moving. I met his friends and family very early on, which shocked me given the speed of the relationship. We became increasingly intimate. We took some time before having penetrative sex, and I am only sharing this because it is anonymous, but I had sexual trauma and still do. We worked through it slowly, though we were both very physically drawn to each other. We could not keep our hands off each other, and it is important to note that he lived in the same apartment as his mother.

As time passed, it became difficult to adjust to a dynamic where it felt like everyone had a say in our relationship. At times, I could overhear him complaining about spending money, even though he had been nonchalant about it during our first few dates. I was transparent about my situation. I was focused on studying, wanted to go to grad school, and relied mostly on my parents financially. Eventually, because I was constantly at his mother’s apartment and we were having sex all the time, and we only ever left to go on expensive restaurant dates, she lost her patience and kicked me out.

As this tension grew, so did the tension between his friends and me. They rebuked me, accusing me of being stuck-up or asking for too much, even though he never clearly communicated expectations around money or his ability to provide food outside of my campus. I wished he had been clear from the beginning. Was it wrong for me to expect to be fed when all we did for hours was switch between homework and sex while he switched between sex, video games, and alcohol?

At multiple points, he physically grabbed me by the collar to prevent me from leaving when I needed space. I remember breaking a nail while pushing him away because he wanted to get in my face and I just wanted personal space. Those moments made me feel trapped, scared, and completely disrespected.

I kept breaking up with him, and his friends would reach out, convincing me to take him back. I still question why I stayed. Was it because of the sex? Because I fell for him even though everyone told me he was not good for me? Did I attach because of intimacy? Did I convince myself he was the best I would ever do, or did I let him convince me of that?

Eventually, I grew resentful. He wanted constant contact and validation, checked my phone, and expected me to play nice with friends and family who clearly disliked me. Over time, it felt like he wanted me to be both a housewife and the breadwinner. I finally gave up and broke up with him for the eighth time.

To anyone reading this, I really tried. I tried to understand his financial situation, the scars from his only previous relationship, and how his parents’ divorce affected him. I tried to help him, and he tried to help me in his own way. Still, I became borderline suicidal because of how deprioritized and insecure his inconsistency and alcohol-like tendencies made me feel, tendencies that his family and friends enabled.

I love him deeply. But the stress of my major, my family being on my case after finding out about him, and my overall lack of support pushed me to pull the plug. I crashed out badly. I cut up his clothes, cussed him out through messages, lashed out at his friends, and completely lost control again. I drank alcohol, a Celsius, and a Starbucks coffee all together. I am not proud of this.

What I am trying to ask is this: how am I supposed to feel okay or have any sense of self-worth when the one man who treated me with some level of respect still fell miles short of a relationship worth my time and love? I clung to him so tightly that the day before the final breakup, I called him to pick me up just so I could have someone hold me and keep me from hurting myself. I really did love him. Who writes that many love letters to someone and is treated this poorly? I promise I was somewhat transparent about my mental health, but I just told him I wanted him to come pick me up because I needed him to hold me.

**TL;DR:** I met my ex two months ago. The relationship was very tumultuous. I am reflecting on it and wondering how to navigate romantic relationships better, so I don’t keep getting taken advantage of.",1,1766146959.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Discontinued birth control in August, discontinued SSRI/SNRIs in march/april.

Sorry for the long post.

In september I had a day of very loose bowel movements and thought nothing of it as although this is unusual, I do have IBS-C and a very sensitive stomach to things like coffee. However, I did have a sharp pain in my tummy that only lasted for a few seconds. The next day I was sat on the sofa eating food at around 2pm and I had a sudden episode. The room almost “swam” upwards in my vision, my heart began to beat very hard, I felt breathless although able to breathe, and I began to pace and panic. Called 999, went to A&E and my ECG was fine. While it sounds like a panic attack, I am certain it was not. I came home and my vision remained odd, “swimmy”, and I had little appetite. This happened again a week later, although this time it felt more like I needed to lie down and was very lightheaded and limbs felt unusually “light”. Went doctor, stool samples and blood fine. The diarrhoea remained for 2 and a half weeks and I had extreme trapped gas and bloating.

Following this episode my vision remains like this. I have had recurring episodes of the fast heart rate, feeling lightheaded, needing to hold myself. Other symptoms include loose, floating, stools, reduced urgency for the bathroom, effected appetite, pins and needles in hands and feet at times, odd body temperature (eg feeling like my feet are very hot), heightened anxiety, random heart palpitations, stomach cramps (which have gone now, I will explain). About a week after this I began belching, burping (which I never usually do) and feeling pressure/ light pain in my chest. I’ve also had my heart randomly thump and propranolol (was prescribed for anxiety years ago) did not help.

2 months after this episode, still feeling “drunk” and having these symptoms, I ate a takeaway burger. An hour after eating I began to throw up and (tmi so sorry) produce thick liquid orange stool that would not stop. The next day the room was spinning so much and I felt off balance, very ‘light’, and strange, went to A&E, ECG and bloods fine. I could not eat, I was convinced I was dying, and my parents travelled to my Uni city to get me. Since being at home, I have seen a gastroenterologist. My stools also somewhat solidified.

Bloods fine, endo and colonoscopy fine, stool samples fine (including H pylori). However I tested positive for SIBO (do not know which type or exact score). The gastro doctor said that my multi-systemic symptoms are not symptoms of SIBO. Everyone is convinced I’m just having a mental breakdown and that it’s just anxiety, yet I can’t even shower without holding on to the wall.

I began treatment of Amoxicilin for 10 days. Symptoms have not improved, although I had one day (day 6 of treatment) of feeling absolutely normal. Then the weird vision/drunk/off balance feeling came back. A day after finishing my antibiotics (5 days ago) I have developed the most extreme brain fog. I did have it before but this is like nothing I have ever had- I will take a vitamin and forget which one I have taken immediately after.

So on Monday, I followed the gastro doctors orders. He had previously mentioned (before the SIBO result) 10mg of nortripryline. He has attributed my symptoms numerous times to stress, and said this will “calm down my stomach” for a while. I was reluctant to touch this as I had spent months trying to get off SS/NRIs after being on them for 5 years. But I have filled the prescription, and I’m on day 2 of taking them at night. I do feel a bit like there just being thrown at me because no one knows what’s going on and thinks i’m being hysterical.

As of right now feel like it’s heavy to breathe, walking to the bathroom makes me feel so off balance, i am sensitive to light, I can barely think, I get extremely fatigued all the time, And I haven’t been back to University since september. Walking down the street feels like the most disorienting experience so I do not leave the house. When i’ve used an elevator the floor feels like it’s still moving and I have to hold onto something after. I can’t look at the floor when I walk but I also can’t look up or I get too disoriented. My life is actually on hold as of right now and my health anxiety is through the roof. My family are not taking me seriously and obviously I “seem fine” bar major health anxiety, But i am always dramatic and anxious so its a bit of a boy who cried wolf situation.

I am literally terrified of what is happening to me. I’ve tried to stop thinking about it or be normal but I can’t. I can’t even look around the room without being reminded of what is going on so i just lie in bed all day and I hate having to walk around or leave the house because I feel so so off. Dizzy isn’t the word, it’s like i’m going to faint any second and my eyes are really tired?

I believe my bloods checked my thyroid, B12. I did actually have a blood test in summer before all this which found low folate but clearly that’s not flagged up since. I should also mention I had a very stressful summer and nearly lost a parent who has recovered now, and this all started days into me moving back to uni and away from that situation. I am somewhat wondering if these are extremely delayed ssri withdrawals but I want to rule out a physical / neuro issue

Thank you so much to anyone who answers.

1pqjp2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pqjp2l/in_a_new_relationship_but_not_over_my_ex/,In a new relationship but not over my ex,"So my ex and I dated for nearly 8 years in our early 20s. We ended things when I had been planning on taking a solo travel around the country. (We had talked about doing it together for years but it came down to that he did not want to and I did). So we ended things. It was really tough and a bittersweet end but was the right thing to do at the time. After a few months of no contact and I was visiting town, we met up and had very intense conversations about our relationship and he was more vulnerable than I had ever seen him. However, I was still in the midst of my travels and was not moving back. We would have a phone call each month for the following couple of months but usually ended with me having to close contact because it hurt to be in a limbo. I ended up meeting someone on the road (after 10 months of being broken up with my ex) and that felt really good and exciting. 

After 4-5 months of dating the new person, I decided to move to his town, across the country from my home state and my ex. It's been a year and a half with my new boyfriend and about 2 years and some change since my ex and I broke up. Ever since I settled in my new town with my current boyfriend I find it impossible not to think of my ex. I am still good friends with his sister so I hear about him from time to time. (Good things, he has gotten a new job, done some traveling) 

Its been so tough because my current boyfriend is really a great partner but I just don't feel like I am fully engaged because I have these ""what ifs"" about my ex. Now I am in my home town and have a strong urge to reach out to my ex to meet for coffee and see how he is or gain some clarity. I have learned he began dating recently and part of me knows that was where everything felt more real - like I might lose him forever. But is that for the best?​

Either way I feel none of this is fair to my current boyfriend. I can't understand why I still have such a strong pull to my ex. I have gone to therapy, done cord cutting rituals and endless reflection. Any advice or thoughts are so appreciated. Thanks for reading. ​​",1,1766146713.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
