The goal isn’t novelty, but portability — real coffee flavour in a format that doesn’t require refrigeration.

I’m trying to pressure-test whether this format would ever make sense to people who care about coffee quality.

A few honest questions:  
• Would texture alone be a dealbreaker?  
• Would you see this as coffee, dessert, or neither?  
• Is portability even a real problem for coffee drinkers?

I’m looking for critical feedback, not validation.

NOT SELF PROMOTING   
  
  
We've been working on a project called **Nook**. It’s a minimalist, live guide to the city's best cafes for working, studying, or just chilling. We noticed that Google Maps doesn't really tell you if a place is too loud for a meeting or if it has good lighting for reading, so We trying to fix that.

**The Goal:** A live hub where we can see which cafes are active, check-in when we’re there, and share real-time feedback on the food and environment.

**We need your help with two things:**

1. **Hidden Gems:** Which soulful spots am I missing in Napier Town, Vijay Nagar, or Civil Lines?
2. **Features:** Wen are adding a ""Join Me"" check-in system so people can find study buddies. What else would actually be useful for you?

We've already had about 130 people check out the early version, and we want to make sure the locations are 100% accurate before the full launch.

She was very attractive and fit let’s say so I was kinda into her.

While I’m helping her, she’s being pretty flirty first. Complimenting me, sticking around longer than she needed to, asking little personal questions.

I told her she looked good, she’s smiling, laughing at everything I say, touching my arm when she talks and kinda dragging me to come to her. It felt mutual.

So I flirted back. Nothing insane, I wasn’t being gross or anything. Just matching her energy. Before she left I asked if she’d maybe want to grab coffee sometime.

That’s when she goes, kinda laughing, “I don’t know if my niece would like that.” And I’m like… what? Turns out my 21F coworker is her niece. I genuinely had zero clue before that moment and my coworker was on break when her aunt walked in. (Probably why she was there in the first place)

If I’d known, I probably wouldn’t have gone there just out of respect but the aunt has come in a few times since and she still flirts. Same vibes. Smiling, long eye contact, standing close, all of that. It doesn’t feel one-sided.

But now my coworker is PISSED. She went on this whole rant about how I’m gross for hitting on her aunt in her 50s and that I keep giving her “fuck me” eyes across the store (her words). She’s acting like I crossed some massive line.

Traveling to the other side of the city was tough. She had chosen another drinking establishment herself, but the friend who had snapped her wanted to meet her there.

“It is the hottest bar of today,” Remy said, while Sarah frowned at the holographic version of him in front of her. 

“It is already hot enough today,” she retorted, but he only laughed.

“I’ll be there in about an hour. Need to drop off the kids with Auntie Bee.”

“She is still alive?”

“No no, it is a business. The one we called Auntie Bee is actually called Melissa. I found out when I went there for Charlie.”

“Really?” Sarah put the earphones a bit deeper into her ear, “I clearly miss all the good stuff.”

“I will tell you more when we meet,” Remy laughed.   

Sarah said ‘see you soon’ and turned off her holopad. 



The busbug, a name for the multi limbed busses they used all over the city to climb the many sky scrapers, did not arrive for another thirty minutes so she decided to take the tram. The station was a bit older and most of the benches needed repair. Sarah sat down and took her earphones. She tapped her holopad on and went through her social media. The music had gone out of her earphones, something that happened every now and then and it was not fixable anymore. The other ear could not be muffled from the sound of the tram which had arrived. It was packed, even at that hour. Grumpily Sarah put the volume all the way up while she stepped inside. She had to stand for the entire journey, something she disliked about the city. 



The bar, which was called ‘The Seascape’ had many windows to let in the natural light. Aquariums surrounded the sitting area, filled with many aquatic plants. There were no fish, but Sarah noticed a little prawn cleaning a nearby rock. The room smelled of citrus and coffee.

A robot in the form of an octopus was placed in the corner,  a big rack of different spirits lining up behind it and a bar in front. His many arms flew in and out the cabinet, shaking and stirring different cocktails and placing the finished drinks on the cold metal bar. Human waiters were serving coffee and tea and other drinks to the patrons who sat further away. Sarah looked for a place to sit. It was not too busy at the moment, which she preferred. 



She caught two women near her talking about the current mayor.

“They have given the weather more leniency because of those sunset activists,” one of the women snubbed, “I really don’t understand why they are like this.” 

“If they are so stoked on watching a sunset, they could go to the countryside. They let the weather go lose  there all the time,” the other one replied while sipping from her bright yellow juice, “I don’t know how they can plan their days if they do not know what the weather will be like.”

“I just hope the Body is deciding to repair the greenhouse sector of the Japlin crossing. The bees are confused and my Harvees already got less yield.”



Sarah noticed a man in a suit, standing outside the bar and looking in. He was scowling at the people inside, or perhaps his own reflection. His eyes had an unnatural glow, but he turned away looking for something in his pocket.

 At the bar a man sat hunched against the metal. His bare back showed the hole he had recently paid for at some tattoo shop.  It was healing, waiting for whatever he wanted to get inserted later. Other tables were filled with couples, small families or single patrons like her. 



Sarah found a table near the center of the room and sat down. One of the servers, who was missing the back of her head and decorated the gap with a silver spiderweb, came to her.

“What will it be?” she asked shortly.

“Hi, can I have a shortberry lemonade?” Sarah asked. She was almost certain they would not have them here, but she hoped to be wrong nonetheless. 

“Shortberries are banned from the city,”the waitress replied, “too many overgrowing risks.” She looked around, waiting for Sarah to pick something else. Sarah looked at the menu, scanning it but not finding the right thing. There was nothing with the word lemonade on there. It all had fancy names and equally fancy descriptions.

“We have strawberry flavor,” she said after a long pause.

“Oh okay. Strawberry lemonade please,” Sarah answered.  The waitress nodded and asked some further questions before she left.

Sarah was distracted by another patron who just entered. Her third arm stuck out from between her small chest, a weird place to create that third arm and a definite hint on what her profession was. At the farm Sarah usually worked, most workers had an extra pair of arms to deal with the harvest more efficiently. They spread along their backs like fleshy wings, but they were so useful. Together with the harvesters they could get the work done much quicker. 

While in thought and waiting for her lemonade, she felt a shock going through the bench she was sitting on. She turned her head to see who it was. She had a couple of friends in the city, maybe one of them sneaked up on her.



The man was big and broad. His square jaw was lined with miniscule dark silver nodes. On a sunny day like this, he was wearing a heavy woven coat, hiding his arms in the dark. He looked like an old android. From a model Sarah had not seen before. 



Sarah instantly moved away from him. Robots who looked like robots were fine. People who had some modifications were weird but it was the trend. But androids, they were banned since the last uprising. And an android had killed her parents. 

The android looked at her with his blue eyes, that were a little too bright to be human, thought Sarah. His brown hair almost reached his shoulders. He looked at her as if he expected an answer.

“Exuse me, may I require why you are sitting next to me?” Sarah huffed.

The android did not react immediately. He bowed towards her, which made Sarah crawl away from him. 

“I need you to get down, please,” he said softly, but with a deep voice

“What?” Sarah raised her voice. How dared he, giving her orders.

Before he could repeat his sentence, a gunshot rang through the room grazing Sarah’s ear.",1,1771676604.0,SarahandtheStranger,0,1.0,False

1raprpc,https://i.redd.it/uhtrty47bukg1.png,"Inflation, AI and the Return of Political Chaos: Notes from the Executive Panic Room","Not long ago, the world’s executives were united by a single shared hobby: worrying about inflation. Boardrooms sounded less like strategy hubs and more like group therapy sessions for people traumatised by rising energy bills and the price of printer ink.

Then, almost overnight, inflation stopped being *the* crisis and became merely *a* crisis — the business equivalent of that colleague who still causes problems but no longer gets their own emergency meeting.

# Phase One: The Great Inflation Obsession

In the immediate post-Covid years, inflation was treated with the reverence usually reserved for volcanic eruptions or the England men’s football team during a penalty shootout. Surveys suggested roughly four in ten CEOs viewed it as a top threat. Entire strategies were built around hedging, pricing, and the subtle art of charging more while pretending nothing had changed.

Companies eventually adapted. Finance teams became amateur economists. Procurement departments developed the survival instincts of Victorian explorers. And executives learned that “dynamic pricing” is just a polite way of saying, “Brace yourself.”

Inflation didn’t disappear — it simply lost its starring role. The executive anxiety machine needed a new lead character.

# Phase Two: Generative AI Becomes the Office Messiah

Enter generative AI: part technological revolution, part corporate mid-life crisis.

By 2023, technology shifts had leapfrogged inflation on the executive priority list. Suddenly every board deck contained the word “AI” in a font size usually reserved for emergency exits. Roughly 70% of CEOs claimed it would fundamentally reshape how value is created — which is corporate language for “we’re not entirely sure what this does yet, but it looks expensive and we’d like some.”

The reality has been delightfully British in its understatement. Only a small minority of leaders say AI has delivered clear revenue and cost benefits so far. Many organisations are still experimenting, which mostly means giving a chatbot access to internal documents and hoping it doesn’t invent a new HR policy.

Still, the hype machine rolls on. Companies are hiring “prompt engineers”, rebranding old analytics projects as “AI initiatives”, and holding innovation workshops that feel suspiciously like last year’s digital transformation meetings with better buzzwords.

# Phase Three: Politics Kicks the Door In

Just as executives began to master the art of nodding thoughtfully during AI demos, geopolitics barged back onto the agenda like an uninvited guest at a Christmas party.

Political disruption — tariffs, trade tensions, regulatory surprises — has surged up risk rankings. The re-election of Donald Trump has only added to the atmosphere, prompting companies to re-examine supply chains with the urgency of someone checking whether they left the iron on.

One in five CEOs now believe tariff risks alone could hit them financially. Which means somewhere, right now, a strategy consultant is building a slide titled “Scenario Planning Framework 4.0” while executives pretend they weren’t hoping geopolitics would stay quietly in the background.

# Meanwhile, Somewhere Between the Boardroom and Reality…

Here’s the bit executives don’t always admit: these shifting priorities don’t land evenly across an organisation. While the C-suite debates AI strategy and geopolitical exposure, middle managers are quietly trying to translate abstract ambition into something that resembles actual work.

The result is a widening collaboration gap — and a rather British flavour of workplace anxiety.

At the top, leaders talk about transformation, resilience and “strategic optionality”. In the middle, managers hear: *new tools, unclear expectations, fewer people, and another reporting dashboard*. Executives worry about long-term competitiveness; middle managers worry about whether the AI pilot will break the weekly workflow five minutes before a deadline.

Inflation made everyone nervous in the same way — rising costs are at least a shared language. But technology shifts and political uncertainty create different emotional climates.



* **C-suite anxiety** tends to be existential: market disruption, shareholder pressure, regulatory risk.
* **Middle-manager anxiety** is operational: changing processes, skills gaps, team morale and the subtle fear of being replaced by a chatbot that doesn’t take annual leave.



Generative AI has amplified this divide. Senior leaders often see opportunity — efficiency, innovation, new revenue streams. Managers, meanwhile, see a flood of new expectations without a matching instruction manual. The board asks for “rapid adoption”; the middle layer wonders who exactly is supposed to run the training while also delivering quarterly targets.

Then geopolitics adds another twist. Strategic decisions made at the top — reshoring supply chains, shifting markets, revising compliance rules — cascade downward as restructures, new KPIs and last-minute changes to priorities. Collaboration becomes harder because everyone is anxious about different things at different altitudes of the corporate ladder.

In short, the executive narrative says, “We must reinvent ourselves.” The middle-manager reality says, “We must reinvent ourselves by Tuesday.”

# The Modern Executive Lifestyle

Today’s corporate leader must juggle three existential threats at once:



* Inflation, which refuses to leave but has stopped shouting.
* Generative AI, which promises to do everything except explain itself clearly.
* Political disruption, which can rewrite business models faster than you can say “trade war”.



Nearly half of CEOs think their companies may not survive the next decade without significant reinvention. This sounds dramatic, but it also explains why every strategy off-site now includes a workshop called “Reimagining the Future”, followed by lukewarm coffee and existential dread.

# A Very Serious Conclusion (Delivered with a Straight Face)

The executive priority list has evolved from “How do we survive inflation?” to “Will AI replace us?” to “What did the latest election just do to our supply chain?” — often all within the same quarterly earnings call.

But beneath the humour sits a real tension: the faster the external world changes, the wider the emotional and operational gap grows between the C-suite and the middle of the organisation. Leaders chase transformation; managers chase clarity.

If there is a lesson here, it’s that corporate fear moves in trends — but organisational anxiety accumulates. Yesterday’s crisis becomes tomorrow’s footnote, and the people tasked with making strategy real are left navigating the space between ambition and ambiguity.

On the bright side, at least inflation is no longer the only reason anyone can’t sleep. It now shares the bed with a chatbot, a geopolitical briefing and a middle manager updating a slide deck at 11pm — which, in modern business terms, counts as alignment.

What I haven’t liked is the taxes on things like steel and aluminum and coffee beans and so on, because those really have had a negative impact on the economy.”

Moore said, “[O]n the one hand, … those tariffs have had a negative effect on many medium-sized business[es] and small businesses, some retailers, manufacturers have really been hurt by the tariffs, and so — and I’ve never been a big fan of tariffs. On the other hand, one of the negative repercussions of this decision, Jake, will be the fact that Trump has been a kind of master negotiator with some of these other countries, whether it’s China, Japan, Canada, the Europeans, in using the threat of these tariffs to get other countries to play by the rules, to reduce their tariffs on American goods and services, and to bring hundreds of billions of dollars of capital into the United States.

I've been using Claude Desktop for a while and I got tired of spending 7-8 hours every month manually filling out expense reports in Spendesk. Custom fields, VAT rates, hunting for invoices across 15 different supplier portals… anyone who uses Spendesk knows the pain.

So I built a plugin that does all of it automatically.

**What it does:**

* Opens your Spendesk dashboard and reads all pending payments
* Batch-fills mandatory custom fields (cost center, category, GL account) via API — not clicks, actual API calls, so it's fast
* Configures VAT correctly based on supplier location (intra-EU reverse charge, French domestic, non-EU out of scope)
* Searches your email for matching invoices and uploads them to the right transactions
* Falls back to supplier billing portals when email doesn't have the receipt

**The workflow:** You literally type `/spendesk all` in Claude Desktop, go make coffee, and come back to a clean Spendesk dashboard. What used to take me 2+ hours now takes about 8 minutes.

**Some numbers from my own usage:**

* 47 transactions processed in one run
* 0 manual corrections needed on VAT
* 3 invoices it couldn't find automatically (niche suppliers with weird billing systems)

I packaged it as a plugin you can install in one click. Happy to answer any questions about the technical approach or how it handles edge cases. Also open to feedback if anyone wants to test it.

*Works with any Spendesk organization. Requires Claude Desktop with Chrome extension (Claude in Chrome). Auto-detects your org from the URL.*

I’m a domestic (U.S.) applicant for Fall 2026 CS PhD programs.I applied to 19 schools (mostly top schools) this year. I completed both my B.S. and M.S. in South Korea at one of the top universities there.

In total, I’ve published 12 papers: 1 first-author paper at a top-tier conference, 2 first-author papers at major Korean conferences, 9 co-authored papers (most at top-tier conferences)

I also have 2 patents currently pending.

So far, I’ve had 3 interviews:

* **Yale** – I met a professor in person at a conference and even had a coffee chat. The professor told me I could join the lab, but I received a department-level rejection last week. I honestly felt betrayed.
* **UIUC** – Interviewed on 12/24 and haven’t heard anything since.
* **Georgia Tech** – Interviewed on 1/30 and was told I would hear back in mid-February, but I still haven’t received any updates.

I haven’t received any other interview invitations. Also, I got official rejections from 7 schools (not UIUC and GaTech) so far.

If I don’t get admitted to UIUC or Georgia Tech, does that basically mean my cycle is over?

I had 3 interviews, but I’m so anxious that I’ll get rejected from all of them that I can’t even sleep. I’d really appreciate any insight or advice.",0,1771675413.0,gradadmissions,0,0.5,False

While it’s true I had some experience, as it had been nearly five years since I graduated from the police academy, during that time we handled various distress calls sent to the base.



​The night shift is intriguing, even filled with suspense; there’s no doubt this job is dangerous at any hour, for as the saying goes, crime never sleeps. But when the sun goes down and night blankets the city, between bizarre shadows and mocking laughter, all kinds of spectacles unfold: fights in filthy alleys, drunks making a scene in public, domestic disputes... many began with the phrase ""Daddy is hitting Mommy"" and ended with a grieving mother.



​Thieves slipping through the shadows to commit their crimes; if the victim was lucky, we’d assist before tragedy struck. These days, I don’t know what the hell is wrong with people: some blame the government for failing to provide, others blame parents for not raising the child to avoid punishing the adult.



​In reality, everyone is a victim of their own mistakes, and circumstances often play a major role; sometimes collateral damage triggers a whirlwind of emotions that form a circle of tragedies. Despite it all, through days, weeks, and years, my partner and I patrolled every night with the same recurring mysteries, falling into a routine that was quite practical and, if I dare say, even boring.
​But that rainy night in August would change our lives forever.



​It all began like any other shift. The alarm went off at 7 p.m.; five years of the same routine meant a single beep was enough to put me on alert. I turned on the shower; as I did, the delicious aroma of pasta flooded my nostrils. I let my sense of smell guide me toward the source.



​I left the room without hesitation, bewitched by the scent of tomato sauce and Italian herbs. In an instant, I was in front of the oven, where that delicacy rested, giving off warm, soft notes. I looked around to make sure no one was watching, but before I could reach for the handle, a voice behind me made me jump.




​""Don't you even think about opening that oven,"" she exclaimed, then added: ""I think I’ll have to arrest you.""



​It was the sweetest voice in the world. Viviana, my wife. We had been married for four years but had known each other since high school. We didn’t have children yet; she was still finishing her studies, and we had agreed to wait until we both had stable jobs.



​""What am I being charged with, officer?"" I replied with a smirk.



​""Trespassing in the kitchen and attempted theft,"" she said, walking slowly toward me. Before I could say a word, she silenced me with her kisses.



​There’s no doubt that from the moment I met her, I knew she was the perfect woman. Her lips sparked the same sensation as our first kiss; I don't know if it was that strawberry-flavored lipstick or simply the love we felt. I began to run my fingertips up her back beneath her blouse, feeling every fold of her skin until I slowly reached her waist. I could feel her ragged breath; how her skin prickled as my lips began to devour her long, smooth neck.



​Just as we were about to merge our bodies into one, as if it were a cruel joke, the oven timer went off.



​""The pasta!"" she cried out, pushing me aside. ""Honey, you left the shower running and you’re going to be late.""



​Putting on her oven mitts, she gave me one last kiss as she pulled out the tray.



​""Dinner is ready.""



​Minutes after a hot shower, I was tasting the last bite. I gathered my things and prepared to leave, not without saying goodbye with a kiss; she wished me a quiet shift so I could return home.



​I left in a hurry. As I headed to the car, I noticed dark clouds covering the sky, which was drowning in the twilight. Within minutes, I was at the station, greeting colleagues finishing their shifts and those starting with me.



​In the locker room, I hurried to fix my uniform when I noticed my partner’s absence. I was staring at the void of his lonely locker when I was interrupted.



​""Officer Roberto Solís called in sick,"" I heard a familiar voice. Before I could react, it added: ""Santoyo will be riding with you tonight, Officer Muñiz.""



​It was Captain Mendoza. Rogelio Mendoza had a short career, coming from a long family tradition. It took him only two years to leave the gritty streets and become a homicide detective—a fast promotion, though many felt it was unearned. Before his detractors could even process it, he took over the captaincy. Many thought it was the Mendoza genes, but in twelve years in charge, there have been more inconsistencies than results.



​His inefficiency and arrogance moved him away from his long-awaited goal. The new commissioner arrived as a transfer from a neighboring state: a direct blow to his ego. We were in the briefing room listening to the orders.



​""Alright, gentlemen. We’ve been informed of a group of youths vandalizing the mall, specifically the loading docks. Kids between seventeen and nineteen with skateboards, spray cans, and apparently, illegal substances. Act with caution. There are no reports of weapons, but kids are crazy these days; take extreme precautions.""



​Silence filled the room.



​""Last point,"" he continued. ""Neighbors claim the old hospital has been overrun by addicts and is functioning as a dealing spot. Sector H, patrolled by Muñiz and Officer Santoyo. Same recommendations: take extreme precautions. Most of these junkies are capable of killing for a dose. Don't let your guard down.""



​Without further questions, we boarded patrol car 1077. The rain began to fall, and within minutes, a downpour flooded the deserted streets. We patrolled for a couple of hours in a silence broken only by the dispatcher reporting blackouts. I enjoyed the sound of the rain and the comfortable silence. Past midnight, the storm turned into a steady drizzle; enough to justify a stop.



​""Large Americano with one cream,"" I told Santoyo as he crossed the parking lot.



​I took the chance to message Roberto Solís: ""What happened, brother? Everything okay?""


 I watched the screen, but there was no reply. I considered calling, but given the hour, I let it go. Santoyo reappeared, and the delicious aroma of freshly roasted coffee filled the car.



​""Damn rain,"" he muttered. ""The girl inside says it’s going to keep up all night.""



​""Yeah, it’s going to be a wet one,"" I replied.
​We continued patrolling the cold, wet pavement, sharing stories and jokes. The laughter died down when the early morning silence was shattered by an emergency call:



​""Attention, a fight is reported near the hospital. Suspects are a male and a female who apparently wounded the victim with a blade.""



​Santoyo responded as the car accelerated and the sirens broke the peace of the asphalt jungle.


​""Patrol 1077 en route. We are within the perimeter, a few blocks away on Fifth and Magistrados. Over.""



​""Copy. Use extreme caution, suspects are armed and dangerous. Repeat: suspects are armed and dangerous,"" the dispatcher concluded.



​I shifted into third and accelerated. My heart was racing, my mouth felt dry. I looked over at Santoyo and noticed his nervousness.



​""Everything okay?""



​""Yeah... it’s just, I’ve been on the force for nine months and the only time I’ve drawn my weapon was to clean it. I haven’t even been to the range since the academy. I was in monitoring when I asked Captain Mendoza if I could help with anything else. He assigned me to you until Solís returns.""



​I realized I had two problems: a pair of potentially drugged attackers and, on the other hand, the ""camera guy"" who hadn't fired a shot in a year.


​""Keep your eyes peeled. If you make eye contact, keep your distance. Most importantly: you fire only if your life is at risk.""



​He nodded, the nervousness evident in his eyes.



​""People high on drugs with a weapon are capable of killing without a second thought,"" I continued, ""but if we handle this right, nobody has to get hurt.""



​We turned toward the hospital. The sky was falling apart; it was impossible to see through the deluge. Still, as we got closer, we spotted a silhouette in the storm. It was running toward us. Realizing we were there, the figure stopped dead and, with surprising agility, scaled the fence.

Wyatt - how old is the ship” 

Phorantis

In the vast, star-speckled expanse of the Principality’s outer rim, Phorantis Station orbited like a vigilant sentinel over the lush world below. The planet’s forests cast an ethereal glow upward, painting the station’s underbelly in shifting hues of green and violet.

Phorantis Station was a hub of commerce and chaos, where traders from a hundred worlds bartered, bickered, and occasionally brawled. At its heart was Vicky Staples, the docking and transit lane administrator who kept the whole orbiting circus from spinning into disaster.

Vicky was 46 now, slim and wiry, standing just under two meters tall—a height that let her look most species in the eye without craning her neck. Her hair was blue these days, a vibrant eastern bluebird, that caught the station lights like a comet’s tail.

Like most women who’d spent decades in the black, she changed colors with her moods or milestones: fiery red in her fiery youth, stark black during the hard years after Titus’s father lost his life to pirates . His real mother—Vicky’s best friend and employer—had pressed the infant into her arms on a burning ship, whispering, “Raise him as your own,” before pirates took her forever.

A brief golden blonde phase had followed when optimism flickered back, but blue suited her now—cool, commanding, a reminder that she was still navigating the void’s unpredictable currents. She wore it normally in a ponytail , practical for zero-g drills, framing a face etched with laugh lines and the faint scar of an old station accident.

From her control booth / office , Vicky watched the United Earth Transport Botany Bay ease into Bay 7 docking slip. The ship was a relic, over a century old by Earth’s standards, her hull a testament to human stubbornness: blocky, battle-scarred, and powered by a slip drive that folded space faster than the Principality’s clunky FTL systems ever could. As promised, this Botany Bay carried echoes of Earth itself. Vicky pulled up the records: this ship had docked here six times in the last 80 years. Most likely many more after she is  gone.

A stasis ship for long hauls

The manifest scrolled across her screen: medicinal supplies for the clinic, crates of Black Rifle Coffee with its bold, no-frills roast, bottles of Knob Creek Bourbon aged in charred oak, fine China dinner sets with intricate porcelain patterns, crystal glassware that rang like chimes, actual paper books bound in leather and pulp, exotic spices, vintage Earth wines, and even a shipment of heirloom seeds for Phorantis’ hydroponic farms. Earth things—tangible, nostalgic, the kind that made aliens pause and humans homesick.

The comm crackled, and the video display lit up. A tall man with black hair with just a touch of silver , a squared jawline, and a warm smile filled the screen. “Phorantis Control, this is Harry of the Botany Bay. Berth request for a week layover. Cargo’s secure, ship’s humming, and I’ve got enough Earth goodies to bribe a bureaucrat or two.”

Vicky smirked, leaning into her mic. “Copy, Harry. Berth 7 locked. Inspection in fifteen. Your slip wake’s leaving residue—expect a surcharge.”

A chuckle, warm and roguish, rolled back. He leaned closer to the camera, eyes twinkling as he took in her image. What was it now—ten years in stasis? How many more before I retire? “Vicky, darlin’, you drive a hard bargain. But with hair like that blue streak, I’d say you’re worth the extra credits. See you on the ramp.”

She rolled her eyes but felt a spark of amusement. Pilots were all talk, but this one had a voice like aged bourbon—smooth with a kick. But this one an Earth one  most likely.  Then she saw him smile, and the realization hit like a cold vacuum breach: that smile was the same as Winston’s—Titus’s father. The memory rushed over her: the day the pirates hit, Winston dying in the corridor, her best friend / employer pressing the screaming infant into Vicky’s arms “ saying Vicky raise him as your’s “  before vanishing into the black forever. She blinked it away, focusing on the docking readouts.

Down on the ramp, Harry waited: tall , slim  mid-fifties, with a salt-and-pepper beard and eyes that twinkled like navigation beacons. His uniform was casual, jacket open over a faded Earth tee, carrying himself with the easy confidence of a man who’d outrun pirates and outhaggled merchants across the stars.

Vicky approached, tablet in hand. “Manifest matches. Emissions at 20% over—1,000 credit fine, plus 6k daily docking for the week.”

She handed him the tablet. His fingers brushed hers—deliberate?—and she felt a spark, electric and unexpected. “Careful with that touch,” she teased, pulling back with a wry smile. “Might add a handling fee.”

Harry whistled low, his grin widening. “Ouch. That’s steeper than a black hole’s pull. But if every fine comes with a spark like that, sign me up. Come aboard, see what I’ve got. Maybe we can… negotiate.”

She followed him into the hold, crates towering like ancient monoliths. He cracked one open: fine China, porcelain plates with floral gold rims, crystal goblets sparkling under the lights. “Earth’s best. Handmade, fragile as a first date.”

Vicky’s fingers traced a plate, her mind drifting to Titus—her son, now at the Guild Trading Station—who was deep in love with Kelly. Their romance had been blooming toward marriage for about  a year now, since that first video call where Kelly stood beside him , eyes bright. Vicky wanted something special for their new life together . Fine dining ware would be perfect—elegant, enduring.

She met Harry’s gaze. “This set—twelve places. Retail?”

“Twenty-five hundred,” he said, stepping closer, voice dropping flirty. “But for a woman with eyes as sharp as yours and hair that makes the stars jealous, maybe we can talk discounts.”

Vicky crossed her arms, hiding a smile. “Flattery’s free, but docking fees aren’t. Waive the emissions and two days’ fees, I’ll take it at 1,800.”

Harry leaned against a crate, grinning. “You’re a pirate in admin clothing. Deal—if you join me for dinner tonight. Station’s best spot. My treat.”

She considered, wondering how long in stasis he’d spent this time, as they exited the ship. He was interesting—charming without being sleazy, with stories etched in his laugh lines. “One dinner and a story about Earth. And no more surcharges.”

“Deal sealed,” he said, winking. “But let’s make it two stories if the bourbon flows right.”

As they shook on it, a klaxon blared: incoming passenger transport. The sleek liner docked in Bay 8, ramp extending. Two figures disembarked—Edward Russell and Kate Adams, packs slung over shoulders, looking relaxed in civilian clothes.

Edward, tall and bearded, spotted the Botany Bay first. “No way. Botany Bay? As in the old Earth convict ship? Or the one from those ancient vids with the superhuman Khan?”

Kate, compact and fierce with her hair tied back, laughed. “Both, probably. Such humor at best. Naming a hauler after exiles—bold or bad luck?”

Edward snorted. “We’re all prisoners of the void anyway. Come on, let’s see if it’s got coffee or something to trade worth the name.”

They approached, spotting Vicky and Harry. “Vicky!” Kate called, hugging her. “Been how many years—eight, ten?”

“Eight and a touch more,” Vicky replied, hugging back tightly. “You two look ready to unwind.”

“And…” Kate pointed at Harry. “New pilot?”

“Harry,” he introduced, shaking hands. “You two look like you’ve seen some action.”

Edward nodded. “Edward Russell, this is Kate Adams. We’re on a three-week vacation from the Guild Trading Station.”

Kate grinned. “Chasing echoes got old; needed real R&R. Your ship’s a legend—I never dreamed I’d see one carrying the name.”

Harry chuckled. “Flattery from void chasers? I’m honored. Come aboard—samples of Black Rifle and Knob Creek waiting.”

Edward perked up. “You have any cigars on this ship you’d part with?”

Harry raised an eyebrow. “One hundred credits a box sealed from Earth ”

Edward didn’t hesitate. “I’ll take two.”

The two women watched in awe as Edward brokered the deal like he was at a market stall. “Men and their toys,” Kate muttered, shaking her head with a laugh.

Vicky approached Edward quietly. “I believe you know my son.” Edward Russel correct.

Edward blinked, realization dawning. “Titus. Yes.” He thought of the connections, the shared histories. “Good kid. You did good.”

Vicky smiled , Kate added, “Three-week vacation. I’ll reach out before you leave.”

Edward and Kate smiled back. “We’d like that. Maybe share some void stories over coffee.about Titus ”

Vicky smiling I would enjoy that .

And Edward thank you as you are spoken very highly from my friends as well .

Edward nodding saying we better catch a ride .

The week unfolded with humor, banter, and unexpected warmth between Vicky and Harry.

Day 1

Dinner at the cantina. Harry regaled Vicky with Earth tales—dodging asteroids, outsmarting customs. “You know, with that blue hair, you look like a siren from old myths. Luring pilots to their doom with fees.”

Vicky laughed, swirling her bourbon. “And you’re the rogue captain, charming his way out. Pass the Knob Creek—let’s see if it’s as smooth as your lines.”

He poured, eyes twinkling. “Careful. One sip and you might forget the surcharge entirely.”

She took a sip, savoring the warmth. “Not likely. But keep talking—your stories are better than station gossip.”

They lingered over the meal, Harry sharing tales of distant ports, Vicky opening up about the challenges of raising Titus alone. “He’s grown into a fine man,” she said softly. “Kelly’s good for him.”

Harry nodded. “Sounds like love’s got him hooked. Jealous—wish I had that stability.”

Vicky tilted her head. “Stasis life must be lonely. How do you cope?”

“With good bourbon and better company,” he replied, his gaze lingering. The evening ended with a promise of more talks, the flirtation light but building.

Day 2

Banter flew in the hold as they unloaded crates. Harry teased Vicky about her “pirate admin” style. “You’d make a fine captain yourself. Blue hair waving like a flag on the bridge.”

She fired back: “Says the man flying a convict-named ship. Planning a prison break?”

He laughed, deep and genuine. “Only if you’re my co-pilot. Admit it—you’re enjoying the chaos.”

Vicky cut a side deal for books for her office library, flirting lightly. “Harry, you’re trouble.”

He winked: “The fun kind. And you could use a little fun, couldn’t you?”

She paused, then smiled. “Maybe I could.”

That afternoon, they shared coffee and good stories

Kate nodded. “And the bourbon? I want to get a bottle for Edward .

Harry grinned. “For friends of Vicky’s? Discount applied.”

Day 3

Second dinner, aboard the Botany Bay this time. Harry had set up a small table in his quarters, dim lights, a spread of Earth spices flavoring station rations. He opened up about solitary runs. “Stasis jumps stretch time thin. Wake up, everything’s changed. Except the loneliness.”

Vicky shared about Titus and Kelly. “My boy’s smitten. Kelly’s grace has him wrapped around her like a throw on a cool night .”

Harry raised his glass. “Like I’m getting smitten with a certain admin.”

Glasses clinked. The banter softened, turning intimate. Harry’s hand found hers across the table. “Vicky, that spark earlier—wasn’t just me, was it?”

She didn’t pull away. “No. It wasn’t.”

The evening deepened. Laughter gave way to touches—his fingers tracing her arm, her hand on his chest. They kissed, slow at first, then with the urgency of two people starved for connection. Vicky stayed over, awakening in his cabin bed the next morning, sheets tangled, his arm around her. Sunlight from the viewport filtered in, casting a warm glow. She stirred, and Harry woke, smiling that familiar smile.

“Morning, blue-hair,” he murmured, pulling her closer.

She laughed softly. “Not bad for a convict ship captain.”

Day 4

Breakfast together in the cabin. Vicky stared at her coffee, wondering how this happened. “Titus is happy. Maybe it’s contagious.” Even if for a brief moment in time. She needed this—a break to let herself enjoy life.

Harry squeezed her hand. “Contagious is good. Let it spread.”

They spent the day tangled in each other, exploring the physical pull that had sparked from the start. Laughter mixed with sighs, banter turning playful under the sheets. “You’re addictive,” he whispered during a quiet moment.

“And you’re leaving soon,” she replied, but without regret—just savoring the now.

Day 5

Vicky took Harry to the surface. Wind on their faces, sun warming skin. They wandered forest paths, hands linked, sharing stolen kisses behind glowing trees. Dinner at her home—not a man in her life for so long. Knowing he’d leave soon, she needed this.

Back in his cabin that night, the intimacy deepened. Bodies entwined, whispers in the dark. “Stay again,” he said.

She did, awakening wrapped in his arms, the void outside forgotten for a while.

Day 6

The first time in years she’d taken days off. They spent it walking the station, exploring each other—stories during meals, physical closeness in quiet corners, nights in his bed where passion blurred the lines between layover and something more. “You make stasis seem bearable,” he admitted one evening, holding her close.

“And you make the station feel alive,” she replied, tracing his jaw.

Day 7

Up at the slip, holding each other. Vicky spotted Animal, the mechanic friend. He gave her a smile and a nod—just that filled her heart with warmth not felt in decades.

Harry had to leave. “My route has us at Volantis in two years. Another stasis jump in two days.”

They kissed, long and lingering, bodies pressing close one last time.

Vicky whispered, “Before you go into stasis, send me the schedule.”

Harry nodded. “I’ll do it before I leave the slip.”

Several hours later, Vicky sat in her office. A ping. Her data pad lit up—a smile crossing her face with a file attached.

Vicky smiled. Maybe a trip back home.

Chapter 1 

When I arrived home with the gift I had carefully chosen for Xander, the house was empty except for a table 

laden with fresh flowers. 

Cheers and laughter drifted from row house garden, and a cold dread settled in my stomach with each step. 

“Don Xander, you are truly blessed, such a fine son and such a lovely Donna,” came the teasing voices of 

Capo from nearby. 

My whole body stiffened, refusing to believe what I had just heard. 

A few more steps, and I saw him. 

Xander was cradling an infant. A voluptuous woman stood beside him, her arm linked through his. 

“Yes, I am. But above all, Stephanie deserves the credit,” he said, his voice dripping with a tenderness I had 

never known. He squeezed her shoulder, and she looked up at him, her face radiant with happiness. 

They looked the perfect family of three, a picture so enviable it made my heart ache. 

I stood frozen, a wretched creature peering in on their celebration. 

Behind them, a banner hung on the wall, 

\\\[Aaron’s Baby Shower\\\] 

Aaron… 

Once, I had clung to Xander, playfully whining, “Xander, I want to give you a son someday. Let’s name him 

Aaron.” 

He’d asked me why. I’d grinned, bright and hopeful. “Doesn’t ‘Aaron‘ sound like a born leader? I want our child to be just like his father, exceptional, reliable, a true leader.” 

And now, the child he had with another woman… was named Aaron. 

“By the way, Xander,” one of his Capos asked, “Tina should be back soon, shouldn’t she? Aren’t you worried 

she’ll make a scene when she finds out you’re a father?” 

Xander gently stroked the baby’s cheek. “I’d nearly forgotten, thanks for the reminder.” 

He immediately took out his phone and called. “Keep Tina abroad a while longer,” he instructed, his voice 

casual. “She’d better not come back now. She’d make a scene if she finds out I have a son.” 

My breath hitched, and I stumbled back one step. 

Chapter 1 

0.75% 

I became a Doctors Without Borders doctor because Xander demanded it three years ago. 

Three years ago, on my birthday, he summoned me to his penthouse. He rarely invited me there, and I was full of anticipation, thinking he had a surprise for me. 

Once I was seated, he set a ring box on the table between us and slid a plane ticket toward me. 

“You don’t belong in a mafia family,” he’d declared. “Go. Work with Doctors Without Borders for three years. Harden your spirit, steady your heart. Then come back ready to be my Donna.” 

He thought me too flighty, prone to crying over every little thing, as an outsider to this world, I lacked the cold composure a Donna needed. He said I even make a scene whenever I saw him with other women. 

“I’ll wait for you,” he had promised. “I’ll welcome you back with the grandest wedding, let all of New York 

know you are my wife, my Donna.” 

I believed him. So, I studied hard, applied, and poured myself entirely into it. 

The day my application was accepted, I was overjoyed. 

I thought if I could just survive those three years, I could become Xander’s Donna. 

But now I was back, and he was a father. 

Coming to my senses, I found my face was wet with tears. The more I wiped them away, the more they fell. 

“I really don’t want her to come back.” 

Chapter 2

Xander spoke the words that would shatter my heart with casual ease, freeing one hand to lace his fingers with the woman beside him.

""From now on, I only want to be with Stephanie. I want us to be happy forever.""

""So sweet! It makes me want to have a baby with my own girlfriend!"" someone cheered.

""But Don,"" another voice chimed in, ""have you thought about how you'll explain this to Tina?""

Hearing my name, his expression hardened instantly. ""I don't intend to let her come back.""

He leaned down to comfort Stephanie, his voice softening again.

""Nick will handle everything. Don't worry. You're the only one by my side.""

Snowflakes drifted down from the sky, landing on the tip of my nose, their chill seeping straight into my heart.

On the day I left three years ago, I had clung to Xander, asking, ""Xander, when I come back… you really will marry me, won't you?""

He had ruffled my hair, his voice as gentle as water. ""Of course I will. By then, you'll have grown steady enough to be the perfect wife.""

""Don't worry. I'll wait for you. You're the only one by my side.""

But now I was steady. And he was with another woman.

Why?

Why did you lie to me?

My chest felt tight and painful. Tears streamed down my face uncontrollably.

In the war zone, treating the wounded under gunfire, the only thought that kept me going was: I have to survive. I have to survive to marry Xander.

Even when I was caught in an explosion, injured, alone, bleeding, freezing, facing death countless times, I held on.

I had only one thought then, Xander was waiting for me. I had to get back to him.

So I applied to return a year early, and today I finally made it back. I had wanted to surprise him.

Instead, he surprised me first.

""Did you hear? Xander bought a yacht. He's going to marry Stephanie on it,"" someone nearby gossiped as they walked past. I quickly hid behind a tree.

""Oh my god, that's so enviable. But what about Tina? Didn't she love him more than anymore?""

""You don't know? Three years ago, he tricked her into going abroad with Doctors Without Borders. Who knows if she's even alive now?""

""Xander just wanted to be with Stephanie, and was afraid Tina would make a scene. That's why he did it.""

""So the moment she left the country, Xander got together with Stephanie right away.""

Their words rang in my ears with crystal clarity.

So Xander had planned all this three years ago. And I, like a fool, believed him.

Conditions in the war zone were harsh, yet I never felt the hardship, for I believed enduring it would lead me back to him, to our marriage.

The group of women walked past me to congratulate Xander.

Suddenly, one of them teased, ""Don Xander, Tina cared for you for so many years. Can you really bear to leave her doing such difficult medical work abroad?""

Xander didn't even lift his eyes. His gaze remained fixed on his son.

""She's the one who cared for me. The feeling was never mutual.""

""If it weren't for my father adopted her and was fond of her, I would have kicked her out of our territory long ago.

You all know she's not from a Mafia family. She was never fit to be Donna. All these years, she's just clung to me.""

I was adopted by the Luciano family at sixteen.

Xander was already twenty-three then, a university graduate and the family's standout heir.

He came from a good family, was handsome, and girls always swarmed around him.

Every time, I would get jealous and say, ""Xander, can't you stay away from other girls?""

Back then, Xander would just laugh and pinch my cheek.

""Tina, whatever you say.""

Chapter 3

Back then, I mistook that for love.

So I kept drawing close to him, learning his interests, trying to mold myself into the girl he would like.

When I turned eighteen, I wore heavy makeup for the first time, mascara, a sexy dress, and high heels.

At a banquet, just because a wealthy young man spoke to me briefly, Xander dragged me into the restroom and kissed me forcefully.

His eyes were pitch black, filled with raw desire. He pressed his forehead to mine and said, ""You are mine.""

In the beginning, it was him who gave me hope, who acted in every way as if he adored me in every way.

And now he claimed I had been the one clinging to him all along.

I left the garden, heartbroken. By the time I reached the front gate, I could no longer hold back my sobs.

With trembling hands, I took out my phone and opened the latest notification. It was a message from Xander,

\\\[Tina bear, happy birthday.\\\]

When I received that message, I was resuscitating a pregnant woman. I was covered in blood, hadn't slept in a day and a night, but seeing his words filled me with renewed strength.

Wiping my tears, I tapped the voice call button and dialed his number.

""T? What's wrong?"" Xander's voice came through the phone, gentle as ever.

He must have found somewhere quiet to answer, because it had rung for a long time before he picked up.

I tried to speak, but my mind was flooded with the image of him holding that baby, standing with another woman.

""Tina bear?"" he prompted again.

He had always called me 'Tina bear.' I used to love that nickname. Now, it suddenly made me feel sick.

""Xander, I'm back in New York.""

If he listened carefully, he might have heard the slight tremor in my voice. But Xander didn't notice anything amiss. He paused for two seconds, then said, ""Why are you back?""

""Where are you? I'll come pick you up.""

Actually, the moment I saw that scene in the garden, my heart had already shattered into pieces. But now, here he was, acting tender once more.

""I'm at the door,"" I replied softly.

This row house had been a gift from Xander for my eighteenth birthday.

He had told me then, ""Tina, no matter who you end up with, this house is yours.""

""The woman I care for must have a foundation of her own.""

But now he and another woman were living there. They had even had a child together.

By the time Xander came out, I had composed myself.

He wore a scarf, stepping slowly through the snow towards me, his eyes filled with seeming concern.

When he drew near, he pulled me into a tight embrace, his warm breath ghosting my ear. ""Tina, it's been three years. You've lost weight.""

Along with his warmth came a scent, a sweet, cloying peach fragrance that invaded my senses.

His smell had changed. He used to smell a faintly of mint.

Disgusted by his touch, I shoved him away hard. His pupils constricted briefly in surprise, then he laughed.

""Tina, you've grown up, haven't you? Learned about boundaries between men and women? But I'm your future husband. Don't be distant with me, okay?""

He once was a light in my life.

Why?

Because when I was first adopted by the Luciano family, I was painfully shy, bullied often at school. Once after school, I was cornered in an alley and beaten.

Xander suddenly appeared. He pulled up in a Maybach, cornered those thugs against the wall, got out, and pulled me behind him.

I will never forget him holding a gun, speaking to them in a voice colder than ice,

""Tina is my sister, Xander Luciano's sister. From now on, anyone who dares lay a finger on her answers to me. I'll send them to meet their maker.""

Chapter 4

But now, he felt like a stranger.

It was the same face, yet my heart no longer fluttered for him.

Xander reached to touch my cheek, and my eyes caught the ring on his left ring finger.

It had always been bare before.

""I'm tired. Can I go inside and rest first?"" I averted my gaze, staring straight at his face.

A flicker of panic immediately surfaced in Xander's eyes. ""Sure… of course.""

""But we have guests today. One of the capos just had a son, and he had nowhere to host the baby shower, so they're using our place. You don't mind, do you?""

I once saw him almost a god. Every time I was bullied, he showed up just in time.

Every time I felt unwell, he handled it with calm composure.

One winter, we went out to watch a movie and passed an arguing couple. The boy had cheated on the girl, sneaking off to meet someone else.

Back then, he told me, ""Tina, you should keep your eyes wide open when choosing a man. Use me as the standard for your future husband. I would never lie to anyone.""

But now, he was nothing but lies.

Maybe I had really grown steady at last. I didn't even want to call him out. I wanted to see how long he could keep up this act.

""I don't mind.""

At that, Xander smiled. He tried to take my hand, but I pulled away.

A flash of surprise crossed his eyes, then he smiled, as if reassuring himself. ""You've grown distant now. It's okay. I'll stay by your side until you're your old self.""

But deep down, I knew perfectly well, I could never go back to who I once was.

Three years ago, he tricked me into going to a war zone with Doctors Without Borders.

I witnessed too much life and death. I'd watched a child smile at me one second then turned into a cold corpse the next.

That's when I realized, I must learn to cherish time, because you never know what comes first, tomorrow, or tragedy.

So now, I refused to waste my time on someone unworthy.

Xander didn't take me to the master bedroom I used to sleep in. Instead, he led me to a guest room.

He explained, ""That capo, Ben, remember him? He's all about face, telling everyone this is his place. So they're using the master bedroom for now.""

""Once things calm down in a few days, I'll have the maids clean it thoroughly, and then you can move back in, okay?""

""Okay."" I set my bag down.

He watched me for a moment, then added, ""I don't suppose you like crowded scenes much either.

""Rest here. I have things to take care of.""

After Xander left, I pulled a stone from my pocket. It was engraved, \\\[Safe & Sound.\\\]

A little boy had given it to me while I volunteered in the war zone.

His parents had both died, leaving him completely alone.

With small, grimy hands, he held out this stone and said, ""Doctor, this is for you. You can give it to someone you love, and they'll always be safe and sound.""

I took it. I was about to get up to fetch him some bread when a bullet hit his head, and he collapsed right in front of me.

I broke down hysterically then. I tried to save him, but my colleagues pulled me away.

Coming back to the present, I opened the guest room door and look carefully around the house.

Earlier, I was too caught up in excitement to notice properly.

This home now bore the traces of another woman.

Feminine towels and skincare products lined the bathroom.

Fresh flowers, baby bottles, and children's toys covered the coffee table.

Chapter 5

After taking it all in, I walked to the master bedroom.

I used to live here. Back then, Xander had decorated every inch of it exactly to my taste.

My hand had just brushed the doorknob when a woman's voice cut through the silence.

""You are Tina Fairvale?""

I turned to see the woman Xander had called Stephanie standing behind me.

She had a curvaceous figure, a form fitting dress, and striking blue eyes. She looked like someone vibrant and passionate.

""I am.""

During my time as a doctor, many people would ask if I was Tina Fairvale. I always answered firmly, ""I am."" It had probably become a professional habit.

She studied me intently, then suddenly let out a scornful laugh. ""Xander hasn't told you, has he? I am his fiancée. We have a son together.""

My heart ached dully, but I could hide my emotions now.

""I know.""

""You know? Then why come back?"" She glared at me fiercely.

""This isn't your home anymore. You're just an outsider.""

She lunged at me, swinging for my face, but I caught her wrist.

""You haven't been a mother for long. Don't get so worked up. It's not good for your health.""

My words made her eyes widened in shock.

For some reason, I couldn't bring myself to hate her.

Because she wasn't really at fault. She was just afraid of losing the man she loved.

""Don't worry. Even though Xander and I had a promise, he has a son now. I… won't cling to him anymore.""

The second I finished speaking, she shoved me away with unexpected force and then collapsed onto the floor herself.

""I'm sorry, it's my fault. I shouldn't have taken Xander from you.""

""Tina! What are you doing?""

Xander's voice boomed from behind me. Then I felt a hard shove, and a moment later, a stinging slap cracked across my face.

My vision blurred. Xander's figure swam in and out of focus before my eyes.

But his voice cut through the fog, clear and sharp in my ears.

""So what if Stephanie is my fiancée? So what if we have a son?""

""She's gentle and understanding, not like you, who just cries and makes scenes, resorting to such underhanded tricks to bully others. This is exactly why I never wanted you as my Donna. You're utterly unworthy!""

""Tina, you disgust me.""

""I'm giving you three seconds. Apologize to Stephanie. Now.""

As my vision gradually cleared, I saw Xander pull Stephanie protectively in front of me.

His gaze was icy, filled with pure disgust directed for me.

People downstairs stared up at us, whispering.

""Holy shit, Tina's actually back.""

""She's changed so much. Her hair's longer. She's so thin.""

""Her whole aura feels different. Not like the naive Tina from before.""

Once, overseas, a bullet grazed my leg.

There were no antibiotics left, and I faced a severe risk of infection. But I relied on my memory, found healing medicinal herbs, and treated myself.

Back then, I thought, If Xander hears about this, he'll surely think I'm brave.

But now… he wasn't the Xander I used to love.

During every break, I would take Xander's photo from my bag and look at it. My colleagues would tease me,

""Tina, you're always so calm and collected in a crisis. The person you love must be something special, right?""

I did. I admired Xander for his excellence.

I admired his confidence as a mafia family heir. I admired his calm composure in the face of challenges.

I could learn from him. He could guide me forward.

But now…

In this moment, I knew for certain, I no longer loved Xander.

""I didn't push her,"" I said to Xander. ""She fell on her own.""

""You think I'd believe that? I saw it with my own eyes!"" Xander retorted angrily.

""I know you found out about the baby, and you just lost it, didn't you?""

""Tina, you know why I never liked you? Because I despise how underhanded and vile you are!""

Then I laughed.

""Xander, do you have any idea how many children, how many people in those disaster-stricken countries, needed doctors like us to save them?""

""I regret coming back for you.""

""My time is for more important things.""

With that, I turned and walked out.

This time, I didn't shed a single tear for him.

The girl who used to follow him, crying, had finally grown up.

1rap7vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Beneficial_Effort749/comments/1rap7vl/aipowered_kpi_extraction/,AI-Powered KPI Extraction,"    
    Last Tuesday I spent three hours extracting
    KPIs from a single 247-page annual report. Revenue growth on page 73. Operating
    margins buried in footnote 12. Return on equity somewhere in the appendices. By
    the time I finished, my coffee was cold and I still had four more companies to
    analyze.
    
    This is something I've been dealing with for
    years as a financial analyst, and I know I'm not alone. We spend an absurd
    amount of time on what's essentially data entry - copying numbers from PDFs
    into spreadsheets. It's mechanical, repetitive work that doesn't require any of
    the analytical skills we actually have.
    
    So I finally decided to do something about
    it. I built an AI-powered system that extracts financial KPIs from annual
    reports automatically. What used to take me 3 hours now takes 3 minutes. Here's
    what I learned and how it works.
    
    The
    Technical Approach
    
    The system has three main components:
    
    1. PDF
    Parsing: I started with PyPDF2 but quickly hit limitations with complex financial
    tables. Switched to pdfplumber which handles table structures and positioning
    much better. Critical for financial docs where layout carries meaning.
    
    2. Intelligent
    Extraction : This is where GPT-4 comes in. But here's the thing - you can't
    just throw the entire annual report at the API. Most reports exceed the context
    window. I implemented intelligent chunking (splitting by sections, not
    arbitrary character counts) and used a RAG approach to identify which chunks
    likely contain the KPIs I'm looking for.
    
    3. Structured
    Output : The key was getting clean, structured data out. I use OpenAI's
    function calling to define the exact schema I expect - metric name, value, time
    period, units, source page. The model returns JSON that goes straight into my
    data pipeline.
    
    Prompt
    Engineering Matters
    
    My first attempts had maybe 60% accuracy.
    The breakthrough came from being extremely specific in prompts. Instead of
    ""Extract the revenue,"" I prompt: ""Extract the total annual
    revenue for fiscal year 2025, reported in the consolidated income statement.
    Return only the number and unit, formatted as $X.XXB or $X.XXM. If not found,
    return 'Not Found'.""
    
    That specificity brought accuracy to 95%+.
    
    Validation
    Layers
    
    I learned the hard way that you need multiple
    validation checks. The system now:
    - Validates that numbers make sense (Is
    revenue positive? Is debt-to-equity within reasonable bounds?)
    - Compares key relationships (Does revenue
    minus expenses roughly equal net income?)
    - Flags outliers for human review
    - Stores the source page number with every
    extracted value for easy verification
    
    Real-World
    Impact
    
    Before: I could realistically analyze about
    50 companies given time constraints.
    After: I'm now tracking 200+ companies. Same
    time budget.
    
    The time savings are obvious, but here's
    what surprised me: consistency. The system applies the same logic to every
    document. It doesn't get tired on the 10th report. It doesn't miss footnotes.
    It catches edge cases I might have overlooked when fatigued.
    
    Important
    Caveat
    
    This doesn't replace financial analysts. It
    eliminates the mechanical parts so you can focus on actual analysis -
    interpretation, judgment, strategic thinking. The AI extracts data. I still
    decide what it means and what to do with it.
    
    For
    Anyone Looking to Build Something Similar
    
    Start small. Don't try to extract every
    possible metric from every document type. I started with just 10-Ks and basic
    income statement metrics. Proved the concept. Then expanded systematically.
    
    And seriously, invest time in validation
    layers. Your first version will make mistakes. Mine certainly did. Having
    automated checks and human review workflows for edge cases is non-negotiable
    for financial data where accuracy matters.
    
    I've put together a more detailed technical
    breakdown with code examples and implementation principles if anyone's
    interested: [Link to article]
    
     Questions I'm happy to answer:
    - Technical implementation details
    - Specific challenges with PDF parsing
    - Prompt engineering approaches
    - API costs and ROI calculations
    - How to handle different document formats
    
     Expected Q&A (Anticipate Common
    Questions)
    
    Q1:
    What are the API costs? Is this actually cheaper than manual work?
    
    A: API costs are surprisingly low. For a
    typical 250-page annual report, we're talking about $0.15-0.30 per document
    depending on complexity and how much chunking you need. If an analyst at $75/hr
    loaded cost spends 3 hours manually, that's $225 in labor cost. The ROI is
    clear.
    For context, I process about 200 reports per
    quarter. Total API cost: ~$50. Time saved: ~600 hours (at 3 hours per report
    manually). That's roughly $45K in saved labor costs quarterly.
    
    Q2: How do you handle different reporting
    formats? Not all companies structure financials the same way.
    
    A: Great question - this was one of the
    biggest challenges. The solution is in the prompt engineering and validation. I
    don't assume a specific format. Instead, I instruct the model to search for the
    metric regardless of where it appears, and to include context about where it
    found the data.
    
    For example, some companies report EBITDA
    directly, others only report EBIT and you need to add back D&A. My system
    is trained to recognize both patterns and flag when it's calculating rather
    than directly extracting.
    
    Q3:
    What about hallucinations? How do you ensure the AI isn't making up numbers?
    
    A: This is why RAG architecture is critical.
    The system doesn't generate or remember numbers - it extracts them directly
    from source text. Every extracted value includes the source page number and the
    exact text snippet it came from.
    
    Additionally, I have automated validation
    that flags anything suspicious (revenue growing 500% YoY would trigger review,
    for example). And for production use, I maintain a human review workflow for
    edge cases.
    
    Q4:
    Can you share code? Is this open source?
    
    A: I'm working on cleaning up the code for a
    public release. The core components (PDF parsing, prompt templates, validation
    logic) could definitely be open sourced. I'll update if/when I publish the repo.
    
    In the meantime, the technical principles
    are all documented in the article I linked. You can replicate the approach with
    pdfplumber + OpenAI API + some Python orchestration.
    
    Q5:
    Does this work for other document types beyond annual reports?
    
    A: Absolutely. The same principles apply to
    10-Qs, earnings transcripts, credit agreements, offering memoranda - basically
    any financial document with structured information.
    
    The key is customizing your extraction
    prompts for the specific document type and metrics you care about. The core
    architecture stays the same.
    
    Q6:
    What about tables that span multiple pages? That seems like it would break most
    PDF parsers.
    
    A: You're right - this was a pain point.
    pdfplumber handles it reasonably well but not perfectly. My approach is to
    extract tables page-by-page and then use the LLM to understand relationships
    across pages.
    
    For example, if a table header is on page 45
    and continues on page 46, I extract both pages and explicitly instruct the
    model to treat them as a continuous table. Works about 90% of the time; the
    other 10% gets flagged for human review.
    
    Q7:
    Security concerns? We work with confidential documents.
    
    A: Valid concern. A few options:
    
    1. Use Azure OpenAI which has enterprise
    SLAs and doesn't train on your data
    
    2. Self-host an open source LLM (though
    accuracy trade-offs)
    
    3. Implement your parsing/chunking locally,
    only send anonymized snippets to API
    
    4. For extremely sensitive docs, use
    on-premise solutions entirely
    
    For our use case (public filings), standard
    OpenAI API is fine. For confidential client work, we use Azure OpenAI with
    specific data handling agreements.
    
    Q8:
    How long did it take to build this?
    
    A: First working prototype: about 2 weeks of
    part-time work (evenings/weekends). That included learning pdfplumber,
    experimenting with different prompt approaches, and building basic validation.
    
    Production-ready version with all the edge
    case handling, validation layers, and error handling: another 6 weeks part-time.
    
    If I were starting from scratch today with
    the knowledge I have now, probably 3-4 weeks to production-ready.

1rap7gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenageengineering/comments/1rap7gw/help_me_with_my_overall_te_strategy_op1f_tp7_etc/,"Help me with my overall T.E. strategy? (OP-1F, TP-7, etc.)","I'm a low-key hobbyist electronic musician who has worked on and off with synths and drum machines for many years. I am nowhere near as knowledgeable as most of you, but I have a lot of fun. I have two small kids, and music and photography are my hobbies when I can fit them in. For work, I'm a journalist and writer. In order to keep my writerly productivity up, I spend as little time as possible in front of an internet-connected computer. My main workspace is an office with a big desk where I write with an e-ink tablet that has no e-mail or browser. I listen to music with a turntable or DAP hooked up to speakers. I like to keep my music gear around, to use throughout the day, and so I've gravitated toward a DAWless setup, mostly of small gear that doesn't dominate my desk, and that I can easily pack up and take with me to other locations when I'm working remotely, which I often do. This is where T.E. comes in.

I've owned all sorts of (mostly very cheap) equipment in the past, but right now I use only three items: a KO II, a small chord synth called the [HiChord](https://hichord.shop), and a Zoom recorder. There are various bits of gear that I have my eye on—I think I'd love the Lemondrop, for example—but where I'm really unsatisfied is the Zoom recorder. I record my ideas to the Zoom, and I can listen to them there through audio out, but that's not a fun experience. I can move them from the recorder onto my computer or phone, but that's in another room. What I want is a sort of in-between place where I can store my tracks and ideas, returning to them and enjoying them and maybe tweaking them, before eventually putting them into a mix, uploading them to my cloud music library, and playing them for my wife and kids at breakfast.

There are lots of mixer + recorders that I could buy, but I want whatever I get to be very small and portable, and ideally fun for portable playback as well. I'd like to keep physical awkwardness and cable snarl to a minimum. I have a decent budget. I keep coming back to these four options.

**1010 Bluebox:** This is about $600 new (and cheaper used), and it looks like I can record tracks and mix them right in the device in a fun way, and in a small footprint.

**TX-6:** These are about $850 used, and I like the idea of recording through it to USB storage and using it to play back ideas. It seems like the built-in synth features could be a cool addition. That said, I'm still coming to grips with exactly what this device can do—it actually seems super-practical in various different ways, but is also complicated—and I don't love the idea of attaching a USB dongle to the device.

**TP-7**: About $1,200 used, $1,500 new. This device makes intuitive sense to me in a number of ways. I like the idea of recording my tracks to it and then detaching it from my setup and taking it around with me, sitting in an armchair or in a coffee shop and listening, using the tape wheel to modify playback, layering multiple tracks, recording samples out in the world, etc. As a bonus, in my journalism work, I do a lot of interviewing, using a small Sony voice recorder, and my interviews are often with interesting people and I like to keep them forever. So I could happily use this recorder in that context, and I could probably even expense it (!) as a business tool. Weirdly, this would be sort of a work + play crossover purchase.

**OP-1 Field:** About $1,700 used. I'm also asking myself whether what I really want to do is just simplify, sell all this stuff, and get an OP-1 Field. Why am I adding all these little bits of gear, building up a complex setup with a bunch of wires, when this device exists? I can make music, work on songs, store the songs, edit the songs, and export them when I'm done. It's expensive, but not more expensive than HiChord + Lemondrop + KO II + Bluebox or whatever. But what stops me is that I'm not sure if the tape-recorder-like concept will be satisfying for me long term. With my current setup, I sometimes work in a sequencer fashion with the KO II at the center, and sometimes work in a more tape-recorder-like way with the KO II laying down beats and the HiChord as my performance instrument. If I buy a mixer+recorder, I can continue to be flexible as to approach, adding new gizmos over time. Put differently: if I like both ways of working and buy an OP-1F, will I basically be condemning myself to also buying an OP-XY?

Overall, I feel like I'm seeing the trees but not the forest, and I'd really appreciate some wisdom from the group about options or aspects of this that I'm overlooking. Maybe some of you have made similar decisions and have ideas?",2,1771674460.0,teenageengineering,1,1.0,False

Life looks different now. I’m a software engineer, but that drive never really left, it just became quieter, more intentional.

I naturally gravitate toward depth over noise, calm confidence, sharp minds, effortless conversations. I’m not someone who’s out here trying to meet everyone. I’d rather meet one person who just feels right.

If you think you’re someone who values real connection over small talk, I’d love to take you out for coffee.",2,1771673811.0,BangaloreSocial,0,1.0,False
1rap0ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1rap0ij/should_we_just_stop_dining_out/,Should we just stop dining out?,"Let preface this by saying that my husband and I love(d) going out to eat. Anything from the local pub for pizza and beers in front of a game to Michelin star restaurants and everything in between, we went to frequently before our son. We loved exploring cafes and coffee shops too. When our son was born it slowed down but don’t stop. We had him at a restaurant when he was 2 weeks old. We were always complimented by friends, family, and strangers how great it was we brought him out. We never used screen time to entertain him when we were out either. 

Since turning 1 he has slowly devolved into a toddler with expected toddler behaviors. He is now 22 months. What we have found most challenging is his behavior in restaurants over the last few months. He is better at home meals, but restaurants are something else entirely. He:

\-Will not sit in a high chair or booster seat, he must sit in a chair the adults are or on our laps, which turns into him crawling and standing all over us (he sits in high chair at home still and does not complain at home)

\-He will not use his toddler cups, bowls, or utensils we brought from home, he must use the restaurant adult ones which leads to him making huge mess and spilling water everywhere at least once per meal

\-He whines through most of the meal indicating he wants food NOW. Even a snack before and a quickly ordered bread basket does not do the trick anymore 

\-When he decides he is done he does not want to sit anymore no matter how many times we patiently explain to him that we are eating as a family and he needs to wait. We end up taking turns walking him around while the other person frantically eats. 

\-He has at least 1 meltdown per meal we usually just don’t know what it’s about. And usually a couple other meltdowns we know what he wants but he can’t have what he wants  (like sips of our drinks)

\-He sometimes is distracted by a book or toys, but sometimes he seems more pissed we presented them to him

In other words, we turn into the people you are wondering why they even bothered to try to go to a restaurant in the first place. 

We leave exhausted, miserable, sometimes embarrassed, and on edge with our son and each other. It ruins the rest of our night.

We are sticking to more and more casual and quick eats places, but it’s still bad. We find quick breakfasts in cafes better, but we wish he would be tolerable at other meal times.

We have friends with kids who are 6 and 3 who do amazing at restaurants and meals at home … the friends say it’s because they never stopped treating dinners as non screen family time where everyone sits until everyone is done especially at restaurants. We are trying so hard to replicate this, we were so proud of ourselves just a few months ago, but I don’t know if we can sustain. A lot of our friends with toddlers don’t bother to go out to eat anymore. 

Should we resort to screens? Should we give up on restaurants and do take out until he is older? 

Any advice or tricks would be great.",1,1771673771.0,toddlers,1,1.0,False

I'm a 19F who's been feeling a bit disconnected lately and really want to make some new friends who stick around. I live with my family still, study graphic design online, and spend most of my free time drawing, scrolling Pinterest for inspiration, playing cozy games on my Switch, or trying to teach myself guitar (I'm terrible but it's fun).

Personality wise I'm shy at first but warm up quickly if someone is friendly. I laugh at dumb jokes, cry at sad movies, and I love when conversations go from small talk to real stuff. I'm into art, nature photography, animals (I have a cat who's basically my best friend), coffee shops, and daydreaming about traveling even though I haven't been many places yet. I'm LGBT friendly, progressive, and try to be a good listener.

I'm not looking for anything flirty or short term, just normal friendships with people who message consistently and share bits of their lives. Any age is fine as long as you're 18+. If you're someone who likes texting about your day, sending song recommendations, or ranting about random things, please reach out. Tell me your name, where you're from, and one thing you're excited about right now. Hope to talk soon.",2,1771673638.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

Context: I have a group of friends since college and alam niyo yung pag medyo big group may sub-groups? 😆 

Lately, parang nao-off lang ako kasi nagugulat nalang ako magkasama itong ka sub-group ko gumagala somewhere. Na hurt ako slight kasi ni once di man lang ako na invite. Feeling ko reason is nung college I often hesitate maki-join mag mall or coffee kasi naman teh hikaos pamilya ko. Yang SB at sine, pang 1 week ko na na baon. Tho di ko to nai-express na reason before. So baka they’re thinking na di ko bet mag go out???

They’re good friends. May pinagdaanan ako lately and some checks out on me (yung mga napag-kwentohan ko). Rare din ako mag share ng problems kasi. I think one reason din is di ako pala-chat? Pero when in person naman, super chikadora ako and to the rescue din if they need advices (it goes both ways din). 

Previous attempts: 

Now I have work na kahit everyday pa, gow. Pag may invite sa entire group (minsanan lang nangyayari) sumasama na ako and except lang during weekdays kasi graveyard shift ako.

Ayun lang, medyo na hurt and confused lang ako. Idk how to view this. ",3,1771673584.0,adviceph,5,1.0,False

Expectation outside: you have enough time to write and read

MONDAY: it's 6 a.m I get up, take my meds, get ready and drop my kids of at school. By the time I arrive at work it's 8 a.m I am one coffee deep into waking up. I haven't even thought about writing, but about the bills that need to be paid. I work till 4.pm., no room for thoughts. Function, work, be nice, smile. Maybe there is time for a toilet break. I get home, pick my kids up. Fuck I still need to get groceries so off we go again. Kid is having a bad day. There is 5 minutes to check social media. I absorb maybe half of it. My kid is hungry. Evening routine. Before I know it it's 9 p.m and I need to go to bed. Wasn't I supposed to write something, damn.

TUESDAY: Rinse, repeat, my boss calls a meeting. I take notes. I would rather take notes about the scene in my head but oh yeah customers. I sit in the car park ready to pick my kid up and drive them to practice. 10minutes for a few words. I tap into my notes app, before a screech breaks my concentration. ""Hey mom."" So I abandon the fic and I listen because mom is needed. Before I know it, I'm cooking dinner. Rinse repeat.

Maybe today. I stay up until 10 p.m writing a few words, fleshing out that scene.

WEDNESDAY: doctors appointments, my mom is sick. I need to help around the house, while the kids play outside. Over coffee I have time to read 2 pages of the book I bought before my kid needs help with homework and the bath doesn't clean itself. I don't write today. I haven't even thought about it.

Life goes on.

Rinse repeat. Suddenly it's saturday. I sleep in because I' burned out and the kids watch telly with cereal for an hour unsupervised.

""Mom I'm bored."" The trash needs to be taken out. The house is a mess. Somewhere around all this people have a husband. I don't. So I mow the lawn, I fix that window. Another hour went by. The kids go to play. Now I can write. But there is the dishes, the kitchen, food needs to be cooked. The dog needs to be walked. My mom calls. It's 7.pm. I finally get to sit down. I manage to read a chapter and leave a Kudos. I sacrifice sleep for 2h of words for my new story.

Somewhere someone whines: I don't get comments. My stats. Why is there no update? It's 1 week and I manages to write 2k words. That seems like a lot I think, while my kid has a nightmare and crawls into my bed.

If we established that we met at a specific coffee shop three weeks ago, she’ll actually bring it up later without being prompted.

1raomo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/weedfordumbies/comments/1raomo0/germination/,Germination,"Germination methods 

H2o2 

Mix: 1 part 3% H₂O₂ to 2–3 parts water (e.g., 1 oz H₂O₂ + 2–3 oz water) → roughly 1% solution. Or simpler: 1–2 tablespoons 3% H₂O₂ per pint/quart of water.

	•  Soak seeds for 30 minutes to 24 hours (overnight/12–18 hours is common sweet spot; shorter for delicate seeds).

	•  Rinse seeds in plain water afterward (optional but recommended to avoid residue).

	•  Proceed to paper towel method, direct soil, or rockwool: Place in warm, dark spot until taproot shows (often 1–5 days faster than plain water).

→ Great for older seeds or preventing mold in humid setups.

Scratching/Scarification

Sandpaper Rubbing (Most Common & Versatile)

	•  Tools: Medium-grit sandpaper (80–120 grit works well; coarser for very tough seeds like canna).

	•  How-to:

		1.  Place seed on a flat surface or hold between fingers.

		2.  Gently rub the seed along the sandpaper in one direction (avoid back-and-forth to prevent crushing).

		3.  Do this for 5–20 seconds per seed until you see a small worn spot or the coat thins (often a lighter color appears).

		4.  For batches: Sandwich seeds between two sheets of sandpaper and rub the top sheet in circles.

	•  Pros: Fast for small/medium seeds; consistent results.

	•  Tip: Use a nail file/emery board for precision on tiny seeds.

Cold stratification 

Steps (Fridge Method):

1.  Prepare the medium: Use a sterile, moisture-retaining but well-draining material to prevent mold/rot:

	•  Damp (not soaking) paper towels, coffee filters, or paper napkins (easy to check).

	•  Moist vermiculite, perlite, sand, coco coir, or peat moss (great for small seeds; mix seeds in).

	•  Avoid garden soil (disease risk).

2.  Set up seeds:

	•  Moisten the medium until it’s like a wrung-out sponge (drips slightly when squeezed).

	•  Place seeds on/in the medium (space them out; label with date & variety!).

	•  Options:

		•  Fold in moist paper towel → seal in zip-top bag (poke tiny air holes if needed).

		•  Mix seeds into damp sand/vermiculite → put in labeled container or bag.

	•  For tiny seeds: Sprinkle on surface of moist medium in a small pot or tray.

3.  Refrigerate:

	•  Place in the fridge (vegetable crisper drawer ideal) at 33–41°F (1–5°C) — not freezer (too cold kills many seeds).

	•  Duration: 4–12 weeks typical (most need 6–8 weeks; check packet or species—e.g., milkweed 4–6 weeks, some natives 8–12).

	•  Check weekly: Re-moisten if drying; remove any moldy seeds.

4.  After stratification:

	•  Remove from fridge → let warm to room temp for a day if desired.

	•  Plant immediately in seed-starting mix (or proceed to paper towel germination).

	•  Provide warmth (70–75°F/21–24°C) + light → many sprout in 1–4 weeks.

	•  Pair with scarification/soaking/peroxide (from our earlier chats) for extra boost on tough ones.",1,1771672381.0,weedfordumbies,0,1.0,False

I grind my beans fresh in the cheap agaro grinder on setting-3. I decided on this setting upon comparing different grind levels with the Blue Tokai French Press pre-ground coffee that I have. Tried setting-4 for a few turns which was disastrously uneven. Setting-3 was very very close to the pre-ground coffee in evenness.

DESCRIPTION:
This velvety soup celebrates the earthy, comforting flavors of the Italian forest, offering a sophisticated twist on traditional Italian fare. Wild mushrooms and sweet chestnuts are simmered in a rich, aromatic broth, then blended into a smooth and luxurious velouté. Topped with savory crispy prosciutto and fresh herbs, it's an elegant yet hearty dish, perfect for a special occasion or a cozy evening.

PREP TIME: 25 minutes
COOK TIME: 35 minutes
SERVINGS: 6
DIFFICULTY: Medium

INGREDIENTS:
- 4 slices (about 2 oz) prosciutto, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for garnish
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 2 large shallots, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 0.5 oz dried porcini mushrooms, rehydrated in 1 cup hot water, liquid reserved and strained
- 1 lb fresh mixed mushrooms (such as cremini, shiitake, oyster), cleaned and sliced
- 1/2 cup dry white wine (e.g., Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc)
- 8 oz pre-cooked chestnuts, roughly chopped
- 4 cups vegetable or chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, plus more for garnish
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- Fresh flat-leaf parsley or chives, chopped, for garnish

INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  **Crisp the Prosciutto:** Place the prosciutto slices in a large, cold, dry skillet. Turn heat to medium and cook until crispy, about 5-8 minutes, flipping once. Remove from skillet, place on a paper towel-lined plate, and break into small pieces once cooled. Set aside.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics and Mushrooms:** Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter to the same skillet (or a Dutch oven/soup pot) over medium heat. Add chopped shallots and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add the rehydrated porcini mushrooms and the fresh mixed mushrooms. Sauté until the mushrooms have released their liquid and started to brown, about 8-10 minutes.
3.  **Deglaze and Simmer:** Pour in the white wine and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let the wine reduce by half, about 2-3 minutes. Add the chopped chestnuts, reserved porcini soaking liquid (strained), vegetable or chicken broth, fresh thyme, and bay leaf. Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
4.  **Blend the Soup:** Remove the bay leaf from the pot. Carefully transfer the soup in batches to a blender (or use an immersion blender directly in the pot). Blend until completely smooth and creamy. Be cautious when blending hot liquids; only fill the blender halfway and vent the lid by removing the center cap and covering with a kitchen towel.
5.  **Finish and Season:** Return the blended soup to the pot over low heat. Stir in the heavy cream and heat through gently, without boiling. Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle the hot soup into bowls. Garnish each serving with the crispy prosciutto pieces, a sprinkle of fresh parsley or chives, and a few fresh thyme leaves. A drizzle of high-quality olive oil can also be added for extra richness.

TIPS:
- For an extra depth of umami, add a small piece of Parmesan rind to the soup during simmering (remove before blending).
- If you prefer a lighter soup, you can substitute half-and-half or even whole milk for the heavy cream, or omit it entirely for a brothy, earthy soup.
- When rehydrating dried porcini, ensure you strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve or coffee filter to remove any grit.

But what if I told you the secret to feeling put-together wasn't more coffee, but a simple bodysuit?
Turns out, a little bit of hidden support can make all the difference in how you tackle your day.
The library used to feel like a battlefield. Late nights studying for exams always left me feeling so slumped. My shoulders would ache and I'd just feel... heavy. I’d try to focus on my notes, but my body just felt like a distraction.

One night, while scrolling through things I definitely should not have been looking at, I found this bodysuit. It was supposed to help with shaping, and I just thought, why not? I wasn't expecting much. I ordered it from ursupermart.com and it arrived a few days later.

The first time I wore it, I was going to a study group. I put it on under my regular clothes. And honestly, it was like a gentle hug. My posture felt a little straighter, and the fabric felt smooth under my sweater. It was a small thing, but it made a difference in how I carried myself.

Now, I wear it most days when I have a lot to do. It's become a quiet part of my routine, like making sure I have enough pens or my laptop is charged. It helps me feel a little more put-together, even when I'm buried in textbooks. It just makes the long hours feel a bit more manageable.

If you ever feel that slump during long study sessions or just feel a bit out of sorts, maybe something like this could help. I found this one online and it actually worked for me.

Another day. Another deadline.

I felt like I was drowning in my own life. My work was piling up. My brain was buzzing. Even my clothes felt wrong. Nothing fit right. Nothing made me feel put-together. I just felt tired.

Then one night, scrolling before bed, I saw this shapewear bodysuit. I wasn’t even looking for anything like it. I just clicked on it. I found this one online and it actually worked. It’s called the Yagimi Body Shaper for Tummy Control & Smooth Full Body Shape.

I wore it under my work dress the next day. And something shifted. It wasn't magic. But it smoothed everything out. It held me in just right. It made my clothes fit better. For the first time in weeks, I didn’t feel like I was falling apart. I felt calm. Controlled.

Now I wear it a few times a week. Especially on tough days. It’s a small thing. But it makes a big difference. It helps me feel ready for anything.

Most moisturizers make it worse too, so I tried treating it like a fungal issue — no improvement.

I stopped breastfeeding two months ago and hoped hormonal changes might help. No luck so far. Most problem areas are somewhat under control with Protopic and occasional steroids.

Moisturizers I tolerate elsewhere make it worse. I even tried antifungal shampoos and creams in case of fungal overgrowth — nothing.

I’m adding a photo of the “espresso“ that I just made mostly because I like how the picture itself turned out (I’m a sucker for minimalist photography), and I would like to make it known that it was taken after I already took my first sip, so that is why the crema (is that how you call it in English?) is a bit off.

Now to get to the point: I have been using the HiBrew H10B which my boyfriend recently got for me as a way to support my coffee craze, and this is the very first espresso machine that I have ever owned. The machine is in no way professional but it has a cool pressure display feature, and can also be programmed to make a coffee drink at a certain length which is measured in millilitres. However, I started noticing that each time I make coffee, the weight is different even though I use the same ratios and setup. That is why I decided to stop by in this subreddit in hopes of finding some info and advice on how to up my game, so that my coffees are more predictable and consistent each time.

For this espresso shot I used 10g of pre-ground coffee, and I set the machine to a 30ml shot. However, the end result was a coffee drink weighing about 20ml. The pressure display showed that the extraction was at around 9 bars of pressure. The coffee beans used are an El Salvador honey processed beans that were roasted about two-three weeks ago according to the date label on the box. I bought them a few days ago from a local coffee shop, where I asked the barista to grind them for an espresso . The scale I use is a cheap kitchen scale, so I do realise that the weight it shows is far from accurate, though, as I said, I mostly use 10g of ground coffee and the 30ml espresso shot option, yet most of the time the weight varies between 20 and 40ml. 

So my question is do you have any idea what could be the reason behind this difference? Is it me? Is it the coffee? Is it the machine? Or the overall poor combination of all of the above?

As I said already, I don’t expect the best results but would love to learn how to make the most out of what I already have at my disposal until, hopefully, I find the means to upgrade my gear. ",2,1771670869.0,espresso,5,0.75,False

1rao5zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Physical_Brick_300/comments/1rao5zg/how_do_i_tell_my_parents_i_left_islam/,How do I tell my parents I left Islam?,"Hello everyone!

First of all, I don’t really know how to do this and I’m sorry if there are mistakes,English isn’t my first language:)

  
I‘m 16 years old and a girl.

For a bit of backstory, growing up my mom was non practicing christian and my father muslim.I was given the freedom to choose which religion I would follow, so I did go to Islamic school for a while and also celebrated Christmas and Easter.Another thing you need to know is that my father kind of made my childhood a bit hard. He wasn’t exactly the typical abusive father I guess. But he did have a gambling addiction, cheated a lot and also did beat my mother but rarely me. Overall he also was just a very absent father and even though he tries now, I don’t feel any type of connection towards him. There were a lot of financial struggles and lots of police as well.  
My mother did end up leaving my father multiple times and went back to him every single time. I obviously have a problem with that and to be honest right now the relationship between my mom and I is very strained. Anyway, my mother and father ended up having this big reconciliation, where my mother converted to Islam and they married again Islamicly. When I was 12, I decided to look into religion and ended up converting to Islam. Shortly after that I started wearing the hijab and still do right now. My father hasn’t done anything necessarily violet since my mother converted , even though he is a suspect for theft right now and will most likely leave the country soon to not go to jail, since he has almost gone to jail multiple times before. I think from that you can tell that my relationship with my parents isn’t that good. We just aren’t close and to be honest I feel quite uncomfortable around them, especially my father. I can’t wait to move out once I’m done with school. My mother and I had a pretty okay relationship up until now. We keep getting into each others hair, which actually is the reason why I’m in a coffee shop writing this instead of my home. We just had a big fight and honestly I just needed to get out of there.

  
Okay that was the backstory, hope it wasn’t too much.

so about November last year, I started questioning my faith. Especially since around that time I started to really get into Philosophy, Debates and honestly just religion in general. I guess it’s pretty obvious that after deconstruction, I ended up leaving Islam automatically. I’m now Agnostic I believe maybe even Atheist I don’t know. Nobody knows that I’m not Muslim anymor. I am still wearing the Hijab as of right now and plan on taking it off during the Sommer holidays in order to avoid too many people talking. I will still go to the same school then, but basically I will be in a different part of the school?I really don’t know how to explain but basically half my class will leave school to start pursuing their career and I will stay and graduate to get the highest form of education in my country in order for me to go to university. Basically I will spend 11th grade with a lot of new people from different schools, and two of my friends who are both Muslim will most likely leave as well, so I’m just left there with my two other friends who are Christian.

Now recently, I have started to think about how and when I will tell my parents about me leaving Islam. The obvious thing is, that I will have to tell them that I will take off my hijab by the time the summer holidays come around. So that’s a given right? I just really don’t know how to tell them about that + me leaving Islam.I have a couple of options I thought of;

1. I tell my mom privately first that I am no longer Muslim and then have a conversation with both my parents.

  
2. I just straight up have the big conversation with both of them that I am no longer Muslim.

  
3.I tell them that I will take off my hijab, but not that I left the religion as a whole. This would be the most difficult though, since they will still expect me to act like a Muslim. Including me not doing certain things like having friends that are boys or wearing makeup.

  
Now due to the fact that my mother is a very open minded person, meaning she would love me even if I wasn’t Muslim and went to parties and drank alcohol. She also would love me no matter what religion, my mother basically is what people nowadays like to call “Woke”? I mean with the racism,misogyny and political part if you know what I mean. She basically just is for basic human rights for everyone, which is great. I would probably also qualify as “Woke” for many people.Even if our relationship will be very strained in the next months since I mentioned earlier that we are constantly fighting right now, I think she would still accept that. So she isn’t really what I’m concerned about.

What I have come to think of though, is how my father would react. I really sincerely hope, that he either just accepts it quietly or disappears before I have the change to tell him. Like I said, he will most likely leave the country and go to his home country on a whole different continent. He also wouldn’t be able to come back then since he could be arrested when he steps foot into our country again. I actually wasn’t supposed to tell that to anyone but I feel like it’s important for my questions. Now do I think that my father would react violently or try something similar to honor killing? No, I don’t. Am I sure he wouldn’t? No, I’m actually not. Not at all. And that’s my main fear. I hope he wouldn’t and I want to believe he wouldn’t, but I’m not sure. I mean I don’t really want to end up dead just because I trusted him not to do something like that you know? And the fact that my mother and I had multiple arguments with him about things like abortion and misogyny and he didn’t seem to even try to put his misogynistic views aside didn’t really help when I remember it.

  
Now my problem is; I have no one to talk to about this or to go to in case something actually happens. I am not in contact with any of my relatives. I am an only child, well technically not I have half brothers that are in their late 30s but I have no way to contact them and even if, they are not in a position to take me in. I do have school friends, 4 to be exact. Like I mentioned two of them are Muslim and will probably leave my school soon,so I honestly wouldn’t really want to talk to them because I now it won’t go anywhere. The other two are Christian and I could talk to, but I don’t want my only two other friends to see my life like that. I don’t want them to know. Also just overall we are close, but no one of us really talks about their home life, so I have no clue what’s going on in their home and vice versa. I really just have no one to talk to, which to be honest now sounds pretty lonely, but I promise I’m fine. 

I do have one option I am strongly considering right now. That is that I will tell my teacher. I have this amazing teacher and he genuinely cares about his students and he’s also very into philosophy and overall just a very very open person. He has helped out other kids in my class that had problems at home and honestly I actually genuinely trust him. I could technically tell him about it, I mean just in case something does happen. But right now he doesn’t even know of my childhood so I would have to explain what happened for it to make sense why I would think my father would do something like that. Because I know it’s horrible to think that my own father would be violent or maybe even seriously harm me because of my faith ans I do feel guilty for even thinking about that, but I’m just genuinely not sure. So yeah I could tell my teacher and I trust that he would react good and give me advice, but what if I’m jus thinking about it to much and when I end up telling my parents it won’t even be that bad? I would open up this whole thing and he would then see me for what I actually am which is a child with a troubled childhood and I don’t want him to so me like that. I am quiet in school and teachers always say I’m nice and I have very good grades and I just don’t want that way that he sees me to go away. It’s also kind of embarrassing I don’t know.

  
I really don’t know what to do. I would probably just end up crying in front of him when I try to tell him. But it could be practical not only for the religion situation, but honestly because right now I’m not sure if I can keep living with my parents. There is a lot more going on at home than what I wrote here and it’s not all my dad, a lot of it is my mother. But when I jus add the fact that I left the religion on top of all that, I don’t know if it will go well because right now they don’t even have to think about whether I’m still in the religion, they truly believe I am.  

  
Also, we plan on going on this big vacation to my fathers home country during the summer holidays,which makes things even harder because I will meet my family from my fathers side for the first time, who are almost all Muslim. Meaning I can’t just pretend I’m still Muslim but just don’t wear the Hijab.

  
I really hope what I said here is coherent enough and I would really appreciate any kind of advice because I’m honestly very conflicted right now. ",1,1771670718.0,u_Physical_Brick_300,0,1.0,False

Over the last few months, I've been developing an open-source Rule Engine (called ARE). My main problem was that whenever I had complex, dynamic business rules, I had to rewrite the logic separately for my backend, my web frontend, and my mobile app.

So, I decided to build a unified core architecture that compiles and runs consistently across .NET, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Flutter/Dart. It evaluates dynamic JSON rules seamlessly across all these environments.

I am looking for architectural feedback from experienced devs. Have you ever tried to maintain a single source of truth for business rules across completely different ecosystems? What design patterns did you use? Did you use an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) or a different approach?

No the real reason is because AI is universally hated. So AI users and pro-AI people are an acceptable target. 

Let's compare to another group : vegans.
Yeah, sure, vegans get bad slack from a lot of people. 

But there are also a lot of bunch of people, including non-vegans who defend them.  

And nobody feel to bully vegans so freely. 

But because the AI topic is so one-sided, nobody take a minute to consider they are the real awful person in the situation. 

Plus, I'm sorry, but I feel a lot of hypocrisy 
behind it. 

I know being artist is real fucking hard, no money, not much consideration for the hard work by the general public. 

But life being hard is no justification for being an asshole. 

So because you fear to lose your job, you feel justified in insulting people, with their own miserable, who like to play with their new toy, which brings a bit of joy.

Because you fear to lose YOUR job. Seems egotistical. 

Then you veil that behind social and ecological issue.

Yeah, people were trying to be pedagogue when talking about the fact our phone came from child labor in the mines, that our chocolate, coffee and tea comes from slaves, that our burgers destroy the Amazonian forest, that nuclear waste destroys sea life. And anyone who wasn't a nice pedagogue about it act in an annoying holier-than-you way.

1rao31e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1rao31e/the_psychology_of_highfunctioning_depression_that/,The Psychology of High-Functioning Depression That Nobody Talks About,"

So here's the thing. I've spent way too much time researching depression lately (books, podcasts, research papers, the whole deal) and found something wild. There's this whole population of people walking around, crushing it at work, posting aesthetic coffee pics on Instagram, laughing at parties, and secretly drowning inside. Like actually drowning. And nobody has a clue.

They call it high functioning depression or smiling depression. It's not the kind of depression you see in movies where someone can't get out of bed for weeks. These people show up. They perform. They smile on cue. But internally? Complete chaos. The worst part is that because they look fine on the outside, nobody including themselves sometimes realizes how bad it actually got.

This isn't about being sad occasionally. Everyone feels like crap sometimes. This is about maintaining a facade so convincing that even your closest friends think you're thriving while you're barely surviving. And the science behind why this happens is actually fascinating and explains why so many people miss the signs completely.

**The Productivity Trap** sounds counterintuitive but staying insanely busy is a classic avoidance mechanism. When you're constantly grinding, taking on extra projects, filling every second of your schedule, you don't have to sit with your thoughts. Dr. Meg Jay talks about this in her work on emerging adulthood. She describes how young people especially use busyness as an anesthetic. You feel productive so you assume you're okay. But that exhaustion you feel isn't from achievement. It's from running away from yourself 24/7. Your brain is literally using work as a distraction drug. 

**The Body Keeps the Score** by Bessel van der Kolk goes deep into how trauma and depression manifest physically when we ignore them mentally. Insanely good read. This book will make you question everything you think you know about mental health. Van der Kolk is a psychiatrist who spent decades treating trauma and his insights on how the body stores emotional pain are mindblowing. After reading it I understood why I'd been getting random headaches and stomach issues for months. Your body is screaming what your mind won't admit.

**The Emotional Flatline** is another huge sign. You're not exactly sad but you're not happy either. Just existing. Everything feels muted like someone turned down the volume on life. Andrew Solomon describes this perfectly in his depression memoir. He calls it the noonday demon, this sense of being trapped in grey. You go through motions. Laugh when appropriate. Respond to texts. But internally there's just this vast emptiness. Nothing excites you anymore, not even stuff you used to love. That's anhedonia and it's one of the core symptoms clinicians look for but people dismiss it because they think depression means crying constantly. It doesn't always.

The **Huberman Lab podcast** has an incredible episode on depression and the neuroscience behind it. Dr Andrew Huberman explains how dopamine circuits get dysregulated and why activities that used to bring pleasure stop working. He also covers actionable stuff like morning sunlight exposure and specific supplements that support mental health. Not trying to oversimplify clinical depression but understanding the biology helps you realize this isn't a character flaw. Your brain chemistry is off.

**The Sleep Disasters** are real. Either you can't fall asleep because your brain won't shut up at 2am, or you sleep 12 hours and still wake up exhausted. Sometimes both in the same week. Sleep architecture gets completely messed up with depression. Matthew Walker who wrote **Why We Sleep** explains how depression and sleep have this bidirectional relationship. Bad sleep worsens depression. Depression destroys sleep quality. It's a brutal cycle. His book is genuinely the best thing I've read on sleep science and after applying his tips my entire mental state shifted. Walker is a neuroscientist at UC Berkeley and his research on how sleep deprivation impacts emotional regulation is scary accurate. You need quality sleep to process emotions and regulate mood. Without it you're fighting an uphill battle.

**The Shame Spiral** might be the worst part. You look around and see people with real problems and feel guilty for struggling when your life looks fine on paper. Good job, loving family, nice apartment. What right do you have to be depressed? This is trash logic but incredibly common. Depression doesn't discriminate based on circumstances. It's not a rational response to external conditions. It's a medical condition. Brain chemistry doesn't care about your salary or Instagram following. Johann Hari talks about this extensively in his work on depression. Society has conditioned us to view mental illness as weakness or self indulgence which makes people hide their symptoms and suffer silently.

Look, if any of this resonates, please talk to someone. A therapist, a friend, your doctor. For busy people who want to understand this stuff deeper without dedicating hours to reading, **BeFreed** is an AI learning app built by experts from Columbia and Google that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can set a goal like understand and manage high-functioning depression and it generates a structured learning plan with content from sources like the books mentioned above plus clinical research. 



The brain is just another organ and sometimes it malfunctions. You wouldn't feel ashamed about getting treatment for a broken leg. Depression isn't fundamentally different except society has created this weird stigma around it. But that stigma is slowly breaking down as more people speak openly about their experiences. The science is clear. Treatment works. Therapy works. Sometimes medication works. And recognizing the problem is the first step toward actually addressing it instead of performing wellness while falling apart inside.

I’ve had the Sanremo YOU for about 18 months now and wanted to share my honest thoughts. Moving from a very traditional, all-steel machine with zero electronics (spent a decade with a Rocket Appartamento) to something this modern and with a non-traditional design was a massive leap for me.

# The Buying Rabbit Hole

I went back and forth for a long time and looked at all the usual suspects:

* **Decent:** I’m a tech enthusiast, but slapping a tablet on a metal cube felt like it lacked the ""heart"" and heritage of an espresso machine (sorry fans 😅).
* **Rocket R Nine One:** I love Rocket, but the digital screen wasn't well integrated and felt stuck in the 90s.
* **La Marzocco (Micra/Mini):** Amazing build quality, but I felt like I was paying a massive premium for a machine I couldn't really tinker with. I wanted to experiment with pressure profiles, temp, and flow for the next ten years.

I finally saw the Sanremo YOU in person and it clicked. It’s the perfect middle ground between traditional Italian vibes and high-tech nerdiness, featuring both a beautifully integrated screen and a tactile manual paddle. At first, the bold design wasn’t my cup of tea, but it slowly grew on me and now I’m all-in.

[It's crazy the range of design options we have access to for machines that essentially do the same thing.](https://preview.redd.it/0xjrszk2ttkg1.png?width=2103&format=png&auto=webp&s=6751b972cffb7d11222c8054e874fe94014a620f)

# The Upgrade Impact & Workflow

The biggest immediate difference? **Consistency.** With my old Appartamento, I was always fighting temp stability with long flushes, keeping forgiving dark roasts in rotation. With the YOU’s heated group head and rock-solid temp control out of the box, my ""bad"" shots are practically gone and never had to throw one away while dialing-in.

This gave me the confidence to finally dive into expensive, light, fruity roasts. I can do gentle pulls and long pre-infusions to really unlock those flavors.

It’s also amazing for a two-person household. I can spend my time manually tinkering with a light roast, save that exact recipe, and my partner can walk up later, press one button, and get the exact same shot. 

The ultimate validation: during a recent trip to Berlin hitting up all the hip specialty cafes, my partner admitted out of the blue that she prefers our home flat whites!

# The TL;DR Breakdown

**The Pros:**

* **Consistency is king:** The heated group head and temp stability completely killed the guesswork and endless flushing.
* **The manual paddle:** Best of both worlds. The tactile feel of a traditional machine with digital precision.
* **Visibility:** Having flow rate, temp, and a shot timer front-and-center on a cohesive UI makes understanding the extraction so much easier.
* **Bean versatility:** Total control over pre-infusion and pressure makes pulling light roasts a breeze.
* **Connectivity:** I never use the WiFi or the app. You don’t need it, and honestly, I consider that a huge plus.

**The Cons:**

* **(Lack of) firmware updates:** New features like flow control and brew-by-weight with a connected scale have been teased for years, but nothing yet. It’s a hardware company at the end of the day, not software.
* **The price:** It was way over my initial budget (but as we all know, nothing is rational when it comes to coffee).
* **Polarizing design:** It took a while to grow on me. If you’re a die-hard classic chrome E61 fan, the bold lines are jarring at first.
* **Phantom shots:** About once a month, the machine starts brewing out of nowhere. It's presumably the touchscreen registering a ""phantom"" input. It can be fixed with a screen replacement and honestly isn't that annoying to me.

Has anyone else made the jump to the YOU? I haven't looked back once, but I'd love to hear your thoughts!

I revisited one of the easy challenges - go to location, read computer screen during aurora, move to next location. Easy.

I'd collected every location apart from broken railroad and area just beyond, but I was in desolation point. I prepared myself. Great clothing, I simply didn't feel the cold anymore, flasks full of coffee, a light back pack, just enough food. I've got a pistol, a rifle, and the lovely flare gun with 14 rounds. Mentally I'm prepared for the long walk. The weather is foggy as I enter coastal highway. I decide to take the road instead of getting lost on the ice. As I walk I round a corner to see the slow lumbering bum of yogi dawdling away from me. Ah! There you are.. my hurdle to overcome. My nemesis.

I opt for a flare gun. I know yogi HATES a flare, right... Right?

BAM ... Fizzzzzz ... A flare lands behind yogi. He's interested.

BAM.... Fizzzz .... My aim is poor. Yogi is too far away to hit, but he's seen me. He rears up and starts to chase me down!

I quickly reload! He's literally bearing down on me! I aim..

CLICK

Nothing.

A roar, a close-up of Yogi's face, a lesson in lacerations. I'm left bleeding. Mauled by a yogi that I didn't have to mess with in the first place. 

I gather my thoughts. I crouch to not gain Yogi's attention again. ""Got to do something to stop the bleeding"". I bandage, my neck will never be the same again. I use my antiseptic. I sigh. It's then I notice the weather has changed. I'm now in a blizzard and I'm getting cold. I turn 180 and head back where I came from, knowing there is a car I'll be safe in. I'm sure to grab the flare gun as I leave. 

I've made it to the car. I'm safe. The wind howls. I jump in my menu and check clothing. Yogi did a number on me. He's ruined one pair of ear muffs. My pea coat has taken a battering as have my snow pants. I elected to fix the pants followed by the pea coat. Snow pants at 100%, I quickly set to repair my pea coat.

1rany96,https://medium.com/@auroarasmith01/746ce9f9cf47,The Night a $7 Bottle of Wine Broke My Spirit,"Financial anxiety isn’t about numbers. It’s about the moment you realize your reality has become a cage.

I asked my husband to pick up two things on his way home: some snacks for our son and a bottle of wine for us. It had been a long, draining week, and I just wanted one small, normal moment of relaxation to feel like a human being again.
​His reply was a text that felt like a physical blow to my stomach:
""We only have enough for the baby’s snacks. No wine this time.""
​I stood in my kitchen, staring at the screen, and I felt a hot wave of shame wash over me. It wasn’t about the wine. It was about the realization that I had lost the right to a $7 luxury. I was a mother, a hard-working adult, and yet, I was being told ""no"" by my own bank account.
​The reality of being ""broke"" isn’t a spreadsheet. It’s a lead arrow that hits you when you least expect it.

​Just a month ago, life got even heavier. My son was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. We spent two weeks in the hospital, living between white walls and that heavy, sterile silence of the ward.
​One morning, exhausted and running on three hours of sleep, I stood in front of the coffee machine in the lobby. I reached into my pocket and realized I didn’t even have the spare change for a cup of hospital coffee.
​I stood there, paralyzed. I wasn’t just tired; I was financially suffocated. When your child is sick, you want to be a pillar of strength. But how can you feel like a pillar when you can’t even afford a simple caffeine kick to keep your eyes open?

Every podcast, every subreddit, everyone I know is talking about how hard it is to make real friends as an adult. And it's not just anecdotal, loneliness rates have literally doubled in the past two decades according to multiple studies. The system isn't built for adult friendship. Our cities are designed for nuclear families and productivity, not community. Dating apps exist but friendship apps feel weird. We work long hours, live far from each other, and somehow lost the skill of just being real with people. But here's the thing, it's fixable. I spent way too much time diving into research from social psychologists, neuroscience studies, and honestly some really good podcasts and books. What I found actually changed how I approach connection.

**Proximity and consistency beat chemistry every time.** This comes from research done at MIT which found that people form friendships based on physical proximity more than shared interests. You don't need a soulmate friend, you need someone you see regularly. The whole ""we just clicked"" narrative is mostly retrospective storytelling. Real friendship forms through repeated, unplanned interactions. That's why you had so many friends in school, you were forced to be around the same people constantly without trying. The trick as an adult is recreating that structure. Join something with recurring meetups. A climbing gym with the same evening crowd. A weekly trivia team. A running club. Anything where you show up at the same time and see familiar faces. The friendship happens in the margins, not the main event. Simon Sinek talks about this in his talks on leadership and connection, how the military builds such strong bonds not through intense conversations but through shared routine and presence. Same principle applies here.

**Vulnerability is the actual shortcut but most people do it wrong.** Brené Brown has spent decades researching this and her book ""Daring Greatly"" breaks down how vulnerability creates connection, but here's the catch, it has to be mutual and gradual. Trauma dumping on someone you barely know is not vulnerability, it's using them as a therapist. Real vulnerability is admitting you're nervous about a presentation, sharing a genuine opinion that might be unpopular, or saying ""honestly I've been struggling to meet people"" when someone asks how you're doing. It signals you're safe to be real with. The research shows friendships deepen through incremental self disclosure, not one big confession. Start small. Share something slightly personal and see if they match it. That's the dance.

**You have to initiate way more than feels normal.** This is the part that feels unfair but it's true. Social psychologists call it the ""liking gap,"" we systematically underestimate how much people like us after conversations. That person you talked to at the gym probably liked you more than you think and is also sitting at home assuming you weren't interested in hanging out. So you have to be the one who texts. Suggest grabbing coffee. Invite them to something. Do it again even if they flake once. Research shows it takes roughly 50 hours of interaction to move from acquaintance to casual friend, and 200 hours to become close friends. You cannot wait for friendships to happen organically anymore, you have to manufacture the opportunities. Use the app Ash if you need actual guidance on this, it's technically a relationship and mental health coach app but it has solid frameworks for building any kind of connection. It'll help you navigate the awkwardness of ""hey want to hang out sometime"" without spiraling.

**The depth comes from doing things together, not just talking.** Anthropologist Robin Dunbar's research shows that friendships formed through shared activities are more resilient than those formed purely through conversation. This goes against what we think friendship should look like, deep late night talks, emotional support, inside jokes. But those things come after. You build the foundation by doing stuff. Hiking, cooking, gaming, working on a project, volunteering, literally anything with a shared goal. It removes the pressure of constant conversation and creates natural bonding moments. Plus you're building a history together which is what friendship actually is. The book ""The Art of Gathering"" by Priya Parker is insanely good for this, it's technically about hosting events but it completely reframed how I think about creating meaningful experiences with people. It shows you how to design moments that actually matter instead of just ""hanging out"" with no structure.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into the psychology behind all this without committing to full books, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI learning app that pulls from books like ""Daring Greatly,"" social psychology research, and expert insights on connection to create personalized audio lessons and adaptive learning plans. You can set a specific goal like ""become better at making friends as an introvert"" and it builds a structured plan tailored to your situation. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Plus the voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, conversational tone that makes the content way more engaging during commutes or at the gym.

**You need to accept that adult friendships look different and that's fine.** The podcast ""We Can Do Hard Things"" with Glennon Doyle has an episode on this that honestly made me feel so much better. She talks about how we're comparing adult friendships to teenage and college friendships which were available 24/7, emotionally intense, and frankly kind of codependent. Adult friendships are slower, less frequent, but often more intentional. Seeing a friend once a month and texting sporadically doesn't mean the friendship is shallow, it means you both have lives. Let go of the idea that you need a ""best friend"" who knows everything about you. You can have different friends for different needs. The climbing friend. The deep conversation friend. The just funny and light friend. That's actually healthier than putting all your emotional eggs in one basket.

The loneliness epidemic is real and it's not your fault that making friends feels impossible now. The infrastructure for organic connection has eroded. But small consistent actions, showing up regularly, being slightly vulnerable, initiating more than feels comfortable, doing activities together, these things work. It just takes longer than it used to and requires more intention. But it's worth it because the alternative is way worse.",1,1771669910.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False
1rany38,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1rany38/am_i_doing_something_wrong/,Am I doing something wrong?,Haven't been drinking coffee much lately. Been on a matcha kick for awhile. Every time I make espresso in my moka pot it tastes burnt. I'm used to making coffee with a normal espresso machine. I'm not seeing much of the crema when I use the moka pot. Does using a moka pot affect the flavor at all? Should I be using a more coarse or fine espresso blend? Idk maybe it's just my taste buds are off 🤔,0,1771669904.0,mokapot,7,0.5,False
