1h75t2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonAgeVeilguard/comments/1h75t2l/just_finished_the_game/,Just finished the Game ,"I am going to be honest, I came into this game with the mindset that it was going to be really horrible the way people spoke about it. I played the previous Dragon Age Games and Mass Effect Games so i had a baseline on what i wanted to see.

However after playing it, I have to say as a standalone game its great game, I had fun through out the entire campaign and enjoyed all the characters. The style of the game was beautifully done and the game plane was simple but fun specially as a Grey Warden Warrior just turning everything into fire mush.

On the other hand one thing that i felt was lacking was the execution of certain elements of the story, i felt like everything was really played safe and no real risk were taken which made some things a bit to Cliche and cartoonish but it did not impact to much of the enjoyment of the game.

I loved all the companions, they all added  their unique flavor to the story. I loved Lucanis as he reminded me a lot of my Hispanic family members and their love for coffee at every hour of the day and also trying to force feed you food every minute haha. I also ended up loving TAASH a lot, the way people made it sound was like Taash was going to be the worst character in history but they were good in my opinion. The only thing i would add i felt like their story could have been written a little bit better for the setting, a character struggling with their identity is a great plot but it also felt at times like we left the world of thedas and were back on earth in a random family table. I think they had way more potential to deliver if maybe they went a little deeper with that type of story. Overall Taash was good. On the other hand DAVRIN was GOATED, consider him my rook's best friend. I would say Davrin has the best story out of all companions, i enjoyed it every step of the way and it felt so complete and rich. What can I say about HARDING that the picture below wont say, loved her story and was glad to see her again from inquisition.  Bellara was fun, typical family trouble story but enjoyed her character specially when she was with Neve. EMMRICH and MANFRED THE GREATEST, THE GOAT, THE ONE ABOVE ALL, sorry... i never would have expected to love a skeleton like i did manfred, the only time in the story were i might have cried was during a manfred segment. In turn the entire story with Emmirich and his personal struggle with life and his journey with manfred, it was so enjoyable, i would rank them second in my companion story enjoyment.  NEVE was good, I enjoyed the whole fantasy noir vibe with her, her story was solid thorough out.

Overall, I think the game is solid, is it the best dragon age in my opinion, no but is it this horrible game people claim, i would also say no. Its fun and enjoyable, it suffers from playing it to safe and having me feel like every previous choice we made feel pointless which is fine if they just want a soft reboot.  I had a great fun time with the game even though I miss the more in debt consequences and effect of my choices but overall a solid game with great ideas.

Today's weather is looking a bit cloudy with overcast skies expected throughout the day. The temperature will be around 25¬∞C, so it's still nice and warm out there. Don't let the clouds get you down, though! Embrace the cozy, moody atmosphere and think of it as an excuse to enjoy a day indoors or for a nice beach walk with a loved one under the soft light.

As you start your day, the skies may look a bit gloomy, but that shouldn't dampen your spirits. It's a perfect opportunity to grab a warm cup of coffee from a local cafe and enjoy the peaceful sound of raindrops on the windows. For those with outdoor plans, just remember to pack an umbrella or a light jacket to stay dry and comfortable.

In the afternoon, the clouds might start to break up a bit, allowing some sunlight to peek through. Take advantage of these moments to step outside and breathe in the fresh, post-rain air. The temperature will remain pleasant, so it's a great time to take a leisurely stroll along the beach or explore the charming streets of Puerto Morelos.

Pregnancy is a transformative time filled with excitement, but it can also come with its share of challenges. One of the lesser-discussed but surprisingly common symptoms is restless legs syndrome (RLS) and tingling sensations. If you‚Äôre lying in bed at night with an overwhelming urge to move your legs or dealing with persistent tingling, you‚Äôre not alone. Let‚Äôs explore why this happens, how to find relief, and when it‚Äôs time to seek medical advice.

**What Is Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Why Does It Happen During Pregnancy?**

**Restless legs syndrome (RLS)**¬†is a neurological condition characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations like tingling, crawling, or burning. These symptoms tend to worsen in the evening or at night, interfering with sleep and rest.

**Several factors make RLS more common during pregnancy:**

# 1.¬†Hormonal Changes

Pregnancy hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, can impact the nervous system, heightening sensitivity and contributing to RLS symptoms.

# 2.¬†Iron Deficiency or Anemia

Your body‚Äôs increased demand for iron during pregnancy can lead to iron deficiency, which is closely linked to RLS. Low levels of ferritin, a protein that stores iron, are often found in individuals with RLS.

# 3.¬†Nutritional Deficiencies

A lack of essential nutrients like magnesium, folate, or vitamin B12 can exacerbate tingling and restlessness.

# 4.¬†Circulation Changes

The growing uterus can put pressure on blood vessels, reducing circulation to the legs and causing sensations like tingling or numbness.

# 5.¬†Stress and Fatigue

The physical and emotional demands of pregnancy can contribute to stress and sleep disruptions, which in turn can worsen RLS symptoms.

**When Does It Typically Occur?**

https://preview.redd.it/o87fbtb5605e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6283e58de01437c0806401410e6e073e595405ac

RLS and tingling sensations can appear at any point during pregnancy but are most common in the¬†**second and third trimesters**. Symptoms often peak at night, disrupting your ability to get a good night‚Äôs sleep. The good news? Most women find that RLS resolves within a few days to weeks after delivery.

**How to Prevent Restless and Tingling Legs During Pregnancy**

While you can‚Äôt always avoid RLS entirely, certain lifestyle changes and strategies can reduce its frequency and intensity:

# 1.¬†Prioritize a Nutrient-Rich Diet

* **Iron:**¬†Incorporate iron-rich foods like spinach, lentils, lean meats, and fortified cereals. Pair these with vitamin C (found in citrus fruits) to enhance absorption.
* **Magnesium and Folate:**¬†Add nuts, seeds, leafy greens, and whole grains to your meals.
* **Hydration:**¬†Stay well-hydrated to support circulation and overall health.

# 2.¬†Get Regular Exercise

Gentle physical activity, like walking, swimming, or prenatal yoga, can improve blood flow and alleviate tension in the legs. Avoid vigorous exercise close to bedtime, as it might disrupt sleep.

# 3.¬†Create a Relaxing Sleep Environment

* Stick to a consistent bedtime routine to signal to your body that it‚Äôs time to wind down.
* Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.
* Consider using a pregnancy pillow to support better sleep posture.

# 4.¬†Limit Caffeine

Caffeine can worsen RLS symptoms, so try to avoid coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages, particularly in the afternoon and evening.

**How to Cope with Restless and Tingling Legs**

https://preview.redd.it/lp2xs9w2605e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8c7df6384d6734bc2270e7a347f3557af66c54c

If RLS symptoms strike, these techniques can provide immediate relief:

# 1.¬†Stretching and Massaging

* Stretch your calves, hamstrings, and feet before bed to release muscle tension.
* Massage your legs with a soothing lotion or warm oil to relax the muscles.

# 2.¬†Apply Hot or Cold Compresses

Experiment with heat or cold therapy to see what works best for you. Some people find relief from a warm compress, while others prefer a cold pack.

# 3.¬†Elevate Your Legs

Propping your legs up on pillows while resting can improve circulation and reduce discomfort.

# 4.¬†Practice Relaxation Techniques

Deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, or meditation can help calm your nervous system and reduce the severity of RLS symptoms.

# 5.¬†Engage in Distraction Activities

When symptoms make it hard to relax, try listening to a podcast, reading a book, or engaging in another quiet activity to take your mind off the discomfort.

**When to Seek Medical Advice**

https://preview.redd.it/n72fcp2u505e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=94a12f83138094fc51682b5198900e8eb196ea60

While RLS is usually harmless, there are times when it could signal an underlying issue. Contact your healthcare provider if:

* Your symptoms are severe and consistently disrupt your sleep or daily activities.
* You experience persistent tingling or numbness that doesn‚Äôt improve with rest.
* There is significant swelling, redness, or warmth in your legs, as these could be signs of a blood clot.
* You feel fatigued or irritable during the day due to lack of sleep.

Your doctor may perform blood tests to check for deficiencies (like iron or folate) and recommend safe treatments.

**Treatment Options for Restless Legs Syndrome During Pregnancy**

If lifestyle changes and home remedies don‚Äôt provide relief, your healthcare provider might suggest:

# 1.¬†Supplements

* **Iron Supplements:**¬†If a deficiency is detected, an iron supplement may help alleviate symptoms.
* **Magnesium or Folate:**¬†These can address nutritional deficiencies contributing to RLS.

# 2.¬†Safe Medications

In severe cases, your doctor may consider medication. Always consult your healthcare provider before starting any new treatments during pregnancy.

**Coping Mentally and Emotionally with RLS**

Dealing with RLS can be frustrating, especially when it disrupts your sleep and leaves you feeling exhausted. Here are some tips for maintaining a positive outlook:

* **Connect with Others:**¬†Join a pregnancy support group or online forum to share your experiences and gather advice from others who understand.
* **Focus on the Temporary Nature:**¬†Remind yourself that RLS symptoms often disappear shortly after delivery.
* **Practice Patience:**¬†Be kind to yourself and recognize that managing pregnancy discomforts is part of the journey.

**Final Thoughts: Relief is Possible**

Restless and tingling legs during pregnancy can feel overwhelming, but they‚Äôre a common and usually temporary part of the journey. With the right strategies‚Äîlike stretching, staying active, and prioritizing good nutrition‚Äîyou can manage your symptoms and find relief. Remember, you‚Äôre not alone, and your healthcare provider is there to support you.

Hang in there! You‚Äôre doing incredible work growing a little human, and soon enough, those restless legs will be busy pacing the nursery as you care for your baby. Until then, take care of yourself and don‚Äôt hesitate to seek help when you need it.

I woke up around noon the next day, Saturday. Still fully dressed and lying in my bed on top of my sheets. I had more or less passed out right there.
I rubbed my eyes and tried to recall the night before. 
We had all sat there in front of the stream and watched as basically nothing happened. We had discussed the figure we‚Äôd seen in the mirror and concluded that we couldn‚Äôt rule out natural causes.
We had no idea what the inside of the house looked like in any other room than the two with cameras, so there was no way for us to know what could be reflected in the mirror, it could have been anything really.
And the thing with Ben was just a weird coincident, we all agreed.


I had let the recording continue over night, just in case anything would happen, so I got up and still half asleep threw myself down in my computer chair and with the help of the desk pulled myself closer to the keyboard. I glanced over at the stream, which was still going. This time the woman we had seen last night in the kitchen, the presumed owner, was sitting at the dining room table located in the living room, drinking a cup of tea, or coffee, I couldn‚Äôt tell which.
I drew my attention to the other monitor instead, which had the recording for last night now ready to play.
I started it up and slowly drew the timeline-point from start to end to see if anything stood out during the night, I couldn‚Äôt very well watch it in real time, I would have been sitting there all day long.


Nothing of interest seemed to have happened after we all had given up and gone to bed. The only thing I reacted to was some weird lines on my monitor. At first, I thought it was the lighting of the house we were watching, but if that was the case, it should have changed with the sun rising, flooding her house with sunlight. But it didn‚Äôt, the lines stayed the same, very, very faint, light, curvy, wavy lines in no particular order going across my monitor in all directions.
Maybe it‚Äôs the screen, I thought, not wanting to take that thought to the next step, knowing what these monitors costs. 


My parents had taken my sister to a friend of my mothers, who also had a daughter my sisters age, that lived about 4 hours away. They would spend the night there all three of them, so I had the house to myself.
I went down to the kitchen to grab some breakfast and saw a note from my dad on the counter, basic instructions with some tasks to do, to not forget to lock up at night, close the windows and so on. There was some money for pizza as well.
I really looked forward to a night by myself, without anyone hassling me with chores or my pain-in-the-ass sister driving me up the wall.
‚ÄúJust a chill night with pizza and the guys,‚Äù I thought.


I did have some stuff to do though, and besides, the other ones would rarely be online until at least 6 pm anyways, so I could just as well complete the tasks my parents had left me now and be done with it.
It wasn‚Äôt much, I was to rake the backyard and toss the fallen leaves in a garbage bag, take out the wet laundry from the washer in the basement and throw it in the dryer, and make sure the dishwasher was emptied.


I grabbed some breakfast and then got started.
The dishwasher was closest at hand, so I got to it. Afterwards I got my jacket and shoes and went outside to clean up the backyard. Autumn had come with vengeance last night it seemed, the wind had ripped the leaves from the trees growing in and around our backyard. The sky was dark, filled with fast moving clouds that promised more rain any second. I shuttered and pulled my jacket closer and started to rake. 
We didn‚Äôt have a particularly big backyard, so it wouldn‚Äôt take that much time to get done. I walked around in my own thoughts when I out of the corner of my eye thought I saw something up above me.
I glanced up and swear I could just make out the shape of a person withdrawing behind the curtain of a window on the second floor of our house. Actually, it was behind the curtain of my window, my bedroom window.
A shill went down my spine, and I threw the rake aside and ran into the house, kicking my shoes off as I was running. Up the stairs two steps at a time and flung the door open to my room. Nothing. There was no one. ‚ÄúMy mind is messing with me‚Äù, I thought, while eyeing every inch of my bedroom, breathing heavily after my short, but intense run. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm home alone, all the doors are locked, there‚Äôs no one here but me‚Äù, I told myself. Still, I couldn‚Äôt completely let go of the eery feeling that someone was watching me.


I calmed myself down and proceeded to go back downstairs and finish the yard work. The wind was picking up again, ‚Äúbet there‚Äôll be just as many leaves here tomorrow again‚Äù, I thought to myself. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of this...‚Äù The air had that intense cold in it, the one that manages to creep past every thread of clothing you have on, no matter how thick and warm they might look. Chilling me to my core. Just as I was done and stepped inside, the rain started to drip once more. It didn‚Äôt take long to go from dripping to pouring, and it didn‚Äôt look like it would stop any time soon, the sky grew ever darker in the distance.


I ventured down towards the basement and the last of my chores. I pushed open the creaking door in the hallway that led to a steep narrow wooden staircase with only a bulb on a string above me to light the way.
The washer stood up against the far wall and was beeping and flashing a green light, indicating that it was done. 
I opened the lid up and started to pull out the wet, entangled fabrics and toss it into the dryer next to me when I faintly heard the unmistakable sound of the basement door closing again behind me. I turned around and looked up the stairs just in time to see the door slowly close, all the way. 
I just stood there for a while, trying to comprehend what I just saw, before bolting up the stairs, convinced that I would find the door locked and myself trapped down there. But the door swung open as easily as ever. I took a deep breath of relief and thought it must had been a draft. After going down and finishing moving clothes from one machine to another, I went back upstairs and closed the door behind me, making sure it was indeed completely shut. I still had that creeping feeling that I wasn‚Äôt alone. I just couldn‚Äôt shake it.


Outside, the wind had picked up even more, and the rain was coming down hard. I laid down on the couch in the living room and turned the TV on, flipped through a few channels until finally stopping at an old black & white movie. It didn‚Äôt take long for me to fall asleep, lying there with the rain hammering on the windows and the wind whistling outside, making the whole house creak and moan as well.


My mid-day nap was filled with weird dreams about people moving in the shadows, stormy nights, surveillance cameras and video static. I woke up in a cold sweat, my heart racing, and didn‚Äôt feel at all rested. I checked my phone, 6 pm. I had been asleep for about three hours, but it felt like 5 minutes. I felt almost more tired now than before. As I stood up, I heard my stomach groan and I suddenly felt extremely hungry.


I decided it was time to eat and I dialled the local pizza place while I slowly walked upstairs to see if anyone was online yet. After ordering my pizza I sat down in my chair and moved the cursor around to awake my computer from its slumber. The monitors lit up and I checked the chat, didn‚Äôt seem to be anyone there yet. I didn‚Äôt know if I was imagining things, but I thought the weird squiggly lines on my monitor had multiplied, very vaguely, but there certainly were more than before, I thought.
 A sudden hard gust of wind outside made it sound like my whole window was about to implode, and I was reminded of the absolute hideous weather outside. I pulled out a sweatshirt from my closet and put it on. Even though it wasn‚Äôt that cold inside the house, just the mere thought of the wind and rain outside chilled me to the bones.


I yawned and scuffled closer to my keyboard and saw that the livestream seemed to have been frozen, the woman stood dead still in the living room in what looked to be mid-step, one leg in the air and one on the ground like she was about to walk out. I hit the update button and let the window reload, but she was still right there, mid-step. ‚ÄúMust be some issue with the cameras‚Äù, I thought.


‚ÄúDing‚Äù
-	‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up Jake!‚Äù, I suddenly heard from my headphones lying beside my keyboard on my desk, while the little bears head lit up. I looked over to the chat, it was Henry. I grabbed the headphones and put them on.
-	‚ÄúHey man, what‚Äôs up‚Äù, I responded.
-	‚ÄúNot much, what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù He asked.
-	‚ÄúWaiting for the pizza guy‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúGot the place to myself tonight!‚Äù 
-	‚ÄúAh yeah that‚Äôs right, must be nice!‚Äù he said.
-	‚ÄúDamn straight, nothing but chill tonight! Listen, are you still on the livestream from yesterday?‚Äù I asked him.
-	‚ÄúNah man I shut down everything last night, why?‚Äù he responded.
-	‚ÄúSomethings off over here, I don‚Äôt know if it froze or what, but go back to the link and see if it looks alright for you‚Äù, I said.


-	‚ÄúAlright, hang on‚Äù he said while typing away on his keyboard in the distance. ‚ÄúOk‚Äù he continued, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ Yeah, you‚Äôre right, it must have frozen, otherwise she‚Äôs like doing an insane balancing act over there with that move‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs like up on her toes, leaning forward, looks like it froze right when she was walking out‚Äù he said.
-	‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs what I thought too‚Äù I answered.


Another ‚Äúding‚Äù-sound notified us both that someone else had joined the chat.
The little bears head lit up as Jen let out a loud ‚ÄúHeeeey everyone!‚Äù.


-	‚ÄúJesus Jen, my ears‚Äù I laughed.
-	‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù sha said with a giggle. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up you guys, what are you doing?‚Äù


Henry explained that we only just started to talk and that the stream seemingly had frozen and wasn‚Äôt working.


-	‚ÄúMaybe she caught the ghost and killed the stream?‚Äù Jen suggested in a corky voice. ‚ÄúOr maybe the ghost is just messing with you guys ‚Äú, she laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll log back on and see for myself what‚Äôs going in.‚Äù
Two more ‚Äúding‚Äù-sounds echoed in the chat, notifying us that Ali & Warren too were back online. Everyone said their hello¬¥s and we caught them both up to speed.


We were now all of us looking at the stream, agreeing that it must be a glitch somewhere, either in the cameras or with the woman‚Äôs internet connection or something. That is, until Warren pointed something out.


-	‚ÄúUhm‚Ä¶‚Äù he started ‚ÄúGuys, look at the camera in the living room.‚Äù
-	‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù we all said, ‚Äúwhat are we looking for‚Äù Ali added.
-	‚ÄúLook at the window in the back‚Äù Warren continued.


It took a moment, but then everyone fell completely silent.


-	‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶is that tree moving in the wind outside her window?‚Äù Jen asked.
-	‚ÄúYeah...yeah it is‚Äù, Warren answered quietly. 
-	‚ÄúHow can the stream be frozen in the living room but not outside her window?‚Äù Ali asked with a tone like she already knew the answer to that question.
-	‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt.‚Äù I answered slowly.
-	‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt understand‚Äù Jen added, ‚ÄúWhat is happening here?‚Äù


Before anyone could add anything else, there was a slight flicker in all our screens, and the next second the woman landed on the foot that just seconds before had been suspended mid-air for quite some time now, and calmly walked out of the room and out of sight.


-	‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on over there‚Äù Henry said.
I was jolted to my senses by three hard knocks from my front door downstairs.
-	‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúPizza¬¥s here‚Äù


I ran down the stairs trying to make sense of what I just had seen and got to the front door. The poor pizza guy stood outside with his hood up, soaking wet, shivering in the cold. 


-	‚ÄúHere¬¥s your pizza, dude‚Äù, he said.
-	‚ÄúThanks‚Äô man‚Äù, I said and handed him the money, with an extra five bucks on top of the normal tip.


I closed the door behind me and went back upstairs with the warm, but wet pizza carton in my hands. I sat it down on my desk while sliding back into my chair before opening it up and grabbing a slice. The smell quickly filled the room and once again I was reminded of exactly how hungry I was.


-	‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm back‚Äù, I said while putting the headphones back on.
-	‚ÄúHey‚Äù Jen said, ‚ÄúWarren just asked the woman in the comments if she‚Äôs alright‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre waiting for her response.


The woman was still out of frame, and we all sat in silence waiting for the comment section to be updated.
Suddenly I once again was abruptly awoken from my trance by another three hard knocks on my front door.


‚ÄúWho‚Äôs it this time?‚Äù I thought while once again excusing myself from the chat to go down the stairs. I Stopped in front of the door and leaned in to look through the peep hole.
It was the pizza guy again. I opened the door up and looked at him with a confused look.


-	‚ÄúDid you forget something? ‚Äú, I asked.
-	‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶what?‚Äù, he responded, equally confused.
-	‚ÄúYou just delivered a pizza here‚Äù, I said, ‚Äúwas the money not enough?‚Äù.
-	‚ÄúDude, I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about man, I just got here‚Äù he said looking at me up and down like I was crazy.
-	‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I just accepted a pizza from you‚Äù I said while at the same time wondering if I was trying to convince him or myself. ‚ÄúRight?‚Äù.
-	‚ÄúMan, I‚Äôm not in the mood for pranks or stuff like that‚Äù the guy answered. ‚ÄúDo you want the pizza or not? You know you‚Äôre going to have to pay for it either way‚Äù he said in an irritated voice.
-	‚ÄúLet me show you!‚Äù I said firmly and rushed back upstairs to get the pizza from my desk. But when I got to the room, the carton was gone. In its place where the money my dad had left me, the money I had just given to the pizza guy a few moments earlier. Confused I grabbed the money and slowly walked back down to the now even more irritated pizza guy and handed it to him. 
-	‚ÄúHere‚Äù, I said, probably looking even more insane than before. ‚ÄúKeep the change‚Äù
-	‚ÄúYeah, thanks ‚Äòdude‚Äù, he responded while handing over the pizza and turning around, mumbling something under his breath.


I got back up to my bedroom, still utterly confused and sat back down in front of my computer. Was it just a Deja Vue? Was I losing it? I decided not to mention anything to the others, they would just think I was crazy as well, I thought.  But as I was sitting there, contemplating the recent events around the house, Ali started to talk.


-	‚ÄúSo, guys, I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a baby or anything, but I‚Äôve had some weird stuff happen here ever since we started to look at this stream,‚Äù she said carefully. Still, I didn‚Äôt say anything, waiting for the others response first.
-	‚ÄúWhat..what kind of stuff?‚Äù Henry asked with a curious tone in his voice.
-	‚ÄúWell, maybe I‚Äôm just imagining things‚Äù, Ali continued‚Äù, but I‚Äôve seen movement out of the corner of my eye all day. Like before when I was in the kitchen making a sandwich, I glanced out the window and I could swear I saw a face pressed all the way up to the pane, but when I did a double take and looked again, it was gone!‚Äù
-	‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs just your mind playing tricks‚Äù, Warren stated, ‚ÄúOccam's razor and all, you know?‚Äù
-	‚ÄúYeah, I know‚Äù Ali said, ‚Äúbut it just seemed so real‚Äù.
-	‚ÄúActually,‚Äù Jen interrupted, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been having some off shit happening here as well‚Äù, she sounded almost embarrassed. ‚ÄúMy dad‚Äôs cat, who usually never hangs around me, has been sitting in my room since yesterday, staring up at one of the corners and hissing and making all kinds of weird noises, her fur standing straight up. I‚Äôve never seen her like that.‚Äù
I cleared my throat and started to tell them about all the things that had happened to me over the course of the day and ended it with the pizza guy-incident just moments earlier.


-	‚ÄúI think maybe we‚Äôre overthinking this‚Äù Warren said, ever the cool head. ‚ÄúWe watch this stuff all the time and we want something to happen to us, so we interpret mundane things as weird and label them paranormal when it probably easily can be explained by other means. I mean, Jen - Cat‚Äôs look at stuff, and reacts at stuff, it‚Äôs normal. Ali ‚Äì pareidolia is a real thing, we see faces where there are none, Jake ‚Äì Ok yours is a bit weird, but I don‚Äôt know, hallucinations, daydreaming, bad sleeping patterns, all these things could play insane tricks on your mind. I don‚Äôt mean to belittle your experiences, but we must keep a sceptic view on these things, right? Besides, I‚Äôm pretty sure I only heard you excuse yourself to go get the pizza once, not twice.‚Äù


We all agreed, but at the same time, we who had experienced stuff knew what we had seen and felt. But we didn‚Äôt push it any further. There wasn‚Äôt much more activity on the stream for the rest of the night, we didn‚Äôt see the owner, or anything out of the ordinary. We took a break from movie-watching, and everyone was doing their own things, and after a while I felt I needed to go to bed. I said my goodbyes and shut the computer off. After brushing my teeth, I crawled into my bed and pulled the covers close, the wind and rain had in no way diminished during the night, it felt like a continues storm raging outside, it was both soothing and menacing at the same time.


I was seconds away from falling into a deep slumber when something dimly lit the room up. I squinted from under the covers, and realized it was the bears head lighting up behind my chair, on the desk. ‚ÄúWhat the hell, I turned the computer off‚Äù, I thought while getting up to double check that everything indeed was turned off.


The stand-by light on my left monitor was glowing faintly green, indicating that it still had power, and when I moved the mouse, the screen came back to life. Just that one screen though, and what I saw caused me to fall back over the chair and down to the floor. My heart beating so hard I thought it would jump right out of my chest. The faint squiggly lines that had been slowly forming over the course of two days where now much brighter, and not at all random. They spelled out eight words in a sentence; ‚ÄúSoon it‚Äôs your turn to host the stream‚Äù.",1,1733392343.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False
1h75ox8,https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/1h75ox8/bioware_needs_to_keep_in_mind_that_its_ultimately/,Bioware needs to keep in mind that it's ultimately designing protagonists and companions who are killers.,"One thing I've noticed in both Andromeda and Veilguard is a general upward tick in ""bubbly"" atmosphere, sometimes either expressed by its protagonist, or more concretely by its companions.  Andromeda had a far more positive vibe than any of the original trilogy overall, and Liam and Peebee were slightly ""zany"" characters, though I don't think they are egregiously so (Liam sucks for other reasons than being ""zany,"" per se).  From what I've seen from Veilguard, it seems like this tone has only been emphasized.

There's nothing necessarily wrong with this in a vacuum, and it can work very well in the right kind of game, but both the Mass Effect series and the Dragon Age series are games where the primary gameplay mechanic--besides dialogue, of course--is moving around a map with your companions and engaging in deadly combat.  The fact that the Initiative is a civilian organization and not a military one becomes a frivolous distinction when the Initiative gives you military arms and armor and allows you to murder your way across the Heleus Cluster just as if you were Commander Shepard.  And indeed, killing living beings is a large proportion of what you do in that game, just as it is in the original trilogy.  Some mild ludonarrative dissonance occurs, for example, when the party comes aboard the Tempest presumably covered in kett guts and decides to celebrate with a nerdy ""movie night"" where much ado is made about ""having the right snacks.""

I want to stress that I don't think Andromeda had any truly egregious examples.  But the clips I've seen from Veilguard's companions--companions who are supposed to be living in a medieval fantasy beset with violence and death, mind you--talking about coffee and writing fan-fiction concerns me about the trajectory Bioware has been on.  The characters that Bioware writes are inevitably going to contain an aspect of the writer in them, it's only natural--but the first principles for character writing for a fictional setting needs to be ""in what ways would warriors who exist in this milieu actually behave,"" and not ""how can I inject my 21st century, relatively comfy first world life into this action RPG?""  It's having your cake and eating it--writing characters who are wacky instant ""found family"" inductees with cutesy quirks like sniffing soap, but who also set living beings on fire with Incinerate or shoot them in the face with a sniper rifle with no emotional trauma whatsoever.  As a former member of the military, this juxtaposition seems bizarre indeed, if not thoughtless and tone-deaf.

It's possible that my concerns are totally groundless.  Michael Gamble has said that ""Mass Effect will maintain the mature tone of the original Trilogy"" (https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1851091873584308332), implicitly (and intriguingly) doing a small-scale *damnatio memoriae* on Andromeda and its more light-hearted tone.  I just hope, perhaps vainly, that Mass Effect's development team utilizes writers who are organically inclined to engage with said mature tone, and are not just doing so as a reaction to the tepid response to Andromeda and Veilguard.",24,1733392321.0,masseffect,3,0.82,False

1. I followed the steps to do a manual preinfusion by pushing the doubleshot espresso button. I timed my shot and after about 7/8 seconds, the first coffee started flowing. I thought the manual mode meant that I could decide how long the preinfusion would last. However, I tried multiple times and regardless of how long I pushed the button, the water always started to flow at around 7/8 seconds. Is this normal or am I doing something wrong?
2. What is the normal volume for a double espresso? I know you usually calculate by weight, rather than volume but I am a bit confused. My yield with 18g of beans was 36 g of espresso, about 40 ml (approx, taking into account the crema layer) in 25 seconds. However, the Sage manual says that a double shot is supposed to be 60 ml?
3. Would you recommend changing the programme so you don't have to time your shots anymore or just always use manual?
4. I've read that the pressure gauge is just an indication and the timing, taste etc. should be your main guidance. However, as a beginner it does feel like the gauge is helpful even though. Is it normal that my espresso always stays around 11 o clock? Would it be better if it was further up in the espresso range

When I was a child I had some weird behaviour/thoughts. I used to have a thing where if I went to sit on a chair, I had to sit up and down on a it multiple times, like sit/stand,sit/stand,sit/stand so I didnt become like the person who sat on it before me. I could have been at it for a few minutes. There was no set number of times I had to do it just until felt right. 
I used to have walk back the way I came into a room. For example if I walked around the coffee table on the left side I had tobwalk back around that way when going back the ways.
For months I became overly aware of my heartbeat and it made me so anxious.
I used to think that my daddy could read my thoughts but he wasnt telling me and I would get anxious and try to make sure I was thinking nice things when I was around him. 
As an adult, whenever I think of something I dont want to could be something silly that gives me anxiety or a memory of my past Ill try and block it but blurting out random things.  It varies but a lot of the times its things like 'go home' and the other repeated random phrases. I have children and get very anxious when theyre in bed or when I wake up in the morning. I have to check them several times to make sure theyre ok and when they were very young I used to have to get their daddy to check them as I was too scared to look in case they werent breathing.

1h75no6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1h75no6/the_tragedy_of_my_jittery_dear_old_windbag_aunt/,"The Tragedy of my jittery Dear old Windbag Aunt Sally
(Poor one out For Dead homies)","

It not fuckin funny how you can grow up thinking something is just part of life, only to realize later that it been the thing undoing you all along. Life is trash like that, and that's why I drink vodka now. 

Aunt Sally was always the life of the party, despite worshipping political figures (mostly old men) and probably jerking off to them. 

She had a warmth about her, the kind of person who‚Äôd tell a story you didn‚Äôt know you needed to hear (like the time she fed her dog the last peanut butter sandwich and then shot it in the face with shotgun because Rufus ""clearly had cancer""), but looking back now, caffeine was definitely the villain of her life, killing her without ever letting her chill - blap blap, motha fucka. 

Sally‚Äôs relationship with caffeine wasn‚Äôt anything extreme by today‚Äôs shitz. She wasn‚Äôt one of those people who posted memes about ‚Äúneeding‚Äù coffee to survive or guzzled energy drinks like water. It was more chill than that - she even smoked the occasional medicinal marijuana joint, but it was always 90% coffee and 10% weed or alcohol in her life. 

Now, I always swear to to the opposite.  She died way too young, at 69. I don't try a lot of grass, but I've been drinking plenty of white wine and vodka since she passed.  I think this is the way. I'll never touch another cup of coffee again, unless it's just to take a little sip - because it is just poison and science and doctors everywhere are starting to confirm this. 

Mixing weed and alcohol makes me crazy and evil, but maybe that's just a me brain thing. I don't do that now. Last time I did I got divorced and my child a wife left, but I found baby Jesus now so maybe they'll come back soon. 

Coffee kept poor old fuckin aunt Sally going when her body was pleading for rest. I'm way younger and figured out coffee was bad. 

One morning, she didn‚Äôt wake up. The doctor called it heart failure, and just shrugged when I got in his face (and that's when I realized I was out of line and acting like Aunt Sally on the evil caffeine monster). 

After Sally was gone, I found myself questioning everything I‚Äôd taken for granted about coffee. It‚Äôs such a normalized thing. It‚Äôs everywhere, and we treat it like water (necessary, harmless, even virtuous).

What if the thing we should be wary of isn‚Äôt alcohol, but coffee?

After Aunt Sally‚Äôs funeral, I stopped drinking coffee. I freaked out on her corpse because they did open casket, and my family made me leave after I yelled at her dead face for letting my daughter try coffee at only 12 years old. Now my estranged daughter is always drinking energy drinks behind my back, and just living with my dumb wife and spreading untrue rumors about me on social media (which I would never allow her on, if I had any say). 

Society has long painted alcohol as the villain, the thing to avoid unless you‚Äôre celebrating or winding down after a hard day. But as I adjusted to life without caffeine, I started to wonder if we‚Äôve been too quick to judge. I did research, and all the 100 year olds drank alcohol everyday - NOT FUCKIN COFFEE, RETARS!!

My ex-wife will come back when she sees how fun I am now. I even threatened someone at work and did a new resume (not drunk but tipsy and lied on it) and now, new job haha fuckers I get paid. 

A good glass of red isn‚Äôt just a treat - it‚Äôs a mother fuckin source of antioxidants, something that actually supports your heart. Fuck beer - unless it's there and free. 

I pound vodka shots like a champ now.  I'ma live forever basically, as long as I only do eight or ten shots a day - somewhat spaced out. It's just science and you can't argue with fucking science unless you're looking back.  We're looking forward now, and caffeine bad. That's new science and research we figured out. Look it up, if u don't know already. 

I‚Äôm not saying alcohol is perfect, it be abused, just like anything else. But fuckin coffee pushes us to go faster, to do more, to ignore the natural rhythms of our bodies until we die as fuckin slaves to these meaningless, polluting, earth and mind and body raping corporations. 

You can fuck on it, which basically proves it healthy. Every tried fucking on coffee? It's just not a natural feeling if you sit back and take a moment to think about it, with your genitals connected to your loved one's genitals and the coffee mug right there and the shit in your blood screaming at you - you can't fuck like that and stay healthy for too long, and every doctor and scientist will confirm that if you aren't too pussy to ask. 

It‚Äôs not just personal observation, either. Studies have shown that moderate alcohol can have real health benefits, from improving heart health to reducing stress. And yet, we stigmatize it to the status of badness or gta vice city type shit. Meanwhile, coffee is a fuckin MURDEERER!!!

That's why I work at Target or wherever I happen to work at the time, always with some vodka in the car that I can sip on during breaks or whenever I can sneak out. NO ONE XAN STOP ME!!

I‚Äôve thought about Aunt Sally a lot as I‚Äôve made this shift. I still miss her every day, but I see her as dumb now. Pour one out for dead homies. 

These days, I raise a glass to Sally every now and then‚Äînot a cup of coffee, but a quiet toast with a glass of wine or a simple gin and tonic. It‚Äôs my way of honoring her memory while trying to live differently. To find balance, to listen to my body, to let go of the things that push me too hard and embrace the ones that let me breathe.

Maybe we‚Äôve had it backwards all along. Maybe it‚Äôs not alcohol that needs to be demonized, but coffee. Maybe the real indulgence, the real escape, is letting yourself slow down, even if it means putting down the mug and picking up the glass.

Here‚Äôs to Aunt Sally, and to doing things differently. Doing shot now. And again.

Another thing about alcohol, is that it actually promotes being active, which is necessary. It's not heart healthy to work out on caffeine - it will kill you fast. Caffeine promotes rest, but also doesn't allow you to rest; it's fucking evil as fuck. 

I'll sip some coffee once in a while, but that's not a healthy habit every morning. You'll be bedridden at a certain point, without knowing why.

1h75n1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaffeBox/comments/1h75n1p/day_5_amateur_review/,Day 5. Amateur review,"Today, I've decided to follow yesterday's experiment and do the blind testing before checking what was that I brewed. In general, today's pick was a surprise experience. It's not necessarily positive or negative. Half-way through the review I thought that it will be short and boring one. Just like my experience in the beginning. But I was surprised. And you will see what I mean later in this review.

Considering I didn't check the coffee information prior to testing and didn't see the brewing recommendations, I went for [yesterday's pick recipe](https://www.kaffebox.no/2024-04/#text-724790527) for Origami.

https://preview.redd.it/iwyfooyg405e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55a6e6c016df4a6f078ee4598fa0bc679458e7d2

**ROAST:**

It's really hard to tell when looking at the photo, but the roast is a bit darker than yesterday's Maracatura and my blueprint Scandinavian light roast. But the difference is indeed pretty negligible. When looking at the beans alone it's hard to tell the origin or varietal (like it was with Day 4), but some defects with ""open beans"" (not too many, to be honest) instantly reminded me of some African (Kenya?) bags in the past. I tend to remove these when I'm brewing as these beans are roasted more than it needs (visually they also look darker) and might affect the cup making it more bitter than needed.

[Day 5 roast \(left\) vs Day 4 \(top right\) and the blueprint roast](https://preview.redd.it/skoagm0axz4e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9588b806b6dac9ab6c038fe4fc69208a4331b686)

**AROMA:**

Bang! This was a major bummer to me. When opening the canister it, just like with some other picks, it smelled pretty much nothing. Just very subtle ""standard"" coffee smell. I desperately tried to smell at least something unique and failed. And I think, it might have something to do with the environment temperature - we're in the winter time and usually, it's pretty chilly even inside. This doesn't help aromas to develop and to ""escape"" the surfaces like the beans. Nevertheless, we had picks with identity (whether pleasant or not so much) in this calendar (Day 1 and Day 4 for example). Anyway, right off the canister I smelled nothing that I could describe other than just ""coffee"".

When ground, the beans started to reveal some of the internals. Not too intense, again. But, at least, one can start picking different notes apart. To me, the most prominent notes were raspberry and something oddly sweet like licorice. None of which is my favorite. However, they were holding together pretty nicely and I would describe the aroma of grounded coffee as pleasant.

Before I talk about notes in the brew, I have to note one thing. Usually what happens is that the beans release a lot of aromas when bloomed. You get intense untamed aromas of different notes that blend together in your cup later on to create the bouquet of that cup. But that's not the case here - when blooming I still was getting that dull ""regular coffee"" aroma. I was really puzzled and started to lose hope for these beans at this moment. But that was about to change after I was done with the brew.

https://preview.redd.it/zgv5ni6j405e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=adf3b6bb81cfe6f84880df0228b281232a93065e

When brewed, coffee transformed quite significantly. From something very muted and undefined, I've got a cup that started hinting at something interesting. The aroma started to reveal sweetness and fruitiness which were nowhere near before beans contacted water. I was pleasantly surprised. I still couldn't identify any particular notes at this stage, however. And then I got to tasting.

**TASTE:**

Here's where I was amazed by the transformation of these beans. From unidentifiable bunch of beans, I've got a distinct black tea with some sweetness (like very nice sweet clementine). None of which I was expecting here. I don't know where these notes were hiding, but water really made them take the spotlight. And the cup was very enjoyable after all. I don't know whether it's psychology (make it really bad in the beginning so that ""normal"" feels extraordinary after all) or that's really how these beans should be. But the cup was very enjoyable after all. Light bodied, fruity, refreshing. I assume it's a wonderful pick for summer to brew as iced coffee or as cold brew. It won't give you a nice, warm, cosy Christmas feeling. But it definitely brings pleasure and somewhat summer joy when sipped. All that if you overcome bias after very undefined and dull aroma one experiences at every single stage of the process prior to tasting.

**DISCOVERIES:**

https://preview.redd.it/0ionuk4l405e1.jpg?width=2957&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f4644217e9e305466c87e4870a1e1b8ae2541ab

Again, it was a blind tasting without knowing what I was really having in my cup. So, after checking the official pick's page, I was pleased to see that the origin is indeed Kenya (though it feel wrong to identify an origin by coffee defects). However, I was surprised to see the notes listed: juicy, lime, black cherry jam. Juicy - yes. Lime? Well, could be - what I took as raspberry in the aroma, I guess could be lime indeed. But I don't think I've got it in the taste. And ""black cherry jam""? Well, I think I will have to get to the local grocery store to double check. But remember one thing - tasting notes in coffee are veeeeeeery subjective. When you taste something in coffee it doesn't mean it has orange, or jam, or lime in it. It's all on the subjective perception level. So we all can have very different tasting perception of the same coffee. And that's why we all enjoy this drink, I believe - it can be anything you want or feel.

All in all, it was a very interesting pick for me even if just from the explorational point. I've had much more aromatic Kenyas (actually have one in my cupboard right now) with much more character, identity and joy. But in this case, it's somehow very soothing to see how the¬†ugly¬†duckling turns into a swan in-front of your eyes. Technically, nose and tongue in this case, but you get the idea.

1h75lwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorkshire/comments/1h75lwl/three_wonderful_days_on_a_budget_in_yorkshire_a/,Three wonderful days on a budget in Yorkshire: a trip report,"I got such good advice and recommendations when I asked for ideas on this subreddit when planning my trip, so I've come back to share a report, which will hopefully help others or just be of interest. It's quite detailed :)

I booked everything quite a way in advance, so got good prices. 

Started with a train from Sheffield to Scarborough. This ticket cost ¬£15.30. When I realised the train went through Filey, somewhere I've always wanted to go, I decided to get off there. There had been a storm in the days before my visit, so it was quite muddy, but I really liked it. I walked from the train station out to Filey Brigg. I was hoping to see some seals but no luck. Amazing views anyway. Popped into a huge charity shop next to the station and avoided buying anything (more to carry), got some snacks from Heron foods. I liked the postbox topper in town which had a festive scene on it. Then I got the bus (¬£2) to Scarborough. 

All I did in Scarborough was change buses, as it was starting to get dark and there wasn't anything in particular I wanted to see there. The bus took me to Robin Hood's Bay. Almost everything seemed closed - all I wanted was to buy a small bottle of milk but couldn't find one. Continued walking to the hostel at Boggle Hole, as directed by Google Maps. It was getting very dark now and the path was muddy and up and down. Not very safe, and I was glad I hadn't arrived any later. 

The hostel was lovely - certainly one of the nicest I've ever stayed in. One night in a private room cost ¬£22.50 (I am a member so I get a discount.) There was an open fire and a small kitchenette with a kettle and microwave. Had a very comfortable night, and got up early to go down to the beach to see the sunrise. Beautiful setting right on the beach with nobody around. 

Set off for my walk straight after breakfast, and I was truly blessed with the weather. After days of relentless rain and clouds, the sky was completely clear and the sun shone all day. I'd wanted to walk along the beach but the tide made that too difficult, so I took the clifftop path again. I explored Robin Hood's Bay, which was gorgeous, with nobody around. I'd like to come back and enjoy a drink in the sun one day and a look around the book shops and cafes. 

I walked to Whitby, and thoroughly enjoyed the walk. Spectacular views, and as people had said on here, it wasn't especially difficult. Plenty of places to sit and have a snack. I saw barely anyone else until I was nearer to Whitby. The last time I was in Whitby, it had been pouring with rain (in July!) so to be back in November and see it in glorious sunshine was a real treat. I had an hour or so in Whitby, during which I treated myself to a cocktail and looked round the charity shops. There's a wildlife rescue charity shop there that I like, they always have some strange things in which are very cheap. 

From there, I took the coastliner bus to York (¬£2). This is a real bargain - it's a long journey, has high, comfortable seats, and USB outlets to charge your phone. I indulged my inner child and got a seat at the front on the top deck. Great views as the sun came down. I wasn't feeling so enthusiastic when we got to York two and a half hours later! 

I was staying at the YHA in York so followed Google Maps to get there. Once again, it took me down a somewhat creepy pitch black alleyway, but it got me there, and I was happy walking after sitting on a bus for hours. This time I was in a shared dorm, which cost ¬£13.50. It was fine and not full, and the other guests were respectful. Made use of the kitchen for dinner and breakfast. 

The next day was beautiful again. Went to the railway museum first, as the last time I'd been in York it was in 2021 and it had been closed. I like trains so this was fun - I do wish there were a few more trains you could go inside though. After that I spent most of the day wandering around (walked on top of the city walls, did some shopping, had coffee) until my train to Harrogate. I thought I'd tack that on as I'd never been there, but this didn't turn out to be a great idea, as when I got there, it was dark, everything was closed or about to close, and the Christmas market hadn't opened yet. I spent most of my time there in the M&S food hall and sitting at the train station as I was tired of carrying my bag. From there I got my train back home (¬£9.60). 

Overall, an excellent, packed trip. I'll definitely come back and walk more of the coastal paths in that area as that was the highlight. What a beautiful part of the country. We are so lucky to have access to trails like that. \*Will see if I can add a few photos. Thanks once again for all the advice!",9,1733391932.0,yorkshire,2,1.0,False

Even if he just chose random numbers, just memorized all of it and predicted how Kidou would act in the game it still won't make sense on why he knew he needed the no.6 creamer.

the image above says how he just needed to know that the game is going to use coffee creamers but he also needed to know what game it would be right? did just choose a random number and if Kidou chose a different game he just needed to improvise to use the no.6 a different way?

My partner (28 M) and I (32 F) met a few years back. The chemistry was insane and we seemed to truly and deeply understand each other. We got engaged super quickly (I asked even tho marriage wasn't really in my plans) but we were really happy. 
We did run into some trouble (I have auDhd and trouble managing my anger but I tried hard to get a hold of it and I stopped throwing shit to the wall when I was mad because, coming from a violent home in his childhood that would make him really sad and upset). However, I also come from a troubled home and get really triggered when people raise their voice at me instead of speaking calmly (that's what would trigger my anger) and he could not have an argument or discussion without doing so, even tho I asked him repeatedly and explained that my logical brain shits down when that happens). He never managed to stop it but I did stop letting it trigger my anger and manage to not do anything stupid again). 
I got pregnant. We had a kid. The baby almost died during childbirth and I got really bad post partum, I would not let that baby out of my sight for a second, I think, because I watched him almost die when I gave birth. So my SO started to feel like I didn't care about him and that I wouldn't listen to his opinions about the baby (which is true) so he checked out. Started spending all his time playing videogames (even when the baby was asleep and I asked if we could play anything together like we used to he always wanted to be by himself). Our kid had night terrors for a long time and, since I was staying home with him (COVID related issues) I had to tend to them and he started sleeping on another soon so he could rest. We grew further apart and I felt like I was raising our kid alone and working basically 24/7 (kid, house, everything on me alone). We got into an argument and he said he would leave (he'd done that a million times prior and I used to ask him to please stay) and I said: ok, do it then, I'm done.
We separated. He got mean AF during this time and co parenting was a nightmare.
Now, years later, we started hanging out more in order to try to give a real family to our kid (as friends). Eventually we fell in love again and started dating again (no one knows yet). We both changed a lot in these years and he apologised for the gaslighting he used to do when we fought,  he recognised he should have voiced his concerns when we were new parents instead of just checking out (the end was really bad, my depression got so bad because of it all I was severely medicated). I acknowledged my own failures in the relationship. We seemed to be on track to make it work this time around. 
Now, he raises his voice again whenever we disagree, I feel like he gaslights me when we do fight (I can't even tell at this point because I'm unsure if it's all in my head or not but I get so confused by the end of a fight I have no idea what was told during it by the end so I can never give the examples he asks for) and he is now super jealous of my dating life when we were broken up (mind you he got a gf and moved in with her during that time but she was verbally and emotionally abusive and that's how he recognised what he did to me when we were together) because I had an#l s@x with someone during that time and never wanted to try it with him. (Ok so for context I am a SA survivor and that was tried on me and it hurt and left me scared of it and my current SO has a pretty big....so I never wanted to try it) But dealing with my SA trauma I came to want to try things that used to scare me when I was single again...and I told him about it. Now he's mad because I loved him and didn't do it with him but did it with someone I didn't love...
I feel like he didn't change as much. The other day a guy I barely know but have known for years and even know and like his wife gave us a discount on our coffee and I told my SO that the other guy had been a sweetheart (as a reaction to the discount) and he got mad because I should only call him a sweetheart....for me the word doesn't carry that meaning but I still apologized and told him I wouldn't do it again. 
I feel like I'm always saying sorry for a lot (even being forgetful but when I try to explain my audhd traits he just says stuff like ""everyone's ADHD these days"" or ""your ADHD isn't an excuse you're a grown women so manage it"" (I was only diagnosed 2 years ago, prior to that I just felt like I sucked) and I'm not using as an excuse but as an explanation.
I suggest couples therapy. He seems in the fence about it. He will also ask his GP for a psychiatrist because he was diagnosed bipolar a few years back and never delt with any of it and is unsure if the diagnosis is correct).

I'm not even sure why I'm posting this, I guess I just felt so happy when we got back together and I had my family again and now I feel like he hasn't changed that much and it all starts to feel hopeless and I find myself often feeling sad again

1. I followed the steps to do a manual preinfusion by pushing the doubleshot espresso button. I timed my shot and after about 7/8 seconds, the first coffee started flowing. I thought the manual mode meant that I could decide how long the preinfusion would last. However, I tried multiple times and regardless of how long I pushed the button, the water always started to flow at around 7/8 seconds. Is this normal or am I doing something wrong?
2. What is the normal volume for a double espresso? I know you usually calculate by weight, rather than volume but I am a bit confused. My yield with 18g of beans was 36 g of espresso, about 40 ml (approx, taking into account the crema layer) in 25 seconds. However, the Sage manual says that a double shot is supposed to be 60 ml?
3. Would you recommend changing the programme so you don't have to time your shots anymore or just always use manual?
4. I've read that the pressure gauge is just an indication and the timing, taste etc. should be your main guidance. However, as a beginner it does feel like the gauge is helpful even though. Is it normal that my espresso always stays around 11 o clock? Would it be better if it was further up in the espresso range

1h75jgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1h75jgn/humans_are_peaceful_conquerors_their_border/,"Humans are PEACEFUL Conquerors, their border expands with every fool that tests them. ","To call the Federation a ""Federation"" is more of a misnomer, it's more of a pleasant flavor of Vassal States under Humanity's heel. 

Do not get me wrong, Humanity doesn't vassalize EVERY species who tests them, species like the Gornud, Druka, and the Lokus were all purged to either endangered or extinct status. 

But the reason why all the ""vassals"" of the Federation have no qualms is because being conquered by Humans brought a huge change. 

Specifically the fact that they were not 2nd class citizens. 

This was due to Humanitarian Law, a law that stipulates every being under the wing of the Federation was equal. 

The only difference was one's responsibilities. 

A simple example are the Vladiri. 

A race of hemovores, already a bad and uncomfortable sign among many species. They were of medium height, below 2 meters and consumed a diet of mostly blood and marrow. 

Their race did not consume blood and marrow out of religious reasons, but it is because that is how they evolved. 

No fault of their own, and with species being openly  hostile, it made them very violent, often falling back to stealing and raiding food stocks of other animals via transports. 

The worst of them succumbed to animalistic behavior and tainted their minds with the addiction of blood and marrow from other sapient beings. 

So when Humanity's borders expanded, reaching the end of Vladiri space, conflict was soon to arise due to Human blood being a particular favorite. 

The Vladiri prepared for war, and Humanity offered peace. 

But it failed, the elites were addicted to stealing and driving their species to further fall into depravity. 

The war was brief, if you could even call it that, fleet upon fleet of Vladiri raiding ships were destroyed by fleets of Human frigates, boarding was ineffective due to the thick hull and redundant first layer armor that absorbed their boarding torpedoes, the entrances meeting cold space as the drill head opened. 

Planetside, Human weapons far outranged blasters as Artillery bombarded their fortresses. 

The last of the Vladiri government, holed up with their most fanatic loyal followers were slaughtered to the last by Human soldiers. 

The Vladiri were expecting to be wiped out. 

But instead, Humanity studied them, volunteers from POW camps have been helping Humans understand their physiology and culture on a scale not even known to the Vladiri themselves. 

Humanity proposed an offer to the civilian populace, accept the Federation's offer of having a seat in the Senate, as equals. And then Humanity will provide them blood and recipes for their people. 

The Vladiri renounced their old species' name and accepted the Vladiri name, called so after the most famous Human Vampire in history. 

They found themselves with the non-envious job of consuming donated Human blood that was about to go bad. 

Added to the fact that a lot of Earth Animals could be decent substitutes for blood, a lot of free range animals were now being cared for by the Vladiri, when the animals are slaughtered, the blood is harvested and sold in the Vladiri markets while the meat is sold to other species, the marrow is also harvested by the bucketload. 

A contributing factor that prevents the Vladiri from collapsing back to barbarism is that their food variety has not just increased exponentially, but that Humanity, the founders of the Federation, were also into blood-related food. 

This ranged from blood cakes to blood based soups. 

Vladiri who thought they would spend their entire lives consuming only blood, could now enjoy blood cocktails mixed with spices that formerly only the elite ever enjoyed. 

While it took a few decades for other species to accept the Vladiri, it was a huge success. 

Now Vladiri children with other species play in parks, enjoy coffee and tea, and thanks to Humanity's genetic tampering by splicing DNA from Vladiri/Human Hybrids cause Humans of course WOULD, have allowed Vladiri to slowly transition from a strict blood-only diet to incorporating normal food into their species' genetic bank. 

Now, nearly 400 years later, anyone who is discriminatory towards Vladiri were probably old veterans from other species that were alive over 400 years ago. 

They, just like any other species in the Federation, are treated no differently from any other species. 

Yes Humanity conquered their worlds, destabilized their government, and massacred the top elite of their race, but in return, 400 years later, the Vladiri are on equal footing with Humanity as some of the best Search and Rescue workers in every facet of the Federation.

# Essential Steps for Transforming Shipping Containers into a Thriving Restaurant

When turning shipping containers into a restaurant, it‚Äôs important to think about a few main things to make sure the change works well and the restaurant runs smoothly:

1. **Make Sure It‚Äôs Strong**: Check that the shipping container is tough enough for a restaurant. You might need to strengthen walls, floors, and ceilings to make sure it‚Äôs safe and meets the rules.
2. **Plan the Space**: Think about how to arrange everything so there‚Äôs enough room and it feels nice to eat there. Place the kitchen, seating area, tables, bathrooms, and service areas smartly to make everything work well.
3. **Keep It Comfy**: Good insulation helps control the temperature and saves energy. Also, make sure there‚Äôs plenty of fresh air to keep the place from getting stuffy and to get rid of kitchen smells.
4. **Water and Power**: Figure out how to get water in and out for sinks and bathrooms. Make a plan for all the electric stuff needed like lights, kitchen gear, and air conditioning.
5. **Get Permission**: You need the right permits to turn a shipping container into a restaurant. Make sure you follow local rules about building, health, fire safety, and making the place easy to access.
6. **Pick the Right Kitchen Stuff**: Choose strong kitchen equipment that fits your menu and the space. Think about how much electricity they will need.
7. **Decorate**: Make the place look cool and match your restaurant‚Äôs theme. Use colors, decorations, and signs to make it stand out and appeal to your customers.
8. **Easy to Get In**: Make sure everyone can get into your restaurant, including people with disabilities. Add ramps or rails if needed and make sure it‚Äôs safe with things like fire extinguishers and clear exits.
9. **Trash Talk**: Plan how to deal with leftovers, packaging, and other trash. Look for ways to recycle, compost, and throw away waste without taking up too much space.

By thinking about these points carefully, you can turn a shipping container into a cool and successful restaurant.

I‚Äôm a bus driver which means I‚Äôve got a lot of free time to think (obviously concentrating on the road) but most of the time my heads wandering and I can‚Äôt keep a thought for more than a few seconds, random thoughts about anything from ways to make money to random memories, I also randomly have phrases I‚Äôve heard over the day (usually the last words I‚Äôd said or heard) play in my head over and over.

Other things I‚Äôve noticed is if I have a task to do at home (cleaning, a hobby or project ect) I cannot do it without at least strong coffees and a podcast playing and even then there is no organisation to the method, I‚Äôll be washing up then half finish and wipe the sides just to go back to washing up. 

The worst is when I‚Äôm working on my project car, I‚Äôll be halfway through a small job then think it‚Äôll be easier with a different tool or to make one for it, then to find myself making a tool, realising it won‚Äôt work then going back to the original way. Or even worse get completely sidetracked on something else. 

I find it hard to read big blocks of text so I‚Äôll just skim the first sentence of each paragraph but end up completely giving up on reading it. 

I also sometimes find it hard to be motivated to do anything despite really wanting to do something.

Well it's not always as easy as that. I have certainly taken that approach with catcalling on the street, but can you do it to someone who holds a figure of power above you? Or even it's just your senior at work? Without sounding like you're blown things out of proportion? Or perhaps you think you could be mistaken and you can ruin someone's life for an accusation?
Here's my story, or one of the less obvious cases of harassment that I lived and I couldn't do anything, or almost anything.
I was 27, so not a child and I was in a extended visit for my PhD to a french research centre. My dream job. On the first day there's this overly friendly guy that asks too much questions about where I was going to live, but wanted to know the exact address, also was asking me if I had plans for dinner, I thought ok maybe he's a friendly coworker but it was just my first day at my flat and I wanted to get a few things from the supermarket and unpack. He insists that I go to his place and he cooks for me, I politely decline.

He then says he has to pick up some stuff in the supermarket as well and he can walk with me, I said ok , this was before we all had Google maps on our phones so at least I wouldn't get lost, so I thought..
The guy starts following me for all aisles and wouldn't leave until I had finished and he walked me home. I couldn't tell at the time if he was a stalker or a cultural difference I'm not aware of (guy is not french)

Then as the weeks go by, there was more subtle things that I couldn't really class as creepy, but maybe misogynistic? Like expecting me to make coffee for him and everyone.
But also the conversations early on was to try and find out if I was in a relationship, if it was serious. I couldn't escape most of these because we shared an office. I wanted to tell my boss but I was afraid they would tell me oh he's just friendly.
One of the girls in the office picked up on the kind of questions he was asking and asked if I was ok because I looked uncomfortable and he's not usually that pushy. So I told her about the walk on my first day and the very personal questions. She said nothing at the time. 
At the next lunch he asks only me if I have plans for the weekend, I had but I didn't want to tell him, and I said no, he said now you have and you go sightseeing with me.. and then I said actually I'm supposed to video call my boyfriend the whole day. He then said oh I don't know why a man can leave his girlfriend travel alone.
A few hours later, this other colleague makes sure I overhear her and asks if the gift she sent to his wife and son had arrived.. yes, he creepy guy had a family but they were back in their country 
So this is when I spoke up to my manager who was also his supervisor. I tried to frame it as I don't know if I'm not understanding a cultural difference but I'm not used to that kind of attention..
As I thought it would happen, guys have eachother's back. Manager acknowledged it was a  weird behaviour but this is a nice guy, and I shouldn't worry because his contract is running out and he's about to go back home to work on his university

For years I've been thinking how creepy this guy may be with his female students, I had a few creepy professors as well.. and how difficult it is to speak up because people may not believe you or gaslight you.

At the time both my dad and boyfriend wanted me to speak up, and both were worried sick, but I was worried about losing my PhD for this ",1,1733390985.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I hope you‚Äôre so caught up and preoccupied with living and fulfilling and future planning that bunnyaintno is barely remembered. I missed your birthday, so happy birthday. I think you‚Äôve hit one year sober. I imagine you must feel so proud of that, it‚Äôs such a big achievement dude. I‚Äôm sober(ish) too. Have been for a while. I don‚Äôt even drink coffee anymore unless it‚Äôs decaf. Now that I‚Äôve stopped I realized how anxious and sweaty caffeine made me and I hate being anxious and I rrreeeaally hate being sweaty. Most days I feel a little high and mighty about trading my nightly red wine for herbal tea but if I care to get truly introspective I actually hate it. God having a fuzzy mind all the time felt better. 

It‚Äôs 2:30 in the morning and I can‚Äôt sleep at all. You‚Äôre always on my mind and it‚Äôs so fucking embarrassing. I‚Äôm embarrassed by that all the time. You should be faded - something that crops up when there‚Äôs a blatant reminder. That‚Äôs just not how it is for me, and I‚Äôm so scared it will always be like this. I don‚Äôt want that. I want to erase you. I want to forget how well you knew every part of me, how so bizarrely connected we were (are? Who fucking knows). I want a reason to hate you or, better yet, god what I wouldn‚Äôt give to feel indifferent. Maybe if I could eternal sunshine myself I‚Äôd be happy instead of fine, ok, Good Enough. I hope I‚Äôm alone here in this impossible space and that the life you have now is your Maximum Happy. 

It‚Äôs all so goddamn complicated trying to navigate these thoughts while being so incredibly thankful for my daughter who wouldn‚Äôt be here had things gone differently. She is incredible. I yelled at her tonight. She deserves every ounce of patience and attention and kindness I have in me and I lost sight of that tonight. You know what? It was easy to do in the moment, to vocalize my anger. How shitty is that. I told myself that she won‚Äôt remember me getting so frustrated that I yelled and like, what a slippery fucking slope. She is not my emotional punching bag. Being a part time single parent is a totally different form of loneliness that I didn‚Äôt see coming and some days I‚Äôm not as good at coping. But dude, she‚Äôs a really special kid. I‚Äôve heard that from a lot of different people and I believe them when they tell me there‚Äôs just something about her that already sets her apart. She‚Äôs so so funny. She‚Äôs also defiant and curious and really musically inclined and very smart. I hate that I can‚Äôt control the world for her. I hate raising her in St. Louis. A few weeks ago a 16 year old boy was killed here. He was the passenger in his dad‚Äôs car and was hit by a stray bullet while they were driving down the interstate. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Just before giving birth I had a pretty lengthy therapy session because I couldn‚Äôt fathom driving with my child in the car. It seems like the most realistic way for her to be taken away and losing her is not something I would plan to survive. Sometimes I can‚Äôt even take her for a walk because intrusive thoughts of awful things win out and I know for a fact a distracted driver will not hit us in the living room. 

I‚Äôm medicated now. 200mg in the morning and another 50 at night but I‚Äôm out of my evening prescription and I‚Äôm waiting on it to be delivered. I hope that‚Äôs not why I got angry. I need to be responsible on my own for that and keep it in check. 


I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll read this, and I don‚Äôt think I want to know if you do. I won‚Äôt directly reach out to you and I‚Äôm not necessarily looking for anything. But typing all this out - a whole lot of nothing and a little bit of something - has helped more than I thought. I guess I just needed to put this word vomit stream of consciousness into the universe and maybe then I can stop daydreaming about conversations we never had. Just leave some of it here to collect cobwebs so my head can move in forward motion. 
The tldr of it all is that I love you then, still, and probably always will. It makes me really fucking mad. ",1,1733390630.0,u_BunnyAintNo,0,1.0,False

But after reading up on¬†*Nagano Tonic*¬†and seeing its ingredient profile, I thought, ‚ÄúWhy not give it one last shot?‚Äù What‚Äôs different about this tonic, I found, is its blend of ancient, natural ingredients that target weight management by addressing the root causes of weight gain: stress, metabolism, and even cravings.

Within the first week, I felt an unexpected surge of energy. Not the jittery, caffeinated kind, but a stable, steady stamina. I‚Äôd start my mornings with a glass of water mixed with¬†*Nagano Tonic*, which easily became a refreshing part of my morning routine. That sense of sustained energy kept me productive throughout the day and helped me stay consistent with my goals without needing an afternoon nap or extra coffee.

By the second week, I noticed my cravings had mellowed out‚Äîa huge win for me. I didn‚Äôt have the usual urge to snack, especially on sugary treats, which had always been a struggle. This change wasn‚Äôt instant, but I realized I was naturally gravitating towards more balanced meals without forcing it. A blend of ingredients like ashwagandha and EGCG from green tea seemed to be doing their job, subtly supporting my body in ways I didn‚Äôt think were possible. My overall mood was better too, and that made sticking to healthier choices easier.

Then came the weight loss. After a month, my clothes started fitting better, and the scale showed I‚Äôd lost a noticeable amount of weight without a strict diet or grueling workouts. My body felt lighter, my digestion had improved, and I was even sleeping better‚Äîpossibly thanks to the adaptogenic herbs that help regulate stress and cortisol. By month three, I had dropped nearly 20 pounds, a milestone I hadn‚Äôt reached in years, even when I was doing intensive workouts.

One thing I appreciated was that¬†*Nagano Tonic*¬†isn‚Äôt marketed as a miracle weight-loss solution. Instead, it targets sustainable health, blending natural superfoods like camu camu and mangosteen that work with the body to boost metabolism, lower inflammation, and support overall vitality. Unlike other products that left me feeling deprived or anxious,¬†*Nagano Tonic*¬†felt gentle but effective.

For me,¬†*Nagano Tonic*¬†has become more than a supplement. It‚Äôs a system that helped me restore balance in my body, naturally curb cravings, boost my energy, and support healthy weight loss. I didn‚Äôt have to make radical changes; I simply added this tonic into my routine. It‚Äôs safe to say that it‚Äôs been one of the best investments in my health journey.

The science behind¬†*Nagano Tonic*¬†lies in its careful selection of natural ingredients, each chosen for its unique contribution to metabolism, energy, and weight management. This formula draws on traditional ingredients, blending them into a tonic that supports the body‚Äôs natural processes to promote a healthier, leaner physique without extreme diets or workouts. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into some of these powerful components and how they work together.

One of the standout ingredients is¬†**Camu Camu**, a superfood high in vitamin C and antioxidants. Known for centuries in traditional medicine, camu camu works by boosting metabolism and offering a steady energy lift without caffeine. Its antioxidants also help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which are often underlying contributors to weight gain and sluggishness. This allows the body to process fats and sugars more efficiently, directly supporting weight loss efforts.

Then there‚Äôs¬†**Mangosteen**, a nutrient-packed fruit rich in fiber, which aids in feeling full and supports a balanced digestive system. This natural fiber not only promotes satiety but also enhances digestion, helping the body process and eliminate waste effectively. Mangosteen is also noted for containing xanthones, which have anti-inflammatory properties. By reducing inflammation, mangosteen may help improve metabolic health, making it easier to shed excess weight and maintain energy.

**EGCG**, a catechin found in green tea, is one of the most well-documented antioxidants. EGCG boosts metabolism and aids in fat burning, as several studies have shown. By increasing the thermogenic effect (the rate at which the body burns calories to produce heat), EGCG can amplify calorie-burning even without exercise. Furthermore, it‚Äôs known to enhance the body‚Äôs resilience to oxidative stress, another factor in maintaining a healthy metabolism.

A unique aspect of¬†*Nagano Tonic*¬†is its use of¬†**adaptogenic herbs**¬†like¬†**Ashwagandha**¬†and¬†**Panax Ginseng**. Adaptogens help the body adapt to stress by stabilizing cortisol levels, which are often elevated in response to stress and can lead to fat storage, particularly around the abdomen. Ashwagandha is especially beneficial in managing cortisol, which in turn can reduce stress-induced cravings. Panax Ginseng, on the other hand, enhances vitality and supports mental clarity by helping regulate blood sugar, which may reduce the likelihood of energy crashes and associated cravings.

Lastly,¬†**Momordica Charantia**, commonly known as bitter melon, plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism. Bitter melon has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to use sugars more efficiently for energy instead of storing them as fat. This is particularly helpful for those who struggle with blood sugar management or experience sugar cravings.

*Nagano Tonic*¬†isn‚Äôt just a weight loss supplement‚Äîit‚Äôs a multi-dimensional health tonic that supports the body‚Äôs metabolic and hormonal systems holistically. By integrating these scientifically backed ingredients, it offers a natural path to sustainable energy, effective metabolism, and balanced weight management.

She was charming, enigmatic, and had an intensity about her that both fascinated and unnerved him. Their relationship burned hot and fast, but the cracks began to show after a few months. Lila became possessive and jealous, often accusing Eric of hiding things from her.

When Eric finally broke things off, she didn‚Äôt take it well. There were dramatic late-night calls, long emails oscillating between apologies and threats, and even a few unannounced visits to his dorm. Eventually, things quieted down. Lila stopped reaching out, and Eric assumed she‚Äôd moved on.

Years passed. Eric graduated, started a job, and began dating someone new. His life seemed to be falling into place until the day he found the first letter.

It was slipped under his apartment door, written in a familiar, looping script.

*""I‚Äôve missed you. You can‚Äôt run from us forever.""*

There was no signature, but Eric‚Äôs stomach sank. He recognized Lila‚Äôs handwriting immediately.

Trying to keep calm, Eric told himself it was a coincidence. She couldn‚Äôt possibly have found his new address. He brushed it off as a prank‚Äîuntil the letters kept coming.

They arrived every few days, each more unnerving than the last.

*""Do you think she loves you like I do?""*  
*""I saw you at the grocery store. You looked good in that blue shirt.""*  
*""You don‚Äôt belong to her. You belong to me.""*

The details were what terrified Eric the most. The letters described his daily life with unsettling accuracy‚Äîwhat time he left for work, what he bought at the store, even the songs he hummed while making coffee.

One night, Eric came home to find his living room window open, even though he was sure he‚Äôd locked it before leaving. On his kitchen table was a framed photo of him and Lila from years ago, a large X scratched over the glass.

Eric contacted the police, but without any direct threats or proof, they couldn‚Äôt do much. He changed his locks, installed cameras, and tried to move on, though he constantly felt like he was being watched.

Then came the night she showed herself.

Eric woke up around 3 a.m. to a faint rustling sound. Groggy, he stumbled out of bed, his heart pounding as he grabbed the baseball bat he kept by the door. Following the sound, he reached the living room‚Äîand froze.

Lila was standing there, barefoot and disheveled, staring at him with wide, unblinking eyes. She was holding a knife in one hand and one of his shirts in the other, pressing it to her face as if to inhale his scent.

‚ÄúLila, what the hell‚Äî‚Äù he began, but she cut him off.

‚ÄúYou said you loved me,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúYou promised.‚Äù

Eric tried to reason with her, keeping his voice calm, but her expression darkened.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let you leave again,‚Äù she said, stepping closer.

Terrified, Eric ran to his bedroom, slamming the door behind him. He dialed 911, his hands shaking so badly he nearly dropped his phone. From the other side of the door, he heard her voice:

‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt have you, no one can.‚Äù

When the police arrived, Lila was gone. All they found was the knife she‚Äôd left on his bed, along with a note scrawled on the wall in lipstick:

*""Forever together.""*

Eric moved to a new city a week later, but the story didn‚Äôt end there. Months after the incident, his new girlfriend found a package on their doorstep. Inside was a single polaroid photo of Eric sleeping, taken from inside their bedroom.

On the back of the photo were the words: *‚ÄúI‚Äôll always find you.‚Äù*",1,1733390361.0,u_Original_Leopard_624,0,1.0,False

I honestly don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôve made some very strange connection in my mind, or if there‚Äôs actually some logic here that I just can‚Äôt figure out.
Over the past five years, I‚Äôve had the chance to use 20+ different smartwatches (for work-related reasons), and generally, I haven‚Äôt gone a day without wearing one.

Two years ago, I got my first Garmin smartwatch (either Venu 2 or 3), and as soon as I put it on my wrist, I felt weird. At the time, I blamed it on a seasonal cold, and since I didn‚Äôt like the watch, I didn‚Äôt use it anymore.
In the meantime, I tried the FitBit Charge 5. Exactly the same thing happened. Since I only had the watch for a very short time, I didn‚Äôt wear it much and didn‚Äôt think too much about it.

Fast forward to this year. I was really, really looking forward to the Pixel Watch 3 launch and was among the first in line at the store. I had never used a Pixel watch before, and being a Google fangirl, this was a big deal for me.
Lo and behold‚Ä¶ the Pixel Watch caused the same reaction. As soon as I put the watch on, I felt this strange internal trembling. A bit similar to the feeling you get after drinking too much coffee. And on top of that, I felt slightly nauseous.

I tried living with the watch for 3 weeks, but eventually, it started triggering constant anxiety.
I put the Pixel Watch in the drawer and borrowed my husband‚Äôs Galaxy Watch 7, and since then, I haven‚Äôt had any such issues.

I have three theories:

1. If I remember correctly, all three of these watches (Garmin Venu, FitBit Charge 5, and Pixel Watch) have a metal backplate‚Äîcould that be causing a reaction?


2. These watches might use some slightly different technology/frequencies?


3. It‚Äôs 100% all in my head.


Has anyone else experienced something similar?

My wife and I moved from a Profitec Go to Linea Micra. We drink only milk based drinks (all day long, sorry for offending any Italians here), and we love to invite a lot of friends and coworkers over for coffee, so we needed a dual boiler with plenty of steam power. We moved from using an ECM bottomless protafilter to the included La Marzzoco bottomless one included with our new machine.

Personally, I think its an improvement, as it takes a lot less time to heat up, however, it's compatibility with my Mignon Specialita grinder is not great. Due to the sides being machined off, it won't stay in the grinder without falling out. It will stay in the grinder with the included shot splitter, but I do not wish to use it, nor take it on and off every time I grind.

Moving to a dosing cup could be a feasible solution, but the¬†[The Mignon single dose kit](https://www.eureka.co.it/en/accessory/id/167.aspx)¬†is a terrible value for 90 euros (I know, kind of hypocritical coming from the guy who purchased a Linea Micra) as we would not use the included hopper, since we don't single dose in this house, especially when making 6 lattes in a row.

Since we only need the fork and dosing cup, I asked Eureka costumer support if they would sell me the ""all purpose fork"" on its own, and they declined.

Losing hope, I ask you for solutions to this issue I have created for myself, as this is one of the most popular grinder, and it is known the best tips come from reddit.

Do you have a similar issue? Have you solved it? What equipement did you buy? Is all hope lost and I need to add another 90 euros to my setup?

I got my pre 2015 Gaggia classic the other day and the seller has demonstrated everything functions properly.  The unit has a PID regulator installed by a professional and a rancillio steam wand.   
The water was coming out of the group head fairly quickly and in decent manner, steam was working fine.   
He made a shot using his setup and it was OK (his grinder is fairly bad quality and we didn't measure time).  
On the machine I now have the original portafilter and I think 18g cup. The device was descaled and backflushed prior to my purchase. (btw, I paid 220 euros for it)

My grinder is manual; Timemore C3 ESP pro, I think that  will do the job nicely?

The only thing I didn't receive with the machine is the tamper. However, since that is kinda tied to the portafilter, and to the portafilter the baskets are tied, I wanted to create this thread to ask about if I should upgrade any of those from the get go.

One thing I am not understanding, is why are people generally against single baskets?  
I really don't want to be grinding 18g of coffee, and especially I don't want to be consuming that much caffeine. Are there 12g basket on the market and are those still considered single? Thinking about the amount, I'd be the happiest with 12g, since that's what I usually grind to make my Turkish coffee.

I prefer to drink ratios towards Lungo, 1:3 or something like that, if that matters for this discussion?

We just got into a two hour long argument about our relationship dynamic and how it‚Äôs changed so much. I‚Äôd give the full conversation but honestly I‚Äôm  exhausted. 

Here are some of the main points: 

- he feels unhappy and unloved because I don‚Äôt do the little things anymore (flowers, coffee dates, dinner dates) 
- I was aroused sexually by someone else, but failed to be aroused by my husbands days prior to encounter 
- my emotional and mental attraction has been damaged 
- I‚Äôve talked to a person in the past who he didn‚Äôt want me to, crossed that boundary
- he crossed the boundary of giving oral to another guy despite saying we couldn‚Äôt physically see people, and he‚Äôs using my crossed boundary to justify his crossed boundary isn‚Äôt that bad 
- he doesn‚Äôt see me as the same man he married because of the successful sex with another person that wasn‚Äôt him 
- he wasn‚Äôt satisfied sexually by me, which drove the openness 
- I feel less desire to satisfy him sexually given I‚Äôve been cheated on
- he unfollowed my Instagram and allowed our 800 days streak die on Snapchat 
- I‚Äôve slept with other people, so has he, willingly and knowingly, but he FEELS like I‚Äôve cheated on
- I can‚Äôt get him to understand that my lack of sexual arousal is being hindered by the emotional trauma I have from being cheated on. 
- I feel so much pressure to be erect during sex that it get in my own head about. It being able to please him 
- doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to help me with my mental and emotional issues caused by him because he can‚Äôt help himself 
- cannot guarantee that he won‚Äôt talk to other people if we go back to expensive cause he thinks he‚Äôll still be unhappy sexually 
- I could be a better husband but I know I‚Äôm holding on to these trust issues that I have 
- he has trust issues with me and I feel like I have to defend everything I say cause he doesn‚Äôt believe me 
- we‚Äôre at each others throat time and time again trying to resolve these issues 
- I don‚Äôt feel appreciated for being so accommodating and ultimately being strong armed into an open relationship
- now that we‚Äôre open I don‚Äôt mind it because instead of it happening behind my back at least it‚Äôs in front of me
- is open to couples therapy but isn‚Äôt convinced it‚Äôs going to make me a better husband 

I‚Äôm trying. I‚Äôm reallllly trying. I don‚Äôt want to give up, but I‚Äôm losing hope. Would a couple weeks of separation help? Does this seem like a lost cause? Should we just file for a divorce? I‚Äôm so stressed out. ",1,1733388763.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

I hold a Master‚Äôs degree and currently work in project management. I transitioned from a finance career that didn‚Äôt spark much joy for me, and I‚Äôm so glad I made the shift! I hope to meet someone who‚Äôs passionate about what they do‚Äîor at least finds satisfaction in it.

**For Fun:**

* I‚Äôm a traveler at heart‚Äîlove exploring new places, trying new foods, attending concerts, and meeting people. Simple outings like a coffee date or grabbing a beer are just as fun.
* Secretly (or not-so-secretly), I fancy myself a pretty good cook. Let‚Äôs have a friendly cook-off sometime!
* I just built my first PC and have been diving into gaming‚ÄîLeague, horror, co-op, strategy, survival, crafting‚Ä¶ basically, I‚Äôm open to anything.

**Serious Stuff:**

* I adore children and hope to have some of my own one day‚Äîso it‚Äôd be great if you share that vision.
* Faith-wise, I‚Äôm Catholic, though not very strict about it. If shared values matter to you, that‚Äôs a bonus. If not, no worries‚ÄîI respect other beliefs in friendships.

I think that‚Äôs enough for now. Can‚Äôt spill all my secrets at once, right? üòä

If any of this resonates with you, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Please include a picture if you‚Äôre comfortable‚ÄîI don‚Äôt mind sharing one too. After all, a little spark never hurts!

No hard feelings if I‚Äôm not your vibe and vice versa‚Äîgood luck in your search. (Though, for the record, I do love coffee!)

Could therapy help? Separation?,"TL;DR backstory - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/KMrapPL3iw

We just got into a two hour long argument about our relationship dynamic and how it‚Äôs changed so much. I‚Äôd give the full conversation but honestly I‚Äôm  exhausted. 

Here are some of the main points: 

- he feels unhappy and unloved because I don‚Äôt do the little things anymore (flowers, coffee dates, dinner dates) 
- I was aroused sexually by someone else, but failed to be aroused by my husbands days prior to encounter 
- my emotional and mental attraction has been damaged 
- I‚Äôve talked to a person in the past who he didn‚Äôt want me to, crossed that boundary
- he crossed the boundary of giving oral to another guy despite saying we couldn‚Äôt physically see people, and he‚Äôs using my crossed boundary to justify his crossed boundary isn‚Äôt that bad 
- he doesn‚Äôt see me as the same man he married because of the successful sex with another person that wasn‚Äôt him 
- he wasn‚Äôt satisfied sexually by me, which drove the openness 
- I feel less desire to satisfy him sexually given I‚Äôve been cheated on
- he unfollowed my Instagram and allowed our 800 days streak die on Snapchat 
- I‚Äôve slept with other people, so has he, willingly and knowingly, but he FEELS like I‚Äôve cheated on
- I can‚Äôt get him to understand that my lack of sexual arousal is being hindered by the emotional trauma I have from being cheated on. 
- I feel so much pressure to be erect during sex that it get in my own head about. It being able to please him 
- doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to help me with my mental and emotional issues caused by him because he can‚Äôt help himself 
- cannot guarantee that he won‚Äôt talk to other people if we go back to expensive cause he thinks he‚Äôll still be unhappy sexually 
- I could be a better husband but I know I‚Äôm holding on to these trust issues that I have 
- he has trust issues with me and I feel like I have to defend everything I say cause he doesn‚Äôt believe me 
- we‚Äôre at each others throat time and time again trying to resolve these issues 
- I don‚Äôt feel appreciated for being so accommodating and ultimately being strong armed into an open relationship
- now that we‚Äôre open I don‚Äôt mind it because instead of it happening behind my back at least it‚Äôs in front of me
- is open to couples therapy but isn‚Äôt convinced it‚Äôs going to make me a better husband 

I‚Äôm trying. I‚Äôm reallllly trying. I don‚Äôt want to give up, but I‚Äôm losing hope. Would a couple weeks of separation help? Does this seem like a lost cause? Should we just file for a divorce? I‚Äôm so stressed out. ",1,1733388611.0,u_ThrowRA9132x,0,1.0,False
1h74uxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h74uxj/i_have_been_seeing_this_guy_for_almost_a_year/,I have been seeing this guy for almost a year. Needing a fresh set of opinions on the situation. I know this is a long one but please be patient with me and give me advice! ,"Hello, I (34 F) have been seeing this guy (39 M) for almost a year now. Since mid January 2024 to be exact. We will call him Kevin. 

A little back story about me: I am a single mom with a 12 year old son. I was with my son‚Äôs dad since I was a freshman in high school. We were together for a total of about 12 years. We broke up when my son was about six years old in February of 2018. Two months later in April 2018 I met my ex fianc√©. January 2023, my fianc√© of five years and I broke up. He broke up with me to start dating a girl from his work. I basically was kicked out of my home and moved into a two bedroom apartment with my son. So basically, since I was a freshman in high school, I have never fully gotten comfortable with living on my own and just being by myself and getting to know who I want to be and who I am as a person. I have pretty much always been in a relationship with someone. My son‚Äôs dad has been on a downhill spiral since we broke up. And is very seldom a part of my son‚Äôs life and that‚Äôs his own fault of just choosing not to be there. He joined the military after we broke up, got married, had another kid and started excessively drinking and due to his drinking was kicked out of the army now has no job. I‚Äôm not getting any child support and my son is emotionally affected by this. 

My ex fianc√© was very emotionally and mentally abusive. He and I were eight years apart. So he was about eight years older than me. He was definitely a narcissist. It took me a while to recognize and accept that I was in that kind of relationship. I am still healing from that relationship as he kept coming back to me even though he started dating someone from his work the same week we broke up and basically tormented me for that first year that we were broken up. It took a year for me to get over him officially. We finally went no contact recently for good. Christmas a year ago was really hard because it was my first Christmas that I was not in a relationship with someone. I was severely depressed a year ago. And due to my trauma bond to my ex for a long time, I allowed him to consistently come back to me only to tug at my heart strings, get what he wanted from me, and then discard me to be with his new supply. It‚Äôs a long story for a different thread, but my son was witness to a lot of of emotional trauma that I went through because of that relationship. 

To add to all of this, I have never been married, I have been in a 12 year relationship and a five year relationship with two different men two months apart. Now it has almost been two years since I have even been in a committed relationship. I am finally starting to learn to love me again and be happy in my own skin with who I am. I have even started focusing more on my career goals especially going in to 2025. I have a lot of hobbies, friends, and career goals, and aspirations keeping me plenty busy. So there is no need for a relationship with someone because I am so content with myself right now. But of course, I am still open to being in a relationship with someone, Should the opportunity present itself. 

That first year when my fianc√© broke my heart, I dated excessively  from every dating app that you can probably think of. Because being with someone and having that connection was all I knew. And I was broken. I hooked up with quite a few of them. And none of those connections turned into anything past a few dates. As I said, before, my ex came around a lot, even though we were not together, and he toyed with my emotions and took advantage of that when he wasn‚Äôt getting what he needed from his current girlfriend. So I was on dating apps pretty much right after he and I broke up in January 2023 to September 2023. Then I was off dating apps for quite a while because my ex was hanging around a lot, and I was trying to be there for him as his friend, which was of course my mistake because it only made things much worse. And if you were asking yourself if he and I were hooking up as well while he was with his girlfriend, the answer to that is yes of course, unfortunately. I take full accountability for allowing myself to let him in. And I was hurt over and over again in that process. I think that I was finally off dating apps at that time because I held onto hope that he and I might eventually get back together. Then we went no contact the end of November and December was when I was severely depressed in the aftermath of that situation. 

When the new year started, I went on dating apps again. I even hooked up with a couple of different people again. Then I came across Kevin‚Äôs profile on Hinge. He seemed different than most guys I had dated over the last year and we matched instantly, he was the only one I matched with that time around on the app so far. We made plans to have dinner at his house The night after we started talking. He seemed really nice and charming and funny. 

He made us both dinner when I came over  and here‚Äôs what I found out about him. He was married before to Alice. She cheated on him twice. The first time he tried to make their marriage work, the second time he couldn‚Äôt do it so they got a divorce. She and him have two younger kids together. 5 & 7 I think. He got to keep the house due to her infidelity and they have a strict parenting plan. He gets to see his kids on his two days off from work Mondays and Tuesdays. 

After his divorce, he was very broken and lonely and that‚Äôs when he met Jill on a dating app. Jill has four kids with three men. Her oldest is 16 and her youngest is four. Kevin and Jill were together for about 15 months total. She was pregnant twice when they were together both ending in a miscarriage. One of which was almost full term when she lost it, and that was the hardest one for both of them. The last time he saw her was May 2023 when they were mourning the loss of their baby. Kevin has been in car sales for the last seven years. 

What I will say from that first date, my impression of Kevin was that he talked quite a lot about himself. He seemed very broken and unsure, and it was unclear why exactly he was on a dating app. He didn‚Äôt even really seem to know what he wanted at the time. But then again, neither did I, as I was still mourning my relationship with my ex. 

But Kevin and I talk on the phone nearly every day and we text too, but he‚Äôs more into actual phone conversations versus texting because of his job. He‚Äôs always on his phone sending emails and messaging so he prefers phone calls. Kevin and I have never had sex. This is a big one for me because I was hooking up with a lot of guys and Kevin has been the first guy that hasn‚Äôt tried to sleep with me. But that being said, I have given him oral plenty of times. He has never gone down on me, and has maybe only grabbed a boob during a blow job once and that was over my shirt. We typically only ever hang out at his house and have dinner and watch a movie. We have never gone out on a date and I think this is hugely due to his job and his hours that he works as well as the fact that he does not drink. He has been sober for at least a couple years now. 

Since our first date night at his house, I do a majority of the cooking for us, typically at my home in a crockpot that I bring over to him at his house. He has cooked for me on occasion, but due to his work schedule and him getting home late it has made the most sense for me to cook, which is why I have done so this entire time and I don‚Äôt mind that piece of it. But then it has also ended up with me bringing him coffees, and while he was working throughout his day, I was bringing him coffee in the middle of the day when he was working. And now our hangouts sometimes end up with me giving him massages because he has a bad back and yes, I have seen his manly area lol but I have not seen him fully naked. Let‚Äôs just say the dynamic of our relationship/situation is odd. And definitely not typical. 

We have had numerous conversations about the blowjob thing lol he has made jokes that having sex is how babies are made. He has also made other comments that marriage is not for him due to his divorce. He sees things differently. He is also a man of faith and I also go to church every Sunday. I have never spent the night over at his house. Yes I have fallen asleep next to him and then woken up and gone home but never have we spent the night together. And it‚Äôs never him calling me to come over for a booty call just to get his blowjob or whatever we hang out, we watch a movie, we cuddle, and then it for the most part for a while was ending in a blow job. He wasn‚Äôt even ever trying to kiss me for the first at least eight months. And let me tell you this was DRIVING ME INSANE! he usually walked me to the door at the end of the night gave me a hug goodbye and that was it‚Ä¶

While I have been talking to him, I have on occasion had sex with someone else because we are not together. Do I have feelings for him? Of course I do. But this whole dynamic that we have going on is confusing. We are friends, plus benefits in a way that are one-sided. Do I feel like he‚Äôs using me? At times it‚Äôs hard not to feel that way. But due to his work schedule and being in the car industry can be very unpredictable and at his current dealership when we first met, they weren‚Äôt meeting their numbers and he‚Äôs been stressing out about money. 

so I have had no problem, making dinners for us and sending him lunches to his work and getting him coffees and giving him a massage after a hard day and being there for him as his friend because he does call me quite a bit and he vents to me about a lot of things going on in his life and let me tell you this year has been really hard for him and he has been going through a lot more than I have known anyone to ever grow through in their life. 

So let‚Äôs take a pause for a minute and discuss something that happened in March of this year. We were hanging out one night and he got a call from his ex-wife about his daughter and that she was going to the ER. So we ended ourdate early. Then I didn‚Äôt really hear from him for about a week. It was really weird and I gave him an out. And he told me he was going to call me in a couple days and talk about what was going on with him. When we finally did get the opportunity to have a conversation, he told me that his ex Jill, just had their baby daughter. She was pregnant when he and I were on a dating app together. Because they lost the first two babies, he didn‚Äôt know for sure if the third baby was going to make it and being that he and I were not in a relationship, he didn‚Äôt say anything to me, but then again he didn‚Äôt really tell anyone that she was having a baby. At the time this did bother me and was unsettling one, that he didn‚Äôt tell me and two was hard for me to think about potentially dating someone with two baby mamas. Seemed like a lot of drama. 

But this whole time he and I have basically been really close in becoming pretty good friends, even though things have been going excruciatingly slow. Pretty soon after his baby was born, he got a new job as a sales manager, which was an hour away from where he lived, but near his ex. This was also that he could have a relationship with his newborn baby. Plus, he was stressed out about making money as a salesman and was able to make more of a steady income as a store manager. But here‚Äôs the catch‚Ä¶ because he didn‚Äôt want to drive 500+ miles per week and have this job, his sole purpose of having this job was to see his daughter and have a relationship with her, which was important to him, and I respected that but he was staying in his ex‚Äòs house. He was staying in the bedroom in her bed and she was staying on the couch with the baby. Despite what all of you may be thinking, I fully believe and trust that no they were not sleeping together and no, they were not having sex together at any point since they had created his daughter. 

I know this based on things he would tell me when he would vent to me about the situation with her. She was very controlling and they did not get along. They were not friends. She doesn‚Äôt respect him, and it was very hard for months for him to stay up there with her. 

So he has worked up there since May. We went from seeing each other at least twice sometimes three times a week to only seeing each other one day a week, which is usually on Sundays, which was his early night off from work that he would come home before getting his kids for his two days off. Sunday nights were our date night of having dinner and chilling out watching a movie at his house. 

We have had conversations about our dating situation. For a long time, he has expressed that he doesn‚Äôt have anything to give me right now. Yes he went on a dating app probably because he was lonely and he thought to try it out and see what was out there. Never expecting to meet anyone. But then he met me. His ex was having his baby. And he was barely living paycheck to paycheck due to his job with all the bills, he also had to take care of which included the insane amount of child support, he was paying his ex-wife when he was making a lot of money to the mortgage on his house as well. 

The most recent conversation we have had about our situation, is that I have asked him to let me know if he‚Äôs just not feeling it. I have also asked him. How will I know when he‚Äôs ready to take this to the next step? He has told me that he would tell me. He has expressed that he likes me a lot and has even said if he didn‚Äôt feel that way about me that he wouldn‚Äôt be consistently having me over to his house all the time. And I‚Äôm usually the first person he calls when he gets off work or has had a bad day or whatever. I think we could both easily say that we are pretty much best friends at this point. Plus, he gets blowjobs lol after everything I have said about our situation, the blowjobs are probably only about 5 to 10%. 

I have never sent him a nude photo and he has never asked me for one or sent me one. This dynamic is so different from anything that I‚Äôm used to. Maybe he is taking advantage. Maybe he‚Äôs just stringing me along to get what he wants from me without the commitment of a relationship. For the most part, he seems like a pretty honest guy. 

Since he got this management position in May, the entire summer, he was spending most of his weeks in the city for his job at his ex‚Äôs house.  They were basically playing house taking care of all of her kids because I think on some level he felt like he needed to since he was staying with her to see his baby. I think her treatment of him came from her resentment towards him. And ultimately he has at this point decided that he just doesn‚Äôt want to stay up there anymore and if he doesn‚Äôt get to see his baby, then he has accepted that it is what it is. 

She has refused to come down to his place with the baby and that‚Äôs why he originally decided to go all the way up there to see his baby whenever he could. Now she has sprung it on him that she wants him to take the baby Sunday nights when he goes home with his other kids because he has a parenting plan with his ex-wife and she wants one too. All of this has nothing to do with me because again we are not together, we are friends with some kind of benefits and now he actually kisses me before I go down on him, but I‚Äôm starting to feel like maybe he‚Äôs been kissing me before I go down on him to get me to go down on him because for a little bit I had stopped Giving him oral because I had expressed that I felt like I wasn‚Äôt getting anything from him in return and he enjoys cuddling and has talked about that he enjoys cuddling with me and he has definitely stepped up his game in kissing me since maybe September. He started staying back at his house during the week and just driving all the way up to work just over the last few weeks. Occasionally he has stayed with his ex. But ultimately he has decided he just doesn‚Äôt want to stay up there anymore. 

He put his house up on the market and it was probably up for sale for a month and a half to two months and now he just sold it and he should be getting quite a bit of income from selling his house because it didn‚Äôt make sense to him anymore to hang onto it when he wasn‚Äôt spending a lot of time being there. He‚Äôll be staying with some family friends who are an older couple until he figures out what to do next and that may be at least the next couple of months. 

I literally spent all day with him today, helping him clean his house from top to bottom and finish, emptying the rest of his house out to his storage unit. Originally he didn‚Äôt ask me for help until he‚Äôs been stressing out about everything last minute. He took a couple of days off work and agreed to let me help him and we spent the entire day together. 

I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen but I have brought it up occasionally for discussion about what‚Äôs going to happen for me and him and he has expressed that he doesn‚Äôt really have an answer to that right now but he has hinted that 2025 will hopefully be a better year for him now that he has sold this house and he won‚Äôt be living paycheck to paycheck anymore and is basically starting over fresh. Am I waiting for him? I don‚Äôt consider myself waiting because I am content with where I am in life right now, but of course I like him and maybe at some point I would be interested to see where this can go further but I‚Äôm also confused as to what that looks like because over this entire time that I‚Äôve known him, he has expressed me the entire time that he can‚Äôt really give me anything and so he hasn‚Äôt really given me anything. So I don‚Äôt know if this is who he even is? Or maybe I‚Äôm about to find out in 2025 after everything is closed and settled? And now he has also mentioned putting in a transfer to work closer to home now that the situation with his ex and seeing his baby has not been working and he just doesn‚Äôt want to do that anymore. 

Obviously, any decision that he has made has absolutely nothing to do with me. I guess I am just curious as to what you guys think? Am I wasting my time? Or have I even given this a real chance? Because I do feel like no woman in their right mind would still be here at this point. But like I said, I have been perfectly content with getting to know myself and I‚Äôm not needy or clingy if anything, he‚Äôs usually reaching out to me trying to plan for when to see me next. And he has made subtle comments that Things will be better for him in 2025. I guess I just need advice on what I should do? I feel like we are pretty close and I do care about him, but I also think that we have maintained a certain level of distance where no I haven‚Äôt fallen for him and I don‚Äôt think that he‚Äôs there at all with me, but I do see potential for that. I just think that we have both been severely hurt in our past relationships and haven‚Äôt wanted to rush into anything that we aren‚Äôt ready for.

To add onto us and not having sex, in the beginning, he made a comment that sex makes him fall pretty hard for someone and I think his connection to sex is by loving and caring for someone in that way. I definitely don‚Äôt think he takes it lightly and he has expressed not being into casual sex. I think he has a hard time having sex with someone he‚Äôs not in a relationship with. On the flipside of that, I have had conversations with my friends about this whole situation and they have given me as much advice as I can without telling me to just give up or throw in the towel yet. Because they understand my frustrations, but on the other side of it, it does come across selfish on his part. But for me oral for a girl seems pretty intimate and I‚Äôm not one that expects to get that from a guy unless we‚Äôre gonna have sex. 

Mind you, I‚Äôm not pushing for us to have sex. I recently also had a very close friend of mine die and so this past month has been brutal for me and he and I have hardly gotten to see each other because I told him I really needed to take care of myself right now and couldn‚Äôt be there for him. He understood that because he has had a lot of death in his life. I have not so I‚Äôve been really struggling this past month. I recently made some comments about having sex, and he joked back and said having sex when one is depressed, is not the best time lol 

We don‚Äôt really talk about having sex and he doesn‚Äôt really compliment my body in anyway or tell me that I look cute or beautiful or anything like that so it‚Äôs again it‚Äôs a weird dynamic. But he has said that he likes me and he seems to enjoy talking to me and has said so. I‚Äôm just confused because I feel like there‚Äôs some kind of disconnect there and I‚Äôm just wondering if maybe it‚Äôs because of what we went through in our past relationships maybe he respects me more and that‚Äôs why things are being drawn out this long like this? I guess I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how do I tread this situation from here on out? Do I take some steps back and see how he handles it? He won‚Äôt have a house of his own anymore. He‚Äôll be living with other people. They know me to be his friend. Which is fine. I know that he‚Äôs not talking to anyone else and I have also expressed to him that I‚Äôm not talking to anyone else nor am I interested in talking to anybody else and he has told me that if he didn‚Äôt see this going anywhere that I wouldn‚Äôt still be here. Should I be patient? Or should I take some steps back and really start friend zoning him to protect myself? We‚Äôre coming up on a year and I just don‚Äôt know how to navigate this.

After completing a raid with both 4 players and 8 players (using the current bug), I can say it is more enjoyable and manageable with 8 players.  
  
The current raid imposes a significant requirement to play in a specific way: wearing power armor, relying heavily on V.A.T.S. with a heavy weapon, and consuming an almost comical amount of coffee. It becomes a grind, burning through rounds and fusion cores, only to realize the team isn't working well together‚Äîleading to the abandonment of hours of effort.  
  
With 8 players, there's a greater margin for error and room to compensate for mistakes or mismatched skill levels. This tolerance is something the current 4-player design lacks, as it demands near-perfect performance, which feels at odds with Fallout 76's usual gameplay philosophy.  


I guess nerfing various aspects such as the amount of health or allowing for revives would maybe help make 4 player teams more fun but ultimately just keeping everything as it is and allowing 2 teams to join one instance works great.

Hydration: The Key Role of Water in Your Daily Nutrition
--------------------------------------------------------

Water is often overshadowed by solid foods in the discussion of nutrition, yet it plays an essential role in maintaining overall health and well-being. When you think about hydration, consider that the human body is composed of around 60% water. This powerful liquid is not just a thirst quencher; it‚Äôs a vital nutrient that influences numerous functions within the body. Understanding how water affects your daily nutrition is the first step toward harnessing its full potential.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Staying well-hydrated has considerable benefits for both mental and physical health. Here are some key functions of water:

- **Temperature Regulation:** Water helps to maintain your body temperature. Sweating is one way the body cools itself, and when you are adequately hydrated, this process works effectively.
- **Transporting Nutrients:** Water is a crucial component in transporting nutrients and oxygen to cells. Without sufficient hydration, nutrient absorption and delivery become hindered.
- **Joint Lubrication:** Water plays a significant role in keeping joints lubricated and functioning smoothly. A well-hydrated body can reduce the risk of joint discomfort.
- **Digestive Health:** Proper hydration helps in digestion and allows for the efficient breakdown of food. It aids in preventing constipation by ensuring that the digestive system operates smoothly.
- **Detoxification:** Water is essential for the kidneys to filter waste products from the blood. Staying hydrated ensures effective filtration and waste removal.

A water-based diet plan into your daily routine can elevate these benefits even further. Here are some easy strategies to stay hydrated:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Start Your Day Right:** Begin your morning with a glass of water. This helps kickstart your metabolism and hydrates your body post-sleep.
- **Infuse Your Water:** Add fruits, herbs, or vegetables to your water for flavor. Cucumber, lemon, and mint are popular choices that not only taste good but also add some vitamins.
- **Set Reminders:** Use technology to your advantage. Set reminders on your phone to drink water at intervals throughout the day.
- **Eat Water-Rich Foods:** Many fruits and vegetables have high water content. Include options like watermelon, cucumbers, oranges, and lettuce in your meals.
- **Limit Diuretics:** Drinks like coffee and alcohol can lead to dehydration. Try to moderate your intake and balance these with extra water.

Understanding your body's hydration needs can also help you adjust your water intake based on activity level and environmental factors. Engaging in physical activity increases fluid loss through sweat, so additional hydration is necessary. In warmer climates, your body will require more water to maintain balance.

Monitoring your hydration status is simple! Check the color of your urine; a light yellow indicates proper hydration while dark yellow suggests increased fluid needs. If you feel thirsty, it's already a sign that your body is asking for more water!

By simply being aware of how much water you consume and making small changes, you will likely notice improvements in energy levels, mood, and overall health.

Ultimately, the importance of water can't be overstated in daily nutrition. It‚Äôs an integral part of staying healthy, serving various key functions that aid in sustaining life. By prioritizing hydration, you not only benefit yourself but also empower your body to perform at its best.

Common Misconceptions About Water Based Diets and Their Effectiveness
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to nutrition trends, water-based diets often generate a lot of buzz, yet many individuals hold misunderstandings about their effectiveness. Let's explore some of these common misconceptions to help you better understand what a water-based diet plan entails and how it can truly benefit you.

### Misconception #1: Water-Based Diets Are Only About Drinking Water

One of the biggest misconceptions surrounding water-based diets is that they focus solely on drinking large quantities of water. While hydration is a crucial aspect, these diets often emphasize incorporating a variety of water-rich foods as well. Foods like fruits, vegetables, and soups not only help hydrate your body but also provide essential vitamins and minerals. So, a water-based diet is not just about gulping down water; it‚Äôs about creating a balanced meal plan that includes hydrating foods.

### Misconception #2: You Will Be Hungry All the Time

**Many fear that a water-based diet will leave them perpetually hungry.** However, this is not the case when the diet includes a variety of water-rich foods. Foods such as cucumbers, watermelon, and oranges are high in water content and low in calories. These can help you feel full without consuming excess calories. Eating a mix of these foods can satiate your hunger while keeping you hydrated and nourished.

### Misconception #3: Water-Based Diets Are Only Temporary

Some people associate water-based diets with quick fixes that aren‚Äôt sustainable in the long run. While short-term water-based diets can lead to temporary weight loss, a well-planned water-based diet can be a permanent lifestyle change. By consistently choosing foods with high water content and maintaining hydration, you can establish healthier eating habits that contribute to long-term weight management.

### Misconception #4: They Are Not Nutritionally Balanced

Error leads many to think that a water-based diet lacks essential nutrients. This is a misconception. A properly structured water-based diet is rich in nutrients. For instance, including foods like leafy greens, bell peppers, and legumes not only hydrates but also provides protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. To create a balanced diet, aim for a plate that has:

- **Fruits:** Strawberries, peaches, cherries
- **Vegetables:** Spinach, lettuce, celery
- **Whole Grains:** Oats, quinoa, brown rice
- **Healthy Fats:** Avocado, chia seeds, nuts

### Misconception #5: Water-Based Diets Are Too Expensive

Many believe that following a water-based diet can break the bank, but this isn't true. seasonal fruits and vegetables that have high water content can actually save you money. Buying in bulk or choosing local produce can be economical. Furthermore, preparing meals at home with affordable ingredients can be cheaper than dining out or buying processed foods.

### Misconception #6: They Don‚Äôt Promote Weight Loss

While some think a water-based diet is ineffective for weight loss, studies indicate otherwise. When you consume foods that are low in calories but high in volume, like soups and salads, you can eat satisfying portions without exceeding your caloric intake. This can lead to gradual weight loss. Adding physical activity will enhance these effects and overall health.

### Misconception #7: You Can‚Äôt Eat Solid Foods

Another myth is that a water-based diet involves only liquids. This isn‚Äôt the case at all. You can enjoy solid foods that are rich in water content, such as fruits and vegetables. These solid foods help in maintaining a balanced diet while keeping your hydration levels up. You can create delicious meals incorporating water-rich items, making your diet both enjoyable and effective.

Was thinking it'd be nice to consider something like the¬†**Sea to Sky Gondola or taking a trip to Whistler**, but it might be a bit too late to book something around those dates at a good price, so always like to hear any other hidden gems.

Would love to hear if anybody knows of¬†**any specific event that would be nice to see with the kid**¬†and the grandparents around those dates! I don't have many friends with kids, so sometimes I don't hear of specific events that could be good to check out. Also if there's any **cool playgrounds** that we could take him on a more chill walk day while we all have coffee or hot chocolate from a nearby coffee shop.

I've also been wondering if I should¬†**consider renting a vehicle**, I usually use evos in the city, and thought we could do that plus uber around, but if anyone has any tips about vehicle renting I'd appreciate any good options! Although to be honest, I usually avoid driving whenever it snows heavily in the area, so that might influence this option if we're getting a white new year.

Anyways, thanks again if you read up so far to here. Wishing you all some good holidays and all that!

1h74naw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/1h74naw/touchpad_effect_with_a_3hwpp_battery_swollen/,Touchpad effect with a 3HWPP battery swollen,"A few weeks ago, my DELL LATITUDE 5401 started to have strange behaviors : random click, cursor move without interaction. It happens even in the BIOS, so I suspected a hardware issue. When cover was closed and I put my coffee mug on top of it, it trigger a right click.

Opening the laptop revealed the battery was swollen. It was the original one, delivered with the laptop (build probably in 2019 , I bought it used). Main usage was to have the laptop always connected with the power cord.

So I order a new battery replacement from DELL site (ref 3HWPP), for a pretty good price in december with promo code (63‚Ç¨), received it in less than a week. Easy to install, you have to reuse the little internal power cord from the old battery.

The old swollen battery start to fall a part. The metal case reveal 4 internal battery cells (ref LGA575B1), two of them was swollen as you can see on the picture. It was so swollen (maybe 2mm more than the new batt) that it contact at some point the touchpad from the inside.

With the new batt, everything is back to normal.

1h74j5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/tooyoungtobethissick/comments/1h74j5g/just_kind_of_tired_of_being_too_sick_but_also_not/,"Just kind of tired of being too sick, but also not being ""sick enough""","I am sick duh that's why I am here, but I feel like I'm not ""sick enough"" at the same time. I hope that I can convey what I feel because I do feel so lost at the moment. Please tell me I'm not the only one, and someone gets me.

I didn't wake up one morning thinking ""Oh, this is not how I usually feel, I'm definitely sick in some way"", it was a gradual process. From feeling a bit meh now and then to feeling meh every day. From feeling ""not my peak performance"" during workouts and ""a bit under the weather"" to ""well, I guess I can't do any of the things I used to... damn, I may be disabled and chronically sick.""

The process was so gradual that I don't even really know when the symptoms started. Being the one in  the situation, I didn't notice anything was that off. It was people around me who noticed the change and encouraged me to ask for help. I brushed off things like blacking out and collapsing regularly, eating very little (one salad and a cup of coffee per day, everyday) and still gaining weight like crazy, being unable to walk my dog, or gasping for air going up a hill.

Even now, my biggest struggle is that I don't have a big rash or a bleeding wound. I dont have this thing where i can say ""Look at this, LOOK its real""  
No i ""just"" have this permanent exhaustion, migraines, muscle fatigue, and worsening arm pain. Even my labs ""only"" show high inflammatory markers, slightly abnormal hormones and sporadically ,  low blood sugar, and low blood pressure.   
  
Doctors dont go ""Wow you got this dangerous arythmia lets figure this out asap"" its more like ""well you aint dying, and we dont know whats wrong with you so...just carry on i guess?""

I think people with a diagnosis can look back and see the clues. I cant do that since i have no diagnosis. What i have is self-doubt and self-gaslighting, in addition to gaslighting from doctors. 

Unlike what doctors seem to think, I didn't just decide one day to make up symptoms to waste time at doctors offices.Many times doctors said ""it's just stress!"" and I thought, ""thank god, I can fix that!""  
In fact, when people suggested hypothyroidism, I was anxious about lifelong medication. Now, 10 years later, I WISH I just had this one easy to treat condition and would finally know whats wrong.

It wasn't until I saw a Twitter post about being chronically sick that it clicked. I said ""i am not chronically sick but ...."" and so many people said ""well sorry to tell you but you **are**"". And it blew my mind because I guess I am? No doctor took me seriously, and I just got worse bit by bit. I knew I was unwell, but it felt like a temporary state. Just cutting out pieces of my life one by one, to function, to survive. It wasn't until this year I realized that I'm 30, where did my life go? Can I ever return to my old hobbies? Will i ever be healthy again?   
  
Like wait hold up, thats super scary!  
What do you mean i cant just be a happy healthy 20year old living my life to the fullest?!

People (including doctors) now say, ""well, you aren't the youngest. Maybe you're just getting old?""   
Thanks more gaslighting. As if the ""i think you re just fat and thats why you re in pain"" thing. 

I still hope for a diagnosis and treatment. I need to hope or i ll go insane but... so many doctors have given up on me and many tests came back ""normal"".  
I am tired of trying and fighting. I'm tired of trying to figure out what's wrong and arguing with doctors. I shouldnt be the one on pubmed researching shit, only to be blocked by a doctor who says  "" why should a ""healthy"" 30-year-old need more tests.""  
  
So yeah i have these re-occuring thoughts like ....  
  
""Well maybe i am just old. Maybe i am just fat. Maybe i am just lazy. Maybe i simply aint trying hard enough. Maybe it is the worlds weirdest new type of depression, where my mind is full of energy and joy and enthusiasm, but my body doesnt want me to do anything""

Its exhausting. I dont know how to prove to myself that i am truly sick on days where its truly hard to keep fighting and advocating. I am still, i will continue to. But the list of ideas i have is down to 3 tests.

1h74hhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1h74hhw/how_to_choose_furniture_that_complements_your/,How to Choose Furniture That Complements Your Interior Design Style,"Furnishing your home isn‚Äôt just about practicality; it‚Äôs about creating a space that reflects your personality and enhances your lifestyle. The key to achieving this lies in choosing furniture that complements your interior design style. Whether you‚Äôre drawn to minimalist modern aesthetics, timeless traditional charm, or eclectic bohemian vibes, here‚Äôs how to select pieces that fit seamlessly into your home.

# 1. Define Your Style

The first step to choosing furniture that complements your space is understanding your interior design style.

* **Modern Minimalism:** Look for sleek lines, neutral tones, and functional pieces like a [large coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/henri-coffee-table-large) with clean edges.
* **Bohemian Bliss:** Opt for textured accents such as a patterned [pouf](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs) to add depth and interest.
* **Traditional Elegance:** Embrace timeless furniture like a tufted [armchair Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/armchairs) shoppers adore for its classic appeal.

Knowing your style helps narrow down your choices and ensures harmony in your decor.

# 2. Start with Anchor Pieces

Anchor pieces, such as your sofa, dining table, or **large coffee table**, set the tone for your space. Select high-quality items that embody your chosen aesthetic.

* For living rooms, a **pouf** or a collection of [poufs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs) can serve as versatile seating or a casual statement piece.
* A bold **armchair Dubai** residents love can double as a stylish focal point and a cozy reading nook.

Choose colors, materials, and designs that tie in with the rest of your decor for a cohesive look.

# 3. Balance Functionality and Style

Furniture should not only look good but also serve your needs.

* For smaller spaces, multifunctional items like poufs can act as extra seating, footrests, or even side tables.
* A **large coffee table** with storage options can help keep clutter at bay while adding to the room's style.
* In bedrooms, consider compact armchairs that blend luxury and comfort without overwhelming the space.

# 4. Focus on Proportions and Scale

No matter your interior design style, the size of your furniture matters.

* In compact living rooms, pair a slim **armchair Dubai** with smaller **poufs for living room** seating to create a balanced layout.
* For larger spaces, a grand **large coffee table** can anchor the room and provide ample surface area for decorative elements.

Always measure your space to ensure each piece fits comfortably without overcrowding the room.

# 5. Mix Textures and Materials

Mixing materials and textures adds visual interest and depth to your interiors.

* A leather **armchair Dubai** perfectly complements a textured fabric pouf or woven rug.
* Wooden or marble coffee tables can contrast beautifully with soft furnishings for a harmonious yet dynamic look.
* For a cozy bohemian touch, pair a vibrant patterned **pouf** with neutral-toned sofas or armchairs.

# 6. Consider Color Coordination

Color plays a significant role in unifying your interior design.

* Neutral furniture like beige or gray sofas and armchairs allows for flexibility in adding bold accents, such as a bright **pouf** or throw pillows.
* Use a statement **large coffee table** in natural wood or metallic finishes to tie together other elements in the room.
* Experiment with complementary hues across accessories, furniture, and decor for a polished result.

# 7. Prioritize Quality and Longevity

Investing in durable, high-quality furniture ensures that your pieces stand the test of time.

* Opt for poufs and armchairs made from premium materials that combine comfort with lasting durability.
* A **large coffee table** crafted from solid wood or marble can withstand daily use while elevating your space.

# Final Thoughts

Choosing furniture that complements your interior design style is about finding the perfect balance between aesthetics, functionality, and personal taste. Incorporate versatile pieces like a cozy **pouf**, a stunning **large coffee table**, or a luxurious **armchair Dubai** loves for both its style and comfort. With thoughtful choices, you can create a home that feels cohesive, inviting, and uniquely yours.
