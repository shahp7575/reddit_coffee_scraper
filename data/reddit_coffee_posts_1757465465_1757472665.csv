1nd2tf9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nd2tf9,Full circle,"Photos in Reverse chronological order. My hair’s back after a daunting journey. I consider myself incredibly lucky to be where I am today. 

It started off in May with a patch of hair missing on the right of my head, about the size of a golf ball. I buzzed my hair almost immediately after I noticed, and it just kept getting worse. I was devastated, and incredibly stressed. I remember shaving my head bald for the first time, crying while I ran the razor across my scalp. 

The first few weeks were hard, I hid indoors and felt ashamed everytime I walked outside. Going to school was tough, I hid from the sun all summer. Finally I went to the hospital for blood work, and a referral to the dermatologist. 

At the time I was smoking a lot of weed and tobacco (poppers for those who are familiar with the term) and barely eating. My stress levels were constantly high.

I smashed my bong, and started trying to reduce how much I smoked. I starting drinking kombucha in hopes that it would help my gut recover from the constant fast food, coffee, and cigarette smoking that was making my stomach ache. 

The shedding continued getting worse, I was resigned to the fact that this was how life was going to be and did all I could to accept it, focusing on the positive traits of my personality and character and trying not to think about my looks. 

Still, there were habits that made my stomach sink, like going to run my hand through my hair, shaking the water out of my hair after a shower, feeling the wind in my hair. Each one of these was a subconscious habit that reminded me of the trouble I was going through. 

Each time I shaved my head, I would pray it would maybe grow back, but the smooth spots kept expanding until I had about 50% of my hair left.

I kept reducing how much I smoked, kept trying to transform my habits, kept applying for jobs and pushing to live life normally. I cleaned my room and washed bed sheets I’d been neglecting out of depression and kept pushing forward. I cut gluten out of my diet in case that might be the cause.

When I went to see the dermatologist, they said it could be a thyroid issue, and to get blood work done (I still haven’t) and recommended different treatments (fin/min) and jam inhibitors should the lesser options fail.

Resigned to the fact that I’d be dependant on medication to maintain my hair, I declined the treatment, to which the doctor said “hey, it’s your hair..” (which is a fair reaction)

I kept going about my life, trying to get out in the sun to get my vitamin D up, staying active and trying to eat better. I started to see faint regrowth starting where my hair first fell out, despite the fact that my hair was still shedding. Still, found myself deeply depressed, and decided to start self medicating with magic mushrooms. 

I dosed every night for 5 days straight, I don’t know why I chose to do this, maybe to try and reset my brain subconsciously after reading about the rewiring effects it has on the brain. It was 5 days of hellish anxiety and bad trips, but I kept hammering away at the bag until they ran out. 

After that, I quit smoking weed entirely (14 days sober so far) and quit smoking cigarettes but kept vaping. 

The regrowth continued, and I kept eating better, focusing on hormone stabilizing foods and adequate sleep. It’s been three weeks since those trips, and my hair is almost completely back, still thinner where it once was bald, but growing back stronger than I ever imagined it could. 

It made me wonder about the immune regulating properties of mushrooms, but I believe the regrowth happened before then, and it’s just coincidence. 

Now, there’s just a grey patch where the first hair loss occurred. I’m using rosemary oil, enjoying my meal prep, and looking forward to being able to get a haircut again one day. The whole process was a mindfuck, so to anyone going through it, I hope my story can help in some way. Stay healthy, and hold onto hope.

# Caffeine Content In Mcdonald’s Iced Coffee

McDonald’s iced coffee is a popular choice for a quick caffeine boost. Many wonder how much caffeine is inside each cup. Knowing the caffeine content helps you manage your daily intake. It also helps you choose the right size for your needs.

# Small

The small iced coffee at McDonald’s contains about 90 milligrams of caffeine. This size is perfect for light caffeine drinkers. It gives a gentle energy lift without feeling too strong. Many enjoy this size as a morning starter.

# Medium

The medium size has approximately 150 milligrams of caffeine. It offers a stronger kick than the small. This amount suits people who need more energy during the day. It balances flavor and caffeine well for most customers.

# Large

The large McDonald’s iced coffee contains around 180 milligrams of caffeine. This size delivers the biggest caffeine punch. Ideal for those needing extra alertness or a long-lasting boost. Keep in mind, too much caffeine may cause jitters.

# Comparison With Other Coffee Drinks

Energy drinks can exceed 200 milligrams in one serving. McDonald’s iced coffee fits well between regular coffee and stronger drinks.

# Factors Influencing Caffeine Levels

Would giving it to her be too much?","I’m a freshman and not the kind of person who usually talks to strangers. But I saw this girl painting alone by a lake on campus. She looked peaceful, totally in her own world. I surprised myself and talked to her. Just a short exchange, but it felt meaningful. I went away to get some coffee for her but when I came back, she was gone. My fault though; should’ve told her that I was going to grab coffee and would be back soon.

Anyway, later I emailed a bunch of people with her name until one replied and confirmed it was her. I told her I’d love to give her the iced coffee I bought that day, and she replied with:

“That’s so nice of you, you didn’t have to get me anything! I really appreciate the compliments on my rusty painting skills too haha.
I’d be down for a friendly hang out sometime when my schedule clears up a bit cause unfortunately, I’ve been bombarded with assignments and I’m going to see my partner this weekend, but possibly next week if you were still interested!”

So yeah turns out that she’s in a relationship. But she was warm, respectful, and left the door open for a casual hangout.

I haven’t painted anything yet, but I’m thinking of painting the moment I saw her (not her face, just the scene of her painting by the lake). I’d give it to her when I meet her for coffee.

Would that be sweet or too much?

Thank you everyone for your input. I’m not really a social person so I guess I’m overthinking a lot.

TL;DR: Saw a girl on campus, went to grab coffee for her but she was gone. Later emailed her and asked to meet up. Would it be ok to give her a painting?

Did you seriously believe that everything would follow the script. We would have a peaceful prostest, the government would resign and we would all go home eat our daal bhat and sleep. Did you think all the parties with ulterior motives would stay on the side, clap their hands and praise you. Politics is a dirty game, its all about changing the narrative to suit your interests using opportunities to further your goals and backstabbing your oppositions and friends. 

Take a moment to think. Do you think if everybody peacefully protested, shouted our slogans and held our banners on street corners the government would have resigned?? Things got out of hand, some elements used the opportunity to bring destruction and chaos to further their goals. Do not blame yourself for it. Your heart is pure and you stepped into the field with an idealistic dream and love for your country. 

Things got out of hand would be the understatement of the year. Destruction to public properties, loss of lives that will take us years to recover. 

But before you lament, congragulate yourself. You have done something, bigger and more powerful countries have failed to do. You toppled a corrupt government in 28 hours. I am still filled with awe to see the strength of the youth, the unity to stand without fear in front of unsurmountable odds. Your courage to stand and speak for your rights is an inspiration to everyone here and abroad. It tells me the younger generation has their heart in the right place and the country does have a better future. 

As i sip my coffee this morning, iam filled with uncertainty and fear of the question, what now ??
The next few days is whats going to shape the future of the country. Do not let others hijack your narrative. The battle has been fought and but not the war. Do not let everything you have done go to waste. Unite, ask, demand for what you have stood for. Stay strong, stay brave. Do not let others enjoy the fruits of your labor.

I don't really know why I'm making this post, but I just want to say it's a great game and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not encounter any bugs that hindered my gameplay or where visually immersion breaking. The only thing negative that I have to say from the playthrough isn't really negative and I in fact expected it. I would drop frames at times when I had all of my machinery (which was centrally located at one spot on that map for the most part) running in late game or when I went to place a large blueprint that I had devised. Again I expected this and It caused me zero trouble.

The game does a great job of not bogging you down with exploration and survival, which was a fear I had going in, and makes it to where you only really need to explore if you want too. The focus was on the mission and your ability to create an efficient factory, it's simple and concise design and I really like that game philosophy here. They could have easily made a food and water system and I'm glad they didn't do it.

I'm also surprised that only 4.6% of players have beaten the game on steam, makes me feel pretty good. (NOTE THIS IS SINCE 1.0 RELEASE ADDED ACHIEVEMENTS - u/Ricky_Ventura)

The game was never overly complicated which was also refreshing. The stages of the space elevator phases added just enough new content to not overwhelm me and also just enough of a reward in new tech to make it feel rewarding.

I also am particularly proud of my factory design philosophy of triple verticality. I have no idea if it is unoriginal or not, but I figured with there being three outputs on splitters that most machines could be build in three stacks on top of each other, linked by a splitter and conveyor lifts and subsequently by a merger into a storage. This allowed for triple production of a resource or item with only one line in and out. I included plenty of examples in the screenshots above. I made this same design for every machine type except for manufacturers (which I did the triple system still but did them horizontally since 4 input machines stacked would get very messy) and large machines like particle accelerator and such.

I also want to commend the game for having a concise ending. I feel like so many games I play these days just seem to drag on through live service models or New Game plus mechanics. This game simply ends when you are done and it just feels... well.... SATISFYING :)

Monkey Duo: Yue Xing and Heiyue
Alias/Nicknames: CoffeeCake, Sunflower
Name: Yue Xing
Occupation: Baker/Server
Weapon: Three Section Staff
Powers: Cloning, Transformation, super Strength, Basically Wukong but not as strong.
Having grown up in the serene, magical halls of the Celestial Palace, Yue Xing is naturally graceful and polite, but Earth life has brought out his curiosity, adaptability, and streak of playful mischief. He has a small bit of disdain for the father he's never met, but hides it under a cheerful, sometimes cheeky demeanor. He struggles a bit with earthly social norms and slang, which can lead to charming misunderstandings... or well-placed sass.
Notable Quirks:
Still uses Moon Palace etiquette in casual settings (bows to shop customers, addresses friends like nobles). Keeps a hidden journal of everything he remembers about the Moon and notes on rumors about Sun Wukong.
——————————-
Alias: Lunar Monkey, Moonflower, Little Shadow Name: Heiyue
Occupation: Pastry Chef
Weapon: Guandao
Powers: Shadow manipulation, Shadow Step, Shadow Clones, Lunar Endurance, Enhanced Agility and Stealth Grounded, observant, and a little sharper-tongued than his brother, Heiyue has a knack for reading people quickly - a trait clearly inherited from Macaque. He has an easy bond with his father and often trains with him, giving him confidence in his abilities. However, his closeness with Macaque sometimes makes him overly protective of Yue Xing, especially when he sees how much the absent Wukong still affects his half-brother.
While more pragmatic than Yue Xing, he shares his sense of humor and will join in on harmless pranks (and sometimes escalate them).
Notable Quirks:
Has a habit of appearing silently right behind people mid-conversation. Collects small, polished stones from places he visits and keeps them in a box under his bed. Often acts as Yue Xing's ""translator"" when his brother's moon-born habits confuse Earth locals.",1,1757471312.0,MonkieKid,0,1.0,False

1nd29qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nd29qa/my_husband_is_actively_choosing_his_dreams_over/,My husband is actively choosing his dreams over our relationship and I'm at my breaking point,"I (28F) have been married for 4 years to my husband (26M) and over the last year and a half he has become incredibly selfish with his spending and chosen funding his dream career (art related) over our relationship time and time again, leaving us without food, a working vehicle, and now no rainy day fund or nest egg. This post covers incredibly personal material and because of that I wanted to post anonymously but honestly - at this point there's nothing I'm going to say here that I haven't already discussed with him in person and we've gotten nowhere. TLDR at bottom. I will be the first to say that I'm not perfect. I'm not a perfect person, or a perfect spouse, I can be lazy at times, I have a tendency to get upset tans keep it to myself but I'm trying hard to changes that actively, I struggle with depression and anxiety and self-harm tendencies, I withdraw at times but I still try to be communicative as to what's going on - I try every day that my eyes open to be the best I can be for him and everyone around me and I'm tired of feeling lucky to be loved. Tired of accepting what I'm now realizing isn't even the bare minimum because I'm blinded by a future that I can't see anymore with a person I feel like I don't even know. I'm so torn and upset because this is a good human being, a sweet, kind, caring and loving man and I want more than anything else in this world for that to be enough. I can feel myself closing in, feel the walls going up, feel myself falling out of love and it's terrifying and I don't know how to fix it. 

Not any one thing led to this point, it's a collection of things big and small and I think part of the reason it's eating me up so bad is because I've tried so hard. I've done my best to grow as a person and step outside of my comfort zone and be communicative, I've initiated talks and discussions over these issues, even made tangible goals to hit to make sure things would actually change, and still nothing *has* changed. I have legitimately told him to his face that we no longer feel like a relationship but like roommates, and bad ones at that, because I support our household and him almost completely on my own, even though it means that I often go without. He has to be to work earlier than me, but I normally wake up first, I handle the househoId morning routine, walking our dogs, scooping the litterbox, watering the plants, taking out trash, if our SCHEDULED pest control is coming I'm normally the one that deep cleans the house, and wrangles all of the animals but recently I have been demanding help with that - all while making my coffee, and getting ready for work, meanwhile he gets up and ready and out the door in 10-15 minutes and is gone. I've asked for help in the mornings and he will help for a few weeks and then it goes back to normal. I work a full-time physically demanding job 36-40ish hours a week, run my own business out of our home on top of that and have at least 2 side hustles going at any time. He has a part-time job at a fast food restaurant where he gets free meals and 2 side hustles working in the art industry and all 3 of those added together make less than my main job. He's supposed to be in charge of buying groceries but he doesn't buy groceries for *us* he buys groceries for *dinner* and snacks which means that any meal outside of that I must provide for myself - which is fine, I'm an adult and can feed myself, or at least it would be if I had any money left over after paying our bills to buy food for myself.

There are many days that I get home and I am too tired and too drained to cook and he does end up cooking most nights but it doesn't happen until 10pm or later and sometimes we end up just going to sleep - even with help and me asking to eat earlier - so most day I don't eat all day until 11/11:45 pm. I used to order delivery a lot because my life is super busy and I didn't have the ability drive and go get myself food at work due to our family not having a working vehicle and that got expensive very quickly - I'd rather pay rent and have a roof over everyone's head instead of eating at that point. I work too much to not be fueling my body properly like that and my body is literally starting to fall apart at the seems. I've expressed this to him and he has even cried, expressing guilt that he cannot provide the life he says I deserve. 

It isn't about not having money or not providing - it's about sticking together and being there for one another. I don't care if we're dirt poor and struggling but we said we'd struggle together and instead I'm the only one. His car broke down shortly after we moved in together and my car had been struggling for awhile but I was doing my best to keep it running. I was trying to save up for a down payment on a good, newer car because I've only ever had rust buckets and lemons. I had a solid amount of money saved up, but then one thing after another, and suddenly it was all gone. We had an emergency with one of our dogs, it had an obstruction and needed surgery - i put in almost $1k of my own money. We had to take out a loan and that's when I found out how much debt he's been hiding from me. I never lied to him or hid my college debt - it's a crazy amount and I'll probably never finish paying it off. My concern is that at this point he'd taken a step back from his main job a little to focus on his dream career and we could afford it at this point and I wanted to give him support since he didn't have mich growing up - it was only for a season and that was fine - but that means he had extra funds. He no longer had to pay for things like the Internet, or even groceries that much at that point, I even pay our phone bill. With the new loan, his debt was at $15k, the vet bill only being $5k of that, and he had left over credit that WE ended up not using. I say we because HE used it. What on? I don't know. Because at this point I'd said he didn't have to pay me rent anymore because his half of the rent would be almost equal to my half of the loan payment so why not just keep the rent money and use it to pay the loan? At this point he was back to working more hours. Well - turns out, he wasn't making payments on the loan. Where that extra $600 a month was going - I have no clue. Then he begins to recede from me. Becomes more active in his art community. Stops inviting me to exhibits and cons. I begin to feel resentful and I tell him as much. He says that he didn't realize he could invite his spouse to events, even though everyone else does, and that he didn't want to impose. I buy tickets to an exhibit, and dress really nice and plan on taking him out to dinner afterwards because I know he's nervous and wants it to be a success and no one ever celebrates him. I get there and he leaves me to go out to dinner with his friends, which is fine, it was a huge success and everyone wanted to celebrate, it was the first time people had come together for jim.like this and I loved it - I was even dressed for the occasion, but he LEFT me there, in the city at night alone, waiting for an uber (I had assumed we'd go somewhere fancy and drink and maybe even hit a club so I didn't drive)- even his friends were inviting me and I had to invite myself and he still said no... It didn't sit right with me... I asked him politely to wait on me for my Uber because I was dressed to the nines in the dead of night and didn't want to be alone and he once again said no, that his friends were carpooling so he needed to leave right then.... I told him I could have bought him and Uber and he said he didn't want me to waste my money when it wasn't necessary. That night I sent him a long message about how I love him, but he's hurt my feelings and all I wanted to do was be there for him. I know I should've waited until he was home to have the conversation but I also knew he'd be drunk when he got home and hungover the next day and that if I didn't say something in the moment I was going to internalize it and keep it to myself and let it fester if I had to wait for two days to talk about it. He apparently got hammered and made an ass out of himself that night, stumbling into the house drunk, talking about how everyone was saying he was plastered but he's sober, slurring his words while at it. I just went to bed. In the morning I told him that I was sorry he was being picked on and that I wish that I had been there so I could've had his back and only then did he apologize for everything. Everything was strained after that, and I noticed he stopped wanting even the intimacy of sitting next to each other on the couch and all  conversation that wasn't necessary stopped. 

A few weeks later he asked about opening up the relationship and my heart sank. I'd told him that I was interested in ENM from the beginning, but only after our relationship was as strong and healthy as it could be. After many in depth conversations and lots of education - he has very little experience and only one true relationship before we got together - he says that you know what, he thinks ENM might actually be a nice idea eventually. I get hit on a lot and it was pretty obvious from the beginning that it was an issue for him, and after one night in particular he told me that he didn't think he'd be okay with any kind of poly or ENM activity in our relationship for the foreseeable future and I was blindsided but I understood. So when he brings up opening the relationship I ask him why the sudden change, and I think he must have known he couldn't hide it from me because he was honest and told me that he liked someone else. I was devastated. I don't care about the crush - I care about the manipulative, opportunistic behavior. I care about the fact that opening the relationship should've been a conclusion we came to together. I care about the fact that instead of this being about *us* and the strength and happiness of our relationship is was because he fell for someone else. I obviously said no and told him why, and expressed that him coming to such an immature conclusion shows me that he may never be ready for us to open the relationship if this is what he thinks it's about.

After that, my trust was shattered. I was no longer attracted to him. In my eyes, you spend most of your time with someone, you cut out your partner from your personal life and replace them with that someone, stop working your main job so you can spend more time around this someone, and then go as far as to try to include them into your relationship - that's cheating. That's having a wandering eye. That's not just a crush... I've brought this up more times than I can count and nothing has come of it, it's like he doesn't understand that we don't get to just talk about it and move on, that the trust needs to be built back up.... That was over a year ago. I can count on my hands the amount of times he initiated physical contact before this, it was almost always me and I get it, he was nervous to make a move and had little experience but I felt so unwanted... Now I don't even want him to touch me at all and it feels like he's all over me. 

Then my car broke down and after all this time he's been apparently still not paying his debt or our bills or saving money. I panicked because not having a car affects every aspect of my life, especially my business. We get the car running after a lot of time and money and then he tells me he wants to make his own exhibit. That right off the bat it'll cost him $1000. I was stunned, wondering why he would even tell me since we obviously can't afford it and then he tells me that he CAN afford it if he makes spending changes. The changes? All of the things I've asked him to do so he can afford to help out more at the house. He won't even get a joint bank account with me because he said he's ""scared"" and it feels ""kinda controlling"". He doesn't have $1k when WE need it, when our ANIMALS need it, when we don't have a working vehicle, when we desperately need a new car, when there are days I don't eat so I can afford to pick up food for our pets - half of which are his that he wanted because he's never been allowed to have pets before - that I almost fully support, including food, vet bills, cleaning supplies, litter. If I'm on my way home and I know he's been at home all day and I know we don't have any food at home I won't stop and get food without him, I wait until I get home and ask him or call to ask if he wants something, when half the time I get home and he's already ordered food for himself knowing I was on my way home and that I hadn't eaten yet.

It just feels like he doesn't think or care about me at all anymore, I've asked him not to (even though it broke my heart and I felt liek a piece of shit for suggesting it) and he's continuing with his art showing, and when my car broke down dead dead he knew I was at my wits end and instead of calling it off to save the other $2k he's now sunk into the showing and getting a second job he called his mom sobbing, saying I was going to leave him and she started giving him money that our household *still* didn't see, then got us a car which is - wow, completely amazing and a huge favor, only for me to find out it's because he called her crying, and that now we owe her $7k because she took out a loan to get us the car because now both of our credits are destroyed and we can't get a loan for a down payment... I didn't know OR agree to this and I was shocked when I found out. I knew that it was odd that she got us a car, but I thought she was just helping her son out, not that she's in debt now and thinks it's because of me and my lack of loyalty to her son! She looks at me different now and I didn't understand until his older sister let it slip that their mother had taken out a loan. He had left over money after we got the car apparently and was supposed to use it to get his half dead car fixed and didn't, don't know where that money went. All I'm asking for us transparency and honesty and I'm not getting it. He still asks me to send him money for Uber or for food delivery, or most recently to get the tags for his car renewed because he's been driving the poor thing on its last leg with tags that are nearly a year out of date. I bought the tags for the new car, that didn't come out of the loan money. I'm so lost. I feel like I'm suffocating. I feel like I'm trapped in a box that keeps getting hotter and smaller and I want to sob and scream and run away and I don't know what to do. I don't know if this can even be rebuilt, restarted, even from the ground up. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, what I'm not saying right because I feel like any normal person would be devastated to hear their wife tell them that they aren't attracted to them anymore, that the relationship feels more like roommates, that they don't trust them, that they need more from them -  the same amount of dedication that is given outside of the home inside of the home and relationship, that if the family loses everything because of their inability to be reliable that she will leave them - yet here he is, chilling without a care in the world... Even had the audacity to tell me that we'd never be homeless because his Mom would let us live with her. I genuinely almost threw up, it gave me the heebie-jeebies. Remaining unreliable because your mother is your safety net is not an option and I told him as much but still... Nothing has changed. I've had a few toxic relationships, I've experienced abuse in the past, and I often feel guilty because he's never done anything like that, never hurt me or pressured me. Genuinely, he is kind. He is sweet. He is a good person. Just a bad husband, at least at the moment. And I'm at a complete and total loss. I know we're young - and above anything I want this to work, but I also don't want to waste both of our time just to have everything end up staying the same and us separate in ten years after being unhappy for too long.

TLDR:
feel like our relationship has become unbalanced in a way that leaves me carrying most of the financial, emotional, and household responsibilities. He can be very sweet and loving, but also cold or withdrawn, and the inconsistency makes it hard for me to feel safe, supported, or attracted. Broken agreements and lack of follow-through have eroded my trust, and I feel like I sacrifice and adjust far more than he does. Living together has actually increased my load instead of easing it, and I need stability, financial partnership, and consistent emotional presence to possibly build anything back again but I'm at a loss at how to get that from him at this point.",5,1757470807.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

back in the spring, my application was solid in most area. gpa was strong, extracurriculars were good, but my original mcat score wasn’t competitive enough for the schools i was aiming for. it was one of those situations where you’re close, but not quite there. at first, i debated just waiting a year to reapply, but deep down i knew that if i gave it one more shot with a better score, i had a chance to make something happen this cycle.

i had about five weeks to prep for this retake, which felt impossible at first. my summer was already packed, and five weeks for the mcat is… brutal. i had to completely shift my life around. for those five weeks, my world was basically eat, study, sleep, repeat. mornings were for heavy content review, afternoons for practice questions, and evenings for reviewing every mistake.

resources were pretty standard: uworld and aamc practice exams were my main tools. i did one full-length every weekend, no exceptions, and spent the entire next day breaking it down question by question. i didn’t just glance at explanations, i wrote out in a google doc exactly why i missed each question and the concept behind it. by the end of those five weeks, that doc became my personal “playbook” of weak spots.

one thing that kept me consistent in those long weeks was finding ways to study even outside of my desk time. distractions were my biggest enemy, my phone especially. so i set it up so that whenever i went to open social media, it would hit me with a quick mcat-style question first. it seemed like such a small thing, but over time, those little review questions added up. waiting in line for coffee, sitting on the bus, even just zoning out - suddenly those moments became mini study sessions. it helped me stay locked in without feeling like i was constantly grinding, and i honestly think those small reps helped me recall details on test day (shoutout to the quizscreen app for this, really a game changer).

when scores came back and i saw the 517, i just sat there staring. it was way above what i thought i could pull off with five weeks of prep. and then things moved fast - schools that had been silent for months started reaching out. one of them called me nine days before orientation with an acceptance. i said yes on the spot, and now i’m in a whirlwind of housing, forms, and figuring out how to start this next chapter.

if you’re on the edge about retaking, here’s what i learned: you don’t need a perfect year-long plan. you need focus, quality over quantity, and a way to stay consistent even when motivation dips. those little recall moments on my phone, combined with serious deep dives into practice questions, were what kept me sharp.

nine days ago, i thought my cycle was over. now, i’m about to start med school. it still doesn’t feel real, but it’s proof that one last push can completely change your path.",37,1757470727.0,Mcat,9,0.93,False
1nd28mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1nd28mv/safe_love/,Safe Love,"I want a love that feels warm, cozy, like a little home in the country with the fireplace on. A mug of hot tea or coffee in my lap, a thick blanket around my shoulders.

Where I don't have to earn love or affection, it is freely given because I exist and that is enough. I want a love where I can express my feelings, and they are met with gentleness and understanding. I want someone who listens intently when I speak, because they are genuinely interested in what I have to say. Who is unwavering and almost excessive in their loyalty, not just the appearance of it, but the practice of it. Who is honest to a fault. 

Someone who holds me when I'm upset without trying to fix anything. Who is a person of their word, and shows up when they say they will. Who takes their time getting to know the ins and outs of my soul, who loves me the way *I* want to be loved, and not just in the way that's easiest for them.  Someone who is always taking me into consideration. Who is patient, and gentle, and knows the art of restraint and tact. Who knows reciprocity is important to me, and that there's nothing I ask for I'm not more than willing to give back. Someone who doesn't try to avoid conflict, but sees it as an opportunity to build a new bridge of understanding between each other. Someone who doesn't run. 

I made the mistake of thinking this was you. When I miss you, I am starkly reminded of the fact that I only miss the You from the first few months of our relationship. I was naive and *told* you this is what I was looking for, so of course you did the easy thing: you talked. You said you would love me in all these ways. You're damn good with words too, a real poet. So I fell in love with the promises. Who wouldn't? But in the years that followed, when it came to the actual *practice* of loving me, you were the exact opposite of my safe and cozy love. 

You ran when things were hard, ignored me when I cried, refused to ever reassure me. Got bored and distracted when I'd excitedly tell you a story. You'd lie, for seemingly no reason at all aside from just wanting to and seeing if you could get away with it. You never followed through or stuck to your word. Your heart wandered, though you'd never admit it to me. You didn't consider how your big life decisions would impact me. You punished me for disagreeing with you about anything, even the most trivial of things. Did you love me, or did you love having an NPC girlfriend around?

So please, don't get it twisted. When you see my letters on here, and some of them are about missing you, they're not really about *you.* They're about missing the love I imagined, the love I've dreamed of since I was little. The love that's always been just out of reach. You'd think this would make me desperate, but it just hardens my resolve to not settle for even a drop less. You are not the man I thought you were, and whenever I make a little progress in accepting that difficult fact, I successfully let you go a little bit more.

Which will eventually clear the way for my real Safe Love to come into my life. I want to be ready for him, to be able to give back all I receive and more.

Mottled tin can coffee cups  
Licked and kissed by flames,  
Stinging smoke, rising up  
And whispering our names.

We huddle close around the light,  
Covering it with our frames,  
For who can say that rising smoke  
And Grimm Death aren’t just the same?

The Reaper calls us, one by one,  
He sets out to stake his claims.  
He sows his harvest at our birth,  
He reaps us at our graves.

Every soul that’s lived has died   
And lives again in his domain,  
Wishing how they had listened to  
The smoke and whence he came.

His burning scythe, his flowing robes,  
Black as every mortal shame  
Come rising up through Time’s own hold  
To cut us down in twain.

The only hope that one may have   
To see another day,  
Is in friends and tin can coffee cups,  
And smoke-dampening rain.

1nd22om,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1nd22om/how_can_i_forgive_myself/,How can i forgive myself,"I feel like guilt has crawled into my bones and set up camp. I replay every mistake until it’s the only soundtrack in my head. I lost people I loved—some because I froze, some because I messed up—and now my brain keeps whispering, “See? This is what you deserve.” I don’t have any self-confidence left. I don’t even feel happy being myself. I feel like a bad copy of a person, and everyone can tell.

I wanted connection so badly that I pushed myself past empty, and the stress literally broke me. I ended up in the hospital—bright lights, beeping monitors, IV in my arm—because my body finally said “enough” when I wouldn’t. I lay there feeling small and ridiculous, apologizing to the nurses for taking up space, thinking, How did I let my own mind do this to me?

Now I’m scared of everything. Scared to reach out. Scared to try again. Every conversation feels like a test I’m already failing. I hear rejection in every pause. I say sorry for existing before anyone can be bothered. I miss having “my people” so much it aches, but making new friends feels like walking barefoot over glass: one wrong word and I’m bleeding, and I can’t do another hospital wristband over stress.

I hate that fear is steering my life. I hate how small I’ve made myself just to avoid being hurt. I hate that the past lives rent-free in my head and charges interest. I want to believe I can grow. I want to believe I can make amends and still deserve a seat at the table. I want to believe there’s a version of me who can be honest, be chosen, and not be punished for being human.

Right now I’m just tired—tired of punishing myself, tired of being the villain in my own story, tired of bracing for goodbye before hello even starts. I want to be brave again, even if “brave” is small. One message. One coffee. One moment where I don’t assume the worst. I don’t know how to get there yet… but I’m still here, heart beating, trying.

Lagi ko inaabot expectations nila, Everything I did was for them. I even went to a science highschool so that they didn’t have to worry about my tuition anymore (which was one of the darkest times of my life). Hindi ako palahingi sakanila at ayaw kong ginagastusan nila ako. Pangarap kong maging architect. Nagalit sila sakin when pinagpipilian ko UST and UP, kasi architecture talaga gusto kong course and top school ang UST for it. sabi ko kukuha ako ng scholarship dun, I can do it by myself kasi I always had to. They kept pushing that wala silang pangbayad ng tuition dun. So I chose UP, for them, again. Don’t get me wrong ha, Mahal na Mahal ko UP, pero it was a matter of dream course or dream school. I would choose it agad kahit di ko course basta nasa UPD pero Open University ung natanggap ako, which is para sa mga nagwwork, meaning Nasa dream school ko nga ako pero di ko naman gusto ung course, tapos wala pa akong socialization, nakakulong lang ako sa bahay. Ayaw ko na ulit ng ganun because of the pandemic (I became depressed).

May point sila sa mahal naman talaga tuition sa UST. Well, malaki tampo ko sakanila kasi di nila pinagipunan at nagready para sa college ko. Alam niyo kung bakit? Kasi nagsusugal sila. and im. so. tired. of. it. I hate na sugarol magulang ko. i hate na nangungutang sila sakin para lang may pang sugal sila. i hate na ever since i was a kid di na nila tinigil. i hate that i always had to “understand” them. i hate that i had to grow up early. i hate that i had to be the adult as a child. i hate na alam kong kaya naman namin bumangon at maafford maging stable kahit papano pero nababaon lang kami sa utang dahil sa fcking gambling addiction na yan. masmalaki pa nagastos nila sa pagsusugal kaysa sakin. and it hurts me, it broke me. seeing all of our problems revolve around money and yung pagsusugal nila, IT MAKES IT WORSE.

…

Now I’m an incoming college freshman sa UP Open University. and may coffee shop business kami ng boyfriend ko. It had always been my dream to own a coffee shop (alongside being an architect) and so far napapalago naman namin nang maayos. Very supportive family nya, financially and physically, they treat me as family na nga and kahit wala bf ko i fit in with them na. Every summer during SHS nagwwork kami. Ayaw ako ipagpatuloy ng dad ko dun. Gets ko pa kasi kung yung course ko sa college is puro Google/Zoom Meetings pero masmarami pa ata kaming asynchronous time kaysa sa OLCs. Ayaw ako ipatuloy ng dad ko sa business pag nagpasukan ko na. and it makes me so mad because from my perspective, ung sariling ego niya yung humaharang sakin. They think im mature enough to give them money pang-sugal pero di ko kaya ihandle yung pinasok nila saking school system at pagwwork? I’d rather earn money investing in something na lahat kami makikinabang, with clean money. Mahirap siya pero ano bang silbi ng success kung di lang rin naman paghihirapan? After all that ive been through, sure akong majjuggle ko time ko, and I am capable of doing so. 4x a week lang naman ako magwwork and hindi rin ganun ka-dayo kasi small business lang kami (garage style lang sya with a cart) Most of the time magbabantay lang ako so it’s better to earn money sitting than sit at home. I’m tired of waiting for them to change, Kaya ako na kumikilos para may mangyari samin, is that so wrong? Di ko maintindihan tatay ko.",3,1757470105.0,OffMyChestPH,2,1.0,False

hi there! My name is Brian, i’m 26, newly graduated from my doctorate program in pharmacy. 

There’s a bit about me in my profile, including photos and more about me!

I just finished up some time in michigan, and now i’m back on the west coast, looking to start up my career a bit! I’ve got a big heart and am happy to start taking things a bit slow to see how we start to mesh.

The stink of spoiled meat clings to these concrete walls like a ghost. I breathe it in deep – that sweet rot, the tang of old blood soaked into the floors. My kingdom. My sanctuary. Outside, Berlin screams its filthy songs. Inside, the silence sings \*mine\*. Chains clink softly in the gloom, a promise hanging heavy in the air thicker than the stench. Another canvas awaits. Another pattern of terror to compose.



They call me ‘The Butcher’. A crude name. Simple. They see the scars, the rings carved from knuckle-bone trophies, the mohawk like a battle standard. They see the leather, the spikes, the chains that whisper violence with every step. They don’t \*see\*. Not the Baghdad dust choking a twelve-year-old boy standing over his father’s cooling corpse, the stray bullet a fucking punchline from Allah. Not the hollow ache behind my mother’s eyes as I handed her stolen bread, the shame thicker than the flour dust on my fingers. Five siblings crying in the dark, their bellies gnawing emptiness, \*my\* emptiness reflected in their wide, terrified eyes. Street rat. Thief. Enforcer. The gangs gave me purpose sharper than any blade – inflict pain, receive coin. Feed the hollow ones. Feed the hollow \*me\*. Each broken bone I delivered, each scream I coaxed, was a brick laid in the wall separating Jamal the son, the brother, from the thing I was becoming. The coin silenced the cries at home. It never silenced the cry inside. That cry… it sounded suspiciously like a man’s gasp in the dark alleyways, a trembling hand brushing mine. Filth. Abomination. Punished swiftly, savagely. Yet the gasp echoed. The phantom touch burned. Every blow I landed on those soft, pleading men felt like striking my own reflection.

  
  


Now, Berlin. Freedom tastes like rust and despair. And the hunt… the hunt is everything. Routine is sacred. Dawn finds me sharpening my knives on the whetstone, the rhythmic \*scree-scree-scree\* a prayer to gods long dead. Midday, I stalk the Tiergarten, a predator disguised as just another brute. I watch them. The men who hold hands openly, who kiss beneath the linden trees, who paint their fucking \*love\* on canvases for the world to see. Like that boy. Emil. Skin like moonlight, curls like dark smoke. His gallery… those paintings. Men entwined, bodies glowing with acceptance, with \*joy\*. An obscenity. A provocation. It crawled under my skin, burrowed deep into the rotten core I call a soul. That painting… ‘Embrace’. Two men, foreheads touching, eyes closed in pure, simple fucking peace. It made my teeth ache. Made the hollow places inside scream louder than Emil ever will. He became the ‘antagonist’ in my twisted opera. Not a hero – a symbol. A beacon of the sin I crave and despise. He represented the freedom I could never have, the acceptance I tore out of others with pliers and blades. His art was a direct threat to the fragile, hateful world I’d built brick by bloody brick. He \*had\* to be silenced. Permanently. Artistically.



The catalyst was simple. Predictable. I saw him yesterday, laughing with another man outside a cafe. Easy. Open. Unafraid. The rage boiled over, thick and black as tar, choking me. The point of no return wasn't the chloroform-soaked rag clamped over his mouth in the shadowed alley behind his studio. It was the \*moment before\*. Watching him adjust his scarf, humming some stupid tune, utterly oblivious to the monster breathing the same cold air. That tiny spark of normalcy, his utter vulnerability… it ignited the furnace inside. The transgression was minor – a kidnapping. But the \*pleasure\*… dragging his limp, warm weight into the van, arranging his limbs like a broken doll… it was exquisite. A promise tasted. The first brushstroke on a masterpiece of agony. I felt… \*alive\*. Justified. Cleansing the world, one screaming sinner at a time. Especially the ones who mirror the sin I drown in my own blood.

  
  


\*\*(Act II: The Descent)\*\*



Preparation is ritual. Sacred. Emil hangs spread-eagled from chains bolted into the meat hooks overhead, naked, pale skin gleaming with sweat under the single bare bulb. He whimpers, tries to speak around the filthy rag stuffed in his mouth. Futile. Beautiful. I trace the path of my knives across his trembling chest with a calloused fingertip – a conductor mapping the symphony. Flaying knife for the skin, boning knife for the deeper layers, cleaver for the grand finale. Each tool laid out on the stainless steel table, gleaming under the harsh light. My tools are extensions of my will. Sharpened this morning, the rhythmic \*scree-scree-scree\* against the whetstone a meditation. Each stroke honed the edge, honed my focus. Emil’s wide, terrified eyes track my movements. Good. Fear is the first note.

  


""See this?"" I rasp, picking up the thin, curved flaying knife. My voice sounds alien in the damp silence, a guttural scrape against concrete. ""Damascus steel. Folded a thousand times. Stronger than bone. More beautiful."" I run the cold, razor edge down the center of his sternum, not breaking skin. Just pressure. A promise. He jerks against the chains, a choked sob escaping. ""You paint love, boy. Soft touches. Warmth."" I lean closer, inhaling his terror-scent – sweat, bile, urine. ""I paint truth. The raw meat beneath the skin. The scream trapped in the throat."" My Baghdad accent thickens, roughens, dredging up the alleyways, the dust, the \*need\*. ""My father saw truth. A bullet painted it on the street. Red. Like your fucking canvases.""



Suddenly, the cleaver slams down onto the steel table beside him. \*CLANG!\* Emil screams into the gag, convulsing. Sparks fly. A tremor runs through him, vibrating the chains. A small victory. Satisfying. Predictable. They always scream at the loud noises. Always flinch. Like rabbits frozen in headlights. Pathetic. Predictable. My scar pulls tight as I smirk. ""You think your art matters? Your little lies of acceptance?"" I spit the word like poison. ""It’s weakness. Decay. I cut it out. Cleanse the world."" The justification tastes familiar, metallic, like blood. It coats the hollow inside, fills it for a moment. The memory flickers – my mother’s tears falling onto stolen bread, my youngest sister’s skeletal hand clutching mine. I had to be hard. Sharp. Like this knife. No room for softness. No room for \*that\* gasp in the dark alley. Emil’s whimpers sound… similar. It makes my knuckles ache. I clench the flaying knife tighter.

superficial beauty. He contrasts Emil's paintings of love with his violent actions, invoking Baghdad memories and his father's bullet-riddled death. Slamming the cleaver startles Emil into screaming. Jamal justifies his torture as cleansing perceived weakness, linking his brutality to childhood trauma: providing for his starving family necessitated hardness, suppressing his own softness/desires. Emil's whimpers evoke Jamal's past, causing inner conflict reflected in his tightening grip on the knife.



The blade bites. Not deep. Just a shallow incision, a crimson line drawn diagonally across his pectoral muscle. A gasp ripped from him, muffled but raw. Blood beads, then wells, tracing a slow, hot path down his ribs. I watch, fascinated. The color is… vibrant. More real than any pigment he ever smeared on canvas. My own pulse thuds in my ears, a counterpoint to his ragged breathing. This is control. This is power distilled. He tries to twist away, muscles straining uselessly against the iron bonds. His eyes plead – big, brown, drowning in terror. It’s almost erotic, that abject helplessness. A twisted mirror held up to my own buried shame. The rage surges, hot and familiar. I see his laughing cafe companion. His stupid, happy paintings. \*Why does he get to be happy?\*



""Look at you,"" I growl, leaning in until my scarred face is inches from his. My breath smells of stale coffee and violence. ""Skin like milk. Soft. Untouched."" My free hand grips his jaw, forcing him to meet my dead-black eyes. ""I’ll carve the sin out of you. Show you the rot underneath."" Another slash, parallel to the first. Blood flows faster now, pooling in the hollow of his collarbone before dripping onto the filthy floor. \*Plink. Plink.\* The sound is hypnotic. Emil’s choked cries escalate. Tears stream down his cheeks, mingling with sweat and blood. Good. Cry. Bleed. Suffer for the sin I carry. Suffer for my father’s corpse. Suffer for the boy I couldn’t afford to be.



Suddenly, the overhead bulb flickers violently. Darkness stutters, plunging the chamber into terrifying near-blackness for a heartbeat, two. Emil’s scream is pure, unfiltered panic. When the light steadies, his eyes are wide, unfocused, darting wildly. \*Weakness\*. Fear of the dark. Childish. Exploitable. My grin stretches, pulling at the scar tissue. ""Afraid of the dark, painter boy?"" I chuckle, a low, grating sound. ""You should be. It’s where monsters live."" I pick up the boning knife – thinner, sharper, designed for precision work between joints. ""Where \*I\* lived."" The memory flashes, unwanted: Baghdad nights, huddled in rubble, listening for death squads. The dark \*was\* death. Now it’s mine. I plunge the boning knife deep into the meat of his thigh, just above the knee. Not a vital spot. Just agony. Emil arches off the chains, a strangled shriek tearing through the gag. Blood pulses hot and slick over my fingers. The intimacy of it – skin parting, muscle yielding to my blade – sends a jolt of dark electricity through me. I twist the blade slowly, savoring the wet resistance, the choked gurgles vibrating through his throat. His body trembles violently against the restraints. \*This\* is truth. Flesh yielding. Pain screaming. Not his fucking paintings.



""See?"" I rasp, leaning close enough to smell the sour tang of his terror on his breath. My scarred lips brush his ear. ""This is \*real\*. This is the color beneath your lies."" My other hand drifts down his trembling flank, rough fingers tracing the shallow cuts already weeping crimson. Then lower. Down the smooth plane of his belly, trembling under my touch. Lower still. He flinches violently, tries to twist away. Futile. Predictable. My hand closes possessively around his soft, vulnerable flesh. He whimpers, a high-pitched, desperate sound muffled by the rag. The sound ignites something primal, filthy. It’s not arousal, not as others know it. It’s \*dominion\*. Absolute control over life, over fear, over the very thing that whispers my own damnation.



""Your art celebrated \*this\*,"" I sneer, tightening my grip cruelly. He gasps, eyes squeezing shut. ""Filth. Degeneracy."" The hypocrisy tastes like ash, but it fuels the furnace. I see the cafe again, his easy laughter. \*He gets to feel joy. He gets to feel touch without pain.\* The rage surges, black and choking. With brutal efficiency, I slice through his trousers' remnants, exposing him completely. My gaze rakes over him – pale, trembling, utterly helpless. The boning knife glints as I bring it close to his most intimate flesh. ""Let’s paint a new masterpiece,"" I growl, my voice thick with a perverse hunger. ""Let’s carve the sin \*out\*."" Emil’s eyes snap open, wild with understanding. He bucks wildly, chains clanging, a frantic, animalistic plea trapped behind the gag. Suddenly, I drop the knife onto the steel table with a clatter. His momentary confusion is delicious. Then I unbuckle my leather belt. The rasp of leather, the clink of metal buckles… it’s a sound far more terrifying than the knife’s scrape. His struggles cease. He stares, frozen in pure, paralyzing dread. The leather creaks as I pull it free. My fingers, slick with his blood from the thigh wound, fumble with my own trousers. The scent of blood mixes with my own stale sweat, a potent musk of violence and violation. ""You glorified this sin,"" I snarl, positioning myself. The thick leather belt bites into his hip as I anchor myself. He whimpers, tries to shrink away. I grip his hips, forcing him still. My own flesh is hard, not from desire, but from the raw, twisted power of it. The utter violation. The destruction of everything he represented. The destruction of the ghost \*I\* see in his terrified eyes – the ghost of the boy I could have been. The ghost I have to kill, over and over. There’s no tenderness. Only force. A brutal invasion. Emil screams. A raw, ragged sound muffled but agonizingly loud in the concrete tomb. Tears stream down his face, mingling with sweat and blood. His body convulses against the intrusion. \*Good\*. Suffer. Suffer for the weakness. Suffer for my father. Suffer for every gasp I ever choked back in the dark. Each thrust is a hammer blow against his being, against the false peace of his paintings. I watch his face contort, the agony beyond physical pain etched into his features. It’s ecstasy. Not pleasure, but \*power\*. The ultimate desecration. Proof that his love, his acceptance, his \*art\*… is nothing. Dust. Easily shattered. Easily defiled. I am the sculptor now. My medium is terror. My brush is pain. My canvas bleeds beneath me, screaming silently for a mercy that died with my innocence in Baghdad. This is my redemption. My cleansing fire. Writ in blood and agony on the flesh of a sinner.



\*\*(Act II: The Descent - Continued)\*\*



The rhythmic violence becomes a dark liturgy. Emil’s choked cries, the wet slap of flesh, the groan of stressed chains – it’s the symphony I conduct. My scar pulls tight with each savage movement. Sweat stings my eyes. The air reeks of copper, fear-sweat, and something deeper, muskier, the scent of utter degradation. My movements are mechanical, driven by a deep-seated compulsion that transcends lust. It’s annihilation. Of him. Of the symbol he became. Of the phantom self-loathing that whispers in my own skull every time I see a man touch another without flinching.



Suddenly, a flash. Not the bulb this time. A memory. Baghdad. Twelve years old. Huddled behind a burnt-out tank. Two men. Soldiers? Insurgents? Doesn't matter. Locked in a desperate embrace against the crumbling wall, mouths fused, hands clutching like lifelines in the dust-choked twilight. Hidden. Furtive. \*Terrified\*. Like rats. The image hits me like a physical blow. Emil’s agonized face blurs. I see \*their\* faces – the raw need, the sheer terror of being discovered. The same terror radiating from Emil now. The rage surges, hotter, fouler. I slam into him harder, grinding bone against bone. \*They were weak too\*. Hiding their sin. Pretending it was love. Pretending it wasn't filth. Emil’s scream pitches higher. I grip his throat, not enough to choke, enough to feel the frantic pulse beneath my fingers, the desperate flutter of life fighting extinction. My own rhythm falters. The twisted pleasure curdles into something sharper, more acidic. Shame. Self-disgust. Why does \*this\* image surface now? Why \*them\*? Their terrified passion mirrors Emil’s terrified agony. Both states are vulnerability. Both are… pitiful. My climax approaches, a dark wave building not from pleasure, but from the sheer, overwhelming \*power\* of destruction. It’s a release valve for the pressure cooker of hate inside me. I roar – a wordless, guttural sound ripped from the Baghdad alleyways – as I spill into him, a violation deeper than the physical. It’s marking territory. Claiming victory over the symbol. Over the weakness. Over \*myself\*. The aftermath is immediate. Silence. Heavy, punctuated only by Emil’s ragged, wet sobs and the drip-drip-drip of blood from his thigh onto concrete. I pull away, breathing hard, the leather belt digging into my own hip. The boning knife gleams on the table, forgotten momentarily. The void inside yawns wider, colder. The momentary satiation evaporates, leaving only the familiar, gnawing emptiness. Emil hangs limp, broken. His eyes are glazed, distant. Not defiance. Not even fear anymore. Just… vacancy. Shock. He’s retreated somewhere deep inside, away from the pain. Unacceptable. My masterpiece isn't finished. The symphony needs its final, shattering note. The catharsis demands completion. The cleansing fire must consume everything. I reach for the cleaver. Its heavy weight settles into my palm, familiar, grounding. Damascus steel, like my flaying knife, but thicker. Brutal. Meant for severing bone. For finality. I lift it, the light catching the intricate folds in the metal. Beautiful. Deadly. Like truth. Emil doesn't react. Doesn’t flinch. His gaze remains fixed somewhere on the dripping ceiling. This isn't fear. This is… surrender. Disgusting. Cowardly. He doesn't deserve the mercy of numbness. I need him \*here\*. Present. Suffering. Understanding the price of his sin, his art, his very existence. ""Look at me!"" The command cracks like a whip. He doesn't move. His chest hitches with shallow breaths. Blood paints intricate patterns on his pale skin where the shallow cuts weep. My masterpiece remains unfinished. The rage reignites, white-hot. I grasp his chin, forcing his head up. His eyes meet mine – unfocused, empty. Like dirty windows. ""SEE!"" I roar, shaking him violently. The chains clang. His head lolls. Nothing. The fury boils over. Suddenly, without conscious thought, the cleaver arcs down. Not aimed at bone. Not yet. Aimed at connection. At forcing him back. The heavy blade bites deep into the meat of his shoulder. \*THUNK\*. A wet, meaty sound. Bone grinds against steel. Emil screams. A raw, primal shriek ripped from the core of his being. The vacant eyes snap wide, flooding with pure, unadulterated agony. He convulses violently, chains screaming against their anchors. Blood erupts, a crimson fountain soaking my forearm, spraying across my scarred chest. \*There\*. There it is. The pain. The terror. The raw, bleeding \*now\*. Beautiful. Finally. He’s back. Present for the grand finale. His screams echo off the concrete, a raw, desperate counterpoint to my own harsh breathing. I wrench the cleaver free. Bone fragments glisten red amidst the mangled flesh. The void inside whispers its approval. This is the truth he painted over. This is the color beneath the lie. This is \*me\*. Sculpting reality in screams and shattered bone. I raise the cleaver again, aiming for the juncture of neck and shoulder. To sever the head. The ultimate statement. The compass point north. The cleansing is almost complete. Emil’s screams crescendo. His eyes lock on mine, pleading, understanding. Seeing the void reflected back at him. Perfect. My scar pulls tight. A grimace. Or a smile. It’s hard to tell anymore. The cleaver descends.



\*\*\*



\*\*(Act III: The Final Stain)\*\*



The silence after the cleaver’s final blow is profound. Deafening. Only the dripping remains. Blood. Other fluids. From the chains. From the ruin slumped against the wall. The head stares blankly from its crude perch atop Emil’s discarded easel – a macabre parody of an artist’s still life. North. The compass point settled. The cleansing fire burned hot, leaving only ash and silence. The void inside yawns, vast and echoing. I stand amidst the carnage, breathing the thick, metallic air. The rage has subsided. The frantic energy expended. Only numbness remains. A familiar companion. The chains hang slack, empty. My tools lie scattered on the stained steel table, slick with gore. My own body is painted crimson – sticky, cooling. The leather belt hangs loose. The ritual is complete. Yet… the emptiness persists. Deeper, somehow. Unfilled by the symphony of agony. Emil’s vacant eyes in his severed head seem to accuse me. Not of murder. Of… futility. The thought ignites a flicker of something cold and ugly. Not rage. Disappointment? I shake my head, a sharp jerk. Weakness. The cleansing \*was\* complete. He is gone. His sin, his art, his weakness – eradicated. I am the sculptor. The void is my canvas. This silence is my masterpiece. Suddenly, a pressure builds low in my gut. Bladder-full. A mundane, animal need. I stare down at the ruin of Emil. The pale torso slumped awkwardly, the gaping neck wound still weeping sluggishly. The head watching. My boot nudges his hip. Nothing. Utter stillness. The pressure intensifies. An idea forms, simple, crude, utterly fitting. A final desecration. A baptism in filth. Proof that even in death, his weakness remains. My domain. I unlace my trousers, the movement practical, unhurried. The leather creaks. I step closer to the headless torso. The stench of blood and voided bowels is overpowering. Good. Real. I position myself over the gaping wound in his shoulder, where the cleaver bit deepest. The flesh is mangled, raw. I let go. A hot, yellow stream arcs out, striking the ragged flesh with a soft hiss. Steam rises faintly in the cool air. The urine mixes with the congealing blood, washing rivulets of pinkish fluid down the pale skin, pooling in the hollow of his belly. I watch, detached. A mundane act rendered obscene. The ultimate dismissal. A dog marking territory. Emil is less than carrion now. Just… waste. As the stream tapers off, a final shudder runs through the cooling torso. A nerve spasm? Air escaping a collapsed lung? It doesn't matter. It’s over. The void yawns wider. Satisfied? Perhaps. Emptied? Never. I refasten my trousers, the leather stiff with dried blood. I turn my back on the tableau. The head stares blankly. My tools need cleaning. Sharpen the cleaver. The flaying knife. Prepare for the next canvas. The hunt begins anew. Dawn will find me walking Tiergarten’s paths, the scent of linden trees failing to mask the phantom coppery tang clinging to my skin. Scanning faces. Seeking the next symbol of weakness to carve into screaming truth. The silence of the slaughterhouse is my chapel. The dripping blood, my benediction. The void, my only comfort. Until the next note needs composing. Until the next sin demands cleansing. Until the next scream fills the echoing emptiness, if only for a moment.

1nd1xoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentists/comments/1nd1xoq/dark_stains_in_between_my_teeth_gapswhat_could/,Dark Stains in between my teeth gaps…what could possibly cause this?,"My teeth was all good until the fall of 2024, nice and white with barely any stains.

I always brush my teeth twice a day, espeicailly after eating. I even use mouthwash daily. 

I don’t drink alcohols,  I don’t smoke, I don’t drink teas and I don’t drink coffee.

Everything was good until suddenly there are dark and obvious stains appear in my teeth gap, I’ve never had something like that before. By the time I noticed, they are already so dark in between my teeth that it made my teeth look “dirty” and seem like I  have big teeth gap and made my teeth look ugly.

I’ve discussed  with my dentist but he wasn’t able to tell me exactly why…

I’ve really just been doing same things I’ve been doing to maintain my teeth health, and  suddenly those stains appear. My dentist were able to get some off through teeth wash (or teeth Cleaning I forgot what’s it called but its the thing you do every six  months ), but some of the stains are still stuck in my teeth gap make my teeth gaps black and they bug my so so much. 

I evaluated everything I did that could caused this and i came across some articles saying some fluoride  toothpastes could cause teeth stains? Would that probably be the case ?  Especially since the fall of 2024, my mom bought me a new toothpaste from japan, and ingredients were written in Japanese, is it possible that Japanese’s toothpaste contains too much fluoride that caused this?

But when I talked to my denlist he told me that it’s likely not the case…

so I am so clueless right now as what exactly ruined my teeth…

And seems like those stains stuck in between my teethgaps will be there forever, the only way to get my teeth look good again is through dental veneers? but those are so expensive…

have anyone have the same experience??

Is my teethgaps fr cooked?

Jem had decided to host the meeting in the morning and try his hand at making coffee beyond the bitter, cheap liquid he has gotten used to quickly preparing before his shifts at the Medic cabin.

Cleaning does not take long usually, but Jem is thorough and takes time to think. The battles thus far have been overwhelming but the campers at the Battle of New London did better. There were fewer losses, and that is an improvement. A victory that raises spirits.

The trials of Themis would blemish that morale the moment they put any camper on trial but war without rules is senseless killing. It would happen either way.

***

Early the next morning, the smell of coffee filters throughout the Hebe cabin, contrasted by the savory scent of pastries. The pastries are not Jem's creations, with him having bought them premade the day before.

It is not long before the meeting begins, the few children of Hebe and campers from outside that gather and Jem settles at the head of a prepared table. He holds himself still for a moment, waiting until the small talk the gathered campers trade between themselves dies down, and when it does, he presses a hand down, voice quiet but firm.

""I am holding this meeting to discuss recent happenings. We have scored a great victory over Atlas's forces in New London and that has given us a moment, time to rally and heal. But different people heal in different ways, physically and mentally. Some heal faster with more rest, and others prefer to ease themselves back into activity sooner and achieve better results that way. With the trials coming, things will change.""

Brown half-curls bob for a moment as the Hebe counselor nods to himself. ""So as the war progresses, we must stay strong. You all heal and ease your minds in different ways, so it would be beneficial for me if you told me your methods. I will try to use that to work on lessons and activities that will help ease the tension of the current situations.""

A moment of silence after he finishes speaking, he perks up slightly, eyes scanning the table. ""If you do not feel comfortable speaking to me about this, do not force yourself. Simply enjoy some coffee or tea and have a pastry.""

Then he settles back, eyes attentive as he sips his coffee. Taking time to brew it properly helps the taste somewhat, he muses absently.

To set expectations, I'm willing to travel to your location as long as it's not far away than Manila or Quezon City Areas. If you're from Tarlac or Pangasinan, all the better.

**For both of our safety:** Let's exchange pictures of ourselves in DMs (we can also do it on TG or WhatsApp, if you want). Just to be sure we can trust each other. If we end up both being attracted to each other by seeing our pictures, then let's go for it! Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. I personally think ""Spark"" is important in any relationships and it's better if we're both attracted to each other physically FIRST before anything else, then we can go from there. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. Safety first!

Right now the only options around here are mailing film out or driving pretty far. I’d love to give people a local option — but instead of having strangers come to my house, I’m hoping to partner with a local spot (coffee shop, record store, vintage shop, etc.) that could host a secure drop-off box. Customers would leave their film there, I’d pick it up, and then return the finished scans/negatives. Super simple, no extra work for the business.

The upside for the shop is some extra foot traffic and being known as a supporter of local art/analog culture. I’m happy to trade services, hook the shop up with free prints, or figure out another way to make it worth their while.

If you run a local business (or know someone who does) and think this could be a good fit, I’d love to chat. Even just hearing if folks think this idea would be useful here would help me out a ton.

Everything was good until suddenly there are stains appear in my teeth gap, I’ve never had something like that before. By the time I noticed, they are already so dark in between my teeth that it made my teeth look “dirty” and seem like I  have big teeth gap and made my teeth look ugly.⬇️

I’ve discussed  with my dentist but he wasn’t able to tell me exactly why…

I don’t drink alcohols,  I don’t smoke, I don’t drink teas and I don’t drink coffee.

I’ve really just been doing same things I’ve been doing to maintain my teeth health, and  suddenly those stains appear. My dentist were able to get some off through teeth wash (or teeth Cleaning I forgot what’s it called but its the thing you do every six  months ), but some of the stains are still stuck in my teeth gap make my teeth gaps black and they bug my so so much.

(those blacks looks like teeth gaps but they are just stains…)  


I evaluated everything I did that could caused this and i came across some articles saying some fluoride  toothpastes could cause teeth stains? Would that probably be the case ?  Especially since the fall of 2024, my mom bought me a new toothpaste from japan, and ingredients were written in Japanese, is it possible that Japanese’s toothpaste contains too much fluoride that caused this?

But when I talked to my denlist he told me that it’s likely not the case…

so I am so clueless right now as what exactly ruined my teeth…

And seems like those stains stuck in between my teethgaps will be there forever, the only way to get my teeth look good again is through dental veneers? but those are so expensive…

have anyone have the same experience??

Are my teeth gaps fr cooked?

Long story short I deal with bad bad bad anxiety daily, and I'm also a single parent who stays awake way too late and works full time which doesn't help, so I have been for years drinking coffee and more recently started drinking coke Zero which I never used to, which has made my anxiety worse than it's ever been. 

On Sunday I drank a large coffee as usual in the AM, then I had a large Pepsi zero with lunch, and then another coke Zero around 3:30 pm, which then proceeded to give me to date the absolute worst and most uncomfortable panic attack I have ever experienced, I legitimately thought I was having a heart attack and nearly called 911, but I used to smoke weed years ago and was used to just breathing it off, but this one was not going away, 20 minutes of panic, I have never felt my heart beat the way it did, you would have thought someone was holding a gun to my head, it did eventually stop but it was the most unpleasant attack to date. 

Recent I have been feeling really down and more anxiety than usual leading up to the day I previously described, while I usually have my good and bad days the bad days seemed to be coming more often, so I decided to quit caffeine as a hail Mary to stop my anxiety from getting worse than necessary without being medicated. 

Fast forward to today I'm not going to tell you I feel amazing, I feel weird, I'm extremely tired, irritable, a bit depressed, it reminds of the feeling of a bad breakup that's my best way to describe it. 

However, noticeably better sleep the past two nights, I could barely keep my eyes open past 10pm last night which never happens, less anxiety during the day as well but I think the bad feeling I have lingering still is caffeine withdrawal as I've consumed 400mg or more a day for over 10 years. So far I don't think caffeine was the sole reason for my anxiety but I will update in a week or a month with now I'm feeling, I did have a slight panic attack earlier but it was much more mild than usual, my heart wasn't racing, and it was after I went for a long walk, just felt very worried and tired, not sure why.

This is my first machine, and I want to get into making my own coffee

I buy beans from a local shop. Typically, I get them ~10 days after they've been roasted, and finish them max 30 days before they've been roasted. The beans I get are a Colombian bean, I believe light/medium.

I have the Krups GX450 (budget one from Costco until I buy a Baratza grinder) which I found was not grinding anywhere near fine, so I asked the roaster to grind my beans to espresso level, and they did. This came out much finer, and let me finally get a creama.

However, it's still running fast. I can't get it to a honey/syrup consistency, but the taste is still there, and has almost the same taste as when I buy coffee from the roaster.

I use 17.9-18.1 of ground coffee. I don't have a WDT tool, but I break clumps with a paper clip. I use the tamper it comes with, and tamp just until the silver ring is hidden. I then put a screen on, and run the machine.

I'm still working on dialing the liquid, but I get ~38 mL in ~20 seconds from when I press the button. The actual espresso comes out in ~7 seconds.

What could I be doing wrong? Do I need to ask my roaster to grind finer? I didn't see a huge improvement in consistency between my grind and theirs, however, my grinds felt like they could exfoliate my skin, and their grinds feels exactly like thin sand.

Not the kind of tired you shake off with coffee. I mean the kind that settles in your chest, that makes you stare at the ceiling wondering how you’re gonna make it through the week.

I’ve got two kids—Zayden’s nine, and little Nova just turned five. They’re my heartbeat. And right now, I’m scared I won’t be able to keep a roof over their heads.

The rent’s overdue. Again. I’ve been dodging calls from the landlord, hoping I can scrape something together before Friday. I’ve picked up every gig I could find—moving furniture, fixing fences, even hauling junk for cash. But it’s never enough. Groceries, gas, school supplies—it all adds up faster than I can earn.

I used to work construction. Steady pay, long hours, but I could handle it. Then the company downsized and let me go. Said they’d “keep me in mind.” That was six months ago. I’ve been grinding ever since, but the jobs are spotty and the bills don’t wait.

I try to keep things normal for the kids. We eat dinner by flashlight when the power’s out and call it a “campfire night.” I tell them we’re just switching things up, making memories. Zayden’s old enough to know something’s off, but he doesn’t ask. He just hugs me tighter before bed.

I haven’t cried in front of them. Not once. I save that for the shower, where they can’t hear me. I look at myself in the mirror and wonder if I’m failing. If I’m enough.

I called a few shelters. Most are full. Some won’t take dads with kids. I keep thinking, “Just one more day. One more break.”

But breaks don’t come easy.

Still—I wake up. I make Nova’s pancakes in the shape of hearts. I walk Zayden to school and tell him to be a leader. I smile like I’m not drowning. Because they deserve that. They deserve a dad who fights, even when he’s losing.

And maybe that’s what I am. A fighter. Bruised, broke, but still swinging.",1,1757468697.0,SingleDads,0,1.0,False

Please if you're (the person I met) reading this, don't take it personally! I have no friends so I'm letting it out here!

So I posted in a city sub about meeting someone a week or two ago and got a DM from a girl! She was 3 years older than me, relatively more mature (in her own words) and slightly more settled in life! 

I was a bit hesitant at first, but we moved from reddit to telegram/WhatsApp and for the past week had very deep conversations (was mostly me ranting TBH and a bit from her side as well) and calls sometimes reached almost to 6 hours!

I was thinking of her in some romantic sense in the beginning, but later mutually decided that we should just be friends! If I look back, it was me who lashed out and demand clarity from her and she just wanted to be friends! I accepted it, since I currently don't even have that luxury!

We finally decided to meet today! I don't have a car at the moment and its pouring heavy, so for me it was either risk getting soaking wet or book a cab for a 50km round trip! I booked a cab!

The moment I met her! Her face was BLANK! Absolutely emotionless! She told me that she kinda has an emotionless face, but I thought she'll feel a bit easy once we start talking. Never Happened! It was like a switch turned on and she shut down the emotions we had on call! It's not like we didn't see each other before! The very first thing I did was share some of my photos, like back from an year when I looked okayish! Right now there isn't any change as such but I've shaved my head and have a very scruffy beard!

Anyways, I've been on friendly get togethers but this was soooo COLD! there wasn't even a friendly handshake! We just went to the food courtyard and I waddled behind her anxiously while she selected food! I realized I was getting a bit feverish mid way so I let her finish the food while I sipped coffee and ate just a tiny bit! 

I tried my best to hold a conversation! I was too conscious and nervous! Not because It was nerve wreaking meeting her, but I'm someone who ""looks"" a bit above average, but right now I have a shaved head and a very unkempt beard! So I was just hoping no one recognizes me from my hometown and I was comically vigilant!

I kept trying to get her interested but I knew the meeting had BOMBED! But I felt betrayed! Throughout our calls, I reminded her repeatedly that I've been judged my whole life on my looks because my brother's a model/actor and it was only recently in my life that my genes hit and I started looking a bit good and a lot less fugly! 

While talking, I simply nudged her that, if I don't get any cues, just say it straight to my face! And she did! She said she wanted to be left alone!

I exited the mall! Puked on the sidewalk! Booked a cab and went back home! Had a chat with her on what happened and she still doesn't have the honesty to tell me what went wrong! 

She's insistent on it being my mental state and that she was only entertaining me because she felt bad! Continously sending me help guides on mental health!

I am not able to wish ill will on her, as my brain just refuses to blame anyone but myself!

This was the first time I had opened myself and become vulnerable with someone only with the incentive of getting a friend who GETS me!
After repeated disclaimers that she wouldn't judge me by my current state, she did!

I'm very sad! My whole Outlook is shattered! I was of the thought that if I'd learn to be vulnerable, I'll grow! And maybe my unlucky streak with women would end as I had a very reserved emotional behaviour previously!

I botched what could've been a good friendship! She kept reminding me that we're verryy different! My brain refused to register as I was fixated on those long calls and was expecting the same!

I know I trauma dumped on her! But I didn't deserve getting pulled 40 km in pouring rain across the city just to get whatever it was! TBH! If she would've explained that to my face! I would've been relieved! Guess I didn't even deserve that!

I'm completely numb! Only reason I can think of my weird behavior is that I've never been the one approaching as all my previous girlfriends made the first move! This was sort of a first move from me and I got burned badd!

I didn't wanna meet her like at all! I was so happy with just those calls. It was her who pushed me saying she couldn't sustain this kind of friendship and would prefer meeting a lot more!

I don't want any suggestions really but I'll take kindness if it comes this way! Thanks!",1,1757468622.0,AskIndianWomen,11,0.57,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 31M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. 

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play video games. I'm obsessed with Satisfactory at the moment.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

My son and his girlfriend lived at their respective homes about 15 -25 minutes away. My son's friend moved from out of state. They've only been in the apartment for about three weeks. This past weekend was my first visit to the apartment. I live a few hours away and decided to load up my car with some stuff that I thought they'd appreciate and can use. A few pots, baking sheets, vacuum, serving tray and large queen size really really soft blanket that I had picked up from WalMart years ago. The coffee maker they didn't want as they already had one. In the past when my son would spend time at my place that blanket would be the one that he would use and it was his favorite blanket. I had started to use it more and more often lately because it was a really soft and warm blanket. This weekend came and went and when I was driving home I felt really sad about the blanket and the serving tray.

I kind of feel like everything I gave him. I'm not saying I want to take it back but I almost have that feeling like I want to take it back. I'm not sure if maybe because I feel like he's ungrateful for it or maybe because I don't know why? I think maybe with the blanket it's because whenever he would spend time here that was his blanket and he never really spent a significant amount of time with me like during the divorce and even prior or after, at my house at least and I think having that blanket here was like having a piece of him here and now it's gone.

We’ve had alot of differences and problems over the years but we always try to work them out together. Last year I met this man at a coffee shop and I never thought anything of it at first, he worked there and was always super nice to me and really sweet. I would go there with my partner as well so I never second guessed any of my conversations with the man. After a few times of visiting and even going with friends, my partner started to become very wary of our conversations and would accuse me of doing things I didnt do and say we were flirting and looking at eachother seductively and that his friends could say the same. I can admit the conversations made me feel nice but I was never sexually attracted to him. Fast forward to now, its been a year of seeing him maybe once or twice a month at his job and I cant stop thinking about him. He makes me feel special and lit up inside and SEEN. It feels so nice to be greeted with a smile and have someones full attention and have an engaging conversation with someone who is sincerely nice to me. I feel so beautiful when he looks at me and cant stop smiling. Ive had so many dreams of us in a relationship, married, having kids, scenarios of us dating. I get butterflies everytime he smiles at me and I miss his hugs. He always sends me off with a long tight hug and a kiss on the cheek and it feels like im walking on clouds afterwards.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KBO Showdown: SSG Landers vs. NC Dinos – A Rain-Drenched Rivalry with a Clear Forecast**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your umbrellas and your popcorn, because the KBO is dishing up a doubleheader of drama, rain delays, and pitching mismatches! On September 10, the SSG Landers (1.59 decimal odds) and NC Dinos (2.3 decimal odds) clash in a game that’s as clear-cut as a math teacher’s coffee supply—*if* you ignore the rain that’s been drenching Changwon like a Korean summer monsoon. Let’s break this down with the precision of a radar gun and the humor of a ballpark hotdog vendor who’s seen it all.

---

### The Odds: SSG’s Pitcher is a Math Teacher’s Dream, NC’s is a Sieve

The numbers scream “SSG Landers” louder than a fan in the stands yelling “*야!*” (That’s “Hey!” in Korean, for the uninitiated). SSG’s starter, **Drew Anderson**, arrives with a 2.11 ERA, a stat so pristine it could pass for a spreadsheet error. Meanwhile, NC’s Shin Min-hyuk (5.17 ERA) looks like he’s pitching from a leaky sieve—every time he touches the mound, you half-expect water to start pooling around his cleats.

Converting the decimal odds to implied probabilities? SSG’s 1.59 translates to a **62.9% chance to win**, while NC’s 2.3 implies a **43.5% shot**. The gap is wider than the difference between a KBO fan’s hopes and the reality of their team’s bullpen. The spread (-1.5 for SSG, +1.5 for NC) and total (8.5 runs) also favor SSG, suggesting bookmakers see this as a low-scoring duel… or maybe they’re just tired of rescheduling games due to rain.

---

### The News: Rain, Reschedules, and a National Team’s Mid-Life Crisis

Let’s not forget the *real* drama: the KBO’s September 9 games were canceled due to rain, leaving fans high and dry. The KBO’s solution? A doubleheader on September 17.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KBO Showdown: Samsung Lions vs. Kia Tigers – A Rain-Drenched Rivalry Reborn**

The Korean Baseball Organization’s (KBO) rescheduled clash between the **Samsung Lions** and **Kia Tigers** on September 10, 2025, promises to be a slugfest of strategy, sponsor shenanigans, and pitching prowess. Let’s dissect this matchup with the precision of a catcher framing a pitch and the humor of a comedian tripping over their own shoelaces.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Tigers Roar, Lions Prowl

The **Kia Tigers** enter as favorites, with decimal odds hovering around **1.69-1.71** (implied probability: \~59-60%). The **Samsung Lions**, meanwhile, sit at **2.1-2.2** (\~45-48%), suggesting bookmakers view them as the underdog. The spread favors the Tigers at **-1.5** (odds: \~2.35-2.5), while the Lions offer a **+1.5** line (odds: \~1.5-1.6). For totals, the **Under 8.5 runs** is narrowly favored (\~51-56%), while the Over hovers at **53-55%**.

Key stats? The Tigers’ starter, **James Nail (8-4, 2.32 ERA)**, is a Cy Young contender in a league where ERAs are as fickle as a toddler’s bedtime routine. The Lions counter with **Herson Garavito (4-3, 2.54 ERA)**, whose ERA is “respectable” if you’ve had three cups of coffee and a nap. Both pitchers have faced similar competition, but Nail’s 8-4 record screams “I belong on a Wheaties box,” while Garavito’s 4-3 ledger whispers, “I’m here for the free hot dogs.”

### News Digest: Sponsor Day Shenanigans and Rainy Rants

The Tigers are hosting a **Puhon Hyundai Life Sponsor Day**, complete with a mascot named **“Puni”** serving as the game’s announcer. Imagine a costumed character with a megaphone shouting, “Vamos, Kia! Vamos!” while tripping over a foul line. It’s equal parts charming and chaotic—a recipe for either magical team chemistry or a mid-game distraction. The Lions, meanwhile, have no such distractions, but let’s be honest: Their best PR move was probably not having a mascot named “Lion-o” who yells, “ROAR! I mean… \*st

A quick one today!

Huge shout out to u/SirG2020 for hooking me up with this beauty!

These old ones are always so much fun!

Pics 1-3 show the contents.  Love those spoons!

Pic 4 shows the coffee (why are they 2 different colors), Vanilla Fudge (yes, it has Rancid carved in it), the sugar and creamer. But Waffels,  why did you put them on a plate instead of in your belly? Great question, because they were rancid. No Bueno. That Vanilla Fudge fudged everything in there. 

Pics 5-6 show the hot cocoa delaminating and prepared.1 sip, rancid city. That one hurt to pour out because I know it's great stuff!

Pic 7 is the stew in all its glory. 100% perfectly fine in every way. Super savory, very thick, ample hearty beef chunks....this would have been amazing in the field back then for sure! Was this better than the 96 RCW beef stew? I don't think so. Freshness may be playing a factor in that assessment. 

What a great experience trying these older rations! Some components are perfect one time and then bad the next, with no rhyme or reason! It makes it that much more fun!

As always, be careful when eating old rations.

Take Care folks!

When we hit a plateau, the advice is usually to ""eat less, move more."" But sometimes that just leads to more frustration. Instead of grinding harder, what if you could **diagnose the specific reason** you're stuck?

I call this method **The Weight Loss Compass**. When you're lost, a compass doesn't tell you to just ""walk faster""—it gives you a **direction**. Think of these four points as your directional signals. Check each one to find your true north.

# 📍 Point 1: The Calorie Creep (Check Your ""True North"")

* **The Signal:** You're *sure* you're eating the same, but the scale won't move.
* **The Diagnosis:** Your ""maintenance calories"" have decreased as you've lost weight, or small, unmeasured extras (oil, snacks, drinks) have subtly added up.
* **How to Recalibrate:** Don't just cut calories blindly. Do a **7-day ""audit""**: weigh and track everything—even the handful of nuts or the coffee creamer—with brutal honesty. You're not judging, you're investigating. This often reveals the hidden drift.

# 📍 Point 2: The Stress & Sleep Sabotage (Check Your ""West"")

* **The Signal:** You're exhausted, craving sugar and salty carbs, and feeling irritable.
* **The Diagnosis:** High cortisol (from stress or poor sleep) is prioritizing fat storage, especially around the midsection, and ramping up hunger hormones.
* **How to Recalibrate:** This isn't about food. **Your goal isn't a calorie deficit; it's a stress deficit.** Prioritize one extra hour of sleep or a 10-minute daily walk without your phone. Reduce the pressure, not the calories.

# 📍 Point 3: The Adaptation Plateau (Check Your ""East"")

* **The Signal:** Your workouts feel easier, but you're not seeing changes.
* **The Diagnosis:** Your body has become efficient at your routine. Efficiency is the enemy of progress.
* **How to Recalibrate:** **Change the stimulus, not the duration.** If you always walk, add intervals (1 min fast, 2 mins slow). If you lift weights, change your reps (e.g., 5 heavy sets of 5 instead of 3 sets of 12). Confuse your muscles again.

# 📍 Point 4: The Hydration & Hormonal Mask (Check Your ""South"")

* **The Signal:** The scale is up 3-4 lbs overnight despite perfect eating.
* **The Diagnosis:** This is almost always water weight, not fat. Sodium, carbs, inflammation from new exercise, or your menstrual cycle can cause significant water retention that completely masks fat loss for days.
* **How to Recalibrate:** **Trust the process, not the daily scale.** Weigh yourself once a week under the same conditions (e.g., Friday morning) and look at the monthly trend. Drink more water to flush excess sodium.",3,1757467604.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.71,False

She consistently pleads poverty, claiming she can't afford groceries or bills, yet her Instagram tells a different story: daily coffee runs, professional photoshoots, facials, and fresh hair and nails. Her primary income seems to be from subpar digital artwork, sold to sympathetic followers under the false pretense of keeping her afloat.

The most egregious part of her scam, however, is the fraudulent medical claims. She allegedly lied about having cancer, stating she miraculously went into remission after just three chemo treatments—a medical improbability that exposes the entire charade.

· She claimed to be raped but provided only a fragment of the story, painting a man as ""creepy"" while leaving out her own role in the situation.
· She reported her car stolen but admitted to leaving her keys, purse, and all valuables inside it, then attacked anyone who questioned that decision as ""disrespectful.""

Not the kind of tired you shake off with coffee. I mean the kind that settles in your chest, that makes you stare at the ceiling wondering how you’re gonna make it through the week.

I’ve got two kids—Zayden’s nine, and little Nova just turned five. They’re my heartbeat. And right now, I’m scared I won’t be able to keep a roof over their heads.

The rent’s overdue. Again. I’ve been dodging calls from the landlord, hoping I can scrape something together before Friday. I’ve picked up every gig I could find—moving furniture, fixing fences, even hauling junk for cash. But it’s never enough. Groceries, gas, school supplies—it all adds up faster than I can earn.

I used to work construction. Steady pay, long hours, but I could handle it. Then the company downsized and let me go. Said they’d “keep me in mind.” That was six months ago. I’ve been grinding ever since, but the jobs are spotty and the bills don’t wait.

I try to keep things normal for the kids. We eat dinner by flashlight when the power’s out and call it a “campfire night.” I tell them we’re just switching things up, making memories. Zayden’s old enough to know something’s off, but he doesn’t ask. He just hugs me tighter before bed.

I haven’t cried in front of them. Not once. I save that for the shower, where they can’t hear me. I look at myself in the mirror and wonder if I’m failing. If I’m enough.

I called a few shelters. Most are full. Some won’t take dads with kids. I keep thinking, “Just one more day. One more break.”

But breaks don’t come easy.

Still—I wake up. I make Nova’s pancakes in the shape of hearts. I walk Zayden to school and tell him to be a leader. I smile like I’m not drowning. Because they deserve that. They deserve a dad who fights, even when he’s losing.

I’m relatively sensitive to medication, they started me off at 12.5 (half a 25, the lowest dose) and I think that was best. I do notice some side effects, but it wasn’t like I was expecting. It makes me feel a little nauseated at first, after like 2hrs of taking it. I don’t feel so sick I need to go to the bathroom or like i’m close to vomiting but it’s there.

Wake up well, good intentions, but soon you'll want to get a short extra nap or sleep in","Without a quick morning nap, about 90% of my day feels like I’m dragging around the constant urge to sleep just waiting for that one recharge to really kick things off. I’ll try breakfast, coffee but it's a hit and a miss. By the afternoon, I usually give in and nap.

When it’s a solid 15-minute power nap, a real nap-sleep where you close your eyes and black out, I wake up feeling refreshed, productive, and able to power through the rest of the day (and even into the night). But if that nap is disrupted? The rest of the day can feel extra miserable.

I know I probably am not getting enough deep sleep. There were times I went to sleep tired, I felt relaxed but the sleep was too good. Then somehow my mind and body betrays me saying we didn't get enough deep sleep. Other times it's the opposite, I'd have only a 4 hour sleep, then I'd feel kicking.

Every morning struggle: The best way I can describe it is like standing on the edge of a high cliff, ready to soar. You feel amazing, full of energy then suddenly, instead of flying, you just want to retreat, curl up, and sleep like a child. I can soar in a bit, just give me that nap. 

But we already literally SLEPT WE WERE IN BED FOR 8 HOURS AND MORE.

This happens to me a lot, especially when working from home. I think it’s because my body and mind don’t always know what to do with that fresh burst of energy (like, “HELLO, focus and get to work already!”). I’ve found that doing very small tasks sometimes helps, but they can get boring fast, and then I’m yawning again back to square one.

I’ve also experimented with fasting until dinner, so my only meal is in the evening. But I know that’s not sustainable long term especially since I’m pre-diabetic and can’t always get the best quality food. I’ve even cut back on chicken because I suspect it has too much theanine for me.

1nd0nk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1nd0nk0/scami/,S-C-A-M-I,"You may have heard of ""Scamanda,"" but I have a local grifter who gives her a run for her money. This individual has been running a complex con, manipulating people's empathy for financial gain while living a lifestyle that completely contradicts her stated struggles.

She consistently pleads poverty, claiming she can't afford groceries or bills, yet her Instagram tells a different story: daily coffee runs, professional photoshoots, facials, and fresh hair and nails. Her primary income seems to be from subpar digital artwork, sold to sympathetic followers under the false pretense of keeping her afloat.

The most egregious part of her scam, however, is the fraudulent medical claims. She allegedly lied about having cancer, stating she miraculously went into remission after just three chemo treatments—a medical improbability that exposes the entire charade. She claims to have no support system, dismissing the very people offering her sound advice from their own life experiences as ""not understanding"" her. She even vilifies her homeless parents while apparently having the means to help them.

The pattern doesn't stop there. Her stories are consistently crafted to make her a victim while omitting crucial details:

· She claimed to be raped but provided only a fragment of the story, painting a man as ""creepy"" while leaving out her own role in the situation.
· She reported her car stolen but admitted to leaving her keys, purse, and all valuables inside it, then attacked anyone who questioned that decision as ""disrespectful.""

When she was finally called out on her inconsistencies and lies, her response was to deactivate her dog's Instagram account and play the victim yet again, claiming she has ""no real friends,"" despite abandoning the very community that supported her from the beginning.

This isn't about struggling with medical issues. This is about getting caught. You got caught in your grift, your con, your scam. So you’re running away to find new people to manipulate.

A word of warning: your lies have a lifespan. The photography community is tight-knit, and your false accusations of sexual assault will catch up to you, resulting in you being blacklisted entirely. You're about to find out. Good luck—you're going to need it.",1,1757466205.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

Her guitar had a peace sign painted on the face, and the outfit was impeccable from the fringed jacket to her bell bottoms. A Hollywood costumer could have put it together, or, more likely, she had gotten exceptionally lucky at a garage sale. The music matched, too; a little Carole King, a little Lennon, a few songs I suspected were original. I knew, as soon as she started to play, that she was playing for me.

The whole coffee shop knew it, too. I caught the glances of a few jealous men, even though I couldn’t tear my eyes from her. She was blue and blonde and strange, the best imitation of another time I had ever seen. I saw her, and she saw me, and it was clear that I would be the man to kill her dead. Her first death, she whispered to me later in my apartment, was 1968. She insisted on making love, said that it would be that much more salacious if she was murdered by a lover. I could see the logic.

Fame was all she ever wanted. It could be for music or for beauty or for the deplorable condition her moldering corpse showed up in, just so long as it made the headlines. Dumped into a California gulch and never again disturbed didn’t do it for her. I’ve killed her a hundred times. I love her. I hate her.

If it changes season and the crop dies, the deluxe speed-gro gets cooked. From Spring to Summer we use coffee beans and from Summer to Fall we use wheat seeds. We can also use fiber seeds all seasons. Let's say I do my last harvest of Starfruit on the last day of Summer and plant wheat to keep the tiles with the Deluxe Speed-Gro. What do we do on the first day of Fall? How do we remove the wheat to plant the pumpkins? It doesn't grow fully in one day, does it? It's not like we can go there with the scythe and harvest it. What about the coffee beans from Spring to Summer? How do we remove it? Thank you in advance.

1nd0kdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nd0kdg/the_parking_lot/,The Parking Lot,"I was reading Junji Ito when I wrote this. I was also on a coffee date with a girl at a strip mall where I some how went the opposite direction of the exit when we were leaving. The anxiety of so many bad dates and Ito served as inspiration for this story 



The Parking Lot



	On a mild spring morning a man took a woman on a coffee date at the local strip mall. When the cashier beckoned them forward, the man ejaculated their orders before allowing a proper greeting between parties.

	

	“I will have a Blue Raspberry Lotus®, sugar free, and the lady will have a chai tea, iced”

	

	The woman pointed her finger skyward, mouth opening to protest; but, the cashier in the middle of the transaction took no notice of her.



	“What were the sizes?” the cashier inquired.



	“Oh, sorry, um, like medium sizes, I guess,” the man replied. The woman let out a soft “Um” in hopes of breaking in edgewise. 



	“Okay, so a tall is 12 ounces, does that work?” the cashier needed the clarification. 



	“Yeah, okay” the man stuttered out, clearly unsure how much 12 ounces is and could not imagine a comparable item. 



	“Actually, I need that chai tea to be a chai latte, hot, please”  interjected the woman. The cashier remedied the order immediately. The size of the drink was not contested, thus the woman would still receive a tall drink. 



	When totaled, the amount owed was $27.95. The man insisted he would cover the cost. In the end the woman paid  for herself and was able to receive 12 points on her rewards card. The woman sipped her drink in comfort knowing this. The man sipped his drink bitterly, it was not sugar free. 



	The man and the woman sat at a table in the back corner of the coffee shop. The man looked into his drink as if it would reveal some great truth to him. The woman stared at her phone, much more interested in her group chat. The man looked at his watch, only five minutes had passed. His every awkward misstep made the minutes feel agonizing. The man struggled to make conversation, he felt a ball form in his bowels. It pushed up into his throat making it difficult to form words. It felt like a hot band cinched tightly on his head. The man thought his crown would pop like a cork, his every embarrassing memory revealed to the world, and he would die knowing he had ruined his date. He sat feeling the immense emotions anchor him to his chair and the intensity of the heat in him rise. 



	“Hey, I need to go,” the woman interrupted the man’s silent panic.



	“You haven't finished your drink” the man noted, snapping back to the moment.



	“That’s okay,” she declared. 



The man did not contest the woman. They exited the coffee shop, entered the man’s Ford Fiesta and attempted to leave the parking-lot.



	. . . 

  


	“Um, okay, I’ll go this way” stated the man. He turned right after backing out. The stores paraded next to them. The tableau was average, flocks of teenagers going form shop to shop; young parents pushing their strollers in the athleisure wear®. The man rolled his head to the right, looking towards the woman. The woman returned his gaze for a split moment to nod politely, lips pulled back in a straight smile, and within that split moment, they somehow returned to the spot they had just left. 



	“ Oh, um, weird” murmured the man, “Um, let’s try that again”



	“Yeah,” the woman replied dryly, nodding again. 



	The scene remained the same. Children ran about, elderly shambled along. This time the man and the woman did not exchange glances. The man’s site  stayed fixed ahead. However, they found themselves back at the coffee shop, again. 



	“Ha, ha, um okay” the man croaked, his face boiling, his lips tingled from numbness. His bowels balled up again and he thought he would choke. The woman folded her arms and sighed. The man pressed forward making the same turns as before, scanning desperately for an exit. However the scene did not break and the parade of stores continued on each side of them. Ultimately, they arrived at the beginning each time. It was an Ouroboros of mundane suburbia. In desperation, the man flipped a bitch to circle the opposite way.

	

	Suddenly, an unseen street appeared to their right. The man could see it curve out to the main road. 



	“Ah, here we go, sorry” the man said, looking at the woman for reassurance. The woman returned his gaze from the corner of her eye, made no comment, her mouth a flat line and her brow raised. Then, just as quickly as their  eyes met, the street was blocked by a Ford F-450® with dual back tires, an eight foot bed, and full size cab. The monstrous vehicle stopped short, and blasted its horn. The man looked through the windshield and spotted the driver. It was an average Ford F-450 driver, a horrible, fat faced, beer bellied, man with a scruffy beard in stained hi-vis clothing. While the Ford 450 driver laid on the horn, the man witnessed the driver scream “stupid bastard” with such force brown spittle shot from the driver’s  packed lip onto the driver’s chin and windshield. 



The man rolled back, shying away from confrontation. The Ford F-450® whipped to the left, and as it did so it revealed a one way street sign. This filled the man with dread. The man could not bring himself to use the street, despite the woman's protest. He was anxious he would have to face the wrath of another honking vehicle. They continued in the demented loop that was the parking lot. 



	. . .

	

	The man and the woman cycled through the parking-lot over and over. The strip mall now appearing to them as a macabre facade to an amusement park they wish to escape, the people now actors in a sick prank. 

	

Without warning the man and the woman found themselves at the ass end of a line. Ahead, a new exit. 12 cars were in front of them. The light was red. They continued to wait. Clearly, the first car was not making a right hand turn.

	The light turned green, the line sped forward, but just as quickly the light returned to red. Now, 10 cars were before them. 



A Jeep Grand Cherokee® crept up from behind. The man spotted in his rear view mirror a young female in the driver seat. The man could feel the female’s gaze behind her Loui Vitton® sunglasses. The man felt a fire at the back of his neck. The light remained red. Each passing second felt like an eternity. The man thought his skin would blister from the female’s gaze. The Jeep Grand Cherokee@ rolled closer, now only the grill of the Jeep Grand Cherokee® was visible in the rear window. The man’s car had no sun roof but he felt the gaze beam down over him. The man thought the roof might give way to the female's immense presence. The light wouldn’t turn green. 



The female honked! It filled the man’s ears, breaking his concentration. Why wouldn’t the light turn green? The female honked again! The woman shouted an expletive barely heard over the blair of the horn. The light turned green, the man lurched forward in anticipation, but the red brake lights of the car in front did not diminish, the horn did not cease.



	The man leaned heavily to the left to see what constipated his exit. The very first car yielded to allow cars from the left to go before it. The bastard! The Jeep Grand Cherokee® could be felt against the back bumper of the man’s car, the man could feel the resistance from the brake. The woman spouted more near inaudible expletives. All the lights were red!



	A parked car to the right pulled forward! Impulsively the man pulled into the spot. He had anticipated to follow the other car through the parking spaces, but he was met with more glaring red lights. Behind them, they saw the Jeep Grand Cherokee® speed forward and as if a clog had just come unstuck a torrent of cars passed behind the man’s car in a blur.  The roar of engines replaced the sound of the Jeep Grand Cherokee®’s horn. Then as the stampede finally passed the man looked ahead to the parked car. No lights were on, there was no driver.  The man backed out of the parking space. The exit was now blocked by construction. Orange signs and traffic cones guarded a torn up street and dismantled lights. They continued their drive through the parking-lot.



. . . 

	 



	The parking-lot did not cease. It cycled over and over giving no respite to the man and the woman. The man looked at the dashboard clock, only 30 minutes had passed for them.

	

“Hey, I need to go. So….” stated the woman. 



	The man began to sweat, lines of salty water streaked his brow and stung his eyes. He could barely withstand how awkward the situation had become. If not for the endless parking-lot, the awkwardness would drive him to madness. 



	“Uh, yeah, just a sec” replied the man. 



The woman was doomed to endure many more seconds of the parking-lot

. . . 



	 When rounding the corner for the nth time, the man spotted a new traffic circle up ahead. His heart thumped in his chest as he approached their escape. However, he felt the same choking sensation as before, because he knew he would have to be aggressive. They encroached upon the circle. Cars swarmed around the center like liquid in a blender. Cars weaved between lanes, weaving in and out seeming to jettison themselves to their desired paths. The man yielded at the sign, looking out at the zooming cars as if he stood at the  edge of a cliff. 



	“Okay, you can go now” the woman goaded.



	“Just a second,” the man stuttered. The man fixated on the swirling mass. 



	“Go, now” the woman insisted, raising her tone. 



	The woman noticed a Ford Mustang® roll up behind them in  the side mirror. The Ford Mustang revved, the mirror warned it was closer than it appeared.



	“Please, just go” the woman said.



	The Ford Mustang® revved harder, its brakes almost unable to contain the machine.



	The cars in the roundabout seemed like an impenetrable wall of cycloning steel. The Ford Mustang®’ revved and honked. The tinted windows clad the driver in mystery, making the machine a sentient beast on its own. The stud poised to charge, the front listing up as it revved furiously. 



	“Goddammit, go” the woman screamed as she witnessed the tires of the Ford Mustang® shoot plumes of smoke, and heard the roar of the engine as the car heaved forward. The Ford Mustang® charged. Just as quickly the woman was thrown back as the man dove into the maelstrom. 



The man held the wheel hard to the left as if racing NASCAR®. The man and the woman were stuck in the middle lane of three. The man noted the woman bracing herself with the “oh shit” handle and the center console. The man then noted a gap to the right, and threaded the needle. As the man merged a BMW® entered the fray and per usual the BMW failed to use its turn signal so the man had no warning as it forced the man to the innermost lane. This caused the man and woman to circle at a sickening pace. The man spied into the BMW® and saw a man with slicked back hair and Oakly® sunglasses. The BMW® driver had AirPods® snug in each ear, and could be seen mouthing the word “asshole” as he glared back at the man. 



	The man and the woman felt like the car was a discus in the hand of an Olympian primed to throw. The man’s foot was firmly pressed to the floor. Any slower, they would crash. In desperation to make their escape, the man listed his whole body to the right, the discus thrown, narrowly missing the front end of a Honda Civic®. A basic looking girl set down her Stanley® cup and raised her hand to finger the air with multiple offensive gestures. The man flew through the middle lane penetrating into the right outermost lane, cutting off a Subaru Impreza®. The flannel wearing driver miraculously did not honk the horn, merely threw their left hand up with a twist of their wrist while shaking their head. The man barreled towards the exit, but at the last moment before the man and woman could burst through to freedom, a Hummer H1® entered the flurry deflecting the man and the woman away from deliverance. The man swerved to avoid a head on collision, the car fishtailed, then spun out. The world blurred and when they finally stopped spinning, in the distance stood the coffee shop. The man and the woman looked out the back window, the roundabout was blocked by construction. Big orange signs stated “Do Not Enter”.  Not knowing what else to do, they continued to circle the parking-lot.



. . .

  


	Eventually the man stopped the car. The man stopped the car directly in front of the coffee shop. A little over an hour had passed for the man and the woman.



	“Hey, how about you head inside. I’ll find a parking spot” said the man. 



	Without protest the woman exited the Ford Fiesta and entered the coffee shop, followed soon by the man. In the same back corner sat the woman. The man went to the counter. The cashier greeted the man. The man greeted the cashier back, and ordered two drip coffees. The two drinks totaled to $12.65. The man received no reward points, because he had no rewards card. The man sat at the table with the woman. As before the woman stared at her phone. 



	“Hell of a day, huh” said the man.



	“My friend is here to pick me up,” said the woman.



	The woman stood from the chair while grabbing the coffee. The woman also grabbed cream and sugar before exiting the coffee shop. The man stood soon after and exited. Outside, the world did not seem any different. The man entered his car, he circled the parking-lot one final time. Ahead, the exit was clear of construction and cars. The man stopped at the traffic light. His heart skipped a beat. The light turned green. The man exited the parking-lot.

For example, saying “Pardon me” instead of “Sorry” or using full sentences and punctuation in texts. Sometimes people take it the wrong way, like the person is being sarcastic or cold, but they’re not.

Is it just because people are used to being super casual these days? Or does formality come off as distant in a social setting?

1nd0g9h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nd0g9h,"Long-time bad room haver, I'd like to change that for once","Hi guys. For context, I've had terrible room design in every single room I've lived in. I've done hours of research and simply NEVER get it right. I just moved into a new spot and finally want to get it right, but I've accepted that I cannot do that without outside help.

 Here's the goals with this room (if I'm hoping for too much let me know): 

1. 3 different areas: I'd like to have a section of the room where I sleep, a section for hanging out with friends (couch), and an area to do my work. Def doesn't have to be 1/3 all around (my desk can be a small space, I just don't want it to be crowded as I work hybrid)
2. I would like to add a TV and coffee table. So far I've just set up what I'd already bought - I'd like to buy a TV and coffee table for the hangout area. Can buy extra seating as well!
3. Ideally, I have a yoga-mats worth of room to do some yoga, or I have a piece of furniture that can move easily (couch would count) to push out of the way so that I can do some yoga

Honestly, sorry if this is a crazy post, I just am DESPERATE to finally feel like I have a good room setup - it's been plaguing me all my life. I've included the dimensions of the room as well as the current layout I have. I don't have a closet in the room if that matters. Please let me know if any other information would be helpful (or if I've included so much that it's become obnoxious)!!! I have no idea how to do this so would love the help

BONUSES:  
\- I have a bike I'd prefer stay in my room. I can mount it to the wall, either standing up (one wheel on ground, one wheel on wall) or flush against the wall (whole bike off ground like a talking fish mount thingy). I'd love a place to keep it but understand that's a literal pipe dream

\- I own two crashpads ([36""x48""x4"" foam blocks](https://organicclimbing.com/collections/crash-pads/products/simple-pad)) that I'd like to store in the room if possible. They can turn [into chairs](https://www.metoliusclimbing.com/crash-pad-couch.html) if necessary, or I can keep them closed behind something. Again, I'll find a place for them no matter what, but it'd be fun if we had something cool for them

My schools hosting a fundraiser for our Journalism, Media, and Newspaper classes. To support you can purchase various tea, candy, coffee, toffees, chocolates, brownies, fudge, and other desserts. I've tried some myself and they're pretty good- all the earnings go towards new equipment which we desperately need. Most of our current equipment is the cheapest stuff on Amazon.

Anyway, I'd really appreciate y'all's support. Thanks!
