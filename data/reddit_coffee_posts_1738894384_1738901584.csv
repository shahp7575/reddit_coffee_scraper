What is the best way to grow a brand? Marketing of course! The best marketing a meme token can make is through in real life connections like QR codes at a bulletin board or clothing. 

Well luckily for snake wif hat we have the merch to build our brand! Snake wif hats partnership with meme coin merch all proceeds go directly to the snake wif hat marketing wallet which will help us secure listings at CEXs and market the token even further. Help us grow the brand and grab a nice sweatshirt hat or mug (my personal favorite is the coffee mug as it’s affordable and has plenty of use at the office)

1ijmehy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ijmehy/my_sister_got_into_an_abusive_relationship_moved/,"My sister got into an abusive relationship, moved to a small town in Montana, and now has cut off my whole family. Please help","(This does have discussion about Domestic Abuse, there is a trigger warning at that specific spot. Names/places are changed for obvious reasons)

I’m 17M, and my sister, Kyla (30F), started her first serious relationship with a woman, Sarah (30F), six months ago. I was happy for her because she seemed genuinely happy. I’d only met Sarah a few times, she was a bit standoffish but nice.

The biggest change was that we barely saw Kyla anymore. She used to visit weekly, even during past relationships, but after meeting Sarah, she stopped coming around. No one in my family, except me, had even met Sarah until Christmas, five months into their relationship.

Our parents aren’t perfect, they have traditional views and have said homophobic and transphobic things before, but they try their hardest, love us, and correct themselves when we call them out. Before Sarah, Kyla always defended them when my other sister, Annie, and I vented. But after meeting Sarah, she started venting too, especially about our dad, calling him homophobic and misogynistic. She even planned to cut him off. Since I also felt hurt by their lack of acceptance (I’m trans, and my parents aren’t super supportive), I agreed with her.

Four months in, Kyla announced she was moving to a small town in Montana to live with Sarah in her parents’ house to save money. She quit her job, dropped out of uni (in her last year), and planned to leave after Christmas. We weren’t thrilled but congratulated her anyway. She reassured me that I could always come out to her and that she’d call me every weekend.

On Christmas, she finally introduced Sarah to our parents. My mom was emotional, but my dad barely spoke. Kyla also shared that Sarah had gifted her a trip to Puerto Rico right after their move. She seemed so excited, and I was happy for her.

When moving day came, she kept pushing up the date so they would leave sooner. My mom and I went to say goodbye, but she didn’t let us inside, saying the house was messy. We said our goodbyes in the car, and then she left. They moved their stuff in and immediately flew to Puerto Rico.

TRIGGER WARNING – Domestic Violence

The first night in Puerto Rico, my mom got a call at 2 AM (I was asleep, so this is secondhand info, but Kyla texted me the next day saying the same thing). She was hysterical, Sarah had thrown an engagement ring at her, then threw her things at her in the shower, shattering them. She screamed at Kyla, called her a ""psycho bitch,"" and tried to get hotel staff to kick her out. Before that, she shoved all of Kyla’s belongings into the hallway and tried to force her out too. Then Sarah disappeared for over 24 hours, leaving Kyla alone in Puerto Rico.

My mom started searching for flights while trying to calm Kyla down. Kyla kept saying she ""knew this would happen"" and claimed Sarah’s mom blamed her for not being more careful with her words. That’s when she finally told my mom that Sarah has BPD.

The next day, Kyla texted my mom, saying they were meeting at a coffee shop to talk. I’m not sure what was said, but afterward, Kyla insisted everything was resolved and that they were going sober.

I texted her (as did most of my family) to express concern. She reassured me she was fine and promised to call when she got back to Montana. She also kept my mom updated on their plans and daily activities in Puerto Rico. I texted her almost every day that week to check in.

(For context, I have three older sisters: Meghan (the oldest, living in Australia), Kyla (second oldest), and Annie (third). I’m the youngest.)

My parents asked Meghan to call Kyla, hoping an older sister checking in might help. Kyla and I were also supposed to call that day (spoiler: that never happened). According to Meghan, their conversation was light, and Kyla didn’t mention the fight.

But Kyla told a different story. After the call, she sent my mom a long text saying Meghan had told her that my parents were saying hurtful things about her. She accused them of being homophobic and called my mom a liar for saying Sarah hit her, along with a bunch of other things that didn’t make sense to me. She said she was done being the “glue” of the family and was cutting off both Mom and Dad. She said some really awful things, and my mom cried all day. I spent most of it trying to comfort her.

I was shocked she wanted to cut off Mom, but cutting off Dad made sense. What confused me most was that I sent Kyla a meme just to make her laugh, and got nothing. I’m pretty sure she’s cut off not just my parents but me and Annie too. So I guess all that talk about always being here for me and loving me was just bullshit lol.

Now, she’s talking to absolutely no one. She’s living in Montana at her abusive partner’s parents’ house, and I have no clue what to do. I love her, but I’m so hurt. Please give me some advice.

1ijmd84,https://www.reddit.com/r/consoles/comments/1ijmd84/new_interview_with_phil_spencer/,New Interview with Phil Spencer,"Phil Spencer answers the door in a hoodie and jeans. He shakes my hand, gives me a warm smile. ""Come on in,"" he says.

His house looks normal at first. A big TV, shelves of games, a few awards. Then I notice the consoles. Old consoles. Sega Genesis, Sega CD, and—everywhere—Sega 32X.

There’s one hooked up in the living room. Another stacked on a Genesis in the corner. A third, still in its box, sits on a bookshelf like a trophy. I count five before I stop. On the coffee table, a 32X is taken apart, its plastic casing cracked open, wires spilling out.

“I collect them,” Phil says, watching me. He gives a small chuckle. “They’re interesting, right?”

Then I see the Sega Saturn. Something is jammed into the RAM cartridge slot. I lean in. It takes me a second to understand what I’m looking at.

It’s another 32X.

“Does this even work?” I ask.

Phil rubs the back of his neck. “If you modify the—” He stops. His voice trails off.

I don’t press. I already feel uneasy.

Then I spot something else. Something tucked behind a chair, half-hidden under a wrinkled T-shirt. A white console. Sleek. Modern.

A PlayStation 5.

I glance at Phil. He’s frozen.

I lift the T-shirt. The PS5 is plugged in. The power light glows faintly. I press the eject button. A disc slides out. Demon’s Souls.

Phil’s face tightens. “That’s… not mine.”

“It’s warm,” I say.

His eyes flick to the console, then to me. “I just— I play it for research.” His voice is quiet now.

I wait. He doesn’t say anything else. He moves to the couch, motions for me to sit. He’s trying to reset the mood, but I can tell he’s rattled. I decide not to let him off the hook.

I take out my recorder.

Q: What happened to Xbox?

Spencer exhales. “What do you mean?”

Q: Xbox was dominant in the early 360 years. Then under your leadership, it slid into irrelevance. You lost exclusives, lost Japan, lost mindshare. At this point, Xbox feels like an afterthought. What happened?

He shifts in his seat. “I wouldn’t say it’s an afterthought. We’re growing. Game Pass is changing how people engage with gaming.”

Q: You’ve had Game Pass for years. It’s still not profitable. You’re conditioning people to see games as disposable. You’ve spent billions acquiring studios, and what do you have to show for it? Starfield? Redfall? Half-finished live-service slop?

Spencer flinches at Redfall. “I get the frustration. We didn’t deliver the consistency we need. But—”

Q: You didn’t deliver, period. Xbox Series X was supposed to be the most powerful console ever. But it has no must-play exclusives. Sony is running laps around you. Nintendo is selling 130 million Switches. You keep saying you ‘believe in console gaming,’ but you release all your games on PC. Do you even believe in Xbox?

Spencer leans forward, rubbing his hands together. “I believe in players. I believe in giving people choice.”

Q: ‘Choice’ is just PR-speak for not committing to anything. Like the 32X.

He forces a laugh. “You really don’t like the 32X, huh?”

Q: The 32X was a half-measure. It confused the market, divided resources, and ultimately helped kill Sega as a hardware maker. Sound familiar?

Silence.

Q: You used to talk about ‘console wars’ being bad for the industry. But competition is what drives innovation. Instead of fighting, you just gave up. Xbox has no identity. Game Pass is a crutch. Where does Xbox go from here?

Spencer sighs. He looks tired now. “We’re building something for the long term. It’s not about outselling PlayStation or Nintendo. It’s about making gaming more accessible.”

Q: You mean making Xbox a brand, not a platform. You’re laying the groundwork to kill the console. How long until you shut it down entirely?

His face darkens. “That’s not the plan.”

Q: But it’s where this ends, right? Xbox as a cloud service. Game Pass on PlayStation. No more hardware. No more identity. Just an app.

Spencer doesn’t answer.

The silence stretches.

Outside, the wind howls against the house. Somewhere in the corner, a Sega 32X blinks its red LED, still clinging to life.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

[The Shadows Knew Her Name - Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hnpw8f/the_shadows_knew_her_name/)

Part 1 – The Call to Silence

The office of The Liminal Society wasn’t much more than a cluttered spare room in the back of an old diner. A mix of dim light bulbs and a crooked poster reading, “Fear is just misplaced curiosity,” gave the room its only semblance of personality. TJ sat cross-legged on a folding chair, spinning a pen between his fingers as he scrolled through emails on their well-used laptop.

“Another haunted church,” TJ muttered. “Apparently, the pews move on their own. Or the priest just didn’t read the IKEA instructions.” He leaned back dramatically, nearly tipping the chair. “Shouldn't a priest be the one handing out eviction notices to ghosts?”

“Maybe people are scared of ghosts,” Mike replied from behind the counter, munching on a bag of chips. “Crazy, right? I mean, imagine being scared of spirits when you can just call two amateurs and a professor.”

TJ spun toward him, the pen flying from his hand. “First of all, rude. Second, amateurs? Did you see the views on the haunted barn case? We’re basically celebrities.”

Mike raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, nothing screams ‘celebrity’ like 300 YouTube subscribers and a comment saying, ‘Nice video, nerds.’”

Before TJ could retort, the familiar ping of an incoming email cut through the banter. The subject line read: “HELP. My Brother Is Missing. Still Cavern.”

The tone of the email was desperate. Anna Shaw described how her brother, Dr. Thomas Shaw, and his team of researchers had gone missing months ago while exploring a remote cave system in Oregon. She detailed her brother’s groundbreaking research into silence’s effects on the human mind, which had led him to investigate the cave after hearing rumors of its extraordinary stillness. She included chilling details: the team had gone silent after sending strange recordings, and no one had been able to locate them despite extensive searches.

Anna closed the email with a plea: “The authorities have given up. You’re my only hope.”

“Sounds like a job for us,” TJ said, clapping his hands together. “Missing scientists, creepy cave, unspeakable horrors—check, check, and check.”

Mike groaned. “I’m gonna stop you right there. ‘Unspeakable horrors’? We’re ghost hunters, TJ, not spelunkers. Caves are like nature’s murder basements.”

“Okay, fair,” TJ replied, holding up a hand. “But think about the content! A cave that’s so quiet it drives people mad? It’s like Silence of the Lambs meets The Descent. I’m getting goosebumps just thinking about the thumbnails.”

“Mike’s right to be cautious,” came a measured voice from the doorway. Professor Lewis, their academic backbone and the group’s unofficial dad, stepped into the room. His sharp gaze fell on the email as he adjusted his glasses. “Caves, especially ones with unique acoustic properties, often have... let’s say, unintended effects.”

TJ leaned forward, a grin spreading across his face. “Unintended effects, you say? Like portals to other dimensions?”

“More like disorientation and paranoia,” Lewis corrected, though he didn’t sound entirely convinced. He tapped the medallion on TJ’s desk, the strange artifact they’d uncovered in their previous case. It glowed faintly. “But if the medallion is reacting, we can’t ignore the possibility of something... greater.”

The room fell silent. The medallion’s faint pulse seemed louder in the stillness, as though it were drawing them in.

“So we’re doing this?” Mike asked, already dreading the answer.

TJ clapped him on the shoulder. “Pack your crowbar, buddy. We’re going spelunking.”

The team met Anna Shaw the next day at a small diner just outside of Portland. She was in her early thirties, her eyes tired but sharp with determination. She slid a folder across the table toward them.

“This is everything I could find,” she said, her voice wavering slightly. “Thomas was obsessed with silence—anechoic chambers, sensory deprivation tanks, you name it. He believed absolute silence could unlock something in the human mind. But then he heard about Still Cavern.”

TJ flipped through the folder, which contained photos of Dr. Shaw and his team, along with diagrams of advanced caving equipment and research notes. “So, your brother thought this cave was the ultimate white noise machine? Sounds relaxing.”

Anna’s eyes darkened. “He said it wasn’t just quiet—it was unnatural. He called it ‘silence that listens.’”

Mike leaned back, visibly uncomfortable. “That’s not ominous at all.”

Anna pulled out a small recording device and hit play. The audio began with faint static, then shifted into a low, haunting hum punctuated by whispered voices.

“It’s the last thing Thomas sent me before he disappeared,” she explained. “The whispers... they sound like him, but they’re distorted.”

TJ and Mike exchanged a glance. Even the ever-skeptical Lewis frowned as he studied the recording.

“Did anyone survive the expedition?” Lewis asked.

“One man,” Anna said. “A caver named Carter. He disappeared for weeks before stumbling back into town. But he’s... different now. He won’t talk about what happened.”

TJ raised an eyebrow. “Great, so we’re dealing with cave-induced possession. Anyone else wanna tap out, or is it just me?”

Mike sighed. “I’m going to regret this, aren’t I?”

“Definitely,” TJ said, standing up. “But think of the views!”

Still Cavern wasn’t on any official maps. The drive to its remote location took hours, with the dense Oregon forest growing darker and quieter as they neared the site. Even the usual forest sounds—birds, rustling leaves—faded into an eerie stillness.

“This is like the part of the movie where we ignore all the obvious signs to turn back,” Mike muttered, clutching his crowbar like a safety blanket. “Next thing you know, we’re the ones in the creepy found footage.”

“Relax,” TJ said, his tone breezy. “If anything happens, you’ll be the lovable sidekick. Everyone will cry when you die.”

“That’s... not comforting.”

They parked near the cavern entrance, a gaping maw of blackness surrounded by jagged cliffs. Abandoned caving gear littered the area, including ropes, helmets, and a scratched chalkboard with the words, “The silence knows you” scrawled across it.

Lewis knelt beside a discarded helmet, examining its broken light. “Something scared them enough to abandon their equipment.”

“Great,” Mike said, glancing at the dark entrance. “Anyone else hear ‘abandoned’ and think ‘we should leave’?”

TJ patted his shoulder. “Come on, Mike. Where’s your sense of adventure?”

“Buried somewhere safe, where it’s not gonna be eaten by cave demons.”

The medallion around TJ’s neck pulsed faintly, its glow illuminating the entrance. TJ’s expression turned serious for the first time. “We’re not leaving. Not yet.”

The silence hit them as soon as they stepped into the cave. It wasn’t just quiet—it was oppressive, muting even the faintest sound. Their breathing sounded distant, their footsteps muffled to a degree that defied logic.

“Is it just me, or is it too quiet?” Mike whispered, his voice barely audible even to himself.

“Probably just your imagination,” TJ replied, though his usual humor sounded forced. “Or, you know, the vengeful spirits of all the cavers who died here.”

Mike groaned. “You’re the worst.”

The team advanced cautiously, their flashlights casting long, distorted shadows on the jagged walls. The air grew colder the deeper they went, and strange markings began to appear on the walls—spirals, lines, and symbols eerily similar to those on the medallion.

“This cave wasn’t just formed by nature,” Lewis observed, running his hand over the carvings. “These markings are deliberate. Ritualistic.”

TJ squinted at a particularly large symbol. “Rituals in caves? What’s next, goat sacrifices? Because I draw the line at goats.”

The oppressive silence deepened as they reached a narrow passage. A faint, rhythmic tapping echoed from somewhere ahead.

“Please tell me that’s not what I think it is,” Mike whispered.

“It’s probably just a... friendly cave miner,” TJ replied, though his grin faltered. “Or maybe a skeleton trying to learn percussion.”

The tapping grew louder, accompanied by a low hum that vibrated through the walls. The medallion glowed brighter, its heat seeping into TJ’s chest.

“We’re close,” Lewis said, his tone grim. “Too close.”

The passage opened into a larger chamber, where the remnants of the scientists’ expedition lay scattered. Advanced caving equipment, cameras, and notebooks were abandoned haphazardly. A faint, acrid smell lingered in the air.

TJ picked up a notebook, flipping through pages of data and frantic scribbles. “Looks like they were tracking... heart rates, brain waves, and—oh, cool—‘signs of possession.’ Very casual.”

Mike nudged a camera with his foot, his unease growing. “Should we... look at the footage? Or should we run away screaming and hope for the best?”

“Option two’s tempting,” TJ admitted, but his curiosity won out.

They played the camera’s footage, which began with mundane observations. Dr. Shaw’s voice was calm, detailing the cave’s silence and its effects on the team. But the tone shifted as the recordings progressed—murmurs about shadows moving in the periphery, unseen forces pulling them deeper.

The final recording showed the scientists huddled around a glowing altar-like structure, their faces pale with fear. Shaw’s voice trembled: “The silence isn’t empty. It’s alive.”

The recording ended abruptly with screams and distorted static.

“Well,” TJ said, his voice breaking the silence. “Guess we won’t be asking for their Yelp review.”

The medallion pulsed again, its glow casting eerie patterns on the chamber walls. Faint whispers began to fill the air—soft, unintelligible, but unmistakably real.

“Did anyone else hear that?” Mike whispered, his grip tightening on his crowbar.

TJ forced a grin. “Nope. Definitely didn’t hear ghost whispers telling me to leave. Totally fine.”

But deep down, he wasn’t so sure. As the whispers grew louder, the oppressive silence of Still Cavern felt more alive than ever.

 

Still Cavern: Part 2 – The Silent Void

The silence of Still Cavern wasn’t just a lack of sound—it was an absence so profound it seemed to press against their thoughts, muting even the stray whispers of their minds. Every step TJ, Mike,

Anna, and Professor Lewis took felt amplified and yet swallowed whole, the faint crunch of their boots disappearing almost instantly into the void.

“This place is unreal,” Mike muttered, clutching his crowbar like it was a talisman. “It’s like we stepped into an episode of Nature’s Most Likely Murder Locations. I hate it.”

“Relax,” TJ replied, shining his flashlight ahead. “If anything jumps out, just scream. Oh wait—never mind, the silence will eat that too.”

Mike groaned. “You’re not making this better.”

Anna trailed behind, her flashlight trembling in her hand. “It’s more than just quiet,” she said, her voice barely audible. “It feels... wrong. Like the silence is listening.”

TJ, ever the comic relief, smirked. “Well, let’s hope it doesn’t leave a bad Yelp review.”

Professor Lewis paused, his light illuminating markings on the cavern wall. Strange spirals and angular lines stretched across the rock face, faintly glowing as if lit from within. He ran his hand over the etchings, his expression darkening. “These carvings aren’t natural. They were made intentionally.”

TJ squinted at the markings. “Great. We’ve got ancient doodles. Probably some prehistoric prank to scare future cavers.”

“They’re ritualistic,” Lewis replied, ignoring TJ’s levity. “And they’re old. Very old.”

Mike peered over Lewis’s shoulder, his unease growing. “Okay, so we’re officially in Creepy Caveman Church. Can we leave now?”

The passage opened into a large chamber scattered with the remnants of the scientists’ expedition. TJ’s flashlight caught glimpses of caving gear, abandoned supplies, and overturned recording equipment. A thin, acrid smell hung in the air, faint but sharp enough to make Anna wince.

“This looks... recent,” Anna said, kneeling by a torn backpack. She sifted through its contents, pulling out a water bottle, a crumpled notebook, and a weathered photograph of the research team. Her brother, Dr. Thomas Shaw, smiled back at her from the picture. “They didn’t leave here willingly.”

TJ picked up a notebook of his own, flipping through its pages. “Let’s see... boring scientific data, more boring scientific data... and bingo! Ominous scribbles.” He held up a page filled with erratic handwriting. “Here’s a good one: ‘The silence reveals truths we were never meant to know.’ Love that for us.”

Mike, poking at an overturned helmet with his crowbar, groaned. “Fantastic. So the cave whispers secrets, and they wrote them down. Anyone else want to vote for leaving before we turn into cryptic diary entries?”

Lewis examined a recording device lying amidst the wreckage. “This equipment is state-of-the-art. They weren’t amateurs.” He pressed a button, but the device crackled with static and then went silent. “Whatever happened, it disrupted their ability to communicate.”

“Or they got too busy running for their lives,” TJ suggested, lifting a granola bar from a nearby pack. “At least they had snacks.”

Anna glared at him. “Can you take this seriously for once?”

“Sorry,” TJ said, holding up the granola bar like a peace offering. “Serious mode activated.”

As the team ventured deeper, the silence became heavier, more oppressive. It wasn’t just quiet—it felt alive, like a presence pressing against their ears and minds. Anna shivered, pulling her jacket tighter around herself.

“It’s colder,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

“It’s not just the temperature,” Lewis replied. “This kind of silence—complete, absolute—affects the body and mind. It amplifies fear, distorts perception.”

Mike tightened his grip on his crowbar. “Distorted perception? Cool, love that. Just what we needed—cave-induced paranoia.”

As they moved forward, strange markings became more frequent, spiraling and crisscrossing the walls with eerie precision. The carvings seemed to glow faintly under the beam of their flashlights, as if the rock itself was alive.

“These symbols,” Lewis murmured, tracing one with his fingers. “They’re similar to ancient glyphs found in other ritual sites, but these... these are unique. They suggest this place wasn’t just explored—it was worshipped.”

TJ whistled softly. “Worshipped, huh? Let me guess: people brought offerings, prayed for good harvests, and then accidentally summoned something awful.”

Lewis didn’t respond, his focus locked on the carvings. Meanwhile, Anna stopped abruptly, her flashlight trembling in her hand.

“Did you hear that?” she whispered.

“Hear what?” Mike asked, scanning the passage behind them.

“Whispers,” Anna said, her voice shaking. “They said my name.”

The group exchanged uneasy glances. TJ forced a laugh, though it sounded hollow. “Cool, so the cave is a fan of yours. Maybe it wants an autograph.”

“It’s not funny,” Anna snapped, her tone breaking.

“Okay, okay,” TJ said, raising his hands in mock surrender. “Let’s not lose our heads—yet.”

The passage narrowed, the air growing colder with every step. Shadows flickered on the walls, though no one could tell where they originated. Even their flashlights, which had seemed so reliable, began to falter, their beams dimming and flickering erratically.

TJ slowed, a knot of unease forming in his stomach. “Is it just me, or are the shadows... moving?”

Mike spun around, his flashlight jerking across the walls. “Oh, no. No, no, no. Moving shadows? That’s a hard pass for me.”

Anna stopped in her tracks, clutching the photo of her brother tightly. “We’re close. I can feel it.”

Lewis looked over at her, his expression cautious. “Close to what?”

Before Anna could respond, a rhythmic tapping echoed through the cavern. It was faint at first, then grew louder, reverberating off the stone walls. It sounded almost human—like footsteps or knuckles rapping on rock.

“Okay, that’s not creepy at all,” TJ said, his tone strained. “Let’s just hope it’s... I don’t know, a cave rat. Or a very lost drummer.”

Mike glanced at him, his face pale. “What kind of rat knocks politely before murdering you?”

The tapping grew louder, accompanied by a low hum that vibrated through their chests. Anna’s flashlight beam caught movement ahead—something small and quick disappearing into the darkness.

“Did you see that?” she asked, her voice trembling.

TJ nodded slowly. “Yep. Definitely saw it. Probably just a really ambitious shadow. Nothing to worry about.”

The group pressed on, their footsteps careful and deliberate. The hum grew louder, morphing into something deeper, more guttural. The shadows on the walls began to stretch and twist unnaturally, as if alive.

The passage opened into a massive chamber, and the sight before them made Anna gasp. The remains of the scientists’ expedition were scattered across the chamber floor. Backpacks, ropes, and equipment lay in disarray, as though abandoned in panic. But it was the bodies that drew their attention.

“They’re... arranged,” Anna said, her voice breaking.

The bodies were positioned in a circle, their arms outstretched and hands clasped together. Some appeared mummified, their skin drawn tight over their bones, while others looked disturbingly fresh, their faces frozen in expressions of terror.

Lewis approached cautiously, his flashlight sweeping over the grim tableau. “This was no accident. This is ritualistic.”

Anna dropped to her knees, tears streaming down her face. “Thomas... he’s not here.”

TJ crouched beside her, his usual humor absent. “If he’s not here, it means he might still be alive. We just have to keep looking.”

A faint voice echoed through the chamber, soft and distorted. “Help us...”

Anna’s head shot up. “That’s him!” she cried, scrambling to her feet. “Thomas!”

“Wait!” Lewis called, grabbing her arm. “We don’t know what’s out there.”

“We can’t leave him!” she shouted, her desperation palpable.

TJ stood, his flashlight shaking slightly. “I’m with Anna. We didn’t come all this way to turn back now.”

Mike groaned, his grip tightening on his crowbar. “This is how people die in horror movies, you know that, right? Someone hears a spooky voice and thinks, ‘Let’s check it out!’”

Despite his protests, the team pressed forward. The chamber’s oppressive silence seemed to grow heavier, amplifying the sound of their footsteps and the faint whispers that trailed them.

As they moved deeper, the whispers grew louder, forming incomprehensible words that danced on the edge of their understanding. The shadows on the walls stretched toward them, their shapes becoming darker and more defined.

In the distance, the voice called again: “Help us...”

The group stopped, their flashlights converging on a distant figure. It was crouched against the far wall, its body shrouded in shadow.

Anna took a step forward, her voice trembling. “Thomas?”

The figure turned slowly, its movements jerky and unnatural. As it stepped into the light, the team recoiled. It was human—or had been once—but its eyes were pitch black, and its skin was pale and sunken. It opened its mouth, but no sound emerged.

“Okay, nope!” Mike shouted, backing away. “We’re done here. Let’s go. Right now.”

The figure tilted its head, its dark eyes locking onto TJ. A faint, guttural sound escaped its throat, like a distorted whisper.

“Help us...” it rasped, its voice blending with the whispers around them.

Anna stepped forward, tears streaming down her face. “Thomas, is that you?”

“Anna, stop!” Lewis shouted, pulling her back.

The figure took a shuddering step toward them, its movements sharp and erratic. The whispers grew louder, filling the chamber with an oppressive hum. The shadows on the walls seemed to converge, stretching toward the team like dark tendrils.

TJ raised his flashlight, his voice shaky. “I think we just found the silence’s customer service representative. And, uh... I’d like a refund.”

The figure stopped abruptly, its head jerking toward the center of the chamber. A faint glow emanated from the floor, illuminating an intricate pattern of symbols carved into the rock.

Lewis’s eyes widened. “This... this is a ritual site.”

As the glow intensified, the shadows closed in around the team, their edges sharp and menacing. The whispers became a cacophony, their words blending into an incomprehensible roar.

TJ tightened his grip on Anna’s arm, pulling her back toward the entrance. “We need to move. Now.”

“But Thomas—” Anna began, her voice breaking.

“We’ll find him,” TJ promised, his tone firm. “But we can’t help him if we’re dead.”

The team retreated, the shadows pressing closer with every step. The oppressive silence seemed to pulsate, filling their ears and minds with an overwhelming weight. As they stumbled back into the passage, the whispers faded, replaced by the echo of their ragged breaths.

For now, the silence had let them go. But TJ knew it was far from over.

 

Still Cavern: Part 3 – The Ritual of Silence

The oppressive atmosphere of Still Cavern seemed to deepen as the group moved through the winding tunnels, the silence now accompanied by faint vibrations underfoot. Every step felt amplified yet hollow, each breath swallowed by the void. Shadows danced unnaturally on the walls, stretching and twisting like living things.

TJ adjusted his flashlight beam nervously. “I know I’ve said this before, but this cave? Not a fan. Negative Yelp review incoming.”

Mike, gripping his crowbar with both hands, tried to summon his usual humor but couldn’t mask the quiver in his voice. “I mean, I’m pretty sure this place was designed by someone who actively hates humans. Probably also eats them.”

Anna, her flashlight steady despite her trembling hands, shot them a glance. “Thomas is close—I can feel it. We can’t turn back now.”

Professor Lewis’s furrowed brow deepened as he scanned the glowing symbols etched into the walls. “We need to be cautious. This silence isn’t just a physical absence—it’s alive, and it’s feeding off us.”

TJ scoffed nervously, trying to shake the growing unease. “Great. So we’re snacks. Should we just dip ourselves in ranch dressing and call it a day?”

The group pressed forward, the silence growing heavier, their movements feeling sluggish as though the air itself resisted them.

The cave opened into a vast chamber, illuminated by an eerie, faint glow emanating from the floor. At the center stood a stone altar covered in intricate carvings that pulsed rhythmically, as if alive. Scattered around the room were remnants of the scientists’ expedition—backpacks, recording equipment, and overturned lamps—alongside ominous dark stains smeared across the rock.

Anna’s flashlight landed on a figure slumped against the far wall. “Thomas!” she cried, running forward before anyone could stop her.

“Wait!” Lewis shouted, but his voice was muffled, barely carrying in the oppressive silence.

As Anna knelt by the figure, her hands trembling, the man stirred. His gaunt, pale face was familiar, but his eyes—black as voids—locked onto her with a terrifying intensity. His lips moved, but no sound emerged.

“Thomas,” Anna whispered, tears streaming down her face. “It’s me. I’m here.”

The man’s body jerked unnaturally, his head snapping to the side before his lips finally parted. A guttural sound escaped him, layered and distorted, as though several voices spoke at once. “Too late,” he rasped, his voice hollow and inhuman. “The silence has taken me.”

Anna recoiled as Thomas convulsed violently, his limbs twisting at grotesque angles. The faint glow from the altar intensified, casting long shadows across the chamber.

“Step back!” Lewis shouted, pulling Anna away just as Thomas lunged toward her. His movements were erratic, almost insect-like, as he dragged himself toward the altar.

“Okay, that’s enough nightmare fuel for one day,” TJ muttered, stepping in front of Anna with his flashlight raised. “Can we vote to leave now?”

Thomas collapsed before the altar, his body convulsing as shadows coalesced around him. The carvings on the stone flared brighter, and the shadows began to take form—elongated humanoid shapes with glowing eyes, their edges flickering like static.

Mike backed up, his crowbar raised defensively. “Nope. Big nope. I don’t do shadow people.”

The first shadow lunged, its movements fluid and unnaturally fast. TJ swung his flashlight at it instinctively, the beam cutting through the darkness but offering no real protection. “It’s official,” he said, his voice cracking. “I’m gonna start carrying a flamethrower.”

Lewis scrambled to retrieve a pouch from his bag, scattering its contents—salt and ash—on the ground between the group and the advancing shadows. The mixture flared faintly, forming a temporary barrier.

“These shadows aren’t just entities,” Lewis said, his tone grave. “They’re extensions of the silence itself. And they’re not going to let us leave.”

Anna stared at Thomas, who had risen to his feet, his body twitching unnaturally. He turned to face the group, his blackened eyes glinting with malice. “The silence is alive,” he said, his voice a chilling blend of his own and something far darker. “And it’s hungry.”

Lewis’s gaze shifted to the altar, his eyes scanning the glowing carvings. “This altar—it’s a gateway. A ritual site meant to tether this realm to... something else.”

“Something else?” TJ echoed, his flashlight shaking. “Can you be less vague, or is ‘something else’ just code for ‘we’re all screwed’?”

Lewis ignored him, stepping closer to the altar. “The markings... there’s a way to seal it, but it requires a conduit. Someone to channel the energy and redirect it.”

Anna grabbed his arm. “Then do it. Close the gateway.”

Lewis hesitated, his expression dark. “It’s not that simple. The conduit wouldn’t survive. And if we fail... it could open the gateway fully.”

TJ froze, the weight of Lewis’s words sinking in. “So, just to clarify, we either try this and maybe die, or we definitely die later. Love these options.”

The shadows pressed closer, their glowing eyes fixed on the group. Thomas stood motionless near the altar, his body convulsing intermittently as if caught between two worlds.

“We don’t have time to debate!” Anna shouted, her voice breaking. “We have to do something!”

“I’ll do it,” TJ said suddenly, stepping forward. His voice wavered, but his expression was resolute. “If it means closing this thing, I’ll do it. But if I survive, you all owe me pancakes.”

“Absolutely not,” Mike protested, gripping his crowbar. “We’ll find another way.”

“There is no other way,” Lewis said quietly, his tone heavy. “This is the only chance we have.”

TJ approached the altar, his hands trembling as he placed them on its surface. The carvings flared brighter, and the room trembled as the shadows recoiled briefly, their shapes twisting in anger.

The altar’s glow pulsed rhythmically, and TJ felt a surge of energy coursing through him, his body locking up as the force overwhelmed him. The shadows screamed silently, their distorted forms lashing out but unable to reach him.

Lewis began chanting in a language none of them recognized, his voice barely audible in the oppressive silence. The carvings on the altar flared brighter, casting blinding light across the chamber.

Thomas let out a guttural roar, his body twisting violently as the altar’s energy intensified. The shadows converged on him, their forms engulfing him completely. His voice—distorted and layered—echoed through the chamber one last time. “You cannot silence the silence.”

With a final, ear-shattering scream, Thomas and the shadows were pulled into the altar, which flared with brilliant light before the carvings dimmed. The chamber trembled violently, cracks spreading through the walls as the gateway began to collapse.

“Get him up!” Lewis shouted, grabbing TJ as his body went limp against the altar.

Mike and Anna helped pull TJ to his feet, his face pale and his breathing ragged. “Did we... win?” TJ croaked, his voice weak.

The chamber shook violently, chunks of rock falling from the ceiling. “We need to move!” Lewis shouted.

The group scrambled back through the passage, the collapsing cavern threatening to swallow them whole. As they emerged into the cold night air, the ground behind them caved in, sealing the cavern’s entrance in a thunderous collapse.

TJ sank to his knees, his body trembling. “Okay,” he said weakly, his humor returning despite the fear in his voice. “Next time, I vote for haunted libraries. Or maybe a nice suburban poltergeist. You know, something friendly.”

Mike leaned against a tree, his crowbar still in hand. “I’m never going in a cave again. Ever.”

Anna stared at the collapsed entrance, tears streaming down her face. “He’s gone,” she whispered. “Thomas is gone.”

Lewis placed a hand on her shoulder, his expression somber. “We stopped the gateway. But this isn’t over.”

TJ glanced at him, his exhaustion giving way to unease. “What do you mean?”

Lewis looked toward the collapsed cavern, his eyes narrowing. “This was just one gateway. There are others.”

As the group stood in the cold, silent forest, the faint sound of whispers drifted through the air, a chilling reminder that the silence wasn’t gone—it was only waiting.

 

Still Cavern: Part 4 – Shadows in the Distance

The aftermath of the cavern’s collapse weighed heavily on the group. They stood just beyond the pile of rock and earth that had once been the gateway, their breaths visible in the frigid night air. The silence that had oppressed them within the cavern seemed to linger, as if refusing to release its grip entirely.

TJ leaned against a tree, clutching his ribs. His face was pale, his usually sharp wit dulled by exhaustion. “Well,” he said, his voice cracking. “I think we can all agree caves are officially canceled. Forever.”

Mike sat on a nearby boulder, his crowbar resting across his knees. “You’re telling me,” he muttered. “This whole trip has been a masterclass in how to hate underground spaces.”

Professor Lewis stood a few feet away, his flashlight trained on the collapsed entrance. He studied the site intently, his brow furrowed. “The gateway is sealed,” he said softly, more to himself than the others. “But something tells me this silence is far from contained.”

Anna, seated on the ground with her knees drawn to her chest, stared at the collapsed entrance. Her hands trembled as she clutched the photograph of her brother. “He’s gone,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “I came here to save him, but I couldn’t.”

TJ pushed himself upright, hobbling over to her. “Hey,” he said, kneeling beside her. “You did everything you could. This place... it was designed to win. But we stopped it, Anna. Whatever it was trying to do, we stopped it.”

Anna shook her head, tears streaking her cheeks. “Then why doesn’t it feel like we did?”

The group returned to the motel under the cover of darkness. The atmosphere in the small room was tense, the air heavy with unspoken thoughts. TJ collapsed onto the nearest bed with a groan, pressing a cold compress to his forehead. “Alright, new rule,” he said, his voice muffled. “Next time, we go after something friendly. A haunted bakery. A ghost dog. Anything that doesn’t involve nearly getting eaten by shadow people.”

Mike sat at the small dining table, scrolling through the footage on their equipment. “We don’t even know what half this stuff is,” he muttered. “Shadows, whispers, weird glowing symbols—it’s like a paranormal grab bag of terrible ideas.”

Lewis, seated in the corner with the medallion in hand, studied its surface intently. The artifact seemed dimmer than before, its glow reduced to a faint pulse. “Whatever we encountered in that cavern,” he began, “it was ancient. Intelligent. And deeply connected to the medallion.”

TJ turned his head to face him. “So, what? The medallion’s like an all-access pass to interdimensional horror? Because I’d really like to cancel my membership.”

Lewis didn’t look up. “The medallion is both a key and a seal. It draws us to these places because it is tied to them. And I fear that with each gateway we encounter, its influence over you grows stronger.”

TJ sat up, wincing. “Fantastic. So now it’s not just the shadows we have to worry about, it’s this little guy.” He gestured toward the medallion. “This just keeps getting better.”

Anna, who had been silent since their return, finally spoke. “If the medallion is tied to these gateways, does that mean there are more of them?”

Lewis nodded grimly. “It’s likely. Still Cavern was only one node in a larger network. These gateways are connected, and the entities that inhabit them are bound by similar forces.”

“Great,” Mike said, leaning back in his chair. “So we just shut them all down, right? Easy-peasy. No big deal.”

TJ let out a weak laugh. “Yeah, Mike, because shutting down one almost didn’t kill us. Let’s just make it a world tour.”

The next morning, Lewis continued his study of the medallion while the others tried to recover. He spread out a collection of books and notes across the motel’s table, cross-referencing ancient texts and his own research. The symbols on the medallion seemed to shift under the light, their meanings elusive.

“This isn’t just a seal,” Lewis muttered, his voice low. “It’s a map.”

Mike, sitting nearby with a cup of coffee, raised an eyebrow. “A map to what? The world’s worst vacation spots?”

“To other gateways,” Lewis replied. He pointed to a faintly glowing symbol near the edge of the medallion. “These markings correspond to locations. Still Cavern was one. But there are others.”

Anna leaned over the table, her eyes scanning the medallion. “So, if we follow these... we can find the other gateways?”

“And stop them,” Lewis said. “If we don’t, the entities on the other side may find ways to slip through.”

TJ, lying on the bed with an arm draped over his eyes, groaned. “You’re telling me we have to do this all over again? I just got the cave dust out of my hair.”

Mike smirked. “Look on the bright side, TJ. Maybe the next one will have less whispering and more... I don’t know, sunshine.”

TJ lifted his arm to glare at him. “I’m holding you to that, Mike. If the next place isn’t haunted by tropical cocktails, I’m blaming you.”

As the group prepared to leave the motel, Anna received a message on her phone. She read it aloud, her voice tinged with curiosity. “It’s from someone named Carter,” she said. “The caver who survived Still Cavern.”

TJ sat up immediately. “Wait, the guy who went all cave-zombie and disappeared? What’s he want?”

Anna scrolled through the message. “He says he knows about the gateways. And he wants to meet.”

Lewis frowned. “If he survived Still Cavern, he may have insights we don’t. But we’ll need to proceed cautiously. His experience could have left him... compromised.”

“Compromised how?” Mike asked, his voice wary. “Like he’s secretly a shadow person? Because I’m not signing up for that.”

“We won’t know until we meet him,” Lewis said. He turned to Anna. “Did he say where?”

Anna nodded. “An old observatory near the coast. He says it’s safe.”

“Safe,” TJ echoed, his tone dripping with sarcasm. “Right. Because nothing says ‘trustworthy’ like an abandoned observatory.”

Despite their reservations, the group packed their equipment and hit the road. The medallion, still faintly glowing, hung from TJ’s neck like a constant reminder of their mission.

As they drove through the dense forest, the atmosphere grew heavier. The sunlight filtering through the trees seemed dimmer, and an unnatural stillness settled over the landscape.

“This feels familiar,” Mike muttered, glancing out the window. “Too familiar. Like we’re driving straight into another death trap.”

“Relax,” TJ said, though his grip on the steering wheel tightened. “It’s probably just... atmospheric. You know, spooky vibes. Very on-brand for us.”

Anna sat in the backseat, staring at the medallion. “Do you ever feel like it’s watching you?” she asked suddenly.

TJ glanced at her in the rearview mirror. “The medallion? All the time. It’s like having a clingy ex—never gives you a moment’s peace.”

Lewis turned from the passenger seat. “Its connection to you is deepening, TJ. You must remain vigilant. The medallion’s influence is subtle, but it could sway your decisions without you realizing it.”

“Awesome,” TJ said, his tone sardonic. “So now I’m not just the guy with a haunted necklace, I’m the guy with a manipulative haunted necklace. Love that for me.”

As the car rounded a bend, the old observatory came into view. The structure loomed against the gray sky, its dome cracked and rusted. Vines crept up its walls, and broken windows stared out like hollow eyes.

“This... looks inviting,” Mike said, his voice tinged with unease.

The group exited the car and approached the building cautiously. The silence around them felt suffocating, as though the forest itself were holding its breath.

“Anyone else getting déjà vu?” TJ asked, his flashlight cutting through the gloom. “Because I’m pretty sure we’ve been here in every nightmare I’ve ever had.”

As they stepped inside, the door creaked loudly before slamming shut behind them. The sharp sound reverberated through the empty halls, breaking the oppressive silence.

“That’s not ominous at all,” Mike said, gripping his crowbar tightly.

The group moved deeper into the observatory, their flashlights revealing dust-covered equipment and shattered glass. The air felt heavy, charged with an unseen energy.

At the center of the main chamber, a figure stood in the shadows. Carter. His gaunt frame and hollow eyes made him almost unrecognizable, but his voice was steady as he spoke.

“You found me,” he said, his tone flat. “Good. Because they’re coming.”

The room plunged into darkness, and the sound of whispers rose around them, growing louder and more insistent. The silence wasn’t gone—it was spreading.",0,1738900770.0,nosleep,1,0.5,False

The things I miss the most

feeling cozy in bed
feeling rested and energized
having all memories and feeling connected to life.
having specific memories and feelings for Halloween, summer, the beggining of spring, my birthday, etc - every day feels the same and devoid of all feelings and connections to what's happening. Doesn't matter if it's July or November, it feels no different to me
looking forward fo things; travel, dates, trying new things, accomplishing something new, even cleaning gave me such satisfaction. No feeling for any of it now
resting and waking up feeling better, again no matter how much I sleep or rest, I am still exhausted
going to bed and sleeping through the night with no nightmares
have a strong connection to my sense of self and feeling like me. I didn't know what a devoid sense of self was until this. I can't even remember who or what I used to feel like.
wanting to do fun things - I quite literally just work and sleep. Work helps me pass the time and keep my mind from focusing on this, and sleep is just a break from the physical pain. Otherwise I've stopped doing things on the weekends because why? There's no feelings.
enjoying sex. No sensation anymore
having feelings for someone, a crush, a date. No care anymore
having a sense of time, feeling time pass, feeling a part of the world around me. Im cut off from all of it now, I don't feel time pass or that there's a whole world around me
going out and dancing with friends. Just living in the moment and feeling happy. Actually enjoying myself and not pretending
not having physical pain. I'm a fit and lean guy, I've never had physical pain or chronic fatigue like I do now
enjoy simple moments of being grounded - morning coffee, the quiet before the day started, reading a book, meditating, etc. I could slow down and be in my life and body.
feeling alive and real. I had a strong connection to my emotions and the world. Now it's like I'm dead.
loving and connecting with nature. I used to take my dog out to the beach, hikes. I loved travel and seeing new things, I had these feelings for each city I went to, and I never felt unreal or unsafe. It's hard to describe how unreal I feel.
having connection to others, loving my friends, family and colleagues. There's no connection to anyone, even my dog.

Around over a year ago i started suffering from really bad dissociation after a bad experience with weed and i am afraid i will never be the same. I used to get high almost everyday and i was able to handle it but it wasn’t until december of 2023 that i bought a cart that i guess wasnt entirely real and it really messed me up. I threw it out almost immediately but the damage was done. i would try to get back into weed and smoke actual bud but i was never the same, everytime i would get high it would lead to month long dissociation periods. I have since been sober but the feeling hasn’t gone away. anything that makes me feel slightly different freaks me out. i can’t drink coffee or take certain medicines anymore and sometimes even just the feeling of being cold sends me over the edge. I’m afraid i’ve messed myself up forever. my friends try to encourage me at least just to get drunk again and i really want to but im afraid i will freak out. This has been driving me insane for the past year and i really don’t know what to do anymore. it’s not even about wanting to get high or drunk again , i just want to be normal but i feel a sense of impending doom all the time. the littlest things fuck me up and i can’t keep living like this i don’t  know what to do anymore.

1ijm0rq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ijm0rq,Old Machine Craft AIWB Belt,"So a week or so ago, I came across a post here in the sub from user coffeeandlifting2 about a belt design he came up with. Intrigued, I commented that I would buy one.

I received a direct message from coffee stating that he had 5 and had made a shop on Etsy if I was interested. So I picked one up and it arrived earlier today, so I’m here to give you my first impressions.

Over the last 10+ years I have only worn leather belts from  thebeltman.net, and my American Operator Gear. 

I believe the angle does legitimately help. This is the first time that the gun truly disappears for me when concealing, even when moving my shirt around purposely trying to make it print. 

The caveat to this, is I still have my pillow on my holster, and I set the belt up at the same level of tightness as American Operator Gear belt that is similar to the HC.  While the concealment is easily the best I have had, I did have more discomfort after the 3 hours I have worn it than I do with the AOG. Tomorrow I am going to loosen it a bit to see if that changes the comfort level or the concealment. 

From a quality standpoint, I am no expert. I would say the stitching is a little cleaner on my other belts, but the stitching looks more robust on the Old Machine Craft. This also has a different style buckle than I wear, but caused no comfort issues, is easy to cinch, and didn’t loosen at all over time. The thicker part of the belt is slightly more flexible than the AOG, though both are more flexible than my beltmans and neither tip like it does. 

If you have any questions, or want me to photograph any part of the belt, lemme know! I’ll update if further wear changes my opinions. 

Shout out to coffee for making it available for me to purchase and try out, and with his blessing I am adding the web address for anyone who wants to check it out.

How do I process it?,"Girl was very enthused, we planned a date, then she happened to get a migraine the morning of and I haven't heard back in a week. It was really sad because we talked a while, and she would be all interested in calls and would text me even sometimes. She would talk on the phone for two hours sometimes. Liked the same books, music, worked at the same places, same politics, life goals. She said things I said were cute or sweet, sent me pictures of pets and memories. I don't know if this is a week-long migraine or if she's gently telling me to fuck off. I sent her a get well text after she canceled and then a few days later a ""how are you , no pressure to reply"" text. Nothing.  I might send a last text Sunday, but Idk. 

I've literally been ghosted so many fucking times, I have a date with a ghost from a year and a half ago on Saturday. We matched on Hinge in 2023, she just stopped responding, and now in 2025 we matched again and planned a coffee date lmfao. I've literally been ghosted so many times, they're circling back around. I walked past a ghost about a month ago. She stared me down and I nodded my head once and smiled and walked past. On a second date last month, I bought another girl a nice dinner, and she was so enthusiastic she talked for a couple hours almost nonstop, enough for a waiter to look over lol. She literally mentioned her pornographic novels in a restaurant lol. Ghosted next day, as if I was the weird one.  Another girl kept canceling dates because she was ""testing me,"" and then she would text me periodically and tell me how I need to improve months later. I keep getting ghosted, lied to, manipulated. One ghost even had a boyfriend already as I found out. 

I truly cannot understand this, and it really, really hurts. In therapy today, which I'm not even sure is worth it, he said my low self-esteem causes me to become attached easy, so that's why I feel this stuff more. I know I have a lot to work on, as you could probably see by my posting history, but a lot of that is me blowing off steam. I'm a pretty normal guy who works in a government office, independent, fit but short statured and skinny, quiet, wears glasses. I hear from people I'm quiet and friendly.

1ijm060,https://www.reddit.com/r/latebloomerlesbians/comments/1ijm060/so_glad_i_found_this_subreddit/,so glad I found this subreddit,"Hey, y’all! :) My friend told me to check out this subreddit and holy crap, I can’t believe how many women are going through the same thing as me. I thought I was completely alone until I read your stories and I wanted to share mine. 

I suspect I’ve had crushes on girls my entire life but I didn’t realize it until I was 14. My family belongs to an offshoot of a very strict, authoritative, Christian doomsday cult so to say I was raised in a homophobic environment is an understatement. When I was 14, I was outed to my parents. I’ve never been that terrified in my life. 

My dad took it okay-ish, he said he didn’t support my choice but I was his daughter & he’d always love me & be there for me. My mom said she didn’t know who I was anymore and that she didn’t know how to love me now that she knew I liked girls. (So like, not the best reaction.) 

I attended christian counseling sessions (read: conversion therapy) for a couple months until I couldn’t take how broken my family was anymore. I told my mom that I had been confused and it was just a phase and I had realized that being with girls wasn’t something I actually wanted. She was so happy to hear that. I didn’t have to go to the counseling sessions anymore, my family felt functional again, and all I had to do was just, not be gay.

When I turned 18, I felt like it was safer to be myself, so I started embracing that side of myself. I came out to my best friends, who took it well. I believed I was completely gay & I was okay with that. 

Then I became obsessed with my guy best friend, Jack. We exchanged playlists & I’d listen to his music all the time & think about hanging out with him. We talked on the phone all night & sent each other good morning texts. We told each other everything. 

He told me he was interested in a girl who worked at his local coffee shop and I realized that it actually kinda bothered me. I was jealous. I thought about him 24/7 & I wanted him all to myself. I thought, okay, maybe I’m not gay, maybe I have a crush on Jack. We started dating and it was awesome. He is seriously my best friend, we had so much fun doing everything together. 

When it came time to actually start being intimate, I was so uncomfortable, but remember, I grew up in purity culture. We weren’t married so I figured the emotional discomfort was just religious guilt. And I liked him so much as a person. I thought he was so cute and he made me so happy, I had to be into him, right? 

The first time we kissed, I told him I didn’t like it very much? And he got so sad, which is fair. I liked it better the more it happened though because I got used to it, so I figured I really liked it. But the truth is, I didn’t like being intimate with him. I liked him. So much. But actually kissing, actually being touched by him in a sexual way, filled me with dread and I didn’t understand it. 

I liked cuddling with him and being kissed in a friendly way (forehead kisses, kisses on the cheek) and hugging him. Anytime I didn’t like something he wanted to do, my instinct was to push the feeling down because I loved him and wanted to make him happy. Even if I didn’t want to do something, I wanted to want to. 

I love my best friends platonically just as much as I love him, and he doesn’t understand that. He believes romantic relationships top everything else. He’s very opinionated & I think he’s really smart so when we disagree, I doubt myself sometimes. 

Well, we dated for a few years. I remember once when we were intimate, just staring at the ceiling and wondering when I was going to start genuinely enjoying it. I wanted to know when it (being with him) was going to feel better. I felt so guilty for not wanting it. I felt like a bad girlfriend.

When he proposed, I said yes, then panicked three weeks before the wedding and almost called it off. I told him in tears that I didn’t feel like I could marry him because I was gay. He told me he felt like he couldn’t breathe, then talked me through it. I’ve had a lot of anxiety and pure o ocd intrusive thoughts, so he believed that this was part of it. And what he said made sense - he asked if I love him, and I said yes of course. 

He asked me if I was attracted to him at all, and I thought about it. And I could get through being intimate with him, he was pretty good at it, and I wanted to make him happy. I thought that was enough so I said yes. 

We got married, and I hate to admit this, but I told myself that I could always leave if I needed to and that gave me the breathing space to do it. I love him so much, and being married to him has been so much fun. I love living with him and hanging out with him. He’s a great cook, he makes me laugh, he makes me feel loved. He’s my sunshine.

When I told him I had a crush on him all those years ago, I felt like I was making a promise to him, and I feel like I can’t change my mind because he’s so wonderful. But the sexual attraction and desire has always been missing for me. I don’t want to disappoint him so I’ve been trying so hard, for years, to want him the way he wants me to want him. But I feel like I’m so bad at it. 

He genuinely is my best friend and I love him with all my heart. He’s my favorite person. We have a fantastic relationship in every area of our lives except for this one thing lol. 

I feel like I’ve been selfish all these years by not being honest with him, but I wanted to be a good girlfriend. And I felt like it would be wrong to break up with him so I could be with a girl, after everything he’s done for me. I don’t want to lose him. 

But when I think about being with girls, I feel...incredibly light and excited? I feel so happy that I could float right off of the planet. I’m struggling with the idea that it’s okay for me to like girls and even okay for me to someday be with one. Years of trauma make me feel like it’s not okay and it’s just an option. So that’s where I’m at.

I started my current position almost 3yrs with the flexibility of being remote with occasional office requirements and it's been great. However, the beginning of this year they require all employees back in the office full time of February, me included. I accepted this as it's their company, their rules and need to follow them. So this week was my first time back in the office. I'm a sales person so use to some flexibility for appointments, coffees, luncheons and travel for clients and prospects. However, I was just informed that today that the company has ""hall monitors"" to make rounds and if your not in your office they are making notes and reporting beyond your manager. Example... I got up to use the restroom on Tuesday (first time I left my office since arriving at 8:30 and this was about 10) and HR happened to come by asking where I was. My coworker let them know I was here and just ran to the bathroom. But my manager's manager had an email that I was missing from my office at that time. Today my manager informed me that they are watching everyone and I have to clear all appointments/meeting even leaving for personal lunch prior. This is a senior position well into the six figures and I have almost 20yrs successful consistent work in the industry in multiple companies (they recruited me for this position). This seems insane and never heard or seen anything like this over the years and it's not just me but company wide. My immediate reaction was to quit but of course that's not realistic as I have a family that depends on my income. I just feel this company turned toxic overnight.

He kissed me goodbye and we talked on the phone while he got back to school. We became each other’s daily chat and started facetiming and snapping each other every day.

1ijlrs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1ijlrs3/psycharaist_confirm_my_mother_has_traits_of/,Psycharaist confirm my mother has traits of narcissism,"(Warning to readers there is some voilence in this message.) 

I was told by my psycharasit that my parent aka mother has traits of narcissism and trairs of borderline personality disorder.  E.g. which means emotional dysregulation. So one self struggles to regulate their own emotions. 

The psycharasit asked about my mum's behaviour since I was told by pervious psycharaist I had traits of BPD myself but in the interpersonal part. Meaning you perceive rejection if it's their or not in interpersonal situations. The key to BPD is literally sensitive  rejection to put it in basic form. 

After I mention about my mother's behaviour from growing up to current. He told me that narcissistic parents even traits develop children with BPD. 
I never knew this but it made alot of sense. 

I thought this was important to share since I can imagine some people in this form may struggle to regulate their emotions as well and it could be trairs of bpd and not know it's related to their parents.

The way it's developed is the narcissistic parent doesn't validated the child's emotions. Which I have heard is very important between the ages 0 to 7. Anyway for myself growing up my mother would tell me if I felt sad she would say ""Don't feel sad"". Or ""I wouldn't feel sad"". Once I went for treatment for BPD and I told my mum how to commicate how you feel she took it as a sign of manipulation. And still does even my sister believes it. Because hey a therapist is gonna teach their client to manipulate 🙄
This was before I knew my mum had trairs of narcissism. 

Her moods would go up and down. For example she suddenly got angry at the book case in the hall wag and how messy it was. And suddenly it was all my fault even though, it's been in that state for years. She would scream! To the point you could hear her outside. 

I spoke to my father who left my mum when I was  a kid. I asked him about if he experience with my mum getting angry and suddnely when you come back to the house and everything is calm she acts like none thing has happened. 
My father said yes he did experience this. 
And alot of her temper was related to mess. 
I'm not sure if it's a narcissistic thing but she seems to get angry over mess that's not really a mess. Say their is a notebook on the coffee table, suddnely that is a mess.

I was blamed for stupid things but it did took a toll on my confidence. 
Such as water bill was my fault, even though my sister's boyfriend was washing his clothes twice a day. 
The toilet spray that fell out from the windows frame,  is my fault. 
If there was micro tooth paste on the mirror it was my fault. It wasn't because her, me, my sister and her boyfriend and my partner where loving in the house at the time and it just built up over the week. 

She would call me names such as selfish (she loves calling everyone selfish by the way) pig, and b*tch. And it be over things such as I wanted to put my clothes in the dryer not on the hangers. 

She would tell me my therapist was ""wrong"" about things.

And that the therapist doesn't think like us. 
Whatever she means by that I don't know. 

At the age of 7-8 she put her hand on my throat because I said God is real. She asked how do I know this. 

She once held a knife to her chest and said to my sister and I when we were in our early 20's should I end my life. Because she was upset with her mother. She apologise to my sister but not me. 

She would drink alot of red wine. Every night.
And blame me I cause the house stressful. 

She would try and talk behind my back to my partner and say I was manipulative. It took my therapist to tell my mum I wasn't. Manipulative and it stopped. Thank goodness.

She got into my sister's head to call my therapist and say I was telling the wrong story about her.

I eventually moved out.
Now her brother lives with her and after 2 years he is moving out. He told her one time ""your girls told me , you drink too much and you get angry too often"". She would act as the victim that she couldn't kick out her brother out even though it was her house. Eventually it ended up them fighting. 

Now she is asking me and my partner to move back and goes on how we would save money than paying rent.

I'm thinking 1) why are you asking us back? 
You always said you wanted the house to yourself.


I'm just interested if anyone else has experience this?

I'm not as active in the Green Day fan community, but I wanted to share a project I started back in 2020. It’s a playlist of Billie Joe Armstrong's favorite songs—he was my favorite artist at the time—and I put it together to explore the bands that inspired him or that he shared on Instagram.

At the time, the pandemic was happening, and Billie was doing his No Fun Mondays cover series. Seeing him cover different songs made me curious about the bands he admired, so I started compiling this playlist. I sourced the songs from old setlists from his cover bands (The Coverups, The Del Gatos, and The Upside Downers), Oakland Coffee Playlist/Punk Bunny Radio, old live streams, and interviews where he mentioned bands he liked. Every time Billie posted a song on Instagram on his personal and Longshot accounts, I made sure to find a similar version on Spotify or YouTube so the experience would be as close as possible to what he was listening to. My goal was to create something that would let others discover new bands and get inspired, just like he did.

Through this playlist, I also discovered many bands and artists that Billie is associated with, which deepened my appreciation for the music scene he’s connected to. It was a fun and eye-opening experience to see how his influences shaped his own music.

That said, I deactivated all my Instagram accounts a few months ago for personal and mental health reasons and don’t plan on returning to social media. Because of that, the playlist hasn’t been updated since November 2024, but I felt like now was the right time to share it. Especially with recent discussions here about Billie taking a break, I thought this would be a great opportunity to celebrate the music he enjoys.

This playlist has been a part of my life for the past five years, and I hope some of you find it as enjoyable as I have!

This time, the butter never fully blended in, I think perhaps the meringue was too warm because I tried making a batch and a half at once and I think it overloaded my mixer a bit. I won’t be doing that again. Caramel turned out okay but it never really darkened up and I was afraid of burning it so it never really got an amber color although it does taste caramelly. And it never really firmed up either, it’s still pretty fluid as you can see. So instead of the crisp lovely design I was intending on, I called together this semi-decorative mess. 😭 However, I know everything tastes good: boyfriend and son tried scraps of cake from trimming with the caramel and frosting and thought it was amazing.

It was August 2003, and Clara, a 22-year-old university student, was returning home after a double shift at the hospital where she was an intern. She was so tired that she fell asleep in the back seat, her head hitting the cold glass. When he woke up, the bus was empty, parked in an abandoned terminal on the side of the road. The driver was gone. Outside the window, just a broken streetlight and a thick fog, the kind that seems to swallow the world.  

Clara got out, took a deep breath and walked towards the only house with lights on on the horizon. The door was ajar. Inside, a musty smell and something *cooking* — rotten meat, perhaps. On the walls, photos of smiling families, all with their faces scratched with nails. On the sofa, a porcelain doll held a note: **""You should know by now that you can't sleep.""**  

She didn't understand. Until that night.  

The first *figure* appeared when Clara finally arrived at her apartment, exhausted. It was a tall figure, too thin to be human, standing in the dark hallway. Its elongated arms swung like ropes, and where there should have been a face, there was only a blurry stain, like melted paint. Clara ran to her room, locked the door and swore she was hallucinating. But fatigue defeated her. She slept.  

When he woke up, his clock said 3:07 in the morning. The apartment was freezing. On the wall in front of the bed, a sentence written with something dark and sticky: **""We watched you sleep.""** The worst came when she noticed that the writing *wasn't on the wall*... *it was in the air*, as if the letters were floating in a mist of their own.  

The following days were a calculated nightmare. Every time Clara closed her eyes for more than a minute, she woke up to new signs: scratched doors, whispers in unknown languages, and the thin figure always closer. She stopped sleeping. He started drinking black coffee until his heart palpitated, but his mind was falling apart. In the photos she took to prove to herself that she wasn't crazy, figures crowded behind her, always with those *wrong* contours, as if the universe was trying to erase them.  

On the seventh day, she found a diary under her bed. It wasn't hers. The pages described experiments by a 1940s group studying sleep deprivation in soldiers. The subjects reported *""beings that inhabit the threshold between wakefulness and sleep""*, entities that fed on the energy of those who lost the ability to rest. The last note, scrawled in shaky letters: **""They grow stronger with your fear. The weaker you get, the more *real* they become.""**  

Clara understood too late.  

By the tenth night, she no longer recognized her own reflection. His eyes were dark craters, his skin stuck to his bones. The figures were no longer shadows—they had faces now. Faces of people she had known: her dead mother, an ex-boyfriend, the missing bus driver. Everyone smiled with sharp teeth and whispered the same phrase: **""Let us in.""**  

As she fell to the bathroom floor, unable to even scream, the thin figure finally touched her. His fingers were as thin as needles and burned like ice. Clara felt something being *extracted* from the back of her neck, a pain that was not physical, but rather that of the soul being ripped apart. In the fogged mirror, she saw her own image decomposing, as the figures pulled her into the glass.  

The next morning, the apartment was empty. No traces except a sweet smell of rotting meat and a note on the refrigerator:  

**""Thank you for not sleeping. Now we are you.""**  

To this day, on moonless nights, they say you can see Clara through the windows of night trains or buses. She is awake, always awake, with the same empty eyes and a smile that is too wide. And if you doze off near her, even for a second, you'll hear whispers *inside* your skull...

I took a Sunday night red eye flight to arrive by 7:30am on a Monday morning, and then I left on an 8:30am Thursday morning flight so I had three full days. I like to do nature oriented things like hiking and I'm not a fan of all the touristy gimmicks like zip lines. My main goal on this trip was to go birding. I didn't book tours because I wanted to stay on a smaller budget, and I included prices I paid for everything for others worried about budget. For reference since I don't mention it in the itinerary, my flight was free because of points, and I paid around $300 for the rental car, $45 to fill the gas tank once before dropping it off, and $350 for my hotels.

**Day 1**

* Picked up (pre-booked) rental car at SJO, grabbed a quick cheap bite and coffee at the little cafe outside of arrivals, and drove straight to Poas volcano. Drive to Poas took a little over an hour from SJO. The road was great. I looked into shuttle and bus options, but driving seemed to be the best bet for me as I had a lot of flexibility and was traveling solo. I wasn't planning to go anywhere super remote so I just got a tiny little subcompact and it worked out fine. 
* Poas has been active lately so they limit how many people can visit, and you can only spend 20 minutes at the top. I did not buy a ticket in advance and they still let me in, but I had to go online on my phone to buy it. You can really only spend about an hour up there right now with the limits as the hiking trails are closed. The crater was very cool though. The little gift shop there is nice, so I decided to get some early souvenirs. Admission to Poas is $17 online. 
* Ate at Freddo Fresas, which was very good. This whole area has a lot of strawberry-oriented food. It was a little pricy, I think because they're quite popular. I paid $23 for a big dinner, coffee, a slice of strawberry cake, and a strawberry soda. 
* Went to La Paz Waterfall Gardens nearby. Admission was $60. They seem to be a wildlife rehab, all the animals there are usually ones that were reclaimed from people keeping them as illegal pets. The aviary was really cool. I was in Costa Rica mostly to see birds, and I figured this way I wouldn't have to stress about seeing all the cool ones. The short hike to the waterfalls was quite nice too. I had some time to kill in the area so I decided to go here on a whim, I wouldn't say it's essential. 
* After La Paz Waterfall Gardens, I drove to La Fortuna. It took about 3 hours. The road between Poas and La Fortuna is not great (lots of potholes, not well paved in some stretches), so I would try to do this drive during the day. Driving through La Fortuna is a little hectic but otherwise not that many people on the road. Lots of sodas around if you need to stop for a meal somewhere. 
* I got to my hotel in La Fortuna. I decided to stay a little way's out of the main drag because it was too loud there for me. I was really tired from traveling so I ate dinner at my hotel's restaurant and went to sleep early. There are a lot of stray dogs barking at night and tons of birds squawking around here, and that made it hard to sleep. 

**Day 2**

*  My hotel had a really good breakfast so I ate there before heading out to explore.
* My first stop was La Fortuna Waterfall. This was my favorite waterfall of the whole trip. They were letting people swim in it when I went, and I regretted not bringing a bathing suit. Admission is $20. I was actually somewhat nervous to do this hike as it's a very steep set of stairs down for about 500m and then you have to climb back up, and there were tons of signs everywhere warning people about how steep it is. I ended up having no issue at all though. There were some people struggling on the stairs, so I would give yourself 30 mins to get back up. It's about 400 steps up and there is a water fountain at the halfway point.
* After the waterfall hike I wanted to do a hot springs outing. I booked a ticket the night before for Ecotermales Fortuna. The day pass that gets you in for the first part of the day is $49 online. I didn't bring my own towel so I wanted to do a hot springs that provides one for you, but I didn't want to go to one of the big fancy ones. This one felt somewhere in the middle. I only spent about an hour there but it was very refreshing.
* Next I stopped for lunch at Soda La Palma on the way to the Arenal hike. This place was really good. For $10, I got a big casado de pollo and coffee. There's also a mini mart next door if you need snacks or beverages. There's a little bird feeder behind the soda and I saw somewhat rare birds show up! 
* Next I went to the Arenal 1968 hike. It started raining quite hard so I'm glad I brought a poncho and umbrella. There are a few different trails there and they give you a map overview when you arrive. Admission is $26. Arenal had the best birding of anywhere I went for this time of year. I purchased a $15 laminated Costa Rican birds guide at a gift shop at Poas, brought my own binoculars, and downloaded the Merlin Bird ID app Costa Rica bird pack to my phone. I was able to see some really cool birds there. At the end of the hikes, there's a cafeteria that has a ton of really cool birds hanging out by it.
* I spent more time at Arenal than I planned so I ended up racing with the sunset to drive to Monteverde. Since I had a rental car, I had to go around the lake. There are some options via Waze to go other ways that require a 4x4 but those seem to take more time. If you don't rent a car, you can take a boat across the lake. The drive around Lake Arenal is very pleasant (and you may see some wildlife like coati!) until you get to Tilaran. After Tilaran, the roads are a nightmare. Potholes everywhere, most of it is unpaved. I definitely recommend doing this earlier in the day. The sun had set by the time I approached Monteverde and I was a bit stressed by the potholes. The entire drive from Arenal to Monteverde took around 3 hours. 
* I got to Monteverde at night. I was a bit tired so I opted to not do any night wildlife spotting. I grabbed dinner at Nativo Restobar which was great. It's a bit fancier. I did an entree and beer for $34. One thing I didn't realize is that this is still the ""windy season"" in Monteverde, and the winds were around 30 km/h. I stayed at a nice lodge close to the Cloud Forest and the wind kept waking me up. 

**Day 3**

* I had breakfast at my hotel before heading out to the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. Something to note: there is very little parking at the reserve itself. About 1km from the reserve, you'll see an official parking lot and the attendant will likely wave you down. You get your admission ticket here (it was $26) and then a shuttle takes you up to the reserve entrance. 
* I spent several hours in Monteverde. You can do a big chunk of it in 2 hours, but I was going at a meandering pace to watch for birds. I was able to see about 15 different species on my own but I think if you hire a private guide you may be able to see 40-50. I will note: because it's still the windy season, some of the cooler birds like quetzals weren't around. But I saw plenty of other ones I was excited about. 
* After Monteverde, I set out to go back to San Jose with a pit stop at the beach. Monteverde has two gas stations so this is where I stopped to fill my tank. After about 90 minutes of driving (on some awful roads), I stopped at Boca Barranca and Caldera to enjoy the beach a bit. I ate at a soda called Soda & Marisquería Katia which was right by the beach and had good seafood. It was a good spot to catch the sunset. 
* From there, I drove back to San Jose. The main highway has tolls. There are lanes for cars that have QuickPass or ones that say ""manual"" or ""tarjeta"" where you can pay with Apple Pay or a credit card. I think my total tolls for this section were around $4 as there were a few. This section of highway is extremely well paved so not stressful for night driving. 
* Arrived at my hostel in San Jose, explored the local area a bit, had dinner, and went to bed ready to drop my rental car off at SJO in the morning. 

General tips: 

* Most people seemed to speak English everywhere I went, especially hotels and tourist sites, but I speak Spanish and it was helpful. 
* Everyone accepts USD. I carried about $20 in colones on me just in case but otherwise used USD. They usually let you pick which you want to use. 
* Every place I went to accepted credit cards. My card has no fee for international transactions so I just used that.
* Don't drive at night, it sucks. I'm used to stressful driving and some of those mountain roads around Monteverde are next level. Lots of pedestrians and motorcyclists to watch out for, and trucks/buses taking turns like crazy. 
* I didn't feel like I needed a tour or guide for pretty much any part of this trip. All the hotels I stayed at had tours that you could book upon check-in too, so you can always ask them to hook you up with something if you're not sure what to book. 
* A ""soda"" is just a type of mom and pop diner. They're really cheap and delicious. ",4,1738898289.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

And im probably going to post frequently, as a way to immerse myself, and make the journey more fun, for me, so im sorry if im anoying to some of you or come off as all talk, 

but i think boredom is a issue, for the longest time i been trying to play games as a vice,  or watch anime, but i really want to give up on shows/anime and games and try to lock in and focus on business objectives.

The way that im going to be focusing, is simply have a attitude towards all things business. so for instance, i do have  shopify website, and i was charge 88.90 and did not understand, why, and saw a app i unistalled has charge me, so i reinstalled the app and contacted support to see if i can get a refund. 

  
and that wasnt me exactly focusing on business, but it was, so in a natural way, by having a attitude or temperament about my business and all things business. 

but there is a lot i can keep considering and considering, but from every job i had, and the current job i had, its not about having the perfect system or service, even, or product, its about sales, meaning getting a sale regardless of a perfect system or best product. 

and i think that's doable now, in my current stage of business.  and im willing negotiate prices and be as flexiable as possible in order to basically guarantee a sell. 

and i really care to have a solid income source, and fast income revenue, and i think if i simply make sales more common or something i can hire help and make it more of a passive income source that will allow me to focus on new ventures, 

  
and i will simply rinse and repeat the process, to snowball and get rich and buy the house i want, and get a girlfriend to be honest and get independent from family, 

but objectively i want to make enough to get my own place, and once i do i can be in a more comfortable environment to excel in. 

and the aim or goal for that would be to make at least $5000 a month or exactly 2.5 times the rent of this place that is close to my job: $3698

  
anyways to get started, i actually had a bit of success recently with a instagram ad, but was annoyed getting contacted by scamers, and someone eager to be interested in my service, but i made the process to facilitate the sell to complicated. 

so i want to learn from that experience and make the process to render service very quick and easy for the customer and in regards to facilitation of services

from my current job, i came to realized that technology is highly unintuitive to people and customers desperately need a helping hand, with everything, a guiding hand to everything, but customers dont even want to deal with all of it, they just want what they want and fast. 

hence why fast food is always in business and customer service can be hit or miss.

I do not know what constitutes as wants and needs or a problem for customers, well consumers, for instance the Stanley cup, everybody i see owns one, and like it's just a cup, seriously just a cup. 

But  i guess branding is the want, people love the brand, and will wear the brand to support the brand or be a part of a community.

im overthinking things, but i should care about branding first and foremost, ehh im just trying to get a sell before i start work.

The summer after my senior prom, Aiden took my first time.
Though the pain kept me awake all night, my heart was filled with sweet flutters.
I naively thought that a six-year crush had finally blossomed.
However, the next day in the school hallway, I overheard a conversation between him and his friend.
“Oh my god, you actually got with 'Miss Perfect'?” His friend was full of surprise.
I blushed shyly and was just about to walk over to say hello.
But Aiden's cold, dismissive tone froze me in place, “What I really wanted to go after was the cheerleader who exploded on Instagram. I'm just borrowing her for practice.”
Every word of his pierced my heart like a knife.
When I got home, I quietly logged on to the college website and switched my Columbia acceptance to Stanford.

Aiden's words hit me like a bolt of lightning from a clear sky, leaving me completely defenseless.

My mind went blank.

Despite the sweltering summer afternoon, I felt ice cold all over.

The conversation in the classroom continued. His friends fell silent for a moment before someone spoke again.

""Classic Aiden, using the perfect girl as practice.""

""So what, she's basically like his personal plaything?""

Aiden laughed carelessly. ""Come on guys, it's not like she didn't enjoy it.""

Someone quickly agreed. ""True that. Though she is kind of skinny compared to Madison's curves...""

Aiden threw a textbook at him, cutting him off mid-sentence. ""Look, we were both caught up in the moment. And she seemed pretty... eager.""

The guys exchanged knowing looks and started teasing him.

""Who knew Little Miss Perfect was so thirsty?""

""Can't blame her - our boy Aiden's got game. Might as well take what's offered.""

""After pining after you for so many years, bet she couldn't wait to get her hands on you.""

The laughter in the room grew louder.

I bit my lip hard, my hands clenched into fists.

It took everything I had just to stay standing outside that classroom door.

Footsteps echoed from the end of the hallway.

I snapped back to reality and fled, stumbling into a bathroom stall to hide.

Tears of heartbreak and humiliation streamed down my face.

Aiden's words echoed in my head, each syllable destroying what was left of my self-worth.

If I hadn't heard it myself, I wouldn't have believed the guy who'd passionately made love to me last night could be the same person. I guess you don't need love to be intimate. Even in those moments of intense passion, lies can still fall from your lips.

What I foolishly thought was the start of something real was just a joke to them.

The more I cried, the worse I felt, trying to muffle my sobs as my body shook.

After what felt like forever, my phone buzzed.

Aiden: [Take an Uber home. Got plans with the guys tonight, can't drive you.]

I didn't respond.

Aiden: [Don't forget to get Plan B yourself, I'm busy today. Make sure you take it, k?]

I stared at the messages, speechless.

Last night, from dusk till dawn, Aiden had been insatiable. Before we fell asleep exhausted in each other's arms, he'd drowsily whispered twice: ""Sorry I wasn't more prepared. I'll get you Plan B first thing tomorrow.""

He'd even lectured me about taking care of myself, insisting I needed to take the pill to protect my health.

Back then, I thought he was being responsible. I thought I'd finally found my happiness.

And now...

Reality hit me like a bucket of cold water.

I dug my nails into my palms, forcing myself to stop crying. After cleaning myself up, I left the bathroom.

Too embarrassed to go to the pharmacy, I ordered Plan B online. Even then, I waited forever after the delivery driver left it at my door before sneaking out to get it.

After swallowing the pill through tears, I collapsed onto my carpet, completely drained.

Ever since Aiden's family moved next door, I'd followed him around like a lost puppy - for ten whole years.

I'd never imagined a world without him in it. Never wanted to.

But now I had no choice.

Outside my window, city lights flickered on and off as evening settled in.

Time blurred until my best friend Maya's FaceTime lit up my screen.

""Brooklyn, why aren't you at the party with Aiden tonight? That girl Sarah from AP Lit showed up and she's all over him. They're making everyone uncomfortable.""

Maya flipped her camera around.

Through the dim corner of the VIP lounge, I watched Aiden and Madison pressed close together.

Madison wore a crop top and high-waisted jeans that highlighted her perfect figure. They'd created their own bubble, separate from everyone else, whispering intimately.

Even through the screen, their chemistry was undeniable.

My heart tightened painfully.

Just hours ago, Aiden said he wanted to pursue her. Clearly, he'd already succeeded.

When Madison drew ""Push-ups"" in Truth or Dare - where a guy had to do push-ups over a girl - Aiden volunteered instantly.

The crowd went wild.

Madison lay back on the couch, blushing. Aiden positioned himself above her, knocking out dozens of push-ups.

He was careful at first, maintaining distance. But on the last one - whether from exhaustion or intention - he collapsed right on top of her.

The room erupted in screams and whistles.

Both their faces flushed red. Then, amid the chaos, Aiden leaned down and kissed her.

Their makeout session lasted three endless minutes.

I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen, barely breathing, my heart being shredded to pieces.

I wanted to cry, but after this afternoon's breakdown, I had no tears left.

""Damn girl, you see that? They're literally perfect together,"" Maya said, before taking her phone to a quiet corner. ""Brooklyn, I'm sorry, but you needed to see this. You wouldn't have moved on otherwise.""

My voice came out raw. ""Yeah. Thanks.""

I had only myself to blame. For years, I'd thought being allowed to stay by Aiden's side meant that space was mine.

""I'm just so mad at him,"" Maya continued. ""He knew how you felt all these years, but he played innocent and let you fall deeper and deeper. After what you saw tonight, please don't let him waste another four years of your life in college...""

""He won't,"" I cut her off quietly.

""I've made my decision. I'm going to Stanford with you.

But Maya, promise me you'll keep it secret for now.""

To silence any second thoughts, I opened my laptop right there on FaceTime with Maya.

Without hesitation, moments before the midnight deadline, I logged into the Common App portal and changed my acceptance from Columbia to Stanford. The cursor hovered over the ""Confirm Change"" button for just a second before I clicked, watching my future transform with a single mouse click.

Maya was ecstatic, practically bouncing off her bed. She'd been begging me since junior year to join her at Stanford, painting pictures of California sunshine and Silicon Valley dreams.

Back in freshman year, Aiden and I had made a promise over late-night study sessions and shared dreams. We'd work hard, ace our SATs, and head to Columbia together. The aerospace engineering program there had been his dream since the day his dad took him to the Air & Space Museum when we were twelve.

Even though I never loved the idea of harsh New York winters or felt particularly drawn to Columbia's engineering focus, I'd spent three years of high school making it my goal. Every AP class, every SAT prep session, every extracurricular - all carefully chosen to match Columbia's requirements. I'd even joined the robotics club just because Aiden said it would look good on our applications.

After being neighbors for so long, both our families had already pictured our future together. His mom would invite me over for Sunday dinners, talking about how nice it would be to have both of us at Columbia, casually mentioning all her friends whose children had found their soulmates during freshman orientation. Everyone, including me, thought Aiden and I would naturally become a couple after graduation - the perfect high school sweetheart story.

Now, I couldn't find a single reason to go to Columbia anymore. The thought of walking those same campus paths with him, sharing classes, running into him and Madison at the library or campus coffee shops - it made me physically ill. Or rather, after today, if I kept trailing after Aiden like his faithful shadow, I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror.

I just needed to get as far away as possible. Stanford, Berkeley, UCLA - anywhere would do, as long as he wasn't there. The entire West Coast suddenly seemed like the perfect escape.

If he was going to the East Coast, then I'd head West. Three thousand miles and three time zones felt like a good start to forgetting the last six years of my life.

That night, I filled the bathtub to the brim with scalding water, watching steam rise in thick clouds. I desperately wanted to wash away every trace of the past twenty-four hours, as if enough hot water could somehow cleanse my soul along with my skin.

But as I undressed in front of the bathroom mirror, the purple-blue marks scattered across my skin told their own story. Love bites on my neck, fingerprint bruises on my hips - each one a reminder I couldn't erase. The bruises weren't ready to fade, just like the memories.

Last night came flooding back uninvited - his passionate breathing against my ear, the way he'd whispered my name in the dark. The ghost of his touch still lingered everywhere, like phantom hands tracing patterns across my body. The warmth of his che//st pressed against my back, his fingers intertwined with mine - memories I wanted to forget but couldn't seem to shake.

I shook my head violently, grabbing the sides of the sink until my knuckles turned white, trying to shake away these fragments of madness. These moments that meant everything to me and nothing to him.

I scrubbed and scrubbed until my skin turned angry red. My arms, my neck - anywhere his lips had been. As if I could somehow erase what had become the most humiliating memory of my life. The physical pain felt almost good, like maybe it could overshadow the ache in my heart.

The raw, stinging pain kept me tossing and turning all night. Every position hurt - my skin too sensitive, my body remembering touches I was trying to forget.

Aiden didn't text, of course. For the first time in six years, since we got our first iPhones in middle school, there was no ""goodnight"" message. No inside joke about his calculus homework. No stupid TikTok he thought would make me laugh. No heart emoji that I used to analyze for hours. Just deafening silence.

Better this way.

It had to end sometime.

I drifted in and out of consciousness until dawn approached, finally falling into an uneasy sleep somewhere between counting sheep and counting mistakes.

Just as morning light began filtering through my curtains, I felt what seemed like a gentle kiss on my forehead, so real it startled me from my dreams. For a moment, my heart stopped, thinking he might have used his spare key to check on me like he sometimes did before school.

I jer//ked awake to find that familiar jaw and throat above me.

His scent enveloped me - that cedar cologne he loved, now mixed with a faint trace of unfamiliar citrus. Probably Madison's perfume.

I'd almost forgotten Aiden knew my door code.

Seeing I was awake, he leaned down with smile, trying to kiss me.

I panicked, turning my head away and shoving him back, scrambling to the other side of my bed.

""Playing shy now? After last night?"" he chuckled.

I stayed silent, pulling the comforter over my head.

He started tugging at it. ""Really, Brooklyn? No goodnight text and your phone off? Since when do you ghost me?""

Before I could stop him, he slipped under the covers and pulled me against him.

""Come on, we've talked about skipping breakfast. I went on an early run just to get those chocolate croissants from that French bakery you love. Waited in line forever."" His voice dropped lower. ""Though we could always... work up an appetite first...""

His breath was hot on my skin, his hands starting to wander.

Finally coming to my senses, I struggled against him. But at 5'4"", I was no match for his 6'2"" frame.

I couldn't understand why he was even here. He had Madison now - why couldn't he just leave me alone?

""What's wrong? Mad I didn't take you to the party? That's what this is about?""

I remained silent.

He buried his face in my neck, laughing. ""Let me guess - Maya snitched about the party games? It was just Truth or Dare, babe. Why are you so jealous? You've always been like this - getting all moody whenever I talk to other girls.""

Fury surged through me. Remembering that self-defense class, I drove my knee up between his legs and bolted from the bed when he doubled over.

""Brooklyn!"" he growled through clenched teeth, face red with pain.

I grabbed a hoodie to cover my pajamas and fled to the living room. I couldn't be in my bedroom with him. Not anymore.

He followed shortly after, looking both angry and exasperated.

After a long pause, he asked casually, ""You took the Plan B, right? We can't have any... accidents. Our parents would freak.""

He picked up a boba tea from the table and held it out. ""Come on, drink something. You know your stomach gets upset when you skip meals.""

I didn't move or speak.

His arm stayed extended until his patience snapped.

""What's your problem? You can't throw a tantrum without a reason, Brooklyn.""

""I don't deserve this,"" I whispered.

He slammed the drink down so hard the plastic split, tea spilling across the carpet.

""What's that supposed to mean? Who do you think you are? We hook up once and suddenly you think you own me? You're suffocating me!""

His voice had never been so harsh.

Instantly, tears streamed down my face, yesterday's humiliation and pain flooding back.

Aiden seemed startled by my reaction, suddenly awkward.

""Sorry, I was drunk last night. I shouldn't have snapped.""

He crouched beside me, reaching to wipe my tears, but I flinched away.

He froze, hand suspended mid-air.

His phone buzzed. One glance at the screen and his expression changed completely.

""I have to go. Cool off, okay? We're starting college soon - you need to grow up. No one likes drama.""

Less than thirty minutes after Aiden left, Maya sent me a screenshot.

It was Madison's Instagram post: ""Perfect morning ☀️ Say you're hungry and your crush magically appears with breakfast. I think this might be turning into something real... ?""

The photo showed the exact same box of chocolate croissants from my kitchen table.

I didn't reply.

Just silently wiped my tears and knelt down to clean up the spilled boba tea. After scrubbing forever, I realized with frustration that the stain had soaked deep into the wool carpet fibers. It wasn't coming out.

In a burst of anger, I rolled up the entire carpet and threw it away. It was the one Aiden and his parents had spent an entire afternoon picking out in Nepal and carried back as a gift anyway.

While I was at it, I gathered everything Aiden had left at my house, plus every gift he'd ever given me. Even all our photos together - from prom pictures to casual selfies - went into garbage bags.

It took all day to pack up and throw away six years of memories. Not like he'd want any of this stuff anyway.

After that day, I didn't hear from him for days. Things must be going well with Madison. Or maybe he was waiting for me to cave first - like I always did during our fights, without exception.

But this time, I didn't reach out.

There was no point anymore.

I blocked him on everything - Instagram, Snapchat, texts, calls. Changed my door code. Deactivated all my social media accounts.

After that purge, I called my parents who were away on business. Told them I wanted to spend the summer with Aunt Claire in Boston.

My plan was to stay there until fall, then head straight to Stanford with Maya. Besides her, no one knew I'd switched schools.

This way, I could perfectly avoid any chance of running into Aiden.

Mom teased me on the phone: ""Ooh, planning a romantic summer getaway with Aiden?""

I made up some excuse, not wanting to explain. Just said I missed Aunt Sarah and Grandma.

Begged Dad to book me on the next available flight - I needed to leave tonight.

But as I was heading out, I ran into Aiden's mom by our driveways.

""Brooklyn, sweetie! Where's Aiden? Isn't he taking you to Aspen for skiing? He mentioned planning a special trip - you have my full blessing!""

I was confused.

During senior year finals, I had mentioned wanting to go skiing in Aspen, dreaming about a winter getaway.

But given everything, a romantic trip seemed ridiculous now.

Running late for my flight, I mumbled some excuse and hurried off.

What I didn't expect was to see Aiden himself at the airport.

He was with a group of friends. Madison was there too.

Aiden carried her designer bag in one hand while his other arm wrapped around her waist. They walked at the back of the group.

Whenever Madison wanted to tell him something, she'd lean in close, and he'd attentively bend down to listen.

Not like with us.

Aiden had always been taller than me, growing more so every year. I always had to bounce on my tiptoes, craning my neck just to talk to him.

I guess for someone he actually cares about, he makes the effort to meet them halfway.

I took a deep breath.

Told myself to show some dignity. His life wasn't my business anymore - I'd slap myself if I kept overthinking this.

But there seemed to be only one path to the gates.

I had no choice but to trail far behind them.

Finally, we reached a fork in the terminal.

Aiden started getting antsy.

He made several calls that went unanswered, then spent ages staring at his phone. Finally, he borrowed a friend's phone and headed toward the restrooms, looking stormy.

Moments later, my phone rang - unknown number.

""Brooklyn, you're really committed to this silent treatment, huh? Won't even reach out unless I make the first move?

And blocking me? Real mature.

Good luck keeping this up. Let's see how you handle Columbia alone when you don't know anyone there.""

Aiden's tone was harsh as he laid into me.

I stayed silent - there was nothing to say.

This only seemed to anger him more.

""Whatever. Just unblock me on Instagram already.

I'm heading overseas with friends for a couple days, might be hard to reach. Don't want you crying because you can't get hold of me.""

I couldn't even bother giving him a single word.

Just hung up and turned off my phone.

From a distance, I watched him storm back to the group. He grabbed Madison's hand and headed left toward their gate without hesitation.

I sighed, turned right, and walked away.",2,1738897925.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

(M31 & F30),"I was with my girlfriend, Q, for 5 years. She was kind, understanding, and a beautiful soul. We had a million of amazing memories together. I admit, I can be stubborn and say things without thinking.

The issue? I stayed in contact with my ex, G, who has severe depression and suicidal tendencies. I would pick her up from psych wards. I would check up on her to see if she is ok over the phone and text and met her over 5 years probably 10 times for coffee. Our texts were just nonsense and totally goofy. We had 0 feelings for each and I never cheated, and only checked in as a support system. Q found out six weeks ago and ended things, saying she can't trust me anymore. She also said if she will be with me, she would hate herself for it.

I’m heartbroken and want her back. She did not reply to my recent text about being careful in stormy weather. Has anyone been in a similar situation and made it work? I do want to call her but I don’t know how to start, besides the fact that I understand how much pain I caused her. Any advice would mean a lot.",2,1738897550.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

My husband of 12 years has transformed from a reasonable conservative into what I can only describe as a Trump cult member, and it's destroying our marriage.

Our house has become a literal shrine to Trump. I wish I was exaggerating. There's a 6-foot Trump cardboard cutout in our living room that he talks to every morning like some sort of religious ritual. Our walls, once decorated with family photos, are now plastered with Trump flags. He even replaced our American flag with a ""Trump 2024 or Death"" banner. My kids are embarrassed to have friends over.

Last week was the final straw. He spent $3,000 of our savings on ""limited edition"" Trump gold-plated coins and a ""certified authentic"" piece of Mar-a-Lago toilet paper. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. When I confronted him about taking money from our children's college fund, he said ""Trump University will be reopened and make education great again."" I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.

Every dinner conversation somehow turns into a Trump sermon. He'll randomly shout ""STOP THE STEAL"" during family meals. When our 15-year-old daughter got an A+ on her history project about the Civil War, he accused her teacher of being a ""communist infiltrator"" for not teaching ""the truth about Trump's victory.""

Our bedroom... God, I'm mortified to even type this. He insists on keeping a giant Trump portrait above our bed because ""Trump watches over us."" He even got a Trump tattoo on his chest and keeps trying to convince me to get one too. He calls it his ""Mark of Patriotism.""

His entire personality has been consumed. He changed his wardrobe to only red clothing. He refers to himself as a ""Digital Soldier"" and spends hours posting on Truth Social. When I asked him to help with our son's homework, he said he was too busy ""fighting the deep state online.""

The paranoia is getting worse. He installed cameras around our house to ""watch for Antifa."" He thinks our neighbors are ""deep state agents"" because they have a pride flag. He threw out our coffee maker because ""Starbucks is funding the radical left."" He even accused our golden retriever of being ""suspiciously woke"" because she didn't bark at a Biden commercial.

Our sex life? He insists on playing Trump rally speeches in the background and keeps trying to get me to wear a Melania mask. I wish I was joking. He has different MAGA hats for different occasions - including one specifically for ""bedroom patriot time."" I'm dying inside.

I found receipts showing he's donated over $15,000 to various Trump-related causes this year alone. Money we needed for our mortgage. When I showed him our overdue bills, he said ""Trump will fix the economy and make us rich."" We're facing foreclosure, but he keeps buying Trump merchandise.

Yesterday, he announced he's legally changing his name to ""Donald J. Trump Smith"" and wants our kids to follow suit. Our 10-year-old son started crying, and my husband told him ""real patriots don't cry"" and made him watch four hours of rally footage as ""testosterone training.""

I've tried everything - marriage counseling (he called the therapist a socialist), family interventions (he disowned his own mother for suggesting he get help), even pleading with his Trump-supporting friends to tell him he's going too far. Nothing works. He just goes deeper into the rabbit hole.

The worst part? Under all this Trump worship, I know my real husband is still in there somewhere. Sometimes, late at night, I catch glimpses of the man I married. But then morning comes, he puts on his MAGA hat, salutes the Trump cutout, and the cycle begins again.",9,1738897537.0,copypasta,0,0.85,False

There's a coworker(F early 30s) who I find attractive and I had some blunders of bad jokes with early on(nothing sexual), got nervous around and started avoiding for a while.

I would sometimes muster the courage to say hi(she has to be passed coming into work), other times go a long away around to avoid her.

The weird thing is she keeps extending olive branches and then we get on well for a while. Then I still get nervous around her, it appears to me she picks up on it and she then seems to start avoiding me eye contact wise and discussion wise.

I had a conversation outside work one day to say I knew that things were awkward and I was sorry, I wanted to joke around but I thought it would be rude if I just started again out of nowhere. She told me I was thinking too much and not to worry about joking around.

I get on well with everyone else at my work, as does she.

It's driving me crazy because I feel like such an idiot/creep.

I don't get why she keeps being nice to me eventually. Obviously part of me wants to believe she also likes me. To be clear, I will never tell her I think she's attractive or ask her out because A. Coworker bad idea and B. With my behaviour I can't see how this wouldn't be creepy as fuck and almost harassment. She already knows why I am so weird so it doesn't matter but saying it for whatever the reason can't happen. But god it seems like she loves toying with me.

The only way it could be said I see would be to clear the air which part of me wants to say ""let's go for coffee sometime I want to make sure we're cool"". And just be honest so I can stop being weird. To be clear not to ask her out but just to be like listen I am sorry this is who I am, I'm trying to control it, etc. But I think this is a bad idea as well, dumping my shit onto her which she already knows.

When I was avoiding looking at her and then I would casually glance at her when we were in group, she would be there ready to look at me and start making funny faces like a surprised look straight into my eyes. Or I'm on my phone and she comes up saying ""what are you looking at porn"". She makes a ton of inappropriate jokes.

Basically I'm not sure I can take this back and forth. I'd love to be friends but I'm just too stupid.

What's polite and appropriate? Should I bother even saying hi to her? I don't want her to think I'm trying to get with her. Just let her do all the talking if she decides to? How do I just stay professional without being rude? Should I even bother to say hi?

FYI she is not a bad person, very helpful to everyone and close with her family, etc.

The total investment would be around 100,000–120,000k for the full package, excluding rental costs and the actual construction of the shop. The required space is only about 29 sqm, so construction expenses should be minimal.

I’m particularly interested in hearing from those who already own a coffee shop—how has your experience been? Would you say it’s a worthwhile investment?

For context, the location is near a school and a tricycle terminal beside a public market.

The downside is that the market closes at around 6 PM, so the foot traffic significantly decreases after that. This means the shop’s operating hours would likely be limited to 8 AM to 6 PM only. ",1,1738897409.0,phinvest,1,1.0,False

Just to give some basic information about me and him: 
I’m a trans gay man, and I’ve been out for about 2 years now. I’m not on any hormones or had any surgeries, so most people still see me as a “woman.” The guy that I have feelings for is a cis gay man who I met also around 2 years ago when we first entered college. I met him through mutual friends, so we run in the same social circle. Anyways, when I first met him, I thought he was really cute, and I was interested in him. I’m kind of socially awkward though so I didn’t really talk to him much at first. Then I learn that he really likes video games, so we start playing some games together in our college game room (it’s like an area in our student center with a bunch of PC’s and consoles). I got to know him a little bit, and that’s when I started having actual feelings for him. Long story short, I told him I had feelings for him, and at the time he was going through a situationship with a guy. I don’t know if that had anything to do with it, but he told me that he didn’t feel the same, and I understood and told him that I still wanted to be friends, but I would understand if he doesn’t. 
So yeah, we did get kinda distant after that happened. We didn’t really talk much, but we would still occasionally run into each other and end up playing some games. Flash forward to December of 2024 during Christmas break: he starts texting me because he got a game off of steam that I really love. He basically send me a text of like “I got (insert game here.” And we started talking about the game and other things because of it. This kept going throughout December until like a week into January where he stopped answering and left me on delivered. It was very stressful at the time because me and some friends from my hometown were planning to visit his area to see our friends that live up where he does (friends from college). So we go on the trip and I’m kinda scared because I don’t want to see him after he kinda ghosted me for a week, and when we get there he joins us. Literally the first thing he says to me is “omg. I just realized that I haven’t been responding to messages at all lately when (insert friend’s name here) texted me about yall arriving today.” And I was kinda pissed so I said “yeah. You haven’t. It’s been a week.” And I walked off to talk to some other friends. 
After that happened, we kept walking through their local shopping thing and I wanted to go to the coffee shop there, but the group was busy looking at other things. He and another friend said that they also wanted to go, so us three went ahead. It was weird, but normal I guess. We got our drinks and met back up with the group who then wanted to go to the cafe (of course) so we all walked back there together. I didn’t feel like going back inside cuz it was crowded so I sat at this two person table (there was like a row of them) by a big window. The view was kinda nice, and another photographer friend got some really cool photos. Well, he joined me at the table and sat across from me, and the photographer friend took a picture of us. We talked about a TV show and the game that he got over the break, and then realized that the group was walking off without us. So we followed and somehow got separated from them(?). So it was just us walking through the place. We actually did talk about him ghosting me and he apologized. This went on for a while and we were just hanging out with each other, and I even ended up riding in his car to go to a park and to dinner. In the car, he opened up about some things he was going through. We actually had a deep conversation about our life situations, and it was nice. He also only played music by my favorite artist so I was very happy. 
The same thing kinda occurred the next day, except me and my hometown group had to pick him up to take him to a place that was like an hour out. I was sitting in the back with him and another friend, and I was in the middle. Nothing much happened, just car singing. When we got to the place (a thrift store but like huge), it ended up being just us two again walking through the place. Again, we just talked and joked and explored. We stayed for like two hours before heading back, and on the drive back he fell asleep. Now he didn’t put his head on me, but his body was like slouched against mine. And all I could think was that I didn’t want to move or talk because I didn’t want to disturb him. We dropped him off and I didn’t see him anymore on the trip.
This was like a week before school got back in. And he actually asked me and a friend if we wanted to get dinner, but the other friend wasn’t back in town yet. Me and him ended up getting dinner and even headed back to my place to hang out and play video games. This continued except I’ve been going over to his place the last few times over the last couple of weeks. He asks if I want to hang out and offers to pick me up, and then we either get dinner and go or he drives me to his place. The last couple of times, we’ve just been doing homework and school stuff for like a couple hours, and then we play video games, talk, and etc. Nothing romantic or sexual has happened. This last weekend, we drank and got a little tipsy, but we were just having a silly goofy time. Anyway, I’m where I am now. I think I have feelings for him again, and I’m just confused. Only one of my friends knows what’s happening and she’s been worried and telling me that I need to stop this. I know I should probably listen to her, but I also really enjoy hanging out with him. And I would think he has feelings for me too, but there’s the fact that he rejected me last year and he doesn’t text me back a lot of the time. He’s also a really dry texter and leaves me on delivered for days. 
Then there’s the fact that I’m trans. I don’t know how he feels about trans people or dating them, but most cis gay men prefer not to because of genital preference. I’m also like preT and preTop surgery, and I probably won’t be able to access those things any time soon with the state of the world. 
I just don’t know if I should drop him, ghost him, talk to him, or just continue whatever this is. I really like him and care about him, but I also value his friendship and not jeopardizing whatever we’ve built back after our long period of not really talking.

I’m kind of socially awkward though so I didn’t really talk to him much at first. Then I learn that he really likes video games, so we start playing some games together in our college game room (it’s like an area in our student center with a bunch of PC’s and consoles). I got to know him a little bit, and that’s when I started having actual feelings for him. Long story short, I told him I had feelings for him, and at the time he was going through a situationship with a guy. I don’t know if that had anything to do with it, but he told me that he didn’t feel the same, and I understood and told him that I still wanted to be friends, but I would understand if he doesn’t. 
So yeah, we did get kinda distant after that happened. We didn’t really talk much, but we would still occasionally run into each other and end up playing some games. Flash forward to December of 2024 during Christmas break: he starts texting me because he got a game off of steam that I really love. He basically send me a text of like “I got (insert game here.” And we started talking about the game and other things because of it. This kept going throughout December until like a week into January where he stopped answering and left me on delivered. It was very stressful at the time because me and some friends from my hometown were planning to visit his area to see our friends that live up where he does (friends from college). So we go on the trip and I’m kinda scared because I don’t want to see him after he kinda ghosted me for a week, and when we get there he joins us. Literally the first thing he says to me is “omg. I just realized that I haven’t been responding to messages at all lately when (insert friend’s name here) texted me about yall arriving today.” And I was kinda pissed so I said “yeah. You haven’t. It’s been a week.” And I walked off to talk to some other friends. 
After that happened, we kept walking through their local shopping thing and I wanted to go to the coffee shop there, but the group was busy looking at other things. He and another friend said that they also wanted to go, so us three went ahead. It was weird, but normal I guess. We got our drinks and met back up with the group who then wanted to go to the cafe (of course) so we all walked back there together. I didn’t feel like going back inside cuz it was crowded so I sat at this two person table (there was like a row of them) by a big window. The view was kinda nice, and another photographer friend got some really cool photos. Well, he joined me at the table and sat across from me, and the photographer friend took a picture of us. We talked about a TV show and the game that he got over the break, and then realized that the group was walking off without us. So we followed and somehow got separated from them(?). So it was just us walking through the place. We actually did talk about him ghosting me and he apologized. This went on for a while and we were just hanging out with each other, and I even ended up riding in his car to go to a park and to dinner. In the car, he opened up about some things he was going through. We actually had a deep conversation about our life situations, and it was nice. He also only played music by my favorite artist so I was very happy. 
The same thing kinda occurred the next day, except me and my hometown group had to pick him up to take him to a place that was like an hour out. I was sitting in the back with him and another friend, and I was in the middle. Nothing much happened, just car singing. When we got to the place (a thrift store but like huge), it ended up being just us two again walking through the place. Again, we just talked and joked and explored. We stayed for like two hours before heading back, and on the drive back he fell asleep. Now he didn’t put his head on me, but his body was like slouched against mine. And all I could think was that I didn’t want to move or talk because I didn’t want to disturb him. We dropped him off and I didn’t see him anymore on the trip.
This was like a week before school got back in. And he actually asked me and a friend if we wanted to get dinner, but the other friend wasn’t back in town yet. Me and him ended up getting dinner and even headed back to my place to hang out and play video games. This continued except I’ve been going over to his place the last few times over the last couple of weeks. He asks if I want to hang out and offers to pick me up, and then we either get dinner and go or he drives me to his place. The last couple of times, we’ve just been doing homework and school stuff for like a couple hours, and then we play video games, talk, and etc. Nothing romantic or sexual has happened. This last weekend, we drank and got a little tipsy, but we were just having a silly goofy time. Anyway, I’m where I am now. I think I have feelings for him again, and I’m just confused. Only one of my friends knows what’s happening and she’s been worried and telling me that I need to stop this. I know I should probably listen to her, but I also really enjoy hanging out with him. And I would think he has feelings for me too, but there’s the fact that he rejected me last year and he doesn’t text me back a lot of the time. He’s also a really dry texter and leaves me on delivered for days. 
Then there’s the fact that I’m trans. I don’t know how he feels about trans people or dating them, but most cis gay men prefer not to because of genital preference. I’m also like preT and preTop surgery, and I probably won’t be able to access those things any time soon with the state of the world. 
I just don’t know if I should drop him, ghost him, talk to him, or just continue whatever this is. I really like him and care about him, but I also value his friendship and not jeopardizing whatever we’ve built back after our long period of not really talking.

1ijl489,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ijl489/got_fired_after_my_first_5_hours/,Got fired after my first 5 hours.,"So. I've been job hunting for two months now, applied to about 50 jobs, and finally get an interview.

It was for a barista position, and once I arrived I am instantly hired and put on schedule.

A few days later, I show up to start training, and learn about my duties and responsibilities.

Two hours before my shift ended, my boss told me I could leave early because she didn't want to ""overwhelm"" me on my first day.

Once I started driving I got the feeling that she would fire me -- not even an hour after I get home I get a call which lasted 30 seconds summed up by ""you were not a good fit for this position.""

This is a $7.23/hr BARISTA job where you take orders, be friendly to customers, and make coffee. What more do they want? I wouldn't be complaining about this if I made any mistakes or did anything wrong.

After the call I drove my ass back there to drop off my uniform. A huge waste of time and gas. Why do companies do this???",70,1738897215.0,jobs,36,0.95,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ijl3vw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1ijl3vw/today_is_day_29_of_no_sugar/,Today is day 29 of no sugar,"I just found this subreddit. 

I did a 30 day challenge of having no sugar at the start of last year (no added sugar, no artificial sugar, fruit is okay) and now this year as well. It's super interesting. Honestly, I think it was so much harder last year than this year. At some point you just stop thinking about sugar. You still crave it a little bit from time to time, but it's like oh I could go without it. I feel like I want the ""idea of sugar"" more than I *really* want it if that even makes sense. Like I think of a brownie, or a sweet coffee drink and I'm like oh that looks tasty. But I kind of forget what it might taste like. 

  
I'll admit I haven't been perfect. I've had maybe 3 squares of dark chocolate, a few luna bars that have a small amount of added sugar and this morning I had a really small cup of sugary coffee. But I don't think it's about being perfect. I'm not doing this to loose weight. I don't know if it's my imagination but I feel like I sleep better, I don't have energy crashes as much. It's also interesting because at the beginning I really hated drinking my coffee without sugar, and now it tastes really good to me. 

It's crazy to me because I doubt less than 1% of the population nowadays has ever tried to go so long without having any desserts/added sugar. But back in the day, you would never see an ounce of cane sugar in your life.",8,1738897188.0,sugarfree,0,1.0,False

Just to give some basic information about me and him: 
I’m a trans gay man, and I’ve been out for about 2 years now. I’m not on any hormones or had any surgeries, so most people still see me as a “woman.” The guy that I have feelings for is a cis gay man who I met also around 2 years ago when we first entered college. I met him through mutual friends, so we run in the same social circle. Anyways, when I first met him, I thought he was really cute, and I was interested in him. I’m kind of socially awkward though so I didn’t really talk to him much at first.

I got to know him a little bit, and that’s when I started having actual feelings for him. Long story short, I told him I had feelings for him, and at the time he was going through a situationship with a guy. I don’t know if that had anything to do with it, but he told me that he didn’t feel the same, and I understood and told him that I still wanted to be friends, but I would understand if he doesn’t. 
So yeah, we did get kinda distant after that happened. We didn’t really talk much, but we would still occasionally run into each other and end up playing some games. Flash forward to December of 2024 during Christmas break: he starts texting me because he got a game off of steam that I really love. He basically send me a text of like “I got (insert game here.” And we started talking about the game and other things because of it. This kept going throughout December until like a week into January where he stopped answering and left me on delivered. It was very stressful at the time because me and some friends from my hometown were planning to visit his area to see our friends that live up where he does (friends from college).

Ideally something that doesn't cost money but if it's a reasonably small fee then that's fine. More details below.

I'd like to go out somewhere at least once a week instead of rotting all day at home when I don't have work or class since it's wreaking havoc on my mental health. But every single suggestion I find is ""Go out for a walk! Go to the park! Play a sport! Go hiking! Go to the beach!"" I'm not an outdoorsy guy (I hate standing outside in the sun) nor am I a socialite guy, so you can imagine how hard it is for me to find things to do in Hawaii. Even if my fatass is just sitting and scrolling Reddit in a different location I'm up for that as long as it's not my house (or the library, the library's great but I work in a library so I need to get away from that sometimes).

Coffee shops or cafes are nice, someplace without ridiculously overpriced food or drink would be ideal (so not Starbucks). I don't mind a little physical activity, so walking around like maybe a museum or art exhibit or even a VERY CASUAL nature trail sounds nice. The only ones I can think of seem like I'd have to plan a whole afternoon trip to go to though. Ala Moana area is ideally the furthest I'd like to go unless it's a REALLY good suggestion, so long as it's not like Pearl City or something. I'm a writer and artist (creatively inclined), I don't drink alcohol, and I live near Koko Marina to help narrow down suggestions. I do have a car though I'd rather avoid places with street parking.

I’ve sampled a kajillion roses, lots that I liked, and I decided to pick my 64 favorites and have them face off against each other. There’s a ton to cover in Round 1, so I’ve split the initial 64 into a Western and Eastern division, and today I’m posting the results of the Western matchups.

Here’s [how it started](https://i.imgur.com/ffrxdQp.jpeg), and here’s [how it looks now](https://i.imgur.com/EIHCODa.jpeg).

# Round 1: Western Division

[**Floral Street Chypre Sublime**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Floral-Street/Chypre-Sublime-47214.html) **vs** [**Etat Libre d’Orage Spice Must Flow**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Etat-Libre-d-Orange/Spice-Must-Flow-53041.html)  
Chypre Sublime is a rich true retro rose with no soapiness or powderiness, but also something unpleasant lurking in the background - maybe the patchouli? Spice Must Flow is a crumbling rose left to desiccate on the surface of a sun-baked desert planet, but after some time it becomes a tame, lovely thing. The drydown and the gorgeous bottle edges it out over Chypre Sublime. **Winner: Spice Must Flow**

[**Diptyque Eau Rose EDP**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Diptyque/Eau-Rose-Eau-De-Parfum-71661.html) **vs** [**Essential Parfums Rose Magnetic**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Essential-Parfums/Rose-Magnetic-50787.html)  
Eau Rose EDP has a lovely rose note that is often overshadowed by a watery green artichoke. I like it sometimes, and other times I’m not so sure. Rose Magnetic is sometimes more of a citrus candy that a rose, and its rose is soapy. I have called in my partner as tiebreaker, who prefers Rose Magnetic and says Eau Rose EDP smells like a Christmas tree. **Winner: Rose Magnetic**

[**Diptyque Eau Rose EDT**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Diptyque/Eau-Rose-14214.html) **vs** [**Maison Francis Kurkdjian À la Rose**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maison-Francis-Kurkdjian/A-La-Rose-29083.html)  
Eau Rose EDT is an excellent “clean girl” spa rose, with just enough depth to keep it from being too fresh for me. Watery, but not thin. I can only complain that it’s a pink rose, not red. À la Rose is also a pink rose, but it’s more of what I dislike about that type of fresh rose - thin, musky, powdery, short-lived. **Winner: Eau Rose EDT**

[**Matiere Premiere Radical Rose**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Matiere-Premiere/Radical-Rose-66043.html) **vs** [**Dusita La Douceur de Siam**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-Dusita/La-Douceur-de-Siam-40837.html)  
Radical Rose is Greek church and Nag Champa, but barely any rose for me. La Douceur de Siam is also light on the rose; all I get is airy musk for a couple hours and then it’s gone. I don’t much like either one but someone has to move up, so - **Winner: Radical Rose**

[**Dustita Rosarine**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-Dusita/Rosarine-80375.html) **vs** [**Miller Harris Scherzo**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Miller-Harris/Scherzo-49608.html)  
Rosarine is unbelievably beautiful, a velveteen rose with black-red petals. Scherzo is yet another oud rose - better than most I’ve smelled, but still not my bag. **Winner: Rosarine**

[**Lush Rose Jam**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lush/Rose-Jam-2019-63243.html) **vs** [**Une Nuit Nomade Jardins de Misfah Extrait**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Une-Nuit-Nomade/Jardins-de-Misfah-98058.html)  
Rose Jam is one of my early loves, a super-sweet jammy rose, but sometimes I smell something acrid and synthetic in it. I had high hopes for Jardins’ honey and rose, but I really only smell dates. **Winner: Rose Jam**

[**Chloé Roses de Chloé**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chloe/Chloe-Roses-de-Chloe-18702.html) **vs** [**Narciso Rodriguez Musc Noir Rose For Her**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Narciso-Rodriguez/Musc-Noir-Rose-For-Her-71596.html)  
Roses de Chloé is pure pink rosy-ass rose, clean and fresh and wet. It’s a bit musky, but not nearly as much as Musc Noir Rose, which smells less like rose and more like an otter fell asleep in a pile of laundry sheets. **Winner: Roses de Chloé**

[**Etat Libre d’Orange 500 Years**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Etat-Libre-d-Orange/500-Years-53040.html) **vs** [**Parfums de Marly Delina Exclusif**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Delina-Exclusif-50370.html)  
500 Years is a big stinky camphor rose with naugahyde petals. It smells like Sharpies on fire. I should hate it but I don’t?? At least, not as much as I hate Delina Exclusif, which smells like rose baby powder smeared in unwashed armpits. **Winner: 500 Years**

[**Elizabeth & James Nirvana Rose**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Elizabeth-and-James/Nirvana-Rose-40267.html) **vs** [**Le Labo Rose 31**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Le-Labo/Rose-31-3678.html)  
I own and love a couple other E&J Nirvanas, but Nirvana Rose smells like vetiver and stale beer to me. Rose 31 has a chapstick note that I can’t decide if I love or not. **Winner: Rose 31**

[**Guerlain Rose Barbare**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Guerlain/Rose-Barbare-1020.html) **vs** [**Zaharoff Signature Rosé**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zaharoff/Signature-Rose-68189.html)  
Rose Barbare smells so smooth, I’m not sure I would have clocked it as rose if it wasn’t on the label. I like it, though. Signature Rosé is tart, sugared, exotic, like rose candy served on a golden tray in a nomad’s tent. Unfortauntely, there is a note in the background that makes me think of being in the paper aisle of a Costco warehouse. **Winner: Rose Barbare**

[**Tauer Une Rose de Kandahar**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Tauer-Perfumes/PHI-Une-Rose-de-Kandahar-21982.html) **vs** [**Mancera Roses Vanille**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Mancera/Roses-Vanille-15210.html)  
Une Rose de Kandahar shiocked me by how much I detested it - it smells very old-fashioned, and I can almost feel some nauseating dusty note in the back of my throat. Roses Vanille was also a surprising letdown; it had an oddly meaty note. Under duress, I must choose one - **Winner: Roses Vanille**

[**Parfums de Marly Delina la Roseé**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Delina-La-Rosee-64667.html) **vs** [**Tom Ford Rose Prick**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Tom-Ford/Rose-Prick-58781.html)  
Delina La Roseé is the only member of this family I can stand, a pretty and transparent peony-rose. Rose Prick is unfortunately sweaty, dirty, and masculine. **Winner: Delina la Roseé**

[**Serge Lutens La Fille de Berlin**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Serge-Lutens/La-Fille-de-Berlin-17162.html) **vs** [**Aesop Rozu**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Aesop/Rozu-64167.html)  
La Fille de Berlin literally took my breath away. Juicy, but not fruity. Jammy, but not cooked. Neon, but not screechy. I am in love with it and almost ready to stop this game and call it now. Alas, I already spent all this time on the stupid bracket template. Rozu smells like McDonald’s pickles, but it never had a chance anyway. **Winner: La Fille de Berlin**

[**Mancera Roses Greedy**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Mancera/Roses-Greedy-18042.html) **vs** [**Moschino Toy Boy**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Moschino/Toy-Boy-55858.html)  
Roses Greedy is a huge, loud, slutty rose that doesn’t apologize for itself and I respect that. Toy Boy is a plastic rose in a wooden box that used to hold real geraniums. I don’t want to love it but I really do. **Winner: Toy Boy**

[**Jo Malone Taif Rose**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jo-Malone-London/Taif-Rose-100146.html) **vs** [**Regime des Fleurs Chloë Sevigny Little Flower**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Regime-des-Fleurs/Chloe-Sevigny-Little-Flower-56715.html)  
The rose in Taif Rose is the velvety dark-red that I love, and the coffee note is rich and true, but together they’re like two divas trying to out-sing each other on the same stage. Little Flower is a delight, although it’s not terribly rose-centric; blackcurrant and canned lemon tea are major notes. **Winner: Little Flower**

[**Tom Ford Rose de Chine**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Tom-Ford/Rose-de-Chine-71539.html) **vs** [**Hermès Hermesscence Rose Ikebana**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Hermes/Hermessence-Rose-Ikebana-2670.html)  
I wanted to love Rose de Chine, the notes seemed perfect for me, but there’s a burned plastic note I just can’t stand. Rose Ikebana is absolutely gorgeous, a totally unique rose with notes of Meyer lemon and red grape, but it’s possibly the shortest-lived thing I have ever smelled in my life. **Winner: Rose Ikebana**

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I am a single male. Never married and no kids and never want any of my own. This is reddit. We will likely never meet. Not even for a coffee even if I try to bribe you with home made pastries. I am sure my dry texting and one dimensional personality will do wonders for your insomnia. Would I like to date, yes, but let’s be realistic. Good conversation is probably the best we can ask for on reddit. I work from home and the weekly online DnD sessions aren’t really socially holding me over. 

Living on the west coast. Working one of those office jobs where I spend the day dreaming of making a living building furniture. I love music, and even play music. Maybe one day I will stop being a wuss and actually perform. NO. I don’t play DAD rock. So I will not talk your ear off about the importance of Punk Music or why some drummer is underrated. I am back in school, or more like I never really left. I am one of those people who take classes as a hobby. However I am trying to make a career change. I am a big fan of used book stores, thrift stores, galleries and museums. Yes, I have eReader but, a physical books just the business. If a cat or a dog comes up to me, I will pet it, if it let’s me. Does anyone like bird watching? Let’s find out once and for all if they ARE REAL or secret government drones. I workout and I actually enjoy it. I have my creatine and protein powder. I’m trying to learn Spanish. I am a workaholic at the moment as I am trying to make changes in my life. I see this ending soon and would like to travel and recreate more.  I haven’t had a passport in over a decade, I am severely under traveled, and I would like to change that. 

I am an atheist and very left learning. Just putting that out there for those in which this matters. I canvassed for Harris and have no shame in saying I’ve done so. I am pretty open and do not require you to be just like me. I care about the environment. Climate Change is indeed anthropogenic.  I have been trying to get more active and reached out to organizations like the Sierra Club. I am very atheist. Never “lost my faith” since I never had it. Am I terrified right now? Yes. I have lost sleep over current events and what the future may hold. 

What am I looking for. You? I am sure you’re pretty cool, fun and interesting. Drop in. Tell me about yourself. Tell me about something that excites or fascinates you. Again. Dry texter so bear with me. I kinda hate using my phone, hence the dry texting. Come at me with your book or podcast recommendations. Got volunteer or activism suggestions? Tell me. Voice chats are heavily encouraged. I am open to anything from one time chats all the way to dating. I am not trying to put pressure on anyone or micromanage our interactions. We have to see if we even can have a conversation before even thinking about stuff like meeting up.",1,1738895382.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1ijkh6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1ijkh6m/open_webui_governance_could_a_wordpressstyle/,Open WebUI Governance: Could a WordPress-Style Foundation Be The Secret Sauce?,"Alright people,

I been watching Open WebUI evolve, and frankly…it reminds me of the early days of WordPress (I’m old, it happens). Back then, it started as a humble blogging tool that eventually exploded into a major platform—thanks in large part to a community-driven governance model and even the formation of a foundation (peak at MAKE.WORDPRESS.ORG).

This got me thinking:

* **Formal Governance:** Would establishing a formal governance structure benefit Open WebUI’s long‑term growth, or would it stifle the flexibility that’s been key so far? Are there plans for this or something like this?
* **Leadership & Representation:** Should the project eventually adopt a model with a few dedicated public faces, rather than relying on a one‑man band? A true leadership team could be a boon. Tim is amazing, but even with dedicated committers he needs help on so many levels - formalizing it now would be a huge boon, IMHO.
* **Lessons from the Past:** What initial steps would make sense based on experiences from WordPress or other open‑source projects? Any cautionary tales or wins worth noting?

Look, I’m just a keyboard jockey that smashes keys for a living, but I’m convinced that if this project captures that early WordPress spirit—open collaboration, honest self‑criticism, and a dash of daring—it might just steer Open WebUI into something truly epic...well, it's already kind of epic - but you get the point.

Then again, maybe this is all being setup somewhere and I just haven't seen it yet-does anyone know?

Regardless, I'm curious how everyone sees the future of this project.

Where do you see it going? 

How do you see it getting there? 

And most importantly… coffee or tea?

Later taters,  
\-j

PS – Just so it’s clear, my ultimate goal is to see Open WebUI transform into an enterprise-level solution and for that I think there needs to be some formalization for it's future. I really believe there’s a lot to learn from WordPress—both the wins and the facepalms.

1ijkcw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1ijkcw7/my_friendship_is_a_zombie/,My friendship is a zombie.,"My ""friend"" became very possessive after I became close to a boy she introduced me to. She accused me of paying more attention to him than her, complained that I hugged him and not her, and that my hugs were ""a luxury one had to earn"". She said that I only spoke about him, that every time she tried to change the subject, I returned to him. That she was reconsidering our friendship because she was a third wheel and she didn't want to waste time. Thing is, that's not true at all. We were close. Very close. We jokingly called each other ""wife"", worked together in almost every assignment, held hands, told each other secrets and I even invited her to my home. I don't invite just anyone to my home because I'm not good with people. I'm always afraid that other people are going to hurt me. I don't hug people most of the time. The only reason I hugged that boy was because I was trying to make him feel welcome. He was shy, so I thought maybe he would feel more comfortable talking to someone he had stuff in common with (you know, because he was her friend and all). Besides, I hugged her all the time. Hell, many people even thought we were a couple. I was always focusing on her, my world revolved around her. She was always surrounded by friends of all kinds who talked to her about things that I didn't get, but I was happy to see that she had people who loved her. I was happy that she was not alone, that she had the love she deserved, because she had so much love to give. Yet I have one friend who is not her and she loses her crap. I apologized back then, for making her feel like she wasn't enough. I apologized and promised I would never make her feel like a third wheel, so I made sure to pay attention to her for weeks. She was the center of my universe. Everything I did, I thought of her. I stayed away from the boy, basically hid whatever signs of friendship we had and focused solely on her. I was basically her lapdog. The only time I allowed myself to speak with the boy was when we were going home. You know what's funny? Even after that, she posted vaguely in Instagram talking about friends who disappointed her and comparing me to a childhood friend she has that never did. She said she wanted distance. That she was not sore that I had other friends (except that she is, because her friends are not my friends so I didn't talk to them much). She said she wanted distance, yet when we saw each other again, she acted like nothing happened. She smiled, laughed, gave me hugs that I no longer wanted and talked to me about her hyperfixations. I tried talking to her about it, telling her how her possessiveness made me feel uncomfortable, and that it was unfair that I could not have friends when she had many. She turned it around on me, saying that I chose a man over her (I'm asexual), sending pictures of herself crying, telling me I needed to prove my friendship through actions and that she really didn't mind me having friends. 

Oh, and remember when I said she told me that I wouldn't stop talking about the boy? She said the same thing about a friend who left her. Now I wonder if she was telling the truth about that. The friend had asked her if they could get coffee and talk about what caused their friendship to fail, but when she told me about it, she said the ex-friend was ""begging her to be friends again"". I don't believe a word she says.

Just because I hug some people doesn't mean she's entitled to get hugs as well (even when I did give her hugs!)

Now I resent that she calls me ""wife"" because I feel more like an accessory than a person. She acts like I'm cheating on her too.

I hate that I let her be so close to me, because I forgot people can hurt other people easily. If I hadn't let her, this would not be happening.

I keep contact with the boy, but it still feels like I'm having to hide this friendship from her. 

Technically, we are still friends. She still acts like normal, even when she caused both the boy and me to have anxiety attacks. She still laughs, hugs me and talks to me about the things she likes. She said that she missed me a lot last time we saw each other, ""we haven't talked in a while"", she said. Even when I'm the one who's always messaging her. 

The only reason we're still friends is because I still need to finish working with her and I would rather make it bearable.

I'm so disillusioned on the concept on friendships recently. A part of me still thinks this is all on me, and that maybe I could have done better. Most of the friendships I've had were toxic, and I've been the common denominator. My family says this is not the case, as they've seen our friendship from the outside, but I just can't stop thinking about it. I'm so frustrated with her. I'm so mad at her and myself for not setting boundaries.

Jerrys GF has large pet lizards that frighten Jerry. They escape into Kramer's apt a la Jurassic Park. George dates a soldier for the free few months of deployment + goodbye/return sex but she never deploys. Elaine gets a virus on her BFs expensive computer,"Kramer starts to grow his own plants in the windowsill. He quickly graduates to more and more til he puts plastic up and turns his whole place into a greenhouse. He's always sweaty and wet but swears its good for his mental health and the home grown (tiny) veggies are worth it. He slowly spreads it to Jerrys too by putting plastic tubes between their places. ""We're just back and forth all the time, I couldn't afford to lose moisture every time I come over for a snack, or to go number 2, or to use your toothpaste"" ""...what? Are you in here when I'm gone?"" ""I thought we had an understanding!!""

Jerry dates a herpetologist with pet lizards that she claims are harmless but that constantly hiss at and bite Jerry. He is terrified of them.

George dates a female soldier. She keeps saying she's up for deployment. He loves the idea -- they date a few months at a time and right when things get serious, she goes across the world for up to 18 months after goodbye sex. He's single then she returns, they have return sex, and they're back to square 1. 

..except she never deploys. Something always comes up last minute - an injury, change in command, etc. George feels he's put in too much time and if she is deployed they will try long distance and he'll be celibate again until she returns. 

Elaine dates a wealthy IT guy. He leaves his computer (custom built, >$5,000) open when he goes to work. He asks her to just ""lock up on your way out"". She lounges, makes coffee, and then tries to do some online shopping on his computer. Instead she downloads a virus and thinks she's destroyed his baby.

 Jerry's GF goes out of town (upsetting George because she's ""deploying"" on a herpetological conference for a week and his GF is constantly with him). He watches the lizards as she brings them in their tanks to his place (""they're so social! They need company!"" As they lunge at Jerry)

When feeding one a mouse it leaps at him and he knocks the glass over. All of them escape into the jungle-like apartments and ""hunt"" Jerry and Kramer, who need to make their way to the A/C thermostat to lower the temperature and get the lizards tired and lethargic to catch them.
