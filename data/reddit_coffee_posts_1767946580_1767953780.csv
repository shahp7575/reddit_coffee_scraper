I’m a neurodivergent (Dyspraxic) bisexual male in Scotland who has a bigger preference with guys as I don’t see myself dating girls but I am attracted to them. I’ve been unlucky with dating recently. I've graduated from full time education. I came out 8 years ago in high school and I tried dating apps twice… and didn’t like it. Tinder, bumble & hinge. I often feel like I was always trying to impress people and a guy got annoyed at me as he wanted to meet up for a coffee date & then moaned at me saying I didn’t want to go when he never set up a date for it. Plus lots of guys online don’t care about dating I’ve realised in the LGBT community.

I’ve also been unlucky with guys. All the guys who have been attracted in irl to me are bisexual men or in the closet. The first guy from my year in uni, ghosted me after moving away despite calling me ‘cool’ and us speaking for weeks. We met up a few months ago accidentally and he was awkward around me. The second guy flirted with me, asked me on a date. Showed me all the signs and turned out he had a secret girlfriend the whole time. I had to go to therapy but I’m all good now. The third one was the best one. He was a tall handsome guy that I didn’t expect to fall in love with. He would always be gentle with me, we shared lots of interests & humour. He would often stare at me in my retail work and touch my arm. I invited him out to the movies as he was saying he wanted to go to the movies for the second time to see a movie. He & I loved and he got awkward around me when I said I could go with him. He had an LDR girlfriend and I understood that boundary. But wanted to stay friends with him.

A few months later he moved back to Australia for job opportunities. He got upset when he left the job as I wasn't working his last day and sent me a paragraph saying how amazing & incredible I was. On his leaving party, he got drunk and hugged me a lot. Plus told me what perfume he wore and kept aggressively tapping my arm. We spoke for a few weeks telling me his dreams & ambitions. He would send me long paragraphs but we stopped talking. After that, he would send blue hearts. As he had sent red hearts before that. 

The most recent one was a guy at my new bank job. I’m unsure of his sexuality. He told me on his first day his twin is better looking than he is and I caught him glance at me a few times. I didn’t know what to say as I’m new at my job. And don’t want to make the wrong impression. Plus he shook my hand. But he’s just being nice properly. I came across his instagram and we have a few mutual friends but haven’t followed due to only working one shift with him. He’s a good looking guy and I want him to feel better about himself. 

Is there anything else I can do better?? I always ask questions about the person, I’m confident and passionate. I’ve been told I’m nice & attractive guy. A guy who is seven years younger than me is attractive to me in retail work but I’m not interested as we are in different stages of life.",1,1767953686.0,UKrelationshipadvice,0,1.0,False
1q84l66,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1q84l66/from_passing_out_over_needles_to_selfinjecting/,From passing out over needles to self-injecting without hesitation (AutoJect experience),"I want to share this in case it helps even one person who’s terrified of needles like I was.

I was deathly afraid of needles. Full panic mode. I’m the guy who would pass out at the doctor’s office getting a simple shot. The idea of injecting myself? Nope. Couldn’t even imagine it.

But I knew two things:
	1.	I had to get over this fear
	2.	I needed to lose weight and actually take my health seriously

After a ton of research, I found this auto-injector that works with insulin needles:
👉 https://amzn.to/3L6B4aT

Quick honesty note: that Amazon link is a commission link. I literally make about 1% if someone buys it — basically enough for a fraction of a coffee — but I stand by this thing 100%.

Week 1 / Shot #1:
Even with the AutoJect loaded, I sat there for almost two hours staring at it, working up the courage. Hands shaking. Finally said, “Okay, I have to do this.”

Injected into my stomach and… nothing. No pain. No sensation at all.

I looked at my husband and said, “I did it!! I think…”
I opened the AutoJect, pulled the syringe out, and saw the medication was gone. It worked. I actually did it. I felt like I just beat a final boss.

Today / Shot #2:
Loaded everything up. Switched sides from last week. Didn’t overthink it. Pressed it in, clicked the button, held for 10 seconds — done. Zero hesitation.

I know this sounds like a sales post, but it’s genuinely not. I’m sharing because I know there are people out there who want to improve their health but are completely paralyzed by needle fear.

Also full transparency: I had AI rewrite this post because I suck at writing and ramble 😅

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the kicker: **You probably already have more than you realize—you’re just not putting it to work.**

Most of us leave money sitting in savings accounts earning *peanuts* (like, literal pennies) when it could be growing into something way bigger. Imagine if your coffee fund could one day pay for your coffee *and* your vacation. That’s the power of making your money work for you.

### **3 Signs You’re Leaving Money on the Table**
✅ **Your savings account is a ""just in case"" graveyard** – If your emergency fund is just… sitting there, it’s slowly losing value to inflation. (Yes, even ""high-yield"" accounts often can’t keep up.)
✅ **You’re waiting for ""someday"" to invest** – Newsflash: ""Someday"" is a myth. The best time to start was yesterday. The second-best? Today.
✅ **You think ""investing"" means gambling on meme stocks** – Spoiler: It doesn’t. Smart investing is about steady growth, not overnight riches.

### **The Simple Fix? Put Your Money in Motion**
You don’t need a finance degree to grow your wealth. You just need to **start**. Here’s how:
- **Automate it** – Set up small, regular transfers to an investment account. Even $50/month adds up *fast*.
- **Diversify like a boss** – Don’t put all your eggs in one basket (or one stock). Spread it out.
- **Use tools that do the heavy lifting** – Why guess when you can let tech handle the math?

**Pro tip:** [You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb) (Affiliate link—because sharing good tools is just good karma.)

### **The Bottom Line**
Money isn’t just about what you *have*—it’s about what you *do* with it. So ask yourself: **Are you letting your savings collect dust, or are you turning it into something bigger?**

*Drop a 💰 if you’re ready to make your money work harder. (No pressure—just food for thought.)*",1,1767953605.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some of the things my partner and i did back in may 2024 to seriously drop our monthly bills. we were feeling the pinch and realized small changes really do add up to hundreds of dollars saved.  
  
the first thing we did was look at our big fixed costs. we went through every single subscription and streaming service. honestly, we were paying for hulu, netflix, disney+, and paramount plus. we cut three of them and only kept the one we used most. same with a gym membership i hadn't used since january. that alone saved us like 80 bucks a month. also, call your insurance, phone, and internet companies. i switched my car insurance provider and saved almost $40 a month instantly. don't be afraid to ask for a better deal or threaten to switch.  
  
for day-to-day, groceries were a huge target. planning is key. i check my pantry and fridge first and build my list around what needs to be used up to stop wasting food. i only shop sales and use store-brand for staples like rice, beans, and canned goods—it’s way cheaper than name brands. always check the unit price on the shelf label, because sometimes the smaller package is actually a better deal than the bulk size.  
  
energy and utilities are another big win. we switched all our bulbs to led, which is a one-time cost but seriously cuts down on electricity use over time. we also got into the habit of washing all our clothes in cold water. apparently, 90 percent of the energy from laundry is just for heating the water. make sure to unplug things like tv boxes, coffee makers, and phone chargers when you aren't using them because they are 'vampire' appliances and still suck up power.  
  
finally, if you have any extra space like a driveway or an empty garage that you dont use all the time, consider listing it on prked. it's a super easy way to make passive income just by renting out that unused space to people who need convenient and cheap parking nearby. the money you earn from that can easily offset your rising utility or grocery bills. its a simple passive side hustle.  
  
hope this helps a few people looking to cut down their bills this month.",1,1767953553.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q84jor,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1q84jor/i_helped_a_stranger_pick_an_interview_outfit_and/,"I helped a stranger pick an interview outfit, and months later she saved my worst day","A few months ago, I was killing time at a thrift store after work, doing that slow, aimless browsing you do when you’re too tired to go straight home.

I had my headphones around my neck and my tote bag on my shoulder, and I guess from a distance I looked like I worked there.

Because this woman walks up to me in the blazer aisle and goes really quiet.

Hi… sorry, do you work here?

I should’ve said no, but my brain did that thing where it tries to be helpful before it tries to be honest, so I just said,

Uh… what do you need?

She exhales like she’s been holding her breath for an hour.

I have an interview tomorrow. I haven’t done one in years. I don’t even know what I’m supposed to look like anymore.

She wasn’t dramatic, just embarrassed. Like asking for help was the part that hurt.

So I said Okay, show me what you’re considering.

She had three options: a blazer that swallowed her whole, a blouse that looked like it had survived a war, and a dress that was actually cute, but she kept tugging at the sleeves like she didn’t trust it.

We stood there for maybe fifteen minutes doing the world’s least official fashion consultation. I asked where the interview was, what kind of role, and what she wanted to feel like walking in.

She blinked. Like I’m allowed to be there.

That line hit me so hard I almost pretended my phone rang.

We built something simple: the dress, the blazer that fit her shoulders, shoes that didn’t look like they hated her. When she came out of the fitting room, her posture changed first, and then her face caught up. She looked at herself in the mirror and gave this tiny smile as she surprised herself.

Then she turned to me. Thank you, seriously. You have no idea.

And then she pointed at my tote bag. So… do you get a discount?

I laughed. I don’t work here. I’m just a woman with strong opinions about blazers, apparently.

Her whole face cracked open, she laughed so hard she had to cover her mouth, and she hugged me right there by the clearance rack.

I figured that was a sweet, weird little moment.

Then last week happened.

Last week was one of those weeks where everything stacked alarm didn’t go off, spilled coffee on my shirt, and my boss hit me with a quick chat that was not quick. By the time I got off the bus, I was holding it together with pure spite and mascara.

I stop at a corner shop to buy bread and something unhealthy, and I’m standing in line staring at nothing, trying not to cry in public.

And I hear this voice behind me:

No way. Blazer Girl?

I turn around. It’s her. Same eyes, same smile, different energy. She looks lighter, like she’s not bracing for impact anymore.

She goes, Thrift store. Interview outfit. You told me the shoulders were the whole point? 

My brain goes blank. Oh my god… yes, hi.

She’s holding a basket filled with everyday happy things, including fruit, tea, and some fancy chocolate. She looks at my face for two seconds. “Bad day?”

I try to say 'no,' but my voice betrays me. She doesn’t make it a big deal, reaches into her basket, pulls out the chocolate bar, and sets it on the conveyor belt like it’s the most normal thing in the world.

What are you doing?

Paying you back.

I start to protest. She cuts me off. You don’t get to argue. You helped me feel like I was allowed to be in the room, remember?

Then she leans in. I got the job.

I felt this warm drop in my chest, like relief for someone else can fix parts of you.

We walked out together for a minute while cars went by. She told me she still has the outfit, wore it on her first day, and kept hearing my voice: “Shoulders. You’ve got this.

Then she said something that made me laugh, even though my eyes were still wet:

I’m not good at thanking people in a normal way, so I made a rule. If I see someone on the edge of a bad day, I do one small thing that makes it less sharp. Today… you’re the small thing.

We went our separate ways. No dramatic music, no movie ending. Just a stranger turning a terrible day into a survivable one.

hey everyone so i was figuring out how we're gonna pay for our big summer road trip next july and i thought i'd share some of the things i found that go way beyond just ""save your money""  
  
the first thing is to straight up hustle a little for extra cash. i'm talking about selling everything you don't need on facebook marketplace or ebay. seriously go through your garage and closets. we made like $400 last month just from old toys and camping gear. you can also look into bank account bonuses or credit card sign-up bonuses. some banks will give you $200-$400 just for opening a new checking account and meeting a minimum deposit or direct deposit. just make sure you read the fine print and don't pay any fees.  
  
another great passive income stream if you have extra room is to rent out unused space. this is where prked comes in handy. if you have an extra spot in your driveway, a garage you don't use, or even a storage unit you can list it on prked. it's an easy setup and the money is completely passive. you set your own price and schedule. we're doing this with our driveway space while we're on vacation and it helps cover the gas money for the whole trip.  
  
for travel costs, you really gotta get into travel hacking. look for credit cards with great sign-up bonuses for travel points or miles. a big bonus can cover a couple of economy flights right off the bat, especially if you have a family of four or more. also, use cash-back sites like rakuten for all your online shopping, even for groceries or clothes, and just funnel that cash back right into your vacation fund. for hotels, focus on getting points for free nights since trying to get four business class seats with points is often way too hard for families.  
  
finally, set up a dedicated savings account for the trip and put it on autopilot. set an automatic transfer of $25 or $50 every week to go into that account so you never even see the money. then get the kids involved. we made a jar decorated with pictures of the beach and all our spare change and money from cancelled subscriptions (hulu, that extra music app) goes into the jar. cutting out one $5 coffee a day for a month is $150 right there. it adds up so fast.  
  
hope this helps some other families get on the road or to the beach.",1,1767953434.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

He said he joined this club, so I went to the club as well. They took 900 rupees for 3 days and made me drinnk a herbal tea and a shake.

Now they didn't disclose the name or anything just gave me the shake amnd it tasted pretty okay.

Then the so callled 'nutritionist' asked me to join a zoom meeting for giving tips and tricks. The meeting pretty much explained how we can sell the product oursleves and earn good money, I sensed some MLM type shit right there. They did the mistake of revealing the company name : Herbal life.

It took me one Reddit search to find out I was literally being seved poison this whole time. After drinking the 'replacement meal' I got palpitations and constantly felt a high , like I drank 3-4 cups of coffee in one day.

Anyways I contacted this 'expert' and told him that I had a knee pain and I spent a good chunk of money there so if he could refund me the money I paid in advance, he declined it.

He asked for about 7k for a month and I paid him 3.5 k telling him I will pay the second half later on.

If only I could have gotten the name of the brand in the first 3 day trial I would have never looked back. Now I am planning an exit strategy. For instance there is this girl who comes in to learn whatever the expert has to say. He does say some useful things though and packages it with the drink. She takes the drink in a bottle claiming to drink it after her workout.

I could do the same for next 10 - days come home and simply throw away the drink

OR

just go after them , take the drink home , send it for testing which will ofcourse reveal the toxic ingridients it has, report it to the police and raise awareness.

I asked my family members and they said the first option is much more reliable and less risky or the better option would be to not go at all.

My sibling/partner/friend is graduating from nursing school soon, and I’ve been trying to find a gift that actually *feels personal* — not just another generic gift card or flowers.

I’ve seen a bunch of lists with practical stuff like scrubs or coffee tumblers, but I wanted something *sentimental* that also relates to their new career as a nurse. A few people in other groups mentioned **nursing graduation gift necklaces** — especially the ones with stethoscope designs — and it really resonated with me. According to multiple gift guides, a custom stethoscope necklace can be a meaningful way to celebrate a nursing grad’s achievement, since it symbolizes their entry into the profession and can be worn proudly.

Here are a few reasons I like this idea:

✨ **Personalized and meaningful** — a necklace with their name or initials feels way more thoughtful than generic jewelry.  
✨ **Symbolic of their journey** — the stethoscope is *such* an iconic nurse tool, so wearing it as a piece of jewelry feels proud and professional.  
✨ **Gift buyers actually choose this for graduation** — I saw many nursing graduation gift guides recommend it alongside practical essentials.

If you’re in the same boat and want something that feels special *and* relevant, this is a good resource I found with **personalized stethoscope name necklaces** — perfect for RN graduation gifts:

1q84gzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q84gzv/how_to_turn_seasonal_tourist_crowds_into_easy/,how to turn seasonal tourist crowds into easy side hustle cash,"  
  
hey everyone i figured i'd share some ideas for making extra money if you live in a popular spot that gets hit with seasonal visitors or big events like football games or concerts. there's so much cash floating around during peak season, you just need a way to grab some of it.  
  
one of the easiest things is to monetize space you aren't using. this is super passive. if you have an extra driveway, a garage spot, or even a side lot, you can list it on an app like prked. it's perfect for hosts because you get passive income from a spot that was just sitting there. the setup is really easy, you list your space in minutes, set your own price and schedule, and manage it all in the app.  
  
for the parkers, they are happy because they get closer, more convenient parking on private property, which feels safer than some random lot. they can skip the parking chaos and long lines after an event, plus it’s often way cheaper than official venue parking. hosts have even been known to clear snow or give clear directions for stress-free arrival. it's a win-win.  
  
beyond the parking side, think about high-demand services for tired tourists.  
  
if you're into short-term rentals, listing a spare room or your whole place on airbnb or vrbo during the high season is a massive income booster. just make sure you check your local rules. an alternative to that is offering ""airbnb turnover"" cleaning and restocking services for other hosts in your area. they always need fast, reliable help.  
  
service-based hustles are huge too. consider seasonal work like being a tour guide for a few hours a week—walking tours, food tours, or niche history tours pay great tips. or get a gig at a local restaurant or catering company that's swamped with tourists. bartenders especially can make a small fortune in tips during peak times.  
  
for the digital side, you can sell your knowledge. if you know your city well, create a hyper-specific ebook or a custom digital itinerary on a topic like ""the 5 best non-touristy coffee shops near the beach"" or ""local-only hiking trails."" people pay for that insider info. you can also get into freelance social media management for local vacation rental businesses who need help handling their peak-season bookings and guest communication.  
  
hope this helps you figure out a hustle for your town's next big rush.",1,1767953191.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

hey, so i figured i'd share a few thoughts on how to actually cash in on living near a cool vacation area. it’s not all about full-on airbnbs, there are a lot of smaller ways to leverage that location.  
  
first off, if you have any extra space at all, that's immediate cash. for people who visit big tourist areas, parking is always a nightmare. if you have an empty driveway, garage, or even a grassy spot, you can list it on prked. it's an app for renting your parking/storage space nearby, and it’s way easier and more passive than a full short-term rental. you just list the space and collect the money. hosts get passive income and set their own prices and schedules. for the tourists, they get vip parking that's usually closer and they feel safer since it’s on someone’s private property.  
  
if you have a separate unit or maybe you can crash with friends sometimes, short-term rentals are the biggest earner. think airbnb or vrbo. even just renting out a spare room. remember to check local laws first, they can be tricky. make sure your listing is unique and highlight the proximity to the main attraction.  
  
for side hustles, you don’t need much. tourists always need local knowledge. you could become a part-time tour guide on the weekends. think super specific, like a 'best hidden coffee shops' walking tour or a 'local history' talk. you can list these as experiences on platforms like airbnb or just advertise locally.  
  
another good one is running simple delivery services. tourists don’t want to leave their rental to grab groceries or run errands. you could do food delivery or offer a luggage storage service for people who arrive early or have a late flight and need a place to stash their bags for a few hours.  
  
if you're into photography, offer quick 30-minute photo shoots at the most scenic spots. people love professional photos for their social media from their trip. or if you're a good writer, you could even become a freelance travel writer for blogs or local tourism sites, since you have insider knowledge of the destination.  
  
the key is to solve a problem for a tourist. they need parking, accommodation, a fun thing to do, or someone to run an errand. whatever your space or skill is, there’s a way to monetize it.

I got 4-5 family users, so the free personal plan is out I believe (3 users max). Although I keep seeing posts here where people say they use the free tier for their family of 4 or more.

hey all, figured i’d share some tips if you live near a big tourist spot or venue like a stadium or theme park. you’re literally sitting on a goldmine of earning opportunities beyond just a standard airbnb. i’m talking about actual side hustles that make money off the constant visitor traffic without having to run a full business.  
  
the absolute easiest passive income stream is your parking. think about it, tourists hate paying those crazy lot fees and circling forever to park. if you have an unused driveway, garage, or even an empty grass patch, list it on an app like prked. it's seriously easy to list your space, you can set your own price and schedule, and it turns that idle space into quick cash. a spot near a beach or concert hall is prime real estate and it's way cheaper for the driver, and you get passive income flowing right from your phone. you can even rent out storage space for their extra gear, like surfboards or snow skis, through the app.  
  
beyond parking, you can leverage your local knowledge. consider offering a niche tour. instead of the main stuff, run a ""hidden gems"" walking tour, a local brewery/food truck crawl, or even a sunset photography guide. you can also rent out gear—think bikes, paddleboards, beach chairs, or coolers—to save visitors the hassle of bringing their own or buying new stuff.  
  
for the digital side, your location is your content. take high-quality photos and drone footage of the local scenery and sell them on stock photo sites. you can also write an e-book or a hyper-specific digital guide for your area, like ""the 5 best coffee shops with wi-fi for digital nomads"" or ""dog-friendly trails near \[hotspot name\]"". once it's made, it’s pure passive income.  
  
finally, if you have a little extra space, consider a small, low-effort rental. you don't need a whole house. maybe a tiny bnb, a glamping tent in your backyard, or even a basic homestay if zoning allows. this is more effort but the demand for non-hotel lodging is super high near attractions. just remember to check your local city and hoa rules before diving into short-term rentals, but parking spots are almost always good to go.

1q84aoe,https://i.redd.it/t8w6xouiqacg1.png,"💡 According to the Wall Street Journal, GEO is already an industry worth tens of billions of dollars.","Looking back at Black Friday, a few numbers clearly show the scale of this new search channel.

– Traffic coming from ChatGPT has increased **8x in one year** on major e-commerce sites, representing nearly **200,000 visits** across the platforms analyzed.  
– AI Search alone could **double the value of the search ecosystem within five years**.  
– Today, SEO represents around **$81 billion**.  
– By 2030, **SEO + GEO combined could reach $171 billion**.

This growth won’t happen by magic. It will come from massive investments, acquisitions, equity stakes, tooling, and infrastructure — ultimately benefiting publishers, brands, and the wider ecosystem.

Unsurprisingly, everyone is now launching tools to measure visibility across LLM-based engines:  
AI-native SaaS platforms, traditional search players, and agencies — including Eskimoz.

That said, some fundamental challenges remain:

– No one has access to real prompt volumes. ChatGPT would be well advised to release a Search Console-like product or at least an API endpoint for this data.  
– Since nearly every prompt is unique, the idea of “top queries” doesn’t really apply to GEO. Do we need to work on thousands of prompts? Semantic clusters? Search intent spectra?  
– My main hypothesis: by introducing friction into measurement (no clear volumes, very few clicks), GEO will gradually pull marketing teams out of the *everything-must-be-measured* mindset that has dominated for the past decade.

And I’m willing to bet marketing leaders will adapt.

Today, we measure everything — poorly.  
Tomorrow, we’ll measure less — but better.

They had spooky shit and a saw mill too. However, I don’t think ours is owned by a smokeshow from Hong Kong. I don’t really know who owns it. Probably the Shriner family honestly. They own most of the town anyway.

How far can I get? We shall see. 

**Sunday, August 10th, 6:00 pm**

Just me, my saffron latte and a basement of microfiche films against the world today. But I did learn a few things.

 First, how to use microfiche.

Second, I was right. The mill is owned by the Shriner family. Specifically, it was owned by Franklin and their cousin Alan, the one who worked with Rooter on the mall deal. Both basically disappeared after the whole incident. It’s the only shared property in the family but it was divided weirdly. So the building, the equipment and the trees are all owned by Franklin. But the land itself is owned by Alan. He built the mall on a patch that had been clear cut by Franklin. They had a spat to put it nicely, and it got really ugly. When the mill burned, Franklin suspected Alan, but disappeared before anything really came out of it. When the family decided to push off the mall opening, Alan vanished too so they decided to keep it closed to save face. 

So:

Ok, next, the mill itself. The saw mill was built in 1900, and was the first major job producer in the area. Built by Albiticus Shriner, who was a bit of a cornball to say the least. Despite being a heavily Catholic area surrounding his mill, he was a follower of Aleister Crowley. That’s right folks, the sexual deviant master of debauchery himself. Now, I don’t quite understand how he got into this, but after following the master of disaster’s teachings for a while he started his own church. 

I know, I know, how on the nose. A cult founded small town. OooOOOooo

But when he started his own church, he started praying to the forest that surrounded the mill. He preached about a figure named Divicianna. He didn’t continue the sexual deviancy of Crowley, so he gets a few brownie points.  

Divicianna blessed the woods to grow strong and fast as long as she was respected. Remember the other day when I said there’s something special about our lumber? It’s not the lumber, it’s the trees themselves. They’re related to red oak trees but they’ve mutated to grow to full height within ten years without sucking all the life out of the dirt. So, they’re constantly producing trees fit for lumber without absolutely nuking the forest. 

Albiticus somehow knew these trees were special and decided to build his mill here. It was a small endeavor to begin with, basically a camp with 20 men and their families in tents. People settled in 1903 and our cozy little town was born.  Come 1910, the singular religious establishment was a one room church for Divicianna, built from her own trees. She is Divincianna. He paid for a statue to be built in bronze for her in the center of town. So that’s four more checked off our list and one added.

**Monday, August 11th, 3:23 am**

Someone was in my house. 

I’m waiting outside for the police and Ian, Demeter is confused but content being asleep tucked in my robe. 

I thought I was having a nightmare at first, but the shadowy remnants of those always disappear when I open my eyes. This one didn’t.

I was asleep on the couch after that old movie marathon they had airing last night, having my usual nightmare when something in my dream started to beg me to wake up. This gentle feminine voice was pleading that I needed to wake up, but be totally still or I was going to get hurt. Somehow, I managed to pull myself awake and do just that. I opened my eyes, but I stayed totally still. A black figure snuck past the couch by my feet and headed for my room. I heard them opening drawers and shuffling around for something. I pulled my phone out and lowered my brightness before they noticed. Or they didn’t respond to it I guess. I fired off a message to Ian, Cami, and Markus telling them to call the police, and there was someone in my room. Markus responded first with a thumbs up. 

The intruder must have found what they were looking for, because as soon as I hid my phone again, they stepped out of my room and headed for the front door. They must of had a sense of humor because they tiptoed across the room like the pink panther, I could almost hear the music score. They slipped out the door as quickly as they came in, leaving black boot prints behind. 

You can trace their every step from whatever powder was on their boots, but it never seems to get lighter. Like the powder was being wiped off as they stepped you know? They were just solid black. 

I don’t know what they took. I don’t know who they are. I don’t know. There’s the sheriff now. Will update when I can. 

 

**Monday, August 11th, 12:00 pm**

Nothing productive came out of the police. I wish I could be surprised but I’m too pissed to care. They dusted for prints, took some photos and collected some residue from the footprints. 

Ian however, was more than helpful. I’m currently sitting on his couch actually. Demeter is in his window, yelling at his bird feeder. 

He showed up about twenty minutes after the cops, still in his jammies and very disleveled. De and I crawled into his car, and I filled him in. He wasn’t exactly one with the earth, so I ended up repeating myself until he got it. Once he gained sentience, he offered me an assumed cigarette, and stepped out to talk to the cops. I don’t smoke, but I took it anyway and lit it. You know what’s funny though? Big, strong, basement ghost beating Ian smokes tea and weed packed into stuff-your-own-cigarettes tubes. Love that for him. I might buy some off him. 

So he talks to the cops for a little while, then returns to the car and we pull out. 

“We’ll head home, you and De can take my bed and in the morning we’ll go to the city and get some cameras and a new lock. How’s that sound?” He leans back in his seat, and holds out a hand to take my roll-your-own. I offer it to him and nod, glancing at De asleep in the back seat, all curled up in her carrier. 

Don’t smoke and drive kids. Park, like a decent degenerate. 

We pulled into his place, or his mom’s old place I should say and toddle inside. He and his mother lived in the renovated carriage house on the Shriner property and when he was old enough, he moved back in after she died. It’s a large apartment above a workshop basically, but it’s well kept and still more lux then half the high end apartments in Chicago. He takes Demeter so I can tackle the stairs, and cracks the crate open for her. She slithers out and looks around, knowing her buddy is around somewhere. 

Ian keeps a huge pet rabbit, freestyling in his house. I’m talking massive. He’s a Flemish giant named Bruno, that’s litter trained and likes to follow De around like a pining lover. I’ve kept our big eared friend over the years when Ian goes on vacation, so we’re all well acquainted. 

They greet each other, and I head off to Ian’s room to try and sleep, the fuzzbuckets both on my tail. 

No matter how hard I tried and how tired I was, I didn’t really sleep. I’d nod off just far enough to start to dream and jerk awake, seeing that guy rummaging through my house and smelling rotted wood or swamp. Just something plantlike and decaying. When I heard Ian up and kicking around, I crawled out of bed. The critters were curled up together on the floor, Demeter snoring away as usual.

We had coffee and another roll-your-own in silence before he finally spoke up. 

“Any more ghost pipe screams?” He ashes the joint, almost into his mug might I add. 

“Nope… a little dust here and there though. Did the cops tell you anything?” 

He shook his head and sighs, then offered it over. “Not a thing… but we’ll get cameras up in case they come back.” 

I take a swig of my coffee, the thought of a return visit terrifying me. Instead, I decide to change the subject and nod to the joint in his hand. “When did this start?” 

“Ah… at eighteen or so?… The car accident messed up my whole…” he waves a hand over his left shoulder, collarbone, neck and head. “So I spent a few years on antidepressants and pain pills but they got to be a problem… I was uh…  by sixteen, I was addicted to oxys… and I was a hellion about it. But those get to be pretty hard to come by in a small town. I moved onto cheaper…more readily available things…” He pushes his sleeve up, showing a handful of pinpoint scars up his forearm. “So… the Ol man notices some silver forks missing before a big gala… he sat me down and told me I’m either going to get my shit together, or I’m going to get out without a dime of my inheritance. I got combative, and after a brief…” he snorts and shakes his head, then takes a slow drawl off his joint. “Basically, he whopped my ass and told me I had five minutes to pack because I was either going to a rehab program or I was out on my ass. I took him up on the rehab. Spent six months in a treatment center and the day I was released, we get T-boned on the way home. I break my collarbone all over again. That one ends up in surgery, and I rawdogged recovery. Not even a Tylenol…” 

At this point he moves his collar to show a neat little scar on his chest. 

“That was miserable but I was so scared of getting bad again, I wasn’t risking it. Well… you know Mrs. Robichaux? Yeah, she came over one day to drop off something to the Ol man and she sees me. Without a word, she opens this little case in her purse and offers me one of these. Says there’s a little cannabis in it, but it’s more herbs than herb.” He ashes the rollie again and takes another pull. “Took the pain away… helped the swelling… allowed me to function…all the good things. So I’ve been buying from her for years now. The Ol’ man might know but he hasn’t said anything about my California sober lifestyle. I haven’t touched pills in seven years… I don’t drink… just this. Twice a day, as prescribed by Mrs. Robichaux.” 

I raise my mug to him before finishing my coffee. He passes it off, and puts our mugs in the sink before tootling off down the hall without a word. A few moments pass before I hear the shower kick on. 

I finish the last little bit of the joint before heading to the living room to wait. 

My dear reader, at this moment I realized I couldn’t go with him to the hardware store unless he took me home first. I’m still in my pajamas. I can’t wear Blinky the fish boxers and a hole filled t-shirt to the hardware. My robe doesn’t pass for anything close to trench coat like.  I didn’t even have shoes. When I ran out of the house, I just grabbed Demeter and her carrier. 

 

Ian however, was cool about letting me stay here while he ran errands if I’d feed Bruno for him when he got up. A fair deal right? I think that’s him pulling in now. I’ve gotta get De back in her carrier before we can leave. ",1,1767951968.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

У меня есть варианты в сфере автозапчастей, парфюмерии, шампуней, дезодорантов, сапбордов и других туристических товаров, кофе напрямую от производителя, краска как для заборов, так и для автомобилей (я уже нашёл несколько поставщиков, которые предлагают такие товары), а также импорт сладостей из других стран. Я также рассматривал продажу угля оптом и, помимо основного направления, дополнительное — розничную продажу одежды и электроники (сразу уточню, что продавать лично я не буду; уже есть люди, которые будут продавать за меня, а я буду только контролировать процесс и помогать, если у них возникнут проблемы).

Также я думал помочь другу с его Telegram-магазином, который продаёт звёзды, и у него же есть услуга пополнения Steam по очень выгодному курсу (в некоторые моменты даже ниже, чем в самом приложении Steam). Я пишу сюда, потому что у меня много идей и я примерно понимаю, как их реализовать, но пока не знаю, с чего начать.

Забыл упомянуть, что помимо автозапчастей я буду продавать шины, диски, автомобильную краску и химию для салона автомобиля (химию я буду продавать компаниям, которые ею пользуются и которым она необходима). Я буду продавать товары тем, кому они действительно нужны.



I have options in auto parts, perfumes, shampoos, deodorants, SUP boards and other tourism-related products, coffee directly from a manufacturer, paint both for fences and for cars (I have already found several suppliers who offer such products), and importing sweets from other countries. I have also considered selling coal wholesale, and in addition to the main direction, having a secondary one — selling clothing and electronics at retail (I want to clarify right away that I will not be selling personally; there are already people who will sell on my behalf, and I will only supervise and help if problems arise).

I have also thought about helping a friend with his Telegram store that sells stars, and he also offers a Steam top-up service at very favorable rates (at certain times even lower than in the Steam app itself). I am writing here because I have many ideas and roughly understand how to implement them, but I do not yet know where to start.

I forgot to mention that in addition to auto parts, I will be selling tires, wheels, car paint, and interior car chemicals (the chemicals will simply be sold to companies that use them and need them). I will be selling products to those who actually need them.

If you’re currently staring at your bank balance and wondering where December went, here’s a low-effort way to make back thirty bucks.

Ubank is running a referral deal where we both get **$30** if you sign up and do the bare minimum. I’m sharing this here because I’ve used them for ages, and since we Reddit friends are all navigating the post-Christmas financial wreckage, I figure we’re close enough to mates for the sake of a sign-up mates bonus.

**The $30 ""Jan-Tax"" Rebate**

1. Grab the ubank app and use the code **9NXTQV1** when it asks about you during sign-up.
2. Tap your card (or phone) **5 times** within the first 30 days.
3. *The trick:* You don't need a massive deposit. Five small transactions—like buying five separate coffees or scanning five individual groceries—triggers the payout.

**The Catch on their high interest (read this before you commit)** Ubank is great, but they changed the rules recently for their high interest account and it’s a bit of a trap if you’re not paying attention. To get the **4.35% interest rate** (5.10% for the first four months):

* **Crucially,** you have to grow your savings balance by at least **$1** every month (and they don’t count the interest they pay you as ""growth"").
* If you treat your savings like a revolving door and it doesn’t go up by that gold coin, the interest rate drops off a cliff. It’s a hoop, so only go for it if you're the type to actually track that stuff.

**Why bother?** Aside from the free thirty, it’s a brand of NAB and has the **Government $250k guarantee**, so it’s a proper bank. There are no account fees, and it’s one of the few cards that doesn't charge you a ""convenience fee"" for using an ATM or buying stuff while you're overseas.

1q842ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1q842ep/my_daughters_fitness_tracker_recorded_her_last/,My daughter's fitness tracker recorded her last moments.,"The last photo my daughter sent me was of fog.



Not the soft kind that rolls off the river in the morning; this was thick and pale like breath on glass, caught between the trees. She’d framed it so the trail disappeared into whiteness. In the bottom corner, the tip of her boot was visible, muddied at the seam, as if she’d stepped into something that didn’t want to let go.



Caption: “Perfect weather. Feels like the world’s holding its breath.”



I replied with a heart and told her to be careful. I asked if she’d brought enough water. I asked if she’d told anyone which trail she was doing. The usual mother questions you ask when your child is an adult and you’re trying to pretend you have a say in anything anymore.



She “loved” my message and didn’t answer.



That was my first mistake, thinking the little heart meant she’d seen it and that was enough.



In the Smokies, silence is never just silence. It’s the trees swallowing sound. It’s the way the mountains keep what you bring into them.



Maya had been hiking since she was a teenager. She called it her therapy. Her office job left her wired, jaw tight, eyes always looking past you like she was scanning for the next email. Hiking was the only thing that seemed to turn her into herself again. When she moved back home after her lease ended, she started doing the national park on weekends. She’d drive down early, get coffee, send me a selfie with her hood up and her earbuds in, and then vanish into the green.



I didn’t love it, not in the way you love something safe. I loved that she loved it. I loved how calm she was afterward. I hated the park’s size, the way its trails looked orderly on maps but felt endless in reality, like veins branching into a body too large to understand. I’d read the missing person stories, the ones that always started with “experienced hiker” and ended with “search suspended.”



So I bought her the tracker.



It was meant to be a compromise. A bracelet, sleek and black, something modern and reassuring. It counted steps, tracked heart rate, mapped routes, recorded elevation. It let you share your activity with friends. It synced to her phone automatically. She laughed when I gave it to her.



“You’re trying to turn me into data,” she said, rolling her eyes.



“Just wear it,” I told her. “Humor me.”



She wore it.



That’s the cruel part. She did what I asked.



On the day she disappeared, the weather was mild for October. Cool enough for a jacket, warm enough to sweat on the climbs. She told me she was doing an out-and-back, nothing technical, nothing off trail. She said she’d be home before dark.



I watched her leave from the kitchen window, hands around my coffee mug, the steam curling up like a warning. She waved without turning, the way young people do when they’re already halfway into their next thought.



That evening, I made chili. I set out a bowl. I checked the driveway once, then twice. At seven, I texted her: “Hey, you close?”



At eight: “Maya?”



At nine: I called. Straight to voicemail.



By ten, my body was doing what it does when it knows something my mind refuses to say. My hands were shaking. The house felt too large, every room holding its breath. I kept walking from window to window like I could see her headlights on the road if I looked hard enough.



I opened the tracking app.



Her activity was logged. A hike. Start time: 9:14 a.m.



Route: a loop that began at a popular trailhead just inside the park boundary. Good cell service in spots. Plenty of foot traffic early in the day, thinning out toward the afternoon.



I zoomed in. A thin line traced the trail like a thread sewn through the trees.



She’d gone a mile. Two. Three. The map showed her moving steady, the pace consistent. The app recorded her heart rate, the way it rises on inclines and dips on flats. It felt obscene to see it, this private rhythm turned into a graph.



At 12:38 p.m., her pace slowed.



At 12:41, it slowed again.



At 12:43, the line stopped.



Not paused. Stopped. A hard end, like someone had cut the thread.



I stared at that little dot on the screen until my eyes watered. It sat just off a curve in the trail, where the contour lines crowded together, indicating a slope. The map didn’t show what it looked like there. The map never shows the way the woods can change in a hundred feet, the way sunlight can vanish and everything can smell suddenly of damp rot.



I refreshed the app, as if the dot might start moving again if I asked politely enough.



It didn’t.



I called the ranger station first, then 911 when I couldn’t make myself believe a voicemail would save her. I told the dispatcher my daughter hadn’t come home. I told her the trail. I told her the last location.



The dispatcher’s voice was calm, practiced. “Ma’am, are you sure she’s missing? Sometimes hikers lose track of time.”



I wanted to scream. Of course she could lose track of time. Of course she could stop somewhere to take pictures. Of course she could decide to get dinner with a friend afterward and forget to text.



But my body knew.



There is a specific kind of dread that comes when you realize you’ve stepped into a story you’ve read before. You know the beats. You know how it ends. You know you’re about to become a statistic.



By midnight, law enforcement and park rangers were on the trail. They asked me what she wore. They asked if she had any medical conditions. They asked if she had any history of depression. They asked if she’d been in a relationship that had ended badly.



They asked everything except the question that lived behind their eyes: Is there anyone who would want to hurt her?



I gave them the tracker data. I showed them the stopped dot. I showed them the time.



The next morning, they went in with dogs.



I stayed home because they told me to. Because they said the trail was crowded with searchers and I would get in the way. Because they said I should be available in case Maya called.



I spent the day sitting on the couch with the phone in my hand, watching the tracker app like it was a heart monitor in an ICU. I kept imagining her alive somewhere, injured but breathing, waiting for someone to find her. I imagined her holding onto her phone, trying to keep the battery alive, watching the same dot I was watching.



At 3:17 p.m., my phone rang.



It was a ranger. He asked if I was sitting down.



His tone flattened my hope into something heavy and cold.



They found her just after noon. Not far from where the tracker dot had stopped. She was off the trail by less than twenty yards, down a small embankment tangled with rhododendron. If you weren’t looking for her, you could walk past and never know.



They said there was no sign of a struggle on the main trail. No disturbed ground. No broken branches. The dogs had picked up her scent, then veered.



They said her hands were clean.



They said her clothes were in place.



They said she had been strangled.



When you hear a sentence like that, the world becomes a hallway. Long and narrow. You can’t turn your head. You can’t look away. You just keep walking down it because there’s nowhere else to go.



I went to the station. I signed papers. I answered questions I barely understood. They asked about the tracker again. They asked about her phone.



I told them the app showed her route. The last dot. The time.



A detective, a man with tired eyes and a neat beard, asked, “Do you know where her phone is?”



“No,” I said. “It was with her. It has to be with her.”



They found the phone later that night, about a quarter mile away from her body, tucked under a fallen log like someone had tried to hide it quickly without caring if it was found. The battery was dead. There were no obvious prints. The case was already slipping into the familiar shape of unsolved.



Except for the tracker.



The detective came to my house two days later. He sat at my kitchen table with a laptop open, the kind of laptop that looked like it had been slammed shut a hundred times.



“We pulled the fitness data from her phone,” he said. “It synced before the phone died.”



I nodded, my hands folded so tightly my knuckles ached. I kept expecting him to say something that would make it less real. People say “I’m sorry” and think it’s a bridge, but it’s just a sign that says the road ahead is still broken.



He turned the laptop toward me.



On the screen was a map of the trail.



Her route traced in bright color. Her pace and heart rate plotted along a timeline. It was the same information I’d seen, but in the hands of the police it looked clinical, like an autopsy report.



He pointed to the stopped dot. “This is where she stopped moving. At 12:43.”



I swallowed. “Yes.”



He clicked again. A new line appeared on the map, separate from the original route. It began at the stopped dot and shot away along a thin, barely marked path that cut through the forest.



At first, my mind didn’t understand what I was seeing. It looked like a mistake, like the app had glitched and drawn a line straight through the trees.



Then I noticed the numbers.



Speed: 12 mph. 18 mph. 26 mph.



Then, at 12:47 p.m., a spike.



Speed: 45 mph.



My breath came out in a sound I didn’t recognize.



“That,” I whispered, “that can’t be her.”



“No,” he said quietly. “It’s not.”



He leaned forward, tapping the screen as if emphasizing reality. “Her phone moved after her heart rate went flat. It moved fast. Faster than anyone runs on that terrain. Faster than any normal hiker carries something.”



He paused, letting the implication settle like ash.



“ATVs,” he said. “Four-wheelers. There are service routes and illegal cut-throughs. People use them. Most of them are local. Most of them know where cameras are and where they aren’t.”



I stared at the line on the screen. The thought of someone taking my daughter’s phone like it was trash, like it was a loose end, made my skin crawl. Not just taking it, but riding away with it, the wind loud in their ears, the woods blurring.



As if her life was nothing more than an inconvenience to remove.



“Was the phone… moving because he had it,” I said, my voice breaking. “Or because she… because…”



The detective’s eyes held mine. He didn’t flinch. “We don’t believe she was alive when the phone moved.”



It was strange, hearing that and feeling relief, a small sick relief that at least she hadn’t been dragged. Then guilt, immediate and sharp, for being relieved about anything at all.



“What about DNA?” I asked. “Fingerprints? Something?”



He shook his head. “Nothing usable. Whoever did it was careful, or lucky, or both.”



He closed the laptop. The click of it shutting sounded like a door locking.



“Witnesses,” he said. “We’ve got two separate people who reported seeing a maroon four-wheeler in that area that afternoon. They didn’t think anything of it at the time. People break the rules all the time. But now that we know the phone moved like this, it matters.”



The next weeks passed in a fog I can’t describe. Grief is not just sadness. It’s a new climate. The air is heavier. Colors look wrong. Time doesn’t behave properly. You can’t trust your own memory because it keeps replaying the same moments, trying to find the exact second everything went bad.



I went through Maya’s room. Her laundry basket still held clothes she’d worn that week. Her charger sat on the nightstand like a small shrine. I found her earbuds in the pocket of her jacket and cried so hard I couldn’t breathe because the thought of her walking that trail listening to music, feeling safe, felt unbearable.



The detective called me to update me, but he never said much. They were working leads. They were interviewing locals. They were trying to match the tracker route to known ATV paths.



One night, he called and his voice sounded different, tight.



“We found him,” he said.



It took me a moment to understand what “him” meant. My mind didn’t want to accept there could be a person attached to what happened, a human being with a name and a face and a house.



“How?” I managed.



“Witnesses,” he said. “Maroon four-wheeler. One of them remembered a detail, a sticker, something on the side panel. Another person saw the same machine at a gas station off the park road. We pulled security footage. Got a partial plate from a truck hauling it.”



He paused. “We served a warrant. We found the ATV. We found her phone.”



My hands went numb around the receiver.



“In his house?” I whispered.



“In his shed,” the detective said. “He’d stripped it for parts. He thought that would erase it.”



Erase it. Like her life was something you could disassemble with a screwdriver.



They arrested him. He confessed. The details were sealed for the trial, and I didn’t ask. Part of me wanted every ugly truth, and part of me wanted to live the rest of my life without seeing her last moments in my mind.



The news called it a victory. The papers wrote about “swift detective work” and “technology aiding investigation.” People I hadn’t spoken to in years sent messages telling me how lucky I was that they caught him.



Lucky.



As if I’d won something.



They put him in court. They put him in a suit. They let him sit in a chair like a person.



I sat behind the prosecutor with Maya’s photo in my hands. In the picture, she’s laughing, hair blown across her face, eyes squinting in sunlight. She looks alive. She looks like she could walk into the room at any moment and tell me I was overreacting.



When they read the tracker data into evidence, my stomach turned.



The prosecutor explained it like a lesson.



“The data shows the victim’s movement,” she said. “At 12:43 p.m., her movement stops. Her heart rate ceases. The phone then travels along a route inconsistent with hiking. At 12:47 p.m., the phone reaches a speed of approximately 45 miles per hour.”



The jurors leaned forward. People love numbers when they’re too afraid to look at what the numbers represent.



The prosecutor said, “This indicates the phone was transported by a motorized vehicle, consistent with an ATV.”



The tracker never lied. It never softened. It never made space for my daughter as a person. It just recorded the truth in neat lines and spikes.



After the trial, after the sentence, after the last news van pulled away, I went back to the app.



It still had the hike saved.



Most people delete those. They don’t want the reminder. They don’t want the route sitting in their pocket like a bruise.



I couldn’t.



I’d open it at night when the house was too quiet and I felt like I was disappearing with her. I’d zoom in on the trail, tracing the line with my finger on the screen as if I could touch her through it.



The stopped dot sat there, still.



The second line, the one that shot away, still looked wrong every time I saw it. Like a violent scribble across something delicate.



Sometimes I’d imagine the moment her phone started moving. I’d picture it in someone else’s hand, bouncing as the ATV hit ruts, the GPS struggling to keep up under a canopy of trees. The phone didn’t know she was gone. The phone kept counting steps, kept looking for motion, kept trying to make sense of a world that had suddenly become senseless.



And then, one night, months later, I noticed something I hadn’t noticed before.



The app lets you replay the hike as an animation. A dot moving along the trail, time rolling forward. It’s meant to show your progress, a little victory lap for your body.



I pressed play.



The dot moved. Maya’s dot. Steady pace, steady heart rate, the line unspooling behind her. I watched it like it was a home video.



At 12:38, the dot slowed.



At 12:41, slower.



At 12:43, it stopped.



I waited for the second line, the fast movement, the part I hated.



But in the seconds between the stop and the speed spike, the dot did something strange.



It moved, just slightly, off the trail, into the brush.



Not fast. Not like the ATV later.



Just a small drift, a wobble, as if she’d stepped one foot off the path.



Then it stopped again.



Then the line shot away, the phone racing through the woods.



I stared so hard my eyes ached.



I replayed it. Again. And again.



The tiny drift was consistent every time. Three, maybe four steps, off the trail. A moment where she was still moving, but not forward.



A moment where she was leaving the path.



I called the detective the next morning. He answered with the weary patience of someone who thought he’d done all he could.



“It’s nothing,” he said at first, when I described it. “GPS drift. Tree cover. The signal bounces.”



But my voice didn’t let go. “It happens every time,” I insisted. “The same direction. The same distance. It’s part of the data.”



Silence on the line.



Then he said, “Send me a screenshot.”



I did.



He called back later that afternoon. His voice was quieter than before.



“We didn’t notice that,” he admitted.



My throat tightened. “What does it mean?”



He exhaled slowly, the sound of someone looking at a door they didn’t want to open. “It could be drift. It could be nothing. But if it isn’t…”



He didn’t finish.



Because if it wasn’t nothing, it meant she’d stepped off the trail willingly or unwillingly. It meant she’d been lured. It meant she’d been approached. It meant the last thing she did was move toward something in the woods.



I sat at my kitchen table after the call ended, staring at the tracker bracelet Maya had left on her dresser when she came home that last night before the hike. She’d forgotten it. She’d taken it off and set it down like it was a watch you didn’t need for sleep.



It was still there, black band curled in a small circle.



The tracker that was supposed to keep her safe had been on her phone instead. A piece of software. A silent witness.



It struck me then, with a clarity that felt like falling, that the tracker had recorded her dying and then recorded her phone being carried away, and the entire time it was doing what it was designed to do.



It wasn’t trying to save her.



It was trying to remember her correctly.



That night, I opened the app again and replayed the hike.



I watched the dot reach the curve in the trail.



I watched it slow.



I watched it drift, those few steps off the path, into the brush where the world holds its breath.



I watched it stop.



And then, like always, the phone began to move at impossible speed, the line shooting away through the trees, through the fog, through the green that never gives anything back.



I sat there until the replay ended and the dot froze, and I realized the worst part was not that the tracker kept watching after she was gone.



The worst part was that it would keep watching forever; long after I was gone too, her last recorded steps would still be there, waiting for someone to press play and watch my daughter disappear all over again.",2,1767951677.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

I’m sharing this here because I’ve used them for ages, and since we Reddit friends are all navigating the post-Christmas financial wreckage, I figure we’re close enough to mates for the sake of a sign-up mates bonus.

**The $30 ""Jan-Tax"" Rebate**

1. Grab the ubank app and use the code **9NXTQV1** when it asks about you during sign-up.
2. Tap your card (or phone) **5 times** within the first 30 days.
3. *The trick:* You don't need a massive deposit. Five small transactions—like buying five separate coffees or scanning five individual groceries—triggers the payout.

**The Catch on their high interest (read this before you commit)** Ubank is great, but they changed the rules recently for their high interest account and it’s a bit of a trap if you’re not paying attention. To get the **4.35% interest rate** (5.10% for the first four months):

* **Crucially,** you have to grow your savings balance by at least **$1** every month (and they don’t count the interest they pay you as ""growth"").
* If you treat your savings like a revolving door and it doesn’t go up by that gold coin, the interest rate drops off a cliff. It’s a hoop, so only go for it if you're the type to actually track that stuff.

**Why bother?** Aside from the free thirty, it’s a brand of NAB and has the **Government $250k guarantee**, so it’s a proper bank. There are no account fees, and it’s one of the few cards that doesn't charge you a ""convenience fee"" for using an ATM or buying stuff while you're overseas.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents.

The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

As characters grappled with the clichés that defined their lives, they discovered that beneath the familiarity lay profound truths and unexpected consequences.

Through the lens of cliché, I explored the characters' journey to navigate the clichéd landscapes of their existence.

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged—a rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The mantra echoed in the desolate wasteland of Endless Sands, a barren landscape where hope was as scarce as water. Through the repetition of epizeuxis, the protagonist's internal resolve became a resounding anthem, a defiant roar against the relentless challenges of survival.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged—a message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos. As the characters deciphered the acrostic, they unraveled the mysteries of their existence, connecting the dots between the stars and their own profound journeys.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1767951037.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

For context im a 20 year old girl. Ive been working I think since i was around 14. When i was 16 i started working 30-50 hours weekly. I was always praised for my hard work and how much money i had in the bank it felt great so i just kept going. My parents kind of stopped supporting me since i had my own income so I kinda started doing everything on my own since 16-17. When I turned 19 I bought my own car and moved out to a studio apartment. I also have 2 cats and a rabbit and a phone bill to pay so you can imagine how much im spending monthly. Im currently a (online) college student, and working 2-3 jobs averaging around 60-70 hours a week. Im so tired. I wake up at 5am go to work till 3pm where I then go to my other job at 330pm just to get off at 10pm. I go home do my homework (assuming i don’t have one of my overnight shifts) and crash. I dont have time to do anything i like, crocheting, drawing, even relaxing. Ive worn myself so thin that I cant even eat or sleep well anymore. I would love just a tiny break but im terrified even one missed day of working id lose everything. I dont have a room at home anymore so moving back in isnt an option. I dont even want to work in the future it seems miserable. I major in Human Resources and i genuinely can not live a life continuously doing this miserable cycle. I thought maybe to finally want to live this life to make it worth living id run my own company. A coffee shop where i sell the things i love like herbalism and crochet! Its great in idea and ive been trying my hardest to start selling things but i dont have time off work to start. Even with all this working i have no room to do anything i like, buying groceries terrifies me and god forbid i went out for a night. Theres nothing GOOD waiting for me and i cant see myswlf ever being happy living a future like this. Every out that i can take to feel better is closed. I even considered admitting myself for some help and bettwr thinking for a little when things were really bad but guess what i cant even go there either because missing a week of work would end me. Starting a company? No time. A vacation? No time. Moving back home? Not an option. I just want to run away, to escape, to do whatever i can to leave this purgatory. Im so scared, im so tired, and i dont know how much longer i can stand this. Everyone says oh just wait till u graduate and get a better paying job, and thats not even a solution either. As ive been writing this its gone a lot more from a nicely written vent to a spew of words but i just am so frustrated and sleep deprived. I just want to live, live happily, doing things i love but i genuinely dont think its an option. If thats not an option then what am i fighting for??? Im only 20 i just want to go out with my friends and go to stupid lame frat parties. Why did i have to mature and become independent at such a young age. I feel like i lost my whole childhood and it seems im going to lose a future too. UGHHHH anyways this is cringey i need to stop writing im just so tired and no one seems to understand the depth of this situation im in.  ",1,1767950907.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

I’ve had my Sage Barista Pro for about a month and recently started getting a ratcheting/clicking noise while grinding - sounds like the clutch slipping.

This started right after I switched from my usual medium/dark roast to a lighter roast. The lighter beans worked fine for the first \~200g, but then the noise began and hasn’t gone away. Even when I switch back to medium/dark roasts, I still occasionally get the same noise.

**What I’ve tried so far:**

* Full grinder clean
* Cleaned upper + lower burrs
* Checked for obstructions
* Tried various grind sizes
* Reset settings

No improvement.

It feels like the lighter beans may have stressed the grinder, which is strange because I’d expect it to handle them. I make 2–3 coffees a day, and the machine is only a month old. Bought from John Lewis, so I can return/exchange if needed.

**Questions for anyone who’s owned this machine:**

* Have you had this clutch‑slipping / ratcheting noise happen before?
* Is this a known weakness when grinding light roasts with the Barista Pro?
* Do most people avoid light roasts entirely with Sage built‑in grinders?
* Does this sound like a defective grinder or just a common limitation?

I love the machine overall - I had a bean perfectly dialed in and pulling great shots before this. But after one bag of lighter roast, it suddenly started acting up and hasn’t recovered.

Any advice or similar experiences would be really appreciated!",1,1767950546.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

hey everyone i know the struggle is real saving for a house deposit when rent is eating up half your paycheck but figured i'd share a few things i've been trying that are actually helping me build my savings faster  
  
first up you have to know your goal. research the average home price in your area and then aim for the ideal 20 percent down to skip pmi, but honestly a lot of loans like fha let you do way less like 3 to 5 percent. get that number then work backwards to set a monthly savings goal and a realistic timeline.  
  
next is the money management stuff. open a high-yield savings account just for the down payment and turn on automatic deposits from your checking account every payday. treat that transfer like a non-negotiable bill. then you gotta deep dive into your budget. cut all the unnecessary spending like streaming services you barely watch, pricey coffee, and eating out. i was shocked how much i saved by cooking at home way more. also check your big bills like car insurance and your cell plan to see if you can switch or negotiate a better rate.  
  
to boost income, you have a few options. the classic side hustle is a huge help. if you have a garage or an extra parking spot at your rental, you could make some super easy passive income by listing that unused space on prked. hosts on there make money by renting their driveways or garages to drivers and you set your own price and schedule, so it's a quick and simple way to put extra cash straight into your house fund. otherwise you can look at freelancing online, picking up extra shifts, or selling old stuff you dont use anymore.  
  
and dont forget about free money or cheap loans. look into first-time homebuyer down payment assistance programs through your state or local housing authority. these are usually for first-time buyers or people below a certain income level. the assistance can be a grant that you never have to pay back, or a forgivable loan that you dont have to repay as long as you stay in the house for a set number of years. a simple google search for ""down payment assistance your city"" should get you started.  
  
hope this helps anyone feeling discouraged by their landlord. we got this.",1,1767950523.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Road conditions on most stretches are **really good**, especially Mulshi and Tamhini side. Scenic views, smooth sections, and decent curves — perfect for a relaxed weekend ride. Early morning is best to avoid traffic.

Good spots for short breaks near Mulshi lake and around Tamhini. Fuel up before heading into the ghat sections.

1q83oub,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q83oub/the_door_in_the_roots/,The Door in the Roots,"My first mistake was tripping on a root of a tree, on a trail I have walked 500 times. Something shiny caught the day's last few rays of light. I brushed the dirt and years of decomposing leaves off and saw a brass handle sticking up from a heavy door.

I used my foot to clear the complete outline of the door. On all sides it sat perfectly flush with the hard packed dirt around it. Other than the handle, only three hinges of similar looking material rose above the ground, not even a millimeter. It almost looked like the door was being swallowed by the earth. Or regurgitated.

I told myself not to open it. There were a dozen reasons why coming back tomorrow, with friends and hours of daylight to burn was the smart move.

So, I pulled the handle and the hinges glided like they were just oiled, not a sound other than my own efforts. Under it was not dirt or stone, but a set of steps dug right into the earth. They looked dry and sturdy. It smelled less damp and stale down there than the forest I stood in. Instead, the hallway felt slightly …electric. It was narrow and there was a dim light that flickered differently than torches would. I imagine, I had never been anywhere lit by torch light alone.

I paused at the threshold. This feeling. It reminded me when someone dares you to do something stupid, that moment just before your tongue touches the battery. The metallic taste is somehow already in your mouth. But turning back seemed crazier than going forward, so I swung the door entirely open and stepped down.

At the bottom of the eight or so steps, the hallway narrowed and curved and a light source was coming from further on. It would only take a few steps down the hallway before my entrance, and the only known exit would be out of sight. I stepped closer to the first bend, wanting to see the source of the light, but it seemed to be matching my pace, staying around each next bend.. I shimmied slowly, and stopped multiple times to quickly bound back towards the steps.

It bent and bent, now almost curling on it itself. I turned, suddenly realizing I went too far. I sprinted back to the stairs to find the earth finished regurgitating the door. Nothing but solid dirt remained. I was not surprised, but I was beginning to sweat against the cool air.

Then light down the hall got twice as bright. The dirt walls gradually changed to wallpaper. Floral. Faded. Peeling. Patchy the first few feet, and slowly the dirt became rare, until the glowing floral pattern completely took over. Like ivy completely covering a brick wall.

After a short straight away, the hallway continued to bend right and left angles. Corners that pinched like toy box hinges. And every few feet, doors. Too many. Some were half-sized, for small children or large raccoons. Others were oblong or obtuse, short barn style doors, complete with barn smells wafting underneath.

That was my reality, opening random doors in Wonderland. I looked for one that gave the least amount of creepy vibes. Many were too small, one doorknob glowed red hot, and as I got near, I could feel heat. Another was completely covered by a mirror. It took me a beat to realize my reflection had no head.

Eventually, I came to the most offensive door. Inside was a room full of coat racks. Every coat was dripping wet, but the floor was bone dry. I took a full step in, but kept my hand in the door jam. With my other hand I turned one around, it was a person, hollowed flat, hung up like laundry. Their faces sagged but their eyes, with more depth than their skulls, moved. Blinked. Silently begged for help.

I said “sorry” like that, fixed anything, and shut the door.

I was relieved to be back in the safety of the neverending hallway I’d probably die in. Humans are quick to move the goalposts.

I picked another door, because bad things happen in threes. This one opened to what looked like the diner downtown. Same booths, same greasy laminated menus. But the “people” eating there were all… wrong. Like someone had described humans to an alien, and that alien did their best. Slightly Picassoesque faces stated et me with unsymmetrical eyes, looked at me over menus they gripped too hard with far too many fingers. Still chewing, slurping, sipping coffee that was the wrong color. It had no color.

The waitress turned and smiled at me with teeth that went back too far. She said, “Table for one?”

And I swear, I nodded just to avoid being rude .

That’s when I realized the door behind me was gone.

All the doors were gone. Just endless booths, endless chewing. Why did they have so many fucking fingers.

The forest had spit me out somewhere else. Or maybe it swallowed me whole.

Either way, I’m not lost. I’m seated.

And the waitress is bringing me pie.

She slid the plate across the table. Pie. Cherry. But too red, and it smelled like pennies and… bleach?

“On the house,” she said.

Her voice was kind. Too kind. Funeral-home kind.

I picked up the fork because not doing so felt like insulting her, and it was obvious you don’t want to piss off the help in a place like this.

The first bite burned. Not hot—cold. My tongue bordered on frostbite. My teeth ached, my jaw hummed. The “cherry” wasn't a cherry at all. It was meat. Like those cubes chunks in a can of Campbell's. I wish this was a can of Campbell's soup

I smiled. “Delicious.”

She nodded, far too satisfied, and walked away.

That’s when I noticed the pie looked untouched . Every forkful I took, it refilled. Whole again.

The booths around me started watching. Not with their eyes—most didn’t have eyes that worked right—but with the subtle lean, the twitch of a jaw, the faint scrape of chairs turning. Like a hundred mannequins holding their breath, waiting to see what I’d do next.

I tried standing. My legs didn’t move. Not frozen, not restrained. Just politely refusing. Like they’d decided to sit, and my brain was in no position to argue.

The ceiling lights flickered. One of them buzzed, then dripped. Not water—something thicker. The drop hit the table and crawled toward the pie like a slug late for work.

I whispered, “I want to go home.”

And the whole diner answered, in perfect harmony, “Then finish your slice.”

The fork was back in my hand. My fingers clenched it without asking me first. The pie pulsed. The red filling bubbled once. Like a wink. Even the pie was in on it.

So I did the only logical thing. I stabbed the fork down, straight through the crust. The whole diner flinched at once—every patron jerking in unison, like I’d just hit the fire alarm inside their veins.

The lights cut out.

Silence.

When they flicked back on, I wasn’t at the table anymore. I was standing in the hallway again. The floral wallpaper looked to have taken on a slightly red hue.

The plate was still in my hand.

Empty. Clean. Like I’d licked it spotless.

I dropped it. I did not hear it hit the ground.

My brain said run. But, don’t run on an Escher staircase. No one has the cardio for that.

And plus, they want you to run. I still did not know who “they” were, or why they wanted you to run, but I assumed it made us taste better,

So I walked, the hairs on the back of my neck reaching straight out behind me. Doors lining both sides, all of them humming with something alive behind them. One door shook like it was laughing. A few doors down, one oozed a blue fluid that I carefully stepped over. One smelled like Axe body spray, and that one made me the most nervous.

Finally, I saw it: a door with a glowing EXIT sign above it. Classic trap.

I pushed it open.

Inside was… my living room. Couch. Coffee table. The ugly lamp I keep meaning to throw out. The TV was on, showing a rerun of a show I've been watching.

It was too perfect. .

I stepped in anyway, mostly because I had not seen this episode yet.

The door slammed behind me, and the laughter track from the TV got louder. Then it wasn’t a laugh track—it was the forest. Thousands of voices, leaves and branches cackling in sync. .

The TV characters turned to me, dead eyes bright, and said, “Welcome home.”

Why does everyone here have perfect pitch?

I bolted. Straight back through the door. Straight back into the hallway. The wallpaper was peeling faster now, flaking off like skin after a sunburn. The whole place groaned like it was tired of hosting me.

And then—mercifully, stupidly—there it was. Another door. Small, crooked, glowing faintly like a night-light.

I opened it, and the forest spat me out. Fresh air. Trees. Moonlight.

I fell to my knees in the dirt, gasping. The forest was quiet. No whispers. No laughter. Just crickets and owls making their normal chatter.

I looked back. The door with the brass handle was gone. Just roots now. Tangled and ordinary. .

I would have written it all off as a dream, or I hit my head and was just coming to. But the taste in my mouth was still sweet. Still cold. Still cherry pie.

I staggered up, wanting to run to safety, but I knew whatever happened was done. It was over.

And when I touched my stomach, it pulsed.

Like something inside me was waiting for the next course. ",4,1767950260.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some stuff i learned recently about getting a solid emergency fund set up for the family. it feels like a huge mountain to climb but honestly, once you start, it gets way easier.  
  
first big step is figuring out your target. most experts say aim for three to six months of essential living expenses. that's rent, mortgage, groceries, utilities, transportation, and insurance. if your job is a little unpredictable or you have high health deductibles, you might want to shoot for the six month side. don't try to save it all at once though. start with a small, manageable goal, like saving $1,000 first, or even just one paycheck's worth of expenses. hitting those smaller wins gives you motivation to keep going.  
  
the most important trick is to make it automatic. seriously, pay yourself first. set up an automatic transfer from your checking to a separate high-yield savings account right after payday. make it a bill you have to pay. also, if your employer lets you, you can split your direct deposit so a portion goes straight to savings before it even hits your main checking account. out of sight, out of mind is key here. a high-yield savings account is best because it keeps the money safe, accessible, and earns a little bit of interest.  
  
to speed things up, look for easy extra income. if you have extra space like a driveway, unused garage, or even just an extra room you use for storage, you can list it on prked. it's a super easy way to make passive income from space you aren't using anyway. you set the price and schedule, and the extra money can go straight into your emergency fund. it's a great way to hit your goal faster than just cutting back on coffee.  
  
another fast way to boost the fund is by saving all your financial windfalls. tax refunds, work bonuses, or even cash gifts from family should all go directly into the fund. you were fine without that money, so don't spend it. also, try a ""no-spend weekend"" challenge once a month and put all the money you would have spent on dining out or shopping into the fund instead. small cuts like downgrading a streaming service or an old cell plan add up fast over a few months.  
  
it's super important to only use the money for true emergencies, like a job loss, a major medical bill, or an urgent car repair. once you use it, make a plan to replenish it immediately so your family is protected again.  
  
hope this helps someone get started on their savings journey!",1,1767950190.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Just looking for reassurance or advice..

I did my first dose of Reta today (1mg) at about 12pm. Yes I calculated it correctly, I used a peptide calculator and double triple checked.

Anyway, about 3 hrs after the shot I got a massive wave of nausea after using the toilet (#2). I broke out into a severe sweat but it subsided within 3 mins. Since then, I had multiple waves of nausea, until my body said fuck this and I projectile vomited into the toilet.

Needless to say, I feel much better after it. But I’m worried it’ll happen again.. I also have lower back pain that seems to only have started after it.

For reference, I had 1x panadeine forte about 4am this morning, and took my BPC157/probiotic capsule about 10am with my usual sertraline.

I had an iced coffee and a ham and cheese pocket for breakfast about 10:30am also.

hey everyone, figured i'd share some stuff i learned jumping into the short term rental game a few years ago. it's totally different from long term renting, especially in a high traffic area, but the profits are way better if you do it right.  
  
first thing, you have to get smart about the work. since you're probably working another job or traveling, you can't be there all the time. this is where tech saves you. smart locks with changing codes for every guest are a must-have, that way check-in is totally seamless and key-free. also set up automated messages so people get check-in info, wifi passwords, and a welcome message right when they need it. it feels personalized but you barely lift a finger. a smart thermostat is another easy win for energy savings.  
  
second is the money moves. in a tourist area, pricing needs to be dynamic. don't set a flat rate all year. use a pricing tool to automatically jack up the price for local festivals, major holidays, and peak season weekends, and then drop it on slow tuesdays in november. also, make sure your listing is on all the main platforms—airbnb, vrbo, bookingcom—to maximize your occupancy rate. and please, hire a pro photographer. your phone pics aren't going to cut it against the competition.  
  
third, standing out is huge. everyone has an apartment downtown. think about what makes yours \*different\*. a unique rental type like a cool tiny house, an a-frame cabin, or a really strongly themed space can charge more and get booked up faster. simple things work too, like ultra-fast wifi, a killer coffee setup, or a detailed digital guidebook with the best hidden local spots.  
  
if your property has any extra parking—a driveway, a garage, or even a spot on the side—list that extra space on prked. seriously. when tourists come, parking is a huge pain and they hate the chaos of finding a spot. you can make extra passive income just by renting out that unused space to people who need convenient, close parking. or, if you give the spot to your guests, you can even charge a little premium on your nightly rate and they feel like they're getting vip parking that is usually closer and safer on someone's property. it's an easy win to make a little extra cash and make your guests love you.  
  
lastly, you have to build a local team. you need a rockstar cleaner and a reliable handyman on call. even with all the tech, things will break or a pipe will leak. you can't be flying back every time. make your cleaner your eyes and ears on the ground. and for the love of all that is holy, check your city's short term rental laws. you don't want a huge fine because you missed a basic license or zoning rule.  
  
hope this helps you all get started and make that passive income dream a reality.",1,1767949412.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q83gjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1q83gjm/the_psychology_of_power_how_to_stop_being_the/,The Psychology of POWER: How to Stop Being the Weaker One in Any Room (Science-Backed),"Ever walked into a room and felt instantly smaller? Like everyone else got the memo on how to command respect, but you're still waiting for yours to load? I've been there. Spent years watching people half as qualified dominate conversations while I nodded along like a dashboard bobblehead. Then I got obsessed with understanding why, diving into research on social psychology, body language, and behavioral economics. Turns out, power isn't something you're born with. It's a skill you can learn.



The real mindfuck? Most of what we think creates power, status symbols, loud voices, aggressive posturing, actually doesn't. True power is subtler and way more effective.



1. Stop Apologizing for Existing



Real talk: people who constantly say ""sorry"" for every minor thing train others to see them as lower status. Research from Harvard's negotiation program shows excessive apologizing signals insecurity and tanks your perceived competence by up to 30%.



Notice when you apologize unnecessarily. ""Sorry, can I ask a question?"" becomes ""I have a question."" ""Sorry I'm late"" (when you're 2 minutes late) becomes ""Thanks for waiting."" You're not being rude. You're reclaiming linguistic space.



The book ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" by Robert Glover (therapist who spent decades studying approval seeking behavior) breaks this down brilliantly. It's not about becoming an asshole. It's about stopping the compulsive need to make yourself smaller so others feel bigger. Best book I've read on breaking people pleasing patterns that kill your social power.



 2. Master the Pause



Powerful people don't rush to fill silence. They let it work for them. This one trick changed everything for me in meetings and conversations.



When someone asks you a question, pause for 2-3 seconds before responding. Sounds simple but it's insanely hard at first. That pause communicates ""I'm thinking about this because my response matters"" rather than ""I'm desperate to please you with the right answer.""



Chris Voss covers this in ""Never Split the Difference"" (former FBI hostage negotiator, taught at Harvard, Georgetown, this guy literally used silence to save lives). He calls it tactical empathy. The pause gives you control of the conversation's tempo and makes your words carry more weight when they finally come.



3. Take Up Space Unapologetically



Small movements, small presence, small power. Your body language is constantly broadcasting your status whether you realize it or not.



Researchers at Columbia and Harvard found that holding expansive postures for just 2 minutes increases testosterone (dominance hormone) and decreases cortisol (stress hormone). But here's what they don't tell you: it's not just about the pose, it's about occupying space without apologizing for it.



Stop pulling your arms in. Stop making yourself compact. Spread out a bit when you sit. Walk with your shoulders back. Use hand gestures that extend beyond your body. You're not trying to dominate others, you're just refusing to shrink anymore.



 4. Learn to Say No Without Explanation



Every time you over explain a boundary, you weaken it. ""No"" is a complete sentence, but most of us turn it into a paragraph of justifications.



Someone asks you to take on extra work? ""I can't take that on right now"" works better than ""Oh I'm so sorry but I'm really swamped and I have this thing and my cat is sick and..."" The moment you over explain, you're asking for permission to enforce your own boundary.



Start small. Practice saying no to minor requests without explaining. Notice how uncomfortable it feels. That discomfort is your people pleasing programming fighting back. Push through it.



 5. Control Your Reaction to Status Plays



Here's something nobody talks about: other people will test your power constantly through subtle put downs, interruptions, and dismissals. How you react determines whether you rise or fall in the hierarchy.



When someone interrupts you, don't speed up or get quieter. Pause, maintain eye contact, and calmly continue your point. When someone makes a subtle dig, don't laugh it off or get defensive. Acknowledge it directly: ""Interesting take"" then move on.



Robert Greene's ""The 48 Laws of Power"" gets shit for being manipulative but it's really just describing social dynamics that already exist. Law 36: Disdain Things You Cannot Have. Don't react emotionally to status challenges. That reaction is what they're actually testing for. Stay composed and you win by default.



 6. Stop Seeking Validation



The fastest way to lose power? Making other people the scoreboard for your self worth. When you constantly check if others approve, you hand them control over your emotional state.



Catch yourself seeking micro validations. The glance after you make a joke to see if people laughed. The careful monitoring of text response times. The fishing for compliments. Each one is a small power handoff.



Validation should come from internal metrics: Did I show up how I wanted to? Did I honor my values? Did I try my best? External validation is dessert, not the meal.



BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts that creates personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans tailored to your specific goals. You tell it what you want to work on, like building confidence or understanding social dynamics, and it pulls insights from books, research papers, and expert talks to generate custom podcasts. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. Plus there's a virtual coach called Freedia you can chat with about your struggles, and it'll recommend content that actually fits your situation. Makes internalizing these concepts way more practical than just reading about them once.



Finch is solid for building this internal validation muscle through habit tracking and self compassion exercises. It gamifies personal growth in a way that actually builds intrinsic motivation rather than external approval seeking.



 7. Speak Last, But Speak With Conviction



There's a reason leaders often speak last in meetings. They gather information, read the room, then deliver a decisive take. You don't need to be first, you need to be memorable.



When you do speak, eliminate qualifiers. ""I think maybe we could possibly..."" becomes ""We should do X because Y."" Not every statement needs hedging language. You're not being arrogant, you're being clear.



Practice this anywhere. Coffee shop, friend group, work meeting. Wait, listen, then deliver your point with conviction. Watch how differently people respond.



 8. Build Real Competence



Here's the unsexy truth: all the power moves in the world mean nothing if you're incompetent. Real sustained power comes from being genuinely good at something valuable.



Pick one skill that matters in your domain and become undeniably excellent at it. Not jack of all trades, master of none. One thing where people think ""they're the person for that.""



Tim Ferriss breaks down skill acquisition beautifully in ""The 4 Hour Chef."" It's technically a cookbook but it's really about meta learning and deconstructing expertise. The framework helped me go from average to legitimately skilled at my craft in under a year.



 9. Remember Everyone's Faking It Too



The people who seem most powerful in the room? They're also managing insecurity, self doubt, and imposter syndrome. They've just gotten better at not broadcasting it.



Social power is partially a collective hallucination. We agree someone has power, so they do. That's weirdly liberating once you realize it. You're not waiting for permission to be powerful. You're just deciding to show up differently.



You're not trying to dominate anyone. You're trying to stop surrendering power that was yours all along. There's a massive difference. One creates zero sum competition, the other creates mutual respect.

i figured i'd share some ways i see people making money when the summer tourists hit the beach towns. it's all about catching the patterns and offering convenience.  
  
first thing you gotta realize is the parking chaos is the worst part of a beach day for visitors, especially between 10 am and 2 pm when the sun is highest. if you live near the beach and have a driveway or unused garage, you can easily make some passive income by listing that space on prked. it's super simple to list your extra space, you set your own price and schedule, and it helps people skip the street parking madness for vip parking that's way cheaper and sometimes even closer. the hosts can even watch the car for them which feels safer for the parker.  
  
now for the business ideas, you can think of it in two main shifts: the morning rush and the afternoon wind-down.  
  
the morning/peak sun (before 10 am to 2 pm) crowd needs stuff for the day.  
\- beach gear rentals: this is big. tourists don't want to lug an umbrella, two chairs, a cooler, and a boogie board. a quick pop-up for chair and umbrella rentals right near a major access point is a goldmine.  
\- coffee and hydration: a small mobile stand with cold brew, ice water, and maybe a few pre-packaged healthy snacks is perfect for the early risers.  
\- surf/paddleboard lessons: the water is usually calmer in the morning, which is perfect for beginner lessons. offer a 9 am class.  
  
the afternoon/evening (after 2 pm) crowd is ready to chill.  
\- quick convenience food: people don't want a heavy meal. think food truck or pop-up selling things like gourmet hot dogs, ice cream, or pre-made sandwiches they can eat on the beach while waiting for sunset.  
\- family photography: the golden hour right before sunset is the best light for photos. offer quick 15-minute family portrait sessions right on the sand to capture their vacation memories.  
\- bike/scooter rentals: once the day cools down, people want to explore the boardwalk or town without walking. rent out a small fleet for 2-3 hour blocks.  
  
critical thing to remember: you absolutely must check local laws. for any kind of business, even a pop-up, you'll need a temporary business license and a seller's permit to deal with sales tax. if you're on the actual sand, you'll probably need a specific beach vendor permit from the city or county which dictates where you can operate and what you can sell. if you're selling food, a health permit is non-negotiable.

Dehyeon Park had always been sunlight in human form.

He laughed easily, smiled with his whole face, and talked to strangers like they were old friends. On campus, people said that if you stood near Dehyeon long enough, your mood would improve automatically.

Choi Hyungjin didn’t believe that.
At least—not at first.

Hyungjin preferred quiet corners, headphones on, coffee slightly bitter.

 He noticed things without meaning to: the way Dehyeon’s sleeves always slipped down his wrists, how his eyes curved when he smiled, how he waved a little too enthusiastically.


They became partners for a group project by chance.
Or maybe fate was bored.

“Hyungjin-ssi!” Dehyeon said brightly on their first meeting, leaning forward with sparkling eyes. “Let’s do our best together, okay?”

Hyungjin nodded. “Yeah. Sure.”
But his gaze lingered a second too long.

Playful Glances & Growing Warmth


Studying together became routine. Dehyeon talked while Hyungjin typed. Sometimes Dehyeon would lean too close, pointing at the screen, their shoulders brushing.

“Why are you staring?” Dehyeon teased one afternoon, catching Hyungjin mid-glance.
“I’m not,” Hyungjin replied quickly.

Dehyeon grinned. “You are. Your eyes do this thing.”

“What thing?”
“This thing,” Dehyeon said, locking eyes with him on purpose.

Hyungjin looked away first.
Dehyeon laughed—but his ears turned red.


Jealousy in the Sun~


The feeling hit Hyungjin unexpectedly.
They were in the cafeteria when a junior sat next to Dehyeon, laughing loudly, touching his arm a little too freely.

“You’re really easy to talk to,” the junior said.
Dehyeon smiled, polite and warm. “Oh, thank you.”

Hyungjin’s jaw tightened.
He didn’t speak much the rest of the day.

Later, as they walked home, Dehyeon glanced at him. “Did I do something wrong?”

“No.” Hyungjin replied.

“Hyungjin,” Dehyeon said softly, stopping in front of him. “You’re lying.”

Hyungjin hesitated. Then, quietly, “I didn’t like how close he was to you.”

Dehyeon blinked.
Then smiled—slow, gentle, understanding.
“…So you noticed.”


The Kiss

It happened at sunset.
They were on the rooftop, the city glowing orange. The wind tugged at Dehyeon’s hair as he stepped closer, eyes playful but sincere.

“You know,” Dehyeon said, “you’re not as cold as you pretend.”

Hyungjin swallowed. “And you’re not as clueless as you act.”

Dehyeon laughed softly. Their eyes met—held—neither looking away this time.

“Can I?” Dehyeon asked, voice barely above a whisper.
Hyungjin nodded.

The kiss was gentle. Warm. Brief—but full of promise.
When they pulled apart, Dehyeon rested his forehead against Hyungjin’s.

“Stay,” he said.
Hyungjin smiled—small, real, and just for him.
“I was planning to.”

hey, figured i'd share a few good ways to turn a residential property near a stadium, park, theme park, or whatever into a side hustle. the location is the main thing here, so you've already won half the battle.  
  
first and honestly the easiest way to make money from space you aren't even using is with parking. if you have an extra driveway spot, a garage, or even a side lawn you can temporarily use, list it. i use an app like prked because it's super easy to list your extra space like a driveway or garage and start earning passive income. it literally takes minutes to set up, you get to set your own price and availability, and they handle all the payments. people will pay way cheaper than the event lot price for a secure spot that lets them skip the parking chaos when leaving the venue. you can even rent out your garage or extra yard space for long-term storage of things like rvs, boats, or construction equipment.  
  
the biggest way is short-term rentals, obviously. if local rules allow it, turn the whole place into a vacation rental or homestay. airbnb and vrbo are the go-to platforms. with a location near an attraction, you have to use dynamic pricing. that means hiking the price significantly for major holidays, big concerts, or sporting events. even if you don't rent the whole place, you can rent out a separate guest room.  
  
to make your listing stand out and charge more, focus on amenities that travelers actually want. think high-speed wi-fi for business travelers, a hot tub or a game room, or even just leaving out things like beach chairs or a grill if you are near a beach or resort area. little things like offering to pick up groceries or having a coffee bar can make a huge difference. you can also partner with local businesses to offer your guests discounts on tours or spa treatments.  
  
always check your local ordinances first, especially for short-term rentals, as some cities have strict rules or even bans. but between parking, storage, and short-term rent, there are a bunch of ways to monetize that sweet location.  
  
hope this helps someone start earning some extra cash.",1,1767949050.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

figured i'd share a bunch of local side hustle ideas for anyone trying to make some extra money this summer with all the tourists and people out of school. a lot of these focus on convenience for people on vacation which is what they pay for.  
  
first, if you have any extra space like a driveway or a garage or even a side yard, you should look into prked. you can list your space there for people to rent. it's super easy to list in minutes and then it's basically passive income. you set your own rates and availability right in the app. people rent spots hourly, daily, or even monthly for things like cars, rvs, or boats, so it works really well in the summer.  
  
service-based ideas that peak in summer:  
\- lawn care and pressure washing. lawns grow like crazy and people hate yard work when it's hot. pressure washing driveways or houses is fast money.  
\- mobile car wash and detailing. people drive a lot on road trips so mobile detailing where you go to them is super popular and easy to start.  
\- house sitting and pet sitting. all the families going on vacation need reliable people for their pets and to check on their house. look on sites like rover.  
  
rental and experience ideas:  
\- local tour guide. if you know the city or a cool nature trail well, offer a walking tour, food crawl, or a bike ride experience. you can list these on sites like airbnb experiences.  
\- beach gear rentals. if you live near the coast, rent out chairs, umbrellas, coolers, or boogie boards. people don't want to travel with all that gear.  
\- roadside stand. if you're good at baking or have a garden, set up a stand for lemonade, cold brew coffee, fresh produce, or cottage foods. you catch the drive-by traffic.  
\- pool rentals. believe it or not, there are apps where you can rent out your pool by the hour. if you have a private pool and don't mind the cleanup, it's a thing.  
  
don't forget event staffing. with all the summer festivals and events, companies are always hiring temporary help for setup, ticket taking, or concession stands. they need a ton of people from june to august.

Having now compiled and revised them, I am republishing them here. The articles are rather lengthy, as my aim is to facilitate discussion of differing viewpoints and to examine policies adopted by various nations towards their own ethnic minorities. This serves as a reference point for anticipating potential future foreign policy directions.

**Xinjiang's Foundational Snow and Ice Resources**

Snow and ice resources encompass: natural resources (snow quality, glaciers, hydrology, etc.) and cultural resources (tourism, snow and ice culture, winter sports).

Situated between 45° and 47° north latitude within the world's prime skiing belt, Xinjiang possesses exceptional snow and ice resources. These include a snow season lasting 150–240 days, featuring high-quality snow conditions and distinctive terrain. Particularly notable is the Altay region, acclaimed as ‘China's Snow Capital’. It hosts four major ski resorts: General Mountain, Keketuohai, Jikepulin, and Qinggeli Wolf Mountain. with annual snow cover exceeding six months and average natural snow depth surpassing one metre, reaching up to two metres in mountainous areas. These conditions create exceptional opportunities for the development of the snow and ice economy.

**Economic Revenue from Snow and Ice Resources (Nationwide/Xinjiang)**

According to data from the 2023-2024 snow season, Xinjiang's snow tourism revenue reached ¥106.697 billion (compared to ¥524.7 billion nationwide for snow leisure tourism), representing a year-on-year increase of 263.74%. Visitor numbers exceeded 92.58 million (nationwide: 190 million), marking a 147.78% year-on-year rise. With robust support from Beijing, Xinjiang's snow and ice economy has demonstrated rapid growth.

From a broader perspective, the snow and ice economy represents not isolated development but a catalyst driving comprehensive production and cultural markets. It has bridged tourism barriers between northern and southern regions, transforming the harsh frontier into a tourist hotspot. Naturally, such achievements hinge on the prerequisite of transport infrastructure development.

**The entire economic ecosystem will drive development across three tiers of the industrial chain:**

Upstream Industrial Chain:

Common infrastructure in large-scale ski resorts—including magic carpets, cable cars, and ski lifts—alongside snowmaking machines, snow groomers, and ice-making equipment. These constitute the bulk of both initial investment (42%) and ongoing maintenance costs (44%).

Stimulated by the vast blue ocean market of winter sports, China's industrial behemoth has experienced explosive growth. Domestic production of tow-bar aerial ropeways has surged from 7.69% to 38.24%, while snow groomers and snowmaking vehicles have risen from 14.08% and 7.14% to 20.45% and 25.32% respectively.

The expansion of the skiing industry has further stimulated growth in apparel and specialised equipment. By the end of November, sales of Xinjiang down jackets on e-commerce platforms surged by 42%, while waterproof jackets saw a 28% increase.

**Midstream Industry Chain:**

Currently, Xinjiang boasts 188 snow and ice venues across all categories, achieving full coverage across 14 prefecture-level cities and autonomous prefectures. This includes 101 ski resorts, with 44 classified as S-grade, 6 as 5S-grade, and 11 as 4S-grade. Across the region, S-grade ski resorts welcomed 2.9528 million visitors, generating tourism revenue of 655 million yuan, representing year-on-year increases of 31.16% and 138.22% respectively.

The nationally designated Altay Prefecture has established four ski resorts: General Mountain International Ski Resort, Keketuohai International Ski Resort, Hemu Jikepurin International Ski Resort, and Qinggeli Langshan International Ski Resort. These facilities directly foster national and international sporting events and athlete development, exemplified by the ski academy established in partnership with France's Club Med and the 2025 World Freeride Tour (FWT) scheduled for Xinjiang's Altay region.

Simultaneously, winter sports have assumed a role in preserving and promoting ethnic minority cultures. For instance, Hemu Village stands as one of China's most intact and historically significant Tuvan settlements. Niche Kazakh traditions like fur-skinsledding, falconry, winter transhumance, and sheep-grabbing are now gaining wider recognition across China. This brings to mind the curious approach of the United States towards preserving Native American cultures. Typically, tribal names are retained only after the peoples have been exterminated or severely decimated. There's a sense of white colonialists acting with a divine mandate – killing you and then appropriating your name as if it were of no consequence. Military equipment names like Apache, Comanche, Chinook, Kiowa, Black Hawk, and Tomahawk all bear deep connections to North American Indian tribal cultures.

**Downstream Industry Chain:**

Within the snow and ice economy, the Matthew Effect principle remains evident. China's winter tourism visitors are increasingly concentrating in Xinjiang (where snow tourism reception accounts for over 30% of the nation's total winter tourism visits, making it the sole provincial-level region achieving exponential growth and creating a pronounced siphon effect). Visitors coming to Xinjiang for winter experiences are in turn heavily concentrated in Altay. (Altay Prefecture's winter tourism economy constitutes over 70% of its tertiary sector, earning it the title ‘China's Snow Capital’ jointly awarded by the General Administration of Sport and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism – the sole prefecture-level administrative region nationally to receive this designation). It is my assessment that China's winter tourism industry will soon enter a fiercely competitive phase, with local governments striving to retain domestic and international visitors. Naturally, this represents substantial benefits for consumers.

For instance, while Northeast China boasts its Ice and Snow World, Xinjiang has established the Changji Tingzhou Ice and Snow World. The Altay Resort in Xinjiang further offers paragliding, hot-air ballooning, and travel photography services. To integrate local characteristics, Bosten Lake has even developed a desert ski resort, all under the banner of ensuring visitors experience everything in one trip.

**Local Population and Income:**

Taking Altay Prefecture as an example, its permanent resident population stands at 668,587. The local skiing industry has generated nearly 9,000 jobs: Qinggeli Langshan Ski Resort directly employs 200 individuals and indirectly supports 5,000 entrepreneurial and employment opportunities). General Mountain Ski Resort alone has cumulatively welcomed 544,600 visitors, generating tourism revenue of ¥65.3776 million.

Homestays and Catering Sector: According to 2025 data, the tourism industry has significantly boosted the number of wholesale, retail, catering, and accommodation businesses in the Altay region. Current accommodation providers include 1,204 establishments with 43,036 guest rooms and 82,532 beds, alongside 43 star-rated hotels and 55 travel agencies. This sector directly employs 40,100 people and indirectly supports 160,000 jobs.

The aforementioned Hemu Village alone welcomed over 2 million visitors in 2024, with 11,800 available accommodation beds. For the new snow season (12 October 2025 to 30 March 2026), Altay's homestay bookings have doubled compared to the previous year.

The snow and ice economy has effectively enabled Xinjiang to achieve a year-round tourism revenue cycle, rather than relying solely on winter tourism to sustain the entire year.

**The Development of Xinjiang's Industries:**

Xinjiang supports the development of mass-market winter sports equipment in Urumqi City, Ili Prefecture, Altay Prefecture, and Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. This initiative promotes the enhancement of independent research, development, and production capabilities for skiing gear and protective equipment, providing manufacturing employment opportunities for local residents of all ethnicities.

The sustained growth of these industries relies heavily on infrastructure connectivity. While such development has undoubtedly improved local livelihoods and employment, reducing regional dependence on central government funding to some extent, I believe this represents only one aspect. The deeper significance lies in how this comprehensive development has intensified exchanges between China's frontier regions and the interior, while also deepening interactions between ethnic minorities and the Han majority. The movement of people, information, and cultural exchange between ethnic groups and regions is becoming increasingly normalised. a challenge that has perplexed successive Chinese dynasties and governments throughout history, is now gradually being explored and resolved.

**The preceding data demonstrates that the development of winter tourism enables domestic circulation of tourism expenditure throughout all four seasons. However, the exploration of tourism in Xinjiang involves deeper strategic considerations.**

Since President Trump initiated the trade war and began preparations for economic decoupling between China and the United States, the division into camps dominated by China and the United States (a new East-West alignment) has effectively commenced. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact camp led by Russia withdrew as the defeated party. and humanity's global environment enjoyed a golden era spanning nearly three decades. Yet now, all must confront an inescapable reality: an era of disorder has commenced. From the southern Tibet region to the South China Sea, from trade conflicts to direct control over Venezuela's vital oil supply, and China's recent ban on dual-use exports to Japan – these are all harbingers of a renewed alignment of global blocs.

As the greatest beneficiary of the post-Cold War era, the United States has reaped the dividends of a golden age. From a human perspective, spitting out what one has already tasted defies biological instinct. Therefore, one cannot harbour illusions that those with vested interests will gracefully step aside. The US military budget for 2027 has been explicitly raised to one and a half trillion dollars, This constitutes the most direct signal of preparatory steps towards full-scale conflict. However, as evidenced by President Trump's telephone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, decoupling will not unfold with extreme intensity but rather through gradual progression. The United States also seeks to avoid disrupting the pace of bloc formation. In the short term, before matters in South America are fully resolved, America will refrain from redirecting excessive focus towards East Asia. This explains Washington's recent stance following sanctions against Japan – urging Tokyo not to provoke China, as the United States remains unprepared for war with China.

China does not wish to initiate decoupling through overly aggressive means, as it has yet to complete its own preparations—be it economic or military—nor has it fully established its strategic alignment. Looking back to last year, the explicit designation of the domestic economic cycle as a strategic tool in mid-December signalled foresight: post-alignment, foreign trade would inevitably decline gradually. But to what extent? This remains unknown. Adopting a cautious approach, preparations for decoupling from America's core allies—Europe, the US, Japan, and South Korea—are essential. From 2026, national-level reforms addressing social security, pensions, and housing provident funds will commence. These efforts, alongside ongoing anti-corruption campaigns, lay long-term foundations for expanding domestic demand. **After all, stimulus funds target ordinary citizens, not corrupt officials.**

Tourism is primarily driven by young people as the market demand. Young Xinjiang residents are leveraging this trend to overcome delayed gratification. To cite the most minor example, brands like Heytea and Luckin Coffee have begun intensively expanding into Xinjiang. Including myself, I frequently travel to Xinjiang with company business via the China-Europe freight train. On its opening day at CCMALL, Luckin sold over 4,000 coffees, directly setting a new national record. McDonald's entered Xinjiang in 2020, approximately five years ahead of locations like Yinchuan, Ningxia (2025). Xinjiang's total retail sales of consumer goods grew by 5.3% year-on-year from January to August 2025. Young people's experiences and preferences serve as empirical evidence of humanity's progression from basic survival needs towards self-actualisation, addressing the contradiction between the people's ever-growing aspirations for a better life and the imbalance and inadequacy of development. Simultaneously, Xinjiang's winter sports market poses a challenge to Europe's dominance in this sector, serving as a means to retain winter spending domestically. Taking Switzerland alone as an example, Chinese tourists are projected to contribute approximately US$150 million (equivalent to around RMB 1.08 billion) during the 2024-25 winter season. Xinjiang's market is striving to retain this expenditure – or at least maximise its share – while also positioning itself to offer China's middle-class consumers an equivalent yet more economical domestic alternative once future market alignments crystallise.

Tourism stimulates regional economic growth, and it is undeniable that economic development contributes to regional stability to a certain extent. For instance, if you, as the leader of an extremist religious group, were to advocate that the rulers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait should personally lead the charge by strapping on bombs to carry out terrorist attacks, would you not expect these rulers to fly into a rage and hire mercenaries to slaughter your entire family? The impoverished class represents the most direct target for brainwashing by extremist religions. This demographic, plagued by educational deprivation, employment scarcity, and social marginalisation, coupled with weak governmental control in certain regions, renders them highly susceptible to terrorist organisations' influence. **The Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang has followed this very pattern, gradually disengaging this class from terrorist groups like the East Turkestan Islamic Movement.** This approach simultaneously addresses both the economic challenges and cultural issues within Xinjiang's peripheral regions. The rural poverty rate has fallen from 25.4% to 0%. Naturally, given the methodologies employed by statistical experts worldwide, any reasonable person would find this figure overly exaggerated. Examining income instead, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in impoverished areas rose from ¥5,090 in 2012 to ¥18,291 in 2024. Note that this figure pertains specifically to rural residents in impoverished areas, not the average income of Xinjiang's wealthiest individuals. Since 2024 alone, over 6 billion yuan has been allocated for industrial employment assistance. According to the summary data from Xinjiang's Poverty Alleviation Achievements, rural areas in the region have achieved a 100% safe housing rate and a 99% tap water coverage rate. power grid supply reliability reached 99.9%, 5G network coverage in administrative villages reached 92%, express delivery service coverage in administrative villages exceeded 96%, rural sanitary toilet coverage reached 63%, and domestic waste treatment rates reached 90%. **All these achievements required full support from Beijing, both in policy and economic terms.** Vigorously developing tourism can generate incremental income for Xinjiang, transforming barren regions lacking abundant natural resources into tourism-driven economies. Examples include Kashgar, Taxkorgan, Qiemo, and Hotan in southern Xinjiang.

**Economic interests serve as the most direct driving force behind ethnic exchange and inclusion, exerting influence far beyond mere propaganda slogans and ideological dissemination.** When people have secure housing and access to modern education, this constitutes the foundational logic underpinning the formation of the Chinese national community as espoused in propaganda. For instance, Han entrepreneurs in Kashgar and Ili partnering with ethnic minority merchants to jointly operate shops, sharing customer traffic, supply chains, and profits. Meanwhile, the influx of tourists into Xinjiang facilitated by improved transport links directly increases interactions between Han and Uyghur communities, or other ethnic groups. Such practical arrangements subtly shape national identity at a subconscious level, serving as the foundational pillar for regional security reinforcement. The tangible sense of national ideological belonging thus achieved proves more substantial than any slogan, propaganda or formulaic rhetoric. Consider a personal experience this summer in the ancient city: a young child from an ethnic minority persistently hounded my colleague and me to buy drinks. After multiple refusals, nearby adults from the same ethnic group intervened, shooing the child away and telling us not to mind them (though some Uyghur was mixed in, I didn't fully grasp it). There was no sign of the widely circulated online narrative about Uyghurs in Xinjiang colluding to target Han Chinese.

With the development of winter tourism, the East Turkestan terrorist organisation has also begun to focus its sustained attention on Xinjiang's winter tourism sector. **With hundreds of billions in funding and tens of millions of tourist visits, this scale of activity directly undermines the very foundations upon which terrorist organisations depend for survival.** Direct ethnic interaction shatters the separatists' narrative logic of ethnic division, while also causing American intelligence agencies to gradually reduce their investment in Xinjiang's fragmentation. Though they are in a hurry, their narrative logic appears unchanged – still the same old formula of population extermination + cultural extermination + concentration camps. Why do you lot have no bloody clue why Trump cut your funding? Because even the President doesn't buy your tired old three-point play anymore.

**Ultimately, the backdrop of history will always return to the ordinary individual. China is cultivating a consumer market for its middle class, while America's middle class has all but vanished.**Drawing lessons from the Cold War experience, the final outcome between China and the United States will hinge on internal strength – let us see which side implodes first.

Minute 6-8 quick damp mop where bare feet actually touch. kitchen + entryway that’s it.
Minute 9–10 look at the rest of the floor decide it’s “fine,” and leave.

Does it make the floor spotless? absolutely not 

Does it keep me from stepping on crumbs first thing in the morning? Yes, and that’s the bar.

Sometimes, when the person I'm speaking to speaks at a normal volume, I have difficulty making out their words, and I have to ask them to repeat what they said louder. I mean I need people to use a slightly louder voice than usual when they talk to me.

It's been 1,5 hours since I'm wearing them so I can have you questions.

* The music sound quality is always fine with all Samsung in-ear buds when you select Dynamic EQ and set your Adapt Sound profile, I never have complaints whether I'm listening to Metallica or The Weeknd or Mozart.
* Ambient sound is almost seemless like you're not wearing any earbuds. but when I turn on hearing aid in addition, crisp sounds like typing on a keyboard (both mine and my coworker's) or resting my coffee cup on glass table or the cloth friction noise while someone in front of me wearing their jacket or my own coughing is a bit ***too*** crisp.",1,1767948006.0,Earbuds,0,1.0,False

Our 7 year old DeLonghi basic Ecam died recently, so we thought we'd 'upgrade' to a Saeco, but the coffee is proving to be disappointing - not as strong as DL by a long shot (pun intended).

The coffee cakes are also quite watery afterwards, whereas in the DL they were solid - any setting I should be looking at to get a better coffee?

I've already dialed the grinder to a slightly coarser setting.

For reference, I normally do the strongest coffee at 150ml & on the hottest setting.

hey everyone, i figured i'd share some ideas for anyone living in a coastal spot who wants to bring in some extra cash. it's such a desirable location that you can really leverage it for income.  
  
first off, if you have any extra space like a driveway or garage that just sits empty, you should look into listing it on prked. honestly, it’s the easiest passive income ever. tourists or even locals going to the beach or harbor need a place to leave their car, and they’ll pay good money for a convenient spot. you just list your unused driveway or garage on the app, set your own price and schedule, and get paid. the setup is super easy and your car space is basically making money for you while you do nothing.  
  
for bigger things, short-term rentals are the biggest one. listing a guest room or a whole house on airbnb or vrbo during the peak season can make crazy money, sometimes enough to cover your yearly expenses. just make sure you check local ordinances because some towns are cracking down on short-term rentals. if you don’t want the hassle of turnovers, long-term rentals are a more stable passive income stream. also, coastal property tends to appreciate well because there's only so much waterfront, so it's a good investment in general.  
  
on the small business side, anything tourism related is great. you could run small eco-tours or beach clean-up tours, which a lot of people are into now. water-sport rentals like jet skis, kayaks, or even just beach chairs and umbrellas are huge moneymakers. for something smaller, a mobile food or coffee kiosk can do really well since there's always high foot traffic. think about service businesses too, like house sitting or property management for other second-home owners who aren't around all the time. they need someone local to check on their place, handle cleanings, and maintenance.  
  
you can also leverage your knowledge by running fishing tour services or offering professional beach photography sessions for families and couples. there's always someone on vacation wanting a nice photo.  
  
hope this helps you turn your ocean view into an income stream.",1,1767947821.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q831cb,https://github.com/erodola/bigram-metacpp,My C++ compiler just wrote its own fan-fiction (inference at compile-time),"Not really, but at least it generated its own main characters.

I've been obsessed with pushing language models into places they don't belong. Last summer it was a [1KB bigram model for the NES](https://github.com/erodola/bigram-nes) written in 6502 assembly. This week, I decided that even 1983 hardware was too much runtime for me.

So I built a bigram language model that runs entirely during the C++ compilation phase. 

Technically it's a Markov chain implemented via `constexpr` and template metaprogramming. The model's weights are hardcoded in an array. A fun part was implementing the random number generator: since compilers are (mostly) deterministic (rightfully so), I hashed `__TIME__` and `__DATE__` using an FNV-1a algorithm to seed a `constexpr` Xorshift32 RNG.

When you run the binary, the CPU does zero math. It just prints a string that was hallucinated by the compiler, different at each compile.

```cpp
    // this line does all the work while you're getting coffee
    static constexpr NameGenerator<15> result(seed, T); 

    int main() {
        // just printing a constant baked into the data segment
        std::cout << [result.name](http://result.name) << std::endl; 
    }
```

Aside from the fun of it, I hope it proves a point that the bottleneck isn't always our hardware. We have wiggle room to redefine when execution should happen, and bake deterministic inference directly into the binary.

That single dark purple (cottage cheese) was the one food on here that I am cutting out that I never liked. 

Dark red is absolutely never eat, have never eaten. I messed up but coffee is supposed to be part of that. 

Normally most fruits would be this (the thought of eating them would make my insides squirm), but recently I have tried a few and realized they were not that bad in a few forms (not good tho normally). Therefore I made them light pink, if I had tried it in some kind of form before and been ok or liked it. These included juice, in a dessert, part of a pastry, part of a sorbet, jam. But since fruits still generally gross me out they are in a separate category. 

Bright orangey/red: I generally don’t like these but there is like one way I like. 

Pinkish purple one is foods that I never had due to religious dietary/restrictions/my upbringing. I don’t consider this pickiness at all. 

Grey- only asparagus but something I just managed to never try. Don’t have any memories or feelings associated with. 

Bright/dark green- I generally like these. 

Greenish yellow- I could tolerate these but I generally avoid them. 

Light green- I like these in quite a few different forms but there might still be one or two ways I am a little uncomfortable with so I can’t say 100% like them. 

Light yellow- I like or am ok in a few forms but not in other forms. I don’t generally consider myself as ‘liking’ these foods on the whole. 

Orange- I can tolerate them, often in more than one way but I mostly don’t like them.

I was on the fence about if zucchini should be light yellow or orange. 

Looking back maybe some of these categories are redundant. It’s hard to say. But I feel like just using three categories is not helpful to me. This was actually kind of enlightening, while doing this I realized there were some foods I thought I really disliked but remembered I had actually had in one form that was ok or good.

All colour gone from my cheeks, and the cold weather making my nose tomato red. Endometriosis sucks, periods suck, periods in extremely cold weather suck the most. 

He had woken up before me, made poha because I'm a Marathi mulgi at heart that way, the coffee was brewing. It was my turn to do the dishes last night, but lethargy had taken over because of the heavy bleeding. I fell asleep, but it was the restless kind of sleep. I woke up feeling worse than before. And I knew I had to do the dishes. I walked into the kitchen and....the dishes were done, dried, put away neatly. The kitchen counter was cleaned the way I like it, and the cleaning cloth was boiled in hot water and put out for drying in the sun. The way I prefer it, ofc. 

We had breakfast together listening to KK songs. I thanked him for taking care of all the chores. And for the poha. With dhaniya. Dhaniya which he grew in our balcony because I love to garnish all dishes with dhaniya, and he calls me dhaniya devi. 

Before leaving, he said what he always says, ""Call me if you need anything. And don't look too pretty, okay?"" I laughed and said I only look pale and fatigued. ""Not even a little bit"", a kiss on the cheek, and he left. 

I walked back to the mirror and looked at myself again. The food and rest actually helped, a little colour was back in my cheeks. And the lingering smile from his words and gestures was still on my face - he was right, I looked pretty. Not because of my looks or anything else. Only because I was/am happy. 

To the partners who are always there, no matter what - thank you. You make the world a better place. It is seen, felt, and appreciated. ",230,1767947341.0,AskIndianWomen,27,0.97,False

I like it, coz it's quiet,  no one's here to bother me (a.k.a. ask to do work which I'm paid to do, lol). 

I had only 5 hours of sleep (better than the night before which was barely 4 hrs), so I knew I needed to have some coffee with me. I refuse to start making coffee at work, I don't even want to know how the fancy coffee machine works coz I know once I open that floodgate, I'd be drinking 3-4 coffees a day. But this doesn't mean I cannot have one coffee brought from home in my thermal mug. 

So, even though I was already running late, I made sure to make a coffee, warm up and froth some milk and now, sitting in the quiet half-lit office and waiting for the daylight, I am slowly sipping my coffee.

I am very grateful to have these few moments of peace. Soon, people will start arriving and I'm gonna have to act busy, but for now, I can just breathe. ",22,1767947240.0,BenignExistence,5,0.97,False

And tried doing it all at once and made myself so miserable that on the first sign of a binge I just gave up. Listened to alot of advice that blamed it on anything other than I was eating 3k+ calories a day and incredibly sedentary 4 days a week (work in healthcare)...

So this time I want to do it right and am approaching this as making sustainable changes and using little swaps instead of going crazy....here is what I have so far...looking for other suggestions as well.

1. Coffee and liquid calories: i love coffee and flavored drinks so instead of getting that 500 cal $8 latte, I am making it as close as I can af home with sugar free syrups and low cal creamer.  Saving $ and calories while not taking something completely away that has become part of my self care (cup of coffee, a fuzzy blanket and a book in the sun)... I substitute other drinks with sugar free and add low cal packets to my waters instead so I dont feel deprived and am hydrated.
2. Readjusted my mind frame from working out and eating healthy is special to it is what I do just like going to work and paying bills, its not special its just what I do.
3. Doing workouts I enjoy like walking and lifting weights are better for me long term because I will actually do them instead of following the latest fitness trend that I will quit in 2 weeks.
4. I am not going overboard about what I can eat and am prioritizing nutrition over fad diets. I cut calories where I can and make smart choices while still allowing myself treats. This will hopefully reduce my urge to binge this time if triggers are no longer thr forbidden precious and naughty and instead are just there.
5. I had an appointment with my Dr and got an honest picture of my health (not great but not horrendous) not just my pant size and am shopping for a dietician to work with instead of social media influencefs leading me further into bad eating habbits ​
6. have told no one that i am losing weight currently. I have found that people can be dicks when they know and this is better for.  better for me mentally too.

I was scrolling through my phone when I stumbled upon a confession post.

""Truth is, when my parents adopted me, I already knew their real daughter was in the same orphanage as I was. But I didn't dare tell them. I was terrified that I'd lose my new home and be left behind—to be molested by the director.

""Now that Mom and Dad favor me and treat her like trash, the guilt is eating me alive. How can I make it up to her?""

In my last life, I realized the poster was Gabriella Marquez—the one who had been living my life. Devastated, I dragged my crippled right leg out the door to confront her.

But that very night, she crumbled under the pressure and jumped to her death.

Mom and Dad blamed me for everything. They lost it, screaming that I should pay with my life. Only my adopted brother, Vincent Marquez, stood by me.

He took me away to live with him.

But he refused to take me to the shrink, torturing me every single day.

""You drove Gabby to her death. You killed a living, breathing human being with your own hands. You're going to spend the rest of your life paying for it,"" he said.

Eventually, I spiraled into a severe depression and jumped off the building, just like Gabriella had years before.

When I opened my eyes again, I found myself back on the day I found that post.

The netizens thought Gabriella was just fishing for attention to build up an account, leaving all sorts of unhinged comments.

She kept updating the thread.

""Mom and Dad raised me for eighteen years. They couldn't bear to send me away, so they let me stay and live as their daughter's sister.

""The girl and I met when we were five, and we became best friends at the orphanage. But I was scared that if her parents recognized her, they wouldn't want me. So when her parents arrived, I tricked her into playing hide-and-seek and told her to hide.

""I tried to find her later, but she'd already been adopted. Her life has been tough. She's crippled now, skin and bones.

""I heard her foster family was trash; they beat her, screamed at her, and neglected her. They even made her drop out of middle school to fend for herself.

""Meanwhile, I grew up in luxury, having everything I needed. If I so much as sneezed, Mom, Dad, and my brother would anxiously call the family doctor. And I went to a top private high school. I really owe her an apology...""

In my past life, reading those words was what made me snap.

How could I not hate her?

On my first day back with the Marquez family, Mom hugged me and cried, while Dad—usually so stern—had tears in his eyes. My adopted brother Vincent gently stroked my hair.

We should have been happy.

But then Gabriella appeared.

She was wearing a beautiful dress and a diamond necklace I had only ever seen in advertisements—delicate and elegant, like a princess.

I instinctively looked down.

My right leg, crippled from a beating by my foster father, could barely support my malnourished body.

My cheap market clothes smelled weird from overuse, and there was black lint stuck under my fingernails.

Why did a thief get to live like royalty while I struggled just to stay alive?

I started to loathe Gabriella.

She had changed so much that I hadn't realized she was Abby from the orphanage.

After I got lost when I was five, a kind stranger had dropped me off there.

We were always hungry and cold. The director, Phillip Hoffman, was mean, but he was always kind to Abby.

Every time Phillip took Abby away to play ""games"" and brought her back, she would have a bag of snacks.

I wanted snacks too, so I asked her how to play.

She told me, ""The game isn't fun at all. It hurts, and it smells bad. I can share whatever you want to eat with you.

""But don't get clean. If you're clean, Mr. Hoffman might force you to go play games.""

I believed her, so I stayed unkempt every day.

Then, six months later, Abby suddenly wanted to play hide-and-seek with me.

By the time I finally came out of the closet, the night had fallen.

She had been adopted by a wealthy family.

Back then, I was happy for my friend.

But it turned out she had told me to hide simply so she could steal my parents.

When that bloody truth was revealed in my past life, I went insane and attacked Gabriella like a madwoman.

The commotion drew Mom, Dad, and Vincent.

When Mom and Dad learned that Gabriella was the reason I had been separated from them for thirteen years, they couldn't believe their sweet daughter could be so malicious.

Gabriella cried and apologized over and over, ""I'm sorry, Cecilia. I ruined your life. I'm so sorry...""

Not long after, Gabriella jumped from the building and died right in front of me.

Mom and Dad, who had been furious at her deception, broke down the moment they saw her body.

Mom grabbed me by the collar.

""Gabby didn't do anything wrong. She was just terrified of what the director might do to her! She just wanted parents to protect her! Why did you have to expose her and drive her to death?

""Give her back to me!""

Then what had I done to deserve all that suffering?

At the best age of my life, I had been turned into a cripple.

To survive, I rummaged through trash bins for food. I wore the same pair of shoes from spring through winter.

Did dying automatically make her innocent?

I forgot how I left the Marquez's house that day. I only remember Vincent hugging me, separating me from Mom and Dad.

His embrace was as warm as his voice.

""Don't be afraid. You've got me.""

But even his existence was something Gabriella had wished for—she had wanted a brother.

Vincent settled me into his apartment and wiped away my tears.

""You'll live with me from now on.""

But Gabriella's death became my nightmare.

When I woke up screaming in the night, Vincent would hold me tight and soothe me softly.

""Don't be scared, I'm right here.

""I'll find a movie for you to watch. Just distract yourself and stop thinking about those things.""

But scenes of falling in movies only terrified me more.

Vincent then switched to opera.

The soaring voices grated on my nerves.

I could only feel a moment of peace when I gripped Vincent's hand.

I relied on him completely, like he was my lifeline.

Love began to grow amidst the despair.

Yet my mental state continued to deteriorate, so I tried to save myself.

""Take me to see a psychiatrist tomorrow.""

Vincent refused.

He leaned close to my ear and asked gently, ""When Gabby died, her head was smashed open. Have you thought about how much pain she was in?

""Do you remember? She was apologizing to you right before she died. Do you forgive her in your dreams every night?

""Cecilia, you are a murderer.

""You drove Gabby to her death. You killed a living person with your own hands. You have to spend your entire life atoning for it.""

It turned out Vincent didn't take me away because he knew I was innocent. He did it to torture me and avenge Gabriella.

So, this time, I closed the post and pretended I hadn't seen it.

I didn't want to be a sinner again.

I would use the Marquez family's influence to climb up.

Then, I would leave this place forever and live the life I actually wanted.

I was the only person I could rely on.

So, I went downstairs and told Mom, ""I want to go back to school.""

Chapter 2

When I first arrived home, Mom had suggested I transfer to Gabriella's high school.

Back then, I hated her, and I was terrified of getting made fun of for my limp, so I flat-out refused.

But now that I was the one bringing it up, Mom was thrilled.

""That's wonderful. Now Gabby will have company at school.

""And Cece, you've missed so much schoolwork—Vince is a freshman in college, so he can tutor you. Just ask him if you need help.""

Vincent was sitting nearby, watching TV.

At the mention of his name, he looked up.

He still had that gentle look I remembered.

But I wanted nothing to do with him, so I shook my head.

""No need to bother Vince. I can just ask the teachers.""

Vincent lowered his gaze, his lashes dipping slightly. ""Suit yourself.

""Let's eat.""

Gabriella came downstairs and sat stiffly across from me.

As Mom set our plates down, beaming about me going back to school, Gabriella's face went slightly pale.

""It's good that Cece is willing to learn. I'll look out for her at school...""

I cut her off quietly.

""Mom, I can't eat celery. I'm allergic.""

I'd discovered that the hard way while working odd jobs. Once, I was so hungry I ate a customer's leftovers, only to break out in a rash and struggle to breathe.

The terrified shop owner had called an ambulance.

Afterward, he docked my pay for disrupting business.

Mom froze, then hurriedly picked the celery out of my plate. ""That's my fault. I'll remember next time.

""Here, Gabby, you eat it. You love celery.""

But instead of giving it to her directly, she set the piece aside and picked a fresh stalk for Gabriella—as if my plate had contaminated it.

Mom picked up a piece of fish, carefully removing the bones, and teased Gabriella.

""You need a bite of meat after that celery, or you won't get a balanced diet.""

The affection that should have been mine landed on Gabriella instead.

Gabriella watched my reaction cautiously.

I just stuffed my mouth with meat.

The imitation beef I used to eat was soft and lacked any real flavor.

It was nothing like this—firm, tender, and savory.

I ate quickly.

Suddenly, a pork rib was sitting on my plate.

Vincent had put it there.

""The ribs are good, too. Don't just stick to the beef.""

I stiffened, not daring to touch it.

My mind immediately jumped to the worst conclusion. Was there something wrong with the rib?

My nose felt hot.

He was quick, reaching out with a tissue to wipe the blood from my nose.

I panicked, standing up and backing away.

The legs of my chair scraped harshly against the floor, drawing Mom's attention.

I stammered, ""I'm full.""

As I ran upstairs, I heard Vincent's low voice talking to the maid.

""Debra, Cece might be feeling unwell. Prepare something light for her so she feels better.""

That was Vincent—always considerate.

Since my return, even without any real bond between us, he was always checking to see if I was adjusting, if I was warm enough.

That was why, in my previous life, I never suspected that his kindness concealed hatred.

But it didn't matter. This time around, Gabriella wouldn't die.

And I wouldn't have a mental breakdown and jump off a building.

Enrollment happened fast.

By Monday morning, I was set to go to school with Gabriella.

She came to my room holding an orange shopping bag with a backpack inside.

I recognized the brand from my food delivery days—customers wore them. Hermès. Very expensive.

""Cece, your bag is a little small. High school has a heavy workload, so your things won't fit. This one is new. You can use it.""

Since the day I returned, Gabriella had found excuses to give me expensive gifts.

I used to think she was showing off, so I always refused coldly.

Now I realized it was compensation—guilt for stealing my life.

This time, I accepted it without hesitation, already calculating its resale value.

After all, money didn't lie.

Gabriella left, her steps noticeably lighter once she saw that I hadn't rejected her.

I carried the bag downstairs, ready for school.

As I passed the living room, Mom stopped me.

""Cece, you like Hermès, too?

""If you like it, Mom can buy you one, but you can't steal...""

She coughed lightly, softening her tone. ""You can't take Gabby's bag.""

I paused. ""Gabriella gave this to me.""

""Impossible. That limited edition is Gabby's treasure. She barely ever uses it. I once teased her about giving it away, and she cried.""

Gabriella came downstairs just then. Hearing Mom, she hurriedly confirmed it.

""I did give it to Cece.""

Mom didn't understand. ""But don't you love that bag?""

""I...""

Gabriella stammered, afraid to speak the truth.

Her hesitation made Mom misunderstand; she thought I'd coerced her. Mom's face darkened.

Then Vincent walked over.

""Gabby really did give it to her. I heard them upstairs just now.""

Gabriella nodded immediately. ""Exactly. Vince can be my witness.""

But Vincent had been downstairs with Mom the whole time.

Mom sighed. ""You two are just too soft-hearted.

""Fine, let's drop it.""

The matter was lightly brushed aside, leaving me branded a thief.

I clenched my fists and didn't argue.

Mom wouldn't believe me anyway.

They were Gabriella's family. Whatever I did was wrong in their eyes, so why bother speaking?

Later, I found a pawn shop and sold the bag for 200 thousand dollars, an amount I couldn't earn in a lifetime of hard labor.

Being treated as a thief was worth it.

Chapter 3

School wasn't the nightmare I'd pictured.

My classmates knew about my leg and went out of their way to look out for me.

As a result, Gabriella steered clear, pretending we were total strangers.

I had no interest in stirring up drama about who the biological daughter was and who wasn't.

She took the front row; I took the corner.

We stayed in our lanes.

It stayed that way until the final bell. I hung back to ask the teacher a question.

By the time I walked out, Gabriella and the driver were gone, but Vincent was waiting at the gate.

""I told them to go ahead.

""Mom found out about you selling the bag. She's furious.

""Dad got back from his business trip and heard about it, too.

""Just admit you messed up when we get home. I'll speak up for you, and they won't be too hard on you.""

I suddenly couldn't get a read on Vincent.

Given his personality, he should have been echoing Mom and Dad, tearing into me for selling Gabriella's bag. Helping me find a way out was completely out of character.

Had he been reborn, too?

Vincent reached for my backpack, but I instinctively dodged him.

""I get it. But I need to pick up some supplies, so you go ahead, Vince. I can take a cab.""

I turned and hurried away, my limp breaking my stride.

It didn't matter if he had lived this life before or not.

This time around, he could protect Gabriella, and I would walk my own path. We would have nothing to do with each other.

When I got home, the air was thick enough to choke on.

Mom and Dad's expressions were grim. The backpack sat on the coffee table like an accusation.

Gabriella sat primly to the side, looking at me with guilt in her eyes.

I hadn't realized her attempt to make amends would trigger such a mess.

Mom was the first to snap.

""Cecilia, Vince and Gabby lied for you today, so I didn't expose you for stealing earlier. But how could you sell it?

""That is Gabby's most prized possession!

""If I hadn't seen it while shopping and bought it back, Gabby would be heartbroken all over again because of you!""

Dad tossed a debit card onto the table, his voice cold.

""The Marquez family hasn't fallen so low that we need to sell bags. If word got out, people would think we were mistreating our own biological daughter.

""From now on, I'll transfer your allowance to this card. Don't let this happen again. But you need to apologize to Gabby.

""You were in the wrong.""

I didn't know how much money was on the card.

My options were clear—apologize, take the money, and keep the peace.

Or lash out, expose Gabriella, and prove my innocence.

It felt like a lose-lose situation.

So, I made my choice.

""I'm sorry, Gabriella. I shouldn't have stolen your bag and sold it.""

I lowered my head, slumping my shoulders in submission, and picked up the card.

Pride and backbone had disappeared long ago, back when I was poor.

What use was innocence?

When I was starving, unable to pay tuition, or terrified of getting sick... those abstract concepts were trash.

Having money, studying hard, and fighting for my future—that was what mattered.

My attitude was sincere enough, and Mom and Dad's expressions softened.

""As long as you know you were wrong.

""Get along with Gabby from now on; don't let this cause a rift.""

Gabriella looked like she was sitting on pins and needles. She couldn't even meet my gaze before she found an excuse to run upstairs.

Mom grabbed the bag and chased after her.

""Gabby, don't be sad. I checked it; it's not dirty or broken. I'll take you to buy a new one tomorrow to make up for it, okay?""

Her voice faded down the hall.

Calmly, I linked the card to my phone and checked the balance. It was more than I would have made selling the bag.

Not a bad deal.

Once I graduated and got into college, I could move out of the Marquez's house and live on my own.

Vincent blocked my way as I headed to my room.

""You clearly weren't in the wrong. Why did you apologize?

""It was your property; you had the right to do whatever you wanted with it.""

I answered softly, ""Vince, you were the one who told me to admit my mistake in the first place.""

Vincent stiffened, pressing his lips into a tight line.

Just as I was closing the door, he suddenly asked.

""Cece, do you hate me?

""You seem to always be avoiding me.""

""No.""

I just wanted to stay as far away from you as possible.

I shut the door.

Vincent's face disappeared from view.

Because of the bag incident, Gabriella felt even more guilty.

I didn't accuse her or make snide remarks; I simply weaponized that guilt to make her tutor me every day.

I had fallen too far behind in my classes.

I preferred Gabriella to Vincent.

At least when I was with her, I wasn't afraid.

I powered through practice questions day and night.

In the blink of an eye, the SATs were just around the corner.

I wasn't sure what result a year of grinding would yield, but I had to try.

After several sleepless nights, I wasn't in good shape. My head felt heavy and dull.

I held on until the final subject.

Suddenly, blood poured from my nose, and a blinding pain hit me.

I tried to raise my hand to call the proctor.

Then, I collapsed onto the desk and lost consciousness.

I woke up in the hospital.

The proctor had been kind enough to call an ambulance.

The doctor looked at me with the most pity I had ever seen on a human face.

""Where are your parents?""

They were at Gabriella's exam site.

We hadn't been assigned to the same location.

After Dad and Vincent picked me up on the first day, I hadn't seen them since.

""They don't have time to come,"" I said. ""You can tell me, Doc. I'm an adult.""

When I was poor, I was terrified of getting sick. Now I had money, so I thought I had nothing to fear.

But when the doctor said the words ""late-stage leukemia,"" a buzzing sound filled my ears, drowning out everything else.

Chapter 4

I thought about the cheap rental I'd been living in to save cash, the clothes with a pungent smell I'd bought to keep me warm...

A wave of dizziness hit me.

I heard myself ask, ""Is there a cure?""

""It's late-stage. We can try, but a bone marrow transplant is your only real shot. You can start chemotherapy for now. Every extra day you live is a victory.""

I'd seen chemo patients before.

Shaved heads, tubes everywhere, hollow eyes.

It was the kind of sickness where money didn't guarantee survival.

I didn't know how I walked out of that hospital. Instinct took over. I called Mom.

But she wouldn't pick up.

I tried Dad's number.

And he wouldn't pick up either.

Finally, I called Gabriella.

She answered fast. The background was chaotic—laughter, someone complaining about how hard the exams were this year.

Through the noise, I heard my parents.

""Our baby girl is finally free! Let's go! Dad's taking you to your favorite spot to celebrate!""

""Look at the graduation gift Mom got you. It's that clover jewelry set you wanted.""

""Hold on, Mom, Dad. It's a classmate on the phone.""

Gabriella lied.

She walked to a quiet corner before speaking.

""What is it?""

""I'm at the hospital. I can't reach Mom and Dad. Can you tell them...""

""Cece,"" Gabriella cut me off.

""For over a year, I've stepped back for you. Food, clothes, jewelry—you pick first, I take the scraps. I even gave up our weekly family days so they would take you out.

""But today isn't just about exams; it's my coming-of-age party. It matters. Can't you let me have our parents for just one day?

""I know you're supposed to be in the exam hall, so don't lie to me.

""Please, I'm begging you.""

The line went dead.

Gabriella was an orphan. She didn't have a birthday of her own, so she hijacked mine.

I called back, but the connection failed.

Mom and Dad never returned my calls.

It was like they had forgotten I existed.

The tears I'd been holding back finally spilled.

I stared blankly at the four contacts in my phone until a notification popped up.

Gabriella had updated her social media.

She was sitting between Mom and Dad, wearing a birthday crown, beaming with joy.

Vincent stood behind them, his arms resting on our parents' shoulders.

The caption was short, ""Happy Birthday.""

Three hours and fifteen minutes had passed.

They hadn't thought of me for a single second.

Why?

I just wanted to live a decent life.

Why was I the one with the limp? Why was I the one who was sick? Why did I have to suffer while the thief who stole my life got to be happy?

I slammed the medical report onto the pavement.

I hailed a cab and went straight to the restaurant.

I was going to expose Gabriella. I wanted Mom and Dad to see that their ""perfect daughter"" was a despicable thief!

If I couldn't be happy, neither could she.

But I was too late.

They were already gone.

I went to call them again, only to realize Mom had sent a text thirty minutes ago.

""Cece, things got crazy today. We forgot to pick you up. We'll celebrate your birthday tomorrow.

""Dad sent you some money.""

It was a transfer notification for 100 thousand dollars.

Then I saw Vincent's texts.

""Where are you?""

""The proctor said you went to the hospital. Are you sick?""

""Mom and Dad took Gabby to the movies. They probably won't be home tonight. I bought a cake. I'll celebrate with you.""

I switched back to Mom's chat.

I stared at the messages and suddenly started laughing.

They took Gabriella out to have fun and lied to my face about it. Why couldn't they just tell the truth?

They just didn't love me.

The anger that had been building inside me dissolved.

""Forget it,"" I told myself.

I never got what I wanted anyway.

I decided to spend the rest of my life doing exactly what I wanted.

I blocked everyone.

I didn't go back to the villa.

I bought a ticket home.

The family that adopted me years ago lived in a small town.

My adoptive father, Jacob Baldwin, couldn't have children, so he adopted me to save face.

But he was an alcoholic, a gambler, and an abuser.

Whenever things went south, he took it out on me and his wife, Luella Baldwin.

""You eat my food, you drink my water! I'll beat you if I want! You take it!

""Why is a useless thing like you in high school? Get out and earn money! I've fed you for ten years! Pay me back!""

Luella was timid. She swallowed her pride in front of him but acted tough with me.

""Why do you eat so much? Do you know how expensive meat is?

""Go wash the clothes! We adopted you to work, not to be a princess!""

Until one day, Jacob looked at me and said, ""You've grown up to be quite pretty, you wretched girl. Hodge's wife just died, and he needs a new one. He'll take you for 4,000 dollars.""

Hodge was a filthy old man.

I refused to marry him.

That day, Jacob broke my leg. He screamed that even if I was a cripple, I was going to marry Hodge.

Luella grabbed him and held on tight.

""Cece, run!""

I ran.

I lived on the streets for three years before the Marquez family found me.

Relying on memory, I walked through the darkness toward that single-story house.

Jacob was drunk and getting ready to go out and gamble.

Luella was trying to stop him.

From across the yard, I could hear her pathetic pleading. ""That money is for the rent. The landlord comes tomorrow. Can't you wait a few days?""

""Get lost! I earned this money!

""I'll spend it however I want! Stop me again, and I'll beat you to death!""

I heard the sounds of a struggle, followed by Luella's quiet sobbing. Jacob stumbled out of the house.

I followed him silently.

Jacob played cards in an abandoned workshop in town.

To get there, you had to cross the dam.

The further we walked, the quieter it got. My footsteps sounded loud in the silence. Jacob seemed to sense something and turned his head.

I lunged forward and shoved him.

In the blink of an eye, he vanished into the water.

My chest felt tight, but I had never felt such relief.

I had avenged myself for two lifetimes.

I used to be so afraid of consequences. But now that I was dying, I had nothing to fear.

I pulled my hat down low and turned to leave, but a pair of shoes stepped into my vision.

I looked up.

Vincent was standing there.

# What is Kilo Code

Kilo Code is an AI-powered coding environment that works directly inside VS Code.

Think of it as a full-time developer that never gets tired, never complains, and never misses a deadline.

You can write, debug, review, and deploy inside Kilo Code — all powered by AI.

It works like an AI layer built on top of your workflow.

When you type, it understands your intent.

When you hit a bug, it fixes it.

When you describe a task, it builds it.

It’s like having an expert coder in your pocket 24/7.
