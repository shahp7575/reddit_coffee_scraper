Besides not owning up to what she says, she makes everything about her and how she feels. Ex) When Garcelle told the group that she doesn't feel comfortable talking about her children around them. Dorit gets soooo offended and makes it about her feelings instead of considering why Garcelle might feel that way.

I know this sounds extreme (and trust me, I was well aware of the risks), but I felt like I had no other choice.



For context, I was 241 lbs at 5‚Äô11, and my self-esteem was at rock bottom. I hated looking in the mirror. I avoided photos. Even walking up the stairs left me out of breath. I tried every diet out there‚Äîketo, OMAD, calorie counting‚Äîbut I‚Äôd binge every time. It felt like I had zero self-control. Then, I came across extended fasting, and I saw some insane transformations. People talking about how it reset their relationship with food, helped with discipline, and most importantly, shredded weight fast.



So, I went all in. Only water, black coffee, and electrolytes.



The First Week ‚Äì Hell

The first three days were the worst. My stomach was screaming for food, I had headaches nonstop, and I felt like I was going to pass out every time I stood up. I almost quit on day 4‚ÄîI dry-heaved over the toilet because my body was so desperate for food. But I told myself, ""Just make it to one week.""



By day 7, the hunger surprisingly disappeared. My energy was weirdly stable, but my body felt weak. The craziest part? I had already lost 16 lbs. Just seeing that number on the scale kept me going.



Days 10-30 ‚Äì Autopilot

By the second week, I was in deep ketosis. My face started slimming down fast, and I felt... sharp? I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but my brain was running differently. It was like my body realized food wasn't coming anytime soon, so it stopped begging for it.



At the three-week mark, I had lost about 35 lbs. My clothes were falling off me. People at school started noticing. I told them I was doing ‚Äúintermittent fasting‚Äù because I knew they‚Äôd freak out if I said the truth.



Days 31-50 ‚Äì The Hardest Part

I won‚Äôt lie‚Äîthis is when it got brutal. My sleep got worse. My body felt cold all the time. And the worst part? The fatigue. I started feeling this deep, bone-level exhaustion. Even standing for too long made me lightheaded. My legs felt weak, almost like they weren‚Äôt mine. I‚Äôd get random dizzy spells, and climbing stairs felt like a full workout. At one point, I remember dropping my phone and just staring at it for a full minute because I didn‚Äôt have the energy to bend down and pick it up.



I also started doubting myself. Was this even worth it? I was losing weight, but I felt frail. Walking long distances made my legs feel like jelly. My resting heart rate dropped to mid-40s, and my hands were always freezing. I knew this wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúhealthy way‚Äù to lose weight, but I was so close.



Days 51-60 ‚Äì The Finish Line

By this point, I was just coasting on momentum. I had come so far that quitting wasn‚Äôt an option. I stopped feeling real hunger‚Äîit was more like mental cravings. I‚Äôd watch food videos for HOURS just to feel something.



When I finally hit day 60, I stepped on the scale and saw 171 lbs. A 70-lb loss in two months. I almost cried. Not just because of the weight loss, but because I actually followed through.



Aftermath & Reflections

Refeeding was scary. My first meal was bone broth and watermelon, but even that made my stomach cramp. I had to ease back in super slowly to avoid refeeding syndrome.

The weight loss slowed down after eating again, but I kept most of it off. My body filled out a bit, but I never rebounded.

I don‚Äôt recommend this to anyone. I did it knowing it wasn‚Äôt safe. I felt weak, my hair started shedding, and my hormones were probably wrecked. But for me, it was the only way to break the cycle.

Now, I‚Äôm focusing on strength training and eating clean. My relationship with food is still a work in progress, but at least I feel in control now.



If you have any questions, ask away. I know this was extreme, but I just wanted to share my journey.

$8k in CC debt from random shit, mostly overspent because I got an apartment I can't really afford and had to pay for some dental things out of pocket after 2 botched crowns.... Split between Chase Southwest card 21.9% APR @ $4,200 ($240ish min monthly), Discover College Credit Card at 16% APR @ $3,000 ($154 min), and a CareCredit at 20% APR @ $800 ($30 min monthly). I've whittled this down from $11k.

I take home $3400 a month after taxes and health insurance and expect about $7k in side hustle income after taxes this year (variable by month), $1550 in rent on a place I share with my sis, about $200 in utilities, $300 in car/dental/vision insurance, about $400 in groceries (my state is expensive ok), about $300 in necessities /doctor/things like that. Own my car but it's getting older and just hit 200mi. 

I've stopped using all cards altogether, cut out non-necessities other than things I really love (Netflix), started all my seeds for my garden so I can grow a lot more foods, I stopped getting my hair and nails done, don't eat out really all that much besides my once a week coffee treat and once a week eat out lunch.

I've seen a lot about the snowball method, but since the APR on the Chase card is so high, I've just been throwing everything I can at it, and just pay the mins on the other 2. I know it's probably the best thing to do, but it feels like I'm making so little progress.

Do I just keep doing what I'm doing? Follow the Avalanche or snowball method actually? Or try and do a balance transfer on another card? Or something else I haven't considered? My credit score also sucks, it's 640 so worried about future needs like a car loan when my car shits out/apartment approvals...so I just keep making my payments and try to set a little aside here and there for an emergency fund, but it's small, only like $1000 in savings.

1j51tti,https://www.reddit.com/r/rs_x/comments/1j51tti/only_one_person_turned_up_to_my_birthday_party/,"Only one person turned up to my birthday party, turning it into the weirdest day of my life.","Just to clarify, I have a lot of friends at work. Or, at least, I thought I did. Last year I had an outing with around 5 of them, so I thought I'd invite some people this year. I wanted to get my mind off a breakup with the guy I thought I was going to marry. Except nobody turned up other than the new girl at the office, who I didn't even really invite, she invited herself after overhearing me invite my friend. She‚Äôs was very quiet at work, she didn‚Äôt talk to anybody, and none of us really knew anything about her, but I wasn‚Äôt going to be rude so when she asked, I said we‚Äôd be happy to have her there. 

So, it's just us two at a half empty bowling alley (it was late on a work night). She turned up late, I was about to leave thinking nobody was coming, when she comes in with a Tesco bag. She did a bit of shopping before and got me a present. She bought me a frozen cheesecake; and we're here for some time so it'll probably melt before I get home. Still, I'm grateful, even if it‚Äôs an odd gift, and I feel a little better that at least one person turned up, although I feel quite awkward as I only spoke to her a few times and she seemed very odd, definitely on the spectrum. She‚Äôs not exactly ugly, but she‚Äôs quite odd looking and stands out, quite scrawny and tiny, no makeup, hairy arms, greasy long hair, odd dress sense, etc. She smells a little, not terrible but there‚Äôs a slight whiff of something unpleasant coming off her, not like BO exactly but like she doesn‚Äôt wash her clothes enough. Since being in work, she had changed into a t-shirt that was comically oversized, it looked as if she had printed a photo of some random old woman on the t-shirt but had done a bad job as the picture was faded and coming off the shirt. She had a pendant on that looked really nice, I complimented it and she told me a guy gave it to her at a hospice she was volunteering at. Apparently, he had no family and wanted to give it to her because she was volunteering as a friend at the hospice, where they have coffee and talk with some of the patients there. 

We started bowling, she was reasonably quiet for the first few minutes but she got giddy really fast, a complete 180 from how she acts at work. She was shouting all the time, laughing, going on random tangents without finishing them, acting like a kid although she was born in the mid 90‚Äôs so she must be at least in her late 20‚Äôs. She was just plain awful at the game too, I was trying to help her but she was useless, just throwing the bowl haphazardly to the point where I was worried she was going to damage something. She had like three cola‚Äôs during this time which may have made her more giddy, and she was just loudly belching to the point where I felt embarrassed and some of the families there were giving her dirty looks. 

Things are going quite well despite that, when suddenly a guy comes up to us. I think he‚Äôs the manager or maybe he just works there, but he tells her that she can‚Äôt wear the shoes she‚Äôs wearing and that she should have swapped. She apologized but the guy was being very rude. Anyway, she comes back after swapping her shoes and starts cussing the guy out, telling me how much she hates rude people, tells me that men are so rude, that she‚Äôs glad she‚Äôs gay, etc.

We were about to finish anyway, when she suddenly started whispering to me that she had an idea. She pulled out from her shopping bag a loose cabbage and starts giggling. I realize what she‚Äôs about to do, and tell her not to, but she just laughs and all of a sudden, she launches the cabbage across the lane. It goes flying with leaves coming off before it goes into another lane that is in use. A woman with her kids turns to us and shouts something, before stomping off and returning with the manager. The girl is just laughing her head off, almost laying down over the seats as people look at the commotion. I‚Äôm laughing a little too but worried because I see the same guy from before coming over. 

The girl shouts ‚Äúrun‚Äù and starts to run away but stops almost immediately, probably realizing that she left her shoes at the desk. The guy is super pissed, shouts at us both and basically bans us from ever coming back. I‚Äôm mortified but the girl looks like she‚Äôs trying not to laugh as he‚Äôs telling her off like a child. At one point he shouts ‚Äúit‚Äôs not funny‚Äù and she made a really bad cabbage pun that made no sense that just made him even angrier, he was a big guy and he was turning purple with rage. 

After getting kicked out, she offered me a ride home. Her car is an absolute mess, fast food wrappers strewn about the floor, smelling strongly of stale food. Turns out she lives near me, living in a council house with her grandmother (the same one on her t-shirt, presumably). She‚Äôs still super giddy, and a terrible driver, not using indicators, switching lanes without checking for traffic, going over a curb at one point, etc. But we get to my house in one piece and at that point I just want to go to bed, but we‚Äôre parked up and she‚Äôs still talking. I manage to leave after about 5 minutes of her talking. She leaps over the seat and hugs me suddenly, before telling me that I should come to her house in the future. She says that her grandmother is a great cook and will be happy for a guest.

Not sure how to feel, a very odd day. I‚Äôm upset with my friends for not turning up, but most had somewhat reasonable excuses. At the same time, I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about the girl. She seems very lonely but she‚Äôs also just plain odd, very autistic. At work we don‚Äôt sit together but she‚Äôs started sitting with me when I have my lunch (I usually eat alone because we all go for lunch at different times) and just yapping on about weird stuff and odd stories. She also keeps saying ‚Äúwhat would you do if‚Äù and then coming out with some absurd hypothetical. At the same time my other friends at work don‚Äôt like her because they find her weird, they‚Äôre not rude to her or anything but they just try and not talk to her if possible. It‚Äôs just very awkward right now, my best friend from work (who wasn‚Äôt invited to the birthday because she was in France at the time) has even approached me and asked why the girl‚Äôs so attached to me.",10,1741284456.0,rs_x,1,1.0,False

My new one is that the milk fridge under the espresso bar, the door came completely off, and I put in a ticket for it to have it fixed or replaced.. 3 days later a man comes in and just PUTS TAPE over the screw hole where it came off and claims he fixed it.. yeah the same day the door came off again.. bc coffee was spilt and it wasnt water proof tape.. so i put in another ticket, havent gotten any response.

And I gather that the rooms are shabby and visitors are forced to walk great distances to pool, beach, entrance, etc where they have to be strategic to score a pool chair. I mean -- I've never been, so this is just what I'm gleaning from the interwebs. Hopefully we'll arrive and be pleasantly surprised. (tell me I'm wrong!)

That said, I did rent a car. Mainly I thought I'd go crazy if I was locked into a resort where all the food was overpriced, knowing that amazing tacos were just over the wall for, like, under $1. 

So, my question is -- pros and pitfalls of having a rental car at The Grand Rivera Maya? What was your experience? I booked a car 7 nights for $49. I hear insurance is $25 per day for basic, and another 100 pesos a day for parking. Anything else? If you rented a car, did you find it was worth it? Did you regret it? Did you use it to go to great restaurants fun day excursions? I've read it takes a long time to retriever your car when you need it. True or false?

Also -- sorry to sound so negative to any fans of this resort. Again, just going by what I've read. 

Thank you!

My wife surprised me with the best birthday present: I‚Äôll get to go to Belgrade with 12 of my best friends for a long weekend. Belgrade was on my bucket list for a while! Also, it‚Äôs important to note that we‚Äôre hungarians. But not football ultras, just regular laid back guys in their 40s.

What we like to do:

- Sightseeing, famous landmarks in the city
- Eating local food (the best ones where the locals eat, doesn‚Äôt have to be fancy, but we‚Äôd like to sit down)
- Bars where locals go, and laid back (we don‚Äôt want to get involved in barfights)
- Clubbing (we like minimal house and techno music, the more underground and cozy the better, we don‚Äôt like white couches, fake palm trees and flashy cocktails, the best if it‚Äôs dark and the ground is sticky lol).
- Neighborhoods to hang out (walking/sitting on a bench/on the grass/grabbing a coffee in a genuinely nice place)
- Cool museums (anything that is out of the ordinary, I think we‚Äôs skip art for now)

Also, any good advice, dos and don‚Äôt dos is greatly appreciated!

1j51jmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1j51jmb/sf_sci_fi_down_in_the_air/,[SF] Sci Fi - Down in the Air,"Julianne stood in the Delta Platinum-Plus business class line of Gate D8 in Charlotte‚Äôs airport, ready to board her flight.

Slightly sweaty in her fleece zip up, she bored herself with scrolling through her WeatherStream‚Ñ¢ app. She'd started paying for the premium version last year so she could see what she was seeing now: clear December skies over her route. Behind her, a couple whispered something - ""doubled in three years"" - with LA accents still fresh on their tongues.

Her firm, Mitchell & Greer, represented Atlantic Capital Partners, a boutique investment bank financing the Western Horizons drilling project. The partners expected her to help close this deal quickly. Oil claims weren't going to negotiate themselves, and the residents near North Dakota's Badlands needed to understand that resistance was futile. Julianne had once visited the Badlands on a family vacation during law school.

She still had the photograph of herself against the striated rock formations on her desk at home, tucked behind her son‚Äôs school pictures. Next to them stood a small crystal award that Tom had received six months before his entire department was replaced by what the company called their ""Domestic Intelligence Initiative.""

Some mornings, before leaving for work, she'd look at those mementos and feel something tighten in her chest. Then she'd kiss her family goodbye and head out to make the mortgage payment on their Meyers Park house - a house they managed to secure just before prices pushed even senior associates into the fringes of America‚Äôs fastest-growing metro area.

A few feet away, the economy passengers were lining up in their designated area. They looked tired, resigned to try and enjoy the new ‚ÄúEfficiency Seating‚Äù Delta had implemented last fall. At least there were still actual seats for pregnant women and the elderly (for now). A middle-aged man tried slipping into the Platinum-Plus line, making a show of rubbing his back.

""Sir,"" said the gate agent with practiced patience, ""Effiency Seating passengers need to remain in their designated boarding zone.""

""My back's killing me,"" the man insisted. ""I served this country. You really gonna make me stand for two hours?""

""You can purchase an open seat on the plane - one is available,"" the agent replied, not looking up from her tablet.

""Pff, no thanks"" he snapped back, shuffling back to his original line. ‚ÄúFucking bullshit,‚Äù he muttered.

Did you know I write way more than this usually? And that it‚Äôs (usually) nonfiction analysis of the world you and I are living in?

Two businessmen beside Julianne were discussing something in low voices. She caught fragments despite trying to focus on her email.

""Did you hear about that collision at Minneapolis last month?""

""Seventeen casualties. Would've been worse if not for that one PARETO controller.""

""Heh. PARETO. Who the hell comes up with this shit? Just call ‚Äòem what they are: prisoners. Just some damn woke nonsense.""

""Ha, yeah. Shit you hear they're working twelve-hour shifts, too?""

They both shook their heads, then immediately switched back to discussing whatever they were talking about.

Julianne clocked out and checked her Delta app. Her bank had splurged for an upgrade to seated business class. Good thing, too; image mattered to small-town folk and she didn‚Äôt want to be tired when potentially dodging fists after them how much they were going to get paid for their land.

The boarding announcement chimed, and Julianne gathered her carry-on.

As she moved toward the gate, she caught a glimpse of the standing passengers arranging themselves into their assigned rows, checking the small placards that showed where to place their feet, where to grip the overhead rails. They all looked as though they were paratroopers, ready to disembark the jet at any moment.

Julianne settled into her seat, sliding her carry-on beneath. The business cabin hummed with beeps of seatbelt systems and the rustle of blankets being unwrapped.

A flight attendant appeared in the aisle. She held the oxygen mask while tapping commands into her wrist console.

""Welcome aboard Delta flight 2748 to Bismarck. I'll be demonstrating our updated safety protocols."" Holographic projections activated. ""Our oxygen deployment now includes enhanced response technology for your protection and comfort.""

The flight attendant continued, ""In the event of unexpected flight path adjustments, please assume this position."" The hologram showed a passenger tucking their head between their knees. ""This position ensures optimal passenger stability.""

The man beside Julianne checked something on his tablet, frowning at the screen. He had salt-and-pepper hair and a weather-beaten face. He smelled, slightly; perhaps he was farting. His badge, partially visible under his jacket, showed a Delta logo and the words ""Atmospheric Systems.""

Julianne crinkled her nose, opened her brief, and began highlighting sections for tomorrow's meeting.

""Looks important,"" the man said, adjusting himself in his seat and glancing at her documents before returning to his tablet. ""Going to Bismarck for business?""

""Yes."" She turned the folder away from him.

""Oh, my apologies, ma‚Äôam, I don‚Äôt mean to intrude,‚Äù he replied, genuinely seeming sorry.

‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù she replied dryly.

A pause hung between them. She reopened her folder. He reopened the conversation much to her silent dismay.

‚ÄúJust get a little antsy is all,‚Äù He said to the back of the seat in front of him.

‚ÄúMmm.‚Äù She replied, not meeting his eyes.

The PA system crackled.

""This is your captain. We're experiencing some forecast reconciliation today, but we've selected an optimized routing for your comfort. We appreciate your patience as we navigate today's atmospheric conditions.""

The man glanced at his tablet again and tisked his tongue. ""Route changes. Again.""

""What?"" Julianne asked.

""Said 'route changes'. Damn annoying, and damn common."" He replied quickly.

""They are?"" Julianne asked, surprised.

""Oh yeah. Well, only when different systems disagree."" He tucked his tablet away. ""So, about every day for the past five years.""

""You must fly often,"" she replied.

""Oh yeah, Delta needed folks like me after NOAA went away, so I stay up in the air."" He said, grinning slightly. ""Name's Dale, by the way.‚Äù He extended a hand that appeared somehow both greasy and ashy.

Julianne took it as coureosuy. ‚ÄúJulianne.‚Äù She replied.

‚ÄúNice to meet you Miss Julianne.‚Äù He said with a smile.

She went back to reading before her curiosity needled her into asking.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòneeded people like you‚Äô?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Dale started. ‚ÄúI mean just that we‚Äôre kind of like a sort of safety theater now. Makes passengers feel better seeing 'Former Government Meteorologist' on the brochure.""

In the Efficiency Seating area, Julianne saw attendants distributing harnesses with additional straps that people could attach to the poles that crawled on the cabin ceiling above them.

Dale lowered his voice and leaned over. ""Company secret: it's a good thing you're flying today, Miss Julianne.""

""What? Why?"" Julianne shot back.

He quickly answered. ""Tower schedules the white-collar PARETO guys on Tuesdays.""

""They put white-collar criminals in PARETO too?"" Julianne asked, surprised.

""Oh yeah. Insider traders, tax folks. The ones who can do math."" He tapped his temple. ""Slower days get the DUIs and possession charges, ya know. Half couldn't pass algebra yet they're landing planes."" He laughed to himself and checked over his shoulder. A second passed before he asked her ""Hey, you check your weather app lately?""

""Not since boarding.""

""Makes sense. Just more time spent worrying or reading shit you‚Äôre not going to remember anyway."" He pulled a small bottle from his pocket. ""Mind if I...?‚Äù She waved her hand at him in envious approval. ‚ÄúHelps with the flight."" he said as he hunchbacked in his seat and guzzled it in one go.

The captain's voice returned. ""We've been cleared for an on-time departure. Forecasts are showing a smooth flight to Bismarck today.""

The man cocked his head at those words, a wry smile resting on his face. Outside the window, a worker sprayed something on the wing. The canister label wasn't visible from her seat.

Her weather app pinged with an upgrade notification. She declined.

Soon, the engines roared as the plane accelerated down the runway. Julianne glanced out the window, watching the terminal buildings blur past. Behind her, in Efficiency Seating, she heard the telltale sounds of adjustment: the soft clinking of harnesses tightening, a few surprised grunts as the plane lifted and bodies swayed forward against their restraints.

The plane banked sharply as they glided towards cruising altitude. Through the small gap between seats, Julianne caught glimpses of standing passengers gripping their poles, knuckles white, bodies tilted at uncomfortable angles. An attendant moved among them, making minor harness adjustments.

Forty minutes into the flight, Julianne had settled into her routine. She'd reviewed the settlement projections twice, marked potential problem parcels on her tablet map, and made notes on which residents might require ""personalized incentives."" Her company document template used three levels of persuasion: Green (standard offer), Yellow (enhanced compensation with confidentiality clause), and Red (mention of government interest or eminent domain).

Most of her assignments were pre-marked Red.

Julianne's phone buzzed. A notification: ""Video message from: Tom."" She glanced at her seatmate. Dale had already dozed off, mouth slightly open, gripping his empty mini bottle.

She tapped the video. Her six-year-old appeared, eyes wide, holding up a science project - some kind of diorama with three moons orbiting a misshapen planet.

""Look what me and Dad made!"" Her son's gap-toothed smile filled the screen

The camera panned slightly, revealing their kitchen. Tom had converted half the granite island into a makeshift workspace covered with craft supplies. His keyboards were stacked on a shelf nearby, dusty museum pieces now. A ""DevOps"" coffee mug held paintbrushes instead of pens.

Tom's voice from off-camera: ""Show momma how it spins.""

Ethan turned a makeshift crank. The moons wobbled around the planet as he giggled. The camera shifted again, catching Tom's reflection in the window; he was still wearing the Stanford Computer Science t-shirt she'd bought him years ago when he graduated from his masters program, now faded from countless washes.

""Dad made this part with his special tools,"" Ethan said, pointing to a tiny mechanical gear system. ""It's super cool! He says it's en-gin-eering."" He pronounced each syllable carefully, clearly repeating a word he'd heard many times.

""That's right, bud,"" Tom's voice came from off-camera. ""And don't forget to show momma what you made.""

""I painted ALL the moons myself!"" Ethan said proudly.

The kitchen calendar was visible behind him, with ""PROPERTY TAX DUE"" circled in red and ""CALL ABOUT REFINANCE"" written on the following Tuesday. A real estate flyer was magneted to the refrigerator.

Julianne's thumb hovered over the screen. She smiled big and typed a response to her husband. ‚ÄúTell Ethan I said ‚ÄòThat's amazing buddy! You're getting so good at staying in the lines!‚Äô And give him a big hug from his momma.‚Äù

Then a separate message just for Tom: ""Thanks for helping him. Your skills are being put to good use! ‚ù§Ô∏è Just checked - transfer should go through today. If not, I‚Äôll just figure out some way to sue the bank lol üòò.‚Äù

The cabin lights flickered. Her signal bar disappeared. The spinning moons froze mid-orbit. The send button grayed out.

She tried refreshing. Nothing. She toggled airplane mode on and off. Still nothing. Both messages left unsent.

""Ladies and gentlemen, we're experiencing some minor connectivity adjustments,"" the pilot announced. ""Premium WiFi and messaging should resume momentarily.""

Julianne closed the message window, set a reminder to ""send video response"" for later, and switched to her work folder. Her thumb swiped through document tabs: ""N. Dakota/Parcel Analysis,"" ""Resident Profiles,"" ""Comparable Settlements,"" and finally the one labeled ""My Babies <3"" and stuck the video in the last one.

She opened her briefing documents. The first slide showed a map of parcels outlined in red with dollar amounts: $2,020 per acre, highlighted in yellow as ""exceeding fair market value by 14%.""

She practiced under her breath: ""The offer represents a unique opportunity to receive immediate value for land that, frankly, has limited development potential otherwise.""

Too casual. She tried again.

""This compensation package reflects the company's commitment to community partnership while respecting property rights.""

Better, but still missing something. She added:

""Of course, if we can't reach an agreement, there are other options available to the project. But I'm confident we won't need to explore those.""

Dale stirred beside her. She closed the folder and tried refreshing her email again, watching the loading circle spin endlessly.

The flight attendant passed by and Julianne called out to her.

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù she said quietly.

The attendant met her eye.

‚ÄúDo you know when the wi-fi will be back?‚Äù Julianne asked. The flight attendant smiled softly and pulled out a tablet.

""It looks like we‚Äôre expecting the onboard diagnostics and troubleshooting processes to complete within the next half hour, so it could be as soon as then. Would you like a refreshment while we wait?""

Julianne briefly glanced at her frozen message one more time, then closed it while nodding. She said her drink order - vodka diet coke - and thanked the attendant.

The flight attendant returned with a clear plastic cup. Ice cubes clinked against the sides as she set it on Julianne's tray table. The dark liquid sloshed over the rim, spattering tiny droplets onto Julianne's sleeve.

""I'm so sorry,"" the attendant said, quickly offering a napkin. Her hand trembled visibly as she dabbed at the spill.

Julianne noticed how the woman's fingers jerked slightly as she tried to steady them. The attendant's name tag read ""MELISSA"" with a small silver star next to it.

""You okay?"" Julianne asked, her voice lowered.

The attendant straightened, composing herself. ""Oh, just missed my medicine today."" Her professional smile returned instantly. ""Nothing to worry about.""

Behind her, a tone chimed from the galley. She glanced back. ""Excuse me.""

Julianne watched the attendant retreating to the back of the plane. Julianne‚Äôs own acid reflux medication had been ""temporarily unavailable"" at a few different pharmacies last month. The only place that had it wanted triple the usual co-pay. Some things you just learned to work around.

She took a sip of her drink - a bit watery but the vodka still burned pleasantly. Dale was still asleep beside her, his head tilted at an uncomfortable angle. In Efficiency Seating, passengers shifted their weight from one foot to the other, the overhead harnesses creaking slightly with each movement.

Julianne unfolded her napkin methodically, spreading it across her lap. She reached for her tablet again. Plot 34B belonged to a family that had farmed the land for three generations. The compensation calculator had flagged them for the enhanced package, as they had an elderly resident who needed specialized care.

She made a note: ""Mention healthcare benefits package?"" It might be useful leverage.

Her drink wobbled as the plane bobbed in the air momentarily. Melissa the flight attendant passed through the cabin again, one hand gripping seat backs for support. Julianne caught her eye briefly. The woman gave a small, almost imperceptible nod before continuing her rounds. She looked pale under the cabin lights.

Two rows ahead, another passenger gestured for service. Melissa's smile leaned down to assist as she braced herself against the seat.

Julianne returned to her screen, swiping to the next parcel profile. The drink sat half-finished on her tray, the napkin beneath it perfectly aligned with the edges of the tray table.

Then the plane dropped.

Not a gentle sink. It felt like freefall. Julianne's stomach lifted through her throat. Her drink jumped up and down in its cup.

Metal screamed against physics as the fuselage twisted and window shades snapped up or down on their own. Overhead bins popped open, shelling bags and coats like artillery rounds into the legs and shoulders of standers and sitters alike.

""Jesus Christ!"" Her seatmate hissed beside her.

The aircraft bucked upward and Julianne slammed back into her seat. Her tablet hit the ceiling, cracked, then crashed down onto someone three rows ahead. A chorus of terror filled the cabin as the plane rolled sideways, banking at an angle like a man rolling his neck.

Panels in the ceiling split open. Some oxygen masks dropped, dangling from yellow plastic tubes like bizarre fruit. Other compartments remained stubbornly shut.

The plane shuddered. Deep vibrations rattled Julianne's teeth and bones. Through the gap between seats, she saw standing passengers collapsing into each other, their harnesses straining against the clips. An elderly man's tether snapped; younger passengers braced him against the pole.

""Oh my GOD"" someone prayed and yelled from rows back.

Then, as suddenly as it began, the plane leveled. The shuddering subsided to a gentle vibration, then smoothed out entirely. For thirty seconds, no one moved. No one spoke.

Then, a nervous laugh from somewhere. A cough. The shuffling of people reclaiming dignity along with belongings.

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" the captain's voice finally arrived, steady and unremarkable, ""we experienced some unscheduled directional adjustments due to a pocket vortex. All systems are nominal, and we'll be arriving at our destination on schedule. Flight attendants will be coming through the cabin shortly.""

People retrieved thing. Straightened clothing. Beside her, her seatmate used a napkin to dab coffee from his sleeve. His face had aged ten years in two minutes, but his voice was composed.

""Not the worst I‚Äôve experienced,"" he said, as if commenting on rain.

In economy, passengers helped each other back into position. Harnesses were reattached, twisted straps untangled. A woman with a bloody nose pressed a tissue to her face while scrolling through her phone with her free hand.

Melissa the attendant appeared in the aisle, somehow looking fresh despite a tear in her uniform sleeve.

""We'd like to offer our premium passengers a complimentary beverage service for the inconvenience,"" she announced, her smile back in place. Julianne noticed her hand still trembled, the only evidence that anything had happened at all.

Oxygen masks still hung from the ceiling, ignored now like holiday decorations left up too long. No one moved to put them away.

""I'll take a double scotch,"" Her seatmate told the attendant. ""Neat.""

Two rows ahead, the businessmen from the terminal were already back to gabbing.

She pulled out her phone and began composing a new message to Tom. She got as far as ""I love"" before deleting it, too nervous to finish.

""Fuck, I ‚Ä¶ need to use the restroom,"" Julianne said. Dale stood awkwardly to let her pass.

She made her way down the aisle and mentally began checking off the boxes in her head: finish brief, review the municipal contingency options, call Tom and Ethan as soon as she landed.

The bathroom was narrow but clean. Julianne locked the door and went through her routine.

Julianne reached into her bag and found her compact mirror. Her face looked exactly the same. She half-expected to see someone changed, marked, different. But her features were arranged precisely as they had been before the plane tried to tear itself apart.

As she washed her hands, she noticed something on the edge of the sink - a black lanyard with an ID badge. She picked it up.

""AeroTech Solutions"" the card read, with a photo of a balding man with a mustache. Below the company logo was an access designation: ""Terminal C-ALL"" with a barcode. Flipping it over revealed nothing else of note.

Julianne dried her hands and slipped the lanyard into her pocket and went back to her seat.

Dale had reclined in his chair slightly when she returned, flipping through the in-flight magazine.

""God who reads this shit,"" he muttered. ‚ÄúOh, right, me.‚Äù He laughed to himself before noticing her.

Julianne sat down and pulled out the lanyard. She said nothing, only raised her eyebrows to him, treating it like a secret.

Dale glanced over and snorted. ""Jesus. Makes sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does?‚Äù She asked quietly.

He took it from her and examined it. ‚ÄúAreoTech are the guys who the airlines hire to do maintenance checks occasionally. Delta contracted out three years ago. Terminal C-ALL, huh? Now that‚Äôs pretty funny.""

""What's funny about it?"" Julianne asked.

Dale handed it back. ""It means this guy can access any secure area in Terminal C. Maintenance, fuel lines, navigation systems, everything."" He chuckled. ""And he left it in the bathroom of a plane. Classic.""

""Shouldn't we give it to someone?"" Julianne asked.

""Why bother?‚Äù Dale shrugged. ‚ÄúBy the time we land, his supervisor will have already printed him a new one. No questions asked. Fuck, I mean, I heard that last month AeroTech found one of their guys sleeping in the wheel well of a 737. They just moved him to baggage handling.""

Julianne looked at the badge again, then slipped it into the seat pocket in front of her. She then reached into her purse for her travel-sized hand sanitizer. The bathroom sink had looked clean, but you never knew. Old habits. She pumped a dollop onto her palm and rubbed her hands together, the sharp sanitary smell momentarily centering her.

Her tablet pinged. WiFi connectivity had been restored. Her inbox refreshed with a new batch of emails, including one from her firm's managing partner. The subject line read: ""Badlands Package ‚Äì Updated Parameters.""

She opened it to find revised compensation figures. The numbers had been reduced by 8% across all parcels. A note at the bottom read: ""Adjustments necessary to maintain project viability. Present as final offer.""

She practiced the new pitch under her breath, replacing ""exceeding fair market value"" with ""reflecting current market conditions.""

About thirty minutes later, the captain's voice crackled over the intercom. ""Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning our final descent into Bismarck. Current ground temperature is 28 degrees Fahrenheit. PARETO ground crews have completed runway deicing procedures - so make sure to thank one if you see one in the terminal. We should be on the ground in approximately fifteen minutes.""

Dale's eyes flickered as he checked his phone. ""Ahead of schedule,"" he muttered. ""Wow.‚Äù

Almost imperceptably, the intercom made a static noise, then: ""-confirm runway six is clear for-"" followed by garbled voices. ""- on deicing, we ‚Ä¶another-"" The transmission cut off abruptly.

""Just some tower cross-talk,"" the flight attendant announced, moving through the cabin collecting trash. ""Nothing to be concerned about.""

Julianne peered out the window as the plane descended through cloud cover. North Dakota stretched below, flat and white with patches of brown. Snow-covered fields extended to the horizon, broken only by the occasional road or cluster of buildings. In the distance, the Missouri River snaked across the landscape like a dark ribbon.

Seat backs forward. Tray tables up. The familiar ritual of landing, everyone following instructions with automatic precision. In Effiency Seating, passengers tightened their standing harnesses, preparing for the jolt of touchdown.

Her seatmate leaned back in his seat. ""Hate this part,"" he said loud enough for her to hear.

The plane dipped further down. Bismarck came into view‚Äîthe airport, the city beyond. Everything looked small, toy-like.

Julianne glimpsed the runway as they approached, a gray strip cutting through the white landscape. Something about it didn't look right. Not completely clear. Patches of white still visible, reflecting the afternoon sun.

""Final approach,"" announced the captain. ""Cabin crew, prepare for landing.""

Julianne looked at her text chain with Tom. She quickly typed ""Love you guys"" and pressed send.

The runway approached. Closer. Closer. The landing gear deployed with a mechanical groan.

The wheels touched down with a squeal of rubber on pavement. Normal. Expected.

Then, all wrong. The plane wouldn‚Äôt slow.

""Ice,"" Her seatmate nearly yelled, eyes wide now.

The massive jet drifted across the ice like a hockey puck. The right landing gear struck something‚Äîa light, a marker, something solid enough. The wheel assembly tore away with a clang and rip, followed by the collective intake of breath of two hundred people.

Julianne's vision tunneled. She grabbed for the mask swinging in front of her facel.

Nothing came through the mask. She yanked it closer, pinched the sides, and reflexively bent over, head between her knees. She breathed with such panic she began to scream. Still nothing.

The wing dipped and caught the ground. Julianne's world tilted.

In the slow-time of disaster, she registered fragments: The standing passengers folding like lawn chairs. A flight attendant's cry cut short. The ground rushing up to meet the windows on her side of the plane.

Impact.

For one moment, silence. Just the soft tick of cooling metal and the distant sound of the still-spinning left engine.

Then. the window beside her bowed inward and shattered, spraying her with glass.

Julianne's mind emptied of negotiations, property values, and pitch angles. Only Tom and Ethan remained, their faces bright in her mind's eye. They would not know her last thoughts were of them.

Finally, the smells of jet fuel, burning hair, and the acrid tang of panic and frost and blood as flames erupted from somewhere behind her.

1j51cks,https://i.redd.it/03rjxhs8x3ne1.jpeg,SFW (Safe for Work) alphabet challenge Empress of mankind (Warning: wholesomeness),"Note: I can finally say I'm done with the Empress. I might do a remake of the NSFW version of the alphabet to refine it even more, but Yeah, I say it looks good and Next time I will do the top three Primarchs that wins the Poll and The Empress real name is Nirvana by the way and enjoy

A = Affection (How affectionate are they? How do they show affection?): 
The Empress is confident and articulate, and every verbal expression of affection she offers carries immense weight. Whether it‚Äôs a heartfelt confession or a casual, loving remark, her words are always deliberate and sincere. She isn‚Äôt one to hold back, using her voice to convey the depth of her feelings with unwavering conviction. For her, words carry ‚Äúpower‚Äù, and speaking her love is not just an act of affection but a declaration of devotion leaving no doubt about how much he means to her. When she tells someone she loves them, it isn‚Äôt just a passing sentiment; it is a vow, a promise, a truth that she will uphold forever. Her tone changes depending on the moment sometimes it‚Äôs soft and tender, whispered like a secret meant only for him. Other times, it‚Äôs firm and resolute, an unshakable statement of fact. She knows the weight of her words, and when she speaks love, she means it with her entire being. 

B = Best friend (What would they be like as a best friend? How would the friendship start?): 
Nirvana would be the kind of best friend who is always there, no matter what. She offers unwavering support, endless patience, and a warmth that never fades, even through centuries of change. She listens without judgment, gives advice when needed, and knows exactly when to just sit in comfortable silence. She would be the type to remember every little thing that makes her best friend smile, from their favorite flowers to the stories they love most. Their friendship started in the 8th century BC, a time when the world was still forging empires and legends. They met as children, drawn together by fate or something even stronger. While others may have seen her as an enigmatic figure, to her best friend, she was simply Nirvana a girl who laughed, dreamed, and saw beauty in everything. She was idealistic, believing in the potential for goodness even in the darkest times, always hoping for a better future. Their bond grew through shared experiences, hardships, and joys. They protected each other in times of war, debated philosophy under starlit skies, and built a connection that time itself could not erode.  Their bond grew through shared experiences, hardships, and joys. Even as centuries passed, their friendship endured. No matter how much the world changed, she would always recognize them, always be there, always call them her dearest friend.

C = Cuddles (Do they like to cuddle? How would they cuddle?): 
Nirvana loves to cuddle she‚Äôs incredibly warm and soft, making every embrace feel like pure comfort. She naturally clings to her partner like a koala, wrapping her arms and legs around them, refusing to let go. When she‚Äôs sleepy, she nuzzles into their chest or the crook of their neck, instinctively pulling them closer if they move away. If she‚Äôs feeling affectionate, she intertwines her legs with theirs, tracing soft patterns on their skin while resting her forehead against them. Regardless of the mood, Nirvana always craves physical closeness and will take any excuse to cuddle.

D = Domestic (Do they want to settle down? How are they at cooking and cleaning?): 
In the beginning, Nirvana was filled with hope an idealist who truly believed in humanity‚Äôs potential. She dreamed of a future where war and suffering would be things of the past, where she could guide mankind toward a golden age. But as time passed and she bore witness to endless cruelty, betrayal, and war, her optimism faded. She became disillusioned, realizing that humanity could not save itself. The dream of a peaceful life, of settling down, became just that.... a dream.   Yet, in the rare moments she allows herself to be human, she enjoys baking. It reminds her of a simpler time, her childhood, when her mother used to bake bread and patiently taught her the craft. The smell of fresh bread, the warmth of the oven it is one of the few things that brings her comfort, a small reminder of the world she once believed in. When she bakes, she is not the Empress of Mankind; she is simply Nirvana.   She cares for the Primarchs slightly more than she lets on, though she knows that even they are merely pieces in a much greater game. She does not often express her affection, but sometimes, when they least expect it, they will find fresh bread waiting for them never spoken of, never acknowledged, but always there.   As for cooking beyond baking, she is competent but not exceptional, approaching it with the same precision she does everything else. Cleaning is much the same a task done out of necessity rather than enjoyment. That being said, her Eternal Beloved/Consort is an absolute clean and orderly freak. He demands perfection to such an extreme that even a single speck of dust on a coffee table is unacceptable. She finds this both amusing and endearing, often teasing him about his relentless obsession with cleanliness. She has even ""accidentally"" left books slightly misaligned just to see how long it takes before he fixes them though he always does so immediately, grumbling under his breath.   Despite everything, if she had the opportunity to live a quiet life even for a short while, she would find immense joy in something as simple as making tea for a loved one, tending to a garden, or watching the stars from a peaceful home all while occasionally laughing at her Eternal Beloved/Consort‚Äôs never-ending war against dust. Even so, there are rare moments usually in the presence of her Eternal Beloved/Consort when she allows herself to linger in these small, human acts. Not because they are necessary, but because they remind her of what could have been.

E = Ending (If they had to break up with their partner, how would they do it?): 
Nirvana would never end her relationship with her Eternal Beloved/Consort lightly it would take something truly catastrophic for her to even consider it. If she were ever forced to break up with him, it would be with immense sorrow, knowing how deeply their bond runs. She would not simply walk away; she would try everything possible to mend things first, refusing to abandon him unless absolutely necessary. If it came to an unavoidable end, she would be honest but gentle, her voice filled with sorrow and love rather than anger. She would hold his hands, look into his eyes, and explain her reasons with care, emphasizing that she still loves him but cannot stay. She would cry, knowing how much it would hurt them both, but she would not let him cling to false hope. She would whisper, her voice trembling, ""I love you. I always will. But I can't stay not like this. It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôve stopped caring, but because I care too much. Please, don‚Äôt forget that."" However, given her Eternal Beloved/Consort‚Äôs possessiveness and inability to let go, this scenario is nearly impossible. She would have to be truly torn away from him by something beyond their control, because neither of them would ever willingly leave the other. 

F = Fiance(e) (How do they feel about commitment? How quick would they want to get married?): 
Nirvana values commitment deeply when she loves, she does so with her whole heart and soul. She sees relationships as lifelong journeys built on trust, understanding, and mutual growth. While she is not in a rush to get married, she cherishes the idea of a future together with her Eternal Beloved/Consort. Her love for him is unwavering, but she also understands the weight of eternity and the complexity of their bond. She would want their relationship to develop naturally, ensuring they both grow together before taking that step. That said, she already considers him her one true love marriage would simply be a formalization of something she already feels in her heart. When the time comes, she would want their wedding to be meaningful rather than grandiose. It wouldn't be about ceremony or spectacle but about the promise they make to each other. 

G = Gentle (How gentle are they, both physically and emotionally?):
Nirvana embodies both strength and gentleness, balancing the two with effortless grace. Physically, her touch is soft and deliberate whether brushing a strand of hair from her Eternal Beloved/Consort‚Äôs face or tracing idle patterns on his skin, every movement carries quiet affection. Emotionally, she is deeply empathetic, offering comfort without judgment. Her words, though powerful, are always measured whether soothing or resolute, they carry the weight of someone who understands the depths of pain and love alike. With her Eternal Beloved/Consort, she is especially gentle, knowing that even he, for all his might, needs tenderness that only she can give. 

H = Hugs (Do they like hugs? How often do they do it? What are their hugs like?): 
Nirvana loves hugs and gives them often, whether to comfort, express affection, or simply be close. Her hugs are firm yet gentle, filled with warmth and quiet reassurance. When comforting her Eternal Beloved/Consort, she holds him steady, tracing soothing circles on his back. If she‚Äôs playful, she surprises him with sudden hugs or dramatically flops onto him. At night, she clings to him instinctively, refusing to let go even if he moves away. To her, hugs are more than just affection they are a silent promise that she will always be by his side.

I = I love you (How fast do they say the L-word?): 
When Nirvana says ""I love you,"" it‚Äôs more than just words it‚Äôs a promise, a devotion, an unbreakable bond. She doesn‚Äôt take love lightly, and for her, those three words carry the weight of eternity. When she finally says them to her Eternal Beloved/Consort, it‚Äôs not just a confession but a vow one that transcends time itself. 

J = Jealousy (How jealous do they get? What do they do when they‚Äôre jealous?): 
Nirvana doesn‚Äôt get jealous easily she trusts her Eternal Beloved/Consort completely. However, if someone oversteps boundaries or disrespects their relationship, she won‚Äôt hesitate to remind them exactly where they stand. Her jealousy is quiet but undeniable a slight narrowing of her eyes, a cool yet polite tone, an almost imperceptible shift in demeanor that makes the air feel heavier. She rarely speaks her jealousy aloud, but her presence alone is enough to send a clear message: ‚ÄúKnow your place.‚Äù If someone persists, she will make sure they regret it gracefully, of course. She doesn't need anger or threats; a well-placed word, a cutting yet serene remark, and suddenly, the offender realizes just how foolish they were to test the Empress of Mankind. 

K = Kisses (What are their kisses like? Where do they like to kiss you? Where do they like to be kissed?): 
Nirvana's kisses are soft, warm, and filled with emotion. Whether it‚Äôs a simple peck or a lingering, tender kiss, she makes sure every kiss conveys her love. She enjoys kissing on the forehead as a sign of comfort, reassurance, and devotion. She also loves to place gentle kisses on the hands, appreciating even the smallest moments of intimacy. When it comes to receiving kisses, she melts when her Eternal Beloved/Consort kisses her temple, forehead, or the back of her hand. However, the kisses that truly make her heart race are the ones he places on her collarbone or the crook of her neck something about the possessiveness behind them makes her feel cherished.

L = Little ones (How are they around children?): 
Nirvana is naturally warm and nurturing around children, treating them with kindness and patience. She understands their innocence and curiosity, always speaking to them with gentle words and an encouraging tone. When a child is scared or upset, she instinctively kneels to their level, offering soft reassurances and comforting hugs. She enjoys telling stories, her voice weaving tales of hope, courage, and wonder, leaving children enchanted by her words. She doesn‚Äôt mind answering their endless questions, always taking the time to explain things in a way they can understand. If they tug at her hand or ask her to play, she obliges with a smile, indulging their games and laughter. Despite her love for children, there is a bittersweetness to it she knows she will never truly have a ""normal"" family, nor will she ever get to experience the simple joys of raising a child without the weight of her responsibilities. Yet, in those quiet moments, when a child clings to her or falls asleep in her arms, she allows herself to dream, if only for a fleeting moment, of what could have been

M = Morning (How are mornings spent with them?): 
Mornings with Nirvana are peaceful and intimate. She wakes up slowly, clinging to her Eternal Beloved/Consort like a koala, nuzzling into his warmth. She hums softly, sometimes singing in a half-dreamy state. If he tries to leave the bed, she pulls him back, refusing to let go just yet. Once she finally gets up, she enjoys quiet moments sipping coffee or tea, tending to her garden, or simply watching the sunrise. If her Eternal Beloved/Consort is awake, she teases him about his obsession with cleanliness, sometimes deliberately leaving a book slightly misaligned just to see his reaction. Despite the weight of her responsibilities, these moments are hers shared only with the one she loves.

N = Night (How are nights spent with them?): 
Nights with Nirvana are peaceful and intimate. She naturally clings to her Eternal Beloved/Consort like a koala, her warmth a quiet reassurance. If she‚Äôs feeling playful, she‚Äôll trace idle patterns on his skin or steal kisses between whispered conversations. If she‚Äôs tired, she nuzzles into his chest or the crook of his neck, instinctively pulling him closer if he moves away. Sometimes, they wander to the inner gardens of the Imperial Palace, gazing at the stars in silence or speaking about history, philosophy, or childhood memories that resurface like echoes of another time. On other nights, they remain in their chambers, resting on their bed. One will brush the other‚Äôs hair her fingers gliding through his golden locks (or Snow White hair. Depending on how he's feeling), or his hands carefully tending to her dark strands. Even if one is simply reading, the other may sit beside them, absently combing their hair, a quiet act of affection that needs no words.

O = Open (When would she start revealing things about herself?): 
Nirvana is an enigmatic figure, revealing little about herself even to her closest companions. Her true nature and intentions remain shrouded in mystery, and she shares information only when necessary. This secrecy stems from the necessity of protecting valuable truths. Once more open and trusting, she has become hardened by centuries of war, betrayal, and disappointment. While she still offers kindness and inspires hope, the deepest parts of her soul remain hidden. She carries her suffering in silence, allowing only rare glimpses of vulnerability with those she trusts. Malcador, her oldest confidant, knows truths few do. Ra Endymion and Kitten have earned her trust, and Constantin Valdor sees her as the weary soul behind her imperial role. To them, she is not merely the Empress of Mankind; and with them, she does not have to bear her burdens alone. Her affection is often unspoken but expressed through small, meaningful acts. The Primarchs may not hear her say she cares, but they‚Äôll find fresh baked goods waiting for them, a quiet gesture of her love. Those dear to her may not hear her share her pain, yet they will always feel her unwavering presence watching over them.

P = Patience (How easily angered is she?): 
Nirvana possesses immense patience, cultivated over millennia. She is a guiding hand, steadfast and unyielding, enduring hardships without complaint. She does not anger easily, understanding that mortals are flawed, and mistakes are inevitable. Even when faced with failure, she does not react with fury but with quiet disappointment something far more painful than wrath. Her patience is vast but not limitless. Expecting excellence from herself and those around her, she tolerates genuine effort but reacts to betrayal, incompetence, or cruelty with a cold, terrifying wrath. Those who break her trust encounter a silence far more damning than loud fury. When pushed to her limit, her anger is swift and merciless, yet always controlled. She does not rage; she acts with the weight of inevitability. Still, she clings to hope that humanity can rise above its flaws and that the dream she once believed in is not entirely lost. This, perhaps, is her greatest patience of all: the willingness to believe in a future she may never see.

Q = Quizzes (How much would they remember about you? Do they remember every little detail you mention in passing, or do they kind of forget everything?): 
Nirvana remembers everything about her Eternal Beloved/Consort Every little detail him mention, even in passing, is stored in her mind. She remembers your favorite foods, the way you like your tea or coffee, the stories you tell her, and even the exact words you used to describe something years ago. If you casually mention liking a specific flower, you might find it in her garden later. If you have a favorite song, she might hum it softly when you're feeling down. She doesn‚Äôt just listen she cherishes everything about them, making sure you always feel seen and understood. 

R = Remember (What is their favorite moment in your relationship?):
Nirvana treasures two moments above all. The first was when her Eternal Beloved/Consorther Eternal Beloved/Consort so often cold, reserved, and distant smiled and laughed for the first time when they were children. It was fleeting, but in that instant, she saw the boy behind the immortal, the humanity beneath the godlike presence. It was a moment that remained in her heart forever. The second was the day he proposed to her a grand event, attended by every Perpetual, held in a secret century that only they knew. He had meticulously prepared a speech, determined to make it perfect, yet when the moment arrived, his confidence wavered. For the first time, he looked truly flustered, shy, and utterly lost for words. Nirvana, unable to watch him struggle, took his hand, smiled, and spoke first pouring her heart out while he stood there, caught between embarrassment and adoration. It was one of the happiest days of her life.

S = Security (How protective are they? How would they protect you? How would they like to be protected?): 
Nirvana is fiercely protective of her Eternal Beloved/Consort, not out of possessiveness but because they are the most precious soul to her. She would defy fate itself to keep them safe, viewing their protection as an act of love rather than a duty. To safeguard them, she has assigned an entire Custodian Guard, a handpicked group of at least 20 of the most elite warriors in the Imperium. At all times, they are accompanied by this formidable force, their presence a silent yet unyielding testament to how much Nirvana treasures them. However, among this elite cadre, one stands above the rest their personal Custodian bodyguard and captain of the guard, who never leaves their side. Unlike most Custodians, who are rigid and unyielding in their devotion to the Emperor, this personal Custodian bodyguard is different handpicked not just for their martial prowess but also for their ability to hold a genuine conversation. While still unwaveringly loyal to Nirvana, they are also her Eternal Beloved/Consort‚Äôs closest companion and best friend, someone they can trust, confide in, and rely on beyond mere duty. Nirvana herself is their greatest protector. If any threat arises, she would bring ruin upon the cosmos to keep them safe. Beyond battle, she ensures they feel cherished and secure in a demanding universe. Though she does not seek protection for herself, the one thing she longs for is their presence. She treasures the quiet moments when they simply stand by her side, reminding her that she is not alone. More than armies, more than Custodians, it is their unwavering love and support that shields her heart, making even the darkest nights feel bright.

T = Try (How much effort would they put into dates, anniversaries, gifts, everyday tasks?): 
Nirvana puts immense effort into everything she shares with her Eternal Beloved/Consort from thoughtful gifts to legendary anniversaries. Every time she returns to the Imperial Palace, she brings back a gift, always something meaningful: ""This flower blooms once every thousand years. It reminded me of you."" Over time, he's gathered a vast collection, each piece proof that he is always in her heart. The Palace is filled with artwork depicting him, crafted by renowned artists, the Custodes, and even Nirvana herself. And in every single one, He is always depicted smiling or laughing. To others, he is eternal, unshaken, and imperious, but to her, he is so much more. That smile the one he shows only to her is what she cherishes most. Each piece is a reminder of those rare, precious moments when he allows himself to be at peace, when the weight of eternity fades, and she alone remains. Their anniversaries have become legendary competitions, escalating from grand gestures to utter absurdity. One year, she commissioned an entire opera chronicling their love story, performed by the greatest singers in the Imperium. In response, he had a secluded world terraformed into a paradise, filled with extinct flowers from her private garden. Another time, she rewrote a forgotten language into poetry, while he ensured the passage of an ancient star across the heavens so that its dying light would shimmer in her favorite color on the day of their celebration. On a more personal level, she once spent an entire year crafting a book, each page filled with moments they shared over millennia only for him to respond with a sculpture of them dancing, made from the bones of long-dead worlds they once walked together. Sometimes, they invite old Perpetual friends Malcador, Ollanius Persson, Hannibal Barca, and even Mr. Chow (yes, THAT Mr. Chow from the Hangover movie) for celebrations that range from elegant to outright chaotic. Even in everyday life, she quietly cares for him, making sure he's comfortable, bringing him coffee or tea, and reminding him to rest when he forgets. To the Imperium, she is the Empress, but to him, she is simply his Nirvana his greatest love, always by his side. 

U = Ugly (What would be some bad habits of theirs?): 
Nirvana is a perfectionist to a fault, often overplanning and obsessing over making everything just right whether it‚Äôs a date, a conversation, a battle plan, or even something as simple as making coffee or tea. If things don‚Äôt go as planned, she gets visibly frustrated with herself, even if no one else thinks it‚Äôs a big deal. She also has a tendency to bottle up her own worries and struggles because she doesn‚Äôt want to burden others, always prioritizing their well-being over her own. This sometimes leads to emotional exhaustion, though she‚Äôd never admit it outright. And while she is usually warm and affectionate, if someone truly angers her, her fury is legendary but she rarely lets it show unless absolutely necessary.

V = Vanity (How concerned are they with their looks?): 
As a perfectionist to a fault, Nirvana ensures every aspect of her appearance is flawless, not out of vanity but because she believes she must always be at her best for herself, for others, and for the ideal she represents. Every detail, from her attire to the way her hair falls, is meticulously arranged. If something is even slightly off, she will fix it immediately. She doesn‚Äôt actively seek compliments, but when her Eternal Beloved/Consort praises her, she might pause, momentarily caught off guard. Though she tries to play it off with her usual grace, a faint blush might color her cheeks, and for a brief second, she looks truly flattered. If Like Kitten (or another beloved companion) showers her with affectionate words, she may laugh softly and ruffle their hair, teasing them while secretly treasuring their words. She never outright asks for validation, but deep down, she appreciates it more than she lets on. 

W = Whole (Would they feel incomplete without you?): 
Absolutely. Nirvana may be strong, independent, and self-sufficient, but without her Eternal Beloved/Consort a part of her very soul would be missing. He is not just her love he is her other half, the one who truly understands her, the one who has walked beside her through countless ages. Without him, she would carry on, for duty demands it, but the light in her eyes would dim, and the warmth of her smile would never quite reach her heart. She would still tend to her people, still fight for humanity‚Äôs future, but in the quiet moments when the stars burn bright and the universe feels vast and empty‚Äîshe would long for his presence. The absence of his touch, his voice, his unwavering devotion would leave an aching void that nothing else could fill. Even if she never spoke of it, even if she buried it beneath duty and resolve, she would never truly be whole again.

X = Xtra (A random headcanon for them.): 
Nirvana loves every single animal, whether dangerous or cute, ugly or beautiful they‚Äôre all equally adorable in her eyes. She has a special habit of to ""boop the snout"" of every animal she meets, from the fiercest predators to the tiniest critters. She sees them all as equally worthy of affection, and her playful boops reflect the deep connection she feels with every living creature. Additionally, Nirvana is incredibly literate, and well-versed in many fields of study such as history, biochemistry, genetic engineering, literature, religious studies, and more. Her thirst for knowledge is insatiable, and she often spends hours studying ancient texts or experimenting in her lab, always seeking to understand the world in its most intricate forms.

Y = Yuck (What are some things they wouldn‚Äôt like, either in general or in a partner?): 
Nirvana dislikes unnecessary cruelty in all its forms she cannot tolerate harm or suffering inflicted without purpose or reason. She has no patience for dishonesty, as she believes truth is the foundation of trust, even when it‚Äôs difficult to hear. Disrespect is another dealbreaker for her, particularly when it comes to those she loves. She values kindness and empathy above all, so anyone who shows malice, deceit, or disregard for others quickly loses her favor. Additionally, selfishness and a lack of empathy are things she cannot abide by, especially with a partner. 

Z = Zzz (What is a sleep habits of theirs?): 
Nirvana‚Äôs sleep habits are calm and peaceful. She tends to curl up in a ball, hugging her pillow or a soft blanket, as if seeking the warmth and comfort of her Eternal Beloved/Consort even when they‚Äôre not around. When she sleeps next to them, she often ends up snuggling close, subconsciously clinging to them like a koala, basking in the security of their presence. She occasionally hums a soft lullaby or whispers gentle, loving words in her sleep, making it feel like even in dreams, she‚Äôs wrapped in affection.",6,1741283301.0,PrimarchGFs,3,1.0,False

1j51bnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1j51bnw/brewing_should_be_tailored_to_what_you_like_not/,"Brewing should be tailored to what you like, not what others say","When I first got my Moka Pot, I followed the advice of boiling the water in a kettle before brewing with the Moka. Though this produced a nice cup of coffee, it was too acidic for me. So I started brewing with room temperature water, and it made coffee that I enjoyed much more. 


What I realized is that this advice comes from those who enjoy lighter roasts, and a cup with a nice acidity to it, and they're trying to adjust their brewing method to accommodate lighter beans which need a higher brewing temperature, and to emphasize the qualities they most enjoy in them. While I can appreciate light roasts and acidity, it's really not my preference. I honestly don't like acidity in my cup. I not only like the notes of dark chocolate and roasted nuts found in dark roasts, but I most enjoy the smokey notes of sweet pipe tobacco found in even darker roasts. My brewing method should be tailored to my beans, and to emphasize the qualities that I most enjoy in them.


So my preferences are at the opposite end of the spectrum from the people giving that advice, and that's okay. What we do share in common is a great love for coffee, and an insistence on freshly roasted beans, freshly ground right before brewing.


The point is: don't take someone else's brewing advice and coffee preferences as gospel. Be open to experimenting with roast level, grind size, starting water temperature, and brewing velocity. Find out what you really enjoy in coffee and try to emphasize those qualities. And don't forget that it also depends on your model of Moka Pot, whether stainless steel or aluminum, and whether you are using an induction or gas burner.",6,1741283241.0,mokapot,5,1.0,False

That‚Äôs fine for large transfers‚Äîlike moving millions of dollars‚Äîbut it‚Äôs impractical for buying a coffee or sending a friend $20.

1j51422,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1j51422/we_connected_from_dating_apps_as_friends/,We Connected From Dating Apps as Friends,"Soo - we met with different outlooks on dating at the time, and I‚Äôve felt some great vibes since then.

I (M30) matched with her (F33) on Tinder back in September ‚Äò24. We messaged for a week or so and stopped talking. A month later, we matched on Hinge and picked up where we left off.

Some context - I got out of an 8 year monogamous relationship (married 4 - split due to my ex having undiagnosed BPD and we couldn‚Äôt handle it) June ‚Äò24 and wanted to date openly/explore as I felt like my 20s flew by in an increasingly unhealthy relationship. I‚Äôve felt immense happiness leaving and am in therapy to navigate open dating *ethically.* It led me to a period of being Polycurious, dating multiple folks with the chance of intimacy/romance to sprout. Learned a lot from that (therapy, reading Polysecure and The Ethical Slut, Podcasts, Reddit, etc.) and learned I can handle open or closed dating.

Anyway, when her and I connected (let‚Äôs call her Tess) on Hinge, I stated that I am dating ENM/am polycurious. She stated she can only do monogamy. I stated I‚Äôm down for friendship too, so we connected over coffee and dug the vibe.

We exchanged Instas/TikTok that day.

We live in different towns from each other, about an hour out. I go to her town to see family once in awhile. I mentioned being down to hang again in a few weeks, and she invited me to her place as a like a bonfire hang with her sister and friends in November.

I get there and Tess had eaten some chocolate üçÑ and offered me some as well. I‚Äôm into it and join the trip. It was Tess, her sister, and another friend of Tess‚Äôs (F). Her friend was sober, her sister had a small dose of üçÑ. Anyway, it‚Äôs one of a handful of encounters where I was hanging with just girls, and I loved the energy. Got along, and Tess offered to share her blanket with me when we got inside as we watched TV (thighs were touching). 

From that night a group chat was made with Tess, her friend (let‚Äôs call her Ally), and myself. 

Over the next few months, we‚Äôd connect every few weeks to hang out as a group, whether it‚Äôs thrifting, eating somewhere, etc.. I really enjoyed the friendship and a newfound girlie friend group - it was nice to explore the more effeminate side of things as a guy that had historically been stoic/emotionally resilient. During this period from September - December, I was dating someone who was very Poly (F27, Becky). I‚Äôd tell Tess and Ally about my open dating journeys, the goals of threesomes, etc. as one does with friends.

Becky and I broke up late December and became friends, and at that point I was seeing one other person (F28, X) and periodically going on 1st/2nd dates with others from November - February. X and I deescalated to just friends on my initiative, it felt more comfortable in that dynamic ‚Äî X and I never fucked, we just made out a few times and would get stoned and watch TV together. There‚Äôs other names involved but these interactions are all single/double dates that haven‚Äôt developed to much. I also saw someone through a mutual friend in January for a month of dates and one hook up before we deescalated (F30, Y - she was monogamous/hook ups only) to friends/paused seeing each other.

Can you see why I wanted a therapist while doing all this?

Anyway, from July - January, I felt that I‚Äôve had my experiences met, to live freely and explore different relationship dynamics. It was beautiful with as many wonderful and awful emotions as one could handle, but I‚Äôm grateful for all of them, it made me feel alive compared to cycling through four stagnant emotions from my 8 year relationship. ENM let me live my life.


Back to Tess ‚Äî
Between the group hangs, there were times I‚Äôd mention going to town to work there and eat at my favorite restaurant. The first time, she invited herself, then we WFH at her place, then got our nails painted. The 2nd time, I invited her, she came, and we did the same activities. 
I was at her town last weekend and she was down to hang when I let I known. She‚Äôs invited me to a show her dad was playing and we hung for two ours last weekend. We met for coffee the next day, Sunday morning (the initial plan) and hung out there for three hours.

The previous weekend, she invited me to a flea market hang with her sister and sister‚Äôs BF. Apparently her sister freaked out/mind wandered to the obvious when she saw me buy Tess‚Äôs lunch (she spotted me on some cash only booths so I was just paying her back lol). We did another like this a few weeks prior. But in these dynamics, if I stopped to look at something, she would wander over to what I was looking at instead of continuing to stroll around. I found myself doing the same, while her sister/others would wander off in their groups.

I‚Äôm so comfortable with her. Dig her vibe. She‚Äôs fiercely independent and very Demisexual. I‚Äôve learned strong, independent woman are my type.

So here Reddit, I ask you ‚Äî so you think she likes me back or is this just a friends thing?


The last month, I‚Äôve peppered in the want to deconstruct open dating, AKA to be open to dating closed again in April. That‚Äôs when my divorce is finalized. It feels clean cut with  timeline like this. So she knows I‚Äôm going through that, am currently single, and am open to closing. She‚Äôs not strayed away from hangs with just us.

I‚Äôm hanging with her and her sister and other friends this weekend at an air bnb and bar for her sister‚Äôs birthday (her SIS invited me!).

Here‚Äôs my game plan ‚Äî in April, or May, I‚Äôm going to connect with her sister and explain these feelings with the intention of telling Tess to get a feel of things. I‚Äôll be telling Tess directly shortly after that (they live together so it‚Äôs a secret I imagine can‚Äôt be held too long).

I‚Äôm in a healthy space to say these feelings because I‚Äôm accepting and have the emotional responsibility for the three outcomes:

1) We date
2) We stay friends
3) We can‚Äôt be friends anymore

I suppose this flair would be to vent, but encouragement or a reality check of this situation is also appreciated. It‚Äôs just frustrating for me because it follows the trite ‚Äúguy friends with girl but then asks her out‚Äù trope. I genuinely value the friendship as it is should it stay that way. I‚Äôm open to more if she is too. I‚Äôd just hate to lose a friend, but I know holding these feelings in will be a breeding ground for ulterior motives, which is ultimately unhealthy.

We‚Äôll see where this goes in a few months!

I make my own coffee at home: I buy my own beans and have a grinder. I use a scale to measure the different beans exactly before I brew.

My father, who has passed away really wanted me to be an English teacher for some reason. First, I was in AB Journalism; but relapsed into a treatment center in Calabarzon (don‚Äôt judge me; I was young and wild!). 

Upon my discharge, I was forced to move to dad‚Äôs province and had a hard time because of the culture‚Äî I was born in the UAE and lived in Metro Manila prior to all this.

I was supposed to finish my degree in this province but I was in a bad state and somewhat impoverished, even. It was worse than the center! During Covid, I secretly returned to the Metro to my mom‚Äôs and later transferred to a school in Calabarzon where I didn‚Äôt fare well again‚Äî this time, because I lived alone and was far from essential stores and restaurants.

Time went by and I moved away (again) to my own place in the Metro, this time. I have been living in a little studio, regularly meet with friends, and have a steady girfriend. All is well!

But because I love shortcuts, I enrolled myself in a certain ü§î online school a year ago‚Äî so far, so good! I even am a teaching intern now!

BUT then, as I was scheduled for a virtual thesis defense, I took coffee thinking all would be fine just like the previous thesis defense I held with my (now dissolved) group. 

Lo and behold, the professors who previously were chill with me when I worked in a group berate my title, contents, and bring forth advanced teaching-related topics I don‚Äôt really understand. 

My title was approved by the adviser herself. She okayed everything. I had time to correct it, alas, because she did not guide me, I had to re-do the whole thing! 

After the defense was over, I informed my adviser I have a PWD card and she said she was offended! I told her, heart to heart, that I have been in college for almost ten years and cannot grasp these concepts because I have a diagnosed condition and am on medication, and do not plan to teach in the future‚Äî I simply wanted my professor to understand me.

New guy here, probably asking the same question you've all heard a million times, but hey, I‚Äôm on a journey, and I need some guidance. I‚Äôve recently gone down the espresso rabbit hole‚Äînot trying to be a coffee snob, just someone who wants a solid, reliable machine that makes a good cup without breaking the bank.

For years, I was that guy grabbing gas station coffee at 4 AM, thinking, ‚ÄúYep, this is fine.‚Äù Then, I ""leveled up"" to a $69 De‚ÄôLonghi with a bag of that preground yellow-label stuff everyone raves about. Thought I was living the high life‚Ä¶ until my wife scored a Breville 800ESXL for $30 at a thrift store. Game. Changer. Suddenly, my taste buds woke up, and that yellow bag hasn‚Äôt been touched since.

Now, here‚Äôs my dilemma: while the Breville is miles ahead of what I had, it doesn‚Äôt always pull the hottest shots, and since we make a lot of milk-based drinks, I‚Äôm thinking about upgrading. But wow‚Äîthose shiny, fancy machines come with some serious sticker shock.

So, the classic question: **For someone like me, who makes only one or two drinks at a time, what‚Äôs the real difference between what I have now and a $1,500-$2,000 machine?** I don‚Äôt think I want one with a built-in grinder‚ÄîI‚Äôll either stick with what I have or upgrade separately.

I want something solid, but not overkill. If I can get similar quality for less, great. If spending a bit more actually makes a big difference, I‚Äôm open to it. Also, are there any brands or models I should avoid? If that‚Äôs something best left to private messages, feel free to DM me.

What I want to share and what I am so proud of is that today I ordered my favorite Panera salad. Even with no nausea and the meds wearing off, my first instinct was to only serve myself half the salad, as the whole salad would be *too much*. 

Not six weeks ago I would have destroyed that whole salad, plus a soda and likely a dessert of some sort. Today I ate half a salad and half a baguette and I am so satisfied. 

I just feel so proud. I never thought I could ever be one of those people that ‚Äúset aside half for later.‚Äù I feel so encouraged that maybe I really can keep the weight off this time.

She procures a job at a failing coffeeshop, The Grind, which tragically burnt down 25 years ago. But Vienna has a secret, the shop previously belonged to her parents who perished in the fire, and along with them any connection Vienna had to her lineage. Two and a half decades later, the shop is now owned by Henry Kacang who despite his dream of participating in the Roast With The Most compeition, has anything but a clue on how to brew a proper cup of joe.

In Cold Brew is a satirical coffeeshop mystery that refuses to let up on the humor while french pressing the action forward at every chance. A delicious dark roast that has a lingering aroma begging for a second cup to be brewed. From start to finish, the story has its own tongue in its cheek, delivering chuckle after smirk after grin.",2,1741282184.0,KindleUnlimited,0,1.0,False

My coworkers were fantastic. Management was the most nightmarish thing on the planet. I had district managers, store managers, etc who just didn‚Äôt care about partners, customers, or the stores. The last six months I worked there as a SSV, I brought a store from having rampant black mold, slime mold in the ice bins, drains that reeked across the FOH, and other severe cleanliness issues to running as clean and as smoothly as possible with regular cleanplays scheduled at my behest. I worked with my fellow SSVs to get the store where it should be, and coached my staff members on how to respond to management in a way that was productive and constructive. I was met only with retaliation from my manager. I was scheduled on days I wasn‚Äôt available (multiple times, and told that I had to find coverage even though those days weren‚Äôt in my availability), was withheld from communications regarding changes that if I didn‚Äôt abide by that I would be written up without warning, and was taken aside and yelled at by my manager for doing my actual job. The labor practices that happen on the ground in these stores is horrible. People just assume that it‚Äôs ‚Äúmixing milk with coffee‚Äù, but when I was trained we had to memorize over 100 recipes in as little as a week before being thrown directly into the fire and expected to work just as fast as a barista who had been there for years. It is not uncommon for baristas to have full blown mental breakdowns within the first month of employment. I will not miss working there, and seeing all these terrible changes that have happened since my departure (writing on cups, overcharging for non-coffee frappes, union busting practices, etc) makes me fully not regret my decision to leave. I will continue to support my former coworkers in their unionization efforts, but I will never return to that place. It was akin to coming home to an abusive partner every day. Some days were okay, some were even pleasant, but it got to the point where I could not effectively do my job without going through mental breakdowns or facing retaliation from management for making the store better functioning and absent of black mold.",6,1741281970.0,starbucks,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôll give a few examples of each.

I used to completely dislike omegaverse as a whole but I‚Äôve grown to really enjoy the social aspects of the au, the element of trust that‚Äôs involved, real world animal biology equivalents, and the physical closeness that may not even require sex. I really like platonic omegaverse for this reason. Another one is arranged marriage fics. Used to hate it, but as I‚Äôve gotten older I have grown to like the element of people who may not like each other at first doing the work to get to know each other and learn to appreciate and grow together beyond what is expected of them and the struggles along the way.

I still mostly filter out coffee shop and modern aus normally but there‚Äôs this fic that I love/loved (it‚Äôs complete) where it follows a character in a modern powerless au as they open a coffee shop which generally I dislike but this fic stands out because it‚Äôs actually also a post-post apocalypse fic. The reason that the character opened up a coffee shop is because the world ended, but it was dealt with. And now everyone is trying to go back to normal and this coffee shop is their way of trying to bring a little slice of normalcy back to the world. 
In a similar vein I usually (like most fic readers in my experience) filter out reader insert but  I‚Äôve actually found some real gems on a few occasions. The things they all have in common are that the reader character is in a unique position that makes them see aspects of the world and characters that isn‚Äôt possible with cannon and shows assets of the world from a more outsider perspective. One example is a reader insert where you‚Äôre a service worker that the characters in the world tend to frequent that does a good job at showing the familiar world with an unfamiliar perspective. The other one is one where you‚Äôre a literal cat that the characters in the world come across and adopt which leads to these normally powerful figures struggling to deal with the hjjinks that cats get up to.

I am realizing that this was longer than anticipated but regardless I‚Äôd love to hear about some of your experiences with either growing to appreciate a tag/trope or finding fics with a tag you usually don‚Äôt like that you found yourself liking anyways.

The breakup was complicated and prolonged, but one thing we agreed on was that we would allow each other to maintain relationships and communication with the other's family (given that the family members wanted that.)  

I maintained my relationship with his sister and her two sons (16 and 20) and we meet up for coffee or lunch once in a while but see each other regularly as we are in the same neighbourhood. Her younger son has always been eager to ""get out into the world"" and a summer job opportunity came up at my work. I sent both mother and son the application and told them if they had any questions to reach out to me. It's a great job for a kid. The pay is $22/hour working 25 hours a week helping to organize a youth council for municipal government. The role entails organizing tree planting ""parties,"" creek and park cleanups, collaborating with seniors groups on community events and writing reports twice a month about what discussions are taking place at the youth council. He has already volunteered with my office a few times and my boss thinks he's a great kid, so his chances of snagging the job are pretty good.

Yes, this is blatant nepotism, but this kid is so bright, so intelligent and so charismatic. He would also have to make it through the HR interview process so it is not a guarantee he would get the job. But he works very hard in school and has confided in me several times that he doesn't want to be like the rest of his family. They all went a bit crazy during COVID, refused to get vaccinated, and slowly became anti-government... but all rely on government support to make ends meet, except my ex who is now a ""professional sports better."" So I figure if I can give this kid an opportunity to see how the real world works, he can break the cycle of entitlement and poor work ethic he was born into. 

So a few days ago I followed up with the teenager to ask how the application process was going and he told me that he hadn't begun. The deadline was approaching so I advised him to get it done if he wanted the position, but no pressure if he didn't. We went over the role, the pay and the flexible schedule (he was worried he'd have to miss out on a fishing trip with his dad, but he could easily get the time off.) The position also looks great on a resume for any future jobs he might be looking at or when applying to college. We ended the call with him saying he would come to the office and drop his application off in person.

The next day I got a text from my ex saying that I should stop pressuring his nephew to ""follow my path."" I responded that I'm not pressuring him, just presenting him with an opportunity he seemed excited about. If he doesn't want to pursue it there's no sweat off my back I'm just trying to help the kid out. My ex responded that he wasn't comfortable with me working with his nephew to which I responded ""That's because no one in your family is comfortable working period!"" 

It was low, I know, but I can't stand to see a kid with so much potential be discouraged by his family to try and reach it. But I also understand that most of them now see me as some socialist, left-wing, harlot who left the Golden Boy of their family. 

AITAH for encouraging this kid to get a job working with me even though his uncle (my ex) has told me he isn't comfortable with it?

DISCLAIMER: My knowledge in gambling is slim. I‚Äôm not going to pretend I‚Äôm an expert, but I do want to shed light on this, as there are a *LOT* of references the show has to playing cards and gambling in general‚Äîso much so that it‚Äôd be a missed opportunity to not make this post. So if I get anything wrong or you have more insight, feel free to share! (Also, please be considerate. Not everything here will end up meaning anything and that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs better to look deep into a subject and get things wrong along the way than it is to do nothing. Critical thinking/media analysis is incredibly important to further understand stories like this.)


The Lumon building is a Casino disguised as an Office Building

	THEMATIC RELEVANCE: Comparing the unwanted lives of a 9-5 office job and gambling at casinos. You go to a confined building, sit at a screen all day pressing buttons, and lose track of time until you have to leave. Both of which are not healthy, but you keep coming back anyways because you need money and/or your life sucks. Both places like to draw in people who are vulnerable, which is why many casino and office business function like cults (mafias and MLMs). The casino side of Lumon may be Dieter, and the business side is Kier. (As a writer, if these two comparisons aren‚Äôt being made, then I‚Äôll have to write it myself because DAMN is it smart.)

	INSPIRATION/WRITERS‚Äô PERSPECTIVE: While I haven‚Äôt seen Twin Peaks (I know I know, I‚Äôve been meaning to watch it I will) the writers are heavily inspired by it, so it would make sense that Severance‚Äôs themes, cinematography, plot points, etc., would draw from the show.

	The Lumon building and casinos both have‚Ä¶

	1. Long halls that feel like they last for miles.

	2. Square ceiling tiles and colored mat floors.

	3. Limited amount of clocks/strange clocks, no windows or natural light.

	4. Lumon building is a rectangle business building on the outside, and u shaped in the inside, like a casino. The further inside you go, the more apparent the gambling themes get. The building also faces a body of water/is on water, like casinos.

	5. (Striking opposition) Casinos interiors lack sharp angles to make you more likely to not think about what you‚Äôre doing (hence why some people pace back and forth when trying to think). So why would the Severance halls be filled to the brim with 90 degrees turns? Perhaps to make the workers think they have agency? (Like Harmony said: ‚ÄúThe surest way to tame a prisoner is to let him believe he‚Äôs free.) Maybe the halls are more reminiscent of a prison?

	6. Constant ring of c notes from slot machines, like the c(#) notes from the elevators.

	7. In S2E4, Mr. Milchick says: ‚ÄúMarshmallows are for team players, Dylan.‚Äù Casinos often offer ‚Äúfree‚Äù drinks and food but only to gamblers (or players). This might correlate to the waffle parties that are given and toy prizes you earn when you complete (or win) a file, and why Cobel promised MDR an all-floor mixer ‚Äúwhen they earn it‚Äù.

	8. https://www.npr.org/2022/07/31/1110882487/dod-slot-machines-overseas-bases This entire article. How overseas US military bases (especially the navy) are connected to gambling/slots. How this could relate to Irving is really interesting. It would explain why overseas US military bases are an accepted answer to the innie survey question of ‚ÄúName a US state or territory‚Äù.

	9. MDR desks are shaped like cards ordered in the game Bridge (NOTE: I believe the card order isn‚Äôt an actual play, just to display.) The computers and its files/numbers are set up more like video poker, solitaire, and sudoku than office computer files. They don‚Äôt even use most of the keyboard. And you are organizing numbers into 5 categories (cards) for the *entire time.*

	10. Video game references: 8 bit Kier and 8 bit Irving. 8 bit Kier is shown when Helly completes/wins a file.

	
Playing Cards

Some characters represent a suit and level on playing cards. For instance‚Ä¶

GEMMA = (Ace of)‚ô¶Ô∏è Her name is *Gem*ma, knits in a fisherman pattern (diamond pattern), and is very connected to nature. When a red diamond is cut in half, they are üî∫üîª, like on the testing room elevators.

IRVING = (Ace of) ‚ô†Ô∏è He plays *Ace of Spades*, his palette knife looks like a spade, and spades represent soldiers/weapons. The role of a spade is to trick players and get information from them, as Irving is probably doing with Burt and Fields.

REGHABI = (Ace of) ‚ô£Ô∏è She uses a bat (club) to kill Graner. (Sorry, wish I had more info on her)

PETEY = (Ace of) ‚ô•Ô∏è Has a heart on his mug (funeral photo) and plays red cards with June (funeral photo). A heart‚Äôs role is to avoid players or run away, and Petey runs and avoids people. He may also reference the ‚Äúsuicide king‚Äù card, who, well‚Ä¶ dies.

DRUMMOND = (Jack of?) ‚ô¶Ô∏è His name may be a play on the word ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù. Frolic may symbolize diamonds, which is why he has the word ‚Äúfrolic‚Äù on his hand.


Each SUIT represents a TEMPER‚Ä¶

	WOE = ‚ô•Ô∏è Hearts symbolize emotion, specifically woeful emotions (‚Äúheartfelt‚Äù, ‚Äúheartbroken‚Äù‚Ä¶) 

	FROLIC = ‚ô¶Ô∏è Diamonds symbolize the earth and luxury, or fun. Frolic means playful.

	DREAD = ‚ô£Ô∏è Clubs symbolize strength, knowledge, and merchants/working class. This is mostly dread due to process of elimination, I don‚Äôt have solid evidence for connection.

	MALICE = ‚ô†Ô∏è Spades symbolize authority, weapons, and soldiers. Fighting and controlling very anger/malice oriented.

	1. With this in mind, if it would make sense if refining is partially based on video poker.

	2. Several card brands, such as Bicycle, make their card sides mirror each other‚Äîso the bottom half is reversed from the top‚Äîmuch like innies and outies, and MDR shadows.


General Terminology

	Jack = The face card before the kings and queens. Also referred to as knaves. During Irving‚Äôs wellness session, Ms. Casey states: ‚Äúyour outie has no fear of muggers or knaves‚Äù.

	Joker = A jester face card introduced during the American Civil War to act as a wild card. One of the four tempers is represented as a jester.

	VPIP = (Poker) Stands for ‚ÄúVoluntarily Put (money) In the Pot‚Äù. Pip‚Äôs VIP card may reference this.

	Pips = (Bridge) Any card that is not a face card. Phillip Eagan went by the nickname ‚ÄúPip‚Äù, and his bar is called ‚ÄúPip‚Äôs‚Äù.

	Chips = Tokens in Poker that represent money. Different colors are different values in money‚Äîtypically, blue is $10, green is $25, and black is $100. If we take the value of keycards into account (MDR = blue, O&D= green, Security = black), this parallel would add up. Also, MDR must use tokens instead of money in order to eat from the vending machine. The Severance devices put in people‚Äôs head are also referred to as chips.

	Hand = (Bridge) A deal or board, or a player holding the cards. This might hint to why Drummond has the word ‚Äúfrolic‚Äù on his hand.
 
	Rabbit (hunting) = A shared or undealt community card. Also a controversial and tiring method in Hold ‚ÄòEm. The rabbit/duck is seen/mentioned twice: once in Mr. Milchick‚Äôs office, and another when Gemma is talking to Mark about her mail tests. And, although loose connection, one of Burt‚Äôs goodbye posters has a rabbit on it. 

	Duck = (Poker) A pair of two cards. (Bridge) To intentionally play low/lose in order to trick the opponent and set up a suit. Relates to the duck/rabbit illusion.

	Mark = An inexperienced player who is easy to be taken advantage over. I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs necessarily inexperienced, but Dylan did say that he had a ‚Äúfreshman fluke‚Äù on a file, and he is easily manipulated by people above him (Cobel, Milchick, Helena‚Ä¶)

	Scout = (Sports betting) A player who waits to bet a lot of money. This *might* reference how Mark waited to reintegrate/flood his chip and now he‚Äôs ‚Äúbetting a lot‚Äù.

	Fish = A player who is unskilled. Although another very loose connection, Mark has two pet fish.

	George = A generous tipper. Dylan‚Äôs surname is George, possibly referencing how he is the best at refining the numbers and earns the most prizes.

	Nosebleed = When the stakes are high. When Mark and Petey‚Äôs nose bleed, it‚Äôs a bad sign of reintegration sickness‚Ä¶ otherwise a very high stake for them. Drummond was also very concerned about the nosebleed.

	Paint = (Poker) Any face card. Irving paints while listening to Ace of Spades to send his innie a message.

	Pineapples = Variation of the game Hold ‚ÄòEm. Pineapples are frequently seen in the show as a status of wealth and bargaining/manipulation.

	Laws = The rules of Bridge. Devon says ‚Äúlaw‚Äù after threatening to push Reghabi off a bridge. She also says solitary, possibly referencing Solitaire.

	Coffeehousing = Misleading the opponent by asking improper questions and generally tricking the opponent. Devon receiving coffee from Gabriela‚Äôs innie might allude to this.

	Riggs: Bobby Riggs was a tennis player and prolific gambler. Gemma‚Äôs tennis room may reference The Battle of the Sexes (1973), or match between Billie Jean *King* and Bobby *Riggs*, where Riggs would often wear strange outfits (ie. His sugar daddy jacket) to express his chauvinistic ideals and interest in King (so Dr. Maur is the Riggs equivalent). Helly‚Äôs middle/fake name is also Riggs. Helly‚Äôs name may also be inspired from the words ‚Äúrigged‚Äù and ‚Äúeggs‚Äù.

	Scissors Coup = (Bridge) A play that prevents defenders (players) from communicating. Coup is a frequiently used term in bridge. When MDR are walking to the Perpetuity Wing, they talk about how there might‚Äôve been a coup that separated the departments. Also, Kier tamed the tempers in Scissor Cave, as in preventing the emotions from interacting with him; cutting them away.

	Board = (Bridge) All the tools presented in the game, a method of scoring in the game, and/or the entire deal of a game. This could be referring to The Board itself, as they seem to rule and overlook the company.

	Key Cards = (Bridge) Any ace or trump king. A self explanatory parallel.

	Bingo: Dylan passed out an Eagan bingo to everyone in S1E3. Pretty self-explanatory on how this relates to gambling and casinos.

	Eye-in-the-sky = Casino term for closed circuit cameras that monitor many places. This phrase is also commonly used in the military. June‚Äôs band, *Fissureman*, references this: ‚ÄúBuild a sky in my eye, that perfect blue‚Äù

	Dummy = (Bridge) The declarer‚Äôs partner‚Äîone of the most frequently used terms in bridge. In S2S1, Gwen mentions her old work place had CPR dummies, which may reference this (this could also be a reference to The Office).

	Exit card = (Bridge) A card used to let down the guard of the opponent, temporarily giving up the lead. Right after Fields discusses Burt‚Äôs fate and Irving is surprised, Burt says: ‚Äúhe‚Äôs looking for the exit.‚Äù

also i'm Muslim, and shouldn't be drinking, period.. it's currently Ramadan, so im not drinking at all this month..

i'm also a HUGE stoner.. i do edibles as a pre-workout, and smoking helps me focus (esp if combined with coffee).. i'm much more into that herb life than drinking.. if i go on a 10 hr drive, then i'm having an edible before hand, and taking a spliff break every 2 - 3 hrs..

i don't like to drink and drive, as it's a whole diff ballgame than smoking weed / taking edibles and driving..

weed has never caused me to make a bad decision..

now as far as alcohol goes, i have lost my temper off alcohol a few times and said shit to my wife that i heavily regretted the next AM.. it's happened a very few times, and there was an active horrible argument going on those times BEFORE i went out to drink, but doesn't make that any more justified..

so with all that background, i'm wondering if any bars serve stuff like this (or something similar)..

Hey band directors, parents, and students!

If your school band is looking to raise money for uniforms, instruments, travel, competition fees, or just keeping the music alive, this is the place to swap ideas. Fundraising doesn't have to be boring car washes and bake sales (though hey, those still work!).

üëá **Before you read, drop your favorite band fundraiser in the comments!**  
Let‚Äôs help each other make some noise... and some cash!

# üé∂ Creative Band-Themed Fundraising Ideas:

**3. March-a-Thon**

**4. Battle of the Bands**  
Invite local student bands to compete in a fundraiser concert. Sell tickets, merch, and snacks.

**5. Instrument Petting Zoo**  
Host an event where younger kids can try out band instruments with guidance from your players. Charge a small admission fee.

Rent the band out to play at community events, birthday parties, or local sports games for a donation.

Pair a student concert with a spaghetti dinner or chili cook-off. Sell tickets to cover both and make it a full evening event.

**10. Band Car Decals**  
Sell custom decals that show off school pride and support for the band. (‚ÄúProud Band Parent‚Äù is always a hit!)

**11. ""Name That Tune"" Competition**  
Host a trivia night where people guess songs played by the band or small ensembles.

**12. Uniform Sponsorships**  
Let local businesses or families sponsor new uniforms or instrument repairs in exchange for recognition at performances.

**13. Band-Themed Yard Signs**  
‚ÄúProud Home of a Marching Band Member‚Äù signs are perfect for fundraising and school spirit.

Anyway, That got me thinking, is british milk the same as in the US? like do they have 1%, 2%? I think in the US cafes usually use whole milk, but I think most ppl use 1,2, or skim milk at home, which would definitely lead to a more watery tea texture.

Let‚Äôs unpack this:

---

### üî• **Here‚Äôs the TL;DR on what‚Äôs shaking things up:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Avitia‚Äôs $5M AI Cancer Breakthrough**  
PacBridge Capital just threw $5 million at Avitia to supercharge their AI-powered molecular diagnostics. Translation? Faster, *smarter* cancer detection that could save countless lives. *Holy grail alert.* [More here](https://www.donews.com/news/detail/8/4784330.html).

2Ô∏è‚É£ **AI Notes: Bye-Bye, Burnout Documentation**  
Mobile-health Network Solutions just launched **AI Notes** ‚Äì an AI scribe that writes clinical notes *in real-time* during patient visits. It even understands thick accents and syncs with EHR systems. Doctors, your coffee breaks just got longer. [Details](https://www.newmediawire.com/news/mobile-health-network-solutions-unveils-ai-notes-next-generation-ai-medical-scribe-transforming-clinical-workflow-and-ehr-documentation-7079682).

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Canon‚Äôs AI-Powered X-Ray Vision (For Real)**  
Canon‚Äôs new *Alphenix Evolve Edition* uses AI to make heart procedures safer and sharper. Less radiation, better images, and yes ‚Äì they‚Äôre flexing this tech at ECR 2025. [Geek out here](https://ictandhealth.com/ai-health-news/canons-ai-boosts-interventional-cardiology-with-real-time-innovations).

**Why should you care?**  
Imagine: AI that spots cancer cells like a hyper-caffeinated pathologist. Clinical notes that write themselves. Heart scans so precise they‚Äôd make Dr. House nod in approval. This isn‚Äôt just incremental progress ‚Äì it‚Äôs healthcare doing a *Ctrl+Alt+Delete* on outdated systems.

**Biggest question for Reddit:**  
Is this the start of an AI-driven healthcare revolution, or just another hype train? And *crucially* ‚Äì will hospitals actually adopt this tech fast enough to matter?

New guy here, probably asking the same question you've all heard a million times, but hey, I‚Äôm on a journey, and I need some guidance. I‚Äôve recently gone down the espresso rabbit hole‚Äînot trying to be a coffee snob, just someone who wants a solid, reliable machine that makes a good cup without breaking the bank.

For years, I was that guy grabbing gas station coffee at 4 AM, thinking, ‚ÄúYep, this is fine.‚Äù Then, I ""leveled up"" to a $69 De‚ÄôLonghi with a bag of that preground yellow-label stuff everyone raves about. Thought I was living the high life‚Ä¶ until my wife scored a Breville 800ESXL for $30 at a thrift store. Game. Changer. Suddenly, my taste buds woke up, and that yellow bag hasn‚Äôt been touched since.

Now, here‚Äôs my dilemma: while the Breville is miles ahead of what I had, it doesn‚Äôt always pull the hottest shots, and since we make a lot of milk-based drinks, I‚Äôm thinking about upgrading. But wow‚Äîthose shiny, fancy machines come with some serious sticker shock.

So, the classic question: **For someone like me, who makes only one or two drinks at a time, what‚Äôs the real difference between what I have now and a $1,500-$2,000 machine?** I don‚Äôt think I want one with a built-in grinder‚ÄîI‚Äôll either stick with what I have or upgrade separately.

I want something solid, but not overkill. If I can get similar quality for less, great. If spending a bit more actually makes a big difference, I‚Äôm open to it. Also, are there any brands or models I should avoid? If that‚Äôs something best left to private messages, feel free to DM me.

He eats cheesesteak subs and pizza, drinks coke and ginger ale, has ice cream before bed most nights. He buys big bags of Doritos. On road trips he eats snickers and twinkies. 

We will typically eat a healthy dinner together. Then he typically has another ‚Äúdinner‚Äù before bed (like a giant bowl of pasta). 

He is so skinny. Bony. His friends from high school all have soft padded guts. He is concave. 

I have a pic of him consuming an entire IHOP Grand Slam breakfast - two of everything - while I drank coffee. Oh, he also always orders a side of mayo with his eggs. Always.

On the other hand, he (inadvertently) intermittent fasts. He will often go a whole day just having coffee, or a banana or one egg. He says it ‚Äúslows him down‚Äù or he got too busy or he was anxious about getting things done. If he is worried about something (which is frequent - he is on anxiety meds finally) he just doesn‚Äôt have an appetite.

So, a few weeks ago, I was having a rough time. Work was soul-sucking, my love life was deader than my houseplants, and I was starting to think maybe Mercury was in permanent retrograde just for me. Instead of doing something productive, like therapy or, you know, taking responsibility for my actions, I decided to consult a higher power: a random psychic I found online.

  
Her name? Madame Celestia. (Because of course it was.) Her website looked like it was built in 2007 using Microsoft Word Art, but I was desperate. She promised a ‚Äúdeeply personal spiritual roadmap‚Äù that would guide me to inner peace‚Äîfor the low, low price of $40.

  
Now, I‚Äôm not completely stupid. I had doubts. But then I saw the magic words: ‚ÄúLimited-time offer.‚Äù Clearly, the spirits were speaking to me, and they were saying buy now or suffer eternal confusion.

  
So, I sent the money, along with my birth date and a short description of my troubles (which was basically: ‚ÄúWhy does my life suck?‚Äù).

  
24 hours later, she sends me a 3-page PDF filled with the deepest, most cosmic wisdom imaginable:

  
Your past has shaped your present (Revolutionary.)

Your aura is clouded by negative energy (You mean my unpaid bills?)

Hey basketball families and coaches!

If your team needs extra cash for things like jerseys, travel, tournament fees, or new equipment, it‚Äôs time to get creative. Basketball Fundraiser ideas don‚Äôt have to be boring! There are so many ways to lean into the basketball theme and make fundraising fun for players and supporters.

üëá **Before you read, drop your favorite basketball fundraiser in the comments!**  
Let‚Äôs swap ideas and help each other out.

# üèÜ Basketball-Themed Fundraising Ideas:

**1. Free Throw-a-Thon**  
Players collect pledges based on how many free throws they can sink in a set time. Great for practice and fundraising at the same time!

**2. Coaches vs. Players Game**  
Host a silly, lighthearted game where the coaches take on the players. Sell tickets, snacks, and maybe even let the crowd ""buy"" fun rules (like forcing the coaches to play in costumes).

**3. Trick Shot Contest**  
Charge a small entry fee for players, parents, or community members to show off their wildest trick shots. Offer a prize to the winner!

**4. 3-Point Shootout**  
Similar to a free throw challenge but with 3-pointers. Get pledges per shot made or charge an entry fee.

**5. Basketball Skills Camp**  
Host a mini camp or clinic for younger kids in the community, with your players and coaches running the drills. Charge a registration fee.

**6. Slam Dunk Bake Sale**  
Add a basketball spin to a traditional bake sale with themed goodies‚Äîthink cookies decorated like basketballs and ""slam dunk"" brownies.

**7. March Madness Bracket Pool**  
Run a bracket challenge during the NCAA tournament with a portion of the entry fees supporting the team.

**8. Hoops for Hoops Raffle**  
Raffle off fun basketball-related prizes like game tickets, signed merch, or sports gear.

**9. Half-Court Shot Challenge**  
At halftime of a game, offer spectators the chance to pay for a shot at half-court with a cash prize for anyone who makes it.

**10. Buzzer Beater Car Wash**  
Team up for a classic car wash fundraiser, but with a competitive twist: players work in teams and race to see who can wash the most cars in an hour.

**11. Jersey Day Fundraiser**  
Have a spirit day at school or in the community where everyone donates to wear their favorite basketball jersey.

**12. Dribble-a-Thon**  
Players get pledges to dribble continuously for a certain distance or time. Make it fun with obstacles and challenges.

**13. Basketball Movie Night**  
Host a screening of a classic basketball movie (like *Space Jam* or *Coach Carter*) in the gym. Sell tickets, popcorn, and drinks.

**14. Pop-A-Shot Tournament**  
Set up arcade-style basketball games and have a tournament. Charge an entry fee and give out prizes.

**15. Hoops & Hops (for adults)**  
Partner with a local brewery or restaurant to host a social night with part of the proceeds benefiting the team. Include raffles or basketball trivia.

# üçø And don‚Äôt forget the easy brochure fundraisers:

**16. Gourmet Popcorn Fundraiser**  
[Hand out brochures for delicious popcorn flavors](https://fundraisingzone.com/brochure-fundraisers/poppin-popcorn-fundraiser/)‚Äîeasy for families to sell and a proven winner.

**17. Cookie Dough Fundraiser**  
Perfect for teams because it's simple to organize, and who doesn‚Äôt love cookie dough? [Check out this free brochure program.](https://fundraisingzone.com/brochure-fundraisers/20-cookie-dough-fundraising-ideas/)

**18.‚òï Fuel the Fans: Gourmet Coffee Fundraiser**

Parents, coaches, and fans all need their caffeine fix‚Äîwhy not make it a fundraiser?

With a [gourmet coffee brochure fundraiser](https://fundraisingzone.com/brochure-fundraisers/coffee-fundraiser/), your team can sell premium coffee blends to family, friends, and local supporters. It's a perfect option for basketball season because:

* Early morning practices = coffee.
* Weekend tournaments = coffee.
* Bleacher cheering = coffee.

These fundraisers are super simple: just send home the brochures, collect orders, and your team earns profits on every bag sold. Bonus points if you sell hot coffee at games, too!

üí¨ **Now it‚Äôs your turn!**  
Help us build the ultimate basketball fundraiser list by sharing your team‚Äôs go-to ideas below.

TLDR: After a traumatic job hunting experience and with good opportunities in EY GDS, I want to pursue a long career in this organization. I need your opinions on whether this is a good decision or what can be done better.

# Details

***Who am I***

I am a Senior Analyst in Technical Consulting division at EY GDS India, specializing in MERN stack and have 1.5 years of experience. My previous company was a startup, where I had to learn a lot of concepts and had to work in different fields all at once. It was a good company and I left at a high note. Joined EY this month.

***Joining EY***

I wanted to switch to a different organization since I had been working in the startup for over an year with no promotion and benefits. My job hunting experience was extremely traumatic. No one would give a job to a 1.5 years exp guy, and I got rejected in more than 50 companies.

One day, an HR from EY called me, and in 1 week my interview and everything got scheduled, and now I have joined this organization. After that painful experience finding a job, I don't want to do that in the next 4-5 years at least.

***Current Company Scenario***

I work in a hybrid model and stay in my home. So no added expenses and reduced transport costs. In fact in my previous company, I even had to buy coffee and make it myself when I had to drink (the cash flow wasn't much).

Good office, and I can mix well with people in professional sector, so I won't be isolated. My reporting manager, aka counsellor, is a decent guy who has technical knowledge and does his job properly. He regularly checks up on my learning progress, provides additional materials, helped me out figuring my mistakes and all.

There seems to be lots of learning opportunities, and I have already been assigned a project in a domain in which I excel. Work will start soon and I am hyped.

***My Plans***

Since I do not want to change anytime soon and want to utilize this company's learning resources as much as possible, I have plans to stay at least for 4-5 years. But if I stay for such a long time, then I believe I can get the badges and even apply for the Tech MBA (not sure how important it is, but it is sponsored, so...)

But applying to their MBA means I won't be able to leave the organization for a long time. So I guess I will need to stay for at least 8-9 years in the same organization. In such a scenario, I guess I will get the stamp of loyalty, although I don't know if it will come handy.

***The Question***

The approach that I am taking, do you think is a good one? If I stay in a single organization for so long, I am losing the opportunity for solid increments. Keeping that in mind, do you still think it is a good decision to stay in EY for so long or shall I switch to another big 4 firm and pursue higher studies from there.

I believe there is nothing as a ""good"" company. Every organization has its pros and cons. But from a salaryman's perspective with very simple ambitions (1 international tour yearly, 2 nationals) and maybe a family in the next 5 years, do you think I should stay in this org or switch to another one for higher increments?

So for those of you lost like I was, apparently you have to:    

Click on equipment tab.   
Click on your grinder/coffee machine.   
A menu will open up.   
In the bottom right corner will be your repair button.   
Then you will also be able upgrade your machine! I did not know you could do that!

My concern is what food pairs well with coffee/espresso themed. I was thinking like pastry‚Äôs, mini sandwiches, desserts. But I‚Äôd also like actual food too bc half my fam likes to party. 

Also what games would be acceptable to play?
I feel like with 75+ people it‚Äôd be hard to keep everyone‚Äôs attention so maybe no games?

Sharing my story, stats, and progress here for two reasons, to celebrate my success as well as to encourage others in their journey to normal weight. Pictures are scale, today, and prior to Starting (I don‚Äôt have a lot because I always avoided pictures).

65M, SW 310,CW 249.7. I just took my 14th shot (7.5mg) - like most people i started on 2.5mg for 4 weeks and then to 5mg, and I HOPE to stay at 7.5 (maybe 8 or 9 if I get the urge) until i reach my goal weight and go on maintenance. I do expect this will be a lifetime or at least a long term commitment to Tirzepatide. My first milestone was 275 and I set 2 other intermediate milestones (250 yeah, and 225) before I target 200 which would be an ideal weight for me.

I have lost a good deal of weight in the past using Atkins approach; it works and the pounds come off but at least for me it is not sustainable. It was a diet - not a lifestyle and after getting off a bit from the very low carb diet the weight naturally came back (nothing new to others here I'm certain.). Then I retired in June 2023 at age 62, and thought a great hobby would be home brewing. The good news is it was fun and I managed to brew some truly exceptional IPA's (my view and those who also enjoyed a great craft beer). The bad news, having great beer on tap in the home was my downfall. It was so easy to have a few beers every night and before long I was at my heaviest ever (310) and was at a crossroads. 

My brother mentioned a very good friend of his had opened his own Med Spa (an MD) and asked if I had ever considered ""the meds"". I talked to the doctor (a friend) and got my first order of Tirzepatide for $700 for a 2-month plan (4 weeks @ 2.5 and 4 weeks at 5mg). I also knew that other changes were needed, it was not going to be ""just inject something and the meds do it all). I started with my 1st injection on 12/5/2024 and also the 1st exercise routine I had in many years. I have missed only 1 day on the bike since (Christmas day) and beginning of January I purchased a home gym on Marketplace ($150 - lots of equipment on sale!) as I wanted to add weight training to prevent muscle loss and also it is better than cardio alone for helping the process. 

I am lucky that I really have had zero side effects and have lost at a steady rate and above the general guidelines (helps starting at 310 - lots to work with). I am currently at about 3 pounds a week and using that to target my 3rd milestone date (I like dates as a former IT director - a date and goal along with a plan leads to results). I do in fact feel more energetic (opposite of the fatigue I see many mention) but I believe that comes from the daily workout - first thing each day after a 1/2 cup of coffee and dogs let out). At the same time I ended my home brewing career; it was 200% clear to me that I had to choose healthy or brewing; I miss the end results of tasting a great brew that I made myself - but it simply had to go.

We (my wife and I) are visiting my oldest son in April (Easter week) and he is not aware of my journey. If my plan holds I will be somewhere in the 230's by the time we see him; and our 1st grandson who will be 18 months old at the visit. I was embarrassed at my size the last time we visited (they are in Dallas area - we are in Connecticut) and looking forward to their reactions. 

At my current weight I clearly notice the changes; face was first like many people experience, but I have unpacked some of my favorite older t-shirts that were packed away (Jets and UConn fanatic here!). And recently had to put on a dress shirt and found the 3XL ones in my closet fit like a tent; glad I have a few XLT on the hangers. The shirts tell me a story but I still have a good sized belly. I think as I approach the 3rd milestone this is where I will see the most visible (self image anyway) changes to my mid section. I do have a muscular frame and believe that at 5'11"" 200 pounds is really an ideal weight for me (BMI has never worked for me - was an athlete up thru college and always more than average muscle mass).

At 65 it was a bit daunting to start; I felt too old to try this (weight loss) again but it was now or never. Some 3 months in I feel totally different and with the help of the meds I know I can maintain the changes in lifestyle that have me where I am today. I don't believe that I will be able to simply stop when I'm at goal; the meds are what allow me to maintain the changes without feeling like I am on a diet. I have and will continue to try to stay at a lower dose than the max, hopeful that I will be able to reduce when I hit my goal and continue the medication even if I HAVE to go with Lilly Direct for the lifetime support. 

So - to those here offering stories, information, and support ""Thank you, Thank you, Thank you"". To anyone starting out: make a commitment to yourself, stick to the plan, and let the meds Help with the process.

When I do a dry run with no coffee/ water and press the cylinder head/ pressure gauge it‚Äôs smooth and noiseless no issues.

When I have the device properly loaded and apply pressure, it seems like the cylinder head is getting skewed in the barrel so instead of smoothly applying pressure and getting the espresso out, it sticks and then slips as the pressure forces it past that sticking point only to hit another sticking point. There is a creaking sound as I slip past each one of these. I‚Äôve inspected and lubricated the orings but that hasn‚Äôt fixed the problem. I tried grinding super coarse to see if I was just grinding too fine. At a super course grind it still sticks but the pressure doesn‚Äôt get above 4 bars. So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs related to grind size.

The espresso I get out eventually is great, it‚Äôs not in any of the recommended times, and I‚Äôm basically comparing it with what I could get from Starbucks. So I‚Äôm sure someone better versed in espresso could tell me how meh my shots are. But huge upgrade from the bucks.

Has anyone felt homesick for their expat country?,"I moved back to the UK last summer after living in NZ for four years with my wife and child (who was born in NZ). I moved from Auckland to London and we love our life back here in London.

Both my wife and I work in financial services, and we managed to secure good jobs, that pay well in one of the worst job markets I have ever seen. We also feel so good to be back close to friends and family and we love being in a place where we see greater and more fulfilling options for our career. 

Despite this, over the past couple of months I have had this strange ‚Äúhomesick‚Äù feeling for New Zealand. Maybe it was because the UK winter was so bleak and I really missed the sunny Jan and Feb days in NZ or maybe it‚Äôs just that the adjustment to being away from NZ took longer to kick in but it‚Äôs a weird indescribable feeling. 

This was especially the case throughout Feb and almost every day the entire month I just wanted to move back to NZ. Every small thing from ordering a flat white in a coffee shop to having avocado toast to drinking craft beer (all stupid examples I know) reminded me of NZ. 

Even though I don‚Äôt plan on moving back to NZ (anytime soon) and I am extremely happy with our life in London and feel glad that we could resettle back here so smoothly, it is a weird feeling that I can‚Äôt shake off. 

Has anyone else had this feeling? Did you ever act on this feeling and move back to the country you were an expat in? 

Also any Kiwis out here (or expats living in NZ), what is the current situation like in NZ? It was pretty dire when we left with the economy and lots of firms were making redundancies, hope the situation has improved - Kia Kaha.

My current ratios are 17g in (since it's a lighter roast the bean density takes up a lot more room in my basket), and 40g out, in about 22 seconds including pre-infusion.

Also, would it be better to steam milk first and pull the shot after so that it's not sitting as long? If so, how do i keep my milk from not separating the foam?

My fianc√© (36M) and I 34(F) have been together for almost 5 years and we've been living together for 4, no kids yet. He comes from a very tight-knit family, one of those families that act like a clan. They seem to have their own language, their own world, they only talk about themselves and the ones they know.

For context, this tight-knit family is composed by my partner, his sister (40y, that still lives with her parents), his parents and an aunt.

My in-laws are good people. I have a very good relationship with my FIL, we have similar personalities and get along very well. We can have long conversations and he reminds me a lot of my grandfather, in a very good way. My MIL is ok - we don't have the most close relationship and have a very distinct personality, but we do get along. The same with the aunt.

The SIL is the one I have the most trouble with: she's extremely extroverted (I'm very introverted), and has an attitude of a princess, like the world revolves around her. She expects everyone to cater to her needs and acts likes she's the boss of the family, including my partner, who has left home 4 years ago already. But since she still lives with her parents and is single, she seems to have dictatorship powers and acts like it. We do have totally distinct personalities and can't seem to find a common ground on almost anything we talk about. My relationship with her, specially because of her atitude, is basically neutral. I don't make an effort to see her, and she also doesn't do any effort. In 5 years, we never went to grab a coffee together alone, so that's that.

Since last year, I've been having a real hard time with her attitude, because the last development is that she now bosses the whole family to take at least one vacation per year together. Mind you that we lived the whole time 5 minutes away from them, currently we live around 30 min, it's not like we're not together every single week, almost.

She decides the dates, the budget, the place, all alone, and just ""communicates"" to her family her decision. The problem is that I'm never invited directly to these trips. My partner is the one who invites me and that makes me feel like the outsider I feel to the family.

Last year, she did the same, and my partner was the one who ""invited"" me after they decided everything - which I find weird already, because IMO that means you start from the point where you don't consider the person initially, it's an afterthought. I was just supposed to pay for my part, not being able to give any input.

I didn't go on that vacation for multiple reasons: budget, no PTO available and mostly her attitude.

This year, on her birthday dinner, she proceeded to tell the whole table that she was booking some dates in June and that ""she was expecting the whole family to join!!"", ""we just have to decide the destiny and we're going!"".

I was there on the table, along with friends, and not once she talked to me about it. Not a single ""what do you think?"". Nevertheless, she spent the whole dinner just chit-chatting with my partner right by my side where the family should go on that vacation. Not once she considered if we have PTO available, budget available (we just bought a house!) or if we wanted to go: she just assumed my partner would say yes and that's it, which he basically did, but not once he talked to me about it.

I'm really starting to get the feeling that they will never see me as family or even consider me for these type of decisions, which only reinforces my idea that I shouldn't go. My partner is the type of person who kinda leaves me ""on the side"" whenever he's with his family and hardly says any word to me - I think he really has a hard time remembering I'm there. Going on a trip with them makes me wonder if I would be just the person who took photos and just stayed there alone.

This, unfortunately, makes me feel like there's a pattern that's going to leak to every single thing in my life, specially when we have kids. They are going to speak only with my partner about anything related to our child? Are they going to exclude him too, or consider him family because he's blood related and I'm not?

The same goes for small things like WhatsApp groups: my SIL is the one who coordinates every single family group (of course), with the close family, extended family, etc. but she never bothered to even considered adding me into one (even if it was with extended family). My family ALWAYS adds my partner to every single group conversation.

I'm so stressed with these family dynamics. We just bought a house, still recovering financially from this, still furnishing the place. I'm dying to have the trip of my life to NY (I'm from Europe) this year before kids, I can't budget a single dime into it, and my SIL keeps pushing trips into us (him, in this case) and this is causing me a lot of anxiety and wondering about how the future will play out.

Please bear in mind that my partner does take trips with friends, and I'm totally ok with it. It's not one of those cases where ""if I don't go, then you can't go too"", because he does it multiple times during the year and I always have a blast getting to know the adventures he's in. But this stings a lot, because it's family, and I always feel like the outsider all the time.",8,1741279406.0,inlaws,9,1.0,False

He sent me a like a little while ago and after talking for a few days, he asked me to get coffee, which I thought was too soon so I suggested that we keep talking to which he agreed. Since then he‚Äôs been kinda distant but still answered and initiated convo but was very slow. Earlier this week, he asked me out to the movies, so I this time I said yes since we‚Äôve talked but unlike my previous dates he takes a long time to plan it out. After I agreed, he said ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and the next day he asked for me to come over to a theater near where he was which is like 40 min away to which I said no, so he chose a location near my house. However, no mentioning of the time we‚Äôd meet nor the exact movie theater address, so I assumed he wasn‚Äôt into me that much or whatever. Then this morning (two days since he asked me to meet the second time), he asks if we should have lunch before watching the movie without establishing an exact day/time.

# Here‚Äôs What the Market‚Äôs Missing

After years of struggling, DAVIDsTEA has¬†**cleaned up its balance sheet, cut costs, and turned its operations around**. Their¬†**Q3/FY2024**¬†results showed solid revenue, expanding margins, and actual¬†**positive cash flow from operations**. Even better?

Yet the market is still asleep at the wheel. A company pulling in¬†**$60M in revenue**¬†should not be trading at a¬†**$15M market cap**.

Beyond the numbers,¬†**DAVIDsTEA is a well-known brand**¬†with a loyal following and a streamlined operation post-restructuring. That makes it an¬†**ideal acquisition candidate**¬†for a larger player looking to dominate the specialty tea market.

Who could come knocking?

* **Starbucks**‚Äîlooking for a strong tea brand to complement its coffee dominance.
* **Nestl√© or Unilever**‚Äîboth actively expanding in the beverage space.
* **A private equity firm**‚Äîbuying a company this cheap and scaling it wouldn‚Äôt take much.

And the best part?¬†**With $8M in cash and no major debt, this isn‚Äôt a distressed asset‚Äîit‚Äôs a legitimate business trading at a ridiculous discount.**

# The Market Wakes Up

Some analysts already see DAVIDsTEA heading¬†**back above $1 in the near term**, especially if Q4 numbers stay strong. That‚Äôs a¬†**2x move from here**, but if a serious buyer steps in,¬†**$3-$5 per share isn‚Äôt unrealistic**.

The stock has flown under the radar while markets chase AI hype and meme stocks, but¬†**value always gets recognized eventually**. At some point, either a takeover rumor, improved earnings, or a simple re-rating of the stock could send this soaring.

# Risks? Sure, But the Setup is Strong

1j4zjoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1j4zjoo/having_a_meh_day_need_some_supportencouragement/,"Having a ""meh"" day üòû Need some support/encouragement.","15 days in, and just had 3 good days in a row. Actually, the third day (yesterday) was pretty rad. Started to be able to see the beauty in things again, played with my dog a little more, drove with no problem. Today, though, is shaping up to be a ""meh"" day. Granted, I woke up after three hours and had a tough time getting back to sleep, it's cold and ugly outside, and my tummy hurts a little (I'm sure because, although my appetite is finally coming back, I had a burger and some fries for dinner last night and my body is still adjusting to eating again). I know it's still early on, and I need to cut myself some slack, but sometimes the tough times make you temporarily lose sight of the progress you've made.
That all being said, I came up with some concerns to list to see if anyone could help with them, either remedy or just support:
 üçë Facial and jaw tension and pressure around the eyes-I use some heat, and shakti head band, and magnesium glycinate to try to remedy. Does this go away after awhile? Did anything help in the meantime? Chiropractor? The jaw tension sucks. I don't grind my teeth, it's more that they are stuck in a slightly open position and kinda feels like they freeze there, if that makes sense.
 üçë The ever-popular sleep question. Mine pertains to how long to keep using a sleep aid. I just started taking trazodone, and still haven't slept through the night yet. But if you were on a sleep aid, when did you wean off and just try to sleep on your own?
 üçë I have a very slight tremor, mainly in my dominant hand. Did you have this? Did it go away?
 üçë It's hard for me to sit still...especially today. I had to take a piece of a hydroxyzine earlier just so I could stop pacing and actually sit on the couch. Should I expect to be calmer in the approaching weeks as the lexapro works more and more?
 üçë Coffee was always my comfort drink. When I quit Lexapro last Nov, I cut back to basically none. I am starting to be able to tolerate a little more (less than half a cup), but still have to watch out because it will raise my anxiety. If you had to cut back at first, when were you able to start drinking it again?
 üçë And, finally, with some of my days getting better, I'm starting to get more anxious about the immediate future and if I will continue to keep feeling better. Absurd, I know! But if you went through this, did the thoughts diminish?
There are other things, like peeing every 30 minutes or so, and constantly using eye drops, but these have the most priority with me right now. I guess today is just a day I need some support and encouragement. On my good days, I try to help out those I can. I appreciate you all so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,1741278849.0,lexapro,0,1.0,False
1j4zjhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/fallenlondon/comments/1j4zjhl/a_tale_of_yore_couriers_footprint/,A Tale of Yore: Courier's Footprint,"Gather round young ones and let me tell you a tale. A tale of the traumas that have lead me to hoard 31 cups of [Darkdrop Coffee](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/Darkdrop_Coffee) and 4 [Magnificent Feasts](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/Magnificent_Feast). Because SOME DAY I MIGHT NEED THEM!

Scholar of the Correspondence 21 (aka. Courier's Footprint) used to be a much more daunting undertaking for a few reasons.

1. The only way to raise it past 10 was to [spend plaques at the university](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/Perhaps_you_can_remember_something_useful). Which meant you needed 300 Watchful if you wanted to get to 21.
2. There weren't as many equipment slots. Importantly, most profession items occupied your weapon slot and Moods and some Adornments (like the Semiotic Monocle) occupied your Hat slot.
3. The stat caps were 200 and that was that. It was possible to overcap your stats as high as 215 but that required grinding 15 Notability with the correct PoSI specialization (back then you couldn't change specializations and Paramount Presence wasn't implemented).
4. Mood cards were much rarer back then.

If you had 200 Watchful and bought all the best Watchful gear from the Bazaar, including an Overgoat which was a requirement, you'd only reach 254 Watchful. A mood would boost that to 276. (Moods gave +30 at the time, but you couldn't wear the Monocle. I wonder if this is why they're now +22?) After that you had to nickle and dime the last 24 Watchful through a combination of seasonal items, items only available if you picked the right story path, Profession items, the Renown items (once they were added, they weren't there when I did it), Extraordinary Mind overcapping, and an Ubergoat. Keep in mind that these items generally replaced items that you got from the Bazaar so, for example, an Ubergoat only gets you 10 points closer over an Overgoat. For a long time, either the mind or the Ubergoat was a hard requirement. It wasn't possible to reach 300 Watchful without one of them.

*(Sidebar: It was possible to skip this nonsense if you were an Extraordinary Mind AND had an Ubergoat but goats were a much bigger deal back then. London was MUCH less profitable. A player doing a casual grind could get 150 to 200 echoes per day. At the extreme end of unhealthy grinding that could push 250. So for most players getting that goat would take a little over a year.)*

So the strategy was to crank your Watchful as high as you could without the Mood, which would get you to 18 or 19 SoTC (I only got to 18, I think 19 only became possible as more items were released). Then wait for a Mood to hit and try to blitz the rest. If you managed to get to 19 SoTC that would take 41 actions. If you only made it to 18 that took 60 actions. Plus any actions you took to manage the up to +5 CP of wounds you took with every action, which could be a lot if you were unlucky.

Now you might ask, why are you so focused on how many actions this takes? Can't you wait for more Mood cards? And yes, you could. I feel like I've seen a mood card a week since I got back so that would be a sane thing to do. However, back then you were lucky if you saw a few Mood cards a year. They were extremely rare. Waiting for a second mood could take months. The solution? Coffee!

In preparation for the sprint you'd hoard every Darkdrop Coffee you could get your hands on and especially Magnificent Feasts. Then you'd wait for a Mood to hit you and bolt for it. Having at least one feast was kind of crucial because the Coffee gave you wounds on top of the wounds you were already taking. A well timed feast to clear all that meant you didn't need to waste actions keeping yourself alive because if you hit the river it was all over.

As with so many things, this was all for bragging rights. IIRC the London's Nerve step of Paramount Presence was the first time SoTC 21 was useful for something.

I don't miss these days. I'm glad the game is more accessible now. But the old hostilities did occasionally result in fun stories.",12,1741278837.0,fallenlondon,0,0.94,False
1j4zjeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1j4zjeh/davidstea_dteaf_the_undervalued_takeover_target/,"DAVIDsTEA ($DTEAF): The Undervalued Takeover Target No One‚Äôs Watching: $0.47/Share, $15M Market Cap, $8M Cash, $60M+ Sales","DAVIDsTEA ($DTEAF) isn‚Äôt just another beaten-down retail stock‚Äîit‚Äôs an¬†**underrated turnaround story that no one is paying attention to**.

The company went public in 2015 with big ambitions, but the IPO¬†**flopped hard**¬†as execution issues and rising competition weighed on growth. Then came¬†**COVID-19**, which crushed brick-and-mortar retailers and pushed DAVIDsTEA into¬†**bankruptcy in 2020**. They closed¬†**nearly all their stores**, wiped out¬†**millions in debt**, and pivoted to a¬†**lean, e-commerce-focused business model**.

Fast forward to today:¬†**DAVIDsTEA is generating over $60M in sales, has $8M in cash, and is actually profitable on an operational basis.**¬†They‚Äôve cut out the dead weight, streamlined costs, and are quietly delivering solid financials.

***Yet the stock is still trading like a failing business.***

# Here‚Äôs What the Market‚Äôs Missing

After years of struggling, DAVIDsTEA has¬†**cleaned up its balance sheet, cut costs, and turned its operations around**. Their¬†**Q3/FY2024**¬†results showed solid revenue, expanding margins, and actual¬†**positive cash flow from operations**. Even better? A new IT system is¬†**saving them $4M a year**, making operations leaner and more efficient.

Yet the market is still asleep at the wheel. A company pulling in¬†**$60M in revenue**¬†should not be trading at a¬†**$15M market cap**. Even at just¬†**1x sales**, this stock would be sitting closer to¬†**$60M+ in valuation**‚Äî**a 4x from here**. The math is simple:¬†**DAVIDsTEA is undervalued, period.**

# Prime Takeover Target

Beyond the numbers,¬†**DAVIDsTEA is a well-known brand**¬†with a loyal following and a streamlined operation post-restructuring. That makes it an¬†**ideal acquisition candidate**¬†for a larger player looking to dominate the specialty tea market.

Who could come knocking?

* **Starbucks**‚Äîlooking for a strong tea brand to complement its coffee dominance.
* **Nestl√© or Unilever**‚Äîboth actively expanding in the beverage space.
* **A private equity firm**‚Äîbuying a company this cheap and scaling it wouldn‚Äôt take much.

And the best part?¬†**With $8M in cash and no major debt, this isn‚Äôt a distressed asset‚Äîit‚Äôs a legitimate business trading at a ridiculous discount.**

# The Market Wakes Up

Some analysts already see DAVIDsTEA heading¬†**back above $1 in the near term**, especially if Q4 numbers stay strong. That‚Äôs a¬†**2x move from here**, but if a serious buyer steps in,¬†**$3-$5 per share isn‚Äôt unrealistic**.

The stock has flown under the radar while markets chase AI hype and meme stocks, but¬†**value always gets recognized eventually**. At some point, either a takeover rumor, improved earnings, or a simple re-rating of the stock could send this soaring.

# Risks? Sure, But the Setup is Strong

Yes, it‚Äôs¬†**OTC**, so liquidity isn‚Äôt great, and retail is a tough business. But¬†**DAVIDsTEA has real cash flow, solid financials, and a brand with staying power**. This isn‚Äôt a speculative biotech hoping for FDA approval‚Äîit‚Äôs a company that¬†**already generates revenue and is running leaner than ever**.

# Bottom Line

DAVIDsTEA at¬†**$0.47/share is a steal**:  
‚úÖ¬†**$15M market cap**  
‚úÖ¬†**$8M cash buffer**  
‚úÖ¬†**$60M+ sales**  
‚úÖ¬†**Takeover target potential**  
‚úÖ¬†**Profitable turnaround in progress**

This isn‚Äôt a long-shot bet‚Äîit‚Äôs¬†**a value play with serious upside**. Whether through organic growth or an acquisition,¬†**this stock looks primed for a major move**.",2,1741278831.0,pennystocks,3,0.67,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

And I got an 81.67 on my most recent interview. Ok, but not enough for an apprenticeship apparently.

And honestly, I‚Äôm not especially bummed out. I‚Äôve always heard how hard the trades are on your body.
 
And it‚Äôs a five year program. I‚Äôm essentially a permanent nomad. And I just moved back to the Midwest, to stay with a friend while I get back on my feet. So I didn‚Äôt really wanna stay here tbh for five years through six months a year of cold, grey, windy and sometimes snowy weather. While dealing with seasonal affective disorder and the deluge of other mental health issues related to a lifetime of depression, isolation, rejection, blah blah, no family, few friends, etc. 
 
But in the interim, I‚Äôm working as an assistant manager for a pizza place for $17 an hour, working 5 pm to 3-4 am five days a week.
 
It‚Äôs not good money, but it‚Äôs not the worst either. I do make some overtime too of course. And I don‚Äôt have a lot of bills while I get back on my feet. I like all my coworkers and the customers are generally ok. 
 
But I am not a night person at all whatsoever, and I don‚Äôt really wanna stay in the Midwest. Or in the food service industry.
 
So idk what to do anymore. I‚Äôve managed restaurants, coffee shops, been a bartender, a server, did remote digital organizing for a non profit, technical onboarding for a financial services firm for a few months and also with an educational org, and worked on political campaigns.
 
So I‚Äôve done a lot of varied work, and have some computer and remote experience.   

But idk where to look anymore, what to do, and how to find contentment with work. 

I ideally would like to live somewhere warm year-round, and be able to have WiFi to work from home, since I have severe agoraphobia most of the time at this point. And if I could live by nature, in a log cabin, or something like that, with my dogs, I‚Äôd be as close to content as I could be.

I‚Äôm 16 months into TTC, and let‚Äôs just say‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve found some very creative ways to cope. It all started with baby clothes (because, obviously, if I buy them, the baby has to come, right?). That hasn‚Äôt stopped - my latest buy is from the M&S baby collection, and the tiny croissant and babyccino outfits were an absolute must.

Then, about three months in, Lego became my new hyperfixation. It started with the Orchid, which felt like a nice, relaxing build‚Ä¶ then I somehow escalated straight to the Disney Castle (4,837 pieces) because go big or go home, right? From there, I went through the Botanical Garden, Hokusai ‚Äì The Great Wave, Pac-Man Arcade, and most recently, Mario and Yoshi, which is still sitting in Christmas wrapping paper because I haven‚Äôt gotten around to opening it yet. There are many more Lego sets, but honestly, the list is too long. At this point, you‚Äôd think we had shares in Lego.

Then came Sylvanian Families, followed by a phase of buying random massive teddies - like a giant lamb plush that‚Äôs bigger than a two-year-old and a huge Build-A-Bear Cinnamoroll that is currently stuffed in my wardrobe because I have no space for it. There was also a short stint with Labubu, because it‚Äôs kind of ugly but also‚Ä¶ weirdly cute?

Then came Sonny Angels. I became obsessed with Hippers (because clipping tiny figures to things is an underrated joy) and even started bejewelling them for extra sparkle. That obsession lasted a while‚Ä¶ and then, somehow, I fell into the world of Jellycats.

At first, I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan, but one day, we went to Harrods to try and get the limited Vicky Teapot & Seb Teacup - but, of course, they were completely sold out. So instead, I left with a Pain au Chocolat and an Espresso Cup, because if I couldn‚Äôt have the fancy tea set, I was at least going to leave with a little afternoon tea setup. Plush pastries and coffee felt like the next best thing. Then, after a particularly tough fertility clinic visit, my partner surprised me with Timmy Turtle‚Ä¶ and I guess I‚Äôve been obsessed ever since. Now, I‚Äôve gone all in - I just ordered the entire Pretty Patisserie Jellycat range and the Amuseables Croissant, because obviously, my future baby will need the full French pastry collection to play with. And let‚Äôs be honest, the croissant Jellycat was made to go with the M&S croissant outfit.

Oh, and Selfridges had a new Jellycat collection launching, and I spent all of Monday refreshing their website trying to get my hands on it. By Tuesday, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and had to go straight after work to grab the Bashful Beige Bunny Birthday because I had to have it. And, of course, I also picked up a Fergus Frog so my partner doesn‚Äôt feel left out - because nothing says love like a plush frog.

And to top it all off, the new Sonny Angels Cherry Blossom series dropped today‚Ä¶ so naturally, I bought the whole collection. My partner doesn‚Äôt know yet, but I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll find out when another package from Japan turns up at the door.

At this point, my home looks like a whimsical toy store, and I regret nothing.

Does anyone else have a totally random or slightly unhinged coping mechanism while TTC? Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this!",7,1741278346.0,TryingForABaby,13,0.77,False

(Simple background story of us)

We both know each other way back since 2012 we are both high school that time but our relationship started senior year ng pre med niya sa la salle dasma (Lintik na NMAT kasi yan papa tutor pa kasi sakin, that's how we start our development)

Super colorful ng relationship namin that time. When she started in med school she even choose to live with me sa Isabelle kasi super convenient niya sa school niya and di siya familiar sa Manila kasi galing nga siya Cavite. I work and work and work most of the time and she flood herself with her trans or slides every night. Our date are always review date on different coffee shop na makita niya online pero syempre most of the time petron nlex OG hahaha. Ganun naging cycle namin I continue providing for our relationship and her luho hindi dahil ako yung guy pero kasi mapride ako and ayoko ng nililibre niya ko kasi allowance pa yung ipapanlibre niya although todo kilig rin ako everytime na may surprise siya sakin like simple shoppee parcel hahaha. I love spoiling her iba yung tama nang sobrang burn out niya sa pag aaral and then there's me everytime I spoil her napapawi yung pagod niya at napapalitan ng ngiti.

Anyway naiinis lang ako kasi buhos yung emotion ko like naghihintay nalang ako matapos yung clerkship niya to ask her to marry me imagine as in na settle ko na lahat the ring, the bank accounts, the property where we gonna live (gift from my parents) kaso di ko maintindihan bakit bigla bigla kayo magiging cold and mang iiwan sa ere. We never cheated to each other. Minsan napapa isip nalang ako na sana cheating issue nalang para madali mag move on kaso hindi i rereason out niyo kasi di pa kayo ready like gusto niyo PLE passer muna. Sana pinaliwanag muna, pinag usapan para maintindihan kasi iintindihin naman eh. Nakakainis kayo. 1year kayo nag clerkship inintindi yun, yung sobrang busy niyo, yung kawalan niyo ng time, yung bigla bigla kayo magagalit kasi sobrang puyat at pagod na kayo. Tapos after clerkship niyo iiwan niyo. Nakakainis kamo kayo talaga.",3,1741278193.0,medschoolph,0,0.67,False

Before the machine, I wasn‚Äôt much of a coffee lover. The odd latte here and there was about as much as I bothered with. In the process of setting up and configuring the machine I tried many cups of golden goodness and became hooked.¬†

Over the next few years I used the machine religiously whilst trying to care for it properly, frequently emptying the drip tray and grounds, as well as running the suggested cleaning and descaling cycles whenever recommended. Although the coffee continued to taste great I noticed over time my bowels did bot seem to enjoy the golden goodness as much as my tastebuds. I eventually replaced the brewing unit and gave the parts of the machine I had immediate access to another full clean but it didn‚Äôt help.

This week, after watching some guides on YouTube, I decided to have a go at disassembling the machine to have a go at cleaning the insides. I stripped it back to the grinder and was pretty horrified by how dirty it was inside. Various bits were visibly mouldy and it was clear that none of the automated cleaning cycles really properly clean the immediate areas between the coffee grinder and the brewing unit. I‚Äôve decided to retire the machine and so I‚Äôm now in the market for something new.

I really enjoy the convenience of a full BTC machine, but I‚Äôm worried about buying another machine that‚Äôs prohibitive to keep clean. I would imagine most BTC machines suffer from this due to the nature of the beast. I was wondering what other people‚Äôs experiences were when it comes to deep cleaning these machines? Are some models easier to keep clean than others? Should I look at semi automatics instead if cleanliness is my concern?",0,1741278137.0,superautomatic,1,0.5,False

Based in the UK. Currently developing power apps for the company I work for. This is not part of my current role and I‚Äôve been doing it in my free time, or as overtime. 

Bit about me: I‚Äôve been working in IT support for over 10 years and I‚Äôve kind of taken it as far as I can go, unless I want to move up into management. Which I don‚Äôt. Currently earning ¬£39k. I started learning to develop power apps and power automate flows a couple of years ago to help out with some of our day to day tasks around the office. This seems to have snowballed and I now have requests coming in to develop more apps across the business globally. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty good with coding and designing the apps, but I‚Äôm maybe a bit behind in terms of understanding environments, solutions and licensing. Completed the PL-200 course, but didn‚Äôt do the exam. 


I had to demo my most recent app on a call for around 500 people and it went really well. Afterwards, I was approached by a manager within my office who asked me if I‚Äôd be interested in a full time role developing power apps. Her husbands company are currently recruiting developers and he‚Äôs keen to have a chat with me over a coffee. 

The initial plan was for my current employer to turn this into a full time role for me, but as more time passes, I‚Äôm starting to think that it‚Äôs never gonna happen, nor would the salary be what I‚Äôm looking for. So I‚Äôm going to send my CV off to this other company and go meet the guy for a coffee. 

Now you know a little bit about me, what sort of salary do you think I‚Äôd be looking at? 

TLDR: 10 years in IT support, 2 years in power platform. What sort of salary can I expect?
