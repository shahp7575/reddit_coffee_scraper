by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Oregon Ducks vs. Indiana Hoosiers: A Top-10 Showdown Where Math Meets Mayhem**

The No. 3 Oregon Ducks, hosts of Autzen Stadium‚Äôs ‚ÄúMost Comfortable Couch for Playoff Dreams,‚Äù face the No. 7 Indiana Hoosiers in a clash so high-stakes, even the College GameDay crew packed their own oxygen tanks. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a QB‚Äôs spiral and the humor of a punter‚Äôs postgame interview.

---

### Parsing the Odds: When Numbers Speak Louder Than Coaches‚Äô Press Conferences

The odds tell a clear story: Oregon is the favorite, with implied probabilities of **\~71%** (based on -550 DraftKings odds) to win, while Indiana checks in at **\~29%**. The spread? Oregon -7.5, which feels less like a football game and more like a math test where the Ducks are allowed to use a calculator. The over/under of 55.5 points suggests this could be a popcorn-friendly shootout‚Äîperfect for fans who prefer their touchdowns served with a side of chili.

Statistically, Oregon‚Äôs offense (led by Dante Moore, ESPN‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest QB in College Football‚Äù according to Josh Pate‚Äôs morning coffee-induced revelation) has the Hoosiers‚Äô defense circling like a vulture at a picnic. But Indiana‚Äôs defense, ranked **2nd in tackles for loss** and **8th in sacks**, isn‚Äôt exactly a pushover. They‚Äôve got Tyrique Tucker, a human sack machine, and D‚ÄôAngelo Ponds, a cornerback who missed a game but returned like a ‚ÄúWelcome Back, Kotter‚Äù episode of elite defense.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Strengths, and Why Shoelaces Matter

Let‚Äôs start with the Hoosiers. Fernando Mendoza, Indiana‚Äôs QB, is a magician with a football‚Äîexcept his rabbit is a 6-foot-2, 229-pound wide receiver named Elijah Sarratt, who catches passes like he‚Äôs been paid by the yard. Roman Hemby, the Hoosiers‚Äô RB, isn‚Äôt breaking the speed record for the 100-meter dash, but he‚Äôs a freight train in a slow lane, churning out 351 yards so far. The only downside? Indiana‚Äôs offense occasionally forgets how to run the ball, which is like a chef forgetting to add salt‚Äîconfusing, underwhelming, and best served with an apology.

Oregon? Their defense is about a

I am new to reddit and the Gerd community as I have been so sick, doctors couldn't seem to help (surprise surprise), and just now finally feel well enough to join for extra guidance/help, and also my own advice.
It started back this May. Feelings of fullness, forced burping, trouble breathing, back pain, neck tightness, nausea (but not enough to throw up and actually feel better) and of course the star of the show ‚ú®panic attacks‚ú®

I woke up one morning and just really felt like I should throw up so I forced myself to hoping for some releif like the good ol' days. To my surprise I was met by a coffee ground looking substance that tasted like - you guessed it - blood...

Of course I thought I had the big C, and was generally in a state of panic and terrified to go to the hospital. Until I threw blood all night and my chest was burning so bad I finally got an endoscopy done and they saw that my LES was inflamed. Just in case I got an mri done everywhere and they found nothing (like thank GOD but also what the heck is the problem then?) 

I was given ppis and they sucked. The anxiety and feeling trapped in my body with them was...an experience... to say the least. 
H2 blockers helped but then didnt, just made me feel sleepy. 

If there is any other possible diagnosis please let me know, but this is the only official diagnosis I got. I have struggled with feelings of fullness + headache in the past and have taken nsaid's for a long time. 

I have now tried around 30 different supplements to see what worked and have found some that seem to help, but in terms of everday funtioning (can't seem to focus) I am seeking more improvement.

My next post will be about what helped and what didn't (its a long list)... so stay tuned if you want to cut the bs haha...

Until next time...

It started off as laziness I will admit like oh I can just order and it will come to my house how convenient! And now a couple of years in, I fear I do not know how to combat these apps. Theres this one app with super cheap stuff that I just log into to look at because it had all these cool little trinkets that aren't available in my country and so I would need to order them if I wanted them,but like a crow I do fear I am just accumulating stuff for no reason. But man the happiness surge I get by looking at all of these things is unreal. My friends say I have a problem with this specific app the most. I have tried deleting it. I just install it back again. Tried scrolling through it unlogged. Just log back in. Deleted the card off of it. Just go thru the hassle of putting the card details back in. I have it on a 10 minute timer now so i get kicked out of the app. I kid you not managed to fill out a whole cart and was just about to click pay when the timer tossed me out. I dont even actually buy any of this stuff. Like ill buy one or two things. But usually i just buy it. Refund it immediately. Then go buy more stuff. Buy it. Refund it immediately. It's a little weird. Sometimes I will actually buy stuff and then they'll arrive and I'll be sad because ew this actually sucks it came dented and really poor quality (like gee, the price should‚Äôve alerted me of that anyway) so I'll complain to the app and get a partial refund or such. So again?? Not actually that big of a problen money wise. But if i didn't go through these hoops with my banks to refund I do think I would be spending way too much money on this. I would like to stop. I really would. Have no idea how.

Then I have this makeup app too that's local and there is a store in my hometown but I just like using the app because it looks like a videogame and I get to look at all the discounts. There is a points system involved and if you accumulate a certain number of points u get to use them and get a discount, which again, making my head go wild. Sometimes I'll just order something and then immediatelly email them to cancel the order but they haven't figured out how to cancel the points so I can gain them this way. There's a pharmacy in the hometown store so I mainly use the discount via the points on medicine when I need to stock up. But really it isn't even that big of a discount. I am making money. Like i have a salary. Why am I doing this? Why not just buy medicine when I need it and not go through the hassle of these apps? Not to mention I live in constant state of small anxiety waiting for the delivery guys to call me with my orders and yet what if I can't get out of work to pick them up, oh no, i can't go to the beach, i can't go have coffee with my friends because I'm *waiting*. I mean I do. But the calls do be giving me anxiety. Also i need to have cash on me at all times because here we tend to pay deliveries in cash.

Ampigo (A play on 'Amp' + 'Go')

I‚Äôm more of an introvert, and social situations can feel a bit intimidating sometimes. But that shouldn‚Äôt mean we miss out on genuine connections, right?¬†

The problem is, most social platforms like Meetup and even big, crowded events feel intimidating, overwhelming, or just not built for people like us. That‚Äôs what got me thinking. The problem isn‚Äôt that we don‚Äôt want to meet people; it‚Äôs how we meet them. What we actually need is a more relaxed, low-pressure way to connect, something that makes it easy to meet people nearby who actually share our interests.¬†

That‚Äôs how the idea for Bunchups came about:¬†an app to make meeting new people feel natural, less intimidating, and safe. Bunchups is all about one-on-one or small group catchups built around shared interests.¬†

**We‚Äôve built the platform. Now we need your help to bring it to life.**¬†

For Bunchups to really take off, we need a handful of amazing people: the first 10, 20, maybe 30, to step up and plan an activity. It doesn‚Äôt have to be anything big. Something as simple as:

* Anyone up for a coffee this weekend?¬†
* Looking for someone to play tennis with¬†
* Looking for a gym buddy¬†
* Let's walk along Eastern Beach¬†

That initial wave of activities¬†is what will inspire others to join in, explore the app, and start planning their own. Your activity could be the reason someone finally steps out, meets new people, and gets back to doing the things they really enjoy.¬†

So if you‚Äôve ever thought, ‚ÄúI wish there was a better way to meet people,‚Äù this is your chance to be part of the solution.¬†

My best friend Lily suggested that I share an apartment with her brother jake. Jake and I didn't know eachother very much but I remember him from my play dates with Lily at her mother's place. I agreed to stay with Jake cause I didn't have any other options. Fast forward to next week I was at Jake's apartment figuring out how to organise my stuff in this tiny room jake let me use. Jake wasn't a sweet person at all rather rude and ruthless. I didn't make it much of a deal at first. I worked at a small coffee shop downtown and Jake had a stable well paying job. He covered most of our shared rent so I wasn't going to complain. 
Once I was working double shifts to cover rent and groceries and came home exhausted and saw the apartment full of people I didn't recognise. I thought Jake was having a party as it was friday night. I walk past those people towards my room and boom üí•. People were making our in my room and it was cluttered like a tornado just clased mins ago. I was furious but I didn't confront jake right away I walked out of the apartment and spent the rest of the night at a friends place. Next day I went home and found Jake crashed on the couch looking exhausted.
I went up to him and said 'We need to talk.' 'What is it?' he said grudgingly.'It is totally fine for you to invite guests. But, yesterday when I came back from work I found my room cluttered like crazy and people making out in my bed. Jake I felt so much uncomfortable in that situation. I want you to respect my privacy. Now help me reorganise my room.' 'Fuck off young lady I don't care about your comfort and privacy this is my apartment I can do whatever I want.' I was furious after hearing that. We started to argue. And the conversation became so heated I pushed him. And that my friend might be something that I shouldn't have done.
Next few minutes were like a scene from a romantic movie.
He pulled me closer and held me tightly by my waist. I could feel every single breath of him on my face. I could smell his madning perfume. For a moment I thought I am levitating. This move of his wanted me to forget I was mad at him. ' What happened young lady? Blushing huh! Do you have a crush on me?' I was left strateled by his question. I mumbled something about not liking him. He then let go of me. ' Go to your room it's cluttered already.' 
I didn't talk to him for an entire week. One fine day he asked me on a date with him and I said yes. And this is how I met my husband.

**In 2014, a Texas mother claimed to glimpse a towering, skin-suited figure silently crossing her kitchen, an entity she believed was cloaked, invisible, and frighteningly aware of her family. What followed were months of terror, strange metallic ‚Äúballoons,‚Äù and the haunting sense that something inhuman had claimed their home.**



""Hi, Lon. The location and date were Lubbock, Texas, on May 22, 2014. I was sitting in a dark room, looking out into the kitchen area. It was early morning when I suddenly saw something very tall and white move across the kitchen, almost as if it were strolling through the house, as if it owned the place. It passed by the door, so I didn‚Äôt get a good look, but I knew immediately that it wasn‚Äôt human. I froze, scared to death. My husband and my young daughter were in the living room, just about 10 steps away from this creature. It was invisible. Not only was it invisible, but you couldn‚Äôt hear it moving around, which would have been impossible without some help. The creature was at least a little over 6 feet tall, if not taller, because my first thought when it went by was to convince myself it was my husband walking into the kitchen. It was a comforting thought, but when I finally mustered the nerve to get up and walk, I realized I was right.



The only reason I know it was invisible is that it had been here before. You could almost feel that it knew the house and us better than anything, which is very disturbing. From the quick glimpse I barely caught, the creature didn‚Äôt seem to have an ounce of fat on its body; it looked powerful and muscular, yet thin and lithe. Its body appeared to be covered by some suit that looked like pale skin. I believe it didn‚Äôt know I saw it, and I strongly suspect that the only reason I was able to see it was due to the way the light was shining in the house. The various windows, the time of day, and the sudden reflections all contributed to my ability to see through the cloak it was using. It was headed toward the window, as if to look outside. I had the sense that it was bored and waiting for something to happen.



As for my feelings, I was terrified. I can‚Äôt express how, for the first two months, I screamed in the car and cried. I had the sense that if or when this being, or these beings, wanted to kill us, there was nothing we could do. No gun, no knife, no bomb, no weapon could help; they were faster, stronger, and wiser. I felt like we were cattle to be harvested for food later, and as a mother, I experienced a horrible sense of hopelessness. I had never felt such hopelessness in my life. There was nowhere to go, nowhere to hide, nothing, nothing we could do. I despised that feeling. When it happened, I swallowed my pride, walked into the kitchen, even though I knew that being was around, got some coffee, and ventured into the living room. I looked at my husband and daughter, told them I loved them, and turned on the TV.



I attempted to contact a scientist shortly after the incident occurred. I even got out a measuring tape and took measurements, thinking that maybe the measurements would help some scientist figure out how to cloak or break cloaks or invisible technology. I remember labeling my email ""Code Black"" in hopes of grabbing his attention, but I didn‚Äôt get a response. I ended up erasing my message, feeling like there was no one else I could turn to.



I have not told anyone, not even my husband. I can‚Äôt. I feel that if I utter the words out loud, whoever I tell will die. The weight of this feeling is utterly powerful, horrifically so, at least at first. After about a month, two more strange occurrences occurred. I never saw the creature again, but I did spot, on two separate occasions, silver balloon-like objects in the bedroom.



The main one I remember was when I woke up, as I always do, around 3:30 a.m. I thought I heard something. Still worried about being slaughtered like cattle for food or killed, I remained still and glanced around the room, not wanting anything to know I was awake yet. I could feel myself sweating, and I had to remind myself to take slow, steady breaths to appear as if I were still asleep. Suddenly, I heard something sliding against the ceiling of the room. My heart was pounding, and I could listen to the steady breathing of my husband next to me, sound asleep. The ceiling fan was still running, and I had the covers pulled up around me. The sliding sound was approaching me, and then I caught sight of a silver balloon sliding across the ceiling with its tail hanging down. I almost laughed out loud. I watched it slide around the room slowly, thinking how annoying it was, and I was relieved it was just a balloon. I closed my eyes, laughing at myself for being so silly and paranoid.



Suddenly, my heart stopped. My daughter doesn‚Äôt have a balloon; she hasn‚Äôt had one in months, and never a silver one. This one looked metallic, though it was hard to perceive in the darkness. My eyes flew open, and yes, it was still there. I could still hear it sliding against the ceiling as its tail hung down. ‚ÄúMake it a balloon, make it a balloon. It‚Äôs your kid‚Äôs balloon,‚Äù I wanted to believe it so badly! I wanted to cry and scream. I stayed very still, reminding myself, ‚ÄúBreathe normally, don‚Äôt move, don‚Äôt open your eyes too wide, don‚Äôt freak out, don‚Äôt let it know you‚Äôre awake. I've been warned."" G

1o1zllr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingSecrets101/comments/1o1zllr/why_your_networking_events_are_often_a_waste_of/,Why Your 'Networking Events' Are Often a Waste of Time (My Strategy That Actually Works),"You know, it's quite interesting to think about networking. While a strong 80% of professionals believe it's super important for their career success, a surprisingly low 38% actually find traditional networking events effective (Statista 2022). That's a huge gap, isn't it? Sitting here with my chai, observing how people truly connect, I've realized that the best business results rarely come from forced conversations over lukewarm coffee at formal events.

Many of us can relate to the awkwardness at formal mixers. Everyone's got an elevator pitch ready, trying to 'sell' something, and it often feels transactional. Simon Sinek, the author and motivational speaker, wisely points out, ‚ÄúTrue connection happens when you are authentic and vulnerable. That's hard to do in a ballroom full of strangers trying to sell something.‚Äù This transactional mindset is why those efforts often fall flat. Instead, the real magic begins when you focus on genuine relationship building. Keith Ferrazzi, author of 'Never Eat Alone', puts it beautifully: ‚ÄúThe currency of real networking is not greed but generosity.‚Äù It's about giving value first, without expecting an immediate return. Porter Gale also reminds us, ‚ÄúYour network is your net worth, but only if you actually *engage* with your network in meaningful ways‚Äù (Your Network Is Your Net Worth 2013).

The world of work has also shifted dramatically with remote and hybrid models, pushing more interactions online (McKinsey & Company 2023). This has fueled 'asynchronous networking' (connecting through online communities or direct messages without real-time pressure), a trend Forbes highlighted in 2023. This approach truly works because warm referrals, which come from these deeper, non-traditional connections, boast a 30-50% higher conversion rate for sales leads or job applications compared to cold outreach (HubSpot 2023). Plus, companies with highly networked employees even report 7% higher revenue growth (Deloitte 2022).

Here in India, this 'non-traditional' approach often feels very natural. Our 'jaan-pehchaan' culture, where personal relationships and informal networks ('jugaad' connections) hold more weight, aligns perfectly with building trust over time. While formal events offer a concentrated way to meet many people quickly, they often come with a time commitment of 2-4 hours with low perceived return, contrasting with these higher-quality interactions.

So, the real 'hack' isn't always about avoiding events, but about changing *how* we engage. It‚Äôs about being genuinely interested in others, offering help first, and building trust slowly, whether online or offline. It‚Äôs about quality over quantity, always. What has been your most effective, maybe even surprising, networking experience? Did it happen at a formal event, or somewhere completely unexpected?

As a franchise expert, I get asked this a lot: Is investing in a coffee franchise really a smart move?

Here‚Äôs the scoop from what I‚Äôve seen:

What‚Äôs good about it:  
Coffee is a daily habit for many people. If your location is good, you‚Äôll get repeat customers.  
Franchises usually come with training, established suppliers, and brand recognition; those things take a ton off your plate.  
You don‚Äôt have to invent everything from scratch: systems, menus, operations, etc., are mostly built for you.

What to watch out for:  
Costs can add up, rent, staff, equipment, branding, and franchisor fees.  
Your profit margin depends heavily on location, pricing, and how efficiently you are with managing waste, inventory, staff.  
You might have less creativity/flexibility, since you‚Äôll be following the franchisor‚Äôs rules.

Coffee is a daily habit for many people. If your location is good, you‚Äôll get repeat customers.  
Franchises usually come with training, established suppliers, and brand recognition; those things take a ton off your plate.  
You don‚Äôt have to invent everything from scratch: systems, menus, operations, etc., are mostly built for you.

What to watch out for:  
Costs can add up, rent, staff, equipment, branding, and franchisor fees.  
 Your profit margin depends heavily on location, pricing, and how efficiently you are with managing waste, inventory, staff.  
You might have less creativity/flexibility, since you‚Äôll be following the franchisor‚Äôs rules.

If you‚Äôre researching this, this is a great resource to explore dos and don‚Äôts of coffee shop franchises: [https://www.franchisecoach.net/coffee-shop-franchise/](https://www.franchisecoach.net/coffee-shop-franchise/)

Would love to hear from people who‚Äôve run or considered a coffee franchise. What was your experience or concern?

If you need a little reset without going full ‚Äúcleanse mode,‚Äù you might be thinking to try [**Traditional Medicinals Everyday Detox Lemon Tea**](https://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/everydaydetoxtea.php).

Based on my first-hand experience with various detox and weight loss teas, I'd like to share my thoughts on Everyday Detox Lemon Tea. I've tried numerous teas marketed for weight loss and detox effects, and this one falls somewhere in the middle range.

**Rating: 3/5 stars**

**What I Appreciate:** If you're looking for a gentle, caffeine-free option, this tea is worth considering. Unlike some of the aggressive ""skinny teas"" that can have you running to the bathroom (***like those Chinese slimming teas many users warn about)***, *Traditional Medicinals* takes a more moderate approach. I found the lemon flavor pleasant and not artificial.

**The Downsides:** If you're expecting dramatic weight loss results, you might be disappointed. From my experience, and comparing with feedback from other tea users, any weight loss effects are minimal at best. Like most detox teas, any initial weight loss is likely just water weight.

**Comparison with Other Brands:** Having tried various options, I'd say this is gentler than those intense Chinese slimming teas that many users report cause severe digestive issues.

However, it's not as satisfying as a good quality green tea or detoxing as other good dandelion brands from some reputable vendors [**like this brand**](https://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) **(this one is my current top pick for weight management and detox)** or Den's Tea or Harney & Sons, which offer better overall benefits.

¬†

**Checkout this article on full list of top recommended detox teas-**

[**https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/best-detox-tea-drinks-expert-tested-recommendations/**](https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/best-detox-tea-drinks-expert-tested-recommendations/)

¬†

**My Honest Take:** If you're interested in Everyday detox tea, here's what you should know:

* The dandelion root can have a mild diuretic effect, but nothing as dramatic as some ""detox"" teas
* It's more expensive than basic grocery store teas but cheaper than premium loose leaf options
* The lemon flavor helps mask some of the herbal bitterness
* Don't expect miracle results - it's best used as part of a balanced diet and exercise routine

**Safety Notes:** From my experience with various detox teas, I appreciate that this one doesn't contain harsh laxatives like senna, which can be found in many ""slimming"" teas. However, if you have a sensitive stomach, start with just one cup to see how your body reacts.

¬†

**Bottom Line:** I'd recommend this if you're looking for a gentle, caffeine-free evening tea that might help with bloating. However, if your primary goal is weight loss, you might be better off investing in quality green tea and focusing on diet and exercise.

Remember, as many experienced tea drinkers in the community note, there's no magic tea that will dramatically affect your weight - it's more about replacing high-calorie beverages, appetite and cravings control support and developing healthy habits.

Keep in mind that my experience is just one perspective - everyone's body reacts differently to these products. If you decide to try it, start slowly and listen to your body's response.



# What I currently recommend

Based on my extensive experience with various weight loss teas, I would highly recommend trying [**this tea brand**](https://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) over Traditional Medicinals if you're serious about supporting your weight management goals.

This tea system really stands out because it's designed as a complete day-night solution - you get an energizing morning blend that contains metabolism-boosting ingredients like *green tea, oolong, and garcinia cambogia* (something Traditional Medicinals lacks), plus a ***gentle evening detox blend*** that helps with bloating and digestion.

What I particularly appreciate is that while Traditional Medicinals offers just basic herbal support, the former combines proven ingredients like green tea for metabolism, ginger for digestion, and monk fruit for natural sweetness without calories.

If you struggle with late-night cravings, their evening blend has been especially helpful in my experience, offering benefits beyond what the basic detox effect of Traditional Medicinals delivers.

In my opinion, the dual-blend approach helps maintain consistent energy throughout the day while supporting better sleep at night - a crucial factor for weight management that the Traditional Medicinals blend doesn't address.

Unlike some harsh detox teas, this one provides a more balanced approach that you can sustainably incorporate into your daily routine.

Though I still maintain that no tea alone will cause dramatic weight loss, the comprehensive ingredient profile is a more practical choice for supporting your overall wellness and weight management goals.

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The first thing you‚Äôll notice is its **bright, lemony aroma** when you brew it. It‚Äôs refreshing, clean, and almost calming just to smell.

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The taste is **smooth, slightly citrusy**, and balanced. You‚Äôll get **subtle herbal notes** from the dandelion root and burdock, but they don‚Äôt overpower the tea.

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† There‚Äôs no weird aftertaste, and because it‚Äôs **caffeine-free**, you can drink it day or night without messing with your sleep.

If you want to get the most out of **Traditional Medicinals Everyday Detox Tea**, here‚Äôs the best way to incorporate it into your day.

# ¬†

# My final Performance Evaluation (Ratings) of EveryDay Detox tea



# Appetite Control: 3/5

While not specifically designed to curb appetite, the tea can help reduce cravings and overeating by **promoting better digestion** and reducing bloating. Its warmth and soothing qualities may help you feel satiated between meals.

# Energy Enhancement: 2.5/5

Since it‚Äôs **caffeine-free**, this tea doesn‚Äôt provide a direct energy boost like coffee or green tea. However, its ability to improve liver function and digestion may result in a **subtle increase in energy levels** over time as toxins are flushed out and your body operates more efficiently.

# Metabolism Boosting: 3/5

Ingredients like **dandelion root** and **burdock root** may indirectly support metabolism by enhancing liver health and detoxification. While not a metabolism ‚Äúbooster‚Äù in the traditional sense, it creates an internal environment conducive to better metabolic function.

# Fat Oxidation and Burning: 2/5

This tea isn‚Äôt specifically formulated for fat burning, and there‚Äôs little evidence that its ingredients directly oxidize fat. However, by reducing bloating and improving digestion, it may support a feeling of lightness that helps motivate healthier habits.

# Blood Sugar Regulation: 3/5

**Dandelion root** and **stinging nettle** have been traditionally linked to better blood sugar control. While not a substitute for medical treatment, the tea may help balance blood sugar levels mildly by promoting improved digestion and reducing sugar cravings.

# Cognitive Support and Mental Clarity: 2.5/5

The tea‚Äôs natural detox benefits may support **mental clarity** over time as the body removes excess toxins. However, it doesn‚Äôt contain specific cognitive enhancers like adaptogens or nootropics, so its effect here is minimal.

# Digestive and Gut Health: 4.5/5

This is where the tea shines. **Dandelion root** acts as a natural liver and digestive tonic, while **burdock root** and **stinging nettle** help with bloating, water retention, and gut health. Many users report feeling less bloated and more regular after drinking it consistently.

# Safety and Tolerability: 5/5

The tea is **organic, caffeine-free**, and made with well-studied herbs that are generally safe for most people. It‚Äôs gentle on the stomach and has a very low risk of side effects when consumed in moderation.

# Long-Term Effectiveness: 4/5

For ongoing liver support, skin health, and detoxification, this tea works well when consumed regularly. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúquick fix,‚Äù but with long-term use, users tend to notice sustained improvements in digestion, bloating, and general wellness.

Many caf√©s now offer reusable buckets for a deposit, so you can bring the bucket back and stay eco-friendly. On social media, these huge coffee buckets are popping up in half the reels and TikToks out of Dubai. 

Would you try a bucket of coffee? Is it just hype, or actually awesome?

This release brings some massive upgrades to iOS that make reading, searching, and multitasking a lot better. On Android, organizing bookmarks gets easier with a new button for creating folders on the fly, plus a round of stability and performance fixes.

https://preview.redd.it/tszmme5ua1uf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbf5cf59b51b4637261e8b7e96a7b59bd54a580b

If you like your browser fast, flexible, and a bit Norwegian in spirit, this update is for you.

# What‚Äôs new in Vivaldi 7.6 for iOS

# Reader View, for when the content needs focus

The web can be a noisy place. Reader View turns the volume down so you can, well, read. One tap gives you a clean page with typography that actually respects your eyes. Pick a look that suits the moment, then settle in with your coffee.

https://preview.redd.it/k6r4vevva1uf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=cac009b5e7ff558065f1a3827f1b533a73d63510

You control the experience. Choose a theme that fits the light around you, nudge brightness to tame glare, select a font that feels natural, and bump the size until the words sit comfortably. Vivaldi remembers your choices, so the next article opens exactly the way you like it. Late-night news, long reports, recipe binges, research rabbit holes are¬† all easier to finish without pop-ups and chrome stealing your attention.

How to use it: open an article and tap the Reader icon in the Address Bar. Adjust theme, brightness, font, and size in the panel. Done. Your browser, your rules.

What you can tweak:  
‚Ä¢ Themes: light, dark, sepia, or high-contrast black  
‚Ä¢ Brightness: a simple slider for comfort at any hour  
‚Ä¢ Typography: Sans Serif, Serif, or Monospace  
‚Ä¢ Text size: quick minus and plus controls

# Add your own search engines

We like choice. You should be able to search where you want, not only where someone else wants you to. In Vivaldi 7.6 you can add custom search engines on iOS, give them friendly names, and make the one you love your default. Power users can even add short nicknames to keep things quick.

https://preview.redd.it/t8gi87vwa1uf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=826ab8fdb55362350c8f78c3ecc80a249734198d

This is perfect for people who live in specialist sources: historians who search archives, developers who jump straight to documentation, music nerds who live in Bandcamp, or simply those who prefer niche engines. Add the engine once, then switch in a tap whenever your task changes.

How to add one: Settings ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Add Search Engine. Enter the name and the search URL, using¬†**%s**¬†where the search term usually goes. For Wikipedia, for example, you‚Äôd add:

[`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s)

# A clearer Tab Stack pane in the Tab Switcher

Stacks are how you keep related pages together without drowning in thumbnails. In 7.6 the Tab Switcher gets a dedicated pane for Tab Stacks, which means a calmer overview and faster moves. Open the Switcher and you will see your Stacks presented as tidy cards. Tap a Stack to view everything inside at a glance, then jump straight to the tab you need.

https://preview.redd.it/x2zm5exxa1uf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=05251489bd0763e30ffd9f3234baf0cbdc614bdd

How to create stacks fast:

* Long-press a link and choose¬†**Open in New Tab Stack** 
* In the Tab Switcher, group related tabs into a new stack

# Peek before you open with link previews

We have all played the game of mystery meat links. Not anymore. Long-press any link to see a live preview of the page. You can judge if it is the right thing before you commit, which saves time and a fair bit of scrolling.

https://preview.redd.it/bu09mavya1uf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c677ab23ce4bf9ad5175b17ef5f71033a30142f6

The preview sits above a compact action menu. Open in a new tab if it is a keeper, open in the background if you are on a roll, open in a new tab stack if it belongs with your current project, or open in private if it is something discreet. Fewer dead ends, more momentum.

# What‚Äôs new in Vivaldi 7.6 for Android

# Create bookmark folders instantly

Saving links is easy. Finding them later should be just as easy. In 7.6 you can create a new folder right from the save dialog, which means your bookmarks land in the right place on the first try. Fewer piles, more playlists.

https://preview.redd.it/yy3bp1f0b1uf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fb6e89fca531d78bd3767986c9a93cbfd60acad

How it works:

1. Tap the bookmark icon when you want to save a page
2. Tap¬†**New Bookmark Folder** 
3. Name the folder and choose where it lives
4. Save and carry on browsing

# Stability and bug fixes that make every tap feel better

We also spent time under the hood so Vivaldi feels steadier and quicker across more devices. Small improvements add up to a smoother day.

Highlights include:

* Fixes for rare crashes when switching or closing multiple tabs in quick succession
* Smoother scrolling on very long pages and social media feeds
* More reliable Sync with large bookmark collections
* Reduced background battery use during extended reading sessions
* UI polish for dark mode and tablet layouts

This release is another thoughtful step toward a browser that serves you. On iOS you get calmer pages with Reader View, your own engines for search, stacks that act like tidy workspaces, and previews that cut the noise. On Android you can file bookmarks the moment they are born, on a build that feels steadier every tap.  
  
As always, thank you for being part of the Vivaldi community. Together, we‚Äôre fighting for a better web, one release at a time.

Hi all.  
There was a ""news article"" that popped up in the suggested feed feature thing on the google app on my phone, stating that there are going to be new road rules effective as of Oct 2025.  
They are apparently a crackdown on Distracted driving, including absolutely NO drinking while driving (Not just alcohol, but apparently coffee, water, fizzy drinks etc) as well as absolutely NO smoking or vaping, NO eating or any other activity that would involve taking your hand off the wheel for any reason.  
I have spent the better part of an hour trying to look into if this is actually true, if it's on any government page or anything but can only find the same 3 random blog posts on websites FULL of advertisements.  
So I wanted to know if there is any legitimacy to these claims? Or if anyone actually knows about it??  
Asking before I apparently get fined from drinking from my water bottle.

edit: reworded where i got the information from. Originally I stated that I received a notification form google, but it was just a suggested ""news"" or article thing that comes up when you open the google mobile app.",10,1759993053.0,perth,52,0.75,False

I‚Äôve been building a little side project called¬†**Near Me**, a web app that helps people find great coffee shops  but lately I‚Äôve been obsessed with a sub-feature: a¬†**Coffee Profile Quiz**¬†that helps you discover your taste in coffee in just 5 questions.

At first, I thought this would be simple. Ask a few questions like¬†*‚ÄúDo you prefer sweet or strong?‚Äù*¬†and boom, done.  
But I quickly learned that people describe coffee¬†*very*¬†differently. For some, ‚Äústrong‚Äù means¬†*bitter*, for others it means¬†*rich*. Even the word ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù can mean opposite things depending on who you ask.

# Fang & Cottontail, Chapter 5

\[Aloe's mind races round in circles, thinking and thinking and thinking, as she fights her flight instinct's begin to tug at her like a rope tied around her waist pulling her away as she enters the 2nd dorm lounge of the North wing of the university accommodation complex, the sorce of that unease, a dorm hall mostly populated by hounds of all variety's, many pair's of pred eyes bare down on her as she stride's into thare den, the glares most intence not from the guys but from the pack of girls loitering by the stairwell lounging on abunch of chair's & sofas that had been pulled out of the dorrm rooms nearby staring at her over thare phones\]

*""Ok Aloe, think, you're smart, you can figure this out, you're an adult, you can just talk to them like adults, explain that they need to stop reporting on this whole issue and clear up the mess they've made, it should be as simple as that i ... what's whith the glaring... i'm... I'm allowed to be here, I'm not breaking any rules, yes, the pred's & prey seem to congregate together a lot, but we're a mixed Campus, I... It's not Illegal""*

\[Nervously, she looks for someone, searching through the collective of Canids when she finally spots the Wolf she's after, sat lounging whith a copy of the offending paper of which she holds a copy of scrunched up in her own hands, she strides up whith all the authority her little stature could muster and pulls the paper down from his claw's\]

""We need to talk about this garbage. I know I shouldn't have provoked them. I thought they would back off, but now they are planning to make another one! About the fight you¬†*just*¬†had in the west side lounge, which is just making it worse, so you are going to help me put a stop to it now!""

\[unable to maintain eye contact for more than a fraction of a second, before she has to turn around and leave, every fibre of her being telling her to run from the wolf she just provoked, walking in as controlled a manner as she can, taking deep breaths, her ears fold back nervously as she turns back to check behind her\]

\[She manages to speak without stuttering or stammering\] ""Well, are you coming?""

\[Stood behind her, looking down is a mildly irritated Silver, an expression of mild irritation and weariness hanging on his face\] ""Yes... Go"" \[he gestures forward to move, his tail giving a perturbed flick as he stares, now more confused than cautious\]

\[She turns back towards the door and begins to walk quickly, flinching away from the harsh glares from the waiting, watching council of hounds\]

\[Leaving the North dorm, the two walk silently from the housing block towards one of the campus's older study buildings that had been renovated into the Exteracurricular Programs Centre, heading for the HQ of the journalism Program, ready to confront the 3 sisters\]

\[Entering the room labelled ""Ashtail HQ"", the two are met whith what might be mistaken as the burough of a mad hatter-esque bun, the walls lined whith pinboards, chalkboards & whiteboards, draught arcicals scatered across them all, webs of pictures connected whith string that would make a detective proud, as well as collections of framed articals, presumably thare more successful or infamous releases. and lastly a number of old TV's arainged on a desk in the corner, each of them tuned into a diferent news station, playing quietly the voices of reporter's overlaping eachother, sat on the floor, legs crossed on a pillow, sits one of the three sisters surrounded whith scraps of paper, a few tablets and a laptop, and pictures of the fight that happened just a few hours ago, her ears flicker hearing approaching paws\]

""Alice, did you get the statement from the rat that started the stampede? I'm almost done whith composing all the witness statement's but I want to put it first, need to make it as visceral as possible, something quotable for the subtitle""

\[Aloe's tail flicks in annoyance\] ""Wrong rabbit, Ashley, and don't bother, you're not writing about it, we don't consent to having you dramatise, and exploit our problems for sales""

\[She looks up, frowning\] ""What do you mean by We?"" \[her glance first meets Aloe, and then she slowly looks up at the figure looming behind her, her expression shifting from annoyance to ill-concealed dread, flinching as she makes eye contact whith the disgruntled Silver\]

""Eeeeeeeee!"" \[she darts to her feet and jumps behind a desk\] ""I- Wo- Wont - Wont!, be I-In-timidat-ate-ed, by that - that, you Don't scare me! H-Hound""

\[Silver grunt's in response, seemingly insulted\] ""I'm not here to intimidate you, I'm here because Al- Ms bramble asked me to be, your annoying ramblings are both irritating and wrong, but i was going to ignore your nonsence, but now your just making the situation worse, you're partly responsible for the incident you're now writing about""

\[Closing his arm's he furrows his eyebrow a little\] ""So, I'd kindly ask that you stop, if nothing else, just let the story be, and leave people to forget it, and please stop hiding behind the desk, I'm not going to hurt you""

\[Slowly she steps out from behind the desk and brushes herself off, trying to act as if it never happened\]

""Listen, ok, I'm sorry if it's annoying, but everything me and my sister's have gathered is public information, we're not breaking any laws, and to stop us would be to infringe on freedom of the press""

\[She herself takes a stance, arms crossed, head tilted slightly to the side, ears sood tall in defiance\]

""Second of all, it's all verified information, nothing about the statements is false, and we are free to speculate on that information as we like. The pictures were given to us freely by the bystanders who agreed to allow us to use them in our publication, of which!"" \[she raised a hand, making a pointing motion towards first silver and then Aloe\] ""We were taken in a communal area where photography is permitted as per campus rules""

\[Aloe begins to tap her foot impatiently\] ""So you're not going to stop, this is ridiculous, you're only making this worse for everyone involved, what if someone gets hurt, what about the damage to our reputations, how is that fair!"" \[She gives a defiant thud whith her left paw\]

""Maybe i should make an official complaint for deformation, your speculations about me being some undercover police agent is geting me staired at everywhare i go, claiming that Mr woods is some kind of drug dealer is hardly fair, let alone claiming that Mr snow here was some kind of stalker dosent even make sense, they weren't fighting over who could have me or something so stupid""

\[over the raised voices, neither of them had yet noticed the sound of more footfall until they were almost behind them, the door is thrown open an angry, puffed-up Bobcat steps past them, straight up to the charcoal rabbit, followed shortly by Jake, who grabs him and pulls him back\]

""YOU ACUSED ME OF WHAT, YOU LITTLE FURBALL! I SWEAR I'M GOING TO - Ahhch... let go! You stupid dog!"" \[He turns to face Jake only before his gaze to stops on silver before he gets thare, he real's back a claw and hisses. Silver, seemingly anticipating the aggression, is already winding up a punch, as he shoves Aloe behind him, when Jake shoves both of them back, stepping between them\]

""STOP BOTH OF YOU STOP!, RIGHT FUCKING NOW, YOU FUCKING IDIOTS!""

\[They both stop mid motion, both surprised by the anger in the usually calm and polite Jake, the moment of silence broken as the flash of action seems to reach the charcoal rabbit who screeches\] ""EE*ee*E**E**EeeE*e*Ee*e*E**EE**Ee!"" \[And dives under the desk again, grabbing a handheld whiteboard and holding it up as a shield\]

\[Everything holds still for a moment as if waiting, to see who would move first...\]

""Will you let go, that hurt's"" \[Aloe wriggles in Silver's grip, who still has hold of her shoulder, holding her behind him\] ""I'm not some ragdoll to push around!"" \[Silver let's go, not breaking eye contact Whith Woods\]

""Sorry, i thought he was going to go for you again""

""Go for her! you bastard, what do you think i am, you asshole, I was going to knock your ass out for, for... I don't know why you just piss me off being all fucking rightshous and shit, acting like some kind of fuckin Knight or some crap""

\[He turns away and growls as he angily picks up a controller and throws it across the room, it hits the wall whith a clatter, shattering into fragments, before turning back and leaning on the desk, seemingly now tired, he looks to Jake\]

""What the fuck is going on?"" \[The 5 of them look at each other for a moment before Jake speaks\]

""Ok, well we're here to get them to stop publishing the next article, I knew this wouldn't be something Ashley would pass up and came to try ask her to at least clear up the misconceptions before things get out of hand""

\[Aloe steps back out from behind Silver, brushing herself off adjusting her ruffled shirt\]

*""Seriously, what's whith all these men fighting all the time, can't they settle things like Civilised people, honestly just gabbing me like that whith his big, rough, strong, warm paws, I'm a Lady! not a steak to be fought over""*

""That's what we're here for too, and you could have found out without acting like ferals!, We *Can* make a Civilised, unified complaint and have the record set straight. I'm no Nark, he's no stalker, and he *presumably* is no dealer""

\[The four now turn thare heads to the Ashley, who backs up further under the desk, squeaking like an old kettle, a thin high high-pitched whine that slowly dies out, as she trembles behind her shield\]

""L--L-Look Weeeeeeee\~ can A-ll Work-k this-s-s out!, don't E-Eat me! EEeeeEeeEeeEeeE\~""

\[Jake looks to both Silver & Woods\] ""Ok you two calm it and sit down, ok, the three of us are going to step back and give her some space, maybe we go back outside, Ms bramble was it?, could i ask you to help calm her, please don't take me as trying to be a misoginist or spiciest usualy i'd try help but i think the last thing she need's right now is a pred trying to get near her""

\[Aloe slowly nods\] ""I can help, I may be annoyed by her but I'm not going to be unkind, oh, and i appreciate the explanation, even if it sounds like an excuse, I'll trust you mean what you say for now""

\[Jake lowers his head a little whith a slight shrug\] ""Fair enough, it definitely could sound like a cop out, so thank you"" \[he gestures to the still tense Silver & Woods to the door before stepping out himself\]

\[Now in the hallway, the subtle stand ofish energy maintains between the two, as Jake stands between them\] ""Ok this is auqwuard... i hate this... um, Andrew, this is my friend Silver, he's a good dude, usually chill, and um Silver, this is Andrew, a new friend, he's also chill, just got a lot going on, ok, u'm please don't fight each other?""

\[his ear's stoop as his tail goes still, his request becoming more of a plea, the two look between each other, then to the stressed-looking Jake, his stature slowly sinking as the silence stretches on\]

""Fine"" - ""Ok"" \[They speak almost in unison, Jake's demeanour returning to normal in a second, the pleading puppy face vanishing in the blink of an eye\] ""See... easy, you don't need to get along, just stop fighting, or I'll be sad for real next time""

\[Silver shighs\] ""your a grown ass man, how do you still pull off the kicked puppy shtic?""

\[Jake smirks\] ""Because I'm still youthful, we might be adult's but I'm definitely not grown up yet, not unless i have to be, Mr Serious"" \[He playfully jabs Silver's chest\]

\[Andrew on the other hand, just looks exhausted and slumps into a chair and sighs\] ""What the fuck man, i make a friend and he's connected to this whole web of shit, can never fukin land on my feet, some cat i am""

\[Meanwhile in the newsroom\]

\[Aloe gently crouches by the opening to the desk and speaks softly\] ""It's ok, Ashley, thare outside, you're safe ok, The Wolf boys are nice, they've gone out of thare way to keep me safe, come on out... that's it you got this, you're more than prey""

\[The shaking dissipates, as Ashley takes deep breaths, muttering to herself in measured whispers's\] ""More than prey, more than prey, more than prey""

\[Slowly she shuffles forward, putting down the whiteboard, and standing up, ear's still drooping behind her\] ""O-ok, i'm ok, i'm ok"" \[then a flush of embarrassment passes over her, her nose and ears, turning red\] ""I'm I- Don't usually have such a strong prey drive, oh my stars this is so emabrising, i feel like a child"" \[her expresion sadens as she ears start to pick themselves back up a little she looks around the room, lingering on the door for moment\]

""It's ok, Alace, we all get scared sometimes, when all that kicked off, i was squealing too"" \[she gestures to one of the photos hanging on a storyboard, a still frame from one of the security cameras from the moment Silver pounced her\]

""And I'm sorry about all this. If I hadn't provoked you three, we wouldn't be in this mess, but I promise i didn't bring snow here to scare you, i just wanted to ask you to stop, to at least clear up the misconceptions, you can really damage people's careers whith accusations like that, and that's not fair on any of us""

\[Noding slowly, Aloe finally looks at Aloe\] ""I know, i- i figured you'd all tell me to eat dirt if I asked you for interview's so i... *We* devised a plan to leverage you into wanting to come clear it up, *we* knew it was wrong, but we got angry at you for chastising us, most of all because you were right. We are not high school girls any more, and if we really want to be journalists, and we do, we need to do it properly.""

""We know most of it, we just need statements from you three""

\[Aloe's ears twitch in curiosity\] ""What do you mean by that?""

\[Alace gives a guilty smirk\] ""We know the cat's dealing, We know about the fight in the hallway, the what's & whys, we know about the coffee shop and the chase on the boulevard, the hound bar, the gay club, and Jake driving you both home, the police interview's, Silver's late night walks in the dark, the cat's visit's to-""

\[Aloe's jaw drops in disbelief\] ""You - YOU WHAT!, what, HOW... HOW""

\[Presumably alerted by the shouting, Jake half opens the door, poking his head through\] ""You ladies, ok please be better than these two""

\[Before either of them could respond, one of the TV's Beeps\] ""We interrupt this scheduled programming to bring you a public announcement: a Chetah is on an active rampage across City Park, attacking everyone in sight, seemingly tracking westbound to a currently unknown location. Rangers have been dispatched to contain the situation""

\[Silver & Andrew push thare way past Jake, into the room watching the screen intently, another broadcast on another TV switches\] ""News just in, a Feline has gone feral in City park, making this the third cat attack this month, following the attack on two University students on the boulevard, and the incident in a downtown grocery store, leading pople to question if-""

\[One by one, the collection of TVs starts to present thare own stories\] ""Following the news of the currently active violent and predatory attack happening right now in City park, the public is demanding answers from Authorities, after the consistent rise in Anti-herd behaviour in predators, what will-.""

\[And another\] ""Ladies and gentlemen, the misinformation machine is strong today, whith news of the scuffle going down in City Park, prey are quick to shout about the rise in predator violence, this is a MISDIRECTION, prey to predator aggression & discrimination has been on the rise for years Well, let me tell you-""

\[And Another\] ""Following the reports of an attack in City Park, mayoral candidate Max Swamps has issued a Campeghn statement, over to him""

\[Screen cuts\] ""Ladies & Gentlemen, this is exactly the kind of incident I have been talking about since the start of my campaign, I have warned and warned about the rise of violent crime that will folow the lack of access to recreational enrichment spaces and access to preditor counceling, statistic's have proven that more young preditor's are turning to Alcohol, to Narcotic's to tobaco and other recreation substances, which we all know lead's to more Violence and crime, if you vote for me-""

\[The five of them watch in disbelief as the stories pour in, timidly, the two other sisters walk in\] ""Alace, Alace, have you seen the... News"" \[They stop, standing next to thare sister, the three hugging each other as they join the silent crowd of watchers, as the first screen changes view from a news room to an overhead stream from a drone above the park, between gaps in the tree's a ragid bloodied chetah looking around in a frenzy runing from tree to tree heading west\]

""Bringing you footage live from the west gate of City Park, the Chetah is still going, rangers are on the scene and are working to capture the animal. We hand you over to Laura Breaker in City Park, Laura over to you""

\[The view switches to a ground crew, on foot, chasing after the Chetah officers in uniforms beside them\]

""Thanks, Steve, the situation here in City Park is pretty grim whith at least 9 people injured, 3 of whom might be in critical condition. We are still awaiting the numbers from the emergency response veterinarians on site here whith the victims, as you can see, the rangers here are preparing for a corral manoeuvre, planning to encircle them and tire them out, the attacker can only keep up this speed and energy for a short period before they give out, whith this attack having been going for a staggering 3 and a half minutes already, they surely can't have much more left""

\[They watch for a few more minutes as they continue to fight before a weighted net is thrown and the stunned Chetah is tackled to the ground and pinned by several Raingers. Silence hangs in the room for a few minutes before Andrew is the first to speak\] ""Shit, this is bad, oh fuck I'm cooked... we're all cooked every pred in the city is cooked, and me and every other felid is doubled cooked and deep fuckin fried""

\[A short siren blast is followed by the cracking of the Uni PA\] ""All students return to your assigned dorm room immediately, non-residents please assemble in the main carpark, Prediror's by muster point A, prey by Muster C, that is all""

\[Aloe mutters quietly whith a sigh\] ""Well, that's a bad Omen"" \[Her statement is met by groans and hushed swearing as they all part wordlessly, returning to thare rooms\]

**I'd rate it about 3.8/5 stars overall.**

# What I liked about Yu TrimFit Purple Tea

First off, I appreciate that this isn't just another repackaged green tea with laxatives. The Kenyan purple tea base is genuinely different from what I've tried before. It doesn't give me that jittery feeling I get from heavily caffeinated teas, which makes sense given it has 42% less caffeine than typical green tea.

If you're sensitive to caffeine like I am, this is actually a decent alternative that won't have you bouncing off walls or crashing later.

The appetite suppression effect is moderate but noticeable. I found it helped me avoid my usual 3pm snack cravings, which I attribute to the Caralluma Fimbriata in the blend. Nothing miraculous, but it does take the edge off hunger better than regular tea.

However, appetite suppression effect was still milder than some other brands like [**this one, which is currently my no.1 pick**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) for appetite suppression, and weight loss.

¬†

# Where Yu TrimFit falls short

¬†

My biggest complaint? The proprietary blend. At 513mg total, I have no idea how much of each ingredient I'm actually getting. Is there enough Caralluma Fimbriata to make a difference? How much L-Theanine am I getting with my caffeine? This lack of transparency is frustrating and common in the supplement industry.

I also found the results to be modest at best as well as some people I coach. Those claims about significant BMI decreases and reduced abdominal fat? My clients didn't experience anything that dramatic, while using this alone as weight loss aid.

It helped a bit with appetite control, but don't expect miracles without diet and exercise changes.

# How it compares to other weight loss teas

¬†Unlike those ""skinny teas"" that are essentially ***glorified laxatives*** (looking at you, detox teas that had me running to the bathroom every hour), **Yu TrimFit doesn't cause digestive distress**. As someone who had a horrific experience with a Chinese slimming tea that, as one user aptly put, ""made me crap out my soul,"" I truly appreciate this.

It's definitely better than those teas that are just caffeine bombs meant to speed up your metabolism temporarily. The polyphenol content in purple tea seems legitimate, and I didn't experience the crash I've had with heavily caffeinated options.

However, if you're comparing pure value, an affordable loose-leaf Japanese green tea like sencha might still give you similar benefits at a better price point.

Many users in tea subreddits also mentioned simply drinking plain green tea helped them manage snacking without any fancy formulations.

# Who might benefit from Yu TrimFit

If you're looking for a gentle appetite suppressant without laxative effects, this could work for you. It's especially good if you:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Get anxious from high caffeine content

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Want something to help curb snacking

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Prefer a tea that won't cause digestive issues

If you're expecting dramatic weight loss without changing your diet or exercise habits, you'll likely be disappointed. Like most users have noted about various teas, they work best as part of a comprehensive approach to weight management.

# Bottom line

Yu TrimFit Purple Tea is a decent, middle-of-the-road option in the weight loss tea market. It's not a miracle product, but it's not snake oil either. My advice? Try it if you're curious about the unique purple tea benefits, but keep your expectations realistic and remember it's a supplement, not a solution.

All in all, Yu trim fit purple tea is a decent powerhouse of antioxidants that fight off **free radicals**, crush **inflammation**, and may help moderately with appetite suppression and **fat loss**.

# My current recommendations

¬†

While ***Yu TrimFit*** has its merits, [**this brand (my rating 4.8 / 5)**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) is still my go-to weight management tea. What sets it apart is the brilliant two-phase system‚Äîa Morning Energy tea that kickstarts metabolism with green tea, oolong, ginseng, and garcinia cambogia, paired with an Evening Detox blend containing senna leaves, licorice root, and fennel.

I've found this comprehensive approach works better than Yu TrimFit's single formula by addressing both daytime energy/metabolism and nighttime detoxification/bloating.

The taste is remarkably pleasant (especially with natural monk fruit sweetness), making it something I actually look forward to drinking, unlike many weight management teas.

After trying dozens of tea formulations over the years, this remains the most balanced and effective option I've found for managing appetite, energy levels, and occasional bloating without harsh side effects.

# What Makes Purple Tea Unique?

First off, Purple Tea is grown exclusively in the **high-altitude farms of Kenya**, where extreme UV rays force the tea plant to produce **anthocyanins** to protect itself. These compounds give it its vibrant purple color and make it a nutritional powerhouse.

**Purple Tea contains GHG**, a rare polyphenol not found in other teas. Studies show that GHG helps reduce **fat absorption** and enhances your body‚Äôs ability to burn fat by boosting liver metabolism. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs gaining so much buzz in the weight-loss world.

Compared to green tea, Purple Tea has **1.6x more polyphenols** and 42% less caffeine.

And the antioxidants ‚Äì Purple Tea has a **51% free-radical scavenging rate** compared to just 34% in green tea. That means it‚Äôs better at fighting oxidative stress, keeping your body healthy and energized.

# The Role of Purple Tea in Weight Loss

Unlike most weight-loss teas that rely heavily on caffeine or questionable additives, Purple Tea works through **science-backed mechanisms** that are actually good for your body.

Here‚Äôs the deal: Purple Tea contains a unique compound called **GHG** (1,2-di-O-galloyl-4,6-O-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-Œ≤-D-glucose)‚Äì it helps reduce **fat absorption** in your body while boosting **fat metabolism** in your liver.

Basically, it tackles the fat storage process at two key points. So, instead of storing those excess calories as fat, your body starts burning them more efficiently.

In studies, people who consumed Purple Tea daily for **4 weeks** saw significant improvements in weight-loss markers:

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **BMI decreased**

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Body fat mass reduced**

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Abdominal fat and waist size shrank**

In animal studies, it also reduced **triglyceride levels** (those fats in your blood linked to obesity and heart disease).

Chronic inflammation can actually make it harder for your body to shed pounds by slowing your metabolism. Its¬† **polyphenols** and **anthocyanins**, which fight **inflammation** and oxidative stress help in weight loss too.

Purple Tea also contains **caffeine**, but at a much lower level compared to green or black tea. This small amount gives your metabolism a gentle boost without causing energy crashes.

# Additional Health Benefits of Purple Tea

It is a **super drink** packed with health benefits that go way beyond burning fat.

1. **Packed with Antioxidants**: Purple Tea contains a **higher level of antioxidants** than green tea. Thanks to compounds like **anthocyanins** and **EGCG**, it fights **free radicals** in your body, which are responsible for aging, inflammation, and chronic diseases. It‚Äôs like giving your body a protective shield against oxidative stress.
2. **Improves Brain Health**: Purple Tea‚Äôs **EGCG** (epigallocatechin gallate) and antioxidants protect brain cells from damage and may help prevent **cognitive decline**. Early research even shows its potential to fight **degenerative brain diseases** like Alzheimer‚Äôs.
3. **Blood Sugar Control**: If you‚Äôre diabetic or trying to keep blood sugar in check, Purple Tea helps regulate **glucose absorption**, preventing those post-meal sugar spikes.
4. **Cardiovascular Support**: With its unique mix of polyphenols, Purple Tea helps reduce **bad cholesterol** and triglycerides while protecting your heart.
5. **Low Caffeine Content**: Unlike energy drinks or strong teas, Purple Tea gives you a mild caffeine boost without jitters. It‚Äôs perfect for hydration at any time of the day.

¬†

# How to Use TrimFit Purple Tea for Weight Loss

**1. Brew it Right:**

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Use **1-2 teaspoons** of Purple Tea leaves for an 8-ounce cup.

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pour hot water (around 175-185¬∞F; not boiling) over the leaves and let it steep for **3-4 minutes**. Over-steeping might make it slightly bitter.

**2. When to Drink It:**

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† For best results, have Purple Tea **20-30 minutes before meals**. This helps reduce fat absorption from food and supports digestion.

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Try drinking it in the morning or early afternoon to kickstart your metabolism without the jitters you‚Äôd get from coffee.

**3. Consistency is Key:**  
To see noticeable results, aim to drink **2-3 cups daily**. Studies showed that consistent use over **4-6 weeks** led to significant reductions in body fat and waist size.

**Pro Tip:** Avoid adding sugar or cream. If you need a bit of sweetness, a drop of honey works well.

# Pros

# ‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Natural Fat Burning: Contains GHG and polyphenols that enhance fat oxidation, metabolism, and reduce fat absorption.

# ‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rich in Antioxidants: Packed with anthocyanins (15x more than blueberries), which fight oxidative stress, reduce inflammation, and support cell health.

# ‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Supports Blood Sugar Control: Regulates glucose absorption, making it beneficial for diabetics and those managing insulin levels.

# ¬†

# Cons

# ‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mild Effects: Results like weight loss or metabolism boost require consistent use over time; it‚Äôs not a quick fix. If weight loss is the goal, you're likely to have better results with other brands.

# ‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Limited Availability: Not as widely available as green or black tea; premium pricing may apply due to exclusivity.

# ‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Subtle Caffeine Boost: If you‚Äôre looking for a strong energy kick, Purple Tea‚Äôs low caffeine content might feel underwhelming.

# ‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Taste Preference: The earthy, mildly floral flavor may not appeal to everyone, especially those used to sweeter beverages.

# ‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Not a Standalone Solution: Works best as part of a balanced diet and active lifestyle; cannot replace proper nutrition or exercise.

# ‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Potential Interactions: May interact with blood sugar or blood pressure medications; consultation with a doctor is recommended for specific conditions.

# My final Performance Evaluation (Ratings) of TrimFit Tea

# 1. Appetite Control: 3.5/5

Purple Tea‚Äôs **caffeine content** plays a role in reducing appetite by stimulating the central nervous system, which helps **curb cravings naturally.** Additionally, it prevents sudden hunger spikes caused by glucose crashes.

# 2. Energy Enhancement: 3.5/5

With **42% less caffeine** than green tea, Purple Tea provides a **mild energy boost** without the jitters or crashes.

# 3. Metabolism Boosting: 3.5/5

Its combination of mild caffeine and antioxidants contributes to a moderate but steady boost in metabolic rate, making it effective for long-term results.

# 4. Fat Oxidation and Burning: 4/5

Research highlights that Purple Tea reduces **fat absorption** while enhancing fat burning, thanks to its unique compounds like **GHG and EGCG**. Human studies have shown reductions in **body fat mass**, BMI, and waist size over time

Purple Tea helps inhibit **glucose absorption**, which prevents post-meal blood sugar spikes. This makes it particularly beneficial for individuals managing **blood sugar levels** or insulin sensitivity.

# 6. Cognitive Support and Mental Clarity: 3.5/5

¬†It‚Äôs not a quick brain stimulant but supports long-term mental clarity. The **EGCG** and **anthocyanins** in Purple Tea act as **neuroprotective** agents, improving brain health and clarity. Early studies suggest it may help protect against degenerative diseases while enhancing focus.

# 7. Digestive and Gut Health: 3.5/5

Purple Tea supports **gut health** indirectly through its antioxidants, which help reduce inflammation. While it‚Äôs not a probiotic or digestive-focused tea, its polyphenols contribute to a healthier gut environment and improved digestion.

# 8. Safety and Tolerability: 4.8/5

Purple Tea is **very safe** for most people, thanks to its low caffeine content and natural composition. It‚Äôs gentle on the stomach and well-tolerated, with minimal risk of side effects unless you have a tea-specific allergy or extreme caffeine sensitivity.

# 9. Long-Term Effectiveness: 4/5

When consumed consistently, Purple Tea offers **sustainable benefits** like fat loss, improved metabolism, and cognitive support. It‚Äôs not a quick fix but works gradually with regular use, making it ideal for long-term weight management and health improvements.

From the neon glow of Banjara Hills to the tech hubs in Hitech City, everyone‚Äîfrom startups to established firms‚Äîwas searching for branding services that could do more than just design logos; they wanted stories, consistency, and a visual identity that resonated.

That‚Äôs where Scintilla Kreations comes in.

Scintilla Kreations is not just another design studio‚Äîit‚Äôs one of Hyderabad‚Äôs most respected full‚Äëservice branding and advertising agencies. They don‚Äôt limit themselves to just aesthetics; their focus is on building a brand personality that aligns with what a company stands for. They help businesses define who they are‚Äîunderstanding target audiences, deciphering values, shaping voice, designing logos, choosing colour palettes that feel authentic, crafting marketing collateral, designing packaging, and ensuring the digital presence (website, social media visuals) matches the offline identity. [Scintilla Digi+2Local Biz Network+2](https://scintilladigi.com/services/branding/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

One thing that sets them apart: innovation through technology. Scintilla Kreations embraces AI‚Äëpowered video production, photorealistic visuals, and immersive storytelling to deliver branding and ad content that‚Äôs not just pretty but impactful. Their in‚Äëhouse production facility lets them control quality end‚Äëto‚Äëend‚Äîfrom concept to final video edit. 

Outside their office, brand consultants in Hyderabad talk about what good branding truly means: consistency in every touchpoint, authenticity in message, clarity in value, and adaptability across channels (print, web, video, social media). Local businesses are increasingly seeking partners who can not only ‚Äúmake things look good‚Äù but also strategise where and how to tell their story‚Äîwhat visuals to use, what tone, how to engage on Instagram vs LinkedIn, when to use video, when to use design, how packaging can influence customer perception, etc.

Many small enterprises used to do bits of branding themselves‚Äîlogo here, flyer there‚Äîbut clients are now leaning toward agencies like Scintilla Kreations that handle the whole journey. From discovering the brand‚Äôs roots, to defining tone, visuals, designing assets, producing video content, rolling out marketing campaigns, and maintaining brand coherence over time. [Scintilla Digi](https://scintilladigi.com/services/branding/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

In a neighborhood caf√© in Hitech City, a young entrepreneur named Priya sips coffee while scrolling through portfolios on her laptop. She‚Äôs launching an eco‚Äëpackaging startup. She needs a brand identity that feels clean, trustworthy, modern‚Äîbut also warm and sustainable. She sees a video by Scintilla Kreations‚Äîan AI‚Äëdriven promotional video for a product, visuals that feel lifelike, voiceovers and colours that align with her taste. She reaches out. The first meeting is a discovery session: what matters to Priya, who her customers are, what image she wants in 5 years. Weeks later, she has a logo that echoes leaves and light, packaging that uses clean typography and earthy tones, a website that behaves smoothly, a video that tells her story with texture and soul.

And as her new brand identity rolls out‚Äîon Instagram posts, on product boxes, in an explainer video‚Äîher customers begin to recognize the style: that same logo, that same voice, that trustworthiness. Sales begin to rise. The brand doesn‚Äôt just look good; it feels consistent. Word spreads. Priya realises that branding isn‚Äôt a cost‚Äîit‚Äôs an investment in clarity, difference, and recall.



If you‚Äôre in Hyderabad and you‚Äôre considering branding services‚ÄîScintilla Kreations is a name to watch. They embody what many local businesses are seeking: creativity + strategy + tech. Whether you need logo design, packaging, ad films, brand messaging, or AI‚Äëpowered video content, they offer integrated solutions. And in a city where visual noise is relentless, having a coherent, well‚Äëthought brand identity isn‚Äôt just nice‚Äîit‚Äôs essential.",1,1759991213.0,u_No-Situation1716,0,1.0,False

As the title says I just need this off. I dont really have any friends I can vent this to nor family I trust so here goes. Im getting married  very soon. I love my partner. Been together for almost a decade and I still feel as if I cant be away from him. Hes the love of my life. Hes honestly destroyed every bit of self confidence and self worth I've had. Its not on purpose. I know he loves me. I know im not a priority or a need for him as much as he is for me. I know it's bad to have this much codependency on someone but im scared of being alone. Always have been even as a kid. I've struggled with horrible depression in the past and while its been a very long time since its gotten bad, the memories are still ingrained in me no matter how much i just want to forget and move on. The last time being mother's day i think 2022? I wont be to  descriptive to much but it involved prescription pills. Never swallowed just let it sit there till my mouth was numb and just zoned out for a while. I've never spelled it out specifically but I know I've made it aware how it was for me multiple times back then. I just get a text of ""oh im sorry"" followed by ""im going to bed I love you goodnight"". I know I had horrible timing with this happening but I cant control when it happens. It hurt that there was never effort for me and I hate myself for being mad when his childhood best friend would text him saying stuff like im sorry and I love you to him.  my partner assumed  he was ending it and always made a point to rush to his place ASAP. I know this cause every time it occurred we were together. The last time it happened he rushed out on our date. I had to get a ride home from my sister. There's more tbh but i feel like this is to long already.  I won't leave. Ever. I love him. I love his family. They've supported me so much throughout the years any every way possible and theyre a healthy family to around. No one talks shit about each other. There's no walking on eggshells and theres no fear or toxicity at all. Just genuine love and support freely given. Im sorry this is so long and I will delete this soon, maybe in a day or to. If you've made this far then thank you. It genuinely means the world to me. I wish I cant let the past be the past and move on like the 20 something adult that I am. I wish I didn't have to beg for flowers once a month just to never get it unless im crying/begging. I wish I wasn't so insecure with myself that he doesn't find me attractive anymore and he would prefer if I was like the people he watches in porn. I wish I didn't feel stupid  and childish for asking for the same thing all the time because I'm scared to inconvenience him with getting me coffee once a week or surprise with flowers. I wish we could go out to places I enjoy without him looking miserable being there. I wish i was confident again. I wish i wasnt insecure and scared all the time. I wish that i was loved and cherished as much as he is to me. I wish things were different but you cant change the past. We will be married this year and I dont think anything will change, but the least I can do is hope. I love him to much to do so otherwise ",3,1759990750.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False

I've finished 4/6 rounds of TAC chemo, with number 5 on Saturday.

Today, there was a local festival going on for Hangeul Day (we live in Korea). It was about 6 km away from our apartment, but my husband had already made plans to play in his company's soccer game. I almost gave up on going since my husband would need the car, but they were having an airshow that I knew my son would love to see. So, I threw on a mask, put my son on his bike, and off we went!

Halfway through the airshow, I almost cried because I honestly thought I would have 5 months of not being there for my son... but there we were, just SO happy. Hopefully, he's not going to remember the few days I wasn't there, but maybe he will remember the day that he and mom walked to the airshow, stopped for some coffee and juice, and had such a lovely day.

I remember, after learning about my treatment plan, that my number one concern was how much time I would lose with my 4-year-old. This diagnosis has really made me appreciate my time with him, and the idea that for five months I wouldn't really be there for him was the most upsetting thing for me to accept. However, just like I was told when I first showed up here scared, I still have the good weeks that are filled with days like today. They might not be walking 6 km with a 4 year old (*\*pats back\**), but they're filled with me being there for my son and making memories I'm happy to keep. Also, I taught myself to crochet and finished a beanie today!
