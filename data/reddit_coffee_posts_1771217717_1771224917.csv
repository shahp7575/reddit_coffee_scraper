1r62lnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1r62lnf/4_weeks_in_vietnam_as_30yrs_old_dude_semisolo_1st/,4 weeks in Vietnam as 30yrs old dude (semi)solo. 1st part: Hanoi,"Hiya fellas, i just finished my 4 weeks adventure in Vietnam and i thought  i will share it will my fellow travelers. 

I did North to South from 09. January ‘til 12 of February. I did not really have a tight budget but i’ll try to share some costs, prices and tips with y’all.
If you wanna skip the story, you gonna find the budget in the bottom.

1st Part: Hanoi
I arrived after 18hrs of flight (layovers included) Jet-lagging AF i couldn’t sleep a second on neither of the flights so i was done. I haven’t been this disoriented and tired since my raving phase ended in my mid twenties iykyk…

I tried to buy a local sim card at the airport, ofc i did not know that my phone was locked and i did not have a backup phone, so i accepted my fate and started walking out of the airport while trying to log in the wifi to order a grab. Did i mention i was tired af?
A Taxi driver grabbed me, i asked the price he said 320.000 (ca 10€) for a 40 minutes drive.
I said ok. He made me pay for the airport toll but i was so done, i did not care anymore so i just payed it. I still don’t remember how much he grabbed and at that point I couldn’t care less i just wanted to sleep. (Lesson learned, order a grab)

I arrived to MadMonkey (my first party Hostel).
I checked in, put my shit to the room and went down to the bar to grab a coffee. I just stood outside the Hostel for 30 minutes trying to breathe in the beautiful chaos (and smog) of the city. 

After talking with the crew and getting convince to join the “Drag queen” event i went for a little nap to my dorm. 4 bunkbeds a little trashed, a dude just shaved all his pubes and left it in the shower but hey, it’s part of the game.

I woke up (several times) about 2hrs later. And went down to the bar to make some new friends.
It did not take long, after 1 hrs i was partying with Aussies, Americans, Indians and a sweet couple from Scotland. And the show hasn’t even started yet.
Shout out to Cruze, and the local Worker who always lies about his name and nationality. They know how to make a party.

You might think a drag show is not for you. I tell you you are wrong. You could not be more wrong.
It was FUN with capital letters.

After getting proper fucked up, we went on the pub crawl. Good thing is Mad Monkey is 20meters away from beer street. Ngl I lasted only for 2 bars, then i hit a joint someone was offering and decided it is time, wait i’ll rephrase it: Now or never (or at least not on my own legs). I walked back to the hostel, crawled in my bed and got my well deserved sleep what was only interrupted 13 times that night from people getting in or leaving. 
100% worth it, what a night.

The next day i forced myself out of the bed around 11:00am. I felt surprisingly good. I ate a Bahn Mi (basically a baguette sandwich) it was kind of sweet but it was OK for like 1€. 
I wanted some soup to cure my hangover. I went to try the famous Pho soup. I was sweet again… but it did the job.
The hostel has a daily free walking tour through the City with some historical storytelling. And they took us to the big local market and to the train street.

When we got back i signed up for the Ha Giang loop what started on the next day (4+1day). The night before literally everyone was talking about that, there were guys who had done it 4 times already so it seemed like a must do. 

The hangover finally kicked in. Time for rest.

Hanoi budget:
Airport to Hostel Grab or taxi 270.000-320.000vnd (8-11€) everything over that is a scam.
Hostel 6€/night with breakfast incl.
Bahn Mi sandwich 30.000vnd (1€)
Pho soup 40-100.000vnd (1-3€)
Coffe on the street 30-80.000vnd (1-3€)
Pack of cigarettes 20-55.000vnd (1-2€)
Shoe cleaning on the street 30-100.000vnd (1-3€)
Beers in a deli 16.000vnd (0.55€)
Beers in bars or beerstreet 30-60.000vnd (1-2€)
Coctails and other drinks: i don’t remember i was fucked.

Ha Giang loop with easyrider 4+1 day (all included) through Mad Monkey: 7.000.000vnd (230€)

The next part is——> The Ha Giang loop

(2026) - A love Story That is both Beautiful and flawed, but delivers the Good","https://preview.redd.it/pd5w04gklsjg1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=86db9f080827b3438aa42d9ffac12e6d0fcea0dd

Annyeonghaseyo Everyone. Hope you all would be doing well in your respective lives. Today, for the next instalment in this review series, I'm going to review **'Can This Love Be Translated?' (2026**) - first time I'm reviewing a latest-released drama after re-subscribing my Netflix Plan. Actually, I wanted to cover the review of 'Coffee Prince' (2007), but since I couldn't complete it, I decided to review 'Can This love Be Translated?'. Hope you would enjoy today's review as well as the future contents this community will offer. So, without wasting much time, let's get started:

As I said earlier in my review of 'Secret Love', Love is a very strange thing, but it is also a thing most people, if not all, get confused of. Love represents even the most deepest things present in our heart, yet we still get confused that if it is the feeling of love, just like how difference in language creates confusion. This presentation of love as a language, a feeling that urges you to come out and express - is the core of 'Can This Love Be Translated?', which is both beautiful and flawed at times, but somehow it delivers the Good and continues a very good run of romantic K-dramas that continues to evolve in this era of New Age.

Released in 2026, **'Can This Love Be Translated?'** is a beautiful, experimental love-travel story that signifies the love as language, and it delivers this message perfectly. It's a perfect love story that will never leave you get bored, even if you feel pinched by its flaws. If we talk about the plot and storytelling, it's written beautifully because the concept is pretty much of high scale and there remains a chance that it would get crashed down completely from the word go; however, the makers did manage the plot excellently by combining the elements of love with a deep emotional depth and metaphors presented through the visuals and dialogues, which enhances the quality of this story. However, the mixing of genres (which might catch the rom-com fans off-guard) and the dragged pacing in the middle of this series is where the flaws get started, and cliches become visible. It would have been good if it would have been a 14 or say 15-episodes drama to flow out this story. Despite this, the story with a metaphorical plot and the themes, along with the performances of the cast, ensures the success of this drama. All in all, it's a good work done by makers, but honestly speaking, it could have been great due to its potential.

Moving to cast performances, the leads of this drama - **Kim Seon Ho and Go Youn-Jong** are the main highlight of this drama. The pairing of these two works perfectly with their sweet, slow-burn chemistry, that looked brilliantly when combined with the metaphorical and picturesque visuals. **Kim Seon-Ho, as Joo Ho-Jin**, gives a very strong performance that perfectly matches his own personality - subtle, layered, and quietly magnetic as the reserved language interpreter who slowly opens up. Considering his performances in other dramas, this role might have be the start for the makers to consider **Kim Seon-Ho** as a main lead, because he elevates every scene and matches the demand of the story beat-by-beat. **Go Youn-Jong** also gives an equally brilliant performance as **Cha Mu-Hee**. She displayed the emotions of her character perfectly and resoundingly - combined with vulnerability, fire, and quiet devastation in a way that feels painfully authentic. Their slow-burn chemistry is like a chef’s kiss — awkward, tender, and deeply satisfying. The Second ML, Sota Fukushi, is brilliant in his character of Hiro Kurosawa. He perfectly showcases the elegancy with humour of his character, and considering he's Japanese, this works even more perfectly. The supporting cast also gave good performance through their comedic humour.

The OST and the background music is brilliant. The Songs give you the vibes of love and romance, which elevates the scene. The cinematography is one of the best I've seen since Goblin and Something in the Rain - Visually Stunning and Picturesque, not letting you to go and making you feel alive. Considering this drama is a travelogue drama, this is the most striking part of this drama's success.

Overall, it's a **8/10** for me. It's a good drama to binge with your partners, although it could have great considering the story's rich potential, but the other good things of this drama are enough to compensate the flaws.

1r62jgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1r62jgk/do_you_really_love_me/,Do You Really Love Me?,"*I hate this so much*. I don’t think I could ever hate you though, my love. But you keep holding me at an arm’s length and I’m tired of trying to convince you to let your walls down for me. I’ve put myself out there countless times for you and yet you’ve still made no real attempts to get closer to me. You’ve never even asked for my phone number or a social account so we could communicate more, right? I tried asking for your number the first time we tried and you pretended not to hear me asking you (don’t think I forgot that either)….

*If it was anybody else then the answer would be obvious, right*? I can’t and won’t keep making exceptions or excuses for you. *Not this time*. And you can try to play slow all you want but I know everything you’ve done up to this point was calculated and manipulative. I just wish I understood your endgame in all of this…

Maybe you’re still upset that I left you for her but won’t say it? That was your fault alone and you know that too…*I would’ve picked you a thousand times if I knew you would do the same for me.*

But you don’t or rather *won’t* take that leap for me for whatever reason still to this day. Despite everything we’ve been through and all the love I’ve shown you over the years you continue to play with my emotions. It seemed like things were progressing too but it always feels that way before you pull back again. You know me well enough to know that I will not wait up for you but you really did a number on me this round. I don’t know if I can keep up the charades with you…

I lived life without you in it once and I never wanted to go through that again. But I know I will never find true love if I keep holding out for you which has brought me to this crossroads now. You insinuate I’m the other half of your heart and sometimes I believe you too. But I still want and require more from you, my child. *Show me that this is rea*l, show me that this what you truly want and I will stand by you until the end of time I swear it. *You are the one my soul is drawn to whether I like it or not;* I would need no others if I had you fully. But until you can commit to me or at least make an actual attempt to grow our relationship, I think it’s best that we take some time apart from each other again. I want you in my life but this only ends with more heartbreak if we continue down this path without making changes. 

I hope you took some time to reflect on our last encounter in the meantime too. I really do want to be a friend though and I feel like I’ve done my best but you keep dangling your love in front of me like it is mine for the taking when really that isn’t the case. I know you spent the rest of “lover’s day” alone too but it never had to be that way…*just some food for thought*. I hope your week goes well though, I’d be lying if I said I was looking forward to seeing you again…

*Love,*

Hey reddit,

A little about me:

I'm 32, 5'8"", Latino, from Hollywood. 

I'm a nerdy guy who loves going to pool bars, like music, video games and things along those lines. I'm a pretty easy going guy. I can be shy, but once we vibe, I can open up pretty easily. I am pretty ""go with the flow"" kind of guy. 

What I'm looking for: 

First and foremost, someone who wants to cuddle. I love hugs and physical touch. Someone who is receptive to that. I am looking for something a little more romantic, but platonic is okay too as long as that is communicated. Communication is very important to me. 

I can host and we can meet up for some coffee beforehand to see how we vibe and get along! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to respond to this ad! 

Cheers

1r62h8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/handpickedberlin/comments/1r62h8b/berlin_or_cdu_wants_a_maglev_train_i_just_want_a/,Berlin (or CDU?) wants a maglev train. I just want a tram that gets green lights. (Issue: #186),"That’s one of the stories in today’s [Handpicked Berlin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#).

The CDU is pushing a magnetic levitation train between Tegel (Urban Tech Republic) and Spandau. One of the arguments: it won’t get stuck in traffic like a tram. So I was thinking, maybe totally naively: what if we just prioritise trams properly? And pedestrians. And bikes? I spend half my life waiting at red lights (looking at you, Reichpietschufer/Schöneberger Ufer at Potsdamer Platz).

But yeah, let’s try with a meglev feasibility study.

On the funding side, Berlin had a solid week:

* metiundo raised €40M (smart metering & energy data)
* Andercore €33.5M Series B (AI industrial trade)
* Circle Health €9M Seed (AI preventive care)
* hellomed €6M Seed (medication error prevention)

Outside Berlin:

* Hades Mining (Munich) €15M
* driveblocks (Munich) €3.5M
* conmeet (Borken) €1.3M

And yes, €0.99 espresso is coming. Cotti Coffee is expanding into Germany, eventually probably also in Berlin (it will be fun when they open at Kotti?). Independent cafés, stay strong. The hot takes are loading or maybe also not, because the influencers moved on?

Career-wise, I included a great (and very sober) response to the viral “AI will take all your jobs” essay that went viral last week. I’m increasingly in the camp of, yeah, it will change the way we work, but won't be replacing us. But I do feel it intensified my work: doing more, not less. Slightly terrifying.

Also: BASF is reportedly cutting 1,000+ jobs in Berlin. Not great.

New issue is out... Read for the full breakdown of funding, jobs, strikes and lawsuits (yes, you might get €5k from Meta): [https://newsletter.handpickedberlin.com/p/will-ai-replace-all-of-us](https://newsletter.handpickedberlin.com/p/will-ai-replace-all-of-us)

>Some data points that really surprised me: 

1. Sheer linguistic diversity of India 
2. Baby boom of India over. 
3. North East Delhi being most dense popln wise...I'm from Delhi, but still thought Mumbai would be on top.

5. Justice system is broken af. 1 real live, 3 fake crimes is a good way to remember... 
6. Chicken>>>>>other animals. Wow. How? Westernization? Cheaper? NCC egg campaign??
7. Fewer Indians drink, but boy do they drink!! This I can attest to 😆
8. India's crime clock tick is just depressing af...that too of reported crimes. 
9. Delhi not crime capital...well sortof. 
10. More married women than men (seemed like a trick question at first)
11. Rs 1 lcr economy 💩!! Wow. 
12. How unemployment rate is calculated in India is simply a joke 🤣 
13. Trade as % GDP is amazing...what a turnaround in past 20 yrs...India is more globalised than China?! 
14. Didn't know Indians have won every Nobel Prize category! Only 7 other nations have done so, that too due to West's bias much of the time. (I knew we  had won Nobels, but in all categories! Never clicked in my mind) 
15. Last but not least, more Indians die for world peace than any other nations...😔 Graph 60 shows how UNPKF is funded by global North, sacrificed by global South. That's f*cked up. Never hear much about it either. Yes even WW1 and WW2 deaths included many Indians, but after 1948 too?!

In the US, the Bayaband clog typically costs $50, in india, the same cost around ₹4000 (after sales, that is). Now if you were to use the conversion rate of 1 USD =90 INR, you would be inclined to say, meh, big difference, this guy, oc is a joke.
But wait.
Let's talk about PPP (Purchasing Power Parity).
PPP reflects the relative value of currencies based on a basket of goods and services. For 2026, the PPP exchange rate is approximately ₹20.10 per USD (meaning ₹20.10 in India buys what $1 buys in the US).
This makes sense, a cup of coffee here costs roughly ₹100, while in US, it costs $5.
So, why is crocs charging well over 4x times?!!

We had talked about getting one for a couple of months but never used one before and wasn't sure how well they would operate. Our Air BnB on vacation had one and after using it for 2 weeks, we came to the conclusion that we needed to get one..very very convenient and puts out a lot of ice quick. We use it as our main ice source instead of the fridge ice maker. This would be great for a mini bar or dorm room as well.

Even with as much ice as I use, we still only need to fill with water every day and a half. It takes up very little space and can be put just about anywhere there is a plug in. Melting ice drips back into the water tank so there is no loss of water if you don't use the ice and it knows when ice is being taken out and makes more. If ice is not being used, it doesn't keep making ice..it just goes into a 'sleep mode' as I call it, but as soon as you take ice out, it starts making ice again.

Its very easy to clean (pretty much same as a coffee maker for hard water deposits) and without a doubt one of the most functional appliances we've purchased.

I want to know what your experience using this ic maker did you face any issues yet? ",1,1771223588.0,u_Glass_Example4879,2,1.0,False

But I appreciated everyone’s advice, and even constructive criticism, so throwing this back into the ether:

Working my 2nd 11-11 shift today, day 7/8 of my current stretch. Because of short turnaround times, I’ve also gotten 4 hours of sleep the past 2 nights. I’m working as the sole trauma resident (on the ER side), as an intern, seeing 2-3 patients an hour. Recently went from 10 on my list to 5 after a few discharges.

At this point it’s 7:30, and I haven’t had time to eat, drink coffee, or even pee. There is finally a lull in which I can suture a geriatric patient’s very jagged, complicated forehead laceration, which overlies a hematoma. So, what do I (stupidly) decide to do? I decide to kill 2 birds with one stone, taking the suturing as an opportunity to take a breather, and take my time with the procedure. As I’m stitching the patient up, the bites are causing his hematoma to pop. I’m leisurely squeezing the blood out, Dr. Pimple Popper-esque, as I go, while attempting to talk to the (now sundowning) patient about his family. As I’m suturing, 2 trauma activations come in, which my attending takes on her own. All in all, the procedure took about an hour; which, I KNOW is too long, but I sort of got lost in a sleep-deprived trance while doing it. Almost like highway hypnosis. This was the only “break” I was going to get my whole shift, so I suppose, subconsciously, I wanted to take advantage of it.

I am met with the utmost criticism once the laceration is finished. My attending, in a soft yet stern manor, tells me I CANNOT take this long on procedures. “When you’re an attending, and you’re alone, you CAN’T take this long to do a procedure. You WILL get pulled away to other tasks. What went wrong? What took you so long?”

I explain to her the complexity of the lac, the zigzagged edges, and the thinness of patient’s skin. I tell her that, as an intern, the PAs get most of the lacerations, and I will need more practice. But in my heart of hearts, I know that’s only 50% of the reason. I know, deep down, that I just needed a minute to breathe. A minute to “relax”,  while squeezing out hematoma blood. And, hey, 2 less notes when you already have 20 to write at home is a precious gift.

I am tired, and I’m trying my best. Why can’t 99%, on the rare occasion, be good enough? Why must it always be 100%?",4,1771223547.0,Residency,3,0.75,False

I need some help","I hope it's ok I talk about all facets of my addiction here, not just the alcohol.  I really need to go to a meeting. Man, I just got out of detox for the 10th time.  This time for kratom and marijuana., and for also abusing my Suboxone I got 2 years ago for using kratom.  I'm an alcoholic, though I haven't drank in almost 3 years.  But I'll tell ya, I've been more and more miserable as life goes on.  I'm about to turn 40.  I am an addict of anything I touch.  Alcohol was always my first drug of choice.  I'm blessed to not have drank, but I am a dry alcoholic.  

I'm set to go into a well established treatment center.  They have a holistic approach.  They do weight lifting, cardio, yoga, writing groups, process therapy, something called recovery in action, team based exercises.  It's also a sober living environment. 

They are brand new to accepting state insurance , and it is covering the cost of treatment.  I have to pay for rent and food.  

I was meant to go door to door transfer, meaning they were to pick me up at detox.   I got medically cleared today, and got a ride home without telling them.  I am fucking terrified.   I haven't worked out in 3 years, I've gained 40 pounds over my average, I've been sitting and playing video games/staring at my computer all day everyday.  I should mention here that I'm a Disabled veteran.  I also have PTSD, Major depression, anxiety.  

I use some sort of substance on a daily basis.  If I don't have drugs, or alcohol or weed, it's coffee non stop until my head hurts.  I always need something in my body that changes how I feel. 

So, I got home and I called the treatment center.  He was concerned about me,  and wasn't prepared for the curve ball.  To be honest, I didn't even think of the consequences, the logistics of any of it.  How it would effect me getting into treatment.  I just wanted to go home.  And so I did.  I run, basically anytime I feel uncomfortable, I run. 

So, he was concerned, and he said he'll have to do some talking to his clinical staff about my situation, but that I should still be fine to enter their house tomorrow.  I know a lot of people would do unthinkable things to be in my position.  I'm trying to be grateful.  I'm trying to not fuck this up.  I'm trying not to run, or I really in this case, isolate.  

How in the fuck can I manage doing all this treatment stuff... They keep you fucking busy for 3 months.  It's a huge opportunity and I don't feel ready.  

I never gotten past step 4, but I've been going to meetings lately.  At least 4 a week.  I had a sponsor, but I haven't called him in a week.  Idk.  I feel overwhelmed and scared.  

So, is it worth it?  I mean, I know if I put in the work, of course it will be worth it.  But what is actual recovery like?  Can I really have a life I can only dream of? 

Please help me, I am in desperate need of motivation.  Thanks for letting me share.  ",1,1771223520.0,alcoholicsanonymous,2,1.0,False

It was great and I really needed it. I think girls sometimes just need girl time to sort of rejuvenate themselves lol. Don’t get me wrong, i definitely like my alone time and use it wisely. But if you have someone close to you, you know how healing it is to just exist and have fun with them. It’s also a reminder to me that I do have people outside of my boyfriend who care and love me. 

We got my favorite coffee which is called an ‘island boy’ and it’s just chocolate, coconut and macadamia nut. It’s so good, I really needed to recreate it home to save money and to save myself the grief of not being able to have it. Then we went to a Japanese restaurant, which I’ve been wanting to try out since I found out about it. It’s super cute. The food was mid, came out kind of room temp unfortunately but the Thai tea was delicioussss. My friend had a vegetable ramen, I had the omurice. 

I came home and we hung out at mines, walked around and then went back out for some retail therapy. (As in five and below lol). I got some cute little trinkets and a very cheap perfume that honestly smells and lasts a while, surprisingly. Cheap stuff some times can be really good. 

Anyways, despite all of that I’ve been feeling this void inside of my chest. It started pretty small but as the days pass by it grows. I feel weird. Not really sure what’s going on, maybe it’s one of those episodes I get every few months where I’m depressed for no reason. I really hope that’s not the case because every time becomes worse than the last and I really don’t want to feel empty anymore, I try to snatch onto whatever feeling I can and it becomes a problem. 

Maybe it’s not though. Maybe it’s just me being alone because my boyfriend’s out of time and I just miss him lol, now that makes more sense.

I live in a red state but this place is very progressive, as most coffee shops tend to be. Still, any good workplace can get bad eggs.

Well I've been working with this young military brat for a little over a year. I was ok with her at first even tho she was clearly fighting internalized homophobia (she has had a girlfriend before but now insists that she's straight even tho she still dresses very masc). But recently, she reported a trans woman coworker and friend of mine for saying something when the Charlie Kirk incident happened. This friend was investigated and was terrified of losing her job. 

Thankfully she didn't get fired, bc she had actually just transferred from a store where one of her friends there died to gun violence just a few months earlier. So the HR rep basically said to just stop talking about the topics as people obviously had personal trauma surrounding the issue.

This military brat girl has off and on said homophobic things. But last weekend out of nowhere she YELLS ""seig heil"" while we're breaking things down to close. I was fucking shocked so I laughed it off in the moment. But when I told my trans friend about it, we both agreed to report it and I gave a witness statement. ESPECIALLY since this girl had said before that her father had told her to ""be careful"" because he was ""afraid"" that the ""crazy trans woman"" was going to shoot her (no this incident was not reported for some reason, I think bc the witness the girl said this to didn't want to file it officially - I guess maybe they didn't want to get personally involved).

Turns out this girl had also approached a bisexual cis guy coworker that same night and straight up told him that she was ""lowkey transphobic"" because the trans woman coworker was ""always acting aggressive towards her"".

Anyways. People are already whispering that it's confirmed that ""someone"" is getting fired this week. And there's nobody else we can think of who's getting the ax. I honestly wasn't really expecting that just bc this is the first time she was ever reported to HR here. Although I suppose her reporting a trans woman looks pretty bad with all of this on the table now.

Anyways, it feels good to be backed up. I am not sure if this girl knows that I'm a trans man bc I pass, but am out to most of my coworkers. I tend to assume that people know but she's generally nice to me so honestly I don't think she's heard through the grapevine.

I take omeprazole in the mornings and famotidine at night. Like some of you I was hesitant to do it but I tried improving my diet by quitting coffee and anything that would make it ‘better’ in terms of less acidity and it did nothing. In fact, quite a few foods make it worse. Bread, kale, apples, some soups… literally anything healthy actually seemed to make it much worse which is both bizarre and extremely annoying. The one thing that has helped has been taking a PPI and famotidine and of course, good old Gaviscon Advance.

So even though these things have helped, of course I’m not trying to just medicate with this stuff forever. Does anyone else have this experience of pretty much nothing helping BUT meds?

I don’t know, but I am definitely in physical crisis. I received Cortizone shots in my knees. The left knee is fine. The right knee, however has become nonfunctional mostly after the Cortizone shot. It was swollen so much that it was actually holding the bone in place. I had no idea how bad my knee was before the shot. Now every time I walk my knee clicks and grinds, because there’s no fluid holding the bones apart. I have an appointment with my orthopedic surgeon to get fitted for a brace soon. 

I realized today, how bad my knee is, and it’s worst than I thought. I knew it was bad before today but I didn’t know it was this bad.

I went to Church and I had to walk a block, which used to be nothing for me. I literally got out of breath from the pain in my knee. 

It was cold outside in Pittsburgh, and I honestly thought about just sitting down on the ground right then and there due to the pain being unbearable. That’s when I realize why my Orthopedic surgeon was telling me that I will probably be in a wheelchair within a year without surgery.

I had to go get groceries after church and drive home. The electric buggy kept stopping and jerking my back, which also has osteoarthritis in it and it’s really bad too. In addition to this, some weird guy kept passing me in the store every five seconds and was starting to really annoy me because every time he went by me, he would say something. I already get disorientated in stores with too much going on.

So I get up to the cash register and my bank card won’t work. My other bank card won’t work because they’re ATM machine card reader machine is broken. The cashier tried to help but was not successful. So eventually, I got the ideal to transfer money from one card to the other and to use my Walmart app to pay.

That took over an hour. I got into a hyper focus on fixing the issue instead of just saying you know what keep the groceries. I’m going home..

I get home, and as I’m coming through the door with my knee clicking, no less, my coffee dumps all over the floor. And I’m out of towels because my washer broke and I have not been able to make it to the laundromat. So I think I’ll just leave it for now. I come in. I let my dog out. I take my shoes and socks off, and walked to put away groceries, and my bone is sliding back-and-forth in my knee socket, and I almost fall.

Then I get my roller walker that has four wheels and put everything in it to put my groceries away.

I finally get everything put away and then I have to find something to clean up the coffee that spilt. The meanwhile, my dogs trying to look up the coffee, of course, and I’m having to argue and fight with her over that.

I finally get everything cleaned up and put away and the pizza I put in the air fryer burnt.

Then my dog’s whining for the freaking coffee still thinking that it’s on the floor for whatever reason cause I put a chair in her way so she couldn’t get into the kitchen. She’s a really big dog. And she’s whining, whining, whining, whining, whining, whining, whining, and at that point, I lose my shit and I yell at her to get out and to give me my space and leave me alone. I yelled at her. I need alone time with a few cuss words in there.

So here I am sitting alone, because I live alone and I’m 2800 miles away from my family and friends, and I’m having to go through all of this by myself. 

Earlier this week, I had a meltdown and said some horrible things to my son and told him I disowned him because for the last three months, he has been trying to rewrite the history of what he did concerning his wedding three years ago. I have no idea why he’s bringing it up now after three years. I originally was not invited to it. Then he told me he had to argue with his wife to put me on the guest list, by the time I was reinvited, I had Covid and a lower respiratory infection in my lungs, so needless to say I was very sick. I was reinvited a week before the wedding at which point I had not saved any money to go, and I was sick.

Then he tries to rewrite the history and said that he never said I was not invited at first that I was always invited and that he never said that I couldn’t stay at the resort where everybody else was. Then he says that he didn’t remember seeing it. And I said I do because it was very traumatic for me and it hurt me really bad. I said not only did you say I couldn’t stay at the resort, but you also said the nearest hotel was 50 miles away and you asked me to watch the grandbabies while you guys got married. 

And I had asked him why his wife stopped talking to me he told me because she was upset with me over what I had said about the wedding. And I’m like what did I say about the wedding other than the truth and why couldn’t she just talk to me about it? And he said well I told her what you said about the wedding, and I said you mean what you asked me about the wedding.

Then he gets home and goes inside of his house and his family is there and his wife, and he says well I don’t know how you thought this was gonna turn out well for you mother. So I hung up on him. I blocked him and blocked him off for all my social media and everything else.

I blew up and said a lot of horrible things that I should not have said because I was bawling and crying and freaking out that he was trying to convince me the things didn’t happen the way they did, basically he was trying to rewrite history and gaslight me.

So I texted him and all of my other children in the chat the family chat posted documentation of what he had said before, and I was so upset that I disowned him.

It’s been about a week and I still have not called to apologize for my words, because I don’t want him to think that he can just I don’t know how to explain it. I don’t want him to think his actions are OK because I apologize and I’m not ready to have him in my life at this time. For the last three months, he has been verbally abusing me by trying to rewrite the history of what happened three years ago. I don’t allow people like that in my life no matter who they are and if he’s going to treat me like that, I’m not gonna allow him access to me.

I mean, there were other things that went wrong today too, but I’m not going to go into great details. But here I am having another meltdown, and before the last few months, I haven’t had one in years, maybe two or three years, and before that it had been maybe 10 years. The reason I had one about two or three years ago was because I found out my husband was cheating on me and was watching CSAM online and now I’m getting a divorce. That’s why I moved all the way across the country because of my husband.

I’m alone and I don’t have family or friends here and I can’t move because I can’t sell my house right now. I’m trying to work every day and I just had to pay over $1000 because my utilities were three months behind and getting or going to be shut off. So I had to work overtime on a bad knee to pay everything.

I know if I was Neurotypical this would all be bothering me, but I don’t think it would be as hard. I’m lost. I don’t know what to do and I don’t know how to stop these meltdowns from happening and if you have any idea how to stop yours will you share it with me because I swear I’m about ready to break again.

In addition to the stuff, I’m also having to deal with the adjuster on my house due to storm damage. And he was weird. I asked him not to put me in the pictures, and I moved it out of the way and he waited till I went back into the room or looking out the window and took the pictures with me in them. That’s weird. 

I have an appointment with my therapist on Wednesday.

However after being bored for some time i could feel a drive to be productive... weird part though I had a bunch of random thoughts of doing stupid things I've never done or never would?

My mind is slowly calming back down to wherever it should be and not where it was before(idk what happened, but I kept picking at my skin and it felt like everything gave me a dopamine rush like it was weird and I think i just dysregulated myself there.)

I fell in love with my friend “Sarah” last year. She’s in a long-distance relationship, so as soon as I realized my feelings, I tried really hard to fall out of love with her. I’ve always been the kind of person who just tells people when I have feelings for them, but with her I can’t. And it’s making me miserable.

We live close to each other and share a few hobbies, so we spend a lot of our free time together. I’m pretty sure she can tell I have feelings for her. I do small things for her like bringing her coffees or pastries when she’s in a bad mood and I know that’s not exactly “just friend” behavior.

I know I probably need to take a step back. But I can’t just go no contact, there’s no logical reason I can give her, and it would feel dramatic and suspicious. I also can’t confess, because she has a girlfriend and I don’t want to make things awkward or jeopardize the friendship.

I’ve started journaling, trying to process everything, but honestly it hasn’t helped at all. I just feel stuck between wanting to distance myself and spend my days with her.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do you move on when you can’t confess and can’t fully walk away? What things I should be doing without making her suspicious?

There is an old man at my apartment gym who I’ve been seeing for few months now. He is always walking on the treadmill. He has to be Medicare eligible minimum.

I (31F) use the gym very regularly, but I have never spoken to him until one day he was getting ready to leave, and I was standing on my treadmill.  he came from my side, and lightly tapped my elbow and started talking to me.

He told me he’s been seeing me around the gym for very long and repeatedly saying he’s not trying to be weird, and that he is just a very social person and he talks to everybody, has already introduced himself to many people outside the gym like at the pool area. Then he told me he recently retired as a teacher, he has been seeing me work really hard at the gym, and I seem very confident and fit. Just wanted to say hello. I I am a naturally desperate people pleaser, so I smiled and worked to appear welcoming, thanked him for approaching me,

jokingly told him I must be pretending confidence really well, probably a vulnerability I shouldn’t have shared so early.

He mentioned his daughter lives nearby that niece lives nearby, blah blah blah. Asked me what I do for work. I hate that I told him about my job and my recent injury that I was doing rehab for. I don’t usually share private things so early, let my guard down so easily, but he just posed himself as the type of person who says hello to everybody so I felt it as harmless.

A few days later, he saw me at the gym again and did the same thing. Came up from behind me and tapped me on the elbow, I took my headphones off, he asked me how my weekend was, he was standing really close to me, as I walked on the treadmill, i talked and answered and noticed he stared at my boobs(I think?) while I was distracted talking. Then he asked me “did you run a marathon over the weekend” as he did a full staring of my body. I was wearing very tight leggings And shirt, and I felt a little uneasy as he stared. Then he wraps conversation and said “listen if you ever wanna grab coffee or a bite, just let me know “ and heads out.

Am I overthinking it or is he romantically interested? The reason I feel I could be overthinking it is because he is so so so much older than me like I could be his daughter‘s age and he mentioned his daughter and nieces too. Should I get coffee with him since it’s probably harmless? Or is he expecting a date?

Also, if I say no, how do I deal with continuing to see him at gym?  This is our apartment gym.",2,1771221279.0,askanything,11,0.75,False

After taking some time to process my emotions, I decided to confront him. I was nervous and, but I knew I had to do it. I asked him to meet me at a coffee shop, and I laid everything out on the table. I showed him the evidence I had found, and I told him how much he had hurt me. At first, he tried to deny it, but I knew he was lying. I told him that I wanted him to be honest with me, and that's when he admitted to everything. He said he was sorry and that he never meant to hurt me. I don't know what the future holds for us, but I do know that I deserve honesty and respect.

I've been this way for eight years and nothing will change my mind so don't even try and I started that before I realize I had a bunch of sensitivities

So i call them sensitivities cause they're not allergies but also i get bloated, get constipated or get diarrhea, get rashes, have SEVERE brain fog to the point that I can't hold a thought for longer than five seconds, and I'm in so much pain and absolutely exhausted for three days after I eat whatever I can't eat

I can't eat soy, gluten, cows milk, gost milk, oats, coffee, and eggs. 

A lot of things that are vegetarian have soy and then the things that don't have gluten or egg or dairy. 

I just wanted to go out for a nice dinner with my boyfriend for valentine's day and I was looking at menus (as i have to do every single time I go anywhere) and I couldn't eat a single thing in their menu. I tried to look at some more places and I also couldn't eat much there. If it's not the food itself, it's the sauce, and if it's not the sauce it's some other things. 

And I can't exactly ask restaurants what the ingredients are to everything that they use because for one they look at me like I have fifteen eyes or they just genuinely don't understand what i'm asking. It's decently easy to explain the gluten but then how am I supposed to explain that I can't eat seven things AND i'm pescatarian by choice. People just can't fathom it. 

Going over to people's houses or them making me something is impossible. If someone in my life dies and a friend or someone tries to make me condolences cookies or pastries i just have to give them to someone else and pretend i ate it and thank them so much. 

Not to mention it drives people absolutely nuts when we're trying to go out and i hate being that person but what am I supposed to do? I didn't ask for this and yeah sure I've learned a lot from it but I genuinely will tell people to assume I just can't eat whatever they want me to eat because it's that bad. 

I can cook for myself perfectly fine though, but it's hard when you wanna go out or don't have the kitchen to cook for yourself or go out of state or something. ",2,1771220588.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False

1r61ar0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1r61ar0/the_real_benefit_of_ginseng_coffee_in_everyday/,The Real Benefit of Ginseng Coffee in Everyday Life,"Most people in Mumbai wake up and reach for coffee without thinking twice. It is the quick way to shake off sleep and face the day. Lately though more locals have started choosing ginseng coffee instead. The switch happens because this blend keeps everything good about coffee while adding a natural layer of support from ginseng. The [benefit of ginseng coffee](https://wellgincoffee.com/blogs/korean-ginseng-coffee-for-energy) shows up in how it delivers energy that feels even and steady rather than sharp and short-lived.

Ginseng comes from traditional practices where it has been used for generations to help the body cope with daily demands. Mixed into quality coffee it creates a drink that lifts you gently and holds the energy longer. In a city full of long train rides crowded roads and nonstop work this kind of calm boost makes a noticeable difference. Wellgin Coffee crafts their version with robust Robusta beans and selected Korean ginseng so the flavor stays rich and satisfying.

# Clearer Focus and Sharper Days with Ginseng Coffee

The benefit of ginseng coffee often appears first in better mental clarity. Many people say their thoughts stay organized longer and distractions do not pull them away as easily. Whether you sit in meetings handle projects or study late this sharper focus helps get more done without the usual mental drain. In the busy pace of Maharashtra that extra mental edge becomes something people look forward to each morning.

Another part of the benefit of ginseng coffee is the way it supports balance under pressure. Ginseng works as an adaptogen which simply means it helps the body adjust naturally when things get tough. Paired with coffee the result is energy that feels grounded and less likely to turn into restlessness. Afternoon slumps become less common and people find themselves staying productive longer.

# Supporting Immunity and Overall Strength

Health perks also draw people to this blend. The benefit of ginseng coffee includes quiet help for the immune system through the antioxidants ginseng naturally provides. Mumbai life brings dust pollution changing weather and close contact in public spaces so anything that strengthens defenses feels welcome. A regular cup can play a small but steady role in keeping minor issues at bay.

Some notice steadier energy after meals too. The benefit of ginseng coffee seems to encourage more balanced blood sugar which avoids those heavy tired moments that follow eating. With street food chai stalls and home-cooked meals all around this gentle support fits right into daily eating habits.

# Building Stamina and Simple Routines

People who stay active appreciate how the benefit of ginseng coffee helps with endurance. Long walks through the city gym sessions or even carrying groceries up stairs feel a bit easier and recovery happens faster. It slips into movement routines without overwhelming the system which makes it practical for everyday use.

# Easy to Make and Enjoy Every Day

Getting started takes almost no effort with Wellgin Coffee sachets. Just add hot water stir briefly and the cup is ready. That quick preparation suits rushed mornings office breaks or quick afternoons at home. Convenience like this helps people stay consistent long enough to truly experience the benefit of ginseng coffee.

Over time the habit settles in comfortably. Regular coffee starts to feel plain compared to this version that energizes while quietly supporting the body. The smooth roasted taste combined with lasting effects keeps it enjoyable day after day.

In the end ginseng coffee brings a small but meaningful upgrade to daily life. The benefit of ginseng coffee lies in steadier energy clearer thinking better balance and gentle wellness support. For anyone in Mumbai wanting to feel more consistent and ready each day Wellgin Coffee offers a blend that is easy to love. One simple cup can quietly change how the morning unfolds.",0,1771220419.0,IndiaCoffee,3,0.22,False

I was romantically interested a work colleague of mine who I got along very well with. 

for a little bit of context her and I met at work(obviously) but we only started talking to each other until after she accidentally hit my personal vehicle with a company vehicle in the parking lot. 

We started talking and I found that her and I got along very well. The conversations flowed naturally and there definitely was a strong connection. Even though her and I had opposite interests the conversations lasted a long time. I will say she has a very bubbly personality and she is a genuinely kind person, however Im not completely oblivious when someone is actively flirting with me. so fast forward a few months she announced to everyone that she will be turning in her 2 weeks to go work at a new job and move out of town. The place she moved to is actually where I live, I do a daily 45 ish minute commute to work. So eventually I work up the courage to ask her if she'd like to stay in touch and grab some coffee or hangout sometime after she leaves. she agrees however she mentions that she has a boyfriend. she had never mentioned this before so naturally it confuses me but regardless she gives me her number number and I leave the conversation at that 

eventually we start to make plans to hangout with each other but then she texts me "" I really appreciate getting to know you but I feel that things can look complicated in regards to female and male friend ships  I think remaining friends on a personal level will be complicated. it's been really nice getting to know you but I think out of respect for all of us some boundaries need to be put in place"" note: she sends me this after telling me in person after I asked her to hangout that ""it's not inappropriate for friends to hangout or keep in touch"" 

After I just simply text her that ""I of course am more than willing to respect her boundaries and there will be no issue there, if she ever needs anything or needs someone to talk to I'm only one call away ""  and haven't talked to her since (this happened on Thursday)

for me it really sucks cause I would have loved to date her but I'm not the type to interject one someone else's relationship, and I really wanted to maintain our friendship because she's the type of person you want as a friend .  I'm really struggling with the idea of potentially never being able to see her again cause I really care about her. The pain I feel is a lot more different then previous pain I've felt with when it comes to rejection I've had previously.

My fasting is never below like 94 but tends to average more around 100 even taking 26 units of insulin overnight … and my post breakfast numbers are always high even with 20 units of insulin.

Here's what I learned.","# I trained a custom model to detect PDF form fields better than Reducto. 12,000+ forms filled, $0 marketing. Here's what I learned.

https://reddit.com/link/1r615v7/video/yg6bmr1bmsjg1/player

TL;DR: Built AutoFillPDF — paste your info, upload a form, AI fills every field automatically. 97% accuracy. I trained a custom field detection model that outperforms every research or commercial API I benchmarked, including Reducto.

Free to start, no signup required. 12,000+ forms filled so far, entirely organic growth.

**The Problem I Was Solving**

I was filling out the same tax and insurance forms over and over for different clients. Name, address, EIN, policy number — the same 30 fields, different PDF every time.

Every existing solution was either:

* Manual (click each field, type, repeat 30x)
* Enterprise pricing ($50-200/month for Adobe or DocuSign)
* Required uploading to some random cloud service
* ""AI-powered"" but really just OCR that misses half the fields

I just wanted to paste my info and have the form filled. That's it.

So I built AutoFillPDF.

**My Background (and why PDFs were a cakewalk)**

Before this I was deep in computer vision — the kind where getting your model wrong means a car drives into a wall. Self-driving perception, object detection, the whole stack.

When I looked at the PDF form detection problem, I almost laughed. Compared to detecting a pedestrian at 70mph in rain at night, finding a text field on a white page with clear boundaries is trivial. The domain is incredibly constrained: fixed layouts, high contrast, predictable structures.

But here's the thing — nobody had really *tried*. The existing commercial APIs (Reducto, Adobe, etc.) treat PDF field detection as a secondary feature. They're good enough for simple fillable forms, but they fall apart on:

* Flat/static PDFs (no embedded form fields, just text and lines)
* Scanned forms with noise, skew, or compression artifacts
* Dense multi-column layouts
* Forms with unusual field types (checkboxes inside tables, signature lines, date fields with separator slashes)

So I trained my own model. And it turned out to be one of the most important decisions I made.

**Training the Field Detection Model**

I used RF-DETR (detection transformer) as the base architecture and fine-tuned on a dataset I built from thousands of real-world PDF forms — W-9s, insurance applications, employment docs, government forms, you name it.

The model itself wasn't the hard part. **The augmentations were everything.**

Standard image augmentations (rotation, scale, crop) barely moved the needle. What actually mattered were **document-specific augmentations:**

* **Ink blotting** — simulating printer smudges, pen marks, coffee stains. Real scanned forms are dirty. If your model only trains on clean renders, it chokes on real-world scans
* **Compression artifacts** — JPEG quality degradation at various levels. People scan forms at wildly different quality settings
* **Skew and warp** — slight rotation and perspective distortion from flatbed scanners and phone cameras
* **Background noise** — paper texture, fold creases, staple shadows
* **Font/layout variation** — rendering the same form structure with different fonts, spacing, and field sizes

These domain-specific augmentations were the difference between ""works on clean test data"" and ""works on the crumpled W-9 someone photographed on their kitchen table.""

**Results:** My model outperforms Reducto's field detection API on every benchmark I ran — especially on flat/non-fillable PDFs and scanned documents, where the accuracy gap is significant. On clean fillable forms everyone's roughly equal. On messy real-world forms, it's not close.

If you've worked in CV you know the pattern: the model architecture matters way less than the data pipeline and augmentation strategy. That was true in self-driving and it's true in document AI.

**How It Works (the simple version)**

1. Upload any PDF form
2. Paste your information (plain text — resume, client details, whatever)
3. AI detects every field (even on flat/scanned PDFs), matches your data to the right fields
4. Download your filled PDF in 3 seconds

No templates. No field mapping. No training. It just works.

The AI understands context. If a form asks for ""Employer Identification Number"" and your text says ""EIN: 12-3456789"", it figures it out. If a field says ""Date of Birth"" and you wrote ""born March 15, 1990"", it fills in 03/15/1990 in the right format.

**What Makes It Different**

**Custom-trained detection model:** Not using off-the-shelf OCR or commercial APIs. My model is purpose-built for form field detection and outperforms everything I've benchmarked.

**Works on ANY PDF:** Fillable forms, flat/static forms, scanned forms — doesn't matter. Most tools only handle fillable PDFs. The custom model is what makes the hard cases work.

**Speed:** 3 seconds per page. Detection + filling + rendering.

**Zero friction:** No account required for first 3 pages. No credit card. No email. Upload and go.

**Pricing:** Credits, not subscriptions.

* Free: 3 pages (no signup)
* Pro: $15/month for 100 credits
* API: $0.10/page for developers

**The Growth (What Actually Worked)**

**What flopped:**

* Product Hunt: Some upvotes, zero sustained traffic
* Cold outreach: Emailed 50 insurance agents. 2 replies. Both said ""we already have a process""
* Twitter/X: 5-10 likes per post. Crickets
* Paid ads: Tested $100 on Google Ads. ""Fill pdf"" keywords are $3-5/click. Burned through it in 2 days

**What worked:**

* **SEO content:** Guides targeting specific pain points — ""how to fill out a W-9 online,"" ""convert static PDF to fillable,"" ""AI PDF field detection."" 30,000 impressions/month from Google now
* **Reddit (organic):** Being genuinely helpful in threads about PDF tools. Not dropping links — solving problems
* **No-signup free tier:** Single best growth decision. People try it instantly, it works, they come back
* **API for developers:** Didn't expect this — devs started integrating it into their own apps. Insurance tech, HR tools, legal platforms. \~15% of usage now comes through the API

**The pattern:** Nobody wants to hear about your product. They want their problem solved. No-signup free tier lets them solve the problem first, discover the product second.

**Technical Details**

**Stack:**

* Next.js + React frontend
* Custom RF-DETR model for field detection
* OpenAI GPT for data-to-field matching and format inference
* pdf-lib for PDF manipulation
* Neon Postgres + Drizzle ORM
* Stripe for credit-based billing

**The hard problems:**

1. **Field detection on flat PDFs** — Solved with the custom model. This is the core differentiator. Commercial APIs treat this as an edge case; I treat it as the primary use case
2. **Format matching** — Date fields want MM/DD/YYYY or DD-Mon-YY. Phones: (555) 123-4567 vs 5551234567. The AI infers format per field
3. **Multi-page context** — Page 3 references ""Applicant Name"" from page 1. System maintains context across the full document
4. **Flat PDF writing** — Placing text at exact coordinates while matching font size, alignment, and spacing. The positioning math is nontrivial

**Trade-offs I made:**

* No handwriting/signature generation (use a separate tool)
* No bulk batch in the UI (API only)
* English-first (other languages work but accuracy drops \~10%)

90% of users just need to fill a form fast. I optimized for that.

**What I Learned**

**1. Domain expertise transfers more than people think**

CV skills from self-driving → document AI was almost unfairly easy. The fundamental techniques (detection transformers, augmentation strategy, data pipeline engineering) transfer directly. The domain is just way more constrained. If you have ML experience in a hard domain, look for easier domains where nobody's really tried.

**2. Augmentations > architecture**

I could have spent months designing a novel architecture. Instead I used an off-the-shelf detection transformer and spent my time on document-specific augmentations. Ink blotting alone improved accuracy on scanned forms by 12%. The data pipeline is always the moat, not the model.

**3. ""No signup"" is a superpower**

I almost didn't do this. Every SaaS playbook says capture emails. But removing signup entirely means people *use* the product. Visitor → form filled conversion is 34%. Most SaaS tools are at 2-5%.

**4. Specific > generic for SEO**

""AI PDF tool"" = impossible to rank. ""How to fill out a W-9 form online free"" = page 1 in 3 weeks. 50+ guides targeting hyper-specific queries. Each brings 10-30 visitors per day. Adds up.

**5. Developers are an underrated channel**

Added an API as an afterthought. Turns out tons of small SaaS products need PDF filling as a *feature*. Insurance tech, HR tools, legal platforms. They don't want to build it — they want an endpoint. $0.10/page is a no-brainer.

**6. The ""boring"" problem is the right problem**

PDF form filling is boring. Nobody's excited about it. That's exactly why it works — big companies ignore it, but millions of people do it every day.

**Current Stats**

* 12,000+ forms filled
* 30,000 Google impressions/month (climbing)
* \~400 organic clicks/month from search
* Solo developer
* Zero marketing budget

**What's Next**

* Batch processing in the UI
* Better scanned/image-based PDF support (leveraging the model further)
* Multi-language improvements
* Form templates (save your info, reuse across forms)
* Integrations

**Try It**

The dust has settled on another Union Budget, and if you were expecting a massive overhaul of the tax slabs or a “gift” for the middle class, you might feel a bit underwhelmed.

However, as they say in finance, the devil is in the details.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget 2026 wasn’t about splashy headlines; it was about refinement, simplification, and a gentle nudge. The government is essentially saying: ""We’ve built the new tax regime; now we’re going to make sure you use it while we clean up the loopholes elsewhere.""

From a ""hidden"" tax on your favourite gold bonds to making your F&O (Futures & Options) trades a bit more expensive, there’s a lot to unpack. So, grab a coffee, and let’s look at what Budget 2026 means for your wallet.

**1. Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB): Tax Exemption Tightened**

We at Vrid previously highlighted **Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)** as the most efficient way to invest in gold. When the RBI issued these bonds in periodic tranches, they offered a unique trifecta of benefits: a 2.5% annual interest, government backing, and a massive tax advantage.

The rule was simple: if you held an SGB until its 8-year maturity, all capital gains were tax-exempt. This applied regardless of whether you bought during the original issuance from RBI or later on the secondary market (BSE/NSE). As long as you were the one holding the bond at redemption, you paid zero tax.

**But Budget 2026 has changed the locks on this door.**

The new budget has now restricted the maturity tax exemption to original subscribers only.

* **Original (Primary) Buyers:** Your tax-free status at maturity remains protected.
* **Secondary Market Buyers:** If you bought your SGB on an exchange, you are no longer eligible for the redemption tax exemption. When your bond matures, your gains will be treated as taxable capital gains (likely at 12.5% LTCG).

We discuss in greater detail [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFinanceHub/comments/1qtnw5l/why_your_sgb_premiums_are_crashing_for_last_two/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) why the government is willing to go this far, risking a loss of investor confidence.

**2. STT Hike on Derivatives: Trading F&O Just Got Costlier**

If you spend your mornings watching green and red candles on a trading screen, this one hurts.

The government has been increasingly vocal about the ""F&O frenzy"" in India. With millions of **retail traders** losing money in derivatives, the Finance Minister decided to pull the handbrake by hiking the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on derivatives.

* **Futures:** The STT has jumped from 0.02% to 0.05%. That’s a 150% increase!
* **Options Premium:** The STT on the sale of options (premium) has risen from 0.10% to 0.15%. That’s a 50% jump!
* **Options Exercise:** STT increased from 0.125% to 0.15% (20% jump)

**Why does this matter?**

On a single trade, it might look like a few extra rupees. But for active traders who churn their portfolios daily, this is a massive increase in the ""cost of doing business."" It reduces the net profit and makes high-frequency trading significantly more expensive.

The message is loud and clear: The government wants you to be an investor, not a gambler. By increasing the friction in F&O trading, they are hoping to push retail money toward more stable avenues like Mutual Fund **SIPs**.

**3. The New Income Tax Act & Slab Stability** 

One of the biggest announcements wasn't a rate change, but a structural one. The government is rolling out the New Income Tax Act, 2025, effective from April 1, 2026. The goal? To replace the archaic laws from 1961 with something simpler.

As for the tax slabs themselves, the Finance Minister played it safe. There were no changes to the rates, but let’s refresh what the New Tax Regime (which is now the default) looks like for FY 2026-27:

https://preview.redd.it/11u5kawjrpjg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0363865104c1c2c86d4205007c0a13ead96ccd66

These new slabs under the new tax regime are designed to reduce the tax burden on middle-class taxpayers.

Individuals earning up to ₹12,75,000 annually will not pay income tax because of an increased rebate under Section 87A, which has been raised to ₹60,000 and the standard deduction of ₹75,000.

Read [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFinanceHub/comments/1jch7fl/budget_2025_new_income_tax_bill_all_key_changes/) to learn more about the New Income Tax Act, 2025.

**4. Share Buybacks: Taxed as Capital Gains**

Earlier, share buyback proceeds were treated like a dividend, which was taxed at slab rates. 

And now, share buybacks will be taxed as capital gains for all shareholders. Treating buybacks as capital gains brings clarity and lowers tax for retail investors who pay lower capital-gains rates than their slab rates.

The Budget also imposes an additional buyback tax on promoters (making the effective promoter tax \~22% for corporate promoters and 30% for non-corporate promoters). The overall aim: remove tax arbitrage and benefit ordinary shareholders.

**5. STT Hike Ripple Effects On Arbitrage Funds**

The STT increase on derivatives will have a direct impact on mutual funds that use derivatives ([**arbitrage funds**](https://blog.vrid.in/2023/10/24/what-is-an-arbitrage-fund-is-it-suitable-for-short-term-investments-for-you/), equity hedged funds).

Arbitrage and funds that rely heavily on futures/options will see higher trading costs and may report slightly lower net returns or higher turnover costs.

Experts estimate arbitrage fund returns will drop by 0.25-0.30% annually because of higher STT.

**Why does this matter?** 

Many retail investors choose arbitrage funds when they want equity-like returns with lower volatility or **short-term parking**. If the fund’s strategy depends on heavy F&O usage, the STT hike reduces the margin of return.

**6. Travel & Education: A TCS Relief**

If you’re planning a master's degree abroad or a vacation to Europe, there’s some genuinely good news. The Tax Collected at Source (TCS) rates have been ""rationalised.""

Previously, for overseas tour packages or remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), you could be hit with a 20% TCS if you crossed a certain limit. While you could claim this back when filing your ITR, it was a massive drain on immediate liquidity.

Budget 2026 has slashed the TCS on foreign education, medical treatment, and overseas tour packages to a flat 2%.

This is a huge win for cash flow. Instead of the bank ""locking up"" 20% of your travel budget, they’ll only take 2%. It’s your money, and you get to keep it in your pocket throughout the year rather than waiting for a tax refund months later.

**7. Other Smaller Changes**

* **Foreign Asset Disclosure:** If you’re a student or a young pro who worked abroad and forgot to declare a small foreign bank account or asset, the government has launched a 6-month one-time disclosure scheme. You can come clean, pay a nominal fee/tax, and avoid the heavy penalties of the Black Money Act.
* **Revised ITRs:** You now have until March 31 (instead of December 31) to revise your tax returns, provided you pay a small fee. This gives you three extra months to fix those ""Oops, I forgot that 10-rupee interest from my savings account"" mistakes.
* **Motor Accident Compensation is Tax-Free:** If you received compensation from a Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, the interest on that amount is now tax-free. No TDS either.
* **Customs Duty on Personal Imports Slashed:** Bringing gadgets or gifts from abroad? The budget halves customs duty on personal imports to 10%, a uniform rate including gifts.

**Final Thoughts**

Budget 2026 was more about fine-tuning than sweeping change. For most retail readers, your day-to-day budgeting and core investment decisions need no overhaul.

The meaningful shifts are directional: the government wants to cool speculative F&O action, close tax arbitrage (buybacks), and tighten the tax treatment of secondary-market SGBs.

So, don’t panic. Do update your calculations where relevant (especially if you trade derivatives or hold SGBs bought on exchange).

Small rule changes, repeated over time, can change portfolios, but the fundamentals of good personal finance (emergency fund, diversified investing, long-term discipline) remain the same.",2,1771219837.0,IndianFinanceHub,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

With just one day left before the wedding, I was rummaging through a cabinet when I came across a piece of 

paper. 

It was the marriage certificate of Harrison Ford and his childhood friend. 

I immediately snapped a photo and sent it to him: \[Explain this\] 

I thought it was just a prank, but almost instantly, a voice message came through, “Emily, I’m really sorry. Last night at the bar, it was just a joke. I got drunk with Harrison and we went ahead and filed the certificate.” 

“Don’t worry. After the divorce cooling-off period, we’ll go through with it immediately.” 

“I’ll absolutely give him back to you.” 

I was silent for two seconds, then blocked his account. 

Three hours later, Harrison returned home. I happened to be rolling my suitcase down the stairs. 

He glanced at the paper on the coffee table and pinched the bridge of his nose. 

“Such a trivial thing… she was just being playful. Why hold on so tightly?” 

“You’ve waited six years for this wedding. Can’t even wait a month?” 

I smiled faintly, not denying it. “Yes, I can’t wait.” 

Harrison froze for a moment. 

Instinctively, he stepped in front of me. “Emily, don’t make a scene.” 

“The invitations are already sent out. If you leave now, how are the families supposed to handle it?” 

I pushed his hand aside and kept moving toward the door. 

His voice finally sank. “You’d destroy six years of our relationship over this little thing?” 

I stopped and turned to look at him. “Six years?” 

“Harrison, when you filed that certificate with her… did you even think about six years?” 

He was speechless. 

Finally, he forced out a half-hearted explanation.

“The bar was chaotic. My friends kept pouring me drinks. She tried to shield me a lot, but she was dizzy too.” 

“There were too many instigators… we got carried away.” 

He paused, then lifted his eyes and returned to his usual calm, “It was just a joke. Correcting it fixes 

everything.” 

I looked at his indifferent face and found I had no desire to argue. 

A joke? If marriage can be a joke, what in this world is serious? 

As I turned away, his phone suddenly rang. 

He glanced at it. “It’s Chloe. She knows she messed up and wants to apologize…” 

I ignored him and opened the door. 

But Chloe was already standing outside. 

Short, sharp hair. Wearing a biker jacket. Juggling car keys in her hand. 

“Emily, you really going?” 

I dragged my suitcase around her. 

Chloe clicked her tongue and snatched the handle from me. 

“Is this necessary? I admitted my mistake, okay?” 

“I pushed him into filing it. I poured the drinks. Got a problem with that? Don’t take it out on Harrison.” 

Harrison came out from the doorway, frowning. 

“Chloe, be polite to Emily. Give her suitcase back.” 

Chloe didn’t budge. She pulled the suitcase closer to her.

“Give it back? Tomorrow at the wedding, are you gonna exchange rings with air?” 

She turned back to me, eyes challenging, “Emily, I’m nothing like you, orbiting a man all day with no life or career of my own.” 

“But I know a big boss like Harrison, business dinners and social games are normal.” 

She stepped closer, arrogance in her tone, “When we played in the mud bare-assed, when he got into fights and I helped him pick up bricks, where were you then?”

1r610vy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r610vy,Machine is under dosing [la specialista],"Hi everybody,

I recently bought a delonghi la specialista second hand. The dosing button was broken and the previous owner had glued it in place.

I replaced the button with a new one but i cant get the machine to give me a good dose off coffe grounds.

When the dosing button is at its lowest setting the grinder grinds for approx 5 seconds and at its highest setting 15seconds. This is with the x2 button luminated. But this will only give me around 9-10 grams off grounds.

I cleaned the grinder, removed the complete top cover and cleaned the whole machine while i replaced the buttons.

Can somebody tell me if i can do something else?

Beans are bought new at the supermarket.

Machine is descaled and water filter installed.

I reset the machine with the menu buttons.

Note this is the older model so i cant activate a extra grind option in the menu (correct me if im wrong)",2,1771219555.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False

Or maybe they're unavailable. Or maybe you just KNOW this crush is going nowhere but your brain won't get the memo. Welcome to one of the most frustrating human experiences ever.

Here's what nobody tells you: Your feelings aren't ""stupid"" or ""wrong."" Your brain is literally doing what evolution designed it to do, flooding you with dopamine and obsessive thoughts because that's how attraction works. I've spent months researching this from neuroscience papers, psychology podcasts, and talking to therapists. The truth? You're not weak for having these feelings. But you ARE in control of what you do next.

This isn't about ""just get over it"" bullshit. This is about rewiring your brain, one uncomfortable step at a time.

## Step 1: Cut the Fantasy Fuel (Stop the Mental Movies)

Your crush lives rent-free in your head because you keep replaying scenarios that will NEVER happen. You imagine conversations, dates, them suddenly realizing they're in love with you. Every time you do this, you're literally training your brain to crave them more.

**The fix:** Catch yourself mid-fantasy and STOP. Out loud, say ""nope"" and physically shake your head. Sounds dumb but it works. Your brain needs a pattern interrupt. Replace that mental movie with literally anything else. Recite song lyrics. Plan your grocery list. The content doesn't matter, breaking the loop does.

Dr. Helen Fisher's research on romantic love shows that obsessive thinking activates the same brain regions as cocaine addiction. You're essentially getting high on your own thoughts. Time to go cold turkey.

## Step 2: Delete, Block, Mute Everything

Social media is POISON when you're trying to move on. Every story, every post, every tagged photo is a hit of dopamine that keeps you hooked. You check their profile ""just once"" and boom, you're spiraling for the next two hours analyzing their lunch photo.

**Be ruthless:** Unfollow. Mute their stories. If you're really serious, block them temporarily. Delete old texts and photos. Yeah, it feels dramatic. Good. You need dramatic right now.

I recommend using the **Freedom app** to block specific websites and apps during vulnerable hours (late night, Sunday afternoons, whenever you typically stalk). Set it for 24-hour blocks so you can't cheat.

## Step 3: Get Angry (No, Seriously)

Sadness keeps you stuck. Anger moves you forward. Stop romanticizing this person. They're not perfect. They probably chew with their mouth open. They definitely have annoying habits. They hurt you by not choosing you.

Make a list of every single thing about them or the situation that pisses you off. Their terrible music taste. How they left you on read. The way they flirt with everyone. Read this list when you feel yourself slipping.

This isn't about becoming bitter. It's about balance. You've been putting them on a pedestal. Time to knock them off.

## Step 4: Starve the Crush (Zero Contact Rule)

You can't get over someone while still talking to them every day. Period. The ""let's stay friends"" thing? That's future you's problem. Right now, you need SPACE.

**No texting. No liking their posts. No ""casual"" hangouts.** If you see them in person because you share friend groups or work together, keep it polite but brief. You're not being mean. You're protecting your mental health.

Research from the Journal of Neurophysiology shows that seeing or interacting with someone you're attracted to triggers the same reward pathways as drug use. You're literally trying to break an addiction. You wouldn't hang out with heroin if you were trying to quit heroin.

## Step 5: Flood Your Brain with New Experiences

Your brain is stuck in a loop because it has limited data. It thinks your crush is the ONLY source of excitement and possibility. Prove it wrong.

**Try new shit constantly.** New coffee shop. New workout class. New hobby you've never considered. Book a solo trip. Say yes to random invitations. The goal is to create NEW neural pathways that don't include your crush.

Download **Meetup** or **Eventbrite** and force yourself to attend at least two new social events per week. Even if they suck. Especially if they suck. You're training your brain that life exists beyond this one person.

## Step 6: Physical Purge (Move Your Body)

Sitting around thinking about your crush makes everything worse. Unprocessed emotions get STUCK in your body. You need to move them out.

**High intensity exercise is your weapon.** Boxing. Running. Dancing like an idiot in your room. Anything that makes you sweat and breathe hard. This isn't about getting hot (though that's a bonus). It's about neurochemistry.

Exercise literally changes your brain chemistry, reducing cortisol and boosting endorphins. When you're physically exhausted, you have less energy to obsess. I use the **Nike Training Club app** for free intense workouts that leave me too tired to spiral.

## Step 7: Talk to Literally Anyone Else

Stop making your crush the center of your universe. Start actual conversations with other humans. Not to find a replacement, but to remind yourself that connection exists everywhere.

**Text old friends. Join Discord servers about your interests. Comment on Reddit posts. Swipe on dating apps even if you're not ready to date.** Just INTERACT with other humans who aren't your crush.

The book **""Attached"" by Amir Levine** explains how our attachment systems can fixate on one person when we're anxious. Diversifying your social connections literally rewires your brain to stop hyper-focusing on unavailable people. Game changer.

If you want to go deeper into understanding why you're stuck in these patterns but don't have time to read through dense psychology books, there's an AI-powered app called BeFreed that's been helpful. You can type in your specific situation, like ""I keep getting fixated on people who don't want me back"" and it'll pull from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights on attachment styles, dopamine addiction, and emotional patterns to create personalized audio content just for your situation. 

You can choose how deep you want to go, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and actionable strategies. The voice options are actually addictive, there's this smoky, slightly sarcastic one that makes listening way more engaging than typical self-help stuff. It also builds you a learning plan based on your unique struggle and keeps evolving as you use it.

## Step 8: Feel the Grief (Then Let It Go)

You're losing something, even if you never really had it. That future you imagined? It's dying. That sucks. Let yourself be sad about it.

**Set a timer for 15 minutes.** Cry, journal, scream into a pillow, listen to sad music. FEEL IT FULLY. Then when the timer goes off, you're done for the day. Wash your face. Do something else.

Try the **Finch app** for guided emotional processing and self-care reminders. It's like having a tiny supportive bird friend who checks in when you're struggling. Sounds weird but thousands of people swear by it.

## Step 9: Rewrite the Story You're Telling Yourself

You keep replaying the same narrative: ""They're perfect, I'm not good enough, I'll never find anyone like them."" BULLSHIT.

**Write a new story.** ""This person wasn't right for me. Someone who doesn't choose me isn't my person. I deserve mutual love. This is redirecting me toward something better.""

Say it out loud even if you don't believe it yet. Your brain learns through repetition. The podcast **""Where Should We Begin"" by Esther Perel** has incredible episodes on reframing relationship narratives and understanding why we fixate on certain people.

## Step 10: Build a Life That Doesn't Need Them

The ultimate goal isn't to stop having feelings. It's to build such a full, interesting, exciting life that your crush becomes background noise.

**What would you do if you weren't thinking about them?** That trip you've been postponing? That creative project? That career move? DO THOSE THINGS NOW.

Read **""The Mountain Is You"" by Brianna Wiest**. Seriously, read it. It's about self-sabotage and how we often cling to painful situations because they're familiar. This book will piss you off in the best way and make you realize you've been choosing to stay stuck.

Your crush isn't the main character of your story. You are. Start acting like it.",1,1771219328.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

Folded shirts no one would buy, tidied displays that would be torn up by the weekend. Clocked out at the right time. No mistakes. If the others noticed how tightly I was holding my jaw, they didn’t say anything.

I made myself a coffee in the breakroom, letting the motion steady me. I wasn’t tired, not really. Just restless. And the room was still, too still like the quiet had weight to it tonight. That’s when I noticed the ticking.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

Sharp, measured. I scanned the room. No clocks. Not on the wall, not on the counters. But the sound was there anyway. I could feel it crawling into the back of my skull. Nothing loud just enough to make me pay attention.

Then the cold hit.

Not a gust. Not even a breeze. Just that creeping sensation shoulders tightening, skin bristling. Like my body was remembering something before my brain could place it. I gripped the coffee mug tighter. My hands were still warm, but it didn’t help.

Then came the smell.

Lavender. Faint and worn out, like it had clung to the same piece of clothing through years of washing. I didn’t have to guess where it came from.

She used to wear it. Not of the mother.

A cheap perfume. Something she picked because it sounded fancy. She’d always overdo it, too thought it made her seem grown-up. I remember once I asked her if she realized she smelled like a laundry aisle exploded. She laughed. Then she cried. It was always one or the other with her.

Now the scent just hovered, thin but persistent, and I hated how fast it brought her back.

Not with guilt. Not with sorrow. Just... irritation. Like an old song you hated but couldn’t forget.

I stood there a moment longer, sipping my coffee, letting the chill settle in.

The store was dead quiet now. No more customers. No announcements. Just the faint buzz of overhead lights and that soft, constant tick. Somewhere out in the aisles.

I flinched actually *flinched* when I felt a hand rest on my shoulder.

A pathetic sound slipped out of me. Not quite a yelp, more like a half-formed gasp caught in my throat. I spun around too quickly, half-expecting to see *her.* The one I knew I’d never see again. Not really. But still, my body reacted before logic could catch up.

Instead, it was just Mark. One of my coworkers. A “friend,” if I wanted to stretch the definition far enough.

He looked at me with a mix of confusion and amusement, like I was a nervous cat he’d accidentally startled. Probably thought it was funny.

The fear drained almost instantly but it didn’t leave relief in its place. Just that low-simmering frustration I’d been carrying all night. I gave a short breath through my nose and forced a weak smile.

“Jesus,” I muttered, brushing his hand off. “You trying to get punched?”

He raised his hands in mock surrender, chuckling like we were sharing a joke. I didn’t laugh.

Whatever he’d come over to say some dumb comment about the clock-out line, or a story about a customer I wasn’t listening anymore. My attention was still trailing back to the feeling from just moments before. That chill, that smell. The echo of something that had no business lingering here.

I hated how easily I'd been shaken.

I hated more that someone saw it.

“Man, you looked like you saw a ghost. You okay?”

I forced a tight smile, the kind that barely reached the eyes. “Yeah? Maybe next time, try not to sneak up on people like some kind of debt collector. Not everyone walks around here without a care in the world.”

He laughed- God, he always laughed like everything was a joke, like nothing touched him deeper than surface level. “Didn’t mean to startle you. You’ve just been kinda… off lately.”

“‘Off.’” I took a slow sip of my coffee. “That’s a polite way to say it. I call it functioning in a world full of idiots. But yeah, you’re probably right. I guess I’ve had more important things on my mind than smiling at customers who can’t read a clearance tag.”

“No judgment here,” he said, flashing that usual easy grin. “We all have those days. Gotta keep it together somehow.”

“Sure. Except some of us *do* keep it together, while others breeze through the day like they’re the star of some feel-good workplace sitcom.” I gestured toward the front of the store where he'd spent most of his shift pretending to be busy. “Must be nice  having that kind of charming uselessness.”

His smile faltered, just a little. “Okay, wow. Rough day, huh? I was just checking in.”

“That’s thoughtful,” I said, nodding slowly. “Almost makes me forget how often I end up straightening your section before close. But hey, I’m sure pretending to talk someone into buying a toaster is exhausting work.”

The silence stretched between us. He chuckled, but it was forced now, the sound thin and brittle. “Look, man, I wasn’t trying to start anything. You’ve just seemed kind of quiet lately.”

“I’ve been listening,” I said flatly. “You should try it sometime. You might hear how little you actually say that’s worth remembering.” i breathed through my nose, trying to gather my temper “But no, I’m fine. Really. Everything’s… under control.”

He shifted his weight, scratching the back of his neck like he wasn’t sure whether to stay or bail. “Alright, man. I’ll let you get back to your coffee.”

I offered another smile this one even colder than the first. “You do that. And hey, next time you want to check in? Maybe think twice. Not everyone’s as forgiving as I am.”

He hesitated, then turned and walked off, probably thinking I was just in a mood, just tired.

I watched him go, eyes fixed on his back like I was memorizing it.

The coffee steamed faintly in my hand. My knuckles had gone white on the mug’s handle, and I hadn’t even noticed.

I rubbed at the dark crescent of shadow under my eye, a poor attempt at wiping away the exhaustion that had settled into my skin. It wasn’t exactly polite, snapping the way I did. But hell someone had to catch the blowback. And he just happened to be the nearest warm body in range. Wrong place, wrong time. That’s all it took.

My coffee came and went, long gone before I even realized I’d finished it. I drifted through the dead weight of the final shift hours, running on fumes and muscle memory. Eventually, the lights dimmed, the store locked down, and I slipped out into the cool quiet of the villa district, waiting at the cracked curb for the late-night bus. Another casualty in the slow collapse of my schedule. Another fracture in the structure I lived by.

But this time, the disruption was… pleasant.

There was a girl waiting, standing just a few paces from the signpost. A different girl not her. This one was younger. A year or two, maybe. Redhead. Small. Scrawny in that way that made her look like she hadn’t grown into her frame yet. There was something raw about her presence, like a sketch with too many lines, still unfinished.

The closer I got, the more details clicked into place. A bob cut that framed her jaw like she’d done it herself with kitchen scissors. Freckles across the bridge of her nose. She was fidgeting her foot tapping, hands picking at her sleeve like she didn’t belong in her own skin. She would be my favorite, I thought. Not in a lustful way. Something else. Something colder. Possessive.

And then I caught myself. In the glass of the bus stop shelter, I caught my own reflection.

My posture was wrong. Too focused. My steps too measured. Eyes fixed too long. I looked like something hunting.

She noticed, too.

“Can I help you?” she asked, voice light, sing-songy in that way only extroverts could manage without self-awareness. A little performative. But not scared. Not yet.

I smiled.

A polite, practiced thing.

Because that’s what people expected from someone like me.

The moment the words left her mouth, I felt something in me jolt. Not panic no, I don’t panic. But something adjacent to it. Like an engine misfiring.

She’d seen me.

Not really, not fully but just enough to make me pause. Enough to make me aware of myself. The angle of my neck. The intensity in my stare. I must have looked like I was about to ask her for something I wasn’t supposed to want.

That wouldn’t do.

So I shifted softened my posture, let my shoulders slack a little, let the smile warm at the corners like I’d just now noticed her and found something amusing, something friendly. A man waiting for the bus, same as her. Harmless.

“I was just wondering if this route’s still running,” I said, voice low and casual, like I’d pulled it from a pocket and dusted it off. “The last one's late. Or I’m early. Hard to tell.”

It came out smoother than I expected.

She didn’t look convinced, not entirely, but she smiled back anyway, a quick flicker of expression like a reflex. Social politeness. She probably thought she was being nice to some awkward guy who didn’t know how to talk to women. That worked for me. Better to be misread than understood.

Inside, though, my thoughts crawled with irritation.

I hadn’t meant to come off that obvious. I hated being interrupted mid-thought. Hated being caught off-balance, even momentarily. She’d chipped the edge of something I kept carefully honed.

But I kept the smile. Let it linger just long enough. Then I looked away, feigning interest in the empty street ahead as if the bus might appear if I stared hard enough.

She turned back to her phone. I watched her from the reflection in the glass.

And just like that, I was invisible again.

Still no bus. The street was washed in that sodium-orange glow, everything soft around the edges, like the world itself was exhausted. The air had that weird dead weight to it heavy, but not cold. Just the kind of night that made people quieter than usual.

I shifted my weight on the bench, letting out a quiet sigh as if I’d just remembered how long the day had been.

She was still standing, thumbs tapping at her screen. The glow of it lit up her face. Pale freckles across the nose. Lips slightly chapped. Hair curling at the ends from the humidity.

She looked so young.

Not a kid, not that young. But younger than me. Eighteen, nineteen, maybe twenty if I was being generous. I was twenty-six. Not ancient. Not anything. Just old enough to know better and young enough not to care.

“You’re brave, you know,” I said, glancing over again. “Out this late by yourself. Most girls I know wouldn’t even wait for the bus without someone on the phone.”

She looked up, brows knitting. “It’s not that late.”

“Sure, but still,” I said with a slight shrug. “City’s not what it used to be. You hear things.”

She gave a polite chuckle, clearly trying not to engage too deeply. But I wasn’t done yet.

“I used to take this route after late shifts when I was your age,” I added. “Back when I was still trying to figure out if I wanted to be useful or just get paid.”

She smiled faintly, not sure how to respond.

“You working part-time?” I asked. “Or school full-time with a gig on the side?”

“Both,” she said, wary but not yet defensive. “Barista job. And classes during the week.”

“Let me guess psych major?”

She laughed at that, a real one this time. “Why does everyone assume that?”

I smiled back, pleasant. “Because you’ve got that look. Like you’re trying to figure everyone out before they figure you out first.”

That earned me a glance. Appraising. Measuring.

I leaned back a little, relaxing into the bench like I had all the time in the world. “Parents okay with you working this late?”

She hesitated.

That was good. Hesitation meant she was parsing whether I was making casual conversation or something else. That flicker of tension in the shoulders, the way her grip on the phone tightened slightly it meant she noticed. Not what I was, maybe, but *something*.

“I mean,” I added, easing the weight of it, “Mine used to throw a fit if I came home after ten. Think they thought the world turned into a warzone after dark.”

She laughed softly. “Mine don’t really care. They’re barely home.”

That answered more than she realized.

“Must be nice,” I said, looking ahead down the street. “Freedom and all.”

She didn’t reply. Just tucked a strand of red hair behind her ear, then checked her phone again no new notifications.

I could feel her starting to pull away, internally. That instinct. The invisible rope tightening, gently tugging her back into herself. She was trying not to show it, but she was clocking the shift in tone. Her animal brain knew something was off, even if she couldn't articulate it.

But I smiled like nothing had changed. Like we were just two strangers passing time.

Because that’s what people like me are good at.

Smiling when we mean anything but.

“Name’s... Danny, by the way.”  
The lie rolled off my tongue like I’d practiced it. Because I had, in a way. You don’t just give out real names. Not when you’ve taken the time to pick someone out.

I angled my body just enough to face her without turning fully. Casual. Relaxed. Inviting, even. My eyes tried to meet hers those olive-green things, sharp and pretty, but skittish like a deer’s. She didn’t hold the gaze long. Just flicked her attention away, back to the street, to the dark, empty sidewalk stretching in both directions.

“Uh…” she started, chewing on the word like it might taste different if she waited. “Nice to meet you, I guess.”

Her voice had changed. Not enough for anyone else to notice but I did. The syllables felt thinner. Measured. She was trying to figure out if being polite was still the safe play.

“You don’t have to tell me yours,” I said, smiling like I meant it. “Wouldn’t want you thinking I’m some creep or something.” That earned a small breath from her halfway to a laugh but caught in her throat. I could practically hear the thought behind her eyes, *Too late.*

She tucked her phone into her coat pocket now, not out of trust but because she didn’t want to seem rude. These were the calculations people made when they felt something wasn’t quite right but couldn’t justify walking away yet. The distance between us felt heavier now. Not physical just... *present.* Like the silence had gained weight.

I glanced down the road, pretending to check for headlights. “This damn bus,” I muttered. “They always say it’s on schedule, but when you need it, poof.”

Still no sign. Just us.

“You sure it runs this late?” she asked, her voice smaller now.

“Oh yeah,” I said with a little nod. “Trust me. I’ve been taking this route a long time.”

That part wasn’t a lie.

And the longer she stood there, the more I could feel her second-guessing whatever part of her said it was okay to wait at this stop tonight.

“Y’know- I…”  
The words caught in my throat before they ever made it to air.

She’d turned her head slightly while I was talking, just a casual glance toward something behind me. My eyes followed, half-interested until I saw where she was looking.

Down the alley across the street. That narrow little cut between two old buildings, where the streetlight didn’t quite reach. Nothing special at first. Just shadows, dumpsters, the usual inner-city filth.

But then I saw it.  
That flash of pale blonde.

Thin strands catching just the barest trace of light like silk in murky water.

My stomach dropped. My knees turned to jelly, wobbly and useless, like I’d suddenly forgotten how to exist in my own skin. Something inside me shriveled. Not fear exactly , something worse. Recognition.

“Y’know– I…”

I was about to say something dumb. Another line. Something offhand to keep the conversation going, to keep her anchored to me for just a few minutes longer.

But then her head turned. Slight barely a shift. Her gaze flicked over my shoulder, casual like someone reacting to a movement in the periphery. Not alarmed. Just aware.

I followed her line of sight without thinking.

It was just across the street. Tucked between a bakery and one of those long-shuttered storefronts they never seem to do anything with. The alley there wasn’t unusual. Trash bins, cracked concrete, faint graffiti. Not even deep enough to hide much. Just shadow pooled in the corners where the light couldn’t reach.

But something was off. I felt it before I understood it.

Then I saw it.

A thin lock of pale hair blonde, almost silver drifting at the edge of a breeze that didn’t exist. Just hanging there, like it was suspended in water. Limp, motionless, except when it wasn’t. Not attached to anything I could see. No figure. No face. Just that impossible hair.

It wasn’t just a trick of the light. I knew it wasn’t. I knew it because my legs went weak before I even fully processed it. My knees buckled slightly, not enough to fall, just enough to feel it in my gut. A weird, electric sickness rolled over me like vertigo.

I blinked hard.

Gone.

Nothing there. Just shadows again.

My mouth was dry. The words I had queued up melted behind my teeth.

“I— I’m–”  
I tried again, my voice sounding distant. Like someone else was speaking through me, poorly. “It’s late,” I mumbled. “I’d… I’d walk if I were you. Take the long way. Just safer, y’know?”

She turned back toward me, slowly. Her expression had shifted just slightly. Whatever friendliness had been there was now tinged with uncertainty. A slight squint to the eyes. A crease in her brow. She was trying to read me.

The taste of coffee had turned bitter in my mouth. My hands were clammy. I rubbed them on my jeans, trying to act casual. Like I wasn’t rattled. Like I wasn’t about three seconds away from running into the nearest lit building and locking the door behind me.

The street was quiet. Too quiet. I could hear the distant hum of the city, but it felt far away. Muted. Like I’d slipped under the surface of something.

She looked away from me again, toward the direction the bus should be coming from. Her jaw shifted slightly, tense now. One foot angled away, ready to move.

That was enough.

I didn’t say anything else. I just kept my eyes on the sidewalk, pretending to check the time, pretending I hadn’t seen what I saw.

But I knew.

Even if it wasn’t there anymore *even if I’d imagined it* I knew that hair. I knew what it belonged to.

And it should’ve been gone.

I had made sure she was *gone*.

My footsteps echoed down the pavement, louder than they should’ve been in a place like this too loud, like they didn’t belong to me. I wasn’t quite running, not fully, but the way my stride kept quickening… it might as well have been. A half-jog masked as urgency, not panic.

The streets looked all wrong under the orange flicker of the sodium lamps, like I was walking through a reflection of my neighborhood rather than the real thing. The buildings were there, sure, but the edges were warped, stretched just slightly out of true. Every shadow looked like it was watching me.

I didn’t even hear the hiss of the bus’s hydraulics until it was already pulling up. Missed it again.

I turned just in time to catch it gliding past me with a mechanical wheeze and the moan of overused brakes. In one of the foggy windows, I caught a glimpse *her*. The redhead. My “next favorite,” if you want to call her that. She was staring out the window, her face blank, eyes not on me exactly… more like *through* me.

She didn’t wave. She didn’t even blink. But I felt the weight of her stare like cold glass pressing down on my chest.

I stood there, rooted to the concrete, heart pounding in my ears.

I felt small. Like a kid again. Like when you wake from a bad dream and run to the hallway light, only now the darkness isn’t behind you it’s in front of you, waiting.

I kept moving. Faster. Not full-out sprinting, because that would mean admitting I was afraid.

The pools of yellow light cast by the streetlamps became my lifeline splotches of temporary safety between the black gulfs. I moved from one to the next, fast, like stepping-stones. Like she might reach out from the dark spaces in between and grab my ankle, drag me back.

I could almost feel her fingers, cold, damp closing around my throat, slow and steady. Not choking me. Not yet. Just *reminding* me she could. That she was still there. That maybe, just maybe, she could give me a taste of my own medication.

My stomach had twisted itself into knots, tight and hard, the kind you can't breathe around. Every step forward felt more desperate, more rehearsed like I was performing the act of walking rather than doing it naturally. Just keep going. Just stay under the light.

The darkness between the lamps was growing. Longer gaps. Fewer lights. The buzzing glow of sodium orange had thinned out like a dying signal, and I found myself hesitating before crossing each threshold into shadow, like a child trying to leap across a creek without falling in.

My knee gave a throb. Sharp and sudden like something deep inside the joint had been quietly screaming for the last half hour and only now found the breath to speak. I staggered, then kept moving, limping slightly, trying to pretend it wasn’t happening. I hadn’t even felt it until now, hadn’t noticed the pain. Probably the adrenaline masking it, or the ungodly amount of caffeine still humming through my blood like a second heartbeat. A false balm.

But I couldn’t keep up the pace. My rhythm faltered. The skipping from light to light turned clumsy, like trying to dance while dragging a chain.

Still… despite everything, despite the ache in my leg, the tightness in my throat, and the way I kept catching phantom glimpses of movement out of the corners of my eyes I felt something unfamiliar creeping in.

Relief.

Not all at once. Just a flicker.

There, ahead through the halo of a single dim porch light I saw the curve of my street. The fence I always meant to fix. The dying shrub by the corner mailbox. The crooked lamppost that flickers every other night like a nervous tick.

And beyond it all, my house.

Modest. Dull. But unmistakably mine.

The windows were dark, but they were *familiar*. I knew their shapes. I knew their shadows. That quiet, symmetrical little face of my home looking back at me, saying: *you made it*.

Doing a small ride along here as a solo founder based in Australia.

I just launched a side project called ResumeMate. It helps tailor resumes and cover letters to job descriptions and gives ATS style feedback. Built this during nights and weekends while juggling work family and way too much coffee.

No funding. No team. Just me building breaking fixing and repeating.

Honestly launching felt harder than coding.

So far a few things surprised me. People care way more about outcomes than features. Trust and privacy matter more than fancy UI. Marketing humbles you fast. Even one real user feels massive.

Right now I am focused on learning how to get early traction without burning cash, what matters most after launch, and whether organic channels like Reddit actually work long term.

Not selling anything here. Just sharing the journey and hoping to learn from others doing the same.

Not a humble one, mind you, but a working man nonetheless. I’m telling you this so you don’t get the wrong impression, so you don’t think I’m some street-level hooligan hopped up on whatever’s going around. No, I’m nothing of the sort.

I live by structure. Every day, I wake up at 6 a.m. sharp. I spend thirty minutes stretching, make breakfast, get dressed, and leave the house by 7:15 to catch the bus. My routine isn’t just in the morning it carries through my whole day.

I keep the house clean, everything in its place. The dishes are washed as soon as they’re used.

Papers are filed where they belong.

A calm, quiet life. Predictable in all the best ways. Which is why you can understand how… disconcerting it felt when things started to change. When the order I had cultivated began to slip away, little by little.

So you must understand how I began to feel when that got estranged. It started subtly so subtly that at first, I thought it was merely my imagination. A misplaced coffee mug here, a pair of shoes slightly askew there. These were small, forgettable deviations, but they stuck with me in the same way a fly buzzing around your ear might.

persistent and maddeningly difficult to ignore.

I tried to convince myself it was nothing. We all make little mistakes, don’t we? But this wasn’t like me. Every inch of my home had its place.

The second morning, I woke up at 6:03 a.m. Three minutes late. My alarm clock, which had never failed me in the ten years I owned it, was blinking 12:00 as if a power outage had reset it during the night. I hadn’t heard thunder. No storms had been forecasted. Yet, there it was.

That day felt wrong, though I carried on as usual. I stretched, made breakfast, and caught the bus at 7:15, precisely as always. But something gnawed at me, a nagging sensation that lingered even as I sat at my desk at work. It wasn’t until I returned home that I noticed the first glaring aberration.

My front door was locked, but not as I’d left it. The chain, which I always, *always* latch before leaving, dangled loosely.

My heart skipped, and I froze for a moment, staring at the door like it might lunge at me. I slowly unlocked it, pushing it open with the edge of my foot. The house was silent, still, and yet something was… off. Not wrong enough to scream *intruder,* but just enough to put a chill in my spine.

The kitchen was where I first noticed it. The utensils in the drawer always arranged largest to smallest were jumbled as if someone had run their hand through them carelessly. The cereal boxes in the pantry, which I keep alphabetized by brand, were shuffled out of order. And my morning coffee mug, which I had rinsed and placed on the drying rack, was gone entirely. It wasn’t in the sink, the cabinet, or anywhere else it could reasonably be.

I stood there for what felt like hours, searching, rationalizing. Maybe I had misplaced it in my haste. Maybe the chain on the door had slipped. Maybe I had been careless and didn’t notice. But that explanation didn’t sit right. It *couldn’t* sit right.

By the third day, the deviations became too stark to brush off as forgetfulness. My toothbrush, the one I had used the night before, was replaced by a different brand entirely. My phone alarm played a melody I didn’t recognize, even though I hadn’t changed it. A photo frame in the living room was turned upside down, its smiling image of my younger self grinning at me from a skewed angle.

At this point, I wasn’t merely unsettled. I was angry. My routine, my calm and quiet life, was being invaded. I tore through the house, checking every door and window. Nothing was broken. There were no signs of forced entry. And yet… it felt as though someone or something had been here.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, ears straining for every creak, every distant sound. My house, which I had always found comforting in its quiet, now felt alive with subtle noises I couldn’t place. A faint tapping on the window. The soft shuffle of footsteps or was it my imagination? By the time dawn crept through the blinds, I had decided on one thing

I needed answers.

The fourth night, I took my day off. I almost never did such things didn’t like to. I always saved them up for something bigger.

a long holiday to visit family or a quiet retreat to some Airbnb far from this town and its humdrum middle-of-nowhere routine. But tonight was different. Tonight, I needed to confront this growing dread.

I sat in the dark, every light in the house extinguished, save for the soft glow of my phone’s screen as I checked the time. Midnight had come and gone, and still, I strained my ears for something- anything. Creaking floorboards. Gnawing sounds. The faint shuffle of handles twisting in their sockets. I focused so hard that my temples throbbed, my breath shallow, my entire body coiled tight like a spring.

And then a thought slithered its way into my mind, unbidden and unwelcome.

*""Could she have left?""*

The very idea sent a shiver crawling down my spine, its icy fingers wrapping around my chest. I shook my head quickly, dismissing it. *No. Not possible.*

I locked the door. I knew I locked that door. Every night, without fail, I locked it. Checked it. Rechecked it. And if she *had* left—*if*— then someone would’ve noticed by now. Someone would’ve come here. There would’ve been questions. There would’ve been noise.

But there hadn’t been.

The silence was suffocating now, heavy and oppressive. It pressed down on me, made me doubt things I knew were true, made me doubt *myself*. I rubbed my temples, trying to banish the gnawing unease, but it was useless. The thought lingered, circling my mind like a predator waiting to pounce.

I hadn’t thought of her in days, I realized. Not consciously, at least. That was strange in and of itself. She had always been a constant, like the ticking of my watch or the hum of the fridge in the background. But now? Now it felt like she had slipped into the same void where my coffee mug, my toothbrush, and my sense of order had disappeared.

I stood up suddenly, unable to sit with the thought any longer. The house creaked under my weight, and I froze, listening. Was it just me, or was there an answering sound? A faint shuffle, almost imperceptible, but there. My heart hammered against my ribs as I moved toward the hallway.

“Hello?” I called, my voice barely more than a whisper. It was the first time I’d spoken aloud all night. The sound of it startled me, made the house feel even emptier.

No response. Just the quiet.

I moved down the hall, my fingers grazing the wall for balance as I went. At the end of the corridor was her room. I hesitated in front of the door, hand hovering over the handle. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d opened it. Days? Weeks? Longer? My mind felt slippery, unreliable.

Slowly, I pushed the door open.

The steps down the creaky, familiar stairs were jarring. Each groan of the wood underfoot felt sharper than I remembered, louder in the oppressive silence of the house. Had it always been like this? I couldn’t recall the last time I’d ventured down here, to the basement. I’d avoided it for so long, pushed it out of my mind entirely.

But now, with the unease twisting in my gut like a living thing, I found myself descending into the dark.

The air grew cooler with every step, damp and thick. The faint smell of mildew hit me, mingled with something else something metallic, almost like rust. My hand brushed against the splintered railing as I steadied myself. It felt rough and foreign, like it belonged to another house entirely.

The basement door loomed ahead, its chipped paint barely visible in the dim light. I hesitated for a moment, listening. There was no sound, no movement from the other side. Just the faint hum of the house settling around me.

Taking a deep breath, I pushed the door open.

The basement stretched out before me, cloaked in shadow. The single bare bulb hanging from the ceiling flickered weakly, casting uneven light that seemed to shiver against the walls. Everything felt sharper here-

colder, heavier, wrong.

I stepped inside, the floorboards beneath me replaced by cold cement. The faint echo of my footsteps reverberated in the emptiness, a hollow sound that made the space feel even larger than it was. The clutter I remembered.  
old boxes, rusting tools, forgotten keepsakes seemed to have shifted, though I couldn’t say how.

My eyes scanned the room, searching for… what? I wasn’t even sure anymore. The unease gnawed at me, a sharp contrast to the stale calm I’d clung to for so long. The shadows seemed to stretch unnaturally, pooling in the corners like something alive.

“Hello?” I called out, barely squeaking it out . It felt absurd, speaking aloud to an empty basement, but the silence demanded to be broken.

Nothing. Just the hum of the flickering bulb.

Then, faintly, the sound of something shifting. A scrape, like wood dragging against cement. My heart leapt, my pulse hammering in my ears as I turned toward the noise. It had come from the far corner of the room, where the light barely reached.

I took a step closer, then another, the sound of my own breathing deafening in the stillness. My eyes strained to see into the darkness, to make sense of the shapes lurking there.

And then I saw it

the faint outline of a chair, toppled on its side. It wasn’t there before, was it? My chest tightened as I stared at it, the world around me narrowing until there was only that chair, lying on its side like a discarded thought.

“Not possible,” I muttered, shaking my head. I clenched my fists, trying to ground myself, to push back against the growing panic clawing at the edges of my mind.

But as I took another step closer, I realized something else.

The chair wasn’t just toppled.

It was rocking.

It must have been a gust of wind rocking that chair. It had to be. I told myself that, again and again, like a prayer whispered into the dark.

But then I saw her.

She was exactly as I’d left her.

Her clammy, grayish skin stretched tight over her form, unchanged from the last time I’d come down here. The malformed stubs of what once were arms lay splayed across the cold concrete floor, still grotesque in their stillness. Her mummified face stared blankly, frozen in that same eerie expression I remembered–

–weeks ago, was it?

The smell hit me next. Lavender, faint and clinging, mixed with the sickly sweetness of decayed flesh. It lingered in the air like a ghost, the same as before. The same as always.

I don’t know what came over me then, but I’ll admit, what I did next was... childish. Too childish for someone like me. Maybe it was the tension, the nerves fraying at the edges. Maybe it was some morbid need to prove to myself that she was still what? Dead? Real?

I stepped closer, each movement hesitant, deliberate, until I was standing mere feet away from her. The air felt heavier here, pressing against my chest. I held my breath and reached out, giving her a tentative nudge with my foot.

I froze, half-expecting her to lunge at me. But then the absurdity of the thought crept in. *Lunge at me with what?* She didn’t have hands. The idea almost made me chuckle, though the sound died in my throat.

Feeling bolder, I kicked her ribs-

just hard enough to make her rock to the side. The hollow sound of her body shifting on the cement echoed faintly in the room.

I sighed, relief washing over me like a wave. She was still just a corpse, still just... her.

The motion was almost reflexive, brushing her hair- or what was left of it away from her face. It crumbled like dry leaves under my touch, the golden strands disintegrating as they fell between my fingers. I stared at my palm, at the brittle remnants, and felt a strange cocktail of disgust and nostalgia swirl in my gut.

“She’s not going anywhere,” I muttered aloud, as if saying it would make it more true.

Her face, that mummified visage frozen in the same faint grimace, still seemed to hold a trace of something. Anger, Fear, It was hard to tell after all this time. The lavender smell clung to her, cloying and sickly sweet, mingling with the faint iron tang of decay. It felt like the air itself had absorbed the scent, like it was a part of this basement now.

I stood up, brushing my hands on my pants out of habit, even though the act felt absurd in this moment. She was still there, exactly as I’d left her. Still just as lifeless. The absurdity of it all it almost made me laugh.

And yet, I couldn’t shake the unease crawling up my spine. That damned rocking chair hadn’t been there before.

I glanced back at the corner, at the shadowy outline of the chair now perfectly still. My mind itched with questions I didn’t want to ask, let alone answer. “Alright,” I said to no one in particular, straightening myself. “You’re fine. She’s still dead.""

As I turned to leave that damp, suffocating basement, I found myself succumbing to another childish impulse. A petty defiance against the unease gnawing at me.

I flicked off the light.

The darkness swallowed the room instantly, and I began making my way up the stairs. *Step… step…* The creaks sounded off rhythmically beneath me. Was the way always this long?

The unease grew sharper, tightening around my chest. My measured steps quickened, each movement more frantic than the last. Soon, I was half-running, my breath shallow, my heart pounding like a drum.

Then *thunk*. My toe caught the edge of a step, and I stumbled forward, banging my knee hard against the wood. Pain flared, but I didn’t stop. With a final lunge, I threw myself through the basement door, slamming it shut behind me with such force the entire house seemed to rattle. The sound echoed in my ears, but I didn’t stop to listen.

I barreled down the hallway, my footsteps pounding like a chase was on, then up the stairs in a near frenzy. When I finally reached my room, I dove under the covers like a child escaping a monster in the dark.

The glow of the lampshade cast long, uneven shadows across the walls of my room, each one twisting and shifting as my breathing slowed. My chest heaved, the adrenaline still coursing through me, making every tiny sound feel amplified. The faint creak of the house settling, the distant hum of the refrigerator downstairs, even the rustling of my own sheets—they all felt like whispers in a deafening silence.

I pulled the covers up to my chin, a childish comfort that somehow felt like a shield against whatever my imagination decided to conjure. The faint ache in my knee pulsed, a grounding reminder that this was real no dream, no overactive fantasy. But even as I tried to reassure myself, my eyes kept darting to the corners of the room, to the shadows that lingered just out of reach of the warm light.

The smell of lavender wouldn’t leave my nose. It clung to me like a ghost, faint but inescapable. I didn’t know if it was real or just my mind playing tricks, but either way, it made me nauseous.

I tried to reason with myself as I lay there, heart still racing. *It’s just an old basement. Just her body. Nothing moved, nothing followed. The chair was the wind, the rest was nerves. You’re fine. It’s fine.*

But even as I repeated those words in my head, they felt hollow. The memory of the basement door slamming echoed in my ears, louder than it should have been. And beneath that echo, faint and distant, I thought I heard something else.

A creak.

Just one.

I gripped the blankets tighter, squeezing my eyes shut as though that could block out the sound.

“It’s the house,” I whispered to myself. “Just the house.”

The night dragged on, every second stretching into an eternity. I stared at the glowing lampshade, refusing to let my eyes wander too far from its comforting light. Sleep didn’t come easy, but eventually, the exhaustion of the day won out.

As I drifted into a restless sleep, one final thought lingered in the back of my mind

*Did I lock the basement door?*

That night, I didn’t sleep well. Not that it was a nightmare.

..at least, not in the traditional sense but I wouldn’t call it a dream either. It was something in between, like slipping in and out of consciousness while being dragged through some half-formed memory. I can’t recall it clearly, not all of it, but I’ll try to lay it out the best I can.

I remember walking. One of the streets near home, or at least it looked like it. The buildings had that familiar half-worn, brick-and-plaster look my neighborhood’s known for. But the more I tried to place where I was, the less it made sense. You know how dreams do that thing? Where everything feels absurdly detailed, but when you try to focus on any one part: read a sign, trace a wall it all blurs into nonsense.

I wasn’t alone. I was following someone. A woman, maybe? I can’t say for sure. I couldn’t make out her face or hear her voice, but I remember the shape of her, and long, pale blonde hair that shimmered under the strange, grey sky. She never looked back, not even once. And yet… I knew she wanted me to follow. Needed me to. That certainty pulled me forward, even as the air around me grew colder with every step.

The street beneath my feet began to change. One moment, it was pavement. The next, it had the consistency of wet sand, or ash. The harder I tried to move, the more resistance I felt. It was like my legs were sinking through the concrete itself. My body turned sluggish, heavy. My arms refused to swing. My breath grew shallow, The air grew colder with every step I took. Not normal cold, *heavy* cold, like the kind that settles behind your ribs.

But I didn’t stop. I couldn’t. I reached out just a hand’s length away from her hair, which was now blowing in some wind I couldn’t feel when everything went limp. My body collapsed, not downward, but inward. I fell not through space, but into something that felt like absence. Like a hole in existence. There was no sensation, no light, no sound. Just that hair fading into the dark.

I woke up in a haze, limbs aching like I’d spent the night wrestling with my own sheets. Dragging myself out of bed felt like an accomplishment in itself. My eyes were dry, my head throbbed, and a thick layer of anxiety clung to my skin like humidity. I couldn’t shake it. The dream clung to me like static silent, invisible, but always buzzing just beneath the surface.

I did a full sweep of the house before even thinking about breakfast. Opened closets. Checked behind curtains. Pulled open the bathroom mirror cabinet even though I knew exactly what was in there. Nothing. Everything was where it should be. But it didn’t feel right. The air felt... used. Like someone else had been breathing it before I woke.

I still left on time. I checked the clock. Twice. The digital readout blinked a perfect 7:15 a.m. when I locked the door. And yet, the bus was already gone by the time I reached the stop. Not pulling away. Gone. Just... gone. I stood there, staring at the empty road, then at the bus schedule I already had memorized. It made no sense. I’d left on time. The bus should’ve been there. It *should* have been.

So I waited. Half an hour, arms folded, jaw clenched. Another bus would come, eventually. And sure enough, it did. But that wasn’t the point.

The point is, I don’t miss the bus. I don’t *oversleep*. I don’t lose track of time. That’s not me. That’s not my life. And yet here I was late to work, again. Third time this week. My boss didn’t even raise his voice this time, just gave me that disappointed look, the kind that makes you feel like less than nothing.

Something’s off. Something small, creeping in at the edges. Like a loose thread slowly unraveling everything I’ve worked so hard to keep together.

This isn’t just a bad week. I know that now. It’s something else. Something I can’t quite name yet.

I shuffled into my cubicle like a man clocking in for a sentence. Let out a sigh, tried to gather what few thoughts I had left. My boss had already given me that stink-eye he’s perfected, no words, just that simmering disappointment that makes your skin crawl more than outright yelling. He lingered a minute longer, then walked off to harass someone else in a different section of the store.

Same shift. Same routine. The dead rhythm of retail. Scan. Smile. Stock. Smile. Break. Smile. Pretend you don’t notice the security cameras blinking overhead like mechanical eyelids.

I couldn't exactly clear my mind, I caught myself glancing over my shoulder more than once. Couldn’t help it. The sensation was back that awful prickling under the skin, like eyes brushing against the nape of your neck. At first, I told myself it was just my boss circling back, or maybe a customer standing a little too close behind me.

I tried to brush it off. I glanced toward the front of the store just a few customers wandering between the racks. A couple of teenagers looking at hoodies. A mother juggling a toddler and a clearance cart. No one paying attention to me.

Still, I looked over my shoulder. Nothing. Checked the mirrored dome on the ceiling. The security camera just sat there, its red LED blinking like it always did. Probably a manager watching the floor from the back room, bored out of their mind.

But something about it didn’t feel routine.

Every time I tried to settle into a task, I found myself looking up. To the left. Toward the end of the aisle. Not because I heard anything. Just because I *felt* something. Like I was being observed not in that normal retail way, not like customer-service-mode. This felt different. Closer.

At one point, I walked toward the stockroom to grab some folded signage, and when I passed the edge of the seasonal aisle, I swear I saw someone standing at the far end. Just a quick glimpse. Not a face just the shape of someone in a long coat, facing away from me, standing still.

I blinked, stepped back to look again. Gone.

I stood there for a second, unsure if I should laugh it off or not. Maybe it was a mannequin. Maybe I imagined it. The lights in this place have a way of playing tricks on you, especially when you’re running on fumes.

Back at the cubicle, I tried to get my head back in the game. Opened the daily update memo. Scanned the markdown list. Rechecked the promo signs.

But my thoughts kept drifting.

I blinked. Rubbed the corner of my eyes with the side of my hand, trying to massage away the dull sting building behind them. I glanced around the aisle again, slower this time. Nothing out of place. Just shelves, clothes, a half-empty cart someone hadn’t returned.

Maybe it was just a customer passing by. That’s what I told myself. Some regular, cutting across an aisle while my brain was still booting up from lack of sleep. My tired mind latched onto that explanation and wouldn’t let go. It made sense– at least more sense than the alternative.

But even as I stood there, trying to will myself back into the rhythm of the day, I couldn’t shake how clear the image had been. Not a blur. Not a shadow. A *person*. Still. Facing away. Gone too fast.

I let out a breath through my nose and turned back toward my station. My head was heavy. My legs were dragging. I hadn’t managed more than a few hours of sleep the night before just enough to keep me upright.

The sharp clack of heels on polished tile snapped me out of my half-daydream. The sound echoed louder than it should’ve in the near-empty aisle, crisp and deliberate. A second later, a wave of perfume followed sweet, floral, and just strong enough to stir something in the back of my mind.

I turned, blinking to clear my vision as it sharpened against the harsh fluorescent lights. That’s when I saw her.

The clack of her heels snapped me out of it. Not the dream, but the haze that had been clinging to me all morning. I looked up, expecting another bored shopper drifting through clearance racks.

But then I saw *her*.

She moved slower than most. Not old, exactly, but worn in a way that made age irrelevant. Her blonde hair once the kind that probably turned heads was pulled back in a loose knot, wisps falling around her face like she hadn’t bothered with a mirror. Her coat hung off her frame, stiff at the shoulders, like she hadn’t gotten around to washing it this season.

And her eyes. That was the part I couldn’t forget. Heavy, red at the edges, like the kind of tired that doesn’t go away with sleep. She didn’t look lost, but she didn’t look like she had a reason for being here either.

I stepped out from behind the register, slow, casual, like I was just doing my job. I didn’t plan to talk to her. Not really. But my mouth moved anyway.

“Hi there. You doing alright?”

She stopped. Looked at me. I expected a polite smile, maybe a quick ‘just browsing.’ What I got was a long pause, like she was trying to remember how words worked.

“I’m fine,” she said, though she didn’t sound it. “Just looking.”

I nodded, gesturing toward the racks. “Well, you’ve got the run of the place tonight. Everyone else must’ve found better things to do.”

That didn’t get a laugh. She barely even reacted. Just turned her head slightly, scanning the store like she’d already forgotten I was talking to her.

“You from around here?” I asked, tone light, like it was nothing. “Vila district, maybe? You’ve got one of those familiar faces.”

Her lips parted slightly, then closed again. I could see the hesitation crawl across her face.

“I used to live there,” she said. “A long time ago.”

“Small world,” I said, leaning lightly against a rack. “You know, there was a girl I remember used to wait at the bus stop near Elden. Always had headphones in. Blonde, like you. Kind of had that same quiet look.”

Her eyes flinched. Just for a moment. Barely noticeable. But I saw it.

“My daughter,” she said. “She’s gone.”

She didn’t say dead. Just *gone*. It hung in the air like she meant both.

I didn’t say anything at first. I let the silence drag.

“I’m sorry,” I said eventually. But I didn’t mean it. Not the way people mean it when they say sorry. It came out soft. Almost curious.

She nodded once. It wasn’t forgiveness. Just acknowledgment. Like she’d already heard all the apologies the world had to offer and filed them in a drawer somewhere she never opened anymore.

“If you need anything,” I added, stepping back, “I’ll be right here.”

She looked at me one last time. Really looked.

Then turned and walked off, her perfume trailing faintly behind her. Sweet, but tired. Like everything else about her.

I watched her until she disappeared into the aisles.

Something in me wanted to laugh. Not out loud. Not cruelly. Just… out of disbelief. She really came here. After all this time.

And part of me wondered if she'd come for clothes, or if she’d come just to see what my face would do when I saw hers.

Either way, it worked.

I don’t think she knew. Not everything, at least.

She looked at me with that foggy, unfocused kind of recognition like a name on the tip of her tongue that never quite forms. Maybe she hated me. Maybe she was just lost in it all. I couldn’t tell. Didn’t much matter either way.

People like her? They drown in their grief. They don't swim in it. You could toss them a rope and they'd tie it around their neck before you had a chance to pull.

And her daughter.

Well. Her daughter was already sinking long before I stepped in.

Not that I expect anyone to understand. They never really saw her. Not like I did. They saw the sweet girl, the surface-level charm, the act. But behind closed doors? She was spiraling. Ungrateful. Manipulative in the way only the young and bored can be. She wanted a storm. So I gave her one.

Some things you do because you’re angry. Other things… you do because it’s necessary. That’s the part people don’t get. The part they wouldn’t *want* to get.

And yeah sometimes when I look back on it, I wonder if I could’ve done it differently. Quieter, cleaner. But not better. Never better.",1,1771219173.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False
1r60vw4,https://i.redd.it/7q8z4hitjsjg1.jpeg,Can Downtown Seattle ever improve??,"I’ve been living in Downtown Seattle for a while now, working remote. I (actually) like the weather / seasons and because I travel to Asia for work a lot, the airport is quite convenient. But in the last year I feel like Downtown has significantly declined and I often wonder, will it ever improve?

**Some of the key changes I’ve noticed** 

\- **increase in homeless**, but more specifically increase in drug abuse. It’s hard to go for a 5-10 min walk to Pike Place without dodging needles, drugged out people etc. specifically 3rd / Virginia or 3rd & Pine 

\- Tons of empty **retail and store closures**: Starbucks Roastery, Anthropologie, ASEAN street market etc. 

\- **Sirens** all day / every night, I’m on the phone with peoplein Korea a lot and they always ask me why so many sirens in the background.

\- Everything is **crazy expensive**, food, coffee etc. I just got back from NYC and felt the food there was much cheaper / better quality. It’s like $9 for a matcha in Seattle.

 

\- DoorDash **fees**, have to be the highest I’ve ever seen. 

\- **Ubers** to the airport, $85 min. Yes - I know I can take the light rail but I’m often taking multiple suitcases and it’s hard to roll them down at 530am to the light rail.

 

\- **Police**, they don’t see to really enforce anything. I was hosting some business people from Seoul and a guy was doing crack outside the coffee shop we were at, the guys from Korea were like you should call the police - I was like “ya that’s not going to do anything here”. They couldn’t believe zit. 

\- **Crime**, seems to be up - shootings and robberies seem to happen more frequently in downtown.

**Some improvements** 

\- There are some new Cafes - Taz, JinJin etc 

\- Still seems to be a fair amount of tourists 

\- Super Bowl parade - wow, was so cool to see so many people in the city and the city was never cleaner

\- The new walking area by the pier  

Seattle could be a such a great city, I just wonder what it would take to actually improve. ",0,1771219122.0,Seattle,15,0.29,False

1r60sk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r60sk5/1_month_in_advice_needed/,1 month in - Advice needed,"Hey y’all,

So I’ve been seeing this girl for about a month now (both in our early 20s). We’ve met 4 times now: First date was coffee (about an hour), she reached out after the date and gave her number and said she had a good time. I planned for us to meet again a week later, and we had dinner. The most recents one were more candid, and she opened up about never being in a relationship before, is figuring out what she likes and dislikes in a partner and I said that I’m happy to take things at a pace that feels more comfortable to her. The latest one was on valentine’s day and i even brought her flowers. I like to think all the dates went well, and we’ve been planning the subsequent ones while still on the date for the last two times. For more context, We’ve had 0 physical intimacy except for an awkward kiss at the end of the last date.

Now, here’s my question: I clearly like her and I think she’s into me too. Our in-person dates are great, we have a lot in common and we can chat for long hours without running out of stuff. But here’s my problem: Ever since the second time we met, I’ve been asking her to stay in touch more in between dates since we don’t see each other more than once a week. She agrees every time, and then takes anywhere from 8hrs to a day to respond to messages.

I gave her the benefit of the doubt initially but I’ve communicated this thrice. Further, I’m not very experienced with relationships myself (i did mention this to her, I’ve only been in one relationship that lasted for about 6 months a few years ago), and I’m starting to think I might be putting too much into it for too little in return. She has no agency in planning dates, and has reached out via text exactly once over the past month. She doesn’t text me asking me about my day or whatever. There was one time when I just didn’t respond for 3 days and I received a single text. But, she seems very honest and candid in person (or maybe I can’t tell, idk), so i’m confused.

The two non negotiable(s) for me in a relationship are good communication and symmetric effort. I see none of these from her end and it’s been a month. Not to mention that I’d definitely want the physical intimacy aspect of it to move faster than barely a kiss in a month.

I need advice on whether I should give this more time or end things. On one hand, neither of us have serious experience dealing with a relationship so I feel i might be judging it harshly but on the other I’ve been explicit about my request a few times now. We haven’t talked about being exclusive yet but I think she mentioned she isn’t seeing anyone else. Most importantly, since I’m kinda figuring this out myself too, I’m not sure if I have the bandwidth to deal with someone who’s even more inexperienced than me. I’d love to hear insights from people who were in a similar situation and made it work/ended things

I (22f) was super happy for her and didn’t even think about all these details but recently she came to me and told me her best friend was going to be her maid of honor. Growing up (through teenage years) we always said we would be eachothers MOH but honestly as adults we aren’t very close and I didnt necessarily expect she would still want me to, but it still stung a tiny bit. 

Whatever, it’s her wedding and choice of course. After she said her best friend would be her MOH she said “but you could totally be a bridesmaid!” idk it just felt weird to me so I said no. It seemed like she was asking me to make up for not being her MOH? Or like she felt bad for me? I saw friends of hers posting the cute ways she asked them all to be bridesmaids (notes, flowers, coffee) but she kind of just threw it in there when she asked me (I had already seen a few of her friends post about being asked so it wasn’t like she had talked to me about it first and not had time to do something like that)

The truth is I know we aren’t close, and I don’t want to be in her wedding bc she feels obligated or guilty. It was awkward but I told her no thank you but I would love to come as a guest. Should I have just said yes? My parents think I was being mean.  The way she asked me literally seemed like an apology for not fulfilling our childhood promise and I just felt like an afterthought and uncomfortable like she was mentioning it to soften the blow I guess? 

I think it would have been really sweet if she just lead with asking me to be a bridesmaid or something. Idk. I think this whole thing has been blown out of proportion now, I didn’t think saying I would rather just be a guest was wrong but now i’m second guessing. ",0,1771218642.0,AITAH,3,0.5,False

I genuinely had a blast hanging out with them platonically but pretty much all our hang outs had some type of physical intimacy mixed in which was fine at first but started taking a toll on me mentally because this person had initiated wanting us to be friends only. They however would tell me how amazing and kind I am as well as saying things like how they hadn’t realized how much they missed me after going on a date. I started noticing how one sided it all was as I supported the dates they went on but anytime I mentioned someone I was interested in it always ended in a snarky reply or general hate about the person having known nothing about them. Fast forward, I have started rejecting any type of physical relationship with him now and meet an awesome person through my job who I instantly connected with. We exchanged socials and talked nonstop for a bit but i then found out he’s married which really threw me off. We were still messaging though after him telling me and although I was insanely attracted I knew I had to put a boundary in place. The next day on valentines I had told my situation-ship about it because it had been constantly in my mind and he immediately started making rude comments about him and his profession as well as the whole married situation in general. I felt so hurt because I truly felt a malicious intent behind his words and tried to switch the subject but he kept bringing it back up. I was so upset I showed him a picture from his social because I wanted him to know this was just a normal guy .There was no reason to be so mean and he even admitted the guy was attractive. This was all within probably a 20 min timeframe getting coffee. I gave him a little gift and card before he dropped me home and honestly knew that was it for us right then. I immediately went to text the other guy but discovered I had been blocked by him within those few minutes of showing my friend his profile. It was so confusing because he initiated almost all convos other than me asking to exchange socials and then out of the blue blocks me. I have no idea why and so many different scenarios in my head of what could have happened that lead to that. His wife is not living with him as he’s in my area for school and he also told me he was solo for the day so that one didn’t seem likely but I also can’t help but think my situation-ship messaged him because of how angry he got while we were having coffee. We follow each other on socials and he was being very weird on his phone during that as well which in the moment didn’t think much of. He has had weird behavior like that in the past like showing up with a date to an event I had constantly told him I was excited about going to which really hurt. I ended up blocking him same day just out of anger for everything he’s said to me but part of me feels I could be overreacting. Am I? Or is it just a crazy coincidence. The unknowing kills me and I don’t wanna ask him out of fear and because I feel our paths have finished crossing. ",1,1771218622.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Recently diagnosed and been on 20mg of Vyvanse for a few days now, with a 2 week window before upping the dose to 30mg. Doctor is strict on that. 

I don't think I can do 2 weeks of this. Let alone a few more days. 

I'm experiencing zero functional improvement, rather I just get a bit sleepy. Exact same feeling as having 2-4 coffees. No buzz. No anxiety. Just a bit foggy. 

Ive been taking it at 7am for my 8am start, and crashing horribly at midday on the dot. 

I've never been so irritable or angry it's bizarre and really frustrating. 

I'm afraid this will leak into my relationship and work performance. 

My doctor is away from the 20th to end of March with no appointments between now and then. 

I don't really know what to do. Just tough it out?

Is Vyvanse not for me or is it just too weak of a dose?

I feel like it's detrimental to my function if anything rather than improving. 

Any suggestions?

I've been eating 2 fried eggs prior to taking it. Protein bar on the drive to work. Followed by 750ml of strawberry nesquick/full cream milk to avoid coffee and get some extra protein into my stomach. 

Morning tea consists of 2 cans of tuna

Lunch is a toastie and some more tuna OR a protein bar. 

afternoon is followed with 2L of water and or berocca hydrate. 

I've been careful about my food intake, but I'm as hungry as ever tbh, I believe I'm getting enough protein. 

I'm craving nicotine which I quit 2 months ago. Last thing I need is to get back on the smokes too. ",2,1771218539.0,ausadhd,5,1.0,False

I’ve been experimenting with different pods, milk amounts and chocolate sources (squares, powder with sugar, powder with vanilla syrup, Starbucks cocoa powder, etc.).

I recently made some home made chocolate sauce (1/2 cup unsweetened dutch processed cocoa powder, 3/4 cup in the raw organic sugar, 1/2 cup water and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract) which turned out really well. Not too sweet, good chocolate flavor.

My question is: Do you prefer to pour the espresso shot over the chocolate, then add the frothed/heated milk (frother on latte setting) or do you prefer to mix the chocolate with the milk (frother on hot chocolate setting)  in the frother and then pour the espresso shot over THAT?

I’m using an inexpensive Zulay 4 in 1 frother. The latte setting has good foam, but is luke warm to me. The hot chocolate setting has much better warmth, but leas foam. The company recommends latte setting for latte and hot chocolate setting for “mocha coffee.” I was going to try the espresso shot over the chocolate and pour it into the heated milk (on hotter hot chocolate setting) to see how that turned out.

I want to make this extremely honest post. Outlining exactly what happened on Friday, because I need to lay everything out for myself and maybe get an honest opinion.

Background: I (30F) have been in a on again/off again relationship with someone (31M) that I like A LOT. It all started last year February with a friendship, but became more by April. I had just come out of a bad situation with an ex the December before.

We’ve known each other for years. When we started talking last year, we lived 4 hours apart. So I went to see him in July. While there, we had a small fight, but even during this small fight the one thing I will never forget is how he kept interrupting me when it was my turn to speak.

We kept talking on the phone after that and I moved 2 hours closer. I finally got a rental in the town I loved and since I work from home, I took it.

He was supposed to come visit, but cancelled multiple times. By the third cancellation in mid-September, I broke things off.

He reached out again in November. He always wanted to move to the area where I lived, technically he always wanted a place in the City about 1.5 hours South of where I live. But after looking at prices, the town I’m in has significantly lower rent and is much safer.

He decided to take a house here. He wanted to try and sort things out. He was to move in January. He came through in December to check out a house and when I brought up how he had cancelled, we had a small disagreement… but we talked it out.

He asked for my help with the move since I have a bigger car. I drove 2 hours to help him, and while I was there, there was another fight… this time it was very apparent that he was the type of person that would refuse to acknowledge the other person’s point of view. The fight started because we went to a drive-through for food, he ordered for me and I tried to interject that I wanted something different. I tried telling him 3 times… he didn’t acknowledge me and just ordered what he wanted. When we drove off I told him that I wanted something else and that I tried telling him 3 times… he got really angry… he turned the car around on the main road and drove back (even though I said it was fine) and ordered what I wanted.

When we got back to his place he was so angry that he wouldn’t come sit and eat, he just kept packing angrily. And even when I tried to help he just was slamming doors shut and ignoring me. I got uncomfortable and tried to bring it up, but he just adamantly said that I wouldn’t speak to him like that. I tried to defend myself and he wouldn’t let me finish speaking. I tried a few more times but he just kept talking over me, making sure I couldn’t finish a single point I was trying to make.

I have pretty bad anxiety so this made me have a panic attack. He left to his room and I went to the spare bedroom to calm down. When I did I went to his room and he started talking. He told me off basically for trying to interrupt him while ordering and for making a big deal about gravy (the biggest difference between the two orders was that the one he made had an extra wrap and the one I wanted had gravy instead). When I tried to make my point he again assumed what I was going to say, cut me off and wouldn’t let me speak. I got so anxious again… and then angry and I threw a waterbottle on the ground. Looking back I actually think he wanted that to happen, because this did give him all the leverage he wanted because now… I was screaming and throwing things and he was just innocent. He instantly turned into the sad guy that wanted to be heard and acted all wounded. I let it go and left soon after, my car packed with his stuff. (During the move he packed most of his plants, and one of his Bonsai trees ended up getting damaged in the move. I’ll get back to that)

He did apologise. And then he moved and he was picture perfect. We just started hanging out and I showed him the town.

He treated me well, we didn’t fight. He took me to nice places, made me food, we would have coffee in between work and two weeks in it was almost Valentines.

I also did a lot of effort for him. I would go to see him inbetween work regularly, I’d take him food and snacks…

The story of what happened on Friday:

So, this is the biggy! He had let me know that he had made huge plans for Valentines! He had booked a restaurant and had even bought me a gift! The day before Valentines though… Everything got flipped upside down….

We were out for lunch and on the way back I mentioned how I would like hot chocolate. He said he had some had home and that he would make us some. We got home and he took all of the ingredients for hot chocolate out and put it on tje counter. He then sat down, I sat with him. He then asked me to go make the hot chocolate.

I jokingly said that he said he would. He was fuming.

He said he had been doing everything for me and I should have at least done one thing for him. The night before I drove all the way from my house to bring him food and an energy drink. I didn’t understand what he meant, but almost instantly when I tried to tell him that he was wrong he not only interrupted me but started bringing up one time that I left my coffee mug on the coffee table. i tried again to defend myself but then he brought up the plant that got damaged in the move.

Again, I could barely get a word in! He went on a 10 minute monologue about being raised right and then gestured for me to respond. When my response was to try and defend myself he just shut me down and started explaining again why I was wrong and he was right. The anxiety of not even being able to finish one point even after he made 10 took over and I started yelling. I just wanted him to let me speak. Again, even though at this point he called me delusional, childish and even evil for not even doing this one small thing for him, me getting loud was enough for him and he asked me to leave his house. I just wanted to at least say one full sentence before I left and he decided that I wouldn’t so he grabbed me by the arm and pulled me. I scraped my leg and it started bleeding. He locked me out of his house and there was blood running down my leg.

I left and he started messsaging me saying how I broke him and took everything from him and “made him less of a man” since he had to hurt me.

I apologised. But he kept throwing insults. The next day was Valentines. I had ordered him a gift earlier in the week. A balloon bouquet and a small tree with pink flowers. He told me to come get my things that were still there. I took the gift with. He threw my stuff and the gift on the ground. He wouldn’t let me speak, told me how evil I was and that I was unsafe…

He closed the door in my face and locked it. I picked the little tree off of the ground and left. (Don’t worry the tree deserved better! She is in my garden and I will make sure she is taken care of! I also gave the balloons to my elderly neighbour and she loved them!!! ☺️)

When I left I blocked his number and went home. He messaged me from a different number that I was an evil person and a coward that broke him and then ran off. I simply told him that I didn’t run off, he chased me away… finally typed out everything he wouldn’t let me say and blocked that number too.

I am not sad about him but I am angry that he even moved here. I moved here for a fresh start and I feel like it was all part of his intentional plan to move here. He tested me once or twice, saw how forgiving I was. Moved here knowing that he could use it against me and couldn’t even wait more than two weeks without acting this horribly.

I really want him to go away now.

Clarification: we both have good jobs, both work from home so can work from anywhere.

I also know this wasn’t about the “hot chocolate”, it was about control. He wanted me to do what he asked and when I didn’t he became angry enough to blow everything up.

I probably shouldn’t even have given him the time of day in November, I can see that now.",1,1771218156.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I'm an INTP and she knows this. I'm super analytical and stoic but can be more goofy around her. We don't text that much tho, only lately, but still not as much as probably with her close friends. Same for in class but she does hover near me and stuff. Most of our stuff comes from group hangouts.

I can't tell if she's started being interested lately. Like she was leaning super close to me in class, or when hanging in groups she sometimes leaves her knee on mine or will squeeze against me when looking at someone phone (like cheek against my arm), or other small touches. I recently started wearing a bandana and our teacher gave a compliment and she remembered it 2 weeks later and called it ""a look"", and when someone's parent complimented me she said it looked ""cute"" but kinda quietly. She also reacts to my messages in groupchats with emojis a lot. Glances at me a lot, fawned a bit over seeing photos of younger me.

Offered to review my artwork to give tips after our art teacher verbally ripped my artwork apart. She got super insistent on paying me back for the coffee I bought her when in a group activity. It was like $6 tho so I told her it was no prob but she brought it up later and settled on buying for me next time. We also get along a lot, talking about topics and interests and views and stuff. She does poke a lot of fun at me a lot always saying my name and some joke or poking fun at my habits. She seems fine though when I check up on her if shes feeling uncomfy in situations and stuff. She even said yes to my birthday party invite ""yeah yeah ofcc. Any day works"".

Idk, maybe she just wants to be close friends and repair any old awkwardness, or maybe now that we are older we've both changed and she wants to try again.

Does she like me back or am I misreading? Idk, Reddit I turn to you for guidance!!",1,1771217959.0,isfp,3,1.0,False

I’m a beginner and recently started enjoying my coffee black. I’ve been using Blue Tokai ground coffee with their drip filter papers (the ones you place on top of a cup and pour hot water through, similar to a pour over)

I’m now looking to upgrade my brewing method, but I’m confused between the Aeropress and the V60 with a budget of about 5k. I already have a kitchen scale, so measuring won't be an issue.

Which one would be better for a beginner who mainly drinks black coffee? I’m looking for something that produces consistently good results and also helps me improve over time.

Thanks!",6,1771217894.0,IndiaCoffee,16,1.0,False

There are countless manifestation rules and all sorts of things!

I had a clear thought today, and it might help you too!

I've always wondered, if I am the Divine Essence, why do I have to follow rules when manifesting, like how I should formulate things or anything like that?


I can decide for myself how I formulate things, or whether I visualize them very intensely or only briefly!

Basically, we can and should set the rules ourselves in our reality!


Why make it complicated when there's an easier way!


And we're talking about the Law of Assumption, for example, isn't it also an assumption if I say, ""Oh, XYZ has contacted me now,"" instead of saying, ""Oh, XYZ will contact me now""?


```
I hope you understand what I'm getting at!

I've had a few situations where I simply said, ""Oh, today I'm getting a coffee for free,"" instead of saying, ""Oh, I was given a coffee for free today!""


You don't really need to use the past tense! I find, and have often experienced, that when I say, ""Oh, I'm getting this,"" it actually happened. It feels more natural to me than saying, ""I received it."" And even though I was speaking more in the future tense, I already had a mental image of it!


And the idea that there's no past and future, which is often said, since there's only the present!



Why shouldn't you do that, as if it depends on the wording? But like I said, I've often had situations where, instead of saying ""I'm getting this,"" it still happened!


And since we possess the Divine Essence, what matters more are the rules we have, because we're talking about the Law of Assumption! So if I assume that it's better for me this way, then that will be reflected back to me!


These so-called manifestation rules that everyone in the community swears by are just assumptions!


It's the same with time and how!

Can't I decide when and how it comes?

Why shouldn't I be able to decide that?

And I've read many success stories about time, where many people have managed to manifest at the exact moment! I mean, manifestation is always instantaneous, and if you have the Divine Essence, why shouldn't you be able to do that?

Whether I can manifest when and how is also an assumption!

Above all, you're worth it!

And it's also a kind of limitation if I'm not allowed to decide when and how!

And it's said that one is and should be unlimited when manifesting!


Of course, one should have value, or rather, be worth it! That's why I asked myself the question, and for some, it turned out exactly the same! Because they were worth it to themselves!


And I've often read that they believed in themselves and said, for example, that their manifestation would arrive by the end of the week! And it happened exactly as they said!


And that is being! God's essence without any limitations!


What do you think?

What experiences have you had?
