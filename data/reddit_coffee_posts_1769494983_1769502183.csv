Elliot wiped down the counter for the third time in as many minutes. The fluorescent lights flickered like a dying firefly, and the hum of the old refrigerators sounded suspiciously like whispered warnings. Another slow night at Point Pleasant Quick Stop, just him, the fluorescent buzz, and the faint scent of stale hot dogs.

A little boy ran in, tugging on his mother’s sleeve. “I dropped it!” he cried, holding up a frayed action figure.

Elliot knelt, smiling. “Don’t worry, buddy. Where’d the rest go?”

The boy pointed toward the parking lot. Elliot followed his gaze. The action figure was squashed flat under the tire of a departing car.

“Uh…” Elliot’s stomach gave a little flip. Something about the timing—too precise, too… Mothman-ish.

“Just a toy, Elliot,” said Mrs. Crenshaw from aisle three, waving him off as she stocked canned beans. “Kids drop stuff all the time.”

He nodded, forcing a smile. “Yeah, just a toy…” But the seed was planted. A tiny tragedy, but something gnawed at the edges of his mind.

He stacked some candy bars, then noticed a cat dart across the lot. It froze, arched its back, and… didn’t move again.

Elliot froze. “Nope. Nope. Nope.”

A shiver ran down his spine. He whispered to himself, “Mothman.” The word tasted heavy, like ash.

He glanced at the clock. Three minutes until his break. Three minutes to convince himself the universe wasn’t out to get him…

And maybe, just maybe, he’d finally start watching the parking lot more closely.

Elliot swung his backpack over his shoulder and stepped out into the cool evening. Mrs. Crenshaw waved from the doorway, and his manager, Mr. Harlan, called after him.

“Keep your chin up, Elliot! Maybe you’ll see Mothman tonight!” he added with a wink, like it was some long-running inside joke.

Elliot forced a laugh. “Ha. Yeah… sure.”

He hopped on his rusty old bike, pedaling down the nearly-empty streets of Point Pleasant. The sunset painted everything in a soft orange glow, but his thoughts were darker—tiny tragedies, the squashed toy, the dead cat, the creeping feeling that maybe something was following him.

A few blocks later, a crowd had gathered near the intersection. Yellow tape fluttered in the wind. A car had crashed into a tree, smoke curling from the crumpled hood.

Elliot slowed, heart thumping. He overheard a police officer talking to a firefighter.

“…so EMS takes the driver, PD secures the scene,” the officer explained calmly.

Elliot squinted into the shadows at the edge of the wreck, and his blood ran cold.

Perched on a streetlight, just barely visible in the dim, flickering glow of emergency lights, were two glowing red eyes. Massive wings folded like a cloak around a dark, impossibly tall figure.

“Moth… Mothman?” Elliot whispered under his breath, wobbling on his bike.

Panic flared. His knees trembled. He was that cowardly little dog that sees a thunderstorm and freezes in place.

The figure shifted—then, vanished, an officer caught Elliot’s  eye. They couldn’t see the fear on his face.  They leaned down as if inspecting him. “Kid… get out of here, yah rascal,”  their voice rumbled, deep but playfully. 

Elliot stumbled backward, tripping over his own pedals, nearly crashing into a fire hydrant. “I—I’m going!” he stammered, turning his bike around in a frenzy.

As he pedaled away, heart hammering, Mothman’s presence lingered at the edge of the wreck, wings shifting, silent, watching… and somehow, Elliot was even more convinced this thing wasn’t just some story

Elliot pedaled home as fast as his legs would carry him, heart still hammering from the wreck. The streetlights flickered overhead, shadows stretching long and strange across the pavement. Every tree branch seemed to twitch, every dark corner to hold a pair of glowing red eyes.

He slowed near the corner store where he usually bought snacks—just to catch his breath—but froze when movement caught his eye.

There, on the roof across the street, perched silently in the dim glow of a flickering neon sign, were two eyes. Red. Watching him. Wings folded tight, blending into the night, the creature unmoving but somehow alive.

Elliot swallowed hard. His hands trembled on the handlebars. “No… no, it’s nothing,” he whispered. The rational part of his brain argued maybe it’s a crow, maybe a trick of the light. But even as he thought it, his stomach twisted with dread.

The next block offered no relief. A neighbor’s dog ran barking into the street, slipping on a patch of wet asphalt. Elliot stopped, watching helplessly as it yelped and retreated under the porch. And just for a heartbeat there glimpsed through the trees, two red dots reflected in the darkness. Mothman. Always just out of full view.

He spun his bike around and pedaled faster, cursing under his breath. Every rustle of leaves, every shadow shifting in the periphery of his vision, became a sign. Small tragedies, big tragedies was this thing following him? Watching him?

By the time he reached his apartment, Elliot was convinced of one thing: he wasn’t safe. Mothman was everywhere, yet nowhere he could truly see. His own reflection in the window of the bike shop seemed to mock him, a thin, pale figure, eyes wide, imagining monsters in every corner.

And maybe, just maybe, the monsters weren’t even imaginary

Elliot didn’t sleep much. When he did, it came in short, panicked bursts. Dreams of red eyes blinking open in the dark, wings folding and unfolding like a bad thought he couldn’t finish.

Morning came anyway.

He got dressed for work with shaking hands, double‑checked the locks, stared at himself in the bathroom mirror longer than necessary.

Just a bad night, he told his reflection. You’re fine. You’re normal.

The ride to the store felt heavier than usual. No eyes in the trees. No shadows moving wrong. That almost made it worse.

When Elliot walked into the Quick Stop, the mood hit him immediately. The chatter was gone. Even the radio was turned down low. Mr. Harlan stood behind the counter, eyes red, jaw tight.

“Morning,” Elliot said softly.

Harlan nodded. “You hear about the wreck last night?”

Elliot’s throat tightened. He nodded. “Yeah.”

“Driver was my cousin,” Harlan said after a moment. “Good guy.”

“I’m… I’m sorry,” Elliot said. He almost mentioned the shadow on the streetlight. Almost said I saw something. The words died in his mouth. This wasn’t the time. He swallowed them down.

Work dragged. Customers whispered. Coffee went untouched. Every time Elliot glanced toward the windows, he expected to see red eyes staring back, but there was nothing. Just his own reflection, pale and tired.

On break, he sat outside on a milk crate, knees bouncing. That’s when Wicken joined him, black lipstick already smudged, pentagram necklace catching the light. She smelled faintly of clove cigarettes and incense.

“You look like you saw a ghost,” she said cheerfully.

“More like… a cryptid,” Elliot muttered.

Her eyes lit up. “Oh my god. Tell me.”

He shouldn’t have. He knew that. But he did anyway. The wreck. The shadows. The eyes. The pattern. Wicken listened, chin in her hands, smiling wider with every word.

“Mothman doesn’t cause disasters,” she said finally. “He just shows up before them. Like an omen.”

Elliot frowned. “That’s… worse.”

She laughed. “Yeah. Kinda is.”

Then she tilted her head, studying him. “You ever notice you’re kinda like that too?”

Elliot blinked. “What?”

“I mean,” she said lightly, “you’re always around when weird stuff happens. You were here for the toy thing. The cat. The wreck. You see it before everyone else does.” She shrugged. “Maybe you’re just sensitive.”

His brain stalled. A hard, grinding reboot.

Always there.

Always watching.

Never stopping it.

The rest of the shift passed in a blur.

That evening, as Elliot walked his bike home, smoke rose in the distance thick, black, wrong. A house fire. Sirens screamed past him. People gathered, pointing, crying.

The flames roared, devouring the house with casual hunger.

And there framed by firelight, standing motionless on a nearby rooftop … was Mothman.

Wings folded. Eyes glowing. Silent.

Elliot didn’t run.

He didn’t look away.

He just stared back, chest tight, heart aching not with fear this time, but recognition. The creature wasn’t following him. It wasn’t stalking him.

It was mirroring him.

Two omens standing on opposite sides of the same tragedy, watching and unable to stop a thing

Elliot didn’t sleep again that night. Not properly, anyway. Every creak in his apartment, every shadow cast by the flickering streetlight outside, felt like a signal. A warning.

He sat on the edge of his bed, knees drawn up, staring at the ceiling as though it might speak the truth to him. It’s me. It’s me. It’s me.

The house fire from the night before replayed in his mind in jagged, stop‑motion loops. The flames, the crowd, the sirens—and those glowing red eyes. Not terrifying now. Not threatening. Judging. Waiting. Knowing.

I’m always there, he thought. I’m always there before it happens. I can’t stop it. I am it.

He tried to convince himself it was coincidence. Patterns trick the brain. Humans see connections where none exist.

Wrong.

He had a list now: the toy, the cat, the wreck, the fire. And every time, he’d been there. The tiniest tragedies, escalating like a crescendo and somehow, he always knew first. Always watching. Always present.

He walked through his apartment like a ghost, checking corners, counting shadows. Anything that moved was suspect. Every sound was amplified the hum of the fridge, the creak of the floorboards. Every flicker of light painted a crimson reflection in his mind. He’s there.

By mid-morning, Elliot was convinced of it. The label had settled on him, heavy as lead:

“Elliot: Omen.”

The word echoed in his head, punctuating every thought. Everything that happens, I’m there first. Everything that falls apart, I’m there to see it. I’m the harbinger.

Even his coworkers noticed. He’d stopped making small talk. Stopped joking. Eyes darted, constantly scanning for… something he couldn’t name. He didn’t trust himself. He didn’t trust reality. And every “coincidence” now felt like proof:

Mrs. Crenshaw dropped a can. Omen.

A car backfired outside. Omen.

Wicken laughed too loudly at a joke. Omen.

The world had become a stage of tiny tragedies—and Elliot, unwilling actor and reluctant witness, realized he was the star of every scene.

By lunchtime, he barely moved. He ate mechanically, half-chewing, half-staring at the door as if expecting Mothman to appear in the fluorescent hum of the break room. He didn’t speak. Didn’t react. Just… existed, a walking symbol of impending misfortune.

He thought about quitting, about leaving Point Pleasant, about running to some empty town where no one knew the patterns. But deep down, he knew: wherever he went, he’d carry the curse. The sighting, the pattern, the omens—they weren’t just around him anymore. They were him.

When Wicken popped her head into the break room later, she stopped, noticing the hollowed, haunted way he stared at the floor. She didn’t say anything. Just smirked knowingly, a little nod.

And Elliot, finally, allowed himself a small, bitter laugh.

Yes, he thought. I am the omen. The harbinger. The thing that comes before the bad. The walking sign of disaster. And there’s nothing anyone can do about it.

He got up, shoulders slumped, eyes glazed. Another day of work ahead. Another day of watching, waiting, cataloging misfortune.

And in the corner of his mind, the shadow of red eyes and folded wings waited too, patient as ever

Elliot moved through the store like a ghost. Shelves were alphabetized, counters wiped clean for the hundredth time, registers checked twice. He felt hollow inside, a walking harbinger cataloging misfortune, mind buzzing with shadows of red eyes and folded wings.

“Elliot!” Mr. Harlan’s voice cut through the monotony. “New hire’s in the break room. You’re gonna train him—and I think you’re gonna like him!”

Elliot blinked, frozen mid‑sweep. “Uh… wha—new hire?”

“Yeah!” Harlan said with a grin. “Go on, show him the ropes.”

Elliot’s legs felt like lead as he approached the break room door. He exhaled shakily and slowly turned the handle.

And there… standing behind the small counter in the uniform Elliot had worn a thousand times… was Mothman.

The wings were folded neatly behind him, just enough to brush the ceiling. The red eyes glowed faintly in the harsh fluorescent light. The posture was… unsettling. Too still. Too patient.

Elliot’s mouth opened. Closed. He stuttered. “I-I… you… how…?”

Harlan leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, expression perfectly calm. “I thought Mothman was your friend?”

Elliot gawked. “Friend? He’s… he’s—he’s terrifying! He—he watches everything! He’s an omen! He—he’s—”

Harlan waved a hand dismissively. “I know he looks a little strange. But you don’t judge a man or a cryptid by his skin, or feathers, or glowing eyes. You judge him by the contents of his heart. And Mothman? He just wants to earn a decent living.”

Elliot’s jaw went slack. His brain short-circuited. Mothman just… stood there. Waiting. Calm. Not the predator he’d imagined. Not the herald of tragedy. Just… a guy in a uniform.

Harlan’s voice softened, almost with pride. “I’ve helped all kinds of folks around here hiring Wicken, giving you a shot, letting in all the little freaks nobody else wants. Mothman’s just… small potatoes compared to the rest of ya’ll.”

Elliot finally found his voice, shakier than he’d like. “…You… you really think he belongs here?”

Harlan smiled. “Elliot, if he’s willing to learn, he belongs anywhere he wants. And you well, you trained people like him before. You know the drill.”

Mothman shifted slightly, a wing brushing the break room wall. The red eyes softened as he looked at Elliot. No malice. No judgement. Just… acknowledgment.

Elliot’s chest tightened. He felt the collapse of paranoia inside him, the weight of imagined curses, omens, and tragedies lifting just a little.

And then, despite himself, a small laugh escaped. “I… I guess… okay,” he muttered. “I’ll… train you.”

Mothman tilted his head, folding his wings neatly, waiting. And for the first time in weeks, Elliot felt like maybe, just maybe, the omens weren’t entirely his burden after all",1,1769500751.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

My best friend, my love, my everything. I wish that everyday I could go to your house and beg for you back. I know it would never work, but id go through the humiliation ritual every second of my life if it had any chance of bringing you back. I know why. I won't pretend I don't. I saw it coming. Its why I was panicking. But at the same time I don't know why. Why did you have to give up? I still remember our last phone call and I play it in my head everyday. I remember the moment I knew you'd made up your mind. I wish that in my panicked state I had the clarity of mind to do the right things. Im sorry I wasn't acting right, but I felt neglected, you didn't seem to care about me anymore and it was breaking my heart. So yes, I left that night coldly. I didn't give you a hug and kiss, and I'll never forgive myself for it. You said that made you realize something. I didn't mean for that. Your coldness was breaking me and I wanted to make you feel like the way I had been feeling for months. You denying me anything more than a kiss. Like we hadn't been together for three years already. I felt so lonely, I missed your warm love. It panicked me when you'd pull away like I was a stranger. I had to even tell you to be sure you said ""I love you"" back. I know you weren't in love with me anymore. But I couldn't ever feel that way. I could never let you go. To this day, I can't let you go. I could read you well, no matter how much you'd deny anything was wrong. I knew you too well. I knew you would do it and I lived in fear everyday would be the day you broke my heart. The day that happened, I remember trying to make one final play, one last try. I said ""let me pick up my stuff"". There it was. Just my PS4 in my backpack sitting on your porch. When I went to tell you that there was more, you'd already blocked me on everything. In under ten minutes. When I rang the doorbell, your dad came out. He was the only person on your side that seemed to even care. I wish he'd dragged you out so I could just try to talk you out of this. He told me to come back in a month when you would have changed your mind. He told me come back anytime, that he'd gladly get coffee with me or something. I relive this day in my memory like it just happened to me. Losing you forever. I was certain it wasn't forever. That your dad was right and you'd change your mind. But days, weeks, months and years have passed and the message is clear. You're never coming back. Everyone just told me to move on with my life. It's not that simple. You don't just ""move on"" from you. To be with you is to live and breathe you. To be with you requires life to revolve around you. To be yours requires being cognizant of how every action and every word effects you. To be with you requires that one love you to your core. To be with you requires see past the veil and to know exactly whats going on inside of your head. If only I could put into words at the time that you were the center of my universe. That you mattered to me more than anything. That my day didn't truly start until I was hanging out with you. I wish I could've shoved my desire for you down. I wish when I was next to you in bed that I didn't feel my body's need for yours. I just wanted the whole you back. It had been seven months since you even entertained it. And im sorry, but everytime we'd cuddle and youd bat my hand away from you boob, like we were just friends. It broke my heart. When you didn't even want to shower with me anymore, when you wouldnt touch me, or let me touch you. I felt neglected. I'm sorry that I kept bringing it up, but all I wanted was to feel intimacy with you again. I wanted what we had before. The non-stop love and affection we once had felt permanently lost. It was. You didn't even do the basics anymore. You told me to just live with it. That intimacy was off the table and to leave if I didnt like it. But you know just as much as I do that leaving you was a task I could never do, and never willingly let you do. I guess you'd finally had enough of me trying to love you. I'm sorry for trying. Watching you dissociate in my arms, say that you didnt care anymore, shut down when I wanted to fix things. I don't know why to this day im still so hung up on you. By all metrics I shouldn't care, but I cant bring myself to let you go. Not for a second. In your absence I'll cry. I'll still feel the deep gut wrenching feeling that you're gone. I'll still miss my best friend. No one has ever known me like you do. No one ever listened and understood me like you do. I hope one day I can go back in time and just relive a weekend when you still loved me again. My own slice of heaven that I can't ever seem to get back. Nothing can replace that. Not even someone new as I've come to find out. I can live with her, but I want you. I can look at it objectively and say its better. But I still want you. Everyone can tell me how much more they like her over you and it wont change my mind. You're still what I want. When I said ""I love you forever"", I meant that. I meant every word of love I ever gave you. You can leave, you can crush me, you can destroy my very soul and I'll still want you. That's what I mean when I say forever. I know all things in this world are temporary, but I was holding out the vein hope that you were permanent. That you'd never leave. Im sorry I couldn't hold it together anymore. Im sorry I panicked and made it worse like I always do. Im sorry, and I beg for your forgiveness that I know you're not capable of giving. All these years later and im still the same. Crying in my room writing pages and pages about you. How much I miss you, and how broken my heart is. Nothing can ever be the same again. No one can fill the void you've left. I feel like im stuck here forever. I feel like im forever owned by you because I just cant let you go. I don't want to continue without you, but its already the reality and has been for years. I stil cant accept it. I dont want to. I dont want to believe it. Im still panicking over whats already said and done. Until we meet again love, I'll be waiting, as I have been since the day I lost you. ",1,1769500577.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1qo7out,https://tintwotin.itch.io/watching-paint-dry,Watching Paint Dry - An existential idle game about finding the profound in the mundane.,"**They say it’s like watching paint dry. We took that literally.**

At first, it seems like a joke. A blank wall. A magnifying glass. Your only task is to observe. You find a crack, a fleck of dust, a slight discoloration. You click. You gain **Focus**.

But then, something changes.

*Watching Paint Dry* is an experimental, philosophical idle game that transforms a mundane task into a meditative journey of self-discovery. As your Focus grows, you don't just buy faster clicks; you invest in **Perceptual Acuity**, **Mental Fortitude**, and even **Transcendent Insights**.

The wall is not static. It lives and breathes with a full **day/night cycle** that affects what you can see. Your own **alertness** wanes, forcing you to rest or brew a cup of coffee to continue your vigil. At night, a torch is your only guide to the wall's deepest secrets.

This is not a game about numbers going up. It's a game about what happens in the quiet moments. Through **philosophical musings** and contemplative questions, the game invites you to look inward.

I skipped the Santorinis and Positanos this time—not because I’m edgy, but because I physically could not deal with another selfie stick to the eye. Instead, I chased down villages that don’t show up on most “Top 10 Europe” lists, and honestly… it ruined the famous spots for me forever.

This is messy, first-person, and based on things that actually happened—including one “oh shit” moment involving a cliff, a goat, and my very bad Italian.

# 1. Kotor Old Town outskirts (Montenegro)

Everyone crowds Dubrovnik. I stayed 15 minutes outside Kotor, up a stone road that smelled like fig trees and diesel.

**Story:**  
On my first night, a local guy named Marko poured me rakija at 11am “for digestion.” I laughed. He didn’t. By noon I was emotionally attached to his cat and reconsidering my life choices. At sunset, church bells echoed off the bay, and the water went pink. I sat on the stone steps near Trg od Oružja and felt that rare “I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be” calm.

**Practical:**

* Guesthouse: \~$45/night
* Food: $20–30/day
* Bus from Dubrovnik: \~$18
* Safety: Watch pickpockets near cruise ship hours



# 2. Albarracín, Spain

Pink stone walls, medieval vibes, zero tour buses after 5pm.

**Story:**  
I got lost on Calle Azagra (every street looks like a postcard), heard kids playing soccer somewhere below, and followed the smell of wood smoke to a tiny bar. The bartender refused my broken Spanish and switched to slow, patient hand gestures. Best lamb stew of my life. I nearly cried into it.

**Practical:**

* Stay: \~$60/night
* Food: $25/day
* Rent a car; buses are limited
* Google Translate saved me daily

# 3. Piran (Slovenia)

Venice without the chaos.

**Story:**  
Woke up to seagulls screaming like they were late for work. Swam before breakfast. Slipped on algae-covered steps and absolutely ate it in front of three elderly women who clapped when I stood up. Humbling.

**Practical:**

* Apartments: \~$70/night
* Food: $25–35/day
* Cashless everywhere in 2026—no ATM stress

# 4. Bacharach (Germany)

Rhine Valley fairy tale nobody talks about enough.

**Story:**  
Rode a bike along the river in misty rain, castles peeking through fog. I sang loudly with AirPods in, didn’t realize they’d disconnected, and a passing couple applauded sarcastically. Peak Europe moment.

**Practical:**

* Stay: \~$65/night
* Train via DB app
* Food: $30/day
* Book trains early for savings



# 5. Civita di Bagnoregio outskirts (Italy)

Yes, the famous bridge town is crowded—but stay outside it.

**Oh shit moment:**  
I took a “shortcut” trail at dusk. Wrong trail. Ended up staring at a steep drop, shoes sliding on gravel. Sat down, laughed nervously, and waited until another hiker helped me back up. Ego bruised, legs shaking.

**Practical:**

* Stay nearby: \~$55/night
* Food: $25/day
* Don’t hike alone at sunset (learn from me)

# 6. Monsanto (Portugal)

Houses literally wedged between boulders.

**Story:**  
Wind howled through stone alleys like a movie soundtrack. An old woman named Teresa invited me in for coffee because “you look cold and lost.” She was correct on both counts.

**Practical:**

* Stay: \~$50/night
* Food: $20–25/day
* Rental car helps a lot

# 7. Štanjel (Slovenia)

Stone, silence, and wine.

**Story:**  
I spent an entire afternoon doing nothing but listening to bees and writing in a notebook I hadn’t opened in years. Didn’t check my phone once. Emotional reset I didn’t know I needed.

**Practical:**

* Stay: \~$60/night
* Food: $25/day
* Buy local wine—cheaper than water in some cafés

# 8. Rupit (Catalonia, Spain)

Wooden bridge, waterfalls, storybook stuff.

**Story:**  
Rain poured, smelled like wet leaves and moss. I slipped, soaked my socks, and a shop owner dried them with a hairdryer while lecturing me lovingly. Europe in a nutshell.

**Practical:**

* Stay: \~$70/night
* Food: $30/day
* Go midweek to avoid domestic tourists

# 9. Giethoorn outskirts (Netherlands)

Skip the center. Stay where locals live.

**Story:**  
Woke to ducks quacking under my window. Rented a bike, got lost on purpose, ended up sharing cheese with a farmer who thought Americans were all from Texas. I did not correct him.

**Practical:**

* Stay: \~$75/night
* Bike rental: \~$10/day
* Quiet hours respected—don’t be loud

# 10. Sighişoara outskirts (Romania)

Medieval without the crowds.

**Story:**  
Clock tower bells at noon. Kids laughing in the citadel. Ate papanasi (fried dough + sour cream) until regret set in. Zero regrets later.

**Practical:**

* Stay: \~$40–50/night
* Food: $15–20/day
* Extremely safe, but streets get icy in winter

# 2026 Stuff You Actually Need to Know

* **ETIAS**: Rolling out for many non-EU travelers. €7 fee, apply online before flying.
* **Apps I used daily**: Google Maps (offline), Google Translate, Omio, Wise.
* **Money**: Smaller villages still like cash—carry €50–100 just in case.
* **Booking cheaper**: Book trains 6–8 weeks out, stay just outside famous centers, eat where menus aren’t in 4 languages.

1qo7dbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1qo7dbt/full_storyneed_outside_opinions/,Full story-need outside opinions,"I need some neutral opinions because I feel stuck in my own head.

This girl and I are classmates at university (F 23, M 23) and we’re both studying physiotherapy. We get along very easily and have good chemistry in conversation. I’m generally a friendly person and I tend to click with people naturally, so at first I didn’t think much of it. From the outside, it honestly looks like she probably just sees me as a colleague/friend and doesn’t want anything romantic with me.

Last Thursday we met for coffee. After that, she texted me and suggested that I come over to her place so we could work on our theses and help each other. She said it was fine because her boyfriend was currently in Lithuania. During texting, she also complained about him a bit: that he doesn’t compliment her, that I compliment her more than he does, and she used a tired/annoyed emoji.

I offered to come in the morning, but she suggested the afternoon instead, saying it would be calmer and we’d have peace. She made it sound like we’d be alone (later I found out her younger brother was home but stayed in his room). She even apologized in messages for the situation and ended with something like “we’ll still see each other again anyway, right?”

When I came over, she was very welcoming: made cappuccino, brought fruit and homemade pastries, showed me her room, very warm and personal atmosphere. We worked on our theses and talked a lot. At one point I asked if her boyfriend knew I was there. She said yes, casually.

She then mentioned wanting to take a massage course and said I already had one, so she asked me to check her back for muscle knots. As physiotherapists, this didn’t feel completely out of context, but it was still quite intimate. She lay down and I gave her a short massage. During that, the conversation again shifted to her boyfriend: how long he’s away, how he doesn’t compliment her, how she told him she needs that and he brushed it off. I told her she deserves someone who appreciates her more, and she agreed, saying women are more sentimental and need that kind of attention.

She also said something like “you’ve helped me so much, I’ll probably have to cook you lunch or dinner sometime.” At one point I helped fasten her bra, she laughed and didn’t set any boundary. When I was leaving, she asked if I needed navigation home. I jokingly said “what if I stayed over?” She laughed and said her boyfriend would kill her if that happened — not that she didn’t want it, but that it would be a problem because of him.

After that, she kept asking about my schedule and comparing it with hers, like checking when we could see each other again. We loosely agreed to go running together on Sunday. She also compared me to her boyfriend again: how I take care of my health, how he eats badly, doesn’t exercise anymore, and how they’ve argued about it before.

At the same time, looking at this rationally, it really seems like she doesn’t actually want anything romantic with me and sees me as a friend/colleague she feels safe with. That’s part of what makes this confusing.

I haven’t sent her any message yet, but the situation started messing with my head. I like her too much to be “just friends”, and staying close while she has a boyfriend feels unhealthy for me. Being nice and staying involved makes it worse for me, but ghosting or being rude also feels wrong.

So my dilemma is:

	•	Does this look like emotional boundary crossing from her side, or am I overthinking normal friendly behavior?

	•	Is it reasonable to step back even if she probably means well and just sees me as a friend?

	•	Is there a respectful way to handle this without hurting her or myself?

	•	Or is this simply a situation where no one is really at fault, but distance is still the right move?

Thirty-four isn’t old, not really—but it felt ancient when every relationship milestone existed only as a checklist of things I’d never done. No first love, no disastrous breakup, no ex I pretended not to miss. Just work, sleep, repeat. Friends drifted away into marriages and mortgages while I stayed behind, perfectly preserved in loneliness.

That’s how I ended up downloading the app.

I told myself it was temporary. A curiosity. Something to fill the silence between midnight and exhaustion. I chose my photos carefully—nothing too desperate, nothing too posed. A smile that didn’t show my teeth. A bio that tried to sound funny without begging.

I swiped for weeks.

Nothing.



Then one night, while brushing my teeth and half-watching myself age in the mirror, my phone buzzed.

MATCHED.

Her name was Elena.

Not glamorous. Not influencer-perfect. Just… real. Soft eyes. A crooked smile. One photo showed her holding a chipped mug in what looked like a messy kitchen. Another had her laughing mid-motion, blurred and human. No filters. No hashtags.

She messaged first.

You look like someone who hates small talk. Good. I do too.

I laughed out loud.

We talked for hours. About music neither of us admitted to liking. About jobs that drained us quietly instead of loudly. About how loneliness felt heavier when shared spaces stayed empty too long.

She didn’t flirt aggressively. She didn’t overshare. She listened.

That alone felt intoxicating.



After a week, she suggested we meet.

Not a bar. Not a restaurant.

“My place,” she said. “I cook better than most places around here anyway.”

I hesitated. I knew the rules. Meet in public. Tell someone where you’re going. Trust your gut.

My gut said yes.

I told myself that was bravery, not desperation.

Her address was only fifteen minutes away, in a neighborhood that looked normal enough. Streetlights. Parked cars. A porch light glowing warm against the dark.

She answered the door barefoot, wearing an oversized sweater and a tired smile.

“You’re taller than I expected,” she said.

“So are you,” I replied, immediately regretting how stupid that sounded.

She laughed anyway and stepped aside to let me in.

The house smelled like garlic and something sweet—caramelized onions, maybe. Soft music played somewhere deeper inside. It felt lived-in. Comfortable.

Safe.



We talked while she cooked. She moved easily around the kitchen, occasionally brushing past me, close enough that I felt warmth but not threat. She poured wine. Asked questions. Listened to answers.

At some point, I realized I hadn’t checked my phone once.

Dinner was incredible. I told her so, and she looked genuinely pleased, not coy.

“People don’t compliment food enough,” she said. “They just eat and forget.”

Afterward, she suggested dessert.

“Just give me a minute,” she said, heading down a narrow hallway. “Bathroom’s on the left if you need it.”

I waited. Sipped wine. Looked around.

That’s when I noticed the photos.

Not family. Not friends.

Men.

All different ages. Different styles. Some smiling, some serious. Each framed neatly, lining the hallway wall like a timeline.

I stood up, curiosity prickling.

They weren’t posed photos. They looked… candid. Cropped from other images. A man mid-laugh at a bar. Another squinting into sunlight. One holding a coffee cup identical to the one Elena used earlier.

I reached the end of the hall just as she called out, “Almost ready!”

Something about the word almost made my chest tighten.



I turned back toward the living room.

The floor shifted under me.

Just a little. Enough to throw off my balance.

Pain exploded behind my eyes.



When I woke, my mouth tasted like copper and panic.

I was lying on my back, wrists and ankles bound—not tightly, but thoroughly. Leather straps. Buckles. Careful knots.

Above me, a ceiling fan spun lazily, clicking once per rotation.

Elena stood beside me, calm as ever, holding my phone.

“You left it unlocked,” she said gently. “You should be more careful.”

I tried to speak. My throat burned. My tongue felt thick.

She noticed and brought a glass of water to my lips, tilting it just enough to let me swallow.

“There,” she said. “I don’t want you uncomfortable.”

I tested the restraints. They didn’t budge.

“Why?” I croaked.

She sat on a stool, folding her hands in her lap.

“Because you came,” she said simply.

“That’s not—”

“It is,” she interrupted. “You read my messages. You saw my photos. You chose to be here.”

Fear crawled up my spine, cold and intimate.

“I won’t hurt you,” she continued. “Not unless you make it necessary.”

I laughed, a broken sound. “You already did.”

She tilted her head, considering.

“Pain is relative.”



She stood and walked toward the hallway.

“Let me show you something.”

She returned with a small box. Inside were phones. At least a dozen. All different models. All powered off.

“I keep them,” she said. “People panic when they lose things. I like order.”

My phone joined them.

“What do you want?” I asked.

She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes.

“I want honesty.”

She pulled a chair closer and sat facing me.

“Tell me why you swiped right.”

I blinked. “Because I liked you?”

“That’s the answer everyone gives,” she said. “Try again.”

Silence stretched.

“Because I was lonely,” I admitted.

Her shoulders relaxed.

“There it is.”

She nodded slowly, as if I’d solved a puzzle.

“Loneliness makes people honest,” she said. “It makes them brave. Reckless. It brings them to doors they wouldn’t normally knock on.”



She stood again and paced.

“I used to swipe too,” she said. “I used to believe the profiles. The promises. I believed effort meant intention.”

She stopped in front of the photo-lined hallway.

“They always left,” she continued. “Or stayed long enough to take something and disappear.”

She turned back to me.

“So I stopped letting them leave.”

My heart hammered.

“What happens now?” I asked.

She considered the question carefully.

“Now,” she said, “we see how honest you really are.”



She asked me things.

Not passwords. Not secrets.

Things that hurt.

When was the last time someone touched you without wanting something?

What do you hate about yourself?

Have you ever imagined disappearing?

Hours passed. Or minutes. Time warped around her questions.

Each answer felt like pulling a wire out of my chest.

She listened. She nodded. She never mocked.

When I cried, she waited.



Finally, she stood.

“You’re different,” she said.

Hope flared before I could stop it.

“You feel real,” she continued. “That’s rare.”

She reached for the buckles.

My breath caught.

“I don’t keep the real ones,” she said softly.

She loosened my wrist.

Relief flooded me so fast I nearly sobbed.

Then she tightened it again.

“But I also don’t let them leave.”

I stared at her, understanding too late.

She leaned down, close enough that I could smell the wine on her breath.

“You don’t need to go back,” she whispered. “You don’t need to swipe anymore. You don’t need to be alone.”

She pressed her forehead to mine.

“I chose you.”



The ceiling fan clicked.

Once.

Twice.

Somewhere in the house, my phone buzzed—another notification from the app.

Another match.

She smiled.

“Dinner tomorrow,” she said. “We’ll need more chairs.”

The fan kept spinning.

And I realized the straps weren’t restraints.

They were invitations.

Ive very recently developed feelings for her. We do get along quite well and she does feel comfortable with me at least, she punches me when I tease her, she lets me take a sip of her coffee, and she has said that she would quit if me and my coworker friend were to leave. She doesn't seem to be that romantically interested (just from trying to read her) and she does think Im kinda immature (though she kinda is as well.) 

I was wondering if I should just take her out on lunch at work just to get to really know her for a bit and vise versa, maybe she will see me as less mature, or should I just go all out and ask her out outside of work hours. I feel like I should ask her sooner rather than later than later because I might lose my chance, and I know she strictly wants the guy to make the first move, so I feel like she would at least be down to try.

1qo70jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crush/comments/1qo70jj/full_storyneed_outside_opinions/,Full story-need outside opinions,"I need some neutral opinions because I feel stuck in my own head.

This girl and I are classmates at university and we’re both studying physiotherapy. We get along very easily and have good chemistry in conversation. I’m generally a friendly person and I tend to click with people naturally, so at first I didn’t think much of it. From the outside, it honestly looks like she probably just sees me as a colleague/friend and doesn’t want anything romantic with me.

Last Thursday we met for coffee. After that, she texted me and suggested that I come over to her place so we could work on our theses and help each other. She said it was fine because her boyfriend was currently in Lithuania. During texting, she also complained about him a bit: that he doesn’t compliment her, that I compliment her more than he does, and she used a tired/annoyed emoji.

I offered to come in the morning, but she suggested the afternoon instead, saying it would be calmer and we’d have peace. She made it sound like we’d be alone (later I found out her younger brother was home but stayed in his room). She even apologized in messages for the situation and ended with something like “we’ll still see each other again anyway, right?”

When I came over, she was very welcoming: made cappuccino, brought fruit and homemade pastries, showed me her room, very warm and personal atmosphere. We worked on our theses and talked a lot. At one point I asked if her boyfriend knew I was there. She said yes, casually.

She then mentioned wanting to take a massage course and said I already had one, so she asked me to check her back for muscle knots. As physiotherapists, this didn’t feel completely out of context, but it was still quite intimate. She lay down and I gave her a short massage. During that, the conversation again shifted to her boyfriend: how long he’s away, how he doesn’t compliment her, how she told him she needs that and he brushed it off. I told her she deserves someone who appreciates her more, and she agreed, saying women are more sentimental and need that kind of attention.

She also said something like “you’ve helped me so much, I’ll probably have to cook you lunch or dinner sometime.” At one point I helped fasten her bra, she laughed and didn’t set any boundary. When I was leaving, she asked if I needed navigation home. I jokingly said “what if I stayed over?” She laughed and said her boyfriend would kill her if that happened — not that she didn’t want it, but that it would be a problem because of him.

After that, she kept asking about my schedule and comparing it with hers, like checking when we could see each other again. We loosely agreed to go running together on Sunday. She also compared me to her boyfriend again: how I take care of my health, how he eats badly, doesn’t exercise anymore, and how they’ve argued about it before.

At the same time, looking at this rationally, it really seems like she doesn’t actually want anything romantic with me and sees me as a friend/colleague she feels safe with. That’s part of what makes this confusing.

I haven’t sent her any message yet, but the situation started messing with my head. I like her too much to be “just friends”, and staying close while she has a boyfriend feels unhealthy for me. Being nice and staying involved makes it worse for me, but ghosting or being rude also feels wrong.

So my dilemma is:

	•	Does this look like emotional boundary crossing from her side, or am I overthinking normal friendly behavior?

	•	Is it reasonable to step back even if she probably means well and just sees me as a friend?

	•	Is there a respectful way to handle this without hurting her or myself?

	•	Or is this simply a situation where no one is really at fault, but distance is still the right move?

I’d really appreciate honest opinions.",1,1769498133.0,Crush,0,1.0,False

**$DKNG**: **+122**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.22U

League: Sacramento Kings vs New Yorks Knicks (6:30PM CST on NBA League Pass)

**Recap**: Even wit mins restriction Jrue Holiday comes thru! Almost went like I predicted lol. Jrue hit 2+ Threes in the 1st half and hits his 3rd Three in the 2nd half. He played exactly like how I anticipated! 21 to 25 mins and I knew he was going to take his threes, we just needed 3+ Threes and we got it! A nice **+180✅** BANGER. Btw my best bet yesterday was **EDM TT O  4.5 Goals (+110)**✅ 

**Matchup:** Maybe I found a lil' niche in the NBA market? I think I am 5-0 in NBA three pointers prop! I like this prop a lot, it's not lucrative as much as I like but it's still plus money! Zach LaVine 3+ Threes (+122) against the Knicks. I actually wagered this recently on LaVine against the Knicks on January 14th (**5 for 9 in three pointers**), but that was in their house. This time they will be playing MSG and I still like it it because of the matchup! I liked it and wagered it before the 1/14 matchup because of the matchup and I am liking/wagering it again because of the matchup (was that redundant?). Let's dive into the previous matchups and historical trends.

**Knicks give up the 3rd most Threes this season, they really don't guard hard beyond the arc, which gives shooters space to shoot their shots**. LaVine doesn't need much space, but you can't give any shooter space or open looks because they usually knock it down, especially LaVine. He is a prolific shooter, Zach is going to shoot threes no matter the matchup. **The Knicks also gives up just above this line to SG (3.39 3PM per game), they also just allowed 3+ Threes to their last 3 opponents SG, Maxey, MPJ (not a shooting guard, but it's the Nets) and 8 Three Pointers to Max Christie!** Getting 3+ Threes for plus money is a steal IMO (I would go 2U on this but since I recently had a freefall, I'm going to slow build).

[In his last 8 games he's hit 3+ Threes in 6 of those games, but this is favorable matchup for LaVine](https://preview.redd.it/omh4u0kh9ufg1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=36e05f364a31bdb9670513bab2b1eae8e1147e48)

**LaVine has also gone over this line 6 of his last 8 games and he's gone over this line 5 of his last 6 matchups vs the Knicks. And he's hit 3+ Threes in his last two appearance in MSG and 5 of his last 7 games at MSG.** He might have not hit 3+ Threes in his last two games, but this is a really favorable matchup, so I will take my chances on plus money wit this line.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on Zach LaVine 3+ Threes (+122) on $DKNG. Sprinkling half unit on 4+ Threes as well. Zach LaVine hits all his Threes in the 1st half.

He's been sitting on this enterprise SaaS idea in the HRTech space for months. Good idea too - validated with potential customers. But he can't code much.

So he started getting quotes.

The developer route?

\> Senior devs wanted $120K-150K a year plus equity. Even juniors were $80K+. But it's not just the salary - it's the commitment. What if it doesn't work? He was worried about bleeding cash every month on payroll while trying to figure out if anyone will pay for his product.

Dev agencies?

\> Cheapest quote: $23,000. Most expensive: $47K. Timeline? 3-4 months. And any changes after delivery? Extra. Always extra.

Then he found this AI coding thing.

He took a $500 course on Agentic spec coding - basically using specialized AI agents to build software without being a developer.

A month later, he had a working MVP. Not a prototype. An actual product he's testing with real users.

The math:

* Devs: $120K+ per year
* Agency: $23K, months of waiting
* His way: $500, one month

What surprised him most: The speed, flexibility, and scalability. With an agency, every change takes days or weeks of negotiation. Now he iterates in hours. Idea in the morning, tested and fixed by dinner.

This isn't magic. Rohan had frustrating nights because of the lack of experience with spec coding. Things broke. You still need to understand what you're building - the AI doesn't think for you.

Three years ago, non-technical founders had to learn to code for years or raise money. Now there's another path. Not replacing developers for complex stuff, but for getting an MVP out there? Absolutely game changing.

What would you build if you didn't need to raise millions of $ in funding first?",5,1769497364.0,IndianEntrepreneur,10,0.73,False

Initially I was seeking for more in life than one partner. My wife and I then found out together that we are probably either poly or ENM.

We understand each other very well and venture out together. So far so good and luckily neither one of us ""must"" go on dating apps.

With this post, I guess I am seeking advice for finding a relationship within ENM/FwB or within polyamory.

I tried Tinder with the result of nowadays either scam attempts or women in their 40's looking for the one and only to have kids with -> D'uh, you are at least 10 years too late. Similar on bumble. Less scams, though.

Then there are traditionalists who do not want ENM. Fair enough, I do not judge here. But if my profile says clearly that I have a life partner and I am not looking for another life partner,then maybe do not match me...

And then there are men, whose behaviour I get to know from dates or discussions with my wife. Cheating on their wives, lying to get women into their bed (often successfully, it seems), looking for themselves exclusively. It is like staring into a cesspool.

And after some months of experience this tragedy is apparent: the human condition.

Women often look first! for someone reliable for something stable and decide then where to go with it. But they only get fuckdates.

Men look for sex in the first place, but the market mostly offers women looking for something reliable and stable. They would then decide how to go on.

And there is a lot of grievances due to this.

Back in the analogue days (I am 41, btw.), you would meet someone, see if there is a connection and then decide how to proceed. Coffee together? Fine!

Taking them home after the disco? Fine!

This does not seem to work any more. Either the other one seems! to match perfectly or they are discarded.

It is heartless, helpless and shows no character.

So after half a year of dating, this rather wears me down and any advice that you can give after reading the above is welcome.

Disclaimer: The obvious factors do not seem to be the problem in this equation. I have all my hair, am fit and hold a phD. I am quite outgoing, reasonably successfull with women offline. My photofeeler scores are around 7.5 and some are higher. I have a high paying job, dress well, can entertain a conversation, speak 4+ languages, travel a lot, play an instrument in a band and can dance on a high level and geek out in a club...

I think if I did lie about my status and did pretend to look for a partner for life, it would be much easier. But this way is out of the question!",1,1769497194.0,dating_advice,1,0.99,False

Introduction to Kodava Literature

Kodava literature represents a vibrant yet understated facet of India's diverse linguistic and cultural tapestry. Emerging from the misty hills of Kodagu, a district in southern Karnataka known for its lush coffee plantations, warrior traditions, and deep-rooted connection to nature, this body of work encapsulates the essence of the Kodava people. The Kodavas, also referred to as Coorgs, are an ethno-linguistic community with a distinct identity shaped by their Dravidian language, Kodava Thakk, and a history interwoven with martial prowess, agrarian lifestyles, and spiritual reverence for ancestors and deities like Goddess Kaveri.

Historically, Kodava literature was predominantly oral, transmitted through generations via folk songs, proverbs, riddles, and epic narratives recited during festivals, weddings, funerals, and communal gatherings. These oral traditions, rich in metaphor and rhythm, served as repositories of cultural knowledge, moral lessons, and historical events. Songs such as the Balo Patt or Dudi Patt, performed with traditional drums, captured the joys of harvest, the valor of warriors, and the sorrows of loss. Proverbs, often pithy and laced with humor, offered wisdom on daily life, while riddles sharpened the intellect of the young. This oral heritage, however, faced threats from external influences, including the dominance of Kannada and English during colonial times, prompting a shift toward written forms in the early 20th century.

The transition from oral to written literature marked a pivotal moment, driven by a desire to preserve the Kodava identity amid modernization and cultural assimilation. Pioneers played a crucial role in this evolution, adapting the Kannada script to Kodava Thakk and creating foundational texts that blended folklore with literary innovation. Their efforts not only documented vanishing customs but also elevated Kodava Thakk to a medium capable of expressing complex emotions, philosophies, and narratives. This literature often explores themes of nature's bounty, familial bonds, spiritual devotion, and the Kodavas' storied past as soldiers and landowners. As Kodagu integrated into broader Indian society post-independence, these works became vital for maintaining cultural continuity, especially as the language faces endangerment today.

The pioneers' contributions laid the groundwork for subsequent generations, inspiring dictionaries, histories, poems, and even novels. Their writings reflect a blend of indigenous elements with influences from Sanskrit epics, Kannada literature, and English scholarship. By delving into the lives and works of these key figures, we uncover how Kodava literature evolved from humble beginnings into a symbol of resilience and pride.

The Dawn of Written Kodava Literature

The inception of written Kodava literature can be traced to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a period when colonial administration and educational reforms began influencing the region. Prior to this, Kodava Thakk lacked a standardized script, relying on modified Kannada characters for occasional records like family genealogies inscribed on palm leaves, known as Pattole. These early inscriptions, often in a mix of languages, documented rituals, land deeds, and clan histories but did not constitute a formal literary canon.

The catalyst for change came from enlightened individuals who recognized the peril of cultural erosion. British officials and local educators encouraged writing in native tongues, fostering a sense of linguistic pride. This era saw the first attempts to transcribe oral folklore, blending traditional storytelling with structured literary forms. Pioneers emerged from diverse backgrounds—teachers, officials, soldiers, and scholars—who balanced professional duties with a passion for preservation. Their works addressed the limitations of Kodava vocabulary by borrowing from Sanskrit and Kannada, enriching the language while maintaining its unique phonetic and idiomatic charm.

This dawn was not without challenges: limited publishing resources, societal indifference, and the predominance of Kannada as the regional lingua franca hindered progress. Yet, through perseverance, these early writers produced texts that served as cultural anchors, influencing education, theater, and community identity. The period set the stage for a literary renaissance, where folklore met formalism, and oral vibrancy found permanence in print.

Appaneravanda Haridasa Appachcha Kavi: The Moolapurusha of Kodava Literature

Appaneravanda Haridasa Appachcha Kavi, fondly known as Appacha Kavi, stands as the undisputed father of written Kodava literature. Born around 1869 in Kodagu, his life exemplified dedication amid adversity, earning him titles like ""Sahitya Brahma"" and ""Rasika Raja."" His pioneering efforts transformed Kodava Thakk from an oral dialect into a literary language capable of conveying profound narratives and emotions.

Early Life and Influences of Appacha Kavi

Appacha Kavi's formative years were steeped in the cultural milieu of Madikeri, where he encountered theater through the Tiptur Nataka Company. Performing near the Omkareshwara temple in the 1870s and 1880s, these troupes introduced him to classical music and drama. He memorized songs, took minor roles, and trained under maestros like Sri Venkatadri Shyamaraya, mastering raagas such as Kalyani and Hindustani. This exposure ignited his artistic inclinations.

Educationally, he served as a teacher, but a turning point came in 1894 when district education officer Raghunatha Rai urged him to write in his mother tongue to glorify the Kodava people. Married in 1892 and transferred to Bhagamandala, Appacha Kavi balanced family and career while nurturing his literary pursuits. He drew inspiration from Sanskrit puranas, Kannada literature, and Kodava oral traditions like Baalopat and Makkala paat, which he sought to elevate through written expression.

Despite facing poverty, loss of patrons like Maletira Machayya and Kelappanda Muddappa, and personal tragedies—including his house burning in 1926—Appacha Kavi persisted. Letters to contemporaries reveal his struggles: unfulfilled publishing promises and descent into deafness. Yet, these hardships fueled his creativity, making him a symbol of resilience.

Major Works and Plays by Appacha Kavi

Appacha Kavi's oeuvre includes plays, poems, and devotional songs, showcasing mastery over the Navarasas—emotions like humor, pathos, and heroism. His first major play, ""Yayati Nataka"" (1906), drew from mythological tales, incorporating raagas like Kaapi and Ketaara. ""Savitri Nataka"" and ""Subramanya Nataka"" (1908) followed, blending devotion with drama. ""Kaveri Nataka"" (1918), a tribute to the sacred river, highlighted Kodava reverence for nature, using raagas such as Mohan and Khamaaj.

He also authored ""Sukanya Parinaya"" (1909) in Kannada, though unpublished, and composed Harikathas in later years. His poetry, often impromptu, captured everyday beauty: verses praising Goddess Parvati (""Shanmukhandavvaa Nee, Manmatha Maavi Ni"") or describing white toddy (""Kall nalladh kanda /kallanga kellaakku""). These works simplified complex themes for common audiences, with instructions on singing to familiar tunes.

Appacha Kavi performed his plays himself, switching to Kannada for wider appeal, earning acclaim in publications like the Madras Mail. His unprinted collection ""Bhakta Ratnakara"" represents a lost treasure, yet surviving excerpts demonstrate his linguistic innovation.

Contributions and Legacy of Appacha Kavi

As the moolapurusha, Appacha Kavi proved Kodava Thakk's literary potential, enriching its vocabulary with Sanskrit borrowings and proving it could express all rasas. He inspired hundreds of subsequent books and poets, with his works revered as sacred in Kodava homes. Contemporaries like Sri Panje Mangesha Rai praised his talents in 1928.

His legacy endures through cultural festivals commemorating his 125th birth anniversary in 1994 and scholarly analyses. By bridging oral and written forms, Appacha Kavi ensured Kodava literature's survival, influencing modern expressions in theater and music.

Nadikerianda Chinnappa: The Compiler of Folk Traditions

Nadikerianda Chinnappa, a multifaceted figure born in 1875, bridged Kodava's oral past with its written future. As a compiler, poet, and public servant, he preserved vanishing traditions, making him a cornerstone of Kodava literature.

Early Life and Diverse Career of Nadikerianda Chinnappa

Born in Karada village to Kodava parents, Chinnappa was the fifth-eldest of eight siblings. His clan traced roots to legendary figures like Nadikerianda Devayya. Excelling in studies at Mercara's Central High School and Mangalore, he shone in sports like cricket and hockey.

Marrying his brother's widow per tradition, Chinnappa taught briefly before joining the revenue department in 1899. His poem ""My Position as Shanbog"" reflected job frustrations. He served in the Coorg Regiment (1902-1904), rising to Subedar-Major, then the police, becoming Prosecuting Inspector. Horseback patrols across Kodagu allowed him to collect folklore from rural singers.

Key Works like Pattole Palame by Nadikerianda Chinnappa

Chinnappa's magnum opus, ""Pattole Palame"" (1924), compiles folksongs, traditions, and 750 proverbs. ""Pattole"" evokes palm-leaf records, ""Palame"" oral lore. Two-thirds are Balo Pat songs for ceremonies, funded by British officials and praised by reviewers.

He translated the Bhagavad Gita into Kodava as ""Bhagvathanda Patt"" (1929), styled as accessible Balopattu. His patriotic ""Sri Moola Kanniye"" (1917), a hymn to Goddess Kaveri, served as a subtle self-rule anthem. For the Linguistic Survey of India (1922), he recorded parables and songs, archived in global libraries.

Other poems include Kannada's ""Somagirija Deva"" and English verses, showcasing linguistic versatility.

Significance and Philanthropy of Nadikerianda Chinnappa

Chinnappa pioneered Kodava writing alongside Appacha Kavi, using Kannada script. ""Pattole Palame"" remains the definitive text on Kodava customs, referenced for rituals. His English translation, completed posthumously in 2003, broadened access.

A philanthropist, he founded banks and education funds, sponsoring orphans. Dying in 1931 from cancer, his 119th anniversary was celebrated in 1994. Chinnappa's work ensures oral traditions' immortality, influencing anthropology and cultural studies.

Walking into the living room section of the showroom, it becomes immediately clear why the sofa is often called the heart of the home. Every arrangement seems to radiate outward from it. Sofas here aren’t styled as isolated furniture pieces; they anchor entire living environments. As an interior design enthusiast observes the layouts, it’s easy to imagine daily life unfolding around them—morning coffee, quiet afternoons, long conversations, and shared evenings.

What’s striking is the variety. From structured, contemporary Sofas to more relaxed [Indian sittings](https://soulwoodventures.com/indian-sitting/), each seating style feels purposeful. Some arrangements are paired with understated Center Tables, others balanced with accent Chairs or slim Consoles, subtly shaping how the space is used. Nearby TV Units are integrated quietly into the layout, never overpowering the seating but complementing it.

The craftsmanship stands out through proportion and detail rather than ornamentation. Solid frames, comfortable depths, and thoughtful upholstery choices suggest furniture designed for everyday living, not just visual appeal. Observing these setups reinforces an important idea: the right sofa doesn’t just fill a room—it defines how the room feels.

In modern homes, where living spaces often serve multiple purposes, the sofa becomes a constant. It’s where rest, interaction, and routine intersect, making its role far more significant than its size alone suggests.

# Understanding Your Living Habits Before Choosing a Sofa

Moving through different living room settings, one insight becomes unavoidable—no two sofa arrangements feel the same, because no two lifestyles are the same. The showroom layouts quietly emphasize that choosing Sofas begins not with design preferences, but with daily habits. This perspective feels refreshingly honest.

Some seating clusters feel perfect for families who gather often, with generous Sofas paired with supportive Chairs. Others are clearly designed for quieter routines, where Indian Sittings and compact arrangements encourage slower living. Writing Tables placed nearby hint at reading, journaling, or informal work sessions, suggesting that living rooms today are rarely used for just one purpose.

The observer notices how spacing changes from one layout to another. In some settings, Center Tables sit close, ideal for everyday use. In others, the openness allows free movement, hinting at homes where flexibility matters. Nearby [dining sets](https://soulwoodventures.com/dining/) and Modular Kitchens visible in open layouts further reinforce how interconnected modern living spaces have become.

What this walkthrough reveals is that a sofa must respond to how people actually live—how often they host, how they relax, how they transition between work and rest. Furniture here doesn’t dictate behavior; it adapts to it. That adaptability is what makes a sofa truly transformative in everyday living.

# Sofa Types Explained: Finding What Truly Fits Your Space

As the showroom unfolds, the diversity of sofa styles becomes increasingly apparent. Each type feels thoughtfully placed, helping visitors visualize how different formats work within real homes. There’s no single “ideal” sofa here—only what suits the space and lifestyle.

Compact Sofas appear in apartment-style layouts, paired with slim Center Tables and light Chairs to maintain openness. Larger seating formats dominate more expansive living areas, where Indian Sittings and accent seating create layered comfort zones. These arrangements demonstrate how scale and proportion matter just as much as aesthetics.

What’s particularly engaging is how sofa types are shown alongside complementary furniture. [TV units](https://soulwoodventures.com/tv-units/) are sized according to seating distance, Consoles subtly frame walkways, and Other Accessories add warmth without clutter. The result feels balanced, not staged.

Observing these variations highlights how choosing the right sofa is as much about the room as it is about the piece itself. Ceiling height, circulation paths, and nearby furniture all influence what works best. This approach demystifies sofa selection, shifting it from guesswork to thoughtful planning.

In 2026 homes, where flexibility and functionality matter more than rigid layouts, understanding sofa types becomes essential. The showroom quietly teaches that the right fit isn’t about trends—it’s about harmony.

# Comfort Beyond Cushions: What Really Makes a Sofa Comfortable

Sitting briefly on different [sofas](https://soulwoodventures.com/sofas/) reveals a truth often overlooked—comfort isn’t defined by softness alone. The observer notices how some seats support the back better, how armrests fall naturally, and how seat depth changes the experience entirely. Comfort here feels intentional, not accidental.

The structure beneath the upholstery plays a major role. Solid frames provide stability, while carefully considered cushioning balances support with relaxation. These details may not be immediately visible, but they become apparent through use. Chairs placed alongside sofas echo this same philosophy, offering comfort without compromising posture.

Nearby Office Chairs and Writing [tables](https://soulwoodventures.com/tables/) serve as an interesting contrast. While designed for productivity, they share the same attention to ergonomics. This consistency across furniture categories reflects a deeper understanding of how bodies interact with furniture throughout the day.

What stands out is how these sofas feel designed for long conversations, not quick impressions. They encourage sitting longer, resting deeper. In everyday living, this kind of comfort quietly improves quality of life.

The showroom experience reinforces that a comfortable sofa isn’t about indulgence—it’s about thoughtful design, craftsmanship, and understanding how people truly relax at home.

# Materials Matter: Wood, Upholstery, and Everyday Durability

Moving closer, materials take center stage. The sofas reveal solid wood frames beneath refined upholstery, subtly communicating durability without being overt. The craftsmanship is evident in joinery, finishes, and how different materials come together seamlessly.

Fabric choices vary—from textured weaves to smoother finishes—each suggesting different lifestyles and maintenance needs. These decisions feel grounded in practicality. Nearby [beds](https://soulwoodventures.com/beds/), Wardrobes, and [dining chairs](https://soulwoodventures.com/dining-chairs/) share the same material language, creating continuity across rooms.

The observer notices how wood tones repeat across furniture categories—Sofas, Center Tables, [consoles](https://soulwoodventures.com/consoles/), and even TV Units—giving the home a cohesive visual rhythm. This consistency reinforces the idea that furniture should age together, not feel replaced piece by piece.

Durability here isn’t marketed; it’s implied through construction and detail. Upholstery feels resilient, frames feel reassuringly sturdy. These are pieces meant to be lived with, not tiptoed around.

In everyday living, materials quietly influence comfort, maintenance, and longevity. Observing these sofas in context highlights how thoughtful material choices can transform not just how furniture looks, but how it supports life over time.

# Designing Around the Sofa: Layout, Balance, and Flow

The final living room layouts reveal how a sofa shapes everything around it. Placement feels deliberate—never blocking movement, always encouraging flow. Sofas are positioned to invite conversation, framed by Chairs or balanced with Consoles that subtly guide circulation.

[Center tables](https://soulwoodventures.com/center-table/) anchor the seating, while TV Units are placed at comfortable viewing distances, reinforcing ergonomic planning. In some layouts, Dining Sets and Modular Kitchens are visible beyond the living area, showing how open-plan homes rely on furniture to define zones rather than walls.

The observer notes how negative space is respected. Not every corner is filled. This restraint allows the sofa to breathe within the room, enhancing both comfort and aesthetics. Other Accessories—lamps, rugs, textures—are used sparingly, supporting rather than distracting.

This approach highlights an essential truth: the right sofa doesn’t just transform seating—it transforms the entire room’s balance. Layout decisions become easier when the sofa is chosen thoughtfully.

In 2026 homes, where flexibility and openness define living spaces, designing around the sofa becomes an exercise in harmony. The showroom demonstrates this quietly, through lived-in, believable settings.

# Indian Living, Modern Homes: Blending Tradition with Today

One of the most engaging aspects of the showroom is how naturally it blends tradition with contemporary living. Indian Sittings appear alongside modern Sofas, not as contrasting styles but as complementary expressions of comfort. Low seating arrangements are placed thoughtfully—near windows, beside bookshelves, or anchored by Center Tables—suggesting spaces meant for conversation, reflection, or informal gatherings.

What’s refreshing is how these traditional elements are reinterpreted for modern homes. Clean lines, solid wood craftsmanship, and neutral finishes allow Indian Sittings to feel relevant in today’s apartments and villas. They coexist comfortably with [chairs](https://soulwoodventures.com/chairs/), Consoles, and even nearby TV Units, proving that tradition doesn’t need to be isolated to a single corner.

This integration reflects how Indian households function across generations. Furniture here supports flexibility—spaces where elders prefer grounded seating while younger family members gravitate toward Sofas or accent Chairs. The result is harmony rather than compromise.

Dining and living areas flow into one another, often leading toward Modular Kitchens or Dining Sets, reinforcing how cultural habits influence layout. Observing these arrangements makes it clear that good design respects heritage without being bound by it. In 2026, the most successful homes are those that feel rooted yet adaptable—spaces where tradition evolves naturally alongside modern life.

# Small Spaces, Big Impact: Choosing Sofas for Apartments

Apartment-sized layouts reveal how impactful the right sofa choice can be. Compact Sofas are paired with slim Center Tables and lightweight Chairs, creating seating areas that feel open rather than crowded. The observer notices how proportions are carefully considered—nothing overwhelms the room, yet comfort is never sacrificed.

In these setups, multifunctionality becomes key. Consoles double as storage and display, while Writing Tables are tucked neatly into corners, suggesting work-from-home routines without dedicated rooms. Nearby [wardrobes](https://soulwoodventures.com/wooden-framing-wardrobes/) and Beds visible in adjoining displays reinforce the idea that [furniture](https://soulwoodventures.com/products/) must work harder in smaller homes.

Visual tricks are used subtly. Sofas with visible legs create a sense of openness, while lighter upholstery tones reflect natural light. TV Units are streamlined, often wall-mounted or low-profile, preventing visual clutter. Other Accessories are minimal, allowing each piece to serve a clear purpose.

What stands out is how these apartment-friendly arrangements don’t feel like compromises. Instead, they feel intentional and well-resolved. The showroom demonstrates that with the right sofa and thoughtful pairing, even compact spaces can feel generous. In everyday living, this thoughtful planning transforms not just rooms—but the experience of home itself.

# Styling Your Sofa Without Overdoing It

Styling, when done well, feels almost invisible—and the living room displays here embody that philosophy. Sofas are styled with restraint. A few cushions, a throw, perhaps a nearby Chair or Center Table—nothing excessive, nothing forced. The focus remains on comfort and usability.

The observer notices how textures are layered rather than colors. Neutral upholstery is complemented by wood tones from Consoles and Tables, while soft furnishings add warmth without clutter. Lighting plays a quiet role too, with lamps placed to support reading or conversation rather than drama.

[Other accessories](https://soulwoodventures.com/other-accesories/)—vases, books, trays—appear sparingly, suggesting personal touches rather than staged perfection. This approach reinforces a key idea: styling should support living, not interfere with it. A sofa should invite use, not demand careful maintenance.

Even in dining and work-adjacent spaces, this restraint continues. Dining Chairs are styled simply, Writing Tables kept functional, Office Chairs chosen for comfort rather than flash. The overall effect is calm and approachable.

In 2026 homes, styling feels less about display and more about atmosphere. Observing these sofa settings highlights how thoughtful editing can transform a space—allowing furniture to shine while life takes center stage.

# Longevity Over Trends: Why Quality Sofas Are Worth It

As the walkthrough nears its end, the emphasis on longevity becomes unmistakable. Sofas here feel designed to last—not just structurally, but aesthetically. Their forms are timeless, avoiding exaggerated trends that date quickly. This sense of permanence extends across furniture categories, from Beds and Wardrobes to Dining Sets and [office furniture](https://soulwoodventures.com/office-furniture/).

Craftsmanship reveals itself in quiet ways: solid frames, careful joinery, balanced proportions. Upholstery feels chosen for durability as much as comfort. These are pieces meant to be lived with, reupholstered if needed, and passed through years of use rather than replaced on impulse.

The observer reflects on how this approach aligns with changing values. In 2026, homeowners are increasingly conscious of sustainability—not just environmentally, but emotionally. Furniture that lasts reduces waste and builds familiarity. A well-loved sofa carries memories, not just wear.

Nearby [sun loungers](https://soulwoodventures.com/sun-loungers/), [indoor swings](https://soulwoodventures.com/indoor-swings/), and Dining Chairs echo this philosophy, reinforcing that quality should extend throughout the home. Investing in good furniture becomes less about status and more about stability.

This perspective reframes the sofa as a long-term companion—one that quietly supports everyday life, year after year.

# Observing Craftsmanship: What Showrooms Reveal About Good Sofas

Seeing furniture in real settings changes how it’s understood. The showroom experience reveals nuances that catalog images never capture—how a sofa feels at different times of day, how it interacts with light, how it relates to nearby furniture. This immersive observation becomes invaluable.

Sofas are shown in context, paired thoughtfully with Center Tables, Chairs, and TV Units, making proportions easier to judge. Walking past Dining Sets and [modular kitchens](https://soulwoodventures.com/modular-kitchen/) nearby reinforces how sofas fit into larger home ecosystems rather than existing in isolation.

The observer notices details up close: stitching, wood grain, finishing. These elements speak of craftsmanship without words. Even Office Chairs and Writing Tables reflect the same attention to ergonomics and build quality, creating a cohesive narrative across categories.

What becomes clear is that good sofas reveal themselves over time and touch. Sitting, walking around, observing flow—these experiences inform better decisions. The showroom doesn’t instruct; it allows discovery.

In an age of online shopping, this tactile experience feels grounding. It reminds visitors that furniture is meant to be experienced, not just viewed.

# Conclusion: One Sofa, Many Everyday Moments

Leaving the showroom, the impression that lingers isn’t of a single sofa, but of how thoughtfully chosen furniture shapes everyday living. From Sofas and Indian Sittings to Writing Tables, Wardrobes, and Indoor Swings, each piece plays a quiet role in supporting daily routines.

The right sofa transforms more than a room—it influences how people gather, rest, work, and unwind. When paired with well-considered Chairs, Center Tables, TV Units, and Other Accessories, it becomes part of a larger story—one of comfort, balance, and intention.

In 2026, homes are increasingly designed around how life actually unfolds. Furniture choices reflect this shift, favoring longevity, craftsmanship, and adaptability over fleeting trends. Observing these spaces reinforces that good design doesn’t shout—it supports.

Following along offers a closer look at furniture in real settings, craftsmanship details, and evolving home ideas—quiet inspiration for everyday living.

It didn’t wake me up and I only remembered I had the dream while I was having my coffee.

I’m trying to choose between two budget grinders and would love to hear from people who have actually used them.

The two models are:

* **Viesimple Gen 4 (\~$180)**
* **AMZCHEF Single Dose Coffee Grinder (\~$130)**

This would be paired with a **Gevi espresso machine**, so my main focus is **espresso performance**, though I occasionally brew other methods too. Specs look decent for the price, but real-world use matters more.

If you’ve owned or used one of these:

* How’s the grind consistency for espresso?
* Any problems with retention, clumping, or static?
* Build quality — solid or plasticky?
* How has it held up over time?

And if you think **there’s a clearly better grinder in this price range**, I’m open to recommendations as well.

Thanks — firsthand experience helps much more than marketing info.",1,1769496335.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1qo6f8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qo6f8r/tales_from_the_night_shift_log_2/,Tales From the Night Shift: Log 2,"The first time I met The Day Shift Manager, was a day I couldn’t forget even if I wanted to.

It was close to sunset, that odd humidity that came along with the summer season was ever present, but was something I never minded. Though I couldn’t deny that the cool air was nice, once I walked through the front doors of the convenience store. Wearing what I thought was a little more formal than what I was told to wear. A thrifted dark red polo and beige khakis that were a size too big, but I made them work, mainly with water and plenty of time with a hairdryer.

I looked around to see the somewhat bustling interior of the store. People were in two separate lines that lead up to the registers, while some others browsed what few aisles I could see. I felt…anxious? It was my first day of my first job, and I certainly felt like a deer in headlights as I looked around, fixed in place near the entrance. Thoughts rushed through my head like they always do, but this time they were sprinkled with the voice of that little hateful fucking Scrooge everyone has on their shoulder. The idea that I could botch my chances at obtaining this dubiously well paying position at this convenient store spread like wild-fire across my mind and the missing person bulletin boards, but that mattered little to me in comparison to the current issue at hand, even though it nipped at me like an ever increasing cold breeze.

I’m pretty sure I spaced out for a good minute, or however long it took for someone to notice the generically dressed girl standing idly at the front, because the next thing I knew, a middle-aged man had walked in front of me. The first thing I noticed, other than his age, was the plastic name tag on his chest. It had two lines of text; the first was “Marco”, and the second read his title, “Day Manager”. He looked me dead in the eye.

“Are ya ok, Miss?”

He said with a somewhat thick southern accent that bordered on either being annoyed or concerned about the strange girl that had been mimicking a statue not but a few seconds ago.

“W-wa-well I’m here to see the manager, uh, you, about my first day.”

“Ya first day of what?”

He raised an eyebrow, as his eyes squinted to a questioning stare.

“I applied to work for the night shift.”

The second I said that, the look on his face, the one that questioned my very existence, swapped to a facial expression that I can only describe as pissed. He lifted his hand towards me; the thought of him for whatever reason hitting me came to mind, so I flinched a bit as he instead tapped the old watch that was leather bound around his wrist.

“You're an hour late, kid, it’s best if ya just leave.”

He said with such a stern tone, I couldn’t mistake it as anything else. Though my timidity dropped faster than a 1-inch fall.

“Bullshit!”

I said with a firm and audible voice, before I could stop myself.

“What?”

His tone shifted over to confusion, as his eyes widened a little from my sudden bold outburst towards my possible employer.

“Bullshit, no the hell I'm not.”

“Yea? You sayin my watch is wrong?”

I could have said something else, something quippy or perhaps something drastic, but instead I pulled my phone out of my pocket, flipped it open to show him and myself that I was not wrong. It was clear as day; “7:29PM”. The second he saw the time, he smiled a bit, like a silent, proud father seeing his child punch a random bully in the face on the playground.

“Ha, good, you have backbone. We don’t hire pushovers; well I wouldn’t hire a pushover, now get walkin. I have to show ya your duties for the night.”

He turned and started to strode, while he rewinded his watch. I was surprised by his reaction; this fucker really just tested me like fresh meat. It was hard to stay mad at him, mainly because I needed the job. I shoved my phone back into my pocket, behind him, trying to keep up, but the way he moved around people, displays, shelves and so on, did not make it easy to simultaneously keep up and listen to him.

“Okay, first, when ya have the chance, always make sure the shelves are stocked. It may be the night shift, but sometimes you’ll get an up traffic of people getting off work from the nearby factories at least and at most, once a week. They don’t like takin shit, but they sure do like talkin shit. Seriously though, if something they want ain’t on the shelf cause you forgot to stock em, they won’t be all that pleasant. Expect a very steady and slow amount of customers through the night though; gives ya plenty of time between customers and your other duties.”

“What about the other types of customers?”

“Well, that’s a good question now. You’ll get varyin types. Most common now are the workers, travelers, some vacationing folk, hunters, campers, addicts, alcoholics, crazies, some sleep walkers, homeless and maybe a wild animal or two. If ya lucky.”

“And if I’m not?”

“Pray to God.”

“What?”

“I said Rough Housers! Them folk don’t care much to shop.”

“So, trouble makers?”

“No, Rough Housers, they’re uh, not local but they tend to ride near the town close enough to stop by the store, some shop, but the whole lot will be there to loiter. Make sure you don’t let em in yourself.”

“Why?”

“Cuz they won’t come in unless you let them in.”

“That seems very fucking, vampire-esque, why?”

“I’ve been askin the same thing for years now. Also, tone it down on the profanity. I personally don’t mind it, obviously, but never near the customers.”

“What customers?”

We had walked into an area of the store where there were no customers, no one browsing or even walking by. Most were up near the front getting their things checked out to leave. Marco grinned a bit at this revelation.

“Good catch, but I mean it, no profanity or weird talk around the customers, even if the customers are uh, not of the normal variety.”

I didn’t argue, just nodded along, as it was understandable; it would look bad if an employee were caught on a cussing spree. Probably a capital offense if I was caught doing that, death penalty, I guess. Though the way he emphasized “normal variety”, made me slightly unsettled. He referred to how alcoholics, addicts and even the mentally unstable were normal for the night shift, or just in general, so what were the abnormal variety of customers? I’d soon find out. 

I was aware that my town, in comparison to others nearby, isn't that great. I knew that we have our fair share of issues, but the fact that there were more I was unaware of, was somewhat startling and yet not all that surprising. I had to be realistic, I’m young, of course I didn’t know everything about this town, even though it was small enough where at some point in someone’s life they’d know everyone, but it was still big enough to have a sizable population and there was plenty of land. I had let my brain wander off again, but Marco interrupted my thoughts before I could.

“Hey, are you okay? You're doing that thing again. Do you have a condition? I’m aware you don’t sleep much, which is perfect for the job, but I better not be seein you dozing off when I walk in for the day shift, cause you didn’t get enough winks in one sittin.”

“Wait, what? Uh no, what do you mean by day shift?”

“You read the name tag right? Says the Day Manager. I work during the day. I thought a youngun like you would understand that.”

“I get that, but why isn’t the Night Manager running me through this then?”

He stopped walking all of a sudden, which in turn, made me stop walking. A slight bit of anxiety raised in me, when he did. He scratched at what little hair he had left, but it wasn’t like he was bald, or balding. His head was obviously shaved recently, leaving a thin layer of dark hair on his scalp. It took him a minute to respond, obviously struggling to find a proper answer; as to why, I had no idea at the time.

“Ooh, yeah, well he, hm, quit a while back, haven’t been able to fill the position with someone who’s of proper character. Since that’s the case, I will be leavin ya a list of things to do, now I will check if you did them or not, so don’t be skimpin out on your duties, no matter how trivial they may be.”

“What about the other employees?”

He sighed a bit in response.

“Well, that’s the other thing, you're the only Night Shift Employee, for now at least, well, except the Night Janitor; I believe he’s already here too, you’ll see him later.”

“I’m one of two Night Shift Employees for a 12 hour shift?”

“Yep. That gonna be a problem?”

He gave me a different look. A look that told me, “hey, you better not be backing out now, missy”, so instead I asked him.

“I assume that’s why the pay is—-“

“Yes, that’s why the pay is quite generous. Now you have any more questions about this, or may I proceed in givin ya your other duties, don’t have a whole lotta of time?”

He was definitely annoyed with how many questions I was asking, and of course, being the curious person I am, would’ve asked further, but he was right, if he didn’t have a lot of time to show me the ropes, then that should be priority. Even though the new red flags bothered me more than the old. It can’t be that bad.

“Oh, uh, sure.”

“Good, don’t want to be holdin ya hand.”

For the short time we had left, I did my best to process all the tasks, duties, tips, tricks, locations of stored stock and etc that were placed upon me; Marco did well to explain them all in a short and orderly manner somehow. While doing so, we passed a door that I assumed was a closet that had the faint smell of something earthy? Like if dirt and wood died a bit leaving this certain odd smell that was neither pleasant or unpleasant, more like a mixed bag of feelings that metamorphosed into an odor. Marco didn’t bring it up, so I tried my best to ignore it while we were in that specific area, putting on my best poker face, so I wouldn’t alert him to how I was this close to gagging a bit from the sucker punch to my nose.

By the end, the idea that I had a work load fit for 10 men did not phase me all that much. I can’t 100% describe why it didn’t, but simply put it, I’ve always enjoyed labor, even if it is tedious and grueling. I never understood why that was the case for me. Sure, I was okay with reading a book, playing cards or cooking came to mind, but working was something different. The slight satisfaction that came with completing a task was somehow worth it for me. I was always told I came from a family of hard workers, which I find to be stupid, because I can name at least 3 assholes in my family who would rather die than pick up a shovel, and that's not even counting all of them.

Marco seemed slightly phased but for other reasons. Probably by how unphased I was about the shit load of information I had apparently processed, also maybe the fact that it was obvious that I was aware of the prominent red flags but I hadn’t asked as many questions as he expected.

He lifted an eyebrow, and scratched his head, while he took a minute to say.

“So, ya good for the night?”

“Sure.”

“Hm, you are one weird kid, but nothin wrong with ya being fine with the work. It's a nice bit of fresh air, I guess. Before you actually start, my phone number’ is written on the corkboard in the break room for any emergencies or even just questions, but I prefer you to talk to the Janitor first before you call me; don't wanna be waken me up at 3AM in the mornin for a question on how to handle change or a rabid deer. Say, if ya get into any real trouble, like needin the law, the deputy’s cell is on the board too, he’s a friend of the store.”

“Wh—”

“He’s in the closet, passed it 10 minutes ago, the one that smells like a fresh grave. He’s quite the character, but does the job well, and he’s friendly.”

I was going to ask why the personal phone number of a police officer was written in such a public area, but at least I now know that I was correct on the door being a closet. He looked at his watch and whistled.

“Gotta get goin now, almost 8, and I don’t like stayin past my hours. Oh, yeah, wait.”

He delved a hand into his fanny pack that was positioned on his side, to take out a piece of white plastic. Extending his arm out with the plastic in hand, to show it was a name tag. What was printed on it was my name, and the role of Night Shift Employee.

“Wear it at all times during ya shift; ya don’t want em mistaken ya for someone else.”

I awkwardly grabbed it out of his hand and pinned it on to my shirt. Wait, who would mistake me as someone else? Before I could ask, he said, “Welcome to the Night Shit, good luck,” then turned towards the break room and sped walked away, not giving me a chance to get a word in edgewise. Well, in highsight, what could have I said that wouldn’t have annoyed him further?

Marco, till this day, still doesn’t like to answer questions, especially towards the weirder aspects of the store or town. He likes to dodge or change the subject by using the same few excuses, and somehow he’s gotten away with it every time. Yesterday, out of genuine curiosity while being handed off the figurative torch, I asked.

“What’s with the coffee machine?”

Marco looked at me while he grabbed a cup of coffee to go.

“Hm? What about it?”

“Well, it’s always clean, and never runs out of coffee, right?”

Marco sighed, before he said, “Abigail, it's a coffee machine, people here including myself and you run on it like an alcoholic needs their booze. Why would it ever be empty or filthy?”

“I’m aware of that, Marco, but no one ever refills it or cleans it, even the drip tray is empty when I check. It’s just always clean.”

“Well, who knows.”

“You, probably.”

He took a long sip of his joe, smacking his lips in odd contentment with the bland brew, “And what makes ya think that?”

“I don’t know, perhaps the fact that you're a wealth of knowledge about this crap hole of a town, you tell me?”

“Abigail, what's wrong with you? I get you’re a curious gal, but you don’t ask me these things. Did something happen? Did Keaton come back? I told that no good salt- lickin weasel shit that he ain’t allowed on the premises no more after the whole goose incident.”

“No, Keaton wasn’t here; I’m just asking about the haunted coffee machine, Marco, aren’t you at all curious about it?”

I noticed that he’d been glancing at his watch constantly during our talk, which made me consider asking why, but adding another question to the imaginary box may just make it implode.

“Well, if you believe it’s haunted, then sure, it’s haunted. If not, maybe it’s just one of em fancy models; ya know it never hurts to have something like that, especially with how busy the shop gets. Never know when anyone will have the time.

“Marco, I have the time, the other employees on the day shift have the time, so that’s not what I was saying, I was—“

“Welp, sorry to cut this lovely conversation short, but you know I don’t like staying past my shift; Marla is waitin for me back home.”

He said as he turned away from me, and speed walked away, he wasn’t one for grace, sure efficiency, but that’s like your mechanic uncle making a good engine out of plastic bottles, soda cans, AA batteries, copper wire and rubber bands; it may not look pretty, far from it, but it somehow runs better than most others. The way he raced away made it look like he needed to take a real bad piss, not further feeding into what I thought was my harmless curiosity. 

“Marco!” I called after him, my voice raised in slight annoyance that he was dodging another of our conversations, and somehow he’s gotten away with it once again. I could chase him down, but I haven’t known Marco to break under pressure, so why bother. 

That reminds me, I need to bring up a more recent experience, something that would probably be more interesting than you all getting to know my coworker. It was last night, the shift had been going at its usual pace, that of a snail. Some passerby bought things for the road, then there was the large group of factory workers who bought a ton of our stock from toiletries, canned goods, cartons of cigarettes, alcohol, and the rare few who bought fruit while the rest treated the produce aisle like the plague.

One, by the name of Leon Brooks was the last to check out. He’s a local and a regular, and I'd be surprised not to see him a few times a week. A man I know little about, except for the few things that came up in our brief exchanges. I believe that he’s in his late 50s; with not one speck of hair on his head and face wasn’t covered in white and gray, he oddly resembled Pierce Brosnan.

“How ya doin Abigail?”, he asked in a tired but friendly manner.

“Same as usual, Leon.”

“And Rosco? Didn’t see em around.”

“He’s cleaning the men’s bathroom.”

“Ah, my condolences.""

It was an odd response, but I didn’t take the time to analyze it, while I scanned cans of pork and beans.

“Hey, uh, Abigail? Ya know any weddings going on in town?”

Another odd thing to say; I took a minute to actually comprehend this one, being that an answer is actually expected out of me, though I didn’t pay much attention to the happenings with the people in town. At most, any gossip I heard was all in the confines of the store, or from Rosco.

“Not that I know of, why do you ask?”

“Well, there’s a woman in a white dress standing in the parking lot, so?”, he said as he pointed in said direction. I instantly turned my head towards the glass doors and windows to see… nothing. In response towards the near empty parking lot, he’d say, “The hell? She was just there a second ago,” while scratching his head and taking a few steps forwards towards the front doors, visibly squinting his eyes as if he was trying to make out the details of a blurry image. I could have fed into his probable paranoia, checked the outside for myself; it did really come to mind, but the fact that I had common sense and didn’t plan on reenacting a horror movie cliche is what stopped me, and should for most others.

“Leon?”

He turned his head towards me.

“Do you want a paper bag for 10 cents?”

Before responding, he looked back out into the parking lot, presumably where he once saw this woman in white. He laughed,  while he walked back towards the register.

“Uh, no, I’ll just keep to the plastic bags.”

Why do I even bother to ask anymore? The last time I sold a paper bag was the previous winter, about a few dozen of them, and that was to a family who needed kindling for their camping trip. Which is apparently the only use for these crinkling, soggy-ass, tear happy disappointments. The owners have been pushing me to offer them to each and every customer due to what they say is “to promote the use of sustainable materials.” Even though we both know that Marco had accidentally put in an order for paper bags, which  weren’t the accident themself, but how he put in an order for 10x the amount that we needed, and the supplier won’t take back the excess. Something I will never let him live down.

Leon had paid in exact change, then he gingerly exited the store, towards his old black camry. You’d think that would be the end of it, but not even a minute after he left, another person walked in, which would be normal if it weren’t for the fact that it was the so-called lady in white. She was unremarkably attractive, the sort of generic beauty you’d see in a magazine, but the more I looked at her, the more I saw the peculiar aspects to her appearance. She didn’t have any shoes, which isn’t as abnormal as one may think; we get plenty of people, generally homeless or hippies who don’t wear shoes who come in for reasons like warmth, or to spend what little they have on the necessities, though in the case of hippies, they loiter or buy up the produce section, but this was a woman in a perfectly pristine white gown.

I think she caught me looking at her, because the next thing I know, she was staring right back at me. Her eyes were bloodshot, and if it weren’t for the fact that I could see the slight tint of brown in her irises, I’d think them to be pitch black. She probably thought it was rude of me to stare at her and was currently retaliating by throwing her own glare back at me, or possibly she was a drug addict or mentally unstable. Either way, I’d treat her with some form of caution. It’s like messing with a grizzly bear: you either get a response that tells you they don’t care or possibly get your face ripped off.

I thought it best to leave her be, since she technically wasn’t breaking any laws, except for the fact that we require customers to wear some form of foot wear when entering the store. She was shoeless and tracking in dirt, which will be Rosco’s fight, and not mine, once he finishes his battle with the men’s bathroom. Actually he has been in there for a while now.

To think of it, when I looked out into the parking lot earlier, the only cars out there were mine, Rosco’s and Leon’s. Where did she actually fucking come from? The rational first thought would be that she walked in from somewhere around town, this store may be remote enough to where the property is surrounded by trees, but it is at the very edge of town. It should take at least 40, maybe 50 minutes to jog here from the closest piece of civilization. The layout of the town is very weird, but still, technically the store fell on the very edge. For her to walk barefoot through a woodland area all the way to the store made no sense, and even if it did, why at night? Anyone with a brain, especially a local, wouldn’t be walk around at night with all the shenanigans going on; from drunk hunters who can’t tell the difference between a buck and person in the dark, all the way to wild animals cracked up on blood thirst or actual narcotics. It’s why most people in this town carry, legally or not, but it didn’t look like she had anything on her but her dress, but then again you never know.

I was tempted to call the deputy, especially after Leon and the possibility that this woman isn’t in her right mind. Before I could think any further on that option, I felt someone watching me, like eyes were burrowing into my general direction. At the time I had been filling out a sizable crossword puzzle that Rosco handed me at the start of the shift, believing it could dull my boredom since he knew marijuana and the plethora of drugs he had were not an option, and he still tried to offer me some. So far, I just started and I’m almost done. I don’t get why people have issues or trouble figuring out crossword puzzles; maybe the lack of people in this town that can read beyond an 8th grade level, an achievement I'm sure somewhere around the country. Without moving my head away from the crossword, I looked up towards the source of this feeling, and there she was, at the edge of an aisle, occupied with whatever product was stocked there. Though that’s not what unnerved me about it, not the fact that she kept staring at me, but the way she was fucking doing it. 

This lady’s head was a full 180 degree turn towards me while the rest of her body just acted like she had simply picked through what I could then see were cans of dog food. I don’t think she blinked once either; her eyes looked more red, but it was sorta hard to tell from this distance.

Most people, I’d believe, would possibly start losing their shit at that moment, or they’d be silently mentally screaming, but again, she hadn’t done anything wrong but act like Regan MacNeil. Ever deal with a winged cow? Probably not, but all I'll say for now is that it was way more horrifying and was far more frightening to deal with. I looked back down at the crossword, more intent on finishing it, than having to bare witness to whatever the good golly fuck that was.

About a few minutes later, a shadow fell upon me. I looked up to see the lady, this time without a physical interpretation of the daily life of an owl. She placed a can of dog food on the counter, and smiled, still giving me that unmoving stare. I didn’t even hear her walk over, I think my mind sorta zoned in on the crossword a bit. That may explain why I didn’t hear her, but still. I put on my best good-employee facade, giving my own slight but noticeable smile as I set the crossword and pen in front of me in a little cubby under the register. I grabbed the can as I asked and looked at her without making more direct eye contact, “Is that all Ma’am?”.

She tilted her head, then took a long minute to respond, “Yes, I think so, maybe, no, perhaps, hmmmm yes.”, she spoke with a voice that was akin to a lullaby mixed with a smoker’s cough. Her voice was raspy but gentle, like she had choked down a couple dozen lit cigarettes a day for the last month. The way she spoke made me think she might have been drunk, but she sounded playful, and I didn’t smell any alcohol on her breath, a scent I’m quite familiar with. So, great, I interacted with a psychotic supernatural entity, which I’ll be honest if I counted every time I interacted with either, I would have several hundred nickels on hand.

“Good, hope your shopping went well.”

She growled in response, the sort of deep but quiet growl that can’t come from a human being, and if it did, I’d have to give her props on her mimicry.

“That’ll be 3.15.”

I looked at her, then for the first time she stopped staring at me, the lady looked down, while she patted her sides. She did so for a few seconds and then looked back at me, staring, while she opened her mouth. Her jaw unhinged into a big smile, further than what I would believe to be feasible. She placed her hand inside, as she slowly pulled out a crumpled green piece of paper. The lady held it out towards me, while her mouth slowly closed, I could vaguely tell that it was an old dry 5 dollar bill. I was aware that trying to take the dollar from her would be stupid, on so many levels in fact, that I don’t think there’s a number to describe it, but what else could I do that wouldn’t irritate her. I awkwardly tried to take it from her hand, but the second my hand touched the dollar, she grabbed my wrist with inhuman speed, tightly, so tight in fact that it started to hurt.

“Hey, what the fuck?”, I had said without realizing that I had broken Marco's rule about profanity around customers. Maybe I’d get off Scott free, but Marco would probably point out my use of vulgar language over the low-budget stereotypical horror movie character that technically assaulted me, if I were to bring up that detail. I tried to yank my wrist out of her death grip, and the thought of punching her straight in the jaw came to mind, but I'd felt like that would have been a useless endeavor. 

She let go of the dollar while she held on to my wrist, putting a finger up to her mouth, “Shhh”. She leaned in, while she looked me straight in the eyes, her blood shot ridden eyes were worse than before. She said to me, “You know them, don’t you, the man, the man in my head?”.

“Who?”

“The man, a grin so wide, his teeth so white, their eyes so bright, skin so pale, a body so thin, he peers within, sees all your sins, knows your fears, don’t you know him?”

“I don’t know who you're talking about, but Ma’am, please let go of my wrist, don’t make me call the deputy.”

She started to laugh, it wasn’t creepy, more uncontrolled and joyful, but she abruptly stopped, to say “Oh, you don’t know, it’s okay.” She leaned in over the counter, to the point where she was an inch away from my face.

“Because…he….knows…you.”

She let go of my wrist, and stood back straight, staring at me once again, while I rubbed my wrist. I wanted to get this interaction done with, so I opened the register, and placed the 5 in, then I handed her change back. She didn’t take it, and walked away without the can of dog food, somehow leaving a larger trail of dirt along her path than previously. The lady walked straight out of the store, out into the parking lot, onto the road, past the tree line where I couldn’t see her. The dark almost seemed to envelop her, like all light in that single point ceased to exist for a moment to shroud her exit.

My attention was on my wrist now. I rubbed the bruise in the shape of a hand print that encapsulated it, I contemplated on calling Deputy Heller again. It was already over and it wasn’t like he could have done anything, other than make a report. By the time he would have gotten here, she would have been long gone, who’s to say she isn’t already in the wind. Wouldn’t hurt, though my wrist sure did, also who in the flying fuck was she refering to.

A loud “BANG” made me jump, before my anxiety was relieved when I heard a male voice say.

“Holy Reverse Grail, that was a shit show!”

Rosco had slammed the men’s bathroom door open. He walked into my line of sight, with stained rubber gloves on and a plunger in hand. A lit blunt hanged from his mouth but a bit of a frown to go along with it. The plunger was devastated, as it looked like it had lost a fight with a wolf using a paper shredder.

Rosco said in his version of an annoyed voice, which was weird excitement mixed with a slightly angry raised voice, “It was like Nagasaki had a baby in there! Look at what the toilet did to my plunger Gordon. I don’t know what in the two hells happened there, but I bet it was one of those workers that came in here earlier, or maybe that fat truck driver, maybe it was Oscar!”

He stopped walking, looked down at the dirt covered trail in front of his feet, and then proceeded to look back at me, his head slightly tilted down to look at what I assume was my wrist.

“What did I miss, and do I need to get Louise?”

Seems like we both had our own traumatic ordeals tonight, but what’s more enlightening at the moment is the fact that I now knew what Leon meant.",6,1769496104.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1qo6c91,https://www.reddit.com/r/XmenEvolution/comments/1qo6c91/xmen_evolution_oc_concept_feedback_request/,X-Men Evolution OC Concept Feedback Request.,"X-Men Evolution Fanfic Character concept feedback.

So I have this concept for the main character of an X-Men Evolution Fanfic I'm planning on doing called ""Rev It Up!"" It's a crossover with Chainsaw Man, where there are Mutants who have X-Genes that give them powers of the Devils from the anime.

Here's a preliminary profile of the MC, the Chainsaw Devil:

Name: Calvin Vaughan 

Age: 16 

Appearance: A sixteen-year-old boy with brown hair, brown eyes, an average build, and olive skin marked by features that implied Scottish, Scotch-Irish, French, German, Italian, Creole, and Native American heritage. Though most notably, as a very noticeable pull chord on his chest, not unlike a chainsaw pull cord.

Attire: Typically wears a pair of 5.11 cargo pants, a white button-up shirt he keeps slightly untucked and baggy, a pair of brown Converse high tops, and a pair of Hemingway glasses.

Powers: Is able to transform his body to gain Chainsaw limbs and a chainsaw beast form when his cord is pulled. The chord itself is able to lock itself to avoid being pulled by mistake, something he learned after a few instances of it happening in his sleep. He also has a healing factor, which is what allows him to replenish any lost blood during and after his transformation and seals around his saws to keep him from bleeding out, similar to Logan's claws. 

Hybrid form: If his chainsaw cord is pulled while he has enough blood for the transformation, then his head will morph into a demonic, mechanical shape with long, jagged fangs and a chainsaw handle on the back. Large chainsaws will emerge from his forehead, arms, and legs; he is able to retract and extend any of them at will. If Calvin's chainsaw cord is pulled while he does not have enough blood, then a chainsaw blade will partially emerge from his face.

Personality: His personality is loosely based on a few different characters for reasons that are elaborated on in his background description. Those being Denji, Sans, Grimmjow, and Yuji Itadori. He has the usual demeanor and relatable, simple motivations of Denji (Food, having his own space, getting through school, having time for his hobbies, a girlfriend, etc.) As well as Denji's noncommital attitude (finding the whole conflict between Xavier and Magneto pointless because he's seen it before in history books), the sarcasm, laziness, apathy, puns, and borderline nihilism of Sans, the friendliness and loyalty of Yuji when he meets people he likes or to his family, and the confrontational Smoke Demon nature of Grimmjow.

Background: He comes from a family of nine with six other brothers (three older and three younger), and as the middle child, he is constantly on the short end of the pecking order, meaning that inter-sibling fights are common over limited space and resources, but he gets along with his brothers relatively well. His youngest brother, Fate (short for Lafayette), is his favorite because the two are practically glued together, but his oldest brother, Owen, is a close second. Even if he's lower on the pecking order, his brothers will do anything for him, and he's the same way, but even then, it doesn't stop them from nearly turning the kitchen into a replay of the first third down of the Super Bowl over the last pop tart.

Here's his full family lineup:

Dad: Retired Gunnery Sgt. and Sniper Ddraig Goch D. ""Dragon"" Vaughan 

Mom: Carys Vaughan 

Oldest brother: Owen

2nd Oldest: Dylan 

3rd Oldest: Arthur 

1st younger brother: Edward 

2nd Younger brother: Connor

Youngest brother: Lafayette, or Fate for short.

Here's an example of Calvin's dialogue when Magneto tries to recruit him. Context: Magneto is entering the outdoor clubhouse Calvin and his brothers built for themselves to hang out in. It's about the size of a small cabin, and when Magneto arrives, he can hear Calvin’s favorite song: I Don't Care Anymore by Phil Collins playing through a boom box.

Calvin: \[Looks at Magneto as he finishes his thesis statement on his cause, before returning to his Peanuts comic book\] Not interested.

Magneto: \[vibrates Magnetism in controlled anger.\] You find comfort in these childish, ink-and-paper fantasies. That sad little boy in your book... he worries about a red-haired girl and a beagle. I carry the weight of an entire species on my shoulders. We are not the same. 

Calvin: \[Looks at him, rolls his eyes, and turns back to his comic book, turning the volume up on his music.\]

Magneto: \[His patience would be gone. With a flick of his wrist, the Peanuts comic would be ripped from Calvin's hands. The staples would fly out of it with the sound of gunshots, embedding themselves in the wall behind him. Each page would tear itself from the binding and plaster itself against the far wall, held in place by his power.\] There. Now the distractions are gone. You will look at me. And you will listen. You do not have the luxury of being 'not interested' in your own future.

Calvin: Calvin: ... Okay, 1. You owe me a new comic book. 2. Yes, I do have that luxury, because I'm lazy and apathetic. Trust me, you're better off trying to find another mutant who actually wants to follow your revolution than someone who doesn't care about it in any way, shape, or form. Why waste your energy on me?

Magneto: \[He stops his assault, a look of profound disappointment on his face. He straightens his cloak, his demeanor shifting from anger to that of a weary monarch.\]

""I see now. I have been mistaken. I thought I saw a mutant of immense, wasted potential. But all I see is a boy. You cling to your simple world because you are too cowardly and too weak to face the real one.""

\[He turns to leave, pausing at the door for his final, devastating statement.\]

I see now. I have been mistaken. I thought I saw a mutant of immense, wasted potential. But all I see is a boy. You cling to your simple world because you are too cowardly and too weak to face the real one.

\[He turns to leave, pausing at the door for his final, devastating statement.\]

Stay here, then. Drown in your apathy. But know this: the tide of history is coming for you and for everyone you hold dear. It does not care if you are 'interested' or not. And when that tide is washing away everything you love, you will remember this day, and the man who offered you a means to fight back. \[Leaves.\]

Calvin: \[Rolls his eyes as he picks up a Calvin and Hobbes comic book and starts reading.\] Yeah, keep telling yourself that, old man.

Here's how the X-Men recruitment would go:

Setting: The Vaughan living room. It’s ""controlled chaos."" Two brothers are wrestling over a game controller, and ""Dragon"" Vaughan is sitting in a recliner, cleaning a lens kit, looking at Xavier with the narrowed eyes of a man who has spotted a high-value target from two miles away.

Xavier: ""Mr. Vaughan, I assure you, my Institute offers a curriculum tailored specifically for... unique individuals like Calvin. We provide a safe environment where he can master his—""

Dragon: ""His 'gifts'? Professor, I’m a sniper. I’ve spent my life looking for things that don't fit the landscape. My son has a pull-cord in his chest and turns into a hardware store. We know what he is. The question is, why do \*you\* care?""

Scott: (Standing stiffly by the door) ""We just want to help him, sir. The world isn't always kind to people who are different.""

Jean: (Nodding) ""We provide a community. A place where he doesn't have to hide.""

Calvin: (Leaning against the doorframe, eating a piece of cold pizza) ""I’m not hiding. I’m just busy. Between school, keeping Fate from sticking his finger in a light socket, and making sure Dylan doesn't 'borrow' my boots, I don't really have time for a 'gifted' retreat. Plus, uniforms? Hard pass.""

Xavier: (Smiling thinly, sensing the ""Sans"" energy radiating off Calvin) ""No uniforms during school hours, I assure you. And while the training is rigorous, we believe in a balanced lifestyle.""

Calvin: ""Balanced? That sounds like more work. I already have a C- average. Why would I want to go to a harder school?""

Xavier: (Pausing, his eyes twinkling as he 'reads' the environment—the four boys sharing one couch, the noise, the lack of a single square inch of personal space) ""I understand. It is a big adjustment. However, I did notice your current living situation is... vibrant. At the Xavier Institute, we have a great deal of space. Every student is provided with their own private quarters.""

Calvin: (Stops chewing) ""...Come again?""

Xavier: ""A private room. Your own desk. Your own bed. A door that \*locks\*. And, if I’m not mistaken, a very high-speed internet connection that you wouldn't have to share with six brothers.""

The Room Goes Silent.

Calvin: (Looks at Owen, then at his dad, then back to Xavier) ""A door that locks? Like... for real? I can just... be in there? And no one’s gonna drop an elbow on me at 3:00 AM because they had a bad dream?""

Jean: (Suppressing a smile) ""Usually, yes.""

Calvin: (Slowly sets the pizza crust down) ""You son of a bitch, I'm in.""

Older brothers: (Nearly do a spit take at the Rick and Morty line while their mom glares at them.)

Dragon: (Sighs, looking at Xavier) ""You’re a devious man, Professor.""

Xavier: ""I simply believe in finding the right motivation, Sergeant.""

Here's an alternative recruitment scene for Calvin with Xavier, to show a different side of him:

Calvin: \[After Xavier finishes his sales pitch\] Quick question, professor. Are you by any chance friends with a guy named Magneto? Because your pitch is very similar to his. Obviously very different, but similar.

Xavier: We were friends, but we've since reached an impasse.

Calvin: Okay, then I got another question for you: What part of ""I'm not interested"" do you people not understand? I mean, am I speaking in a different language? Or are you just not listening? 

Xavier: You have a keen eye for patterns, Calvin. Erik and I do share a common goal—the safety of our kind. But where he offers a throne, I offer a school. Where he demands service, I offer a choice. As for your lack of interest... I hear you perfectly. I am not here to force you into a uniform. I am here because the world is becoming a very dangerous place for someone with a 'pull-chord' in their chest, and I'd rather you be prepared for it.

Scott: You’ve got a lot of nerve. The Professor is offering you a way out of the gutters, a chance to actually mean something, and you’re treating him like he’s a terrorist? We’re not 'listening' because we’ve seen what happens to mutants who think they can just 'check out' and be left alone. You’re not being independent, Calvin; you’re being a bum wasting a kindness you don't even deserve.

Jean: It’s not that we aren't listening, Calvin. It’s that it’s hard to believe you actually feel that way. Most people are afraid, or angry, or excited when they discover what they are. You just seem... bored. Comparing us to Magneto is a clever way to keep us at arm's length, but eventually, you’re going to run into a problem that 'not caring' won't solve. We just want to be there when that happens.

Calvin: \[Sits down\] Like I told Magneto. I'm not an ideological person. I have a moral compass, but I am also lazy, apathetic, and have simple motivations. I don't do big conflicts or causes. I keep my nose down and do what I want. My concerns are with myself, my family, and that's it. \[Looks at Xavier\] So why are you looking for me? The worst possible match for your school?

Xavier: Actually, Calvin, you are exactly the kind of person I am looking for. My school isn't just for soldiers or activists; it is for anyone who needs a place to simply be. If your only concern is protecting your family and living your life, then we share the same goal—I just have a larger 'family' than most. I don't want to change your compass; I want to give you a safe place to use it.

Scott: You’re right about one thing: you are a bad match. We have people here who would give anything for a fraction of the power you’re currently trying to hide. If you think you can just sit on the sidelines while Magneto and his goons try to start a war, you’re not just lazy—you’re delusional. Eventually, the 'big conflicts' come for everyone, whether they care about them or not.

Calvin: \[Flips Scott off.\]

Jean: It’s rare to meet someone so... settled. Most of us are constantly fighting with who we are or who we want to be, but you seem perfectly fine with being 'simple'. But I have to wonder, Calvin: if you truly only care about your family, what happens when the rest of the world decides your family is the problem? You say you don't do causes, but I think you’d be surprised at what you’re willing to do when your 'simple' life is threatened.

Calvin: ... You guys have a really weird definition of ""choice"". Do you realize that everything you just said is practically designed to make a person think they only really have one option? Because seriously, that's not a choice. That's veiled coercion.

He'd echo this when Evan tells him how he joined.

Calvin: So wait, when you joined, you refused at first, got framed by your best friend, and then Xavier said he'd use his influence to get you out of jail if you came here? Evan, that's not a choice; they literally used your lack of options to corner you. ""There's always a choice, we just want you to make the right one,"" my ass! Just when I thought I couldn't hate Scott even more than I already do, he goes and pulls this bullshit.

Also, when Xavier gives everyone the ""choice"" of going to Camp Ironside (essentially a boot camp run by Sgt. Hawk) or doing survival training with Wolverine in ""Survival of the Fittest."" 

Calvin: What kind of choice is that?! Both of those are situations I avoid like the plague! That's not a choice, it's a lose-lose situation!

If he does accept, I could see him settling right in at the Institute and quickly clocking Kurt and Evan as the guys he's likely to get along with the most.

He'd peg Scott as too rigid for his liking, but sees enough similarities between him and his brother Owen that he's okay with him.

He'd see Kitty as cute and approachable, but not his type, and would immediately see how bad Jean and Scott have it for each other.

He'd see Ororo as a woman who has a body that is perfectly sculpted for motherhood (cuz you know, she's got that vibe) and a personality to match, and would be astounded that she doesn't have a husband and five kids or, at the very least, a boyfriend.

He'd see that he definitely likes Logan the best out of all the Teachers.

And he'd admit that Xavier is better at his job than he initially thought.

Rogue, meanwhile... He wouldn't know how to peg her.

If I had to guess, I'd say Calvin would actually be more likely to get along with the Brotherhood kids like Lance, Fred, Todd, and Pietro rather than being antagonistic with them like the others. 

There's also the fact that Calvin could totally relate to Fred's love of food and could be the one guy who would be personally interested in Kitty and Lance pulling a Breakfast Club and getting together just like Claire and Bender, precisely because he'd be watching it with a bag of popcorn and a soda just to see what happens.

Calvin: On a lighter note... You do know that Kitty has the hots for you, right?

Lance: \[Does a spit take while drinking some water from a bottle as they exit the locker room\] What?!

Calvin: You never noticed?

Lance: Obviously not!

Calvin: Well, I'm telling you now.

And while Calvin has no such experience with child abuse due to his family being the best thing he could ask for, he'd still be able to understand Lance because not being seen is something he can relate to from being a middle child.

How would Scott react if he overheard this? 

Calvin: \[Leans against the lockers as Lance gets changed after gym class\] Those Cigar burns?

Lance: Huh? \[Pulls on his shirt\]

Calvin: Those spot scars on your back. They from a cigar?

Lance: ... Try a fireplace poker. \[Slips on his jacket\] What I got for spilling paint in the garage.

Calvin: Well, that's fucked up on five different levels...

And when things go south, when mutants are exposed, and Magneto's words to him were proven right? 

Even in that kind of moment, he wouldn't feel crushed or regretful; he'd be pissed. Pissed that someone he doesn't like actually had a point, even if it was just once.

And I was also thinking that given that his chainsaw blades are a part of his body and notably come out of his body, I'm thinking that the metal they're made of is organic, and thus non-magnetic. 

So another version of the X-Men's side of the recruitment is that it still comes after Magneto, but instead of getting defensive, Calvin just acts the same way he did with Magneto with Xavier.

Also, I forgot to mention that both scenes with Magneto and Xavier in these new versions would be happening in a large club and tree house (that being a clubhouse built near a tree with a tree house attached to it) where all the siblings would hang out, but now is mostly used by Calvin and the younger siblings because the older siblings are all too busy with college or high-school stuff. 

In this meeting with Xavier he'd be reading a Calvin and Hobbes comic book or just the newspaper and particularly funny pages, while having a breakfast of toast with honey, butter and jam with a coffee that he turned into a mocha using an at home hack of coco powder, sugar and half & half in his favorite 18th century style tall ceramic coffee mug.

Other things Calvin likes, particularly in regards to music is rock bands and old music going back to the 50s to the 80s, in contrast to the current 90s era when the show takes place.

Such as, as mentioned, one of his favorite songs, for example, is ""I Don't Care Anymore"" by Phil Collins.

Also, to put him in the same age range as Kitty, Kurt, and Evan, I decided to have his birthdate be May 11th, 1974, so he technically lived in two of his favorite eras, just not completely.

The show aired in the Early 2000s, but it was very much set in the 90s, though as a specific date was never given, so I always assumed it was at least 1990 to 1991. CD players, the lingo, the cars, arcades, clothing, it was all very 90s coded. 

I can only imagine that if Calvin were playing I Don't Care Anymore on a boom box while Magneto was in the clubhouse during the draft of the recruitment, it would have made him even more aggravated. 

I'm also thinking that Calvin could take up a part-time job as a caddie at the Bayville County Country Club. Get up to some real Caddie Shack-type shenanigans. Certain patrons might actually enjoy Calvin's personality, as it's exactly the kind of change in pace and challenge they'd want to push their A game when golfing or just have an actual intelligent conversation with someone who isn't a ladder climber.

And Calvin is also a fan of Golden Girls. Dorothy is his favorite.

I’m 30 and attempting to be social in 2026 — brave, I know. New to reddit so teach me the ropes plzz haha

Looking to meet people aged 25–40 who take care of themselves and enjoy being active.

Ideal activities include:

	•	Walks or runs (coastal paths > treadmills)

	•	Coffee that turns into a long chat

	•	Gym sessions (spotting each other + complaining included)

	•	Movies (yes, sitting still counts as recovery)

If you’re friendly, and down for actual meetups (not just “yeah we should catch up sometime”), let’s fix our social lives together.

1qo67xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentTexts/comments/1qo67xt/hi_there_b/,Hi there B,"It’s been a couple of months since I last saw you, you had a black jacket that matched your boots, you looked gorgeous I always loved the way your hair played with the wind, with my fingers and from time to time the way it got in between a kiss or two.

But you also looked sad, you had a lot in your head that I didn’t knew how to handle, I am really sorry for that, it broke me when you said you were leaving, I remember the feeling of wanting to chase after your car, like a child that doesn’t want to be left behind, like a dog that doesn’t want to be forgotten.

I paralyzed, the whole world stopped and colors started to fade, my heart really missed a beat seeing you walk away. I ran, I walk I crawled the whole city that day, from left to right, up and down, even upside down searching for you, hoping, hoping I would find you on the next corner, on the next coffee shop on the next pizza place, even though I knew you didn’t liked pizza, I was really hoping it was you, every girl I saw wearing a jacket, all of them had your face but non of them were you.

I kept walking I kept hoping, that I would find you, but then it hit me like a truck, it was around midnight when I realized that you were gone, that I realized the sun was gone and even stars were hiding, finally my body and mind gave up, there was no next corner to run after, I looked back and like a ghost I thought I saw you on the corner of my eye, I looked again but I was all alone.

After a couple of hours of not knowing where to go I decided to go back to the house we shared, maybe you didn’t left, maybe it was a nightmare, maybe I would wake up in any second and see you next to me.

It didn’t happened, I opened the door and like a haunted house all ghosts came out to greet me, not with loud noises but with an absolute silence, I went to the bedroom and there it was, a void where my heart used to be, I searched for you under the bed, the blankets, behind the lamp, on the corners of the ceiling I ran to the kitchen, opened every drawer, the house felt so empty, maybe I was empty…

If I knew that was the last time I was seeing you I would have wrote you hundreds of songs, stole every kiss I could and imagine a thousand ways of making you laugh, I would have took a lot of pictures of us, instagram keeps suggesting couple photos, I keep saving them, I know, I am stupid.

I really thought I would not love anyone again until I met you, I really wish you could have stayed with me, now I see you from time to time on my dreams, having lunch next to me, watching me while I work, going out to the gym, coffees, museums, I enjoy all the dates we have in my dreams, all the time we spend together.

I am really grateful that I got the chance of meeting you, from all the billions of stars out there, to be at the same timeline, the exact space and time for us to share some laughter, the chance that God gave me to see a beautiful smile right in front of me, I was blessed.

I hope you are happy, wherever you are.

But the private apartments have a lot more privacy. I'm talking about folks like my neighbors. Today, I was pissed off I had to go to class early. The weather is cold. It's harder to wake up. I try so I can go to JWC, get a coffee and come back to cook a high protein breakfast.

But I mean like, fucking...not everything works out as planned. But in the apartments we can improvise a lot better. At the dorms, I was often subjected to group rules. Shared bathrooms on the floor. Someone took a dump in the shower once and the RA refused to find out who.

At the apartments, I noticed one of neighbors walking her dog. Her boyfriend, Richard (aka DICK) was out to get gas for his car. She strolls their dog around the block and came back with a bag in her hand. Then my fucking neighbor, Dooler, came running downstairs in his underwear and robe rushing to ask my other neighbor where she got her drugs. She showed the bag had dog shit in it and offered him to take it for free. Next thing I saw on my way back home while checking the mail was a bunch of dogshit rubbed on Dick and his girlfriend's door. I ran into my apartment and laughed my ass off for an entire hour. I knocked on Dooler's door and he wouldn't answer. I think he ran away for the weekend or he was passed out inside.

I went on my balcony wearing nothing but pants, and wondered what was going to happen. Nothing so far but Dick frowned when I said hello this morning while I was trying to get to school. I had to get coffee at one of the filthy dollar vending machines. It made me shit and I got late to class by 4  minutes. The professor even frowned at me for disrupting class.

1qo65eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyArt/comments/1qo65eh/are_you_looking_what_is_perfection_of_human_life/,are you looking what is perfection of human life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
