1ln9gkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetFriends/comments/1ln9gkl/19f_with_an_innate_and_desperate_need_for/,19F with an innate and desperate need for platonic bonds,"Hi. I've been increasingly feeling disillusioned with my current irl friends because it's become that thing of nothing happens if I don't initiate and frankly I'm tired.

I have this really innate and crushingly deep loneliness inside myself that can only be filled by deep and loving platonic bonds and I've been really struggling to find that in the world. I'm really scared that no-one is out there willing to care for me in the ways I wish to care for other people. 

I'm looking for people who would like something that's more than just a catch up friendship and have some meaningful relationships again. We can be each other's support class <3

About me:
- Name's Logan (yes, like wolverine)
- South African (GMT +2)
- I am a feral little freak.
- a walking, talking comorbidity.
- I am both chronically online & ill.
- a being made up of health issues and spite.
- low empathy autistic
- Special interests include: cats (the OG), dnd, Guild Wars 2, House MD, witchcraft & astrology, reading, coffee, crafts such as crochet & embroidery, fountain pens & their inks.
- I've collected all the demi identities like my own infinity gauntlet. (Demi-girl (she/they), Demiromantic and Demisexual)
- lesbian with a wife (aka my girlfriend who I call my wife)
- I'm a nonbinary barista stereotype by trade.
- I'm more active on tumblr than any other social media, and most can tell.
- I am your favourite liberal's favourite liberal. Objectively too woke for modern society. If you can think of an issue, assume I've got a liberal stance on it.
- I have 10 cats
- a lot of people tell me their first impressions of me are that I am confident and self assured but what they don't know is that many moons ago on the recommendation of my therapist I started making jokes about being way too smart and/or how amazing I am at something instead of making self deprecating jokes and then accidentally grew an ego. Oops.
- I love writing poetry. I have this vision of writing an anthology of narrative poems based off of one of my own world's from my worldbuilding.
- All of my favourite media are my favourites because of their worldbuilding.
- MASSIVE DROPOUT FAN, brennan lee mulligan my beloved.
- court jester at heart
- as you can probably tell, a yapper
- it's been determined that my fatal flaw is loyalty. I'd let the world burn in favour of helping those I love.

I honestly have high standards for my friendships, so be prepared for that. But I also don't think that I am unreasonable. I don't expect you to be available go talk 24/7 but when we are talking I expect you to put in actual effort and not use chatgpt or whatever ai to talk to me. (Yes, this has happened to me.)

I am not easily an agree to disagree person. If it's trivial things like peanutbutter and jam vs peanutbutter and syrup, I'll happily agree to disagree but I refuse to do that with any of my politics or morals.

Ask me about my job as a barista! I've got latte art pics to share <3 or ask me about my sons' full names (2 kittens named Cosmo and Valerian) or ask me about my views on magic

If I seem intriguing, comment or send me a message!

Please DO NOT message me if you have creepy intentions. I am purely here for friendship.

I am NOT interested in talking to the vast majority of cis men because in my experience on reddit they just want to use me to get off. So just don't.

Send me a 🌙 if you read everything please. I would also appreciate a little introduction into who you are as a person or why you feel we'd get along well, please.",2,1751184776.0,InternetFriends,1,1.0,False

First thing some context  - she will ask me to go get her coffee when I leave class. At first I thought it was a once off but it’s becoming a regular thing now. I wouldn’t mind normally but I don’t even offer and she expects it. She has never once offered to pay for the coffee or pay me back or even get me a coffee. One week I spent over £20 on her just on coffee (I limit my own coffee to once or twice a week…) and I’ve never said anything. She also phrases it so weirdly like “do you want the honour of getting me a coffee” like how is that an honour? I even have said no and she’s like can you go get me a coffee and won’t take no for an answer. 

My family also own a restaurant and I have got her food from there on multiple occasions (bearing in mind she has never offered to pay). I never expect her to pay because it’s my fam’s  business but it feels like she knows that and will take advantage. She wanted it for her whole family (of c. 8-10 people) one time and only because her mum told her to pay she did but  I still gave a massive discount on the bill. C. 60% 

This girl has never bought me coffee or got me food.

So the issue, we were going to a concert together. She offered to pick me up and drop me home which I thought was really nice but she then asked me to transfer her £12.50 for parking and £7 for a juice. Am I overreacting that she asked or is it valid? I genuinely wouldn’t mind someone asking because obvs people shouldn’t pay for me but I feel like if it was the other way round I wouldn’t even think to ask considering how much I have done for her - am I being entitled or is that valid? After the concert we had class the next day and even before the concert she goes “you better buy me a coffee tomorrow” 
We are also going to Manchester (we live in London) and she’s already asked for the parking money in Manchester and I assume she will ask fr petrol money as she even sarcastically said “you know it’s gonna take petrol to get us there”  (she has offered to drive us there). Again am I overreacting or is it valid.

Please help,"I (28M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about a year and a half. We’ve had some highs, but honestly, a lot of lows too.

The biggest issue is that I feel completely suffocated. I’m juggling two jobs right now, starting from Monday. She shows up during my breaks, insists on coffee, and keeps me at her place until around 7 PM. Meanwhile, I still have to manage clients for my second job. When I finally get home, she wants to go out again so my only free time is spent sleeping.

When she crashes at my place, she stays for weeks sometimes up to 20 days and won’t give me any space. She gets upset if I go to bed before her, and she constantly changes our plans or makes me feel like I’m always the one in the wrong.

I also suspect her mother is pushing her to get involved with my family’s business, or at least the money from my second job. It’s manipulative and I feel like I’m being used.

I’m exhausted. I’ve grown to hate her, and I’m angry at myself for letting this toxic dynamic into my life. But the truth is I’m scared of breaking up. She knows my weak spots and I fear she’ll use them against me. I don’t know how to protect myself emotionally or mentally.

1ln9cqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1ln9cqf/showing_up_for_your_partner_when_opening_up_to/,Showing up for your partner when opening up to polyamory,"Hi,

I (F30) am torn about my current situation with my partner (M32), both Bi. We have been together for more than one year and were open from the start. Our openness consisted mostly of him hooking up with other men while traveling, or if we went to play parties together. I explored this openness only by the end of the first year, having a couple of dates with ex-lovers from my past (I struggle with dating apps to meet new people). He was always very supportive of me going out and finding other people, but we've also discussed that while for him hookups are the template, I need connection and prefer to date people.

Fast forward, I started seeing this guy while my partner was away for travels. He was completely aware (actually, it was the guy who asked my partner directly if he could date me, we have all had intimacy together before, in a threesome). Fast a bit forward, my partner came back home to a reality that he wasn't expecting. We had phone calls and he was aware of what I was doing on my dates, that they were really spicy, and even that I was really liking this guy.

He tells me today that I shoud've prepared him better, but I don't know what I could've said that would make it less difficult to him, because my feelings also changed the moment he came back.

My partner had always been the most chill person about everything, including when we talked about polyamory and open relationships. He was so chill about everything that he invited us to start an instagram account to share with others how we worked on things as a couple. From the outside, it did seem like we were perfect for each other and could stand any storm.

Unfortunately, this storm I wasn't prepared for.

Since he arrived, he started feeling jealousy for the first time. He asked me to move slow with the other guy, and atune to his needs. I have been trying, while anything I do triggers him (a phone call, a message, scheduling a date, even if with his permission). I have been working through my NRE and impulsivity by not speaking about him, containing our communication to moments where I am not with my partner, and so on.

The phone call on a Sunday night was a big trigger. My partner was working and my lover and I were texting in another room. My partner had asked him on a date the following week, and my lover was very nervous. I asked if he needed a call, and just told my partner that I was having a call, without saying with whom (which, to be fair, it's my house and I was going to another room to get the call).

Things were becoming so weird and I, for some damned reason, asked if all wanted to meet for dinner to talk. There was a big need for belonging in this that my partner had been sharing with me. Since we all had a threesome together, he felt like he wanted to get back to that dynamic. And the dinner was great: two men talking to each other works! BUT as dinner finished, my partner asked us to go back and have another threesome, which I really didn't want to. That made him angry. I was supposed to stay the night with my lover after that dinner, to catch an early flight (there was an aspect of convenience to staying at his place), so for my partner the thought that I was going to have sex with my lover but didn't want to include him was bad.

After that, I traveled. I was so angry and running on low sleep that I paused things with my lover (I needed a rest, and attending to my relationship is now feeling more like a demand than love). Got back, and spent another sleepless night speaking with my partner.

It felt like we had reached a point of alignement with polyamory, boundaries and moving forward. I told him about pausing things and shared that it wasn't coming without hurt, and he told me a few times to go and repair things with my lover, because he also wanted to try to make polyamory work.

I went to a coffee place the next day to wait for a friend and had a call with my lover. Explained about my new boundaries and context for polyamory, and also which dates I had agreed with my partner that we could connect in person and have a date. It was all going great until I confirmed which date we had chosen to go out together and that I would sleepover. BUT SLEEPOVER HADN'T BEEN TALKED FOR THIS NEXT DATE.

Crazy, we had discussed sleepovers and he was ok with that. Plus my lover and I never had a date without a sleepover, so it didn't feel out of the ordinary (I didn't consider the fact that most of our dates happened while he was away).

Anyway, my partner panicked, asked me not to have a sleepover, and told me many times that we had just had a big talk and fight and he felt like I wasn't making an effort to repair and reconnect, and preferred making plans with my lover than with him. He was also in pain that I proposed a sleepover because it feels very intimate to him (sometimes he said the sleeping was intimate, others it was the idea of us having sex. I understand both, but the us having sex is something that can happen with or without sleep, so I tried to ask him what was the real cause of pain, but he couldn't understand).

My partner is in deep pain right now, and I really don't know how to show up to him. He is absolutely right that I prioritised making plans with my lover, I have a huge desire for him and am in a very early stage of ""in love,"" plus with him I do need to make plans in advance, and with my partner we already live together.

I feel completely displaced on how to behave and show up. He is asking me for repair, intimacy and connection, which I have been giving him as much as possible, but anything else I say or do seems to upset him. And because this is a place of anonymous truth, I want to express that I feel conditioned about all this. My feeling is that I need to only give him that but excel at it IN ORDER to keep seeing my other lover, who is also going through weird emotions, who was also ""falling for me"" and now is holding to these feelings and ""what he can get from me"" (he is a mature adult with other polyamorous lovers, so I am not concerned that he is suffering at home every night, but I still feel a level of protection for his feelings too).

With honest and hard opinion, how can I show up to my partner's needs? I feel like the more I see him in pain (that I am causing) the harder it is to be with him and nurture him (like being nurtured by the vilain), and of course it comes without intention but almost impossible to forget that my lover and I share a connection that, through all this, is still ""a clean one,"" so when I think about being with him, even if for a couple hours, I feel good, while with my partner I feel emotions that right now I can't name.

My partner really wants polyamory too, he knows that he will want that in the future and that going through this now is essential, but it's also breaking my heart and breaking us apart. We also agreed on many boundaries and expressed and carved guidelines that seemed very beautiful and fair.

He also craves intimacy and repair, which I don't know so well how to show up to. I know he mentions sex vs. me having sex with my lover to be one of the aspects, but we also know that our sex life isn't good (at all, we both agreed months ago that our sexual chemistry is just not aligned at all, and for us sex was agreed as a scheduled play date where we kinda try new things, but it's always soft vanilla stuff). Anyway, feel free to rain criticism or good insights, because I really want to fix this, but I feel like running away, shutting down, and go to very dark places right now.",1,1751184348.0,nonmonogamy,1,1.0,False
1ln9chc,https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/comments/1ln9chc/feeling_emotionally_attached_to_a_name_thats_not/,Feeling emotionally attached to a name that’s not yours?,"Hi! So I (F21) am American with a Mexican name most people here have never heard. Which means that when I go to coffee shops or order food, I just give the barista a fake name to make their job and my life easier. 

Last year I started using the name “Millie” at coffee shops and restraunts. I don’t know any one of that name, nor have I ever before, so it’s not like I have fond memories of a person with that name. I heard it on a character on a show and thought it would be a good name to use for ordering food, since I don’t hear it that much anymore but it’s a name that everyone knows.

That’s all I started using it for. Then I started using it for all my usernames on different social medias.  And now I’ve started liking it as a name for myself, getting attached to it, identifying with it and identifying less with my real name?? sometimes, I walk around my house going “hi, I’m Millie” as if I’m introducing myself to new people. I went to a party, talked to a guy the whole and told him my name was Millie. Never saw him again but it felt natural to me? I get excited when I hear it, I fantasize people calling me “Millie.” My friend who always sees my coffee cups called me “Millie” as a joke and I got really happy? Excited? Idk it felt good. 

I wouldn’t ever legally change my name or socially change it, but has anyone ever experienced this kind of sudden attachment to a name that’s not yours?? I don’t even know what to call it. ",1,1751184319.0,namenerds,1,0.99,False

1ln9bpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeSpotlight/comments/1ln9bpc/after_3_years_of_hunting_for_decent_coffee_in_sf/,"After 3 Years of Hunting for Decent Coffee in SF, I Finally Found the Spot That Made Me Stop Looking","Okay, so I've been on this ridiculous quest to find actually good coffee in San Francisco for way too long. I'm talking spreadsheets, neighborhood maps, the whole nine yards. Most places were either tourist traps charging $8 for burnt espresso or ""artisan"" shops where the baristas treat you like you're interrupting their poetry writing.

# The Outer Sunset Discovery

I stumbled onto Andytown Coffee Roasters pretty randomly while exploring the Outer Sunset. At first, I was skeptical because:

* It's literally in the foggy part of SF where tourists never go
* The place has ""limited seating"" (usually code for ""uncomfortable"")
* Another ""artisan roaster"" (eye roll)

But holy shit was I wrong.

# What Actually Surprised Me

Here's what I noticed after going there pretty much every week for the past two months:

**The Good:**

* Their Snowy Plover drink is legitimately different. Like, I can't even describe it properly, but it's not just another fancy latte with a cute name
* The coffee actually tastes fresh because they roast in small batches (I know, I know, everyone says this, but you can actually taste the difference here)
* Staff doesn't act like they're doing you a favor by taking your order
* It's clean and bright inside, not trying to be some moody hipster cave
* They're an actual bakery too, so the pastries aren't those sad, stale things from yesterday

**The Weird:**

* Limited seating is actually a feature, not a bug. No laptop campers monopolizing tables for 6 hours
* Being in Outer Sunset means it's mostly locals, which gives it this genuine neighborhood vibe you don't get downtown
* The minimalist design means they're focused on the coffee, not Instagram backgrounds

**The Not-So-Great:**

* Yeah, you might have to wait for a seat
* It's not convenient if you're not already on the west side
* If you're looking for 47 syrup options and whipped cream mountains, this ain't it

# Real Talk - Who This Is Actually For

After way too many visits, here's my honest take:

**You'll love this place if:**

* You're tired of paying $7 for garbage coffee
* You appreciate when businesses actually give a damn about their product
* You want coffee that tastes like coffee, not a candy bar
* You're cool with a quick in-and-out experience vs camping out all day

**Skip it if:**

* You need to park your laptop somewhere for 4 hours
* You want 20 different frappuccino variations
* You can't handle even minor inconveniences for better quality
* You think Starbucks is the pinnacle of coffee excellence

# The Pattern I Keep Seeing

Here's the thing - I've noticed that the best coffee spots in SF all have similar traits:

1. They're in random neighborhoods, not tourist areas
2. They focus on doing one thing really well
3. The locals actually go there regularly
4. They don't try to be everything to everyone

Andytown hits all of these, which is probably why it's become this ""beloved neighborhood spot"" that people keep quiet about.

# My Weird Coffee Tracking Results

Because I'm a data nerd, I actually tracked my coffee experiences. Out of 37 different shops I tried:

* 5 were genuinely good
* 12 were acceptable
* 20 were straight-up disappointing

Andytown is solidly in that top 5, and honestly might be #1 for consistency.

# Practical Stuff Nobody Mentions

If you're thinking of checking it out:

* Go mid-morning or mid-afternoon to avoid rushes
* Try the Snowy Plover first, even if you usually get regular coffee
* Bring cash (small businesses, you know)
* Don't expect to set up your mobile office there
* The Outer Sunset location is the OG one

# Why I'm Even Writing This

Look, I spent literally years and probably thousands of dollars trying to find decent coffee in this city. Most of what I found was overpriced disappointment.

Finding a place that actually delivers on the basics - good coffee, fresh food, friendly service, clean space - shouldn't be this hard. But it is.

So if this saves even one person from wasting their money on another burnt, overpriced latte from a place that doesn't care, worth it.

And because I went full nerd on this whole coffee hunt thing, I found this [directory listing](https://addictedcoffeebar.com/coffee-shop/andytown-coffee-roasters-lawton-san-francisco/) that actually captures what makes this place different. No fluff, just the actual details that matter.

**Edit:** Yes, I know I sound obsessed. Yes, I probably am. No, I don't work there or know anyone who does. I just really like good coffee and got tired of bad recommendations.

**Edit 2:** For those asking about parking - it's street parking in Outer Sunset. Not terrible, but not great either. Consider it part of the pilgrimage.

**Edit 3:** RIP my inbox. Apparently I'm not the only coffee-obsessed weirdo in SF.",1,1751184234.0,CoffeeSpotlight,0,1.0,False

Lily Lark was shocked. “Have you finally come around?”



Aqua Chronos was not done speaking, but the noise outside ruined her mood.



At that point, John Frank and Will Lane must be throwing a celebration for Samara Queen.



Aqua walked out of the washroom and wanted to head to the president’s office to hand in her resignation letter.

Everyone in the room heard her.



“No need. Have fun.”

“Boo, I’ll call you once I’ve booked my plane ticket.”



Lily Lark was shocked. “Have you finally come around?”



Aqua Chronos was not done speaking, but the noise outside ruined her mood.



At that point, John Frank and Will Lane must be throwing a celebration for Samara Queen.



Aqua walked out of the washroom and wanted to head to the president’s office to hand in her resignation letter.



But Samara saw Aqua and beckoned her over. She spoke cutely and sweetly, “Aqua, are you leaving alone again? Come over and have some fun with us!”



Everyone in the room heard her.



“No need. Have fun.”



“Huh?” Samara saw an opportunity and put on a regretful expression. “Aqua, I know that you still blame me for stealing your project…”



Aqua sneered in her heart.



She had worked on that project for three years. Just as success was within reach, John and Will had forced her to give it to Samara!



She was the one being mistreated. Why was Samara pulling out the pitiful act instead?



But since there were so many people around, she did not want to argue with Samara.



But Samara still chased after her and gave her a hot cup of coffee.



“Thank you, but I don’t want it now.”



Samara popped open the lid and offered the cup to Aqua again, who did not notice and just raised her hands to push the cup away.



It led to the burning hot coffee splashing all over Samara.



“Hot!”



When John walked out of the CEO’s office, he saw this.



Behind him was Will, along with Aqua and Samara’s superior.



John and Will had been having a pleasant chat, but after hearing Samara’s cry of pain, they ran over at the same time.



The back of Samara’s hand had turned red, and the front of her shirt was also wet.



She bit her lip stubbornly and refused to cry. The two men exchanged a glance before turning to Aqua.



John frowned and asked, “Didn’t I give you another project? Why did you have to treat Samara like a punching bag?”



He removed his jacket and draped it across Samara’s shoulder, then took out a silk handkerchief to wipe away the coffee stains on her shirt.



John was a neat freak. He never allowed anyone to touch his shirt, aside from Aqua.



But at the moment, not only had he given his jacket to Samara, but he had even wiped away the tea stains for her.



When he spoke with Samara, John was always gentle, but when he looked at Aqua, he was cold to her.



Will also held Samara’s hand and blew gently on the red part. He would occasionally ask her whether it hurt.



The two men managed to make Samara smile, but out of a sense of courtesy, she shook her head. “It’s enough. Don’t kick up a fuss over nothing. Aqua just accidentally spilled coffee on me. She wasn’t intentionally trying to hurt me.



“Aqua is really nice to me. You misunderstood.”



At that, John huffed and gave Aqua the stink eye. “If she’s really treating you well, why are you the one hurt, not her?”



Aqua could feel some of the spilled coffee sliding into her shirt from where she had raised her hands just now.



But she bit down on her lip and tried her best to keep her cool.



She saw enough, and she had enough.



Such things just kept happening recently.



But Will noticed it. “Samara is the one hurt, and you’re angry?”



Aqua sucked in a deep breath and turned around.



She no longer wanted to defend herself.



So, she ran into the washroom, turned on the faucet, and let the water run down on the itching burn on her arm.



When she looked up, she found that her tears had already slid down her chin. She wiped away the fogged mirror.



Her haggard reflection in the mirror made her feel as if she was looking at an alternate reflection of herself.



When she was eight, her parents got divorced, and she was sent to live with the Franks.



Over there, she got to know John, who was her senior by ten years, and Will, who was her senior by three years.



Since her parents were good friends with John’s parents, John’s parents treated her well. They loved her as if she were their daughter.



They went through the entirety of their childhood together. They grew from ignorant children to young but still immature adults.



These two people were part of the many beautiful memories she had as a girl.



At that time, she had adored the older John. He was level-headed and regal. He was the dream of girls.



As for Will, he fell in love with her at first sight and always asked after her. He stuck by her side like a shadow.



When she was twenty-two years old, she had left to study abroad. But they came over to find her and begged her to go back after just one year.



Will’s presence was not a surprise, but John, to whom she had a crush on, also came.



Will had gone down on one knee to propose to her, and John became jealous, too. He put a rose on her bedside table.



They said that they had had enough of missing her. If she did not go back, they were going to move out of the country to live with her.



At that time, John had already inherited the family business, and Will became his assistant.



When these two men begged her to go back, she felt her resolve waver.



She had to admit that she loved them before.



All of the feelings she had when she was a young girl had been written into a diary with a lock whenever she was free at midnight. She had never said it to anyone, though.



They said that they needed her for the company’s development. Since it was hard to turn down such a sincere offer, she agreed to it.



After she returned, she rejected an executive’s position and started from the bottom level to get used to the business before finally becoming the ace salesperson.



She wanted to use her own abilities to help John and Will out of gratitude for their friendship.



But later, Samara arrived.



Samara was originally an intern working in production. One time, she was coerced into drinking during a social gathering. Aqua saw her then and thought that her watery eyes were so full of life that they could practically speak.



She stood up and drank for her.



From then on, whenever she went out for social gatherings, Samara followed her.



Out of the principle of loving everything about and around her, John ordered Will, who was in charge of Aqua, to bring her along too.



She was also invited to the family gatherings John threw.



Soon, she made it to the upper-class society like a fish in water.



But gradually, John became colder toward Aqua, and Will’s attention was no longer solely on Aqua.



But that was fine.



She was going to leave, anyway.



It would be best for her to forget about her unrequited love.



Chapter 2 Decluttering



After Aqua returned to the hotel, she turned on her laptop and started filling out a registration form.



Aqua had intended to finish her master’s and pass the bar exam. However, her plan was ruined when John and Will arrived.



Even though three years had passed since then, it was still not too late for her.



After she finished registering for the master’s and sent a screenshot to Lily, she immediately sent a list of books to her.



“Come on. Let’s study together.”



She studied until midnight and felt tired. After lying down on the bed, she checked her phone, only to find that she had a few missed calls.



All of them were from Samara.



She did not call her back. Instead, she went to Instagram.



Someone had tagged her.



Three hours ago, Samara uploaded a post with some text and nine pictures. \[Have you had coffee today?\]



At the center of the nine pictures was her, smiling. John’s jacket was on her shoulders, and she was surrounded by a group of actors.



A multitude of people liked her post.

- „AI is obviously the next big thing  -  I didn‘t even know that this kind of tech exist“

- expanding services like „Apple Connect +“ with Globalstar. Sat Connect data and cell packages (Short on Tmobile!)
- buying a new company for „not-organic-growth“

She wore a dress that sparkled like a fairy on speed and a smile that tickled awake long-lost memories. Her voice was soft as a baked apple,

“I need your help, Mr. Schnattergrimm.”

That really was my name. My father was a tale-folk, my mother a stubborn social worker from the Gloomwood. I was born with eyes that caught lies like flypaper and a moral compass that mostly spun in circles.

“What exactly have you lost?” I asked.

She hesitated, then whispered: “My unicorn. It… snorts.”

I blinked. “Pardon?”

“It snorts. And when a unicorn snorts, it’s either afraid. Or has hay fever. Or both.”

So off we went — she in high-heeled shoes of hope, me in melancholically squeaky detective boots — through the alleys of Sparkle City. Past lamp-post dreamers, shadow-shufflers, and an old oracle who only spoke in transit schedules.

The forest was where it always is when you don’t need it — behind the third-best kebab shop and beneath a former disco. We found the unicorn near the old Glimmer Mill. It was a majestic dust-horse, no Wi-Fi though and eyes that had seen through more nonsense than most auditors.

“It was the goblin,” she said. “He threatened it. With artificial sweeteners and unopened mail.”

We found the goblin quickly — like all his kind, he was small, cowardly, and naturally sarcastic. We didn’t talk much. I showed him my license — a notarized moral club made of oak-heartwood — and he slinked away under the nearest mailbox.

The unicorn stopped snorting. She stroked it like she had never stopped believing.

1ln8zll,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ln8zll/no_one_stopped_me_ethbelgrade_hackathon/,No One Stopped Me (ETHBelgrade Hackathon),"I went all the way to ETHBelgrade for my first hackathon. I didn't ship a dApp. I don't code.  I learned to program in LISP at university, which has given me a phobia of unclosed parentheticals but not much in the way of practical relevance.

For reasons that I don't think I can adequately explain, I decided that I wanted to take part in a hackathon *anyway*. I figured I'd spend 48 hours writing weird, Ethereum-aligned fiction. I even created KPIs:

* One completed story I was proud of
* One person telling me that they liked it
* One moment where I felt like I belonged.

I submitted a Taikai application that made my plan extremely clear. Four days later, I was accepted, along with a flight from ETHPrague and the promise of free food during the build. I took this to mean they understood and approved of my plan.

This was my first mistake.

https://preview.redd.it/k046l94rkt9f1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51d38dac12e1a068c6cddea6762eac633547df3e

I spent most of the two days and nights surrounded by unnervingly clever young men and women working in intense little teams, competing for €60,000 in bounties. I didn't want a bounty. I just wanted to finish something that I could share; partly for professional pride, mostly because I'd staked 0.05 ETH for a wristband and a place at the table, which would only be returned if I submitted a valid project. 

*Valid* was doing a lot of heavy lifting, here.

I wrote directly into a GitHub repository, every thought committed in real-time to prove that the stories were conceived and written during the event. I lived on the (surprisingly good) conference buffet.

I stayed at the venue until midnight the first night and got up again at 4am; my anxiety-driven insomnia finally useful.

I challenged myself to include the Hackathon bounty givers, tagging them on my project notes. No one noticed. Still, I had great fun tucking a story into iExec code templates about a guy writing a heartbroken letter to his ex, passively-aggressively formatted as software. I called it *Breakup as a Service*. I spent a ludicrous amount of time formatting the code to look just right, even though it didn't do anything.

Another was an intentionally ridiculous letter written by a Hackathon participant who's absolutely certain that cleaning whiteboards and offering positive energy makes them integral to a team that hasn't noticed them.

>To: The Belgrade Judging Committee  
Subject: Prize Distribution Appeal  
I am submitting this formal appeal to be retroactively included as a member of Team *Rebase And Chill*. While I was not listed as an official team member, I am assuming that the omission was administrative, not intentional.

It was very meta. But to complete the hackathon, I didn't just need to submit a project; I needed to present a five-minute pitch of my product. My pitch, I decided, would be to read this story aloud. I've done a lot of readings and I was pretty sure the story would take about four minutes, leaving me one minute to introduce myself and explain what I was doing. If I spoke quickly, I might even get ten seconds on the importance of fiction in tech. But this is shoved into the pile of things to worry about after I've submitted my project.

By the evening of the second day, the other teams were in tense discussions to get their apps working and filming polished demo videos in odd corners of the Sava Centar.

I created a pretty PDF of five stories that I decided were complete, another word doing some very heavy lifting, and wasted two hours making a pretty cover. At the last minute, I included a page of completely pointless project metrics.

* Stories finished: 5
* Words written: \~9,000
* Useful words extracted: 2,607
* Existential crises: 2.5
* Coffee: insufficient
* Steps (mostly pacing around the Sava Centar): 23,248
* Meaningful glances from judges: 3 (estimated, unreliable)
* GitHub commits: 71
* Commits containing profanity: 3
* Hackathon backers mentioned: 5/9

That night, I discovered that the demo video wasn't optional: it was a requirement for getting my stake back. I retreated to my accommodation, sleep-deprived and muttering. After a few hours of fitful rest, I made a loom video of the PDF with a voice-over that sounded like I was slowly disintegrating.

I submitted it with fifteen minutes to spare.

This was about the time that Taikai crashed, which I'm choosing to believe wasn't personal. It sounded like the conference center was chaos so I stayed in my room. I was supposed to pitch this thing, like a real product. I needed an introductory statement. I needed to rehearse reading the story. I probably should've made PowerPoint slides but there was definitely no time for that. Somehow, I had to explain my art to a crowd who were expecting to check if my code would compile.

https://preview.redd.it/cq4yxmn3lt9f1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8818ce118cc7c880c001bca90b5501af4034186a

The easy first step was to practice my story so that I would know how long it took to read. Before I began, I glanced at the official Discord channel. My heart sank. The pitch sessions would start an hour after submission deadline, it said. I’d already blown half of that on spiraling. Someone posted a spreadsheet with all the teams. I was 7th. I grabbed my stuff and ran to the Sava Centar, arriving at five past.

The spreadsheet showed team number three as “in the room”, which I took to mean pitching, giving me twenty glorious minutes to grab a pastry and cobble together an intro. But then the status line vanished. I abandoned the coffee queue and marched up to the desk in front of the conference hall to ask how I’d know when it was me.

[Photo by SimonaSerban.eth](https://preview.redd.it/w8uoywb6lt9f1.jpg?width=482&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29582e2f927da349bae978fa91de390b39d5ae97)

They scanned the spreadsheet and told me I should just go in and wait  my turn. Right. No pastry. No coffee. No prep. But at least I’d get to  hear other people’s pitches and work out what I was supposedly meant to  be doing.

I walked in to find clusters of people all over the  room. Some were sitting at small tables facing the wall. A small crowd  huddled near the stage; I assumed they were the team currently pitching. Someone tapped me on the shoulder and whispered the format: I had five minutes to speak. She’d wave when my time was up so that we could have three  minutes for the Q&A. I nodded and asked in a whisper where I should  sit. She pointed to a table where two men were engrossed in their  laptops. There wasn’t much room but I sat down across from them, pulling  out my notebook. I settled in. I smiled politely at the two men across  from me. One, a friendly looking man with a thick beard, smiled back.  The other never looked up. I leafed through my scribbled pages and began  rooting around in my pockets for my pen.

About ninety seconds passed before the friendly one with the beard looked at me and spoke at full volume, as if we weren’t in a room full of people nervously  pitching their projects.

“So,” he said.

*Rude*, I thought.

A brief pause and he continued. “Do you want to start?”

I blinked and then froze in horror. “Is this my pitch session?”

Both stared at me and nodded. Yes. Yes, it was.

I  opened my mouth and closed it again, hoping the floor might swallow me  whole. I mumbled something incoherent about fiction before closing my  mouth again firmly. FriendlyBeardGuy asked me if I had a Github repo. I  did! I spelled out t-w-e-l-v-e-m-e-a-t-b-a-l-l-s and they each pulled up my repository on their laptops and began rummaging through my files. That flicker of relief vanished: This was exactly the wrong place to start.

I tried to explain that the repo was full of stories. They looked up from their laptops and then down again.

Mr Serious broke the silence. “So you have no code?”

A tiny shake of my head.

“Is there an app?”

Another tiny shake.

He  glanced at his screen, as if retracing the steps that had led him here.  He looked like a man who’d arrived at the wrong meeting, the wrong  building, possibly the wrong profession, but was too polite to say “What  the hell is this?”

I stared at the floor as I explained that I was going to read them a story.

Heavy silence, as if I were a cat offering them a dead bird.

I  fumbled for my phone to find the file, which I had not yet actually ever read aloud. I tripped over the title like it was a loose paving  stone. Both men stared at my repo as if a user manual might appear.

I took a deep breath and read the next line, where the story was  addressed to the judging committee. FriendlyBeardGuy looked up, puzzled. Was I talking to him?

At least he was listening. I kept going, half hoping the floor would reconsider.

As  I got to the bit about the participant wiping the whiteboard that no  one had used, Mr Serious glitched, his face shifting into something that  might have been a smile. That tiny spark was all I needed. I kept  reading, my confidence growing. The woman from the start walked over,  hovering behind the men. She held out a flat hand, lifting it up and  down. I stopped, stared at her in confusion. She made a wavey motion.

Oh *shit.*  I was reading competently, finally, which meant that I was using a public reading voice for an easily-distractable audience. My mother would have called it my outdoor voice;  meanwhile other people were in there doing their own  pitches, probably wondering what the hell was wrong with me. “I’m so, so sorry,” I said. “I didn’t mean to be so loud.”

“No, no,” she said, looking almost as confused as my judges. “Just your five minutes are up.”

*That’s it*?  I looked at her and then at the men. This was the signal for the three-minute Q&A, a nightmare from which I might never recover.  Maybe one of the questions would be “How does the story end?”

FriendlyBeardGuy  smiled at me the way you smile at someone having a psychotic episode  and said, “Don’t worry” in a soothing voice. I took this to mean I  should keep reading. Somehow, I made it to the end of the story. “Thank  you,” I said in a gravelly voice.

Both of them stared at the middle distance without a word. I could only have made this worse by offering to tell the whole story in interpretive dance. The floor  beneath me remained disappointingly solid.

Mr Serious lifted his laptop and turned it towards me, showing me my repo. “I found code,” he said.

*Breakup as a Service*  glowed on the screen. I gritted my teeth and attempted to speak through  them. “It’s a story about a guy who is trying to use code templates to  write software but he’s lying to himself and really just writing to his  ex-girlfriend.”

This did not help to clear things up.

[Excerpt from Breakup as a Service](https://preview.redd.it/gjmnvjeclt9f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=38404e4ac88a82e1779a487b449da2565a37a9f5)

He scrolled through the file. “So, this won’t run?”

“No.”  Right now, this was the only thing that I was confident on. “It’s pure  vibe coding. I wrote it with AI. I showed it to a dev friend to check  the syntax but he refused.”

FriendlyBeardGuy nodded in sympathy with my unknown friend.

”There’s  a PDF,” I said. “Of all the stories. That’s probably easier to read  than the Github repo.” They both nodded pleasantly. They were never  going to read the PDF.

”That was a very enjoyable story to hear,” said FriendlyBeardGuy. We were finished.

I stumbled out and started laughing. Someone turned to stare, but after the last ten minutes, it barely even registered.

It was over. At least for me.

Mr Serious was probably still staring at my code, hoping it would eventually explain itself.

In that regard, he and I had a lot in common.

I asked her why she ignored the no pets sign? She ignores me. I asked her did you miss the no pets sign? She immediately says I think you should stop harassing me. 

All I was doing was asking why she ignored the no pets sign. This lady played the victim and called me an asshole.

Another patron steps up for her and the dude says why's it an issue? Who cares? Tells me don't be an asshole and drop it. 

I wave the guy off, tell him I care, and I don't like dogs. I say it's not hard to not bring your dog to a coffee shop that doesn't allow dogs. 

By that point it's my time to order, I complained to the employee who didn't seem interested in enforcing anything. The owner left on her own. AITA?

Since it’s 3am and my daughter is keeping me awake, I just went to make some coffee and thought I might ask this here as I attempt to wake up, but I am not quite there yet. Has anyone else experienced this? ➡️ I’ve been having an issue with my machine where every few days, I push the coffee button and it either does nothing and shows red, does the heating up light and then red, or just goes straight to red. The first thing I did was google and I’ve tried all the normal things. This happens after cleaning and/or descaling, after not using, after just using, there’s no rhyme or reason. The only things that help - and I do this exact order so I have no way to know which is the real fix - is that I unplug the machine for several seconds, plug back in, use hot water and wipe everything down, spin the little spinner manually and click the latch one time to make sure it’s released, and then put a new pod in and it’s fine. The not fine part is that I have no way of knowing when it’s going to play hard to get, so by this time, I’ve already wasted a pod. As it happens every few days, it’s gotten to be a lot of wasted pods. I tried to reuse one once and it was too full of grounds, but I’m sure that’s fine for some people. However, I’ve grown accustomed to my bougie nespresso so I would rather not chew it. Anyway, my point is, is this common, am I missing what the problem is, and does it mean my machine is bound for failure? I’ve been using this one for about a year now, having this trouble the whole time, after my first machine broke up with me. Thanks to anyone who has read my 3 am ramble. Extra thanks if you have helpful advice. Please no rude advice, though, cuz like - it’s 3am. Cut me some slack. 😂🤷‍♀️ ",1,1751181945.0,nespresso,1,0.67,False
1ln8qwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cta/comments/1ln8qwf/assaulted_at_a_red_line_station/,Assaulted at a red line station,"At the Loyola Red Line stop today, some lady outside of the station was talking about my body and I didn't care for it so I gave her the bird and told her ""fuck you."" I continued walking into the station to get a coffee from that dunkin' donuts. As I was waiting for my coffee, the lady walked in with a woman who turned out to be her mother. The lady walked up to me telling me that I had no right to say that to her and that I should not have been offended by what she said. 

I kept repeating loudly, ""get away from me, stop bothering me, stop talking to me."" Very loudly and clearly, I said some variation at least ten times. She kept talking and approaching me and her mom told her to keep walking. For what it's worth I'm 47 and she was probably a few years older than me. I am a woman. We are both white.

When her mom told her to keep walking I said to her mother, ""thank you for giving her good advice"" and then I said to the woman, ""please leave me alone, please stop talking to me.""

So the lady decides that she's going to call the cops on me. Yes, really, calling the cops on me because I keep asking her to leave me alone. So of course I pull out my phone and start recording because it's 2025 and when someone is calling the cops on you you have to start filming. 

Well she hated that and told me to quit filming her. I didn't respond to her I just kept filming because we're in a public place and I'm absolutely allowed to. She slapped the phone out of my hand so I grabbed her arm and then I put my other arm around her neck, not in a choke hold or anything but just to pull her to me. I turned her so her back was to me and I was just trying to make sure that she wasn't going to try to hit me again, although she did scratch me pretty good on my other hand. I yelled at her a few times, ""Don't you ever touch me."" Her mom came to break it up. 

The people in the dunkin' donuts were fully unbothered, I'm sure they see this all the time. I texted a friend of mine who I knew was waiting upstairs for the train (I was about to hop on a bus that was still a few minutes away) that I'd been hit by some random lady. By the time she saw the text and came downstairs I'd already left. I had just grabbed my coffee and walked off to catch the bus because staying there seemed like a bad idea. My hand was bleeding, the cut wasn't deep but it was still bleeding pretty good.

My friend called me as I was getting on the bus, and while she was on the phone with me I heard her talking to the woman who was insisting that my friend give my information and her information to this lady. My friend declined and went back upstairs to get her train.

I called the cops when I got home because I was concerned that she was pressing charges and that they were looking for me. I didn't leave any marks on her when I grabbed her but I'm sure she was terrified. The cop showed up like an hour or so later and said that she wasn't pressing charges but I said I wanted to file a report anyway because I'm at that stop a lot and I'm concerned I'm going to run into her again.

Apparently she told the cop that she was concerned about me and that I was having a mental health crisis. I showed him the video where she slapped the phone out of my hand and he said that she was obviously the aggressor and that I seem pretty steady and mentally fine. I showed him my hand, he asked if I wanted an ambulance, I said no thanks.

This was at 10:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning. She was in her '50s, a white woman, her clothes were neat and clean and so was her general appearance. Technically this all happened on CTA property though it doesn't really have to do with the CTA but honestly I haven't fucked with the red line since the '90s as much as I can help it, and now apparently I can't even fuck with red line stations just to get coffee.

**Directory:**   
This smoky backroom, featuring a pool table and fully stocked bar, has served as a retreat on more than one occasion for guests lacking the social wit required for after-dinner conversation. A rather curious game of darts provided the less competitive players a unique opportunity to ponder over its unusual rules.

# Dartboard Game:

**Instructions in Game:**

1. There is a note in the Guest Bedroom which sets you up for your first attempt at this. It states ""I always enjoy your **Mathematical Puzzles** and appreciated that I didn't need to know the **rules of darts** to play your variation.""
2. Note in the Nook, Magnified:

https://preview.redd.it/wl67hle5vi9f1.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2613c49ef7061a3635e3965d934f79d433d0ce5

3. The chalkboards on either side of the dartboard display + - x **÷**, from top to bottom. (and the dartboard starts with the inner ring doing addition and each ring initially represents each of these 4 operations in the same order.)

4. Classroom 2: The wall art teaches the colors and their operations. The homework only addresses the colors and their operations

5. Classroom 7: The homework in this room can be reverse engineered to teach you what the Square, Diamond, and Wavy lines (1, 2, or 3) mean.

**General Rules:**

\-You can select any digit from 1-20 around the outside of the dartboard as your answer.  
\-There are 4 rings, and you perform calculations using the inner ring closest to the bullseye first, and work your way out after each ring is completed.  
\-If you press the incorrect answer, the puzzles will reset, and repeat in exactly the same order.  
\-Each day will have between 2-5 puzzles (1 addition puzzle for Speakeasy)  
\-The 40th solution, which provides a trophy will have 7? puzzles. (need to verify #)  
\-The game gets gradually harder each day and this difficulty doesn't reset.

**Steps to Solve:**

**Step 1.** **Begin** at 0

**Step 2.** **Outer Ring** (After Solution 40 these can appear, and modify the initial values of numbers):  
●● = Double the number below it, and use that new value for all calculations.  
/ = Halve the number below it, and use that new value for all calculations.  
**× =** Do not perform any calculations with this number.

**Step 3. Inner Rings - Starting from the ring closest to bullseye**:  
Full Filled Segment = Use the same number calculated in step 2.  
1/3 Filled Segment = If only a narrow strip down the middle of the segment is filled in with a color, then divide the value by 3.

**1/3 Filled Examples:**  
A ) 3 = 1;  
B ) 9 with 2 dots over it = 6  
C ) 15 with a slash over it = 2.5

**Blue** = Addition = Add all values on this ring  
**Yellow** = Subtraction = Subtract all values on this ring  
**Pink** = Multiplication = Multiply by each value on this ring separately (only on rings 2-4)  
**Purple** = Divide by each value on this ring separately (only on rings 2-4)

\*\*\*Important Note: Eventually, 1 ring can have multiple colors, perform these operations in order of + - x **÷**  
(unless someone can show this works otherwise, I've only seen it once and I had to do - before x to get a valid answer)

**Step 4. Calculate Bullseye** (modify the Step 3 result)  
Only do this calculation if the Bullseye color = same color of the ring you just completed.  
Shapes in the middle of the bullseye are calculated first, then calculate the **surrounding** outer shape.

**Square** = ""Square"" the current result. (8 = 64)  
**Diamond** = Reverse the digits, and keep any decimal place in between the **same 2 numerals** (41 = 14 or 200 = 002 or 8.25 = 52.8)  
**Wavy Lines** = Rounding to the nearest...  
**1 (pair) Wavy Lines** = ...1's place (2.16 = 2 or 37.5 = 38)  
**2 (pairs) Wavy Lines** = ...10's place (-123 = -120 or 65 = 70)  
**3 (pairs) Wavy Lines** = ...100's place (44 = 0 or -150 = -100)

Wavy Lines always round **up** when exactly **halfway** to the next rounded number.  
(as shown in the 2nd example above under Wavy Lines)

**Step 5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for each of the 4 rings of the dartboard.**

**Step 6. Select the final result from the outer ring of numbers.**

**\*\*Prizes\*\*:** Once the puzzles are completed, the Dartboard raises up revealing one of the following:  
2 Keys  
1 Electronic Keycard  
1 Secret Garden Key  
1 Silver Key

# Upgrades:

**Pictures:** [https://imgur.com/a/ixjYHt0](https://imgur.com/a/ixjYHt0)

**-Speak Easy:**  
The dart puzzle has a single, simple solution.

Directory:  
When you walk into a bar and see bootleg jugs and darts, it's easy enough to add two and two together.

\-This Room Contains a note from Cristoph to Bridgette about convincing Kirk Darren to change the room back to Billiard Hall because the Baron is returning from his trip. Denny is willing to pay him in gems for this.

\-""The Mice will Play"" is written on the glass behind the bar, perhaps being the name of the Speakeasy.  
This phrase is also mentioned in a short stanza on the side of the Break Room vending machine.  
It refers to Herbert being the Cat, and the workers being the mice.  
Herbert is also referred to as the Cat in the Garage car seat note.  
[https://www.thehistoryofenglish.com/while-the-cats-away-the-mice-will-play](https://www.thehistoryofenglish.com/while-the-cats-away-the-mice-will-play)

**-Break Room:**  
Calling it a day inside of the break room, gives you a Keycard at the start of the next day.

Directory:  
A dimly lit staff break room equipped with a comfortable lounge area, a coffee snack station, and a collection of billiard games for the staff to ponder over. This cozy space served as a fifteen minute haven for employees seeking a brief escape from their daily tasks.

\-This room contains the Initials of employees with their Scores  
\-Has a false note about admin access  
\-Has a true note about staff contracts being removed from the highest rank.  
(Likely removed from Room 46 after Denny discovered them.)  
\-Has a letter about the 1 month paid leave beginning on Nov 6th  
\-Has a small message on the side of the cigarette machine which mentions ""The Mice Will Play""

**-Pool Hall:**  
Adds Foyer, Great Hall, and Secret Passage to today's drafting pool

Note: there is a wiki article which mentions 2 other versions of the Pool Hall, but there is no evidence online besides this article, that those versions exist in game. (The images for these 2 variations are missing the puzzle piece, and are likely from a pre-release version of the game)

Directory:  
Once a quaint space for amateur gaming, the Billiard Room has been expanded into a full-blown Pool Hall, an after-hours magnet for sharks and hustlers aiming to make a quick buck off an unsuspecting mark. A rather curious game of darts continues to provide the less competitive players a unique opportunity to ponder over its unusual rules.

\-This room has 2 pool tables, and no other visual changes.

\----------------------------------------------

# Misc Room Details:

\-A color assist mode for colorblind players is planned for [patch 1.10](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1569580/view/516336614597722729)

\-Repellent does not work on the Break Room and Speakeasy, and pressing the Room directory key brings up the main directory instead of these specific room listings.

\-The Break Room/Moon Pendant/Coat Check can allow you to get up to 4 Keycards.  
Have a Keycard in the Coat Check, Call it a day in Break Room, next day Get a moon pendant and call it a day in Break Room again, it retains the keycard and Moon Pendant, Call it a day in Break room again, retaining 2 keycards and no moon pendant and go to coat check the next day. This serves no purpose :D

\-The Speakeasy is being used to secretly sell moonshine made from the >!Trading Post's distillery in the side room, which you access by lighting the dynamite.!<

\-The Pool balls on the Table and Shelves mostly match actual pool ball numbers to colors.

Table (in all but the Pool Hall):  
13 is the wrong color, instead of Orange, it's Yellow (subtraction)  
15 is the wrong color, instead of Maroon, it's Blue (addition)

Rack:  
13 and 14 are wrong, but both are Yellow (subtraction)  
2 is the wrong color (green instead of blue)  
10 appears solid blue, but should be striped.  
The Bottom right ball can't be read, but it matches blue striped ball on the table, which is 15.  
The 2nd ball on the first row can't be read, but all striped balls are accounted for except 9 and 11 and traditionally 9 is yellow.  
One ball is missing from this rack, likely 11 (possibly 9).

I’m running into a weird issue with my espresso setup and would love some insights.



I’m using a **Gaggia Classic** (modded with PID) and a **Breville Smart Grinder Pro**. I always grind the same dose – **18g of coffee**, same beans, and same grind size. Normally, I get a good shot in about **20–25 seconds**. But occasionally (like every 4th or 5th shot), the shot runs super fast – around **10 seconds**, way too quick and under-extracted.



Nothing changes in the routine:



* Same beans
* Same grind setting
* Same tamp pressure
* Same basket and machine setup





This inconsistency is frustrating. Could it be static, channeling, grinder retention, or something else I’m missing?



Has anyone experienced something similar with this combo or figured out a consistent fix? I’ve included a photo of the setup if that helps.

1ln8m8z,https://i.redd.it/jaiyfj69ht9f1.jpeg,28F4M: Delhi - Looking for a holistically available whacko for my Potter-head friend!,"This post is born out of insomniac nights, our endless discussions, consuming a lot of coffee, and my good-for-nothing brain cells.

A 28 years old woman with black scrubs,🩺 weak eyes, and a fierce brain is looking for a human, a person, and a man in one! She is a ADHD-CPTSD woman with her sunscreen, eyeliner, and enthusiasm for skincare, makeup, laziness, and more. 

Who are you?
1. Non-threatening towards her presence and existence.
2. Knowledge matters. It truly doesn't matter if you are from medical or non-medical field, she will appreciate someone who is interested in ideas and sharing and gaining knowledge.
3. Sexually-open to unlearning, learning, exploring, and communicating. Someone whose gaze towards her is not inherently sexual. 
4. Collectively have fun and open to new shared experiences and holds her hand while going to activities, experiences, and events that are new for her. 
5. Calm, grounded, and patient.
6. Someone who puts efforts to make her feel seen and heard.
7. Gives her new perspectives and she will reciprocate too.
8. As specified above, she has trauma and trauma can be complicated and complex to understand. She is on the path to learn about herself and how her trauma affects, informs, and shapes her present and you are someone who becomes a fellow non-judgmental co-traveller on this road with her. 
9. You are honest and transparent.
10. From nurturing and caring in conventional and 'weird' ways to developing a space where you both foster critical thinking for each other.
11. Showing up consistently
12. Non-abusive, non-controlling with zero superiority complex.
13. Please be a bit tall!
14. You are open to be vulnerable and emotionally available.
15. Believe in therapy and open to it if and when you needs it or already in therapy
16. You can celebrate, encourage and stay present with her-it can be as mundane as celebrating her for a hair-wash that she was thinking about since weeks!
17. She is working on being kinder towards herself and the world in general. Would appreciate if you are on the similar journey of being kind towards yourself too. 
18. Please don't be a supporter, cheerleader, and a bystander of oppression and oppressive systems.
19. Pens, flowers, art, perfume, food are good gifts for her, thank me later.
20. Not being ableist at all but please have the metaphorical spine. It helps everyone!

I asked her how will you describe herself. She said ""A gentle crybaby who loves cuddles.""
The things that come in my mind for her are intelligent, thoughtful, a potentially amazing doc who I can trust with my loved ones, and have either 36 tabs open in her head or she is immersed in blankness!

Food: She is vegetarian and loves all cucurbits except bitter gourd. Also, if she is affectionate to you she will make ridge-gourd dosas for you and maybe give you tomatoes and brinjal to eat with anything! I know scary right?

Your dietary choices are yours and she is open to person with any kind of dietary choices. Buying good coconuts is a skill that she is fond of so brownie points if you can buy one.

Religion: She is irreligious and oscillates between atheism and agnosticism and would prefer to have someone who shares the similar irreligious values.

Interesting facts about her: She fancies to kiss a lion cub or cubs without getting the wrath of the mother lioness. She loves videos and reels of cats, dogs, and other  animals but you will find her being scared when they come out of screen in real life. She might run away from them or you might find her hiding behind yourself for protecting her life! So although she virtually loves animals, pets and strays can be scary for her.

Her love language: She will fight for you with you if needed. She will celebrate as 'small' as something like brushing your teeth to something like your mundane existence without blinking. From kisses to critical reflections, you can count on her for being supportive and appreciative. She will empathise with you and will really mean when she will ask ""How are you?"" and will genuinely while listening to you with all the attention she can muster up! When she likes talking to you, She will move from one topic of conversation to the other like how a leopard moves: flawlessly. She can also be patient and will listen to you. 
She will make efforts to share quality time and express through physical touches(she might start braiding your hair or bite you).

Having said that she is on journey and you might be one with whom she explores and understands different notes of the music called love!

She might bedazzle your gadgets with stickers or she will give you her art or design a phone cover for you! She is actually going to get better stickers for my gadgets. She has already marked her presence on my gadgets so be ready!

Let me start by saying that I purchased a used Lelit that was just a few years old but I practically changed the valve and the seals, did the descaling and backflushing and cleaned the grinder with the right products.
I use Passalacqua Vesuvio coffee, the best coffee brand in Naples which has a high percentage of robusta (65%) which should give body and cream.  The coffee should have been roasted in June 25 (it reports expiration in June 2027 and Passalacqua indicates 24 months at most) therefore very fresh so I can't explain the absence of cream.

After a few attempts I found a good setup with the coffee coming out in the right quantity and speed, but I'm a little disappointed as I expected a much denser and creamier coffee like in the best bars in Naples.  Instead it is all in all liquid, the sugar should drop slowly but instead it sinks. 

Am I incompetent or do I have too high expectations?

I anticipate the answers: if I grind more finely I have over-extracted coffee or it doesn't come out (now I'm at 2.1 on the ring). I use 17g for a 57mm filter (16-18gr) ",1,1751181327.0,Lelit,2,1.0,False

Let’s start with the cap. It’s got that perfect low-profile fit I really like — not too tight, not too loose. The stitching is clean, and the shape holds really well even after wearing it a bunch of times. I’ve been throwing it on almost daily, and it’s quickly become a go-to piece whether I’m dressing up or just going out for a quick coffee.

The sneakers really surprised me. Straight out of the box, they felt solid, the build is sturdy, and the shape holds up nicely on foot. Super comfortable for long walks, and they bring that extra edge to simple outfits. I’ve already worn them on a few longer days and they still feel great — no pain, no weird pressure points.

Roommates gf is constantly here and I set a boundary,"I (30F) have been living with my housemate (29M) for about 8 months. It’s a very small 2-bed, 2-bath apartment. I’ve lived here for 2 years, and I’m the main leaseholder, I manage all bills and communication with the property manager and own all the appliances and furniture. Because of this, I have the carport and the slightly bigger room. I also pay for the Wi-Fi and streaming services to keep things fair, and we split all other bills 50/50.

We’ve become really close friends since he moved in. We’d usually carve out time once a week to catch up or watch a movie, and I’ve always really valued him as both a friend and housemate. Until recently, I had absolutely no complaints.

Before he moved in, we agreed to always give each other a heads-up if we were having someone over, and to avoid having guests constantly so we could respect each other’s space. It’s a TINY apartment so you can feel when someone else is in the house.

He used to have girls over now and then, but it never interfered with my life at home, so I didn’t mind. But recently, he started seeing someone new, and the three times I’ve met her, he never gave me any notice she was coming over. The first two times he apologised, and the third time, he didn’t say anything at all. All three times she’s stayed until he went to work late the next day, and had roughly 30 min showers each time, and helped herself in the kitchen. All of this happened in the space of about a week.

I went away for 3.5 weeks after that. I came back briefly once and noticed she’d basically moved in. Her shoes at the door, her things in the pantry, her stuff everywhere. I thought, okayyyy, he knows I’m away, whatever. While I was gone, he messaged me saying he missed me in the house and was excited for me to come back. I’d been having a really awful time while away, and he was really supportive throughout, constantly checking in on me. I’d barely slept in that time and just couldn’t wait for a good night’s sleep in my own space again.

On my first night back, I noticed there was no room for my shoes, her stuff has now multiplied everywhere, even in the pantry and kitchen, I was finding her hair in my en suite bathroom (which was odd), my shows were skipped ahead or behind, and my towels were missing from my shelf. I thought, it’s fine it’ll settle once I’m back properly.

That night, he came home and she followed right behind him. No warning again. They said hi, and he tried to make small talk, but I was not in the headspace for guests. I was finally home and wanted to unwind (I was snacking and sprawled on the couch in my pjs). I don’t know this girl, and felt like I’m having to “perform” for a stranger in my space. Normally this wouldn’t be an issue, but everything put together, I was annoyed.

Later when he came into the living area, I joked, “Hey, by the way, I really don’t want a third housemate.” He laughed and said, “What? Nooo way, she has her own place!” and brushed it off. I hoped that was enough to get the message.

I went to bed because I had work early the next day, which is something he knew, but they stayed up talking and laughing loudly until 1 am. It ruined the night I’d been desperately looking forward to, and I was so frustrated I didn’t even want to message him in the moment out of fear I’d say something too harsh.

The next night, I asked if we could catch up. He looked at his phone and said, “Oh, sorry, *** is here, she’s coming up now, I’ve to go down and let her in” That’s when I calmly said how I’d been feeling. I explained that I know things probably changed a bit for them while I was away, but I’m home now and needing space. I said I wasn’t comfortable with her being here everyday, especially when I don’t know her. I brought up how hurt I was that I wasn’t given a heads-up the night I came back, and mentioned how they’d kept me awake. I said that I would love to get to know her, and asked how we can work out a happy medium for the both of us. He completely agreed, apologised, and said he’d already spoken to her about me coming back. He even admitted it was hard adjusting to me being back because they’d gotten used to having the place to themselves. We ended with a hug, and I felt it was properly addressed.

Since that talk, he’s completely withdrawn from me. I’ve given him space, knowing these things can be awkward at first. But now it’s been about 3–4 weeks. He’s stopped chatting with me entirely unless necessary, barely stays at the house, and is just cold.

A few days ago, I went to his work (something we used to do for each other all the time just bringing a coffee or saying hey). I asked if he was okay, and he just said, “Yeah, work’s been crap,” and didn’t open up at all. Usually, he’d give me the full download on every detail of his day. I told him I was worried I’d upset him with our conversation and that I’d love to get to know her properly. I suggested dinner together again and clarified she’s absolutely welcome here. He insisted that he wasn’t mad and admitted again that he’d been in the wrong. Then he told me they’re now looking to move in together, even though it’s been such a short time. I left feeling like we were on okay terms but the weirdness is still there.

Then came the bills. I always send him a screenshot when they come out, and he pays his half. This time, he sent a snappy reply and hasn’t sent anything. It’s been 3 days, which has never happened before. I’m nervous to send a follow up message to remind him.

When I got home today, my lilies, which were on the kitchen island had been moved outside into full sun and died. I’m SO upset. I know she was over today (two of everything on the draining board), and I’m hoping she has allergies and it wasn’t done maliciously, but honestly, I’m not sure I want to know.

What I’m wondering is, have I overreacted or underreacted? Am I the problem? My last housemate was a close friend before she moved in, and that situation turned insanely  toxic (she wanted to pay less rent and have the car spot as her job required her to be away 2 weeks at a time, and I said no, and she got v nasty).

Am I the common denominator here? I’ve never had an issue with housemates in the 8 years I’ve shared with people until the last 2.",2,1751181186.0,AmIOverreacting,10,1.0,False

His mother ( 67F ) thinks she is the most liberal mother in law to exist . She don't have a concept of space or privacy when it comes to my husband . When we discuss something regarding our combined future goals , she wants to have a say in it , leaving me emotionally overwhelmed as my husband don't take a firm side, rather try to establish peace. In all this , the most sane person is my husband's elder sister, she ( 35F ) is a veternary doctor in Italy married to an Italian man ( 39F ) , they both are childfree by choice and living the life of my dreams .

When the rishta was being discussed , I met her for the first time and she was so chill and confident.. she was so different from her family.. my in- laws are pretty much conservation and traditional even when it comes to outfits , my husband don't like short clothes on me much when we are out so I don't wear it but when I met her , she was in a white knee length frilled frock with a warm smile like a breath of fresh air admist all the orthodoxity. BELIEVE ME OR NOT , but when we sat down to talk , she told me in clear words "" see , my mom is a narcissistic, she dont even know it . She was extremely over controlling for my brother Even in his childhood, till his college , she had the say about his fucking hairstyle . He don't stand up for himself coz he is emotionally co- dependent on her "" .. I was the stupid one to not listen to her and thought she must be a typical SIL.Her relationship with her mother is also quite strianed , she didn't even bother getting involved in any wedding functions until required, not coz she was jelous or something but coz she was busy romancing with her husband .. she was soo different from her entire family . Upon inquiring , I got to know- she just sends a part of her salary to her parents every month and don't involve too much with her family , which for me was weird coz I love my parents far too much.

MY Husband Is not a big romantic person and I was totally okay with it until last month , we decided to go on a family vacation in Paris with my SIL and her husband and my in- laws .. Her husband was mad in love with her as if he was proud of show off to the world that she is his world . His fucking entire universe. He would openly kiss her by grabbing her neck infront of my in- laws aka her parents . He literally don't leave a chance to wooe at her or flirt with her shamelessly .. I felt evinous .. where he was going on his knees for the nth time to give her flowers, my husband was trying to order indian food for my MIL . I felt like every Fibre of my being was on flame when I saw them together.. I know it wrong but I can't help it. One incident was a final straw foe me , when we were sitting in a restaurant and my MIL goes "" ap mujhe nani banna h , vese bhi mix babies too cute honge .. indian and Italian genes h .. sundar , goore aur intelligent ( I want to become a grandma sooner , besides indian - italian babies would be so cute , fair and intelligent) , I saw my SIL rolling her eyes and goes "" I told you , I won't have kids "" and her husband immediately steeping for her trying to take her side in his broken hindi . I felt an ache in my heart - this is what I wanted , this is what I dreamt of my entire life .. the ideal relationship that I never got with my own husband .. it can also be coz my husband and I,  both are of dark shade so maybe my MIL was taunting me indirectly . One incident that also shocked me was , during that trip we all have to check out of the hotel before 9 am , so I knocked on their door assuming they were sleeping while everyone was ready to leave , but I find the door open and my SIL was sleeping on her back under the blanket bare naked .. with clothes around on ground- everything was clear .. I was ashamed and embarrassed to walk on them like that , I came out of the room to find my BIL brining the coffee and cookies for her back in The room . All this made me overwhelmed and hyper sensitive coz I don't remember the last time I had a good sex with my husband 

She is so perfect , I won't say she is like my friend .. she is an Introvert so she don't talk much but all those time when I entered this family . She never spoke into my and my husband matters and at time , even took my sides and when my MIL sat us down to gave us the jewelries she bought for both of us , ofc she got much more than me which is fine but she also gave her share to me openly saying "" What would I do wearing gold in italy , it would look good on you "" .

- lesbian with a wife (aka my girlfriend who I call my wife)
- I'm a nonbinary barista stereotype by trade.
- I'm more active on tumblr than any other social media, and most can tell.
- I am your favourite liberal's favourite liberal. Objectively too woke for modern society. If you can think of an issue, assume I've got a liberal stance on it.
- I have 10 cats
- a lot of people tell me their first impressions of me are that I am confident and self assured but what they don't know is that many moons ago on the recommendation of my therapist I started making jokes about being way too smart and/or how amazing I am at something instead of making self deprecating jokes and then accidentally grew an ego. Oops.
- I love writing poetry. I have this vision of writing an anthology of narrative poems based off of one of my own world's from my worldbuilding.
- All of my favourite media are my favourites because of their worldbuilding.
- MASSIVE DROPOUT FAN, brennan lee mulligan my beloved.
- court jester at heart
- as you can probably tell, a yapper
- it's been determined that my fatal flaw is loyalty. I'd let the world burn in favour of helping those I love.

I honestly have high standards for my friendships, so be prepared for that. But I also don't think that I am unreasonable. I don't expect you to be available go talk 24/7 but when we are talking I expect you to put in actual effort and not use chatgpt or whatever ai to talk to me. (Yes, this has happened to me.)

I grabbed a few bags right before the next drop because I couldn’t wait to support what DD’s working on. 

There’s something exciting about seeing someone like DD put together a platform with this much care and vision. The coffees speak for themselves, and it’s clear there’s a serious attention to detail behind it all.

I did miss the brewer subscription for this round, which would’ve been ideal—I’d love to see us get everyone on the same gear so we have a consistent baseline for discussion. Seems like a crucial step in forming a real community around shared experiences. I’m all in for that.

Big respect to DD for building something genuine and fun. I’ve got tons of ideas (varietal tastings, brewer experiments, flavor notes discussions, specific coffee threads etc.) that could take this to the next level. Would love to hear what you all are planning or dreaming up, especially around shared gear or group tastings.

I’m here to support, contribute, and get involved. Looking forward to earning that drop password, connecting with you all, and helping shape what this community becomes.",6,1751179051.0,coffeerotation,0,0.87,False

1ln7zyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Shortytenthirteen86/comments/1ln7zyq/the_things_no_one_said/,the things no one said,"We lived with Uncle Dock in a weathered house that creaked like it was always sighing about something. The paint peeled in strips like sunburnt skin, and the porch sagged under the weight of countless unspoken words. He was the kind of man who didn’t say much, but made a lot of noise with his silences. A veteran. The kind of old guy who had routines you could set your watch to.

.

Every afternoon, he went to the senior center for coffee, dominoes, and flirting with women who could barely hear him. I imagined him there, a grizzled wolf among a flock of aging sheep, whispering sweet nothings into hearing aids and offering stale peppermints. It was a world away from the silence of our house.

One day, I saw him tuck some bills into a small sewing kit behind his chair. It was a floral tin, overflowing with mismatched buttons and tangled threads – an incongruous object amidst his masculine domain. He moved with a furtive quickness, his eyes darting around the room as if expecting to be caught.

He didn’t think I noticed.

I did.

The next day, when he was gone, I cracked it open. The house was filled with the hollow ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall, each tick amplifying the guilt gnawing at my insides.

Forty bucks. Two tens, a twenty. Crisp. Folded. Still warm from his pocket. They seemed to pulse with a silent accusation.

My hands didn’t even shake.

That’s what scared me the most.

He didn’t say anything. Not that night. Not the next day. Not ever. The silence stretched between us, a taut wire humming with unspoken tension.

Just looked at me a little longer when I passed by, like he was scanning a barcode only he could read. His gaze, once distant and unfocused, now held a sharp, assessing quality. I felt exposed, dissected by his eyes.

So I did it again.

And again. The money was like a drug, a temporary fix to the void inside me.

Eventually, he moved the stash. Taped it under the desk drawer like it was some kind of secret mission. He’d used masking tape, thick and yellowed with age, like he’d learned the trick in the war.

I found it in fifteen minutes. The thrill was intoxicating.

Like a game. Like hide and seek, but with real consequences and no one chasing me. It was a twisted form of affection, a perverse dance of cat and mouse where the prize was stolen money and the stakes were something far more valuable.

That silence? It was gasoline. Fueling my recklessness, encouraging me to push the boundaries further and further.

Then came that summer day. Hot enough to make the air hum. The asphalt shimmered, and the cicadas buzzed like electric saws. I biked over to my great-grandmother’s house. No bad intentions—just bored, restless, already carrying sins like pocket lint.

Her car wasn’t there.usually parked in the driveway.

No answer at the door. The screen door was latched, and the curtains were drawn. The house seemed to hold its breath.

I knocked once, twice. “Grandma?” My voice sounded small and uncertain against the oppressive heat.

Nothing.

The devil on my shoulder whispered, *She wouldn’t even know...* His voice was smooth and persuasive, planting seeds of temptation in my already fertile mind.

The bathroom window was never locked. I knew this from childhood, from countless games of hide-and-seek played in the overgrown backyard.

One boost from a lawn chair and I was inside

It smelled like lemon cleaner and mothballs—clean in that ancient, heavy way old people keep their homes. Familiar. Comforting. A smell that evoked memories of Sunday dinners and bedtime stories.

Made me feel worse somehow. The normalcy of it all, the mundane order of her life, amplified my guilt.

I muttered, “Just lookin’. Nothin’ big,” like I was making a deal with the air. Appeasing some unseen force, bargaining for forgiveness before the crime.

Opened one drawer. Rolls of quarters and dimes. Loose change wrapped like tiny little secrets. The clinking of the coins sounded deafening in the silent house.

Then Grandpa’s drawer.

Two sandwich bags of weed. $1,600 in cash. Rubber-banded. Still smelling faintly of his pipe smoke and cedar shavings. It was a time capsule of his life, preserved in the dusty confines of the dresser.

I stared at it a minute. My reflection in the dresser mirror looked calm. Too calm. It was a mask, hiding the turmoil raging beneath the surface. I barely recognized myself.

“Alright,” I whispered, more to myself than anything. “Let’s eat.” A hollow, defiant statement.

I walked out the back door with all of it. The screen door slammed shut behind me, a sharp, decisive sound that echoed in the empty yard.

Didn’t run. Didn’t sneak. Just walked—like it was mine. Emboldened by the act, convinced of my own invincibility.

That night, I handed out hundred-dollar bills like a rapper in a music video. The money felt dirty in my hands, tainted by the theft.

“Yo, where the hell you get this?” Jay asked, eyes wide. He snatched the bill from my hand, examining it with a mixture of disbelief and suspicion.

I shrugged. “Found it.” A careless lie, meant to deflect attention.

He laughed. “You a damn leprechaun now?” He clapped me on the shoulder, but his eyes still held a flicker of uncertainty.

I bought cocaine from a guy who usually wouldn’t even look at kids my age. The transaction was quick and furtive, conducted in the shadows of a back alley.

That little devil on my shoulder? He was doing cartwheels. He was urging me on, reveling in my descent.

Then someone said the words that stopped time.

“Cops were at your grandma’s house.”

My stomach dropped through the floor. Sweat hit cold. The world tilted on its axis. Reality fractured.

I looked at Jay. “Say that again.” My voice was a strained whisper, barely audible.

“They were askin’ around. Not about you, I think. Just... askin’.” He avoided my gaze, sensing the gravity of the situation.

I grabbed my backpack and dipped with a friend. Dumb enough to think movement was safety. We piled into his beat-up Honda Civic and sped away, leaving the music and the laughter behind.

We got pulled over an hour later. Just a tail light. A routine stop that shattered my carefully constructed façade.

I still had the weed. Tucked into the pocket of my jeans, a damning piece of evidence.

Cop tapped on the window. “You boys know your brake’s out?” He spoke with a bored, indifferent tone.

My friend nodded, too fast. “Yessir. Just happened.” voice cracked with anxiety.

He leaned in, nostrils flaring. “You smell that?” His eyes narrowed, assessing us with practiced scrutiny.

Next thing I knew, I was face-down on the hood. Cuffs cold and tight. No questions. No hesitation. The world shrunk to the gritty texture of the car's paint and the metallic tang of fear.

Turns out, they weren’t looking for me. Not then. Not for the break-in. They were just looking for some kids with a busted tail light and the faint scent of weed clinging to their clothes.

That came later—maybe. Maybe never. No one ever asked. No one ever accused. The unspoken accusation hung in the air like a persistent fog.

Not my grandma. She looked at me with a mixture of sadness and disappointment, but never uttered a word of accusation.

Not my uncle. His silence was more deafening than any shouting.

Not even my mom. She just cried.

At dinner the next week, Dock passed me the salt and said, “You know what a man does when he finds a snake in his house?” His eyes were fixed on mine, his gaze unwavering.

I paused. The silence stretched, thick and suffocating. “Kill it?”

“No. He watches it. Waits. Lets it show where it slithered in.” The words were delivered softly, but with a chilling intensity.

That silence again. The air crackled with unspoken meaning.

Heavy as guilt. Cold as steel. It was a warning, a threat, a silent promise of retribution.

The guilt, the shame, had been replaced by a chilling emptiness.

I felt invincible. Untouchable. Like I could get away with anything.

And that's when I became truly dangerous. The thrill of the heist, the adrenaline of the escape, had awakened something dark and twisted within me. The silence had bred a monster.

She’s never been the type to chase the spotlight. Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras—none of that was ever her. She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer—whatever feels right.

I’m childfree by choice. I don’t believe this planet is the best place to bring in innocent life. I value the freedom to travel, stay healthy, save for meaningful experiences, and avoid gambling with my partner’s future for an uncertain one.

I work online and I’m open to relocating if life points me in a new direction.

I’m an atheist, antinatalist, teetotaler, and into fitness and healthy living, though I do enjoy the occasional cheat meal. I earn decently doing what I love and have no debts or EMIs. I want to be more successful than I am now, but I’m not interested in any kind of rat race. I prefer doing things at my own pace with space to breathe, grow, and enjoy life.

I have a dog so friendly she’d probably help a thief carry the loot.  
I love travel, trying new things, and exploring the unknown. I also watch anime and read manhwas occasionally, especially while traveling.  
I’m a solid cook (self declared, but no complaints so far)

🧭 **Lifestyle & Values**  
No smokers please. Occasional drinking is fine.  
Let’s get fit together. I’ll cheer you on and share my whey protein. Apes together strong.  
Finished a six pack challenge recently. They’re visible under good lighting, an empty stomach, and if I don’t breathe for 10 seconds.  
Bonus if you can work from anywhere like me. Mountain WiFi dates, anyone?  
Good things come in small sizes. I come in at 5'2"" (without shoes) but hey, don’t be afraid to wear your heels.

🤝 **Things I’ll Decide With My Partner**  
• Marriage. I’m currently neutral. If it matters to you, I’m open to it. If not, that’s okay too  
• Where to settle  
• Pets. I’m fine with having them or not  
• How often we travel

💬 **Communication Style**  
Texting or meeting in person? Love it.  
Phone calls? Feels like a surprise exam I didn’t study for.

💡 **What I’m Looking For**  
Someone who’s childfree, kind to animals, and values health.  
Age (within reason), religion, caste, language… I don’t have filters for people. Only for coffee.

1ln7tqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1ln7tqi/support_needs_at_the_moment_ill_tell_you/,"Support needs at the moment, I'll tell you everything","Hello everyone,

I am a 37 year old Frenchman. Since 2014, I have smoked cannabis. For a long time, it helped me channel a form of anger and inner discomfort. It soothed me… or so I thought.

In the meantime, I have experienced quite a few ordeals: loss of my partner, of my dog, betrayed trust, without housing, without a job. And each time, I continued to smoke. To “hold”.

But today, 10 years later, I had several terrifying tachycardia attacks, where I really thought I would die. Just writing it hurts. I refused to believe it was because of the cannabis. But the more I smoked, the more I felt trapped in my head, like mental claustrophobia, trapped in my mind. My heart races, anxiety rises... and I finally understand that cannabis makes me sick.

On June 25, I smoked in the night despite the warnings. Around 6 a.m., a violent panic attack. I almost called 15. I was crying non-stop. A friend took me in, he looked after me… and despite everything, I still smoked 2 joints. And then I understood. That was it. My brain was begging me to stop.

On the 26th, after a sleepless night, I slept in the afternoon. In the evening, I woke up and smoked one last “light” joint. He pulverized me. Prisoner of my head, once again. This time I was alone. I said stop.

On the 27th, head to the doctor. She was great. Constants OK, but she gave me:
	• a prescription for Oxazepam (not yet taken)
	• a letter to a cardiologist (check for tachycardia)
	• a letter for psychiatric emergencies, if necessary

Since then, no more cannabis.
June 28 and 29, abstinence. My general condition is unstable, my sleep chaotic, but I ate a little, drank, smoked a cigarette. Tuesday I have an appointment with a social worker to request emergency psychiatric follow-up.

⸻

But now, I feel extremely alone. I need to talk. Some friends tell me “sorry, we don’t understand”. Others turned their backs on me. I don't blame them... but I'm suffering. And I doubt it.

What if it wasn’t just cannabis? Maybe it triggered something deeper. Because even without smoking, sometimes I still feel locked in, as if dissociated, a stranger to myself.

I try to convince myself: I am alive, I am young, I am in good health. But I have this fear in my stomach: fear of dying. I think that's what started it all. And I'm afraid to say the words. Afraid it's real.

I know I need a psychologist. But in the meantime, I'm coming here.
To speak. To feel less alone.
Maybe meet people, exchange ideas, laugh too, why not.
I'm a bit of a geek, a bit of a gamer, I like to chat about anything and everything. Even an outing, a movie, a coffee, a PM… it would be good.

Thank you so much for reading me 🙏

I bought a pre-built Silakka54 clone from AliExpress a good few months ago. I love it. As soon as I got it, I re-flashed the firmware with the firmware available on the GitHub page. I am 99% sure that I reflashed using version 1.1 and I flashed both of the RPi2040's using \_LEFT on the left and \_RIGHT on the right. Linked below.

[silakka54\_vial\_LEFT.uf2](https://github.com/Squalius-cephalus/silakka54/releases/download/v1.1/silakka54_vial_LEFT.uf2)

[silakka54\_vial\_RIGHT.uf2](https://github.com/Squalius-cephalus/silakka54/releases/download/v1.1/silakka54_vial_RIGHT.uf2)

This is all working well and the board is working great. I can plug the USB-C into either RPi and it works.

Also, when I plug into the LEFT RPi I have different layouts and set ups than when I plug into the RIGHT RPi. Apparently this is all normal operation, but it is interesting.   
  
Now when I originally set up stand alone VIAL in Linux I was using the left USB-C connection. I am now using the right USB-C connection though.  
  
Now when I try to use it I get these errors and it just hangs then says Vial is not responding.

1ln7qwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawncare/comments/1ln7qwh/can_i_do_anything_to_restore_this_lawn_other_than/,Can I do anything to restore this lawn other than re-sod?,"Pictures 1 - 4 show what the lawn looks like today. There is SOME St. Augustine in a few areas, but most of the yard either bare spots or covered with a dense and short grass(?) that moved into areas where the St. Augustine died (pic 5)  
  
Is there anything I can do to restore this other than re-sodding? Is it possible to kill of anything that isn't St. Augustine and use something else to promote the St. Augustine growth so that it slowly takes over and restores the lawn? Or is the lawn too far gone for anything like that to work?  
  
  
Here is the background.  
  
I'm in Tampa FL and sodded the lawn in October 2022. Over the course of a few months prior to sodding, I did several rounds of applying glyphosate and removing the dead material afterwards. After the final round, I waited a few weeks before tilling the area and again removed any dead material that was in the yard. I then raked the soil to be even and applied the St. Augustine sod. Pics 9 & 10 are the tilled area and sod in November 2022, one month after being laid down.  
  
Everything was good for around the first year, but I began to have issues with the yard looking thin and developing fungus (pic 5). I'm new to taking care of a lawn so I read as much as possible and applied a variety of fungicides at the recommended rates and intervals. This helped some, but we had above average rainfall in the summer of 2024 and the yard never looked really looked fully dense and healthy.  
  
Around the end of July 2024 a large area started to thin. I didn't know what the problem was and took to long to do anything about it. The area was completely dead after two weeks (pics 7 & 8). I did the coffee can chinch bug test and found around 5 - 7 chinch bugs in each area I tested. I applied chinch bug treatment and the damage didn't spread so I assume I took care of that problem.  
  
This issue is that some sort of dense and short grass (pics 2, 3, 5) has moved into several areas of the yard including the large area that died. It almost looks like St. Augustine, but it grows more dense and not as tall. I also have several dead patches. In the front strip the dead patches are from where oak tree limbs were stored for several weeks after the hurricanes we had in October 2024.
