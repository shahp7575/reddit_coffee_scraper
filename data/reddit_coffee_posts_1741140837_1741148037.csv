1j3uksd,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1j3uksd/flipper_disclosure/,Flipper Disclosure,"Long story short, I just had a home inspection on a house that a flipper bought 6 months ago. The listing states new roof, plumbing, HVAC, and electric. The inspector found that the plumbing under the off grade home was cut off at the galvanized piping and spliced pvc into the home to look like new on initial inspection by a layperson. It is all, ALL, leaking under the house. Some of the caps are just 4” pvc glued into old piping and “capped” with literal foam spray. The cloth wiring, which isn’t supposed to exist at all according to the listing, was cut back to the wall to try to conceal its existence. The outlets have neutral wires running into the ground, which, in Florida at least, is highly illegal and extremely dangerous. The “new insulation” in the attic is literally, no joke, preformed styrofoam boxes like you would find when purchasing a new microwave or coffee pot… literally hundreds of them thrown in the attic over exposed electrical circuits. While I understand I’m lucky to dodge the bullet with my inspection, I’m also extremely pissed to have wasted the money when the flipper knew they didn’t pull permits specifically because they would have had to bring the whole house to code.

1. Why is everyone always mad at each other? Is this just how lawyers bond, or is it an extreme sport in the US?
2. How does everyone barge into opposite-gender washrooms without consequences? Is there a ""lawyer privilege"" we don’t know about?
3. Why does every conversation turn into blackmail or bullying? Do they teach this in law school, or is it a firm-specific perk?
4. Why are the working hours so insane? Are they paid enough, or are they just fueling themselves with arrogance and coffee?
5. How does everyone know where everyone is at all times? 
6. Why do people dramatically wait outside homes and offices instead of knocking?
7. Why does no one ever finish a conversation? Is storming out mid-sentence a company policy, or just a way to assert dominance?
8. Why does everyone drink so much scotch in the middle of the workday? 
9. Why does Harvey act like he's Batman? Is being a corporate lawyer really that intense?

Tina had long since stopped reacting to Todd’s kleptomania.

If it was small enough to carry, Todd would steal it.

Pens. Keys. A single gas station hot dog.

But this? This was new.

Todd trotted toward the counter, something clutched in his tiny paws. He leapt onto the register, dropped it in front of Barry, and sat proudly—waiting for recognition.

Barry tilted his head slightly.

Tina, deadpan: “What’s he got now?”

Barry picked it up. Turned it over.

A Gas ’N’ Go name tag.

Faded. Rusted. The lettering scratched but still legible.

GREG.

Tina’s stomach dropped.

“…Nope.”

Barry, inspecting it, hummed. “Interesting.”

Tina took a step back. “No. No, it isn’t. That’s Greg’s.”

Barry nodded. “Yes.”

Tina clenched her jaw. “Greg doesn’t exist.”

Barry’s smile widened slightly. “And yet, here’s his name tag.”

Tina hated that.

Todd stared at the tag.

Like he was waiting.

Like he had more to say.

And then, with slow, deliberate movements—he tapped it with his paw.

Barry flipped it over.

And for the first time all night, he stopped smiling.


---

-2:00 AM

On the back of the name tag, something was scratched into the metal.

Two words.

HELP ME.

Tina’s throat tightened.

“…Barry.”

Barry ran his thumb over the letters. His expression unreadable.

“This is new.”

Tina pointed aggressively. “WHERE did Todd find that?”

Barry glanced at Todd. “Well?”

Todd simply licked his paw.

Barry nodded. “Of course.”

Tina exhaled through her nose. “Barry. Be serious.”

Barry turned the name tag over again.

The security monitor flickered.

For a single frame—

A man in a Gas ’N’ Go uniform stood behind the counter.

Expression blank.

Staring at the camera.

The nametag on his chest read:

GREG.

Then the screen snapped back to normal.

Tina’s breath hitched.

“…Did you see that?”

Barry took a slow sip of coffee.

“No.”

Tina swore under her breath.

Barry turned to Todd. “Show us.”

Todd flicked his tail.

Then turned toward the supply closet.

The supply closet that wasn’t supposed to exist.


---

-2:30 AM

Tina hesitated at the door.

The Gas ’N’ Go didn’t have a supply closet.

And yet, Todd had led them right to it.

Barry, studying the handle, murmured, “It wasn’t here yesterday.”

Tina crossed her arms. “Then let’s leave it closed.”

Todd chittered.

Tina groaned. “Fine. Open it. See if I care.”

Barry turned the knob.

The door creaked open.

Inside?

A staircase.

Leading down.

Tina stepped back. “Nope.”

Barry, pleased, said, “Fascinating.”

Todd disappeared inside.

Tina gestured wildly. “WHY ARE WE FOLLOWING THE RACCOON.”

Barry stepped inside. “Because he found something.”

Tina hated that she followed.


---

-2:45 AM

At the bottom of the stairs was a hallway.

Old. Dust-covered.

Rows of rusted employee lockers.

Tina whispered, “I don’t like this.”

Barry stopped at one.

It had a nameplate.

GREG.

Tina exhaled sharply. “Nope. No, no, no.”

Barry tried the handle. Locked.

Todd jumped onto the bench.

With deliberate intent, he swiped something toward Barry.

Barry caught it.

A key.

Tina’s stomach twisted. “Todd, I swear to God—”

Barry unlocked the door.

Inside?

A uniform.

Neatly folded. Dusty.

And pinned to it—

Another name tag.

The same words scratched into the back:

HELP ME.

Tina stared. “Nope. Nope. Hate this. Leaving.”

Barry reached inside.

Beneath the uniform was a notebook.

The pages were yellowed, brittle.

The first entry simply read:

> “MY NAME IS GREG. I THINK I’M FORGETTING SOMETHING.”




---

-3:00 AM

Barry flipped through the notebook.

At first, it was normal.

> Day 3: Frank doesn’t seem like the type to chat, but he’s not so bad. Said my name wrong twice, though. Greg, not 'Craig.' Happens all the time.



> Day 10: Morning shift is boring, but night shift? Weird customers. One guy stared at the hot dog roller for ten minutes, then left without buying anything.



> Day 15: Lights flickered real bad today. I think we need new bulbs.



> Day 22: Asked Tina if she’s ever seen the break room. She said “not yet.” Don’t know what that means.



Then—

> Day 35: Time doesn’t work right here.



> Day 40: Frank doesn’t remember me. He just sighs when I say my name.



> Day 42: I tried to leave last night. I don’t think I actually made it outside.



> Day 50: Tried calling someone. Phone rang before I dialed. Didn’t pick up.



> Day 56: A man walked in twice. Same clothes. Same order. Same words. Back-to-back. He didn’t notice.



> Day 60: Something’s wrong.



> Day 63: I saw myself on the security feed. But I was sitting down. I was standing.



> Day 70: I think I’m stuck.



Barry snapped the book shut.

Tina shook her head violently. “NOPE.”

Barry turned to Todd.

Todd flicked his tail.

Then—

He stared past Barry.

Like someone else was there.

Tina froze.

A shadow stretched across the lockers.

Long. Unmoving.

Barry exhaled slowly.

""Ah.""

Tina’s voice was shaking. “Tell me you see that.”

Barry smiled.

""See what?""

The hallway light flickered.

For a single second—

A man stood at the end of the hall.

Wearing a Gas ’N’ Go uniform.

Expression blank.

Staring.

Nametag gleaming in the dim light.

GREG.

Then the lights snapped back—

And he was gone.


---

They locked the door behind them.

The stairs were gone.

No closet. No hallway.

Nothing.

Like it had never existed.

Todd jumped onto the counter, yawned. Unbothered.

Tina, wrapping her hands around her coffee cup: “What do we do with that?”

Barry turned the name tag over in his palm.

The words scratched into the back…

The faint hum of the store lights…

The way the security monitor flickered just slightly…

Barry smiled.

And pinned the name tag back on the Employee of the Month board.

Tina choked. “WHAT—”

Barry adjusted the frame.

""Greg deserves recognition.""

Tina swore. “I HATE THIS JOB.”

The store hummed.

The security monitor flickered.

For just a second-

Greg was on the screen again.

And this time?

He was smiling.",1,1741147347.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

But boy, was I wrong when it comes to espresso. I recently learned from a YouTube video that light roasts are better suited for pour-overs rather than espresso because the brew duration is shorter, and the extraction primarily comes from the outer part of the beans, which consists mostly of acid. With darker roasts, you get a richer flavor profile with more pronounced nuances, even in espresso, as the coffee is more soluble and ideal for shorter brewing times.

I tried a super-dark roast today—it had notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, and a hint of fruit jam. The body and taste were incredibly satisfying and rich. From now on, I plan to use light roasts only for pour-overs or filter coffee.",1,1741147306.0,espresso,2,0.67,False

Imagine your smart assistant, which used to simply respond to your commands, suddenly managing tasks autonomously, working in the shadows while you sip coffee. Welcome to the era of agentic AI, the cutting-edge frontier of artificial intelligence that's more proactive colleague than passive tool.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is betting big on this transformative technology. With CEO Matt Garman declaring agentic AI could be AWS's 'next multibillion business,' they're not exactly keeping their ambitions mellow. Garman describes a future where AI agents do more than assist—they anticipate and act. Alexa+, the latest iteration of Amazon's voice assistant, demonstrates this leap into autonomy. It's like having an AI butler who fetches the paper, pays the bills, and remembers birthdays—all without you asking.

The AI landscape is rapidly evolving, with players like OpenAI and Nvidia mapping new territories. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman hints at AI that might outrank human programmers by the end of the year, while Nvidia's Jensen Huang sees AI as woven into the fabric of every industry—a transformation just beginning.

But here’s the kicker: as AI agents become more adept, are they poised to replace jobs instead of creating them? The gleaming promise of innovation walks hand in hand with potential disruption, making one wonder if AI’s rise is a sunrise or a storm on the horizon.

So, where does this leave us? With AI agents set to upend industries and job markets, will they herald a golden age of efficiency, or are we stepping into a future of AI overlords? 🤖 What's your take—transformative force for good or a tech revolution gone awry?

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic dental procedure that can dramatically transform your smile, leaving you with bright, pearly whites. But after investing time and money into the treatment, many people wonder about their dietary restrictions, particularly when it comes to enjoying their favorite foods like steak. Understanding what you can and cannot eat after teeth whitening is crucial to maintaining those stunning results and protecting your newly whitened teeth.

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

What Happens During Teeth Whitening?

Teeth whitening treatments temporarily make your tooth enamel more porous and sensitive. During the whitening process, the bleaching agents open up the pores in your teeth, making them more vulnerable to staining and potential damage. This increased sensitivity means you'll need to be extra careful about what you eat and drink in the hours and days following the procedure.

Right after your teeth whitening treatment, your teeth are at their most vulnerable. Dentists typically recommend following a **white diet** for the first 48 hours. This means avoiding any foods or drinks that could potentially stain your teeth, including:

- Red meat
- Dark-colored sauces
- Coffee and tea
- Red wine
- Colored fruits and vegetables
- Tobacco products

Why Steak Might Not Be the Best Choice

When it comes to eating steak after teeth whitening, professional dentists generally advise against it, especially during the first 48 hours. Here's why:

1. **Color and Staining Potential**: Steak, particularly red meat, can potentially stain your newly whitened teeth.
2. **Temperature Sensitivity**: Hot steak might cause discomfort due to increased tooth sensitivity.
3. **Potential for Microscopic Staining**: The porous nature of your teeth post-whitening makes them more susceptible to color absorption.

Safe Eating Guidelines After Teeth Whitening

If you're craving protein after your teeth whitening treatment, consider these alternatives:

- White fish
- Chicken breast
- Tofu
- Egg whites
- Cauliflower
- White rice

When Can You Safely Eat Steak?

Most dental professionals recommend waiting at least 48-72 hours before consuming steak or other potentially staining foods. After this initial period, you can gradually reintroduce foods into your diet. However, it's essential to:

- Eat in moderation
- Rinse your mouth with water after eating
- Brush your teeth carefully
- Use a straw when drinking colored beverages

Maintaining Your Teeth Whitening Results

To preserve your bright smile long-term, consider these tips:

1. Practice good oral hygiene
2. Use a whitening toothpaste
3. Avoid excessive consumption of staining foods and drinks

5. Use a straw for beverages that might stain

Potential Risks of Eating Steak Too Soon

Eating steak immediately after teeth whitening can lead to:

- Increased tooth sensitivity
- Potential staining
- Compromised whitening results
- Discomfort while eating

When to Consult Your Dentist

If you experience prolonged sensitivity or have specific dietary concerns, always consult your dental professional. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific treatment and oral health.

Conclusion

While the temptation to enjoy a juicy steak might be strong, patience is key after teeth whitening. By following professional guidelines and being mindful of your diet, you can maintain those stunning, bright white results. Remember that temporary dietary adjustments are a small price to pay for a radiant, confident smile that can last for months with proper care and maintenance.",1,1741146965.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

I’ve never gotten a laser treatment before and had both done last week at the recommendation of my long time esthetician. My skin looks worse than ever, and we’re 7 days out. My skin was 98% clear before I did the treatment, and now I’m worried I’ve ruined it. 

I’ve been following the aftercare instructions religiously, and slathering on SPF every few hours since my desk has a few windows close by, but I barely got the “coffee grounds” they warned me about and instead just got red and swollen. It looks like I have super deep pitted acne and red bumps. Picture don’t do it justice because the bumps are almost flat. 

When I called them about it yesterday, they thought I was having a reaction from the products I was using (which was just my usual cleanser, moisturizer and a Neutrogena Hydroboost SPF). The Neutrogena is the only new product I’m using consistently, but I’ve used it before sporadically a few days at a time on vacation and had no issues so I thought it was fine. They ultimately recommended Hydrocortisone cream, Benadryl  and switching to a different sunscreen. It’s only been a day, but it’s no different. There might be a slight improvement, but I could just be imagining it. 

I just showered and my face feels itchy and hot, but I’ve also been crying so maybe that affected it too. I’m fair skinned, if that matters, and no matter how many things I search online about BBL or Moxi, I can’t find anyone that’s experienced something similar to this. 

I’m devastated. I’m just hoping someone has a similar experience and can tell me it gets better and that I didn’t ruin my skin forever?

I’ll gladly take any recommendations and advice!

I just started last year so I’m not super clear on the relationship between the shop and admin but it’s completely run by students so managers are all our peers. 

We’re trying to be more sustainable by encouraging people to bring reusable cups or use our reusable mugs (for here mugs) rather than our plastic or paper to go cups. 

People sometimes come in asking for cups of water in to go cups. So I asked management if we should charge for the cups. They responded that we should give them our “floor cups.” Floor cups are cups we’ve dropped on the floor or orders that were abandoned (although I usually cross out the order and just use it for the next customer when this happens). Idk how many of the “floor cups” are really dropped but I expressed concerns about using them as we are not allowed to use them to serve customers typically. We keep them under the counter in case baristas want to use them for our own drinks and for other things. 

Later, we discovered that where we live legally requires us to provide free water and water cups. So I figured that was the end of it. But people are continuing to give people water in the floor cups. Maybe IATAH but we get in trouble using these cups for our regular drinks and I’m not sure how giving them out as water cups changes anything??? I did suggest we could have a separate “not dropped but still unusable as serving cups” area for water cups but now everyone is irritated with me and saying I don’t care about the environment. 

Maybe I’m being a worrywart but I get freaked about someone getting ill from something we give them. I’m not a slave to rules, I don’t pin my bangs back on shift, but when it comes to (seemingly) obvious health hazards I try to be mindful.

Depending on the season, it changes colors so dramatically that it feels like a completely different place each time. It stays popular not just with tourists but also with locals who come back again and again. Personally, I love autumn in Nikko when the temples, some of which are UNESCO-listed, are surrounded by fiery red and golden leaves. It’s honestly one of the best places to experience Japan’s fall colors.

**Izu Peninsula** is only 40 minutes from Tokyo Station by train and has some of the best beaches near the city. It’s great for a quick getaway, especially in summer. The water is super clear, and you can swim, snorkel, or just relax on the sand. The seafood here is also really good, and there are lots of hot springs with ocean views. If you want something more scenic, Jogasaki Coast has cool hiking trails along the cliffs with amazing views of the Pacific.

**Kamakura** is often called a mini-Kyoto and has a less crowded bamboo forest that feels like a hidden version of Arashiyama. It’s a great spot if you want both a taste of traditional Japan and some casual, beachy vibes. The coastal side of Kamakura has a bit of a Hawaiian feel, with lots of surfers, relaxed cafes and beachside restaurants. You can try windsurfing, kayaking or just hang out by the ocean with an iced coffee. But watch out for seagulls, they have zero shame when it comes to stealing food. The best part is that you don’t even need a car, everything is walkable from the station.

**Fuji Five Lakes Area** is easily one of the most scenic places in Japan. On a clear day, you can see Mount Fuji’s reflection on the lakes and it’s honestly breathtaking. For active travelers, there’s a ton to do like camping, hiking, boating, and cycling. Lake Kawaguchi is the most accessible and has plenty of cozy cafés with Fuji views, while Lake Motosu, the westernmost one, is actually the lake you see on the 1000 yen bill.

I’ve known him for around 4 years in total. He approached me and we became friends before we got together. He initially approached me for sex but when I declined it gave him some kind of rejection issue as “no girls ever said no he gets what he wants” which lead him to peruse me and we became friends. 

Before I met him I was an escort, prostitute, lady of the night, hooker etc you get my drift. I had OF and other similar sites and I was doing well, I was totally independent and loved the freedom my career choice had given me financially. He knew this as did anyone else that met me as it wasn’t a secret and I’m an open book. He always looked down on girls who did what I do and saw himself as superior to us, wouldn’t dare pay for us, but would fuck us for free if we were giving it. He never directed any insults towards me it was always about other girls but who were the same as me so I also fell into the same category as those other girls in the sex industry, although at the time I was naive and I didn’t see this whereas now looking back it has became very obvious. 

After a year of being friends he confessed he had feelings for me and wanted to peruse a relationship, said my work wasn’t an issue for him and we could be together - I obliged. After about 3 months, he became verbally abusive towards me always about my job. He would call me all the most horrible names you can think of, and threaten me with violence towards me and my family and friends and even my dog. At first I would argue back but as time went on it got worse and I stopped fighting back as much as I could because I didn’t want the fight. Fast forward to about 6 month in, he started with ultimatums. First it was to do with escorting, he stopped me doing partys, then overnights, then working longer than two consecutive days, then to giving me a whole load of hell when I tried to work to the point I was that anxious something was going to happen that I couldn’t work. I had to stop collab shoots with other creators first it was men then also woman became banned. Regular photo shoots I was not allowed to do anymore. I complied with every request. Eventually he gave me the ultimatum of stopping escorting or he would leave me, so I stopped. In return he offered to pay me some money every month so I didn’t loose out and I could still pay my bills, of course I accepted. However, he only payed me for a total of 5 months before he stopped paying me anything completely due to an argument we had while I was on holiday with my best friend. We argued the whole holiday every single day and it felt like he was determined to ruin it for me. Even though he stopped paying me, he said if I go back to work he will leave me so I did not go back to work and I instead stayed with him with a massively decreased income. After stopping work, he then gave me another ultimatum were I had to delete half my content on my OF sites, not promote my online sites anywhere, picked a fight whenever I posted anything on instagram and said I was attention seeking even if it was just a picture of a morning coffee or train tracks etc. 

For months maybe even over a year I stopped posting on my socials, I stopped posting on OF and promoting it anywhere, and he still wasn’t happy he still moaned at me 24/7 calling me a dirty tramp and a prostitute etc and still gave me the same shit and nasty name calling and threats towards me and my family as he did when I was working. He treated me the same so eventually I got sick and started posting again online, doing photo shoots and posting the content and trying to get back into my OF full time. His latest request is that I delete everything posted since my first shoot since starting again and I don’t post anything anymore. Although unwilling, I agreed to stop posting my pictures but I won’t be deleting anything already on there and I will still do photo shoots for content for OF (solo). He disagrees and says this isn’t good enough and won’t listen to my reasoning why. He said if I don’t comply then this is the end of the relationship.

The reason I don’t want to submit to his latest request is because there’s always something, and he’s never happy. First it was my job then shoots then my online stuff then my instagram etc now this and I just think when will it end ? I have already massively changed as a person for this man and he isn’t and never has been happy with me. I’ve lost myself massively and I’m a shell of the human being I once was and I’m now riddled with anxiety. I’m not willing to loose any more of myself to bend over for a man who doesn’t even appreciate it, and it won’t be long until there’s another issue that I have to change. I feel that he knew exactly what I was when he met me, was friends with me for a year and then chose to make me his girlfriend, no one forced him no one lied to him and he made the adult decision on his own so I don’t think it’s fair for him to choose me and also try and change almost everything about me and my character both at the same time, to fit what he thinks I should think or say etc. 

He keeps saying that the relationship is over because I’m leaving him because I’m not doing as I’m told. But it’s my view that he has gave me an ultimatum, I’ve chose the latter and that has resulted in him ending the relationship. He still regularly asks and expects sexual favours from me multiple times every single day, and I’m met with abuse and threats every time I say no. Which is 1 because he has said he is leaving me why would I keep shagging my ex and sucking his dick it’s not my responsibility no more he has ended the relationship, and 2 he continuously tells me I’m a dirty tramp so why would he want to stick hes dick inside a dirty tramp anyway ? And massively because he don’t care about me it’s him and he’s penis hence why I get abuse when I say no but he’s lovely and nice if I was to say yes. 

Someone please tell me AM I THE ASSHOLE HERE ???? ",0,1741145852.0,AITAH,5,0.5,False
1j3tzmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlotterArt/comments/1j3tzmn/my_impressions_of_the_iauto_by_uuna_tek/,My impressions of the IAuto by Uuna Tek,"So I have been searching the market for a plotter for awhile and I was unimpressed with the options.  I liked some of the builds but for my needs I needed auto feed, I like some of the line art but not a heavy user and needed it more for notes, cards of various sorts and occasionally the option to do some line art. I have been agonizing over this for more then a year and had some reservations on the iAuto but the looming tariffs made me pull the trigger.  These are my initial thoughts and findings on the iAuto pen plotter. 

First off,  let me just say that while this review is going to focus most negative aspects of the machine, I am not intending for my thoughts to pressure you that I believe the machine is unusable or poorly designed, rather I think the machine is quite stellar and is very capable in its own right. It fits my needs perfectly and will only evolve to be better in the future.  I think the base platform is ideal for the intended purpose and my comments are extra polish that might have solutions or will be solved in future software updates. I will strive to incorporate the good into some of the suggestions but I see a lot of potential yet such a small team needs to focus on the critical bugs and what sells and address the nice to haves later.  If I can find open source code I might point to it as an example to help.  Furthermore, I think we take for granted many of the products and software that we currently are accustomed to, are built off the backs of giants and lot development time, and people has went into the word processing programs we currently use.  The most popular ones you use might have been in development for 20+ years and are feature rich (they have had their fumbles like clippy). To temper your expectations a bit look at the common printer drivers which are problem we still have in the office today….using the big box printers. Harken back to the cult classic Office space does that ring a bell. Clearly, printing and drivers is something that should have been solved by now.  So this sets up that iAuto is addressing: Solutions must address a multifactorial problem set to be successful. Kudos to the small team for making a product that is performing out of the box with minimal set up. I am hopeful that in this review superusers will enlighten me that there is a solution to my issues as I am nascent user. With that lets get to my impressions.

My biggest complaint is that there is no PDF manual the options for self-support. The blog is very helpful but it only address some of the feature set and the videos are difficult to search and very hard to reference the part you need without the frustrations of reading small text or rewinding several times in a moment of “what did they do?”  The iAuto’s software UI is not unlike an Apple product it is pretty intuitive you can just click around do some test prints and it makes sense for the daily operations. But even for my phone’s UI I am running to the manual or internet every once in a while for help.   The tool tips are informative but I feel expanding some of the documentation would be helpful.  I did see that they recently put out a manual but I am still in need of a more deep dive.  Maybe some other users want to collaborate?? 

What minimum would I like:

1)      Changing the pen holder

2)      Regular PMs like tightening the set screws and cleaning the machine

3)      Clearing Jams

4)      What all the font modification settings do and what are some good starter settings.

5)      Calibration process with the test print

6)      Font creation workflow process how to produce a decent result, I understand for most advanced font creation it might take some time with inkscape.  (Will cover my experience in more detail). 

The ability to Pause / Resume,  OFFSET the pen, Eject the media, Advance the media.  These would have been helpful when I got into a miss aligned pen adventure a few prints back.

Some of the font package are intentionally missing a character like it would be nice to have the characters proceeding and after these problem spots highlighted.  Likely I can just change the wording or rework the draft but in the sense that it was a quote it was impossible to find in some large body of text.   For some fonts I just added the characters them myself which was an amazing feat in the font editing software Uuna Tec provided really felt like a big win but it would be get to get more detailed instructions

It seems that the estimate of total time and elapsed time are incorrect and do need some work based on the g code and movement speed.  It appears that the print speed is just for that segment of the print not the entire gcode files in the queue.  Several sources exist for this this might be of assistance.   [https://github.com/kliment/Printrun/blob/master/printrun/gcoder.py](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun/blob/master/printrun/gcoder.py)

It would be great to know if I have enough time to run that load of laundry or not make some coffee before I switch over to bulk envelops.

One feature I really like is the  tape that the pens write on. That sub surface really makes a difference in the pen inking correctly or not it is a simple fix and impacts the ability and longevity of the pens success on thin paper.  So what might be the problem.  Well the pens alignment with that surface.  If a thin pen is used it can miss this surface. Furthermore if the surface is removed as suggested to prevent issues with envelope printing then it might be reapplied crooked to the x-axis.  This could cause a bump in pen travel.  I am suggesting the tape be wider to solve both of these problems.  Thus alignment could be based off of the lip of the metal straight edge.  This would insure that I do not need to be that accurate in reapplying the tape nor would my thin pen be off set  on the edge of the tape.  My solution for now.... a thick layer of tape around the thin pen barrel not elegant but it works. 

The pen holder itself seems like it could use some engineering.  I think there should be an all in one solution to make a pen holder that easily converts from vertical to a few detents or more customizable angle.  I would like to also suggest this might also help to firm up the support for the pen or make it easier to vary offset of the pen from the holder no matter the  barrel diameter.  Furthermore, I am not sure it needs to be that robust that is a lot of weight to sling around and stop.  It might save some wear on the belts and motor making this part lighter.  I am sure it could accommodate a quick change option and a method to hold itself to the machine and pen. 

Ah this one bit me early in my testing but is something that could happen during your first long run of important docs.  Screen saver / Sleep mode yep kind of makes sense the computer needs to be running but hey it would have been great to know that before I embarked on the first 3 hour run only to have it fail after the lame 10 minute default sleep mode my computer shipped with. Chalk, that up to new user error.

One feature I really like is that we can rotate the areas we work in it help with some of the wonky paper types or sizes.  But this causes two different issues when working with say envelops;  paper creases from bumping the paper loading rollers, and smudges if the ink has not dried.    The paper creases appears to me from the paper bumping into the back roller instead of being directed downward. I think this could be solved with some clever engineering on one of the fins toward the rear of the machine to deflect the paper down slightly.  The paper smudges are a different issue as the envelope I was writing on was rotated I chose gelly roll pen which is not fast drying. This lead to some smudges on the art work and text.  If I would have thought ahead I could have positioned the text to avoid the roller and chose a different pen.   Adding a fan to help dry the ink would have also been helpful, next time.  

A feature that helps with the alignment and adjusting of boxes is the lines you can drag off the side ruler.  This is very helpful guides but I would like to see the ability to toggle on and off snapping the text boxes to these lines. Also the ability to micro adjust these lines would my mouse control is not so great these days a tool tip to remind me where I put it would be helpful too. Another helpful thought would be to have user adjusted shaded margins to remind us that 1cm from the edge and more space at the bottom is an area to avoid. Setting this as a global (adjustable) default would be great. I had a few mistakes when I had text too close to the edge and tore the paper or the machine just could not grip that last little bit.  One side note in iAuto’s latest video you got a hint and a view of some of the new UI which may address this very issue so I will see if that works.  see it over on [you tube](https://youtu.be/cylEQ_spS0Y?si=s789RpvSU7VGvGzT).   

While those alignment tools would be helpful, I have not found a way to shape and micro-adjust my text boxes.  Some times I need to nudge a box over a little bit or I really need to maximize the space so I would like to have a writing area defined in size.  The ability to nudge while the box is selected would be ideal.  Ah also the frame is very difficult for me to click at times I would approach if the areas or handles that we use to select a box could have just a few more pixels added to the boundary.  Another nice feature that would be helpful would be text alignment.  Most is left justify, but what about center or right.

This is a really useful hack I want to share about a copy a paste function there are two.  A program specific copy and paste for area boxes usually accessed when right clicking on an open area you would like to have a new text box. Second is the text cut and paste that can carry across programs.  When I was setting up some font testing pages this function was key to speed through pasting multiple boxes per page then pasting in the text I needed to change inside the text block ex the font I was testing on that page. 

The ability to add mistakes. Sure you can do it yourself or program it into the font but might just be nice to add that feature and how you correct. 

This was a user interface error that I encountered.  When I added a graphic to the lined pages the lines disappeared (that is ok) but when I moved or deleted the graphic the lines did not reappear. 

I did test some drawings on the machine of some line art and well it really depends on the art for a couple of reasons.  It has some issues with verticals as it is moving the paper which can smear ink or damage the paper.  However I did find that it did well if the art was inline with text or did not have to make long vertical or diagonal strokes.  I was happy with some small art works 

Fonts –

I think the best part of this machine is it can be made to emulate your own hand writing which is a powerful option to those who have to write a lot of the same materials.   The good is the options for fonts are diverse just an amazing variety.  They honestly are amazing how well some of these come out of the machine they look glorious.   Some pens make them truly shine (Pilot V10 black pen wow that is a stunner). Consistent, beautiful writing page after page and it is really difficult to tell they are written by machine. 

One thing I struggled with is examples of the machines work.  I could not find or understand what it could do so I created them. I wanted to test fonts and sizes.  I wanted to know what would work and how would it look I really had NO perception of if this was 1) Quality 2) Limitations 3) Pen / ink variations 4) Line thickness.     

Here are the results of all of that testing.  You can see my notes on font and font sizes.  I tried not to change from default in the variation settings.  I did make some mistakes in set up of some of these my apologies.

I only minimally got my feet wet with the font adjustments they are useful and help with the hand written feel.  I hear that the 45 angle pen holder will also help.  But the wonderful things just make me want more.  I want to take the machine to the next level it can do it but I am lacking.  I need a **Font guide** – We need a go to manual on everything fonts and the effect.  What size looks real too small or too big what looks fake (too wide too slanted).  I want suggestions to guide me on the spacing per font and pen type.  Some idea to get me started. 

Font Conversion -  Meh it worked then didn’t then it did work for a bit more then didn’t work again then it worked for a long long time. Finally I got all of the open source fonts converted.  They are wonderful and great examples of how to create some eye catching content.  But, I cannot understand why the software struggled to open the files likely computer or user error IDK.  

Lets, talk about ""Murder font (TM)"" for a bit (ya I am trademarking that it is clever funny).   What is ""murder font (TM)"" you ask well clearly it is when you are SO enthusiastic about creating a font that you just have to this instant sit down with your drawing tablet and stoke out some…characters that is.   Well let me tell you with great enthusiasm and lack of good forethought and knowledge on how to create a font, I created Murder font.  Disheveled, unhinged, and chaotic is the best I can describe it. Murder font for notes while handy, its uses are limited and you don’t want that reputation even through it does kind of resemble your hand writing.   So what happed well a lot of things are at foul play.  My character variation is numerous, my font height, width and slant all over the place also my hand writing has cursive thrown in for fun.  I honestly could not tell while writing these out that I was so far off.  I need some guidance and tools to help me rein this in.  I did discover some font editing tools on [inkscape tutorial](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/creating-custom-fonts.html#:~:text=Open%20the%20typography%20template%20with,the%20font%20to%20change%20it.) that I might just use in conjunction with some SGV fonts to get me closer to my font ambitions but right now I need [more help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rNex959Zbs).

After all of this let me get into what I like about the machine.  It is over built, production ready and solid.  It arrived and I started using it straight away only later to discover the recommend a preventative maintenance after shipping. Part of the reason why I like that it is over built is that any machine that is going to under go the rigors of production use needs to be robust. The repetitive vibration of use is going to loosen belts  and damage the machine. I don’t feel this is going to happen the case and frame help to stiffen the drives and the engineering of the build is really clean. Congrats to the team, I have seen first hand the difficultly of production if you don’t personally lock down your suppliers and have strict quality control over the parts and specs so please, keep this going quality going and your following will grow too. Next, I while I spent a lot of time picking apart the software and some improvements in the end it is quite easy to learn and quite functional for its purpose. I was able it get going very quickly and start plotting within about 30 minutes.  Most of my problems seem to be a me issue rather than the machine issue or a software issue. At the heart of those the machine is capable and fully functional I just want to optimize my experience. I don’t think the learning curve is that steep nor functionally out of anyone’s grasp. If you can “cut” and “paste” text then I think you can learn to use this machine it just takes a few button clicks to get started printing.   Let me know if you have any questions on the machine or software.

1j3tz9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1j3tz9a/i_moved_into_a_new_boarding_housethey_gave_me/,I moved into a NEW BOARDING HOUSE…They gave me STRANGE RULES TO FOLLOW,"I knew something was wrong the moment I stepped into the boarding house.

It wasn’t the air, though it felt heavier than it should have been. It wasn’t the lighting, though the dim yellow bulbs flickered as if struggling to stay awake. It wasn’t even the silence, though it was the kind that pressed against my ears, thick and expectant. No, it was something else—something deeper, something unseen. An unsettling sensation crawled under my skin, cold and unshakable, like the walls themselves were watching, whispering in a language I couldn’t hear. I had walked into a place that didn’t want me there.

The landlady, Mrs. Carter, stood behind the counter, her frail hands folded neatly in front of her. Her face was lined with deep wrinkles, as though time had carved its story into her skin. Her gray eyes—dull, unreadable—rested on me in a way that made my stomach tighten. She said nothing at first, just reached under the counter and handed me a small brass key, along with a neatly folded piece of paper.

Her fingers lingered on the edges of the paper as I took it from her.

""Read this carefully,"" she said, her voice quiet, measured. ""And follow every rule.""

There was no warmth in her words, no unnecessary pleasantries. Just a warning wrapped in a simple instruction.

I hesitated, glancing toward the wall near the entrance. A faded list of rules was taped there, its edges curling with age, the ink smudged and uneven. I barely glanced at it, assuming it was the usual—No Smoking, No Loud Music, No Guests After 10 PM. I should have paid more attention. I should have stopped and read every word.

Instead, I unfolded the paper in my hands, and as my eyes scanned the list, my stomach twisted into a tight knot.

**Boarding House Rules:**

1. **Lock your door before midnight. Do not open it for anyone until sunrise.**
2. **If you hear knocking past midnight, ignore it. No matter who they claim to be, they are not real.**
3. **Always greet the old man in Room 7 if you see him in the hallway. If he doesn’t greet you back, hide in the nearest room immediately.**
4. **Do not eat food left outside your door. No one in this house leaves food for others.**
5. **If you wake up and feel someone watching you, do not move. Do not speak. Close your eyes until morning.**
6. **If you hear the landlady humming past midnight, do not look out of your window. Do not let her know you are awake.**

My hands tightened around the paper, the words blurring slightly as I reread them. My mouth felt dry.

""This isn’t a joke, is it?"" I asked, my voice quieter than I had intended.

Mrs. Carter didn’t answer immediately. She only studied me, her expression blank, before shaking her head once.

""Follow the rules, You’ll be fine."" she repeated. 

And just like that, she turned and walked away, her slow, deliberate steps echoing down the hallway.

I stood there, my heart hammering. The paper felt heavier in my hands now. My mind told me it was ridiculous—some weird tradition, an old superstition meant to scare new tenants. But deep down, somewhere in the part of my brain that still clung to instinct, I knew—**I had just made a terrible mistake by moving in.**

I went to My room. It was small but clean. A bed, a wooden desk, a single chair near the window. The walls were a dull beige, bare except for a single painting of a forest that looked too dark, too deep. I ran a hand along the desk’s surface. Dust-free. Everything was strangely spotless, as if no one had truly lived here before.

The walls were thin. I could hear faint shuffling, the quiet murmurs of my neighbors settling in for the night. A floorboard creaked somewhere in the hallway. I swallowed hard and double-checked my door, twisting the lock with a sharp click. Then, I climbed into bed, the folded paper resting on the nightstand beside me. The rules ran through my mind like a looping whisper.

I wasn’t sure how long I lay there, staring at the ceiling. At some point, my eyelids grew heavy. Sleep crept in. The silence of the room wrapped around me like a thick fog.

And then—I heard something.

**A Knock**

Again and again.

My eyes snapped open. A cold wave of fear crashed through me.

A voice followed.

""Hey, man, it’s Adam. My key isn't working. Can you open up?""

Adam. My next-door neighbor. I had met him earlier—friendly, talkative, the kind of guy who could make any place feel normal. He had been here for three months. He had smiled when he introduced himself. He had **seemed real.**

But the second rule echoed in my mind.

**If you hear knocking past midnight, ignore it. No matter who they claim to be, they are not real.**

I gripped the blanket, my breath shallow. My heartbeat thudded against my ribs.

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

Adam’s voice again. This time, there was a slight edge to it.

""Come on, man. I just need you to open the door for a second. Please.""

I almost answered. Almost.

But something was wrong. His voice—it sounded close, **too close**, like he was whispering right against the wood. And yet, there was something else. A flatness. A hollowness. Like an imitation of a voice, someone trying to **sound like Adam** but failing in the smallest, most unnatural ways.

I clenched my fists, forcing myself to stay silent.

The knocking stopped.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

For the rest of the night, I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, waiting for the sun to rise.

The next morning, I stepped into the hallway, feeling the weight of exhaustion pressing on me.

I hadn’t slept. Not really. Every creak of the floor, every distant sound in the walls, every whisper of wind outside had kept me frozen beneath my blanket, listening—**waiting**—for something I couldn't see. When morning finally came, it didn’t feel like relief. It felt like a **temporary** escape, like something was letting me go, just for a little while.

The hallway was quiet, bathed in dull gray light filtering in from a small, dust-covered window at the end of the corridor. I turned toward the kitchen, the thought of coffee the only thing keeping me upright. And then—

I saw him.

**The old man from Room 7.**

He stood completely still in the middle of the hallway, his frail frame wrapped in a tattered, oversized sweater that hung off his shoulders like it belonged to someone else. His skin was pale, almost gray, stretched too thin over sharp cheekbones. His lips were cracked, and his eyes—dark, sunken—**hollow.** They stared at me, unblinking.

The air shifted. A chill ran up my spine, sharp and immediate.

I forced myself to speak. ""Good morning.""

The words felt small, insignificant against the weight of the silence between us.

He didn’t respond.

My throat tightened.

**Always greet the old man in Room 7. If he doesn’t greet you back, hide immediately.**

Third Rule flashed in my mind.

My pulse quickened. I glanced around, searching for the nearest door, calculating how fast I could reach it. The hallway stretched longer than it had before, or maybe that was just my fear twisting reality.

Seconds dragged. The silence felt alive, pressing against my skin.

Then—finally—he moved.

A slow, deliberate nod. No words, no expression. Just that single motion before he turned, shuffling toward his door.

I let out a shaky breath.

**I had followed the rule.**

But as his door clicked shut behind him, a cold thought crawled into my mind—**what would have happened if I hadn’t?**

Well, shaking off that clingy feeling, I went to work.

That evening, I returned from work, exhausted.

The day had been long, but my mind had been longer. I had spent most of it replaying the morning, the old man’s face, the weight of that silence. I told myself I was overreacting. It was just an old man. Just a weird set of rules. That was all.

But when I reached my door, I stopped.

A plate of food sat neatly on the floor. A bowl of soup and a slice of bread.

My stomach twisted, hunger gnawing at me after skipping breakfast and barely touching lunch. My first thought was **maybe Mrs. Carter left it.** Maybe it was some sort of welcome gesture.

And then my fingers curled into fists as I repeated the Rule Number–4 in my head.

**Do not eat food left outside your door. No one in this house leaves food for others.**

I swallowed hard.

The hallway was empty.

I bent down, hesitating before picking up the plate. The ceramic was cool, the silver lid covering the bowl gleaming under the dim hallway light. The smell of something familiar, something faintly metallic, drifted up.

My unease deepened.

I carried the plate to the kitchen, every step heavier than the last. I wasn’t going to eat it—**obviously**—but I needed to see what was inside.

With a slow breath, I lifted the lid.

**The stench hit me instantly.**

Rotting meat. Foul, wet, **wrong**. My stomach lurched, bile rising in my throat.

This wasn’t soup. It was something thick, dark, clotted in strange, pulsing lumps. Something **moved** beneath the surface, shifting sluggishly like it was alive but struggling to stay that way.

I gagged, my hands trembling as I **hurled** the plate into the trash, the bowl shattering against the inside of the bin. The stench lingered, curling into my nostrils, clinging to the back of my throat.

I turned to leave.

And then—I saw him.

**The old man from Room 7.**

Standing in the hallway.

Watching me.

His face was blank, unreadable. His dark eyes never blinked.

Then—slowly, deliberately—he **nodded once.**

And walked away.

That night, I lay in bed, every muscle in my body was tense.

I had locked the door. I had checked it twice. I had pulled the blanket up to my chin like it could protect me from whatever lurked beyond these walls. But none of that mattered. Not really. Because something was **wrong** in this house.

And then, at exactly **3:12 AM**, I heard it.

A soft humming, drifting through the hallway like a lullaby meant for something **else**.

My stomach twisted. I knew that tune.

I had heard it earlier that day—Mrs. Carter, humming to herself as she wiped the counter, her voice light and distant. 

**It had seemed harmless then.** But now?

Now, it feels **different**.

The sound grew clearer, threading its way through the thin walls, curling into the cracks of my room like smoke. It was calm, slow—**too slow**, like someone drawing out each note deliberately.

And, The sixth rule says.

**If you hear the landlady humming past midnight, do not look out of your window. Do not let her know you are awake.**

I gripped my blanket, my pulse hammering in my ears. **Don’t look. Don’t move.**

The humming grew louder & **Closer.**

And then—**footsteps.**

Soft, measured, dragging lightly across the wooden floor outside my room. Each step deliberate, stretching out the distance between them, like whoever was walking was **listening** for something.

They stopped—**Right outside my door.**

My breath caught in my throat.

The door. **Locked. It was locked.**

But the footsteps didn’t leave.

And then—the doorknob **rattled.**

A slow, testing turn. **Once. Twice.**

My entire body locked up.

I clenched my eyes shut, forcing myself not to move, not to breathe too loud, not to **exist** in that moment. Maybe if I stayed still enough, she would go away.

And then, as suddenly as it had started, The humming **stopped.**

The air in the room felt suffocating, thick with something unseen.

For a long, agonizing moment—**silence.**

And then—

A whisper.

Soft. Right outside the door.

**""I know you’re awake.""**

A cold shiver crawled down my spine, sinking deep into my bones.

I didn’t react. I didn’t move.

I couldn’t.

Seconds stretched into eternity.

Then—finally—**footsteps again.**

Moving away.

Slow.

Measured.

The humming started up once more, fading—drifting down the hallway, melting into the night.

I lay there, frozen, staring into the darkness until morning.

By the next evening, I had made up my mind. **I was leaving.**

I couldn’t stay in this house—not after last night, not after the rules kept proving themselves real.

I shoved my clothes into my bag, my hands shaking, my mind screaming at me to hurry. **Just get out. Don’t look back. Don’t question it. Just leave.**

But as I stepped into the hallway, a cold wave of dread washed over me.

I **froze.**

At the far end of the hall, the old man from Room 7 stood perfectly still.

His frail frame seemed smaller in the dim light, his hollow eyes locked onto me. **Waiting. Watching.**

I swallowed hard. **Greet him. Say something.**

""Good evening,"" I forced out, my voice tight.

Silence.

He didn’t move.

He didn’t blink.

He didn’t **greet me back.**

My stomach twisted violently.

**If he doesn’t greet you back, hide in the nearest room immediately.**

I turned, heart hammering, scanning for an open door—**any door.**

But before I could move—

**The hallway lights flickered.**

A deep, wet breathing sound slithered through the air, thick and unnatural, coming from everywhere and nowhere all at once.

And then—

Something shifted in the shadows.

The space at the end of the hall **stretched**, as if the walls were bending, pulling apart. **Something was there. Something big. Something wrong.**

The nearest door creaked open.

I didn’t hesitate.

I **ran.**

I dove inside and **slammed** the door shut behind me.

From Outside—**A Dragging Sound Came.**

Slow. Heavy. **Scraping against the floor.**

Something was moving down the hallway.

And then—

**Knock. Knock.** 

I squeezed my eyes shut. **No. Not again.**

A voice, muffled through the door—

**""Hey, man, it’s Adam. My key isn’t working. Can you open up?""**

I clamped a hand over my mouth. **Not real. It’s not real.**

The knocking didn’t stop.

**Knock. Knock.** 

My breath hitched in my throat, every muscle in my body screaming **“stay silent”.**

Then—

A pause.

A whisper.

Right against the door.

**""I know you’re awake.""**

The lights in the room **flickered.**

And then—

The door handle **started to turn.**

**The handle twisted.**

The door swung open.

And something—**something unseen, something cold, something hungry—grabbed me.**

The air **rushed** out of my lungs as an invisible force **dragged** me forward.

The walls twisted, stretched, swallowed me whole—

**Darkness.**

**Pressure.**

Like I had fallen into something deep, something endless, something that didn’t want to let go.

I **tried** to scream.

But there was no sound.

No air.

No **me.**

I don’t remember what happened after that.

But when I woke up in the morning… my room was still there.

My bags—still packed.

The bed—untouched.

But **I** was gone.

Outside **Room 7,** a fresh piece of paper was taped to the wall.

The rules—**unchanged.**

Except for one.

A new line—written in dark, uneven letters, pressed deep into the page.

**""If you hear someone knocking and claiming to be the new tenant… ignore them. They are not real.""**",5,1741145803.0,Ruleshorror,2,1.0,False

Beautiful. I haven't had this much fun in ck3 since my Islamic Italy + Vampiric Cyrodiil playthroughs. And unlike those, this one hasn't ended due to updates breaking the game as soon as I start taking in how much fun I'm having. And then on top of all of that, I spend 10+ minutes just looking throughout the world because everything happening is super interesting. Amazing mod and developers!

I'm thinking about playing as my child of destiny when I die and adventuring over to Colombia and uniting the place. Portia went ham in Central America and I think it'd be fun dealing with the Nyabinghi blob over there. While I'm having fun in Brazil, I feel like creating a fat kingdom up there and joining it with the Empire at some point

Also what is the throne of Brazil called? California has the Golden Throne and I feel Brazil would have something similar since it's the ""china"" of the AtE universe (moreso for ck2, but the dev logs acknowledge that still).

I (26F) was diagnosed with osteoporosis a couple years ago after running and slipping on the hardwood floor (very Charlie Brown coded) and shattering my tibia. Doctor thought the break was odd, and found out I got the bone holes :(
Once I healed up, I started taking vitamin d supplements maybe 4 times a week (I tend to forget them) and either walk or run or swim 20 minutes a day also about 3 times a week.
I didn’t take this diagnosis too seriously until reading up on it on this sub. I’m curious if what I’m doing is enough? Or if you recommend other supplements outside of vitamin D. Also upon reading, I believe my habits of drinking 3-4 cups of coffee a day and typically a beer/glass of wine every other day may not be helping this case. Do I need to cut these joys in life cold turkey (I love a beverage), or consume in moderation? I also typically eat a balanced meal with plenty of protein. But if there are any specific foods you recommend that’d be lovely!
I’m finally getting another dexa scan in a few weeks to track progress, I couldn’t tell you the original dexa numbers from the top of my head unfortunately.

Lastly, should I start being more serious about finding out WHY I have this? No family history of osteo (just thyroid issues), I have always been underweight, and have been on birth control (thus stopping periods) for the last 10 years, and until recently have lived a pretty sedentary lifestyle involving LOTS of coffee and Mountain Dew (once again love a beverage!!)

My apologies if this information is elsewhere on this sub! Whenever I try to research it, it seems difficult to apply to my situation since I’m 26. And there is so much (sometimes conflicting) information that I get overwhelmed in finding what’s best. Of course, I’ll be scheduling a wellness checkup with my PCP once my dexa comes back, but figured to prepare any questions that any potential responses may suggest asking about. 

Thank you for taking the time to read!!

He always struggled with anxiety, and as he got older he realized alcohol helped him cope ""the best"". He drinks 4 bottles of wine a day at his worst. 2 a day as the norm.

Last December, my ex and I got into an argument and he pushed me so aggressively repeatedly his watch cut me up pretty badly as I put my hands up to protect myself.

My christian sister offered to let me live with her and her family temporarily. It is also important to note I am on disability for having a rare genetic condition where I get slow growing cancerous tumors that requires surgery frequently.

My sisters husband is so irritating, I am debating on moving back in with my abusive ex. My sisters husband yells at my sister at the top of his lungs. He is a chauvinist. He is also a closeted alcoholic.

My ex and I got into one physical altercation, but other than that he was somewhat easy to live with. My sisters husband is the dumbest human being I have ever met. I KID YOU NOT, her husband believes anyone who smokes weed was raped/molested in their childhood. He told me to my face, and tells his children and my sister, that I smoke weed ( and my younger sister) because we were molested by my father but I can't remember it because it happened when I was too young to remember (not even slightly true!). I told my younger sister this and she was shocked and could not believe how dumb this man is. She seriously thinks he is not trying to piss me off, and is just an alcoholic running his mouth.

Her husband has also told me I got cancer because I am not a Christian, and it may have also been from sugar... LOL. My geneticist told me it's 100% genetic cancer and I can't do anything about it.

My sisters husband is so insane, I'm seriously considering moving back in with my abusive ex. My brother-in-laws antics are daily; he literally can't go a fucking day without trying to piss me off somehow with really offensive shit.

I also have a german shepherd who he abuses daily by yelling at the top of his lungs or pushing very aggressively. He insists my dog cannot enter the kitchen at all, and if he does, he will yell. My dog had a hard time moving in with a family, and he is a fucking dog and if you leave food on a coffee table or a counter unattended, he's going to try and swipe it. Which apparently is a reason to yell at a dog so aggressively, my dog shakes when I'm not around. He has taught his 12 year old son to act the same way with my dog.

My ex was only abusive to me and not my dog. He only ever pushed me around once. I also have a feeling if he quit drinking he'd never do it again. I literally hate my brother-in-law so much, I can't take living with him.

What would you do?

Edit: I am also on a waiting list for subsided housing, which my social worker said it could take a year before I get a place.

Let's be honest, folks. We've all seen the news lately. Japan's shaking, Alaska's rumbling, California's doing its best impression of a maraca, and even here in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, we're feeling a few jitters. I'm starting to think my bookshelf has a secret vendetta against me, given how much it's been swaying.

Remember that ""minor"" tremor last week? I swear my coffee mug did the Macarena. And don't even get me started on the chaos in the grocery store aisle when everyone realized the ""earthquake-proof"" toilet paper fort they'd built was, well, not so earthquake-proof.

Look, I'm all for living in the moment, but when ""the moment"" involves the ground trying to do the tango with your foundation, it's time to get serious. I've seen more people Googling ""how to build a bunker out of yoga mats"" than ""how to network effectively.""

That's why we created the ""Ready for Anything"" Emergency Survival Handbook. It's free, it's packed with practical tips, and it might just save you from becoming a viral video of someone trying to use a pool noodle as a hard hat. (Trust me, I've seen it.)

**But wait, there's more!**

We also launched a podcast episode, ""Are You Ready for the Big One?"" where we delve into the nitty-gritty of earthquake preparedness. We discuss everything from the ""doorway myth"" (spoiler: it's not your safest bet) to the best way to convince your cat that the emergency kit is not a giant scratching post.

We've got real stories, expert advice, and a healthy dose of humor because let's face it, if we can't laugh at the impending apocalypse, what can we laugh at?

**Here's what you'll get:**

* **""Ready for Anything"" Handbook:** Learn how to build an emergency kit that doesn't just consist of stale crackers and a flashlight with dying batteries.
* **""Are You Ready for the Big One?"" Podcast:** Hear tales of near-misses, practical strategies, and how to tell the difference between a tremor and your neighbor's overly enthusiastic drumming.
* **Peace of mind:** Because knowing you're prepared is way better than trying to explain to your insurance company why your prized collection of garden gnomes is now buried under a pile of rubble.

I make 130-140k a year. Fortunately I can find my job just about in anywhere in the US. I am looking to move because I’m a late 30s female, single, child free and feel like I’ve wasted years of my life here going back to school. All I do is work, pick up extra shifts, go to the gym, read books, and sit in my apartment. Everyone is married and taking their kids to soccer practice. I fantasize about having friends that enjoy going to a brewery, taking trips, attending classes, going to cooking classes, and etc. I have tried to make that happen where I live currently. It’s too difficult to find people like myself that are interested in socializing. I have 3 basic requirements. 

1.) I am looking for somewhere where I can afford a townhome or small house that doesn’t look like a serial killer’s humble abode from 1984. 

2.) I am looking for somewhere where I can enrich my social life.

3.) I am looking for somewhere where there are activities I can enjoy. I do like outdoor stuff, but if I  can’t afford the area then I’d like to live somewhere where it’s normal for people to be out and about at book stores, breweries, restaurants, parks, food trucks, golf, coffee shops, walking dogs, wineries. 

I thought I wanted somewhere like SLC, Denver, Boise because of the outdoor appeal, sunshine, seasonal weather, population that values outdoor activities. I can’t find a single place within my budget that isn’t an absolute eye sore.

I’ve thought about Tampa. I could afford a house there. I could maybe even make friends to go to the beach with, or go fishing, or maybe even go boating. The no income tax is also appealing. But the thought of 80-95 degree weather year around does not appeal to me. The bugs do not appeal to me. The hurricane risk is scary.

I’ve thought about Raleigh. But it’s described as a sprawling suburbia which is the type of environment I live in now. I think I’d be happy with a sprawling suburbia IF there were activities to do (see above).

I’ve thought about Dallas because I could afford a beautiful home there. My career field pays well here. No income tax. But it sounds hot and flat and what is there to do??

So basically:
- I want to be able to afford to live there.
- I want to have opportunity to do EVEN JUST ONE of the following:
         —- hiking, fishing, camping, trail running, boating, biking, jogging, green spaces 
- I want to live somewhere where I can feel a more enriched social life.

I am open to any and all suggestions. All politics. All areas. Any place that fits is a welcome and appreciated suggestion.

I've been, pretty much all over the world. From the bright lights of south east Asia to the rolling meadows of western Europe. But there was one spot that had up until recently, eluded me. Australia. Well, I finally bit the bullet and booked my dream trip down under. I'd love to sit here and tell you all about how incredible it was. How I saw some of the most unique sights I had ever seen in my life. To a point I suppose that's true. But I won't be going back there…

You see, I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of the Australian Outback, with its vast empty nothingness stretching as far as the eye can see. Something about getting yourself lost in its beauty, it's equal parts terrifying and exciting. So that’s exactly what I planned to do. It's also why Australia had remained unattainable to me up until quite recently. I was set on doing things... differently. I didn't want to do what every dime a dozen tourist did. I had no interest in seeing the sights of the cities, I mean I’m sure they’re beautiful in their own right, but for me, I wanted to get out into the wilds as quickly as possible.

I did some research beforehand, jumped onto some local Aussie backpacking travel groups on Facebook and I ended up getting quite friendly with a local. His name was Chris and he was part Indigenous Australian. Aboriginal Dad, and his Mother of Irish heritage. We got to talking and upon hearing all about my wishes to see the more secluded sights of Australia, he agreed to be my tour guide for the trip.

Alright! All was set. I flew into Sydney on a cold July morning. Yeah that’s their winter months down there. I was so excited as the Sydney Harbour bridge and the Opera House slowly came into view upon our descent beneath the clouds. I was right, the cities were beautiful in their own regard but still, that’s not what I was here to see.

I met my tour guide Chris at the airport and we hastily made our way to his vehicle, a stereotypical rusty Holden ute, and began the trek out west. The drive was bloody beautiful and I highly recommend you try it at least once in your lifetime. We eventually cleared the western suburbs of Sydney passing through Parramatta, Blacktown and Penrith before the urban scenery slowly began to give way to beautiful wide open spaces. Yeah, this is what I’ve been waiting for.

The drive continued on for hours as we passed through quaint little outback communities, some of which genuinely looked like ghost towns. It was awe inspiring to see the colours of this barren landscape change as we drove deeper toward the centre. Brown, dry bushland interspersed with pockets of green slowly transitioning into hot red earth. I was mesmerised. It was a long drive out there but I was so captivated by the sights I was seeing I honestly didn't notice. Eventually, just as night began to fall, we reached Broken Hill. This sprawling inland mining city deep in the heart of outback New South Wales was to be our base for exploring the remote wilderness of Mutawintji National Park.

We would stay the night here in Broken Hill. It was too late to start the hike into the park, Chris explained to me. It was already creeping into the afternoon hours, and if we got caught in the dark too far from a good spot to make camp, that could spell real danger out there. I wasn't going to argue. He knew this place better than I did. I was excited to get out there and really start exploring, but I'd also had little sleep on the long haul down here, and I wasn't going to say no to a good night's rest.

We checked into a quaint little hotel. Now, when I say hotel, I mean the Australian depiction of that term. If you're picturing the Hilton, think again. When Aussies say ""hotel"", they mean the bare necessities you need in a room, situated on the second floor on top of a pub (a bar). Falling asleep to the sounds of drunken Australian men shouting at eachother about two different types of football, neither of which I understand, was certainly something. But I was so tired at this point it didn't pose much of a barrier in my journey to slumber. A few pages into a good book and I was out like a light.

_____________

I awoke the next morning to the smells of breakfast and the sounds of my fellow guests shuffling their way down the stairs to dig into it. I was close behind them, ravenous after not eating very well at all the past couple of days. Aussies sure know how to start the day with a good breakfast. Well, a big one anyway, I don't imagine it would score too high a health rating. Mountains of bacon, sausage and eggs were loaded up onto a plate and I was given a huge mug of coffee to wash it down with. I'm... not really too big a fan of starting the day off with a heavy meal, but I got the feeling I wasn't in the best company to raise any complaints.

After breakfast, I met up with Chris and we loaded our gear into his ute. Before long, we were out on the open road again, surrounded by the endless red horizon. He wasn’t wrong. This place was remote. It was a few hours drive to the nearest entry point and from there we were on foot. We had everything we needed in our packs but still, there was something quite unnerving about trekking into such a vast open wasteland with not even a vehicle to retreat into should things go sideways. But, this is what I came for. And I was going to see it through.

That first step was something truly magical. The barely audible crunch of the soft top layer of dirt before my boot sunk into the red earth, it was surreal. I had waited so long to see this land, I couldn't quite believe I was actually here. Finally. The first day was full of little moments like that. The first time seeing a mob of kangaroos hop by in the distance. The first time smelling eucalyptus. The first time fearing for my life, as Chris threw an abrupt hand signal up in front of my face just in time to stop me traipsing ignorantly into a large eastern brown snake’s path. That sure got the blood up. And the first time seeing a billabong cresting the horizon after a full day of hiking, that was a sight to behold. 

It was around 4 or 5 in the afternoon by that point, so we decided to make camp for the night. It had been a long day, and I was starving. Thankfully Chris had picked up a few recipes from his old man during his childhood years growing up in a remote outback settlement. “Bush tucker” they call it down there. Chris cooked up a hot stew, and we had that with what they call damper, the “bread of the bush”. It’s actually really cool to see someone make bread using nothing but ingredients pulled straight from the land. It’s made using wattleseed and saltbush. It’s not much for the taste buds, but let me tell you, when you’re out there with nothing but the clothes on your back and whatever the land grants you, being able to fill your belly with bread is a beautiful thing. 

It was a great way to end what had been an amazing start to my first venture into the Australian outback. We set up our camp beneath some gum trees, nearby that beautiful billabong. It was of course far too cold for any swimming but the ambiance was nice. There was a trickle in a nearby stream and the crackle of the campfire had me off to sleep very quickly.

————————-

It must have been close to, or maybe just past midnight, when I awoke from a sound sleep, to a hand pressing against my mouth. This is obviously not a great way to wake up deep in the Aussie wilderness and believe me in that moment there were many thoughts of Australia’s outback serial killers racing through my mind. But as it would happen, it was Chris. His eyes were wide and he had a finger pressed against his lips, telling me in no uncertain terms to keep my mouth shut.

I began to glance around trying to find the source of Chris’s sudden panicked state. Looking around, at first I didn’t notice anything, just the vast expanse of the open outback in every direction. Nothing but darkness, and the infinite void of this ancient land. What made this experience even more terrifying is that we didn’t even have the cover of a tent, we were just camping out rough in our swags. I had no idea what to expect, I had visions of dangerous wild animals hunting us, circling in around us. That’s when Chris lifted a single hand and pointed down toward the water hole and whispered one word… “Nadubi”.

It took me a while in my sleepy state to process what I was looking at. In a flash I was reminded of every sleep deprived night spent as a kid after staying up late and watching my Dad’s scary werewolf films, for that is almost exactly what I was looking at here. It looked in every possible way, bar some subtle differences, like a werewolf. It stood bolt upright on two jagged hind legs, its arms slumped down by its sides and its head hung downward, its scrunched up face moulding into a slender snout which looked more beak-like than that of a dog.

It began to slowly creep around the waterhole, my eyes remaining fixed on it the whole time. With each step the dry earth crunched beneath it, and each one of those sounds will forever remain burned into my memory as with every one of them I thought for sure this thing was making its slow approach towards us. As it came closer to our side of the small pond I began to notice more alarming features about this thing. It may have resembled a werewolf in form and posture but that is where the similarities ended. Its entire body, was covered in what looked to be sharp tendrils, like a porcupine.

I watched as it sniffed at the still night air, I suppose searching for something it could call a meal. I don’t know. I’m unsure what its purpose was, what its motives were. But by the look of it neither could have been good. Chris, ever so slowly and carefully, pulled the small swag blanket over the both of us, and we huddled there in place, hoping and praying that we would go unnoticed.

For a series of very, very long hours, we lay there in the silence of the desolate Australian outback, as we listened to this thing take measured paces around our camp. It just, walked around, occasionally sniffing at our packs and some of the food we had left around camp. Intermittently, we would hear the unmistakable sounds of slurping. I guessed at that point it must have found itself some leftovers. Every so often it would retreat back over to the other side of the waterhole, from what we could hear anyway, but would then return. It seemed like it was waiting for something. Perhaps it thought somebody might be coming back, for whatever reason unaware that we were right there beneath the thin swag blanket.

It was, undoubtedly, the single most horrifying night of my life. The thoughts that were running through my mind after seeing this thing. Thinking about what it could do to us with that nightmarish form it carried with it. It was beyond terrifying.

We did not dare move that whole night. And it’s a good thing! As it would, in the end, be the light of day which would arrive as our saviours. I guess it didn’t much like the light, or perhaps the early morning heat it brought with it as it made its ascent, as we heard this thing very quickly run away as soon as the morning rays began making their way across our camp.

It still took us another good hour before we could summon the bravery to emerge from our makeshift hiding spot. I almost wish we had not. As we rose from our tiny sanctuary, and got a look at what had once been our tranquil little campsite, we were even more horrified than we had been the night before. We were greeted by the sight of many, many corpses. Lizards, possums, fish, snakes, even some kangaroos. Their bodies, lifeless. Seemingly, they were untouched. You wouldn’t even know they had been attacked in any way, were it not for the small holes in their bellies, and those disgusting slurping noises we had heard the night before.

We made haste getting out of there, needless to say. We stayed a night back in Broken Hill, and set off for the drive back east the next morning. The drive back to Sydney was a lot more solemn than the one we had taken on the way out there. Chris barely spoke. I almost didn’t want to break the silence but there were questions on my mind. That thing was obviously not of this world and yet he seemed to know exactly what it was at a glance. While not entirely certain of course, Chris shared with me that what we had seen, was most likely a Nadubi. It is an Indigenous tale of a grotesque, echidna like dog man which hunts by night. I didn’t get much more out of him, he looked as shaken as I was, understandably so. Despite growing up hearing many of these stories, I could tell by his demeanour this was the first time he had encountered one first hand.

I did end up staying a few more nights in Sydney. Honestly, I was still in a state of shock. I probably would have been on the next flight out had I been in any state of mind to book one. But I just, couldn’t. So I stuck around, until I could think straight. It wasn’t all bad I suppose, I ended up seeing a few sights around the city. I have a whole new appreciation for cities. Whilst I do still appreciate the blissful peace of the wilderness, I choose to admire it from afar. I have seen what lurks within the unexplored pockets of the Australian outback. I have seen why so many who venture too deep within fail to return.

For those of you wishing to experience it for yourself, I will not tell you what to do. I will leave you with only one piece of advice. That you educate yourself. Not only by the standards of modern humanity’s limited knowledge of this land, but listen to the stories of those who have lived here since ancient times. 

Do not underestimate their wisdom. It may very well save your life.",1,1741143927.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,1.0,False

It's the little things, truly.

The intentional words and actions.

It's when he shows up with my favorite snacks/dessert (even though we're usually too busy to stop and enjoy them). 😏

How he learns me and selects gifts that are meaningful.

He keeps me open to him and craving him because he makes me feel safe to explore with him sexually and share vulnerabilities with him emotionally.

It's hot, bringing our fantasies to life. I want what turns him on, he wants what turns me on.  🔥🫦🪢

We LOVE to spoil each other because of how invested we are. It's the little things...

He has:

-Sent me voice notes when he knows I'm having a rough day or missing him.

-Had a coffee/drinks waiting for my arrival.

-Stopped by an adult store to grab a few of the  sexy accessories we discussed liking/trying.

-Recorded Elton on keys, Mayer on strings, and recorded a mutual favorite song by a band we saw together & changed the lyrics slightly to customize them just for me. 🥰🫠🥵

-Sent the link to the map on the entrance of the parking garage (and not just the place) in an attempt to make the drive easier for me.

-Danced with me in the living room of our hotel suite.

And, SO much more.

I have:

-Used my sugar for things he gets the benefit of, too. And, sent him messages about it or sneak peeks... because that teasing anticipation feels so good. (He never expects this, but loves it.)

-Rented a storage unit - for OUR things. Lingerie, expanding toy collection, gifts we get each other. I call it our sexy-love unit. 

-Bought a permanent bracelet (with 🍬) to represent him and us. It's the one thing that stays on 24/7... when everything else comes off. I love it. He loves it. It's 🔥 for both of us.

-Shown up with meaningful gifts to celebrate milestones, sexy gifts & outfits to add to our pleasure/experience, and inside joke gifts. He knows I'm always thinking of him.

-Made him chocolate from scratch.


We play connection games, sexy games, get out of our comfort zones together, and do our best to make each other feel special & desired.

Today is 6 months since he found me in this sub and took a chance on sending me a message.

And, I'm so happy & grateful he did!

What if you saw a disturbing glimpse of your future in a dream, and no matter how hard you tried to avoid it, you ended up causing it to happen?

Well, It happened to me. And I'd like to share it with you.

First a little background:
I was just a 12 year old kid, before the advent of cell phones, streaming media, or even the internet for that matter, I didn’t know much about ‘precognition’ and things of that nature. No, my biggest pursuits were comic books, collecting Hot Wheels cars, and supporting my video game addiction over at the local arcade.
  
The year was 1978.
  
Anyway, so I got this little weekend job down at the swap meet (about two blocks from my house) helping out this old Chinese vendor named Chung. The job was simple; meet Chung at the Drive-in theater early Saturday and Sunday morning to help set up his vendor stall with merchandise consisting of knock-off Gucci bags, pocketbooks, and assorted women’s shoes, then assisting him throughout the day. At the end of the day Chung would hand me a nice crispy $10.00 bill. 
  
I was making 20 bucks a week, which in 1978 afforded me the latest issues of Mad Magazine and collectible Hot Wheels, as well as a shot at that new video game over at the arcade called ‘Space Invaders’.
  
On one Friday night I sat on the edge of my bed, reached over to my nightstand and picked up my little alarm clock to set it for work the next morning. Swap meet vendors had to be there early so that they could set up and be ready to meet the throngs of shoppers coming in at 7:00 when the ticket gates opened.
  
My alarm clock was an old vintage wind-up handed down to me from my grandmother. It had a round face and two little bells on top that would ring when the hour hand reached the third hand, (also known as the ‘alarm hand’). I set the alarm hand for 5:30, wound the clock spring, and placed it back on my nightstand. I prided myself on being on time…a characteristic that was instilled in me from the time I learned to work for my own money.
  
I was an industrious young man of morals and integrity. I had the world by the horns… or so I thought.
  
I put my pajamas on and laid my work clothes out on a chair, then tucked myself in for the night. I must have slept extremely well that night. We’re talking deep R.E.M. sleep. The kind where time seems to no longer exist. Then I had a lucid dream. A very unsettling lucid dream. It went something like this:
  
I’m walking through a door, and there, about 30 to 35 feet in front of me was my boss, Chung, squatting down in front of his vendor stall that was completely set up, with purses and handbags hanging from hooks on the shade structure. His display tables were adorned with colorful tablecloths, loaded with pocketbooks, coin purses and other accessories. 
  
He was straightening a pair of red shoes he had arranged on the tarmac up front. I had missed setup. I was suddenly flushed with the realization that I was late for work. That feeling of pure anxiety washed over me like a bucket of ice cold water.
  
I stood shocked and dumbfounded as Chung looked over his shoulder and spotted me. He nodded his head with a grin and started to speak. But the sound that came out was not that of his voice, but a loud, steady ringing sound. The sound of a bell.
  
Suddenly I was ripped from my dream, and I bolted upright in bed to the sound of my alarm clock going off. It was 5:30 and time to get ready for work. I reached over and turned it off, then rubbed my eyes, anxious with that feeling of being late that lingered with repeating visions from that stupid dream. 
  
I felt like I had just closed my eyes only to be rudely awakened again. I shrugged it off and went to the bathroom to begin my morning ritual for work. 
  
But the dream kept replaying itself over and over in my head like a 10-second video clip stuck on a loop. The finished displays. The red shoes. The grin on Chung’s face. The feeling of being late. And what the hell was he about to say just before my alarm clock jolted me out of it? I just couldn’t shake it despite the fact that I had gotten up on time and there was nothing keeping me from getting to work on time that morning. 
  
Nonetheless, I picked up my pace a little bit just to make sure that dream playing out over and over again, and that feeling of dread that comes with showing up late for work, would just go away.
  
I felt a bit silly as I donned my clothes a little quicker, and tied my old suede wallabies a little faster than I normally would. I slipped my wrist watch on and checked the time against my alarm clock for a match. “This is ludicrous”, I thought to myself. “There’s no way I can be late. If anything I’ll be super early.”
  
I cut the time I would normally spend getting ready to go to work in half by skipping breakfast, and set out on foot at 10 minutes to 6 in the chilly morning darkness toward the Drive-in theater that waited for me about a block and a half away from my house. 
  
The light of dawn wouldn’t break for another half-hour or so. And, as it has been all season, my job was to show up around 6:30 a.m., meet Chung at our usual spot, and we would knock out the setup by 7:00…just in time for the shoppers to be allowed in. 
  
But this time it would be “a little bit different” I thought to myself as I shuffled down my empty street toward the quiet four lane thoroughfare.  Ignoring the crosswalk, I jogged across the thoroughfare toward the main gate of the Drive-in theater with its landmark forty-foot screen looming in the distance. 
  
The dream quickened my pace. I scoffed and fought the urge to break into a run. 
  
It was unusually foggy that morning too. As I made my way through the shadows I couldn’t help but notice the ominous looking halos of swirling mist surrounding each street lamp. The theme song from ‘The Twilight Zone’ kept trying to seep into the cracks in my overactive imagination. 
  
And that damn dream. That dream was still fresh on my mind as I entered the gate and waved at the security guard leaning in the door frame of his guard shack. He recognized me with a nod of his head, his face half-lit by one single incandescent light bulb from within. He pulled the cigarette from his lips with thumb and forefinger and let out a puff of thick, gray smoke. “Here a little early, arencha?” 
  
I shook my head and shoved my hands in my pockets as I thought about how ridiculous it was for me to be here at this hour. There was literally no one there except for the snack bar/café crew in the center of the Drive-in  lot. I headed straight for it. I needed to get my head on straight. I needed a cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed donut. 
  
I walked into the café and up to the service counter. The place was completely empty  except for those bleary-eyed workers who were busy doing their morning prep for the coming rush of customers. “Their day starts a lot earlier than mine”, I reckoned as I took in the aroma of fresh coffee and baked goods. 
  
I ordered my cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed with a $2 bill, and got two quarters change. I grabbed an Auto Trader magazine from a rack by the entrance and scanned the area for a good place to sit.
  
Through large windows I could see a panoramic view of the outside area. I spotted a booth and sat down from where I had an unobstructed view of our spot. I wanted to see Chung the moment he arrived so I could go out to greet him early. 
  
I felt so foolish as I stirred the sugar and powdered creamer into my cup, and chuckled to myself as I thumbed through the magazine. The dream faded for now, my mind preoccupied by the taste of fresh coffee and the flavor of that old fashioned glazed delicacy. 
  
About halfway through my cup of coffee I glanced at my watch. It was 6:35 (about the time I would normally show up). By now the light of dawn was just beginning to illuminate the cloudless sky, and the fog that had invaded the early morning was gone. 
  
Vendors were rapidly arriving en masse, claiming their spots. The clinking and clanking of their shade structure poles reverberated throughout the Drive-in as the they got busy unloading their vehicles and setting up their vending stalls. 
  
Vendors began filing into the café to get their morning caffeine and sugar fix. I stared blankly at our spot. Empty. Was Chung running late? I knew that his commute was considerably longer. His old cargo van had seen better days. 
  
Something was not right. The spaces on either side of ours were already busy with vendors and their helpers skillfully fastening leg poles to corner pieces, and stretching canvas tarps with bungee cords for shade.
  
I stepped outside to use the payphone that was mounted on the wall next to the restrooms. I figured I’d call Chung at home to see if he was there. But the pay phone had an ‘Out of Order’ sign written in black marker taped across the coin slots. Go figure.
  
Back inside, I bought another cup of coffee with my last 50 cents. “Why not?” If Chung didn’t show up by the time I finished the second cup, I reasoned, then I guess he’d be considered a no-show. 
  
Heck, I could just go home and crawl back into bed for a couple more hours before the rest of my family started to rouse. Godzilla and Kung Fu reruns on Saturday morning. Yes, just what the doctor ordered. 
  
I looked over to our spot again. It was completely vacant, surrounded by a sea of shade structures, tarps, goods, with cargo vans, box trucks, and just about anything you could haul stuff in that had materialized across the tarmac of the Drive-in theater as far as the eye could see. 
  
If you’ve ever been to a swap meet you know what I’m talking about. It was now 7:00. It’s Showtime!
  
“Well, I guess that’s it”, I thought to myself as I stood up and drank the last sip from my coffee cup. Chung is a no-show. That whole dream was such a… well, it was just that…a dream. I was now free to go home and catch some shut eye, and to decompress from an otherwise stressful episode.
  
I headed for the exit on the other side of the now crowded café. Beyond it was my home less than 10 minutes away. 
  
Through the windows on that side I could see the shoppers starting to flow in from the ticket line and fan out through the isles of waiting vendors. 
  
I grabbed the doorknob and pushed it outward, and then I felt a strange rush kind of like 'deja vu' come over me. 
  
“This can’t be…”, I struggled to reason, as I walked out the door and saw…him. It was the dream. Only this time, for real.
  
I gazed in existential horror at Chung who squatted about 30 feet right in front of me. He was straightening a pair of brightly polished red pumps on display on the tarmac…and I was late.
  
My jaw went slack as my coffee cup fell from numb fingers. “Chung?”
  
Chung looked over his shoulder in my direction. He had just finished setting up his stall. Every detail was there from the hanging handbags to the accessory tables and, well…you know the rest.
  
Chung’s gaze met mine; “Oh there you are!” He said with a sheepish grin, “Sorry, I forgot to tell you…I switched spots!”

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\

1j3t9sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1j3t9sv/for_my_12th_birthday_my_dad_surprised_me_with_two/,"For my 12th birthday, my dad surprised me with two real life mermaids.","I'm currently completely at a loss what to do. 

I (21f) have just escaped my parents, after finding something horrifying in my dad’s beach house. 

I've always loved mermaids.

Yes, I was one of those kids obsessed with everything mermaid—whether that was TV shows, movies, books—any marine-related media, really, but mermaids especially.

I loved everything about the sea, about water, until I almost drowned on my fifth birthday. 

So, with a newfound fear of even dipping my toes in the shallows, I became fascinated with fake water instead. 

Mom called it a mental illness. (I can see where she was coming from, considering I asked for every pool or water-related game ever made.) But I was just a kid.

I preferred water to land, and even terrified of it, I still wanted to submerge myself in it, imagining a whole other world. 

I barely remember almost drowning, only the contorting fear twisting inside me and swallowing me up, the inability to speak, my voice cruelly torn away, my breath stolen as I sank further into the abyss—also known as the deep end of our neighbor’s pool. 

Mom said I didn’t realize it was that deep since I was used to our own pool.

There I was, sitting on the edge with my legs swinging and a plate of birthday cake in my hands, when I had the bright idea to show the adults how cute I was. 

This is my mom’s retelling, so it's probably exaggerated, but apparently, I dropped headfirst into the pool, cake and all, and sank straight to the bottom. 

Dad dove in after me, pulling me back to the surface, dragging me from the shallows. 

But it was too late.

I was screaming, hysterical, backing away from the pool like it was filled with lava. 

The crazy thing is, I remember this exact feeling. I remember staggering back, the ice-cold breeze tickling my cheeks feeling wrong compared to the warmth of the water that was supposed to protect me. 

The ice cold concrete of my neighbor’s patio felt *wrong*. 

Land felt wrong. 

The water, that had almost killed me, felt *right*, and I could never understand why. 

Instead of caressing me, this cruel underwater world had dragged me down, down, down, squeezing my lungs and stealing my air, crushing instead of cradling me. I avoided water and didn’t go near any pool after that, even ours; the very one I used to spend every spare hour splashing around in. 

When Mom tried to bathe me, I insisted on the water being ankle-deep, with her using a cup to rinse my hair as I tilted my head back, squeezing my eyes shut. 

According to Mom, I would scream until my throat was raw if there was too much water. 

Even washing my hands and brushing my teeth, I remember timing the flow just right, so I could stick my toothbrush or soapy hands under, count three elephants, and then dive out of the bathroom. I flooded the floors on multiple occasions when I forgot to turn off the faucet. 

But still, somehow, I was fascinated with water itself. 

I loved how it was still, how it ran and trickled and filled my cupped hands…. 

According to Mom, I told my therapist I wanted to be a fish.

However, my therapist had a sort of resolution. She leaned forward and grabbed my hands, squeezing them tight. 

*“Okay, Sadie, well, if you're scared of real water, why don’t you try fake water?”*

Which, I guess, is how my mermaid obsession started.

My therapist started me with little kids’ games about solving puzzles underwater—and immediately, I was hooked. 

Through my fascination with digital water, I found mermaids—beautiful, human-like fish people who could breathe underwater, living in vast, towering cities deep, deep under the sea. 

I watched every Little Mermaid, bingeing mermaid-themed movies and TV shows. 

By the age of nine, I was fully convinced I was actually a mermaid, and touching water would magically transform my legs into a tail.

It didn’t, obviously, so I did what any supposedly mentally ill nine-year-old would do. I swallowed two teaspoons of salt mixed with tears of terror before sticking my head underwater for ten seconds.

Again, nothing happened.

But I was starting to slowly overcome my fear of being submerged in water, so I lowered myself onto the stairs in the shallow end of our pool and forced myself to get used to it.

I was still acclimating when my brother shoved my head under, quickly reminding me of that sensation—the squeezing of my chest, the inability to breathe, choking on bubbles exploding around me. After that, Dad insisted on teaching me how to swim. 

Like me, he’d always been fascinated with water, so he refused to have a child who couldn’t swim. Before my older brother and I were even born, he enrolled us in lessons. Harvey was five years older than me, so he could already swim. Dad wanted to take me to the sea, though I was more comfortable in the pool.

However, my swimming classes were short-lived (I barely learned how to keep my head afloat) when Dad left in the middle of the night and never came back. But… neither did my brother.

I woke up around midnight to Mom hysterically crying. I discovered the next morning that Dad had taken my brother hookah diving without proper equipment, and Harvey was in the emergency room. 

Initially, I was told my brother was very sick, which, obviously, I believed. 

I was playing Sonic with my brother only yesterday! In my head, he was just sick in the hospital.

I spent the day expecting him to drag himself into my bedroom at any time, knock something over, call me a name, and run away. But the house was empty. 

Mom didn't come out of her room. 

Not even to take me to school. Instead, I watched Cartoon Network all day. I poked my head in my brother’s room, and it was a noticeable mess, clothes strewn everywhere and a half-packed suitcase.

When I asked to see Harvey a few days later, Mom told me he was dead.

Brain-dead, at least.

She explained it the best she could, choking on her own words.

Harvey had gone too deep, and when trying to resurface, his blood had bubbles and his brain had popped.

I don’t think she was mentally okay enough to explain to her nine-year-old daughter that her brother was dead. 

Yeah, no, considering she used our soda stream and a grape to demonstrate the accident with a hysterical smile on her mouth, almost like she thought it was funny. I didn't find it funny. 

Watching the bubbles in the water and my mother pop a grape between her index and thumb with a huge grin on her face was actually fucking traumatising. 

I know people grieve in their own way. Even as a kid though, I was confused when my brother didn’t get a funeral. 

Dad did come back, but only to try and justify his trip with Harvey. He said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that he was just doing what was best for his kids.

I already despised him for taking my brother away, but the way he talked about him, insisting that “Harvey loves the water!” made me want to scream. 

He was *wrong.* While I was obsessed with water, my brother had steered away from it, especially the sea. Mom called him a psycho and threw him out.

Dad moved to the other side of town, and it was just Mom and me once again.

For a long time, I hated my father. I ignored his letters, calls, texts, and the mermaid figurines he sent me for my birthday. I didn’t understand grieving, and worse, post-grieving.

Did such a thing exist? 

I understood that I was sad, and sometimes I was happy—before feeling guilty for catching myself smiling. 

I missed him, so I got a diary. I wrote to my brother, telling him everything and nothing, sometimes just what I did that day, or telling him how mom was.

I started attending group therapy. 

One girl said she forgave her father for killing her mother in a car crash but her words became entangled in my mind, frustrating me, bleeding into confusion and anger I  couldn't control. 

How could she forgive something like that? I asked her after, and she shrugged and said, “It wasn't his fault.” 

“But it *was* my dad’s fault,” I told her, leaning forward in my chair. “He killed my brother.”

The girl, Mia, I think her name was (I could never read her name-tag– it was either Mia, or Mira) folded her arms, shooting me a glare. “Well, maybe you should forgive him.”

When I asked Mom in the car on the way home, she said the exact same thing. 

“It was an accident, Sadie,” Mom said. “Your father took your brother diving, and he wasn't ready.” She averted her gaze, her hands tightening around the wheel. “Harvey asked him to take him out during a storm.”

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. “But you said—”

She said Harvey didn't want to go diving.

There wasn't a storm that night. I would have heard it.

She said my brother hated the ocean, and he wanted no part of it.

Mom’s eyes darkened, and she opened her mouth like she was going to speak, before changing the subject, flicking on the radio. “Do you want to get takeout tonight?”

I wanted to question her, but I didn't even know what to ask.

But then I was questioning my own memories.

Did Mom say what I remembered, or did I mishear her?

It took me a long time to realize maybe Harvey's death wasn't Dad’s fault after all.

After a while of therapy, and listening to other kids’ stories, I started to wonder if hating him was the right thing to do. 

Mom was talking to him civilly, at least. The two of them met for coffee every Saturday, and Mom seemed like she had genuinely forgiven him. 

The other kids asked me if my Mom was *over* Harvey’s death. But I guess laughing was inappropriate. “Grieving is an individual emotion!” Mr. Prescott, our therapist, kept saying, when I was on my knees giggling into the prickly carpet. 

Was my mother over my brother’s death? *Yes, of course she was!* 

That's what I told my friends, who I made sure stayed far away from our house. 

Mom was *fine*, I told everyone. 

She was completely fine, and definitely *not* slowly losing her mind, insisting on buying a giant aquarium for her room and named her new pet flounder fish Harvey. 

*Mom isn't crazy*, I told myself, which became my mantra. 

She just had her own way of grieving. 

Besides, I did like Harvey. 

He was pretty cool for a fish, always waiting for me behind the glass when I got home from school. 

*Mom isn't crazy.*

That's what I told myself (again) when I caught her opening the tank and trying to fish Harvey out of the water to hold him. Unlike other fish though, he didn't freak out or squirm, instead staying cupped in her hands. 

So, no, I finally admitted to my therapy class, bursting into tears. 

Mom definitely *wasn't* over my brother. I was eleven years old, and my mother was on the brink of a breakdown. 

She worked all day every day, and on weekends all she talked about was either work, or Harvey the fish, often pausing so *he* could join in conversations.

Sometimes, she asked him, “How's school?” 

I had to quietly remind her that the fish wasn't actually my brother. 

I needed something– someone– normal. 

I found ‘normal’ in the family pool, enveloping myself in my comfort zone. 

Over the years, I taught myself how to swim, envisioning my tail again. 

In my mind, I could swim away from my family, and never go back. 

Unfortunately, I was old enough to know mermaids weren't real.

The only connection I *did* have with the ocean was with Harvey.

Dad called every day inviting me to visit. 

I always declined. I wasn't interested in his shiny new life. Dad was an architect, and had designed his own house by the sea. 

I ignored him until my twelfth birthday, when he sent a text which just said, **“Happy Birthday, pumpkin! I have a surprise for you, but you're going to have to come see it yourself. Our door is always open, Sadie. You're going to love them!”**

I wasn't exactly ecstatic. 

Dad’s new girlfriend, who was half his age, smelled like red tide when she came to visit, and I wasn't looking forward to the awkward conversation I would be having with my father. If I'm honest, though, part of me was intrigued by the photos Mom showed me. 

So, ignoring my therapist, who said, “Just give it a little more time,” I rode my bike to his beach house after school.

Dad’s place teetered on the sea, designed to blend with the ocean itself. 

On the edge of a cliff, with grandiose pillars (which were way too much), lay my father’s house, cut off from the rest of the town, and definitely showing off his wealth. 

I wasn't expecting it to be so modern. French doors leading me inside sported beta fish carvings, an axolotl in a fifty gallon tank greeting me with its trademark smile. I was hesitant at first. 

If I fully walked inside, I wouldn't be able to leave without having a painful conversation with my father.  

But running away seemed childish—even for a soon to be twelve year old.

I admit, I was impressed. 

If *these* were the lengths he'd gone to get my attention, well, he had me hook, line, and sinker. Dad had designed his house to resemble an aquarium. 

The hallway was illuminated with a soft blue light, every wall a different tank filled with a variety of fish. It was almost like being in real-life Animal Crossing. 

Farther down, glass floors mimicked the deep ocean, filled with tiny flounder swimming below.

I've always been afraid of heights, so stepping on flooring resembling the deep ocean, twisted my gut, and yet filled me with exhilaration. Like stepping across an underwater world. It was both beautiful, and *way* over the top. But that was Dad’s mo. 

We always had to have the *best* pool when I was a kid. 

“Sadie?” Dad’s voice startled me when I was staring, transfixed by everything around me. I didn't know what to look at first. Everything was *water* themed. 

Even the stairs. It was pretty, sure, but it didn't look *lived* in. The walls were filled with fish, a beautiful display of marine life showcased on every corner. I found myself pressed up against schools of nemo fish spiralling in scarlet streams, stealing away my breath. Beautiful. 

But there was nothing that made this house a home– stained coffee cups and magazines strewn all over the floor. 

That was Mom’s house. 

Dad’s was more like a museum. 

I was intrigued by the kitchen lit up in a bioluminescent glow, slowly inching towards it, when Dad’s voice came again.

This time, from underneath me. “I'm in the basement, sweetie!”

I had half a mind to run. It hit me that I didn't want to see my father, I just wanted to see my surprise. The teenage brain is selfish, but I had my reasons. 

Still, though, I found myself drawn to the basement, my sneakers making smacking noises down the steps. 

Unlike upstairs, the lower levels of Dad’s house were yet to be renovated. 

Thinking of the death star, there was no stair rail. My hands grazed cold brick walls, before darkness became ocean blue, like walking on the seafloor. 

The low hum of a filtration system cut through the silence, my steps quickening. 

The basement was not what I was expecting; a simple room with one singular tank. 

The stink of seawater and bleach drowned my nose and throat, both clinical and otherworldly, forcing my legs further. Dad stood in front, grinning beneath a banner saying, “Happy 12th birthday!”

I was already taking steps forward, my body in control of my mind. 

The tank was darker than the others, tiny green lights at the bottom illuminating clear water. 

I could barely register Dad’s words, my gaze glued to the glass. 

His voice sounded like ocean waves crashing against the shore, wading in and out of my ears. “I asked my friends for a favor,” he said. “They specialise in marine research, and…well, during their last expedition, they found something incredible, Sadie.” 

Dad’s grin was contagious, and in three strides, I was pressing my face against the glass. I don't know what I was expecting. Was it a new species of fish? 

“They're shy.” Dad hummed. “Just stay there, and they'll come over to you.”

I found my voice strangled in my throat, my skin prickling with goosebumps. *“They?”*

Something warm expanded in my chest when a face appeared behind the glass—a beautiful girl with long dark hair haloing around her, tiny points on her ears and strange rugged skin. But it wasn't her face I was mesmerised by. 

Yes, she was hypnotising, every part of her seemed to glow, wide green eyes and a glittering smile. I staggered back, a cry clawing at my throat, when I realized she didn't have legs. Instead, a long blue tail was moulded to her torso, each scale intricate and sparkling. 

The skin below her breast was rugged, slits carved into her flesh.

*Gills.*

This couldn't be happening, I thought, dizzily. 

I was staring at a real life mermaid. 

She was so pretty, graceful, gently tapping on the glass, playing an invisible piano with her fingers. 

I was joining in, laughing when the mermaid pressed her fingertips against mine, when movement came behind her, a shadow looming into view. 

It was a boy this time, dark brown hair billowing around him adorned with seaweed, a green tail in place of legs. There was a noticeable scar on his throat. 

It made me wonder if a fish had attacked him. The merman was different. Unlike his female companion, he *wasn’t* smiling, instead folding his arms and refusing to meet my gaze. When he accidentally made eye contact, he turned and flicked his tail in my face, hiding behind the girl. 

Dad laughed. “The male is quite standoffish. Don't worry, he's like that with everybody. He wasn't easy to catch.”

I could barely speak, staring at the girl, who waved, her smile broadening. 

“Uh-huh.” I managed to choke out. 

I didn't notice my father wrapping his arms around me. His touch felt foreign and wrong, but also comforting. 

I hadn't hugged him in so long. I found myself missing him, and the conversation I wanted to have, all of those poisonous words in my throat, contorted into childish squeals of joy. “They're yours, Sadie,” Dad murmured into my hair. 

“I have a deal where I can keep them here for observation, but they're officially *yours*.”

“Mermaids.” I said. 

Dad nodded. “Well, the scientific name for them is HAB, or human-like aquatic beings, but yes,” he chuckled, “They are mermaids.”

Dad paused, striding over to the tank. I noticed the male mermaid flinch, almost immediately swimming over to the glass, tapping his fingers against the pane. 

I joined him, raising my fingers while watching his dark brown curls fly around him, bubbles escaping his mouth when he parted his lips in what I *think* was a greeting. The points in his ears reminded me of fae, and I couldn't stop smiling. 

He looked so human, and yet these tiny details, like his ears, and narrow features, told me he *belonged* in the ocean.

I had dreamed of being able to breathe  underwater, and this boy was doing just that, staring at me with coffee brown eyes. When his head inclined slowly, I couldn't resist a giggle. 

I figured I looked pretty alien to him. 

Dad nudged me playfully. “We haven't figured out their language yet. We know it's quite similar to whales, or even dolphins. It's rare when they do speak, but it's beautiful, Sadie.” 

Dad’s eyes were wide. “It's almost like they're singing the melody of their world: the songs of their people.”

I prodded the glass, and the merman copied, his lips curling into a scowl. 

The female mermaid swam over, shoving him out of the way. 

She seemed more excited, following my fingers excitedly. 

“What do you think you're going to call them?” Dad hummed. 

I turned to him. “They don't have names?”

He shrugged, and then Dad’s expression was my father again, his eyes growing sad, like he remembered why I was here– and just like me, Dad didn't want to talk about my brother. Turning to face the mermaids, his smile faded. 

“They were originally named specimen one and two, but I don't think those names suit them.”

I met the girl’s eyes, and like a child, her smile broke out into a grin. 

While she was wide eyed and smiley, the male mermaid folded his arms, carefully tracking me with his gaze, lip curled, like he could sense me thinking up names. 

I traced the glass, the seaweed entangled in the boy’s hair almost resembling a crown. I half wondered, giddily, if the male was a Prince. 

“Falan.” I said, without thinking, and to my shock, he rolled his eyes. 

Dad cleared his throat. “The male seems to have remarkably similar characteristics to a human male,” he said, “His paperwork suggests he copies human expressions.”

I moved onto the girl, who was playful, tapping her fingers against the glass. 

“Aira.”

The girl nodded excitedly, copying my smile. 

Dad was hesitant this time to touch me, instead clapping me on the shoulder. “I think she likes her name,” he said, heading to the door. “Elle is making pasta, if you want to join us? No pressure, sweetie.”

Dad left me with the mermaids, and admittedly, the first thing I did was jump up and down like a, well, a twelve year old. 

I ate dinner with Dad and his girlfriend that  night, and I waited to have “the talk” but it never came. In fact, when I visited the following weekend, everything I wanted to tell him was suffocated by the beings in his basement. 

I spent hours with the two of them, talking to Aira about everything from school to my worries about my mother
She would nod and try to listen, her eyes wide, like she could understand me. 

I figured that wasn't the case when I lied and told her an asteroid was going to destroy the planet, and she nodded excitedly, lips spreading into a grin. 

Sometimes, she copied me. When I laughed, she did too– or she tried to. 

I don't think it was easy for her under the water. I started missing therapy sessions to spend time with the mermaids, but it was only Aira who engaged with me, always waiting for me when I arrived, sometimes asleep, curled up at the bottom of the tank. 

Falan, meanwhile, completely ignored me, instead spending all of his time either scowling at me, or closer to the surface. 

I caught him trying to swim up several times, only to dive back down, returning to his little spot to continue brooding. 

As I got older, I expected the mermaids to age, too. 

But instead, they seemed to be physically frozen around what looked like the ages of early twenties, judging from their looks. I turned thirteen, and I spent every summer and weekend with them. 

Dad told me to entertain them, try and get them used to human activities, so I introduced them to my phone, pressing it to the glass. 

While Aira seemed impressed (by literally everything), Falan did his signature eye roll, as if saying, *“Oh, wow, it's a weird device with a light! I've already seen one.”*

Dad did say the male mermaid was talented at mimicking human expression, so I figured Falan *had* seen a phone. 

So, in my quest to impress this stubborn merboy, I showed him a TV, and then my Nintendo 3DS. He didn't seem interested in the TV, but his eyes lit up when I showed him Pokémon. 

I think it was the bright colors, but his eyes seemed glued to the screen, following my little character. 

I made an unspoken pact with him. 

I showed him Pokémon, playing it with him every time I visited, and he stopped with the scowling and the rolling of the eyes. 

Falan didn't stop being an asshole, but every time I stepped into the basement, it was *him* who was waiting, eagerly, his face pressed against the glass. 

When he saw me, the merman leaned back, pretending he wasn't waiting for me. I showed him a new game, Zelda, and he surprised me with the smallest of smiles, his eyes glued to my screen. 

Aira sometimes joined us, but she grew bored easily, either falling asleep, or swimming up to the surface. 

After introducing him to video games, Falan was a lot more animated. 

I was fourteen when I dragged myself, once again, to Dad’s beach house. It was my first year of junior high, and I had nobody to talk to about the mermaids. 

When I visited them, Falan was on the surface, leaning against the side, his head comfortably nestled in his arms. 

I noticed the tank was open, so it must have been feeding time. 

Every day around 5pm, Dad opened up the tank, dropping in what looked like mutilated fish guts, and little flakes. 

Falan always ignored the food, while Aira immediately dove for fleshy entrails, stuffing them into her mouth. 

Falan needed a little coaxing, so Dad thrust a long metal pole into the water, gently nudging the merman towards the food. 

That day, there was no sign of my father, and both mermaids were on the surface. 

Falan, with his head in his arms, and Aira, looking lost, her eyes wide. 

It was the first time I had seen her without her excited little grin.

Falan must have sensed me, since his head jerked up when I dropped my backpack on the floor. 

This was the first time I'd seen him fully on the surface, but when he locked eyes with me, I realized he was panting, struggling to breathe, his fingers gingerly prodding at his throat. The air must have been hurting him, I thought.

He wasn't used to our air, so *why* was he so insistent on staying on the surface? 

*Stupid boy.* 

I made my way over to the tank, and to my surprise, he swam over, sticking his head over the side. 

Falan made a choking sound and I understood he was trying (and failing) to mimic our language. He tried again, his eyes strained, lips parting, but no words came out, only strange guttural noises I could almost mistake for words. 

This happened twice. 

The second time, the tank was half shut, but Falan broke the surface when he saw me come in, parted his lips, and tried to speak, seemingly frustrated with his inability to mimic human speech. He tried again, and this time l could see he was visibly struggling to stay on the surface. 

Aira, to my confusion, pulled him back under the water, and to me, pointed upwards. I did my best to communicate with her, just like dad told me. I had to speak with my hands instead of my mouth. 

“You want me to open the tank?” I said, motioning upwards. 

“Sadie.” 

Dad joined me, carrying a bucket full of entrails. 

He dumped the food in the tank and shut the lid all the way, flashing me a smile. 

“I know they're pretty to look at, but they're also dangerous.” he nodded to Falan, who ignored the food, instead pressed against the glass, glaring at my father. “These beings are carnivores, sweetie. I don't mean to scare you, but I don't think swimming with them would be a whole lot of fun.” 

I found myself nodding, watching sharp red dilute the depths, Aira snatching up tangled fish intestine. 

I watched her eat it, sharp incisors biting through a cloud of red obscuring my vision and spreading around her. 

The smile on her face no longer looked playful. She looked happy to be eating, and something ice cold trickled down my spine when her eyes met mine, this time not with curiosity, but something else entirely, something I was in denial of. 

After that day, I guess I started to grow up. The mermaids in my Dad’s basement were beautiful, yes, but all signs pointed to them also trying to lure me into their tank. Dad didn't say *they will eat you*, but he did supervise my visits from then on, making sure I kept my distance. 

The two of them didn't change, but my childhood fantasy of friendly fish people darkened to a more plausible reality. 

Falan and Aira were not my friends, nor were they my presents. 

I was the naive prey who was almost fish food. 

I stopped visiting after Falan started gesturing me inside their tank. 

I wanted nothing to do with them. 

Growing up, I still saw them during holidays. 

But the basement was filling up with other things, my dad's belongings and my toys from childhood. 

I saw them once before college, the two of them slamming themselves against the tank when I walked in. 

I couldn't tell if they were excited or hungry. Aira’s eyes were almost sad, her lips parting as if to say, *You left us*.

Falan tapped the glass, cocking his head. I noticed his scar was bigger. 

Maybe Dad accidentally caught it when he was coaxing the merman to his food. 

I think Falan knew it was a goodbye. 

He didn't understand the concept of college, and I wasn't going to try to explain it to him. 

I left them like that, and never went back. 

Over these years, I wondered if Dad had released them back into the sea. 

Ever since I left home at eighteen, I've been flying to and from college every couple of months, due to a respiratory condition that came out of nowhere. 

I thought it was the mold in my college dorms, but when I moved to another room, I still found myself waking up, choking on air, like my lungs refuse to work. 

Numerous scans informed me I'm completely healthy, and all the doctor can give me is an inhaler. I was supposed to meet with a specialist in town anyway, so I figured I would pay dad a visit.

I headed back to Dad’s beach house with the excuse to pick up some old  trinkets I left behind. 

There was no sign of him, so I let myself in, making my way down to the basement. 

Dad had changed the lighting to a duller blue, and immediately, I was comforted with the familiar stink of saltwater and strong bleach that smelled right. 

The stairs were *wet*, I noticed, slowly making my way down to the basement.

The tank was still there, illuminated in dazzling blue. 

But it was bigger. 

I saw Aira before she saw me, and I noticed a change in her. 

She wasn't smiling. 

Instead, the mermaid’s eyes were alert, her fingers tapping against the glass. 

“Hey.” I greeted her, a cough I couldn't control taking over. 

Aira jumped, startled, when I knocked on the glass. Her gaze found mine, and something twisted in my gut. 

Her expression was wild, contorted, and not what I remembered. 

When she pointed upwards for me to open the tank, I shook my head, biting back the urge to say, “Nice try.”

I could tell she hadn't eaten yet. The tank was fresh, so my dad was yet to feed them. 

“Where's Falan?” I asked, remembering how to talk with my expression. 

Aira didn't respond. With a stoic face, she pointed upwards again. 

The absurdity of me talking to my childhood mermaid friend sent me into fits of laughter– which became a coughing fit. 

When I spluttered out a cough, her eyes widened, and I swore her gaze flicked to my torso. With the mermaid mostly ignoring me, I went in search of my trinkets I left behind in one of the towering boxes filling the basement. 

I was looking for my music box, and an old mermaid figurine Harvey had given me for my fifth birthday. 

I found myself going through memory lane diving into boxes of old toys, and my endless collection of mermaid memorabilia. Shoving aside holiday decorations, I stuck my hands in another box, pulling out a folded yellow dress. 

The dress was cute, but I didn't remember wearing it. 

I thought maybe it was Elle’s, but it was way too small. Elle was a curvy woman. 

Throwing the dress aside, I pulled out cargo shorts this time. Followed by a short sleeved band shirt, and a lakers cap covered in dust. With the clothes in my hands, I had a sudden hysterical thought that these were my brother’s clothes. 

But he was dead. 

He died when I was nine years old. 

I could feel my hands starting to tremble, digging deeper into the box. 

This time, a backpack with a tiny Pikachu attached to the zipper. I went through it, pulling out workbooks and crumbled schedules, a bottle of water and a crumbling sandwich covered in mold. 

Opening the workbooks, I flicked through pages and pages of intricate handwriting. 

A stress toy was at the very bottom of the pack, collecting dust. 

I could sense my breathing starting to accelerate when my hands grasped a bright green handbag filled with make-up, a dead phone, and a laptop. 

But it was right at the bottom of the box, where I found the nail in the coffin that sent bile shooting up my throat. 

Two college ID’s. The first, neat and looked after, on a red string, belonged to a scowling twenty two year old English major, Matthew Whittam. 

The second ID tag, covered in scribbles and doodles, was twenty three year old Quinn Cartwright, a smiling brunette, who, according to her tag, was a film student. 

The tag slipped out of my hands, and I puked, heaving up my mediocre dinner.

Aira and Falan. 

The beings in the tank were not mermaids. They were HUMAN. 

Before I could stop myself, I grabbed the clothes again, the yellow dead with noticeable smears of red on the collar, and the cargo shorts torn and bloodied when I turned them inside out. 

I don't even remember standing up. 

With the ID tag in my hands, I stumbled over to the tank, pressing Aira’s identity against the glass. 

But she didn't even recognize herself, slowly cocking her head to the side. 

This hurt, a pang in my chest physically squeezing my lungs. 

This time, I opened the tank, and the girl broke the surface. 

She didn't speak, because she *couldn't*, instead flailing her arms. 

I thought back to the scar on Falan's throat, and I felt sick to my stomach. 

Instead of speaking, Aira pointed to the door, her eyes wide and desperate. 

“It's okay,” I told her calmly. “Where's Falan?”

When her eyes narrowed to slits, I caught myself. 

“Matthew.” I corrected, quickly. “Where is Matthew?”

Before she could respond, my father’s voice sounded from upstairs. 

Followed by what sounded like muffled screaming. 

Aira’s head snapped to me when the muffled screaming grew closer, my father’s footsteps following. 

I could hear the sound of something wet hitting concrete, like a tail. 

Aira pointed towards a box, and I understood, diving behind the door. 

The wet slapping noises continued, all the way down the stairs, before my father appeared, a bloody apron over jeans and a shirt, dragging along a figure. 

It was another guy, lying on his stomach, blood spilling from his lips and nose, streaking down his bare torso. 

I had to slap my hand over my mouth. I could still see the guy’s legs, or what used to be his legs, twisted into something resembling a tail. 

His ears still looked human, the sharp points almost looked man-made. 

Dad dragged the boy across the floor, panting. “It's okay,” he told the boy who was half human. The guy was struggling to breathe, like a fish out of water. “Once your lungs have gotten used to the water, you'll adapt.”

When he yanked the boy by his grotesque legs slowly morphing into a tail, the boy coughed up something that dripped down his chin. His eyes were wide and unseeing, his arms dead weights by his side. Dad carried the boy, bridal style, up a ladder to the surface. 

I thought he was going to throw him in, but instead, my father pulled out a knife. “It's okay,” he kept telling the guy in sharp breaths, “I know it hurts, but you won't be able to adapt if I don't do this.” 

I could see Aira watching, her hand over her mouth, as my father dragged the blade across the boy’s throat, slicing it open, and dumping him into the water. 

The boy sank, his body bent in an arch, sharp red blooming around him. 

He was dead. 

His tail was limp, his arms dragging him down. 

Aira caught the boy, cradling him in her arms. 

Dad watched, a smile pricking on his lips. 

The ‘merman’ jolted in Aira’s arms, his eyes shooting open, and when he breathed, he breathed by habit, clutching his chest, a stream of bubbles flying from his mouth. 

When the nameless boy caught hold of himself, he pounded his fists against the glass, lips parting in a silent cry. Dad ignored him, dumping fish guts into the water, and forcing him to eat them. 

It struck me why Falan and Aira were only alert when they didn't eat. 

My father was drugging their food, keeping them docile. 

He had cut their voices directly from their throat. 

Carved into their bodies, cruelly moulding them into my stupid fucking childhood fantasy. 

When my Dad left them, Aira tried to tell me to stay to help her calm down the new merman, who kept pounding his fists against the glass. 

But I think part of her wanted me to hunt down her companion. I knew from the panicked glances she kept sending me that she was worried for him. 

Dad said his office was out of bounds when I was a kid, and I never thought much of it. 

When I pushed through the door, which was surprisingly unlocked, I realized *why*. 

All around me, bathed in clinical white light, were towering tanks filled with both human and fish parts; floating torsos and severed heads, victims no longer with identities.

Dad was studying how to combine the two. His notes were strewn everywhere, screwed up and thrown in an overflowing trash can, and stuck to the wall. I found Falan pinned to a surgical table, a tube stuck down his throat. 

The human boy cruelly twisted into something *inhuman*, and yet my father was sadistic enough to continue the facade, leaving the seaweed entwined in his curls, like he was a circus act. 

There was a sensor above him, every movement he made setting off a sprinkler, soaking him. 

It was when he *didn't* move, which glued me to the spot. 

When his tail dried up, I panicked, reaching to wave my arm in front of the sensor. 

Instead, however, to my shock, his tail started to change, contorting and morphing into *something* that resembled legs, but were more grotesque, cruelly stitched to his torso in a horrific attempt to change from a mermaid into a human boy.

When the sensor activated, soaking him again, Falan’s body jerked, and he choked up splattered red splashing the tube.

His eyes flickered open, and he opened his mouth to speak.

But his words were gibberish, his voice a incomprensible hiss. 

I remembered how to move. 

Police. 

That was my first thought. 

I needed to get the cops. 

I tried to leave, stumbling over to the door, but something caught my eye. 

Another tank, and floating inside it, an all too familiar face. 

But he wasn't supposed to be so limp, so *wrong.*

Unmoving. 

Harvey's body had long since decomposed, and yet pieces of flesh still remained, still my big brother, and yet his body wasn't, cruelly ripped apart and stitched together, a mutilated fish tail attached to his torso. 

His skin was covered in mismatched scales, like a virus taking over, shredding him apart, only leaving a slimy, green tinged substance coating him. 

Harvey was dead. 

But the thing stitched to him, entangling decomposing flesh, was still *alive*. 

I got out of there, and then the house in four single breaths. 

I ran home.

I woke up yesterday unable to breathe, this time choking up blood. 

Mom wasn't there.

When I stepped into the shower, I pieced together my thoughts and what exactly I was going to tell the cops, without sounding crazy. 

But when my fingers grazed the skin of my torso, just below my breast, I could feel three singular gashes in my skin. 

Feeling the other side, there they were, splitting my flesh apart, warm to the touch, and yet somehow feeling natural. 

I can't believe I'm saying this, but being in water feels better. I can finally breathe. 

But I find myself stumbling when I'm trying to walk, and I'm terrified. 

I keep getting out of breath, and my skin feels too dry. Like it's sucked of moisture. 

I tried to get into the basement earlier, and unsurprisingly, it's locked. 

There's no sign of Mom or Dad. 

The only thing I have right now is Mom’s stupid pet fish. 

I feel like I'm suffocating on air. 

You have to help me.

Am I ridiculous for feeling hurt?,"I don't know how to really articulate the feelings I'm having about this, and I really wanted to get some reason talked into me.

I \[24F\] bought a sex toy for my boyfriend \[23M\], one of those transparent flesh light thingies, because I thought it would be a lot of fun experimenting with such a thing and kinda spice things up with a new toy. Anyway, it arrived a few days ago, but I was super busy and stressed with my university workload since I had an exam earlier today.

We just had sex at night like usual, and I put off using the toy because I really, really wanted to be mentally present 100%. I suggested to him that I didn't want him to use it without me previously. But I wanted to wait until I wasn't so stressed so I didn't give some half-assed sex-toy-job, and I guess I was just super excited and have been looking quite forward to it.

Anyway, I got home today, and he was at the gym, so I decided to check out the thing just to see how it really worked. When I put my finger in it, I realized it was recently washed. I texted him asking if he had used it already, to which he instantly admitted. I felt sort of gut-punched. Maybe this is super dramatic, but I sort of felt, I don't know, betrayed? I really wanted to experience or share this intimate moment for the first time together. I wouldn't have minded if it was afterward, but he deliberately chose to use it privately beforehand. It's kind of a selfish act to me. I wouldn't think to do the same to him since I'd want to wait for him to try out a new sex toy, especially if he has stated his excitement for it. 

I sent a sad face emoji, and he started apologizing profusely and stating how he felt bad. I decided to go out and get a little coffee just to take my mind off of it for a bit and kind of calm down my feelings surrounding it since I felt really disappointed. I really, really wanted to share that intimate moment together, and I felt like he was deliberately hiding it and knew that it would hurt my feelings, yet he chose to do so anyway. Like, if I didn't just happen to check it out, he would just pretend that it was this new experience shared together. I'm honestly surprised by how hurt I am by this situation. I just feel like since I had already told him not to, and my general excitement, and the fact he was sort of hiding it, and I don't know. Am I being ridiculous and making this too deep? I just feel really sad about the whole ordeal. :/

I'd love to hear your thoughts or receive some advice. I told him that I needed some space to just sort my mind out but I'm struggling to do that by myself. It's not like he cheated or anything but he is sorry only because he got caught. I just feel betrayed. Thank you.",0,1741143163.0,relationship_advice,17,0.17,False

1j3sy24,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/1j3sy24/the_venomous_vivian/,The Venomous Vivian,"The air in the café was thick with the aroma of coffee and the low hum of conversation. Marcus stirred his cappuccino absentmindedly, watching the rain drizzle against the window. Across from him, Elaine sat, her fingers curled around her mug, her expression a mix of sympathy and frustration.

“So, what now?” she asked, breaking the silence.

Marcus sighed, shaking his head. “I don’t know. I just wish I had seen through her sooner.”

Elaine didn’t have to ask who ‘her’ was. The specter of Vivian hung over their group like an unshakable shadow, a presence that Marcus had tolerated for far too long.

### **The First Betrayal**

It wasn’t always like this. Ten years ago, when Marcus first met Vivian, she had seemed warm, intelligent, and charming. She had a way of drawing people in, of making them feel special—until they no longer served a purpose.

The first real sign came when Marcus was going through a rough breakup. He had confided in their friend group, and while most were supportive, Vivian had reacted differently. At first, she played the role of the caring friend, offering advice and checking in on him. But soon after, Marcus learned that she had been spreading rumors behind his back—suggesting that he was emotionally unstable, that he had driven his ex away, that he was, in her words, ‘a wreck that no one should date.’

When Marcus confronted her, she laughed it off. “Oh, come on, Marcus. You know I’m just joking. Don’t be so sensitive.”

That was the first time he excused her behavior. It wouldn’t be the last.

### **The Ghosting Game**

Over the years, Vivian made a habit of disappearing whenever she pleased. She would engage in deep conversations, making Marcus feel valued—only to ignore his messages for weeks, even months, at a time. Then, just when he thought he had finally moved on, she would reappear with a casual “Hey! How have you been?” as if nothing had happened.

Marcus wasn’t the only one subjected to this treatment. She did it to others in their circle, but he was the only one who ever questioned it. Everyone else seemed to accept it, chalking it up to her ‘free spirit.’ But Marcus knew better. It was control. She wanted to dictate when and how she interacted with people, keeping them at arm’s length yet never truly letting them go.

### **The Wedding Sabotage**

When Marcus met Lydia, he knew she was the one. Their relationship moved fast, but it was real. When they decided to marry, Marcus extended an invitation to the entire friend group. Everyone responded with excitement—except for Vivian.

“I won’t be attending,” she had said bluntly.

Marcus was taken aback. “You don’t have to come if you’re busy, but—”

“Oh, it’s not that,” she interrupted. “I just don’t think you should invite me. It wouldn’t feel right.”

He should have let it go. But instead, he asked, “Why?”

Her response was chilling. “You know why.”

That was all she said before turning away. The next day, Marcus discovered that she had been privately messaging members of the group, insinuating that he was still seeing other women on dating apps—six months before his wedding. It was a lie, a complete fabrication. But it planted seeds of doubt. People started asking questions, whispering behind his back. Even Lydia, confident as she was in their relationship, was hurt that such rumors had even reached her ears.

Marcus had never felt more betrayed.

### **The Silent Resentment**

It dawned on Marcus then: this wasn’t about friendship. Vivian resented him. Perhaps it was because he had missed her wedding years ago due to work, despite his generous gift. Or perhaps she simply couldn’t stand to see him happy. Either way, her manipulation had reached its peak.

After the wedding, Marcus knew he had to cut ties. He blocked her on Facebook and WhatsApp—not in anger, but in self-preservation. He needed to be free from the toxicity she thrived on.

### **The Fallout**

The group’s reaction was mixed. Some understood, while others tried to dismiss it as a ‘misunderstanding.’

“She’s always been like this, Marcus,” one friend said. “You’ve just taken it too personally.”

Elaine was one of the few who saw the truth. “You’ve done the right thing,” she assured him. “You don’t owe her anything.”

Marcus nodded, staring out at the rain. He had lost years trying to maintain peace, excusing her behavior, pretending that the hurt she caused was accidental. But now, finally, he had clarity.

Vivian had spent years weaving a web of manipulation, but he was no longer caught in it. He was free.

### **A Marriage of Convenience**

Years later, Marcus heard whispers about Vivian’s life. She had married an average man—someone safe, reliable, but unremarkable. Some mutual friends speculated that she had done it out of love, but Marcus knew better. Vivian had spent years prioritizing control, her social image, and wielding influence over others. Deep down, she feared something more than anything else: being left behind.

As she approached her mid-thirties, the pressure of time became unbearable. The fear of growing old alone, of losing her perceived social value, had driven her to settle. It was a fate she had long mocked in others, but in the end, she had succumbed to it herself.

Marcus couldn’t help but feel a twinge of pity. Not because she had married someone she didn’t truly love, but because, for the first time in her life, she was the one who had compromised. And for someone like Vivian, that was the worst fate of all.

Managing diabetes is crucial for preventing long-term complications, such as heart disease, kidney failure, and blindness. Although many people continue to enjoy foods that are delicious, some of these may raise blood sugar levels and interfere with insulin function, which can make diabetes control nearly impossible. In this guide, I will outline the 10 worst foods that people with diabetes should avoid to ensure they maintain better control over their blood sugar levels and overall health.

# 1. Sugary Beverages

Sugary drinks, including sodas, sweetened iced teas, and fruit juices, are some of the worst offenders when it comes to diabetes management. These beverages are packed with refined sugars, which cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. For example, a 12-ounce can of cola contains about 40 grams of sugar. When consumed in excess, sugary drinks can contribute to insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, and increased belly fat. The high fructose content in these drinks further exacerbates these issues, raising cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which increases the risk of heart disease.

A much better alternative is to drink water, flavored with a slice of lemon, or unsweetened herbal teas. These options are virtually calorie-free and do not cause harmful blood sugar spikes.

# 2. Trans Fats

Trans fats are artificially created fats found in many processed foods, including margarine, packaged snacks, frozen dinners, and baked goods like cookies and crackers. These fats are added to increase the shelf life of products, but they are highly detrimental to your health. Trans fats have been linked to increased inflammation, insulin resistance, and higher levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, which further heightens the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

To avoid trans fats, check the ingredient list for ""partially hydrogenated oils."" If you see this, it's a sign that the product contains trans fats, and it's best to avoid it.

# 3. White Bread, White Rice, and White Pasta

Refined carbohydrates such as white bread, white rice, and white pasta are high on the glycemic index, meaning they cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. These foods have been stripped of fiber and nutrients, which are essential for slowing the absorption of sugars. While they might taste delicious, they offer very little nutritional value and can contribute to insulin resistance over time.

Switching to whole-grain alternatives, such as whole-wheat bread, brown rice, or whole-grain pasta, can provide more fiber and help to stabilize blood sugar levels. You can also try using cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles for a lower-carb, high-fiber alternative.

# 4. Flavored Yogurts

Although yogurt can be a healthy option for individuals with diabetes, flavored yogurts—especially those with fruit added—can be packed with added sugars. A typical serving of fruit-flavored yogurt contains about 60% of its calories from sugar, which can cause significant blood sugar spikes. Even ""low-fat"" or ""non-fat"" versions are often loaded with sugar to make up for the lack of creaminess.

Opting for plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt is a much better choice. It contains less sugar and more protein, helping to keep blood sugar levels in check and provide a feeling of fullness for longer.

# 5. Breakfast Cereals with Added Sugar

Many breakfast cereals, even those marketed as ""healthy,"" are loaded with added sugars and refined carbohydrates. A bowl of cereal may contain more than 40 grams of carbs, and some varieties contain only a small amount of protein, which is essential for stabilizing blood sugar levels. Consuming these cereals can lead to a quick blood sugar rise and poor diabetes management.

Instead of sugary cereals, opt for a protein-based breakfast, such as eggs, Greek yogurt, or a smoothie made with unsweetened almond milk, protein powder, and low-carb fruits.

# 6. Flavored Coffee Drinks

Fancy coffee drinks like caramel macchiatos or vanilla lattes from popular coffee shops can be dangerous for people with diabetes. These beverages are often sweetened with syrups and whipped cream, adding a significant amount of sugar and carbohydrates.

Instead of these sugary drinks, stick with black coffee, and consider adding a small amount of heavy cream or unsweetened almond milk for flavor. If you need a sweetener, opt for stevia or monk fruit.

# 7. Maple Syrup, Honey, and Agave Nectar

Although these sweeteners are often marketed as ""natural"" alternatives to refined sugar, they still contain high amounts of sugar that can spike blood sugar levels. Maple syrup, honey, and agave nectar are all examples of sugars that offer little in terms of fiber or nutritional value. Like table sugar, these sweeteners can contribute to weight gain, insulin resistance, and poor blood sugar control.

It is best to avoid these sweeteners altogether and use small amounts of low-glycemic sweeteners like stevia or monk fruit when you need a sweet taste.

# 8. Dried Fruits

While fresh fruits are generally a healthy choice for people with diabetes, dried fruits are another story. When the water is removed from fruits like raisins, apricots, and dates, their sugar content becomes more concentrated. A small serving of dried fruit can contain several times more sugar and carbs than its fresh counterpart. For example, one cup of raisins contains the equivalent sugar of four cups of fresh grapes.

Fresh fruits such as berries, apples, and pears are lower in sugar and have a higher water content, making them a better choice for maintaining blood sugar control.

# 9. Packaged Snacks

Pre-packaged snacks like pretzels, chips, and crackers often contain refined flour and have a high glycemic index, which can quickly raise blood sugar levels. These snacks are also often processed and lack fiber, which is essential for slowing down sugar absorption. Many packaged snacks also contain hidden sugars and unhealthy fats, which can worsen insulin resistance and contribute to weight gain.

Instead of reaching for packaged snacks, try a handful of almonds or other nuts, a piece of cheese, or some cut-up vegetables with hummus for a healthier, blood sugar-friendly option.

# 10. French Fries

French fries, a popular fast-food side dish, are packed with refined carbs and unhealthy fats, especially when deep-fried in oils. Potatoes themselves are high in carbs, and deep-frying them creates harmful substances that can increase inflammation in the body. Studies have linked the consumption of fried foods like French fries to an increased risk of heart disease and cancer, in addition to worsening diabetes management.

If you love potatoes, consider healthier alternatives like sweet potatoes or parsnips. Both are lower in carbs and have a lower glycemic index, making them better options for managing blood sugar.

# Conclusion

Managing diabetes involves making informed decisions about what you eat. Avoiding these 10 foods—sugary beverages, trans fats, refined carbohydrates, flavored yogurts, sugary cereals, flavored coffee drinks, natural sweeteners like honey, dried fruits, packaged snacks, and fried foods—can help you maintain better blood sugar control, reduce your risk of complications, and improve your overall health. While it might be tempting to indulge in these foods, doing so can make diabetes management a lot harder and increase the risk of developing more serious health issues.

Instead, focus on whole, minimally processed foods that are rich in fiber, healthy fats, and lean proteins. By making these changes, you'll be on your way to better blood sugar control and a healthier life.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I had a brief relationship with a girl (F30) for about 6 months from summer 2023 onward. I loved this woman so much. She made me so happy and made me feel seen in ways I could have never fathomed. I like to think during the good times, I did the same for her. She told me repeatedly she’s never been able to be herself with someone like she had with me. However, over that brief time together, I became overworked, burnt out, depressed, and my insomnia (amongst other health issues) starting acting up again. 

A bit of background context: she had an issue with me smoking weed due to her past trauma involving the drug. I would take a few tokes off a vape before bed to unwind, and was open about this from the first time we met, so I didn’t expect to change my behaviours. Over time, she wanted me to do it less and less. Initially this was fine, but by the time my insomnia was taking over, I needed to rely on it as a sleep aid. I told her as much, and this started our downfall.

Soon, we were fight about the weed smoking every time she saw me. I naturally withdrew, not wanting to be around her cause it led to fighting and stress, and I was already burnt out. She was upset that I was withdrawing from the relationship. That led to more and more resentment. 

After 6 months, I was severely depressed, my burnout had worsened even more, and I was becoming su!c!dal. I’m not happy about how dark things got, but I knew it was bad. We mutually broke up then, as I wasn’t able to improve on my weed smoking, though we left the door open for further communication and potentially getting back together. I was so depressed at the time that I couldn’t fathom being with anyone (or continuing to live), but I know she wanted to get back together for a lot of it. We met up a few times, some resulting in more fighting, others being truly cherished moments for the two of us. 

Ultimately, 9 months after the breakup, I wasn’t doing any better. I was scared that I was holding her back, and I made it clear to her that I feared her waiting around for me while I fail at having a happy life. She took those words to heart and moved on. However, a few weeks later, after a serious medical procedure, I texted her while I was waking up from the general anesthesia. She was angry at first, really upset that I was sending her loving sentiments a few weeks after her expressing the finality of the relationship. It led to a big fight, where she ultimately spent the night. It felt so good to have her in my arms again. To hear her say she loved me again.

But after that night, I reminded her I was still smoking pot in the evenings and she blew up at me. Told me she didn’t want to date me because of it. I told her I could stop, but she was past that. I was crushed. Two weeks later, I reached out pleading to be with her again, and she reamed me out. I cried and begged for her to take me back. It got ugly, and she was vocal that I was acting like a pathetic mess. Told me to never talk to her again, told me that in the span of those two weeks, she was already in a new relationship, told me she didn’t want to be with me, and said some piercing insults. She told me to delete her number.

I ultimately had a lot of failures on my end in this relationship. I didn’t compromise on the weed, I withdrew, and often wasn’t able to listen to her to the degree a boyfriend should. I recognize I fucked up. But it’s been two months since the last time we spoke and all I can think about day-in/day-out is her. I dream about her, wake up thinking of her, and spend all day every day missing her. It’s been 2.5 months since we last spoke, and almost a year since the official breakup. 

I miss her so much, and love her so much. Especially now that I'm less depressed and can feel the extent of my feelings. I write her letters every day, though I would never send them so as not to bother her. I miss her so much. She was the light of my life; in those brief moments with her, I truly felt like I had a soulmate, and I miss that. But I also know many people would look at that much fighting and say otherwise.

Ultimately, I’m struggling moving on. I quit weed the day we last spoke, and spent the last 2.5 months really working on myself. My burnout is gone, my depression is better and I have the tools to better manage it, and I am really living in accordance with my values. 

Here’s the issue: I really want to reach out to ask her to go for coffee to catch up. Yes I’d love to be with her again, but I don’t have that expectation. I just want to see her again, see her smile and laugh, and be in her presence once more. And get closure, so that if we truly can’t be together, my last memory of her isn’t her spewing insults at me. But I worry it would be an intrusion. If she’s actually with someone new, I don’t want to mess with her head. If she’s not, she may still hate me and not want to hear from me.

I installed the Yellow dating app back in February what can I say? It’s both overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time.

What do I mean by that? nakakoverwhelm na I matched 20+ women which is cool but I don’t have a lot of time in a day to reply right away. Underwhelming kase umabot ako ng ganon kadaming matches yet sobrang bland majority ng response nila, I always try to be engaging and interactive how I construct my questions and approach naman.
(Pero parang nafefeel ko most of the women sa dating app had a recent break up or still trying to move on, pero ending di pa talaga sila fully healed) IDK I might be wrong or baka ako talaga ung problema hahaha.

I dated 3 women out of those numbers naman kahit papaano. Typical fine dine date, coffee and get to know more. They were all great, stable profession, good-looking, may value. Pero andun ung feeling ko na parang pilit lang lahat.

Iba padin talaga ung feeling na organically mo na meet ung tao at dumaan kayo sa due process lol. Ung tipong hindi mo hinahanap pero dumating na lang. Ganon ko kase nakilala ung dati ko eh, parang gut feeling mo na lang magsasabi na ahh ayan na yun.

Masaya naman ako right now lalo na sa achievements ko sa career and finances. Pero ibang iba talaga ang feeling na may kasama ka sa journey mo habang nagsusucceed ka noh?You get to share your wins with someone you love.

It’s probably gonna take some time din talaga to find that someone. Date to marry naman ang mindset ko I’m not into playing mind games at urong sulong. But I guess I’m gonna be single for a while or worst just be a cool single tito na lang din hahays.

I was worried about the age gap so have been taking it slow, but could see something building here. It's still new, but going well, interesting and varied dates both going out and about, events, for dinner, and we've spent time at our respective houses.

We spent all day Saturday together, I stayed at hers and we were making plans for this Thursday. She's now asked me to get coffee after work at a chain place (impersonal and low effort), we have never had a coffee date and this seems like a big step back in the type of dates we've had previously. To me this seems like she is going to break up with me, am I reading too much into it?

This is my first time dating after having my heart broken last year - I took some time to really work on myself after that but I guess I'm feeling insecure. My ex blindsided me and I just don't want go into another situation like that so want to be prepared for the conversation. ",2,1741141395.0,relationship_advice,9,0.75,False

Title: Blinking Lights Above Los Angeles on January 1st

**Time:** January 1, 2025, around 12:50 PM PST  
**Location:** Echo Park, Los Angeles, California

*Processing video jm8d2yj4wkhe1...*

I was walking home with a coffee in hand, passing through an alley behind my apartment, when I noticed a large flock of birds circling above my apartment building. As I looked up to check them out, I immediately saw three *very* bright lights high above them, just hanging there in the sky.

As soon as I spotted the lights, the birds scattered.

The lights didn’t make any sense. They were in sort of a triangle formation and moving slowly but definitely weren’t helicopters or airplanes. All three were blinking—very noticeably.

After watching for a while, I headed inside, grabbed my binoculars, and went back out. Through the binoculars, it seemed like they had some sort of shape, sorta pointy. My first thought was something shaped like the *lunar lander*—bright, shiny, and with angles and points.

I was trying to see if maybe they were objects that were rotating and reflecting the sun's light as they did so, but through the binoculars the blinking was even more intense. It was a distinct *ON / OFF / ON / OFF* like a blinker. And extremely bright.

I watched for maybe five minutes? Mostly with my naked eye or through binoculars. At some point, I decided to try filming, but because of the bright daylight, I couldn’t see my phone screen at all—so I had no idea if I was actually capturing anything. I just pointed the camera in the general direction and hoped for the best.

These lights continued to move around slowly. Eventually, two of them started to move away while one remained, and I just stopped watching and went inside.

I checked flight trackers and didn’t see any activity in the area, but maybe I converted to UTC incorrectly? Still, they obviously weren't planes or helicopters. I had no idea what I was looking at.

1j3sfgg,https://i.redd.it/y4jgei166sme1.jpeg,"""The Great Pretender""","---


Reen was known for her radiant smile. At work, she laughed at every joke, always had a kind word to say, and made everyone feel important. Her presence was warm, comforting—like a flickering candle in a dark room. People gravitated toward her energy, admiring her ability to always see the bright side.


Her social media told the same story. Bright photos of coffee dates, sunsets, and joyful moments filled her feed, each caption carefully crafted to show a life of happiness and gratitude. She often received messages from friends and acquaintances saying, “You’re such a positive person!” or “I wish I had your happiness.”


But none of them knew the truth.


Behind the smile was a woman who felt nothing.


At home, in the quiet of her small apartment, the facade crumbled. The warmth in her eyes faded as she stared at the ceiling, listening to the ticking of the clock. The world outside continued to move, but inside, she felt frozen in place. She wasn’t unhappy because of one specific tragedy—there was no great heartbreak, no devastating loss. It was just the exhaustion of pretending. The pressure to always be okay.


Some nights, she would sit in front of the mirror, forcing a smile, watching as her own reflection became unrecognizable. The act had become second nature, but there was no joy behind it—only muscle memory.


She had fooled everyone, even herself at times. But at night, when there was no one to perform for, the loneliness crept in.


It wasn’t that she didn’t have people who cared. She had friends, coworkers, and a best friend, Blam, who always checked in on her. But Reen was good at deflecting, turning conversations away from herself, redirecting them with jokes and compliments. No one ever pried too much—except Blam.


One evening, after another long day of forced smiles and empty conversations, Reen sat across from Blam at their favorite café. The hum of background chatter and the clinking of cups filled the air. Blam studied her closely, stirring her coffee absentmindedly before saying, “You don’t have to be happy all the time, you know.”


The words hit her harder than she expected.


Reen froze, her fingers tightening around her cup. She wanted to brush it off, to laugh and say something witty, but no words came. Her throat felt tight, and before she could stop herself, her eyes burned with tears.


Blam didn’t press her. She simply reached across the table, placing a hand over Reen’s, grounding her in that moment.


For once, she didn’t fight it.


That night, she allowed herself to feel. To acknowledge the sadness, the exhaustion, the truth. She sat on her bed with the lights off, letting the weight she had carried for so long settle in her chest. It wasn’t easy—she had spent years building this image, convincing herself and everyone around her that she was okay.


But in that small moment of honesty, something inside her shifted.


Maybe she didn’t have to pretend forever. Maybe, just maybe, real happiness would come—not as a performance, but as something real.


She didn’t have all the answers yet. She didn’t know how long it would take or what healing would even look like. But for the first time in a long time, she let herself breathe.


And in that breath, there was hope.

The audacity! I couldn’t believe it. After that he promised Callie that they were gonna go on a coffee date and then he went to support Izzie on that surgery for donating bone marrow. Its like he doesn’t even think about Callie, she isn’t his priority, she is the last thing on his mind.

1j3se30,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1j3se30/embarrassed_during_date/,Embarrassed during date,"I am an active dater. I rarely disclose I have a GI condition on a first date - it's not necessary if we're only getting drinks. I went on a spur of the moment date on Sat and we hopped around a few locations before getting food but I managed bc I found a burger and got it plain so no issues and easy to work around. (Beef doesn't bother me but chicken thighs do which I will never understand.)

However, I went out tonight and we were supposed to get coffee but then the guy wants to get dumplings and I said I don't like dumplings, which isn't true but I don't want to explain I can't eat them bc of the carrots and cabbage. So we get tacos and he wants something to 'share' and he keeps proposing more stuff I can't eat so I say the steak is fine trying to get out of explaining I have something wrong w/ me. Then the tacos come out with cucumber, which I can't eat unless it's w/ no skin or seeds bc it will tear up my colon and I asked if he could eat them. Then he starts asking if I have allergies or don't like them bc now I look like a PITA being picky about food. I tried explaining I have a GI condition but I was so embarrassed by everything bc I don't think he got it at all. I don't expect people to understand everything but I felt so trapped explaining something personal to this guy I really don't like and don't want to see again. I usually like to have a heads up on food so I can check out the menu and felt kind of caught off guard bc I couldn't prepare at all. Sorry I'm rambling. I'm not upset but feel so embarrassed.

I’m training for an 8K and half marathon and looking to build my miles during the week/weekend. I’d love to find a women’s running group or connect with some like-minded running buddies to keep things fun and social!

A little about me—I’m 33 (she/her), single, liberal, and work for UW as a therapist. Outside of running, I’m a yogi, creative, music lover, and breakfast sandwich enthusiast.

I haven’t come across a women’s-only running group yet—does one exist? Or would anyone be interested in meeting up for casual/social runs? Open to different paces and distances, generally around a 11:00 pace. Maybe we treat ourselves to a good breakfast or coffee after? ",5,1741140904.0,madisonwi,2,0.78,False
