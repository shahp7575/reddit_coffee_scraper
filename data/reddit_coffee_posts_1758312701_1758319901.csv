1nlgyql,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketMoneyOfficial/comments/1nlgyql/feature_friday_budgeting/,Feature Friday: Budgeting,"Helping you spend less and save more without bothering with spreadsheets is one of the best parts about the Rocket Money app. Today’s Feature Friday is going to take a look at our budgeting capabilities.

Rocket Money makes budgeting easy by ditching the spreadsheet and automatically tracking and organizing your expenses. You can get a budget quickly set up, just the way you need it, and the app will keep track of how you’re doing over time.

**Setting Transaction Rules Makes Organizing Easy**

Do you consider your pre-work coffee runs part of your grocery budget or your dining out budget? With a transaction rule, you can teach the app to recognize certain things like transaction names or amounts and update the transaction automatically to make organizing a breeze. Personalize your experience with transaction rules that automatically categorize those recurring coffee purchases exactly how you want them.

**Custom Budgets Allow You to Tailor Your Budget to Fit Your Needs**

A lot of budgets have an Entertainment category, but sometimes that’s not specific enough. Say you like video games. New games are coming out all the time, your favorite multiplayer game adds new content, and then there’s that online subscription for your console. Rocket Money allows you to set custom categories so that you can make your budget fit you. You can even set custom limits and reminder alerts so you can avoid buying too many games at the seasonal sale.

**Ignored Categories Gives You More Accurate Spending Information**

Rocket Money automatically ignores things like credit card payments, money transfers between accounts, and reimbursements from your spending total so that you know how much you’re really spending.

Is there another Rocket Money feature you’d love to get more tips and tricks about? Let us know, and you may see it on our next Feature Friday!",1,1758319717.0,RocketMoneyOfficial,0,1.0,False

I’m Skylar (or Dole). I’ve been playing D&D for over a decade, usually stuck in the “forever DM” seat, which I don’t mind since I genuinely enjoy running games. I’m 24, a recent psychology graduate, into kickboxing, coffee, and music.

* **Commitment**: Long-term campaign (aiming for 1+ year of real-time play)
* **Cost**: **Free** (just show up and have fun!)
* **Platform**: Discord
* **Schedule**: Sunday 7:30-10:30PM EST (Up to change)

# What I’m Looking For

* Players who want to stick with their characters for the long haul.

That’s not sustainable, and it puts you in the category of someone freeloading off everyone else’s contributions. Certainly not a ""Champion""

Think about it: servers cost money to maintain, developers need to be paid for their ongoing work, and design updates don’t just happen magically.

If you’re not contributing anything beyond a single purchase from years ago, you’re effectively a freeloader, begging today’s actual paying subscribers to cover the bill for your continued usage.

Why should current Plus subscribers—people actively funding the service—have to subsidise indefinite free access for those who made a one-time purchase almost a decade ago? It’s not about being unfair, it’s about recognising that technology and app ecosystems evolve. Ongoing costs require ongoing revenue.

A Plus subscription costs around $40 per year (and it’s regularly on sale for much less). That breaks down to roughly **$3.30 per month**—about the price of a coffee. Is that really too much to ask for a high-quality app that, let’s be honest, many of you are using daily and getting considerable value from?

Nobody likes ads, but if you want sustainable, high-quality development without ongoing subscriptions, advertising is one of the few models that allows that.

Otherwise, you either accept that the app becomes stagnant and eventually unusable, or you acknowledge that your historical one-off payment isn’t enough to support endless growth and free server use forever.",2,1758319420.0,pocketcasts,0,0.57,False

I don’t really have trouble grabbing a coffee with friends in the evening, but I avoid bigger events—parties, celebrations, nights out—because I can’t drink while on meds, and with IBS it just feels impossible to enjoy myself. Alcohol used to make my anxiety disappear and boost my confidence, so without it I feel like I can’t have a good time.

So I usually stay home, but then I end up feeling super lonely and like I’m sabotaging myself—even when my boyfriend is literally sleeping next to me. It’s such a weird cycle.

Sometimes I want to go out, but the thought only hits me once everyone already has plans. If I tried to plan ahead, I know I’d cancel from the anxiety anyway. And to top it off, my friends will send me sweet little videos or voice notes when they hear a song I love at a party… which should make me feel included, but instead it makes me feel even more left out.

Looking for potential business/founding partners in the greater Roanoke area.  
  
I moved from Germany to Roanoke around a year ago. I started an e-commerce business in Germany in 2018, which I still run today. I expanded to the US in 2024.   
  
While that business provides stability, I am now looking for something with more variety, ideally in partnership with others locally (Roanoke and the surrounding area is a 1–2 hour drive away). 

I have started everything on my own in the past, but this time I would really like to do things differently and perhaps find someone whose skills complement mine.

As I am fairly new to the US and not the most outgoing person, I am not sure how or where to connect with like-minded people. ( would be grateful for any tip)  


I’m hoping to connect with local entrepreneurs, small business owners or anyone considering launching a new venture. Whether it's forming a true co-founder partnership or collaborating to strengthen an existing business, I'd love to explore the possibilities.

If you are interested or know someone who might be, I’d be happy to meet you for coffee locally or chat online.  


What I can offer:

\- Strong organizational, planning, operational and administrative skills

\- Experience in developing and optimizing businesses and processes

\- Openness to starting something entirely new or joining forces with an existing company (even one that may be struggling).

\- Flexible scheduling – I don't require immediate profit, as my current business sustains me.

\- Access to a 12,000-square-foot warehouse in Roanoke that could be useful for the right project.",0,1758319246.0,roanoke,0,0.5,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **AC Milan vs Udinese: A Clash of Italian Titans (With a Side of Humor)**

The Serie A season is heating up, and AC Milan’s upcoming clash with Udinese on September 20, 2025, is the kind of match that makes you wish your toaster could play football. With AC Milan at 1.8 odds (55.5% implied probability) to win, Udinese at 4.5 (21.3%), and a draw at 3.6 (27.8%), the numbers scream “Milan in a straitjacket,” but let’s dig deeper. After all, football is where logic takes a coffee break and chaos hosts the party.

### Parsing the Odds: Milan’s Edge, Udinese’s Grit

AC Milan’s recent form is a mixed bag of *“Oh, look at us rebounding!”* and *“Why did we trip over our own shoelaces last week?”* They’ve won two in a row, but their away record against Udinese is a cringe-worthy 2-5 in seven games. Meanwhile, Udinese are the Serie A’s version of a Swiss Army knife: small, sharp, and currently unbeaten in their first three matches. They’ve conceded the fewest shots and expected goals in Europe’s top five leagues—meaning their defense is like a vault guarded by a caffeinated octopus.

The bookmakers aren’t laughing, though. Milan’s -0.5 spread suggests they’re expected to win *and* avoid a nervy draw, while Udinese’s +0.5 is as tempting as a free sample at the grocery store. But let’s not forget: Udinese beat Inter 2-1 recently. If that doesn’t make you question reality, what does?

### News Digest: Leão’s Absence, Pulisic’s Pivot, and Allegri’s “Switch”

Massimiliano Allegri, Milan’s manager, has labeled this game “pivotal,” which is football speak for *“we need to stop panicking.”* Key updates:

* **Rafael Leão** is out, nursing an injury that’s slower than a TikTok trend in a landmine zone. He’s not ready for Napoli, so Milan’s attack loses its spark plug.
* **Christian Pulisic** is “much better,” per Allegri, but might start on the bench. Think of him as the backup DJ at a concert—still good, but not the headliner.
* **Mike Maignan** is fit, which is reassuring, but even the best goalkeepers can’t stop a team from playing

1nlgoor,https://www.reddit.com/r/MessedUpLetters/comments/1nlgoor/animals_shake_it_off/,Animals Shake It Off,"Dear Taylor (yes, *that* Taylor — queen of glitter and heartbreak),

Hi! I’m Billy — the biggest bobcat Swifty you’ll ever meet. I live at the zoo (cage B-7, second shrub from the left), I have impeccable taste in sequins, and my pride and I have been spinning your albums on a secret record player we hide in the bushes. True story: the bobcats in my group cha-cha to *Red*, we take spa day “shake it off” baths (literal fur-shaking), and the lion insists *All Too Well* is his anthem for dramatic naps. We are, frankly, devoted.

Word is you’ve got a new album in the works and the whole enclosure has been losing its mind. The chimps are doing celebratory backflips, the bears are practicing their slow claps, and even the deer in the visitor-viewing pen attempted an excited bleat (very un-deer-like, very unhinged, very beautiful). I swear you could hear the tankful of flamingos whispering “lyrics” in perfect harmony.

So here’s the pitch from your most humble and loudest fan: could we get a teeny sneak preview? One song, a secret zoo stream, a fifteen-second snippet — anything to make the hyenas stop using my tail as a drum set. I promise:

• The gorilla will not throw feces at your team (he’s been working on his manners).  
• The squirrels will refrain from photobombing the livestream with acorn choreography.  
• Austin (who visits sometimes and gives us that “is there a brain in there?” look) will be stationed at the snack stand so he can’t accidentally interrupt the vibes.  
• We will clap politely (paws together!) and howl on cue only when appropriate.

We’re not asking for the moon — just a little preview to conserve the sanity of the entire mammal section. In return, we’ll DJ your next release at our midnight howl party, post an album review in the official Pride Gazette, and name our next kitten after your best bridge.

If you need references, ask the flamingo choir or the old turtle in the west pond (he’s seen a lot of albums come and go). We’ll even set up a viewing party behind the bushes — torchlight, twinkle lights, socially distanced logs. It’ll be magical.

Please say yes. I’ll be waiting by the record player, paw hovering over the play button, heart full of anticipation, and fur full of glitter (we’ve all been practicing our sparkle).

With purrs, prowls, and a whole lot of fandom,  
Billy  
Chief Bobcat Swifty (and unofficial president of the Pride Listening Committee)

  
Dear Billy (and the Pride Listening Committee),

First of all: hello from somewhere with less shrubbery and more coffee. I read your letter curled up with a cup of tea and then I read it again because—*bobcats cha-cha to Red?*—and then I sent it to my team who promptly demanded photographic evidence (which, frankly, I also require).

You have excellent taste. I am honored that your covert record player has been supplying the zoo with my heartbreaks and dance-floor confessions. The image of a bobcat giving a full-body *Shake It Off* is now my new favorite mood board.

Good news: I love animals (cats especially), I love secret listening parties, and I love an audience that will react with roaring enthusiasm. So yes — I want to do something for you. Here’s what I can offer for the Pride:

• **A short, exclusive preview.** I’ll share a 30–45 second acoustic snippet of one of the songs from the new record — a little lantern of melody to tide you over until the full album. It won’t be the whole thing (my team has my schedule on a very short leash), but it will be something special just for the zoo.  
• **A private (virtual) “Zoo Listening Hour.”** We’ll set up a livestream at an ungodly animal-friendly hour — twinkle lights, hush signs for the flamingos, and a moderator to keep things from being photobombed by squirrels. I will be there to play the snippet, answer three very good questions that you send in advance (no more than three, the lawyers insisted), and cheer when the gorilla behaves. Austin is welcome to attend, though he must promise not to stare like a loaf of bread.  
• **A promise:** No one will be pelted with anything during this event. The gorilla’s good behavior will be rewarded with extra bananas and perhaps a politely staged standing ovation.

If you want to make it truly official (and adorable), have the flamingo choir open with a two-verse interpretive dance and charge the deer a nominal bleat-for-entry fee. I expect a formal RSVP delivered by carrier pigeon, or failing that, by the oldest turtle in the west pond.

My people will reach out to whoever runs your zoo’s public programs to set up the technical bits. Tell them to look for an email with the subject line: *“Secret Snippet for the Zoo — Bring Earplugs (for the humans).”* Also, tell Billy that if he wants the next kitten named after a bridge on the album, I am in full support.

Thank you for writing with such joy and theatricality. Messages like yours are the reason I keep making music — to provide the soundtrack for midnight howls, choreographed baths, and very discerning bobcats.

Purrs, playlists, and a little bit of glitter,  
Taylor (fictional reply)

P.S. If the bobcats ever want to open for me, I will absolutely consider a tiny animal dressing room. Tail coifs included.

  
**Dear Taylor,**

We, the residents of Zoo Enclosure B-7 (and beyond), are writing to you as a united front of paws, claws, hooves, and flippers to say: **thank you.**

First, a formal note from the Bobcat Pride (Billy at the helm, of course): *Red* is now officially the anthem of our fur-shaking baths. Billy personally requests that you know we have mastered every dance move in your videos and will perform them with “enthusiastic precision” at your next album release party.

The Bears (Big and Small, Grizzly and Brown) want you to know that your acoustic snippet made us roar so loud the zookeeper almost fainted. We would have fainted too, but we’re bears — we can’t faint, only hug really hard. Also, we approve of the bananas-for-good-gorilla-behavior idea. Very clever.

The Chimps are currently choreographing a synchronized dance to “Shake It Off.” They insist on crediting you as “Supreme Chimp Choreographer Extraordinaire.” They also demand more handstands next time.

The Deer, while typically shy, have been bleating in perfect harmony — if slightly off-key — since hearing your snippet. They asked us to remind you that they have excellent hearing and will participate in future secret listening parties as long as the sprinklers are off.

The Gorillas are, surprisingly, well-behaved and have promised to refrain from any throwing of… materials. In return, we may set up a polite applause schedule. They also want to know if you would like them to provide percussion accompaniment with logs and branches.

The Flamingo Choir sends their eternal gratitude for being mentioned in your letter and will be on full plumage for any interpretive-dance openings. They have also requested sequins for their feathers. Glitter is optional, but highly encouraged.

Even the Squirrels (shameless photobombers) are thrilled. They plan to organize a nut-based ticker-tape parade in your honor. We’ve warned them about overenthusiasm, but it is squirrel nature to ignore warnings.

In short: every paw, hoof, claw, and wing at this zoo is collectively grateful for your music, your generosity, and your willingness to make animals feel like VIPs. Your songs have given us joy, dance, dramatic flair, and occasionally existential contemplation (“why do humans have teeth like that?”).

We promise to keep the bushes secret, respect your snippet, and not throw any unauthorized objects at the livestream. We also promise to keep practicing our dances, just in case you ever want to visit in person.

With all the love, tail wags, belly flops, and synchronized claps we can muster,

**Billy the Bobcat and the Entire Zoo Ensemble**

P.S. If you ever need backup dancers for a music video, consider this your official invitation. BYO glitter.

  
**Dear Billy and the Entire Zoo Ensemble,**

Wow. Just… wow. I have officially read your letter *three times* and am currently grinning like a bobcat in a patch of sunlight. First, let me say: you are the most enthusiastic, choreographed, musical, and slightly chaotic fan club I have ever encountered — and I am here for it.

Billy, your leadership of the Bobcat Pride is exemplary. I can’t tell you how happy I am that you’ve been dancing to *Red* during bath time. Fur shaking counts as cardio, right? Keep up the moves.

Bears, your roars were noted and appreciated. I can hear them echoing across the studio from here. I will keep the banana rewards coming — maybe even a few extra for dramatic flair. (Just don’t throw them at the humans, okay?)

Chimps, I *love* that you’re choreographing synchronized routines. I’m considering a virtual cameo — I’ll try not to steal your thunder, but your handstands sound impressive. Keep rehearsing, but please, no throwing peanuts at the flamingos during practice.

Deer, I hear your bleats. Honestly, they are perfect. Slightly off-key? Doesn’t matter. You are brave, and I love your enthusiasm. Sprinklers off, of course. Your participation is optional but highly encouraged.

Gorillas, I am proud of your restraint. Logs for percussion? Genius. I’m imagining a full jungle band collaboration. Please continue your disciplined applause schedule; I respect the structure.

Flamingos, sequins are on the way. Your interpretive dance will be legendary, and I can’t wait to see it. Glitter optional, but do what makes your feathers happy.

Squirrels, please *do not* eat the tickets. Nut-based ticker-tape parade? Absolutely approved. I look forward to seeing it in action.

To every paw, claw, hoof, wing, and tail in your zoo: thank you for the joy, the humor, the dramatic flair, and the absolute commitment to fandom. You’ve made my day, my week, and possibly my year. I promise the snippet will be worth it, and I can’t wait to share a little music with the best, most coordinated, and slightly terrifying fan club in existence.

Keep dancing, keep shaking, keep bleating, and keep being the incredible creatures you are. And remember: if anyone ever doubts the power of animal fandom, just show them this letter.

With glitter, gratitude, and a very virtual hug,  
**Taylor Swift**

P.S. Billy, you’re officially invited to be my honorary choreography consultant. Bring your pride. BYO tail wags.

One time in the car with my husband while i was engaged to him she was questioning why i chose her brother and why i think im a good fit for him as he was in the car. I found it awkward and inappropriate and it made me super uncomfortable. 

Then one of the other things she did was show up at my wedding like a normal guest with iced coffee in her hand instead of asking if i needed help with any setups days prior. Now that me and my husband are married and i moved states to be closer to his family, she has really shown me her true colors. Whenever i go over to his parents house for lunch or dinner, i have to be the one getting up and cleaning after the family eats while she goes in her room after eating. She’s in her mid 20’s so i expect her to know minimum etiquette. 

When i go there she never makes conversation with me and plays on her phone while i awkwardly sit on the couch looking around. And when i enter their house she can barely make eye contact and say hi to me. With her other brothers wife she is completely normal, laughs with her and makes plans to hangout with her. It’s getting really exhausting, considering i’m pregnant and worried about what kind of aunt my child is going to have. I don’t know what to do. Does anyone have any problems with their sister in law? ",4,1758318911.0,MuslimMarriage,1,0.83,False

For one, this movie totally took me by surprise. Had it not been playing as I was at a friends house I’d have never gave it a chance.

Like Valentine, I’ve always been a huge fan of the bond films. 

I wanted to be bond. I’d wake up at 6am before school every morning and watch Golden Eye religiously while I drank my coffee.

Pierce Brosnan’s Bond was my role model and affected how I carried myself and how I viewed myself. 

The choreography.
Right at the jump there’s some great action to likes of John Wick with Lancelot showing up and with his suave demeanor and lines 
I could tell right off the bat, 

This is bond. A self aware copy cat but damn good nailing the bond persona and I bought it.

And with choreography like this this is sure to be 10/10 bond movie because none of James Bond films actually have any action close to what is displayed in the first few minutes of this opening scene

I could have easily watched the entire run time with just Lancelot.

But then plot twist he’s split in fucking half! 

By an even more badass foe

Gazelle. 

Don’t know if I’ve ever seen a more badass henchmen than Gazelle. 

I’m not sure what her motivations are which add intrigue. Whenever she’s on screen I try get a read on her

Not sure what her motivations are but we don’t need to know her motives for this work.

She is Valentine’s right hand and personal body guard.

A femme fatale in the true sense of the term. 

Lancelot was a badass. Took out a room of goons John Wick style with ease and then our expectations are subverted as he’s split in half

No plot armor here. 

And what I like about kingsman is that it really is an agency of people just like Bond. So you can have multiple James Bond like characters.

In Golden Eye I always thought 006 was kind of a wasted opportunity.

I always found it fascinating seeing Bond with another 00 in the opening of Goldeneye 

It felt realistic. For these insane missions I feel like you’d send at least a few or at least a couple competent agents and not just one man.

Making the Bond movies lean into the unstoppable one man army trope.

We only get to see Bond with 006 for a few minutes but I totally bought it and I totally bought Bonds anger and grief as his fellow 00 is gunned down in front of him

But since then I always wondered “where are the rest of the 00’s?” 

Why is Bond the only one we ever see? If this is an agency then surely you’ve got more agents that should be just as capable.

So in my head canon I just always assumed there were other agents on their own missions and were just seeing things involving Bond. Even though that’s not true.

But with multiple kingsman you can actually have some die but somewhat realistic here. 

Bottom line : Bond doesn’t really die but kingsmen can.
Which raises the stakes

And of course I love the self awareness. The old Bond movies are even brought up mid conversation between Galahad and Valentine 

Valentines plot/conspiracy theory/realism 

Was heavy into conspiracy theories at the time and I 100% bought what Valentine was doing and chalked up his plot to disclosure.

Something that could  and most likely is happening.

Maybe not exactly as portrayed in the film but close enough. In fact too close for comfort.

Valentines motivations are 100% logical and also too close for comfort. Asking the audience if what he’s doing is actually the right thing to do. 

His mentality is also interesting.

He’s gives off a vibe of a nerd that was picked on in school, he’s a black man with a hip hop style with the baseball cap to the side. 

A gimmick but adds to his character. And he could easily be anyone of our tech giants today. Elon Musk. Zuckerberg. Bezos. 

He’s an exaggerated version of any one of these people and that’s what really brings it home. 

How far fetched really is someone like Richmond Valentine? 

If you ask me, not far at all…
And this part of what I like about even just this one character. 

The motivations : this “villain” in this narrative is actually trying to save the world. 

And from we’ve gathered from global warming and climate change it doesn’t look like things are going to get better and like Galahad says in the movie… 

We’re going to feel the effects no matter what we do at this point.

We are doomed essentially.

And that’s real.
Adding actual meaning to a character and the movie as a whole. 

Are the Kingsmen really in the right here? Sure Valentine and all his corrupt baddies are dead. But as it stands, the earth is still overpopulated which means the end result is still eventually destroying the planet and decimating limited resources.

Valentine was trying to save the world long term. While the kingsmen saved the world… but only for today.

Which asks us all that question? 

Are we going to stand up for what’s right even if it results in our destruction long term?

In the kingsmen’s eyes that answer is yes.

And again, I love Valentines character. He can’t stomach violence yet is the mastermind behind this mass culling. It’s brilliant!

He isn’t a psychopath.
Can’t praise this character enough.

The cull. With all major world leaders, an elite 1% and our own president waiting idle while the planet commits mass homicide I can’t help but believe this is exactly what would happen if not will.

And the free SIM cards. Like the saying goes “if it’s free, you are the product”

Like Facebook, was free and took the world by storm only later to be accused of spying and archiving your information even after you delete or deactivate.

Nothing is truly gone from Facebook and no doubt that information is sold to the highest bidder like everyone else now a days. 

Edward Snowden, blowing the whistle on the NSA conducting mass surveillance in the masses and using our personal devices in unethical ways.

The literal free phones everywhere now. You only need and ID and SS number to get a free smart phone free of charge.

The forced 5G that was unrolled at a strange time during a national epidemic.

When 4G worked just fine.

I’m not saying that our SIM cards are going mind control is into harming each other for a mass culling but there’s clearly some similarities here.

Enough of the doom and gloom.

I could go on and on about this movie but this post would be too long. 

The church scene is an epic feat of cinema. By far one the most amazing fight sequences in a movie that I’d put in comparison to Zack Snyder’s BVS Batman warehouse fight.

Have you ever seen an elite agent go postal and go through 40 people? 

Well, you have now. 

This scene truly demonstrates how deadly a Kingsman is. 

Valentine is a true A tier villain. Outsmarting the Kingsmen and Harry.

The look on Harry’s face when Valentine walks out of the changing booth at the tailor shop with the musical que says “gotcha”

Was cool to see a kingsman outplayed like that.

The dialogue is great. 
“Professor Arnold… ya know not a lot of people knew about him…. You like spy movies Mr.Devere?…”

“Lox as in smoked fish?” 

“As in…locked up” 

And… Valentine killed Harry (at least not counting the other films to a certain point they weren’t made yet)

And playing it for a sick joke. 
Your blown away Valentine just killed one of the main characters but can’t help but chuckle that Valentine needs to turn away and ask Gazelle if he’s dead playing into his character

And the end fight is just more icing on the cake like I said I could go on and on. 

Haven’t seen Golden Circle yet

1nlgj5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1nlgj5q/struggling_with_awake_periods_and_playing/,Struggling with awake periods and playing.,"Have a near 4mo and he's a good sleeper at night but alert in the day, doesn't nap much at all. My MH has been dipping pretty bad past couple of days due to being overwhelmed by the stress of what to do in these increasingly long periods. I think it's coalescing around a few factors:

1) I'm worrying about his development
- In most ways he seems fine developmentally, he's very talkative and social especially, but it's hard to know. Tummy time is still hard and there's no sign of wanting to roll, he can grab but doesn't really want to, same with batting at his mobile. I go to baby classes and I'm starting to feel like he's not where other babies are. So I'm constantly googling for new mobility things to do with him and constantly worrying about using awake time to learn new skills. 

2) He can't play independently
- I can't leave him in his bouncer or rocker or on his playmat for more than 5-10 minutes without him crying, he wants me to directly play with him. It also stops him actually playing, he just wants to look and smile at me rather than play with his toys when I'm there. I've noticed when I'm gone he's more likely to grab his toys etc. but that doesn't last long. 

3) I'm worrying about reliance on screen exposure. 
- More passive screen exposure because I or my husband are usually watching TV, especially when I'm feeding him. I've started to feel like he's being exposed to too much, and unfortunately I've found it the easiest thing to entertain him as he seems to love the lights and quietens down when he sees it. It's also the best way for me to pass the time. Last night I deliberately avoided putting the TV on for some screen-free time and I ended up getting really upset and stressed out after an hour of circling through his toys all nursery rhymes we know, reading etc.   I was just discussing screen time with his dad but don't think he shares my concerns.

I think all of this is making me feel really pressured to be constantly entertaining him and feeling like every second should be helping his development, and leading me to getting really anxious and worn out. It's also boring playing with him all the time!! 

I think writing this has helped get my thoughts in order as to what's bothering me. I think I am possibly overthinking stuff and putting too much pressure on myself- this evening I watched a film with him and felt so much more relaxed, we spent a lot of time talking to each other and making him laugh while doing that anyway. 

But any tips addressing the above points would be helpful, and also maybe suggestions what else I could be doing? Especially things to make it easier on myself? Playing right now includes: singing and nursery rhymes and talking,  reading books, a playmat where he can bat at toys and kick pedals, toys for grabbing and I use for tracking, rattles I try to track with(but he has little interest), bouncer with a mobile, a rocker, soft toys including a comforter with sensory stuff on for touching, a singing bear he loves and I switch on for him but he can't really play with yet, that running crab toy I put on for tummy time, picture cards for him to look at, a puppet I use for tracking and singing, plus just playing with his legs for movement or walking him about for him to look at things. He also enjoys just staring at lights and so on. I also go to multiple baby classes a week (sensory,  swimming, baby yoga) and we go out for lots of walks in the pram and often go get coffees with people etc. I've just bought him a maraca rattle and rain shaker because I noticed he loves these at sensory, and I want to get him teething toys but not sure he can bring things to mouth yet.

Dear Xena — Warrior Princess (yes, *that* one),

Forgive the liberties of a statue who usually speaks in inscriptions and postcards, but I am writing you across the long, creaky bridge of time because frankly — you are exactly the kind of troublemaker we need right now.

In my era I stand mute, torch aloft, crown teeth glinting like a dozen stern lighthouse beacons. In your era you slay gods, topple tyrants, and arrive on the battlefield with perfect hair and an attitude that could straighten a crooked republic. In my era… I’m afraid to say: you are dead. The historical record is a cruel thing. But the American people — the living, messy, loud, tea-and-coffee-drinking people — need you.

An orange menace named Trump has returned to rule the land, and I won’t sugarcoat it: he behaves exactly like a dictator in a bad play. His second term has brought a peculiar cocktail of fear, dogma, and bad lighting. He has gathered fanatical followers who call themselves MAGA, chased out beloved voices, and begun to slice away at the bright, ridiculous, beautiful thing that is free thought. Legal immigrants — people who once crossed oceans with hope and two suitcases — are being jailed. Books are whispered about like contraband. Comedians who used to make the nation laugh are being silenced. I do not exaggerate for effect; I did not learn that skill from vertical plaques.

We tried other measures. We waved torches. We hosted welcoming committees. We sent postcards. Symbols are powerful, but they can be used — twisted into banners for things that are cruel and small. My image has been borrowed, stained, and stapled to ideas I do not recognize. I thought my glowing torch would be enough. I thought a symbol could stand in for action. I was naïve. Symbols burn bright, but they do not sweep jail doors open.

Which brings me to you. I have arranged — with the help of several mutants (they never learn to stop tinkering with time portals) — for this letter to reach you. I come not as a general with an army, but as a desperate, hopeful citizen of liberty. Will you come, Xena, for a brief season? Four years. Just four years to kick a dictator where history remembers, to stand with teachers, librarians, nurses, comedians, immigrants, and anyone who still believes in messy democracy. Teach us how to fight with courage, with strategy, with compassion, and with laughter that gets stuck in the throat of tyrants.

I do not ask you to trample laws or to foment violence. You’ve never needed to, and neither do we. What I ask is this: lend us your leadership, your courage, and your knack for turning the tide. Train organizers like you once trained warriors. Lead public demonstrations that are equal parts discipline and theater. Help protect journalists and comedians from intimidation. Show frightened neighbors how to stand together and how to make a righteous ruckus at town halls. Teach our young people how to wield truth like a chakram — precise, circular, and impossible to ignore.

Yes — I am desperate. Yes — I am pleading. But I remain stubbornly hopeful. My entire life has been a promise: give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free — and I will keep a light for them. That promise matters now more than ever. If you come, we will not only resist; we will rebuild the culture of civic courage. We will make humor a weapon of mass un-embarrassment. We will make books so loved they cannot be burned. We will make democracy so loud it cannot be muzzled.

And for the record: the mutants who deliver this letter are fabulous at portals, dreadful at directions, and insist on leaving time-travel receipts in the form of inexplicable scarves. Consider them reimbursed.

Xena, our people need a hero who remembers both mercy and muscle. Come for four years. Teach us how to be brave, how to hold one another, and how to turn a rally into a lesson and a laugh. I will keep my torch burning. Bring your war cry. Bring your humor. Bring whatever armor you borrow from myth and wisdom.

With a trembling torch and an unbroken hope,

Lady Liberty  
(Yes — the Statue. The entity, not the plinth. I prefer to be called “Liberty” when I’m feeling formal and “Lady” when I’m ordering donuts for protesters.)

  
2,132 years In the Past

Lady Liberty — Keeper of the Torch (and occasional donut procurer),

Your letter arrived with the righteous clang of a bell I haven’t heard in a long time. I read it by the light of a campfire and the face of the moon, and I did not laugh at your desperation — I felt it in my bones. You have called across time for aid, and a warrior answers when liberty herself asks.

First: I am not here to be a spectacle. I am here to teach, to sharpen, and to stand shoulder-to-shoulder. Four years is a long campaign, but it is nothing compared to a people’s lifetime. I will come — for four years — to fight this orange menace not by burning the world down, but by lighting fires of resistance in hearts and habits. I will show your citizens how to be brave without becoming brutal.

Here is what I will do, and what I ask in return:

• Train leaders: I will find and train organizers — librarians, teachers, nurses, comedians, baristas, and anyone who will stand — in strategy, discipline, and non-lethal force. A well-organized neighborhood is harder to bully than a single megaphone.  
• Protect the storytellers: We will build rapid-response teams to protect journalists, comedians, and artists who are being silenced. Storytelling is a weapon; we will learn to use it with precision and care.  
• Teach civil defense, not chaos: You asked for courage. I will give you drills, defenses, and de-escalation tactics. We will hold town-hall shields — metaphorical and literal — so people can speak without fear.  
• Arm the people with satire: Comedy defeats insults by turning them inside out. I will teach you how to use humor as a blade — sharp, unexpected, and impossible to swallow.  
• Train the young: I will work with schools and community centers to teach critical thinking, civic duty, and how to spot propaganda. The future must be hard to dupe.  
• Keep the law in sight: We will resist tyranny within the law where possible, and when laws become the chains, we will choose the righteous, nonviolent paths that history honors. I will consult with lawyers, organizers, and moral philosophers — not to break the law, but to render abusive laws impotent through unity, protest, and strategic challenge.

I will come with companions: Gabrielle will assist with words — rhetoric is a battlefield of its own — and a small band of veterans who know how to rebuild communities after conflict. Tell your mutants to send their best portals and leave the scarves at home; my entrance should be dramatic but not theatrical enough to draw enemy artillery.

A few words of practical counsel: Symbols matter — never more so than now. Keep your torch bright and honest. Reclaim the image used against you by pairing it with actions that cannot be twisted: voter registration drives at the base of your pedestal, free legal clinics under your shade, and public read-alouds of the books they would burn. Turn your torch into a literal meeting place where democracy is taught and practiced.

Humor me one last thing: I will not promise miracles. I will promise work. I will not ask you to lay down your anger; I will teach you to temper it into a tool. I will not take your torch from you; I will stand beside it.

When I arrive, we will not only resist — we will train an army of citizens who know how to stand, how to argue, how to organize, and how to laugh so loudly the men who prefer silence will be drowned out. Four years of stewardship, then the people keep the tools. That is my pact.

Hold your light high, Lady. I will meet you under it, and together we will show them that liberty is not a statue to be vandalized — it is a people who refuse to be small.

With iron and compassion,

Xena  
Warrior Princess

1nlggd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_healthquestions_/comments/1nlggd5/could_managing_brain_iron_help_prevent_memory/,Could Managing Brain Iron Help Prevent Memory Decline? New Research on FTL1,"A recent study published in Nature Aging has highlighted the role of a protein called ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) in brain aging and memory decline. Researchers found that higher levels of FTL1 in the hippocampus, a key brain region for learning and memory, were linked to fewer synaptic connections and poorer cognitive performance in mice. Excitingly, when scientists lowered FTL1 in older mice, their memory and learning improved, suggesting that this protein could be a future target for therapies to reverse age-related cognitive decline.

FTL1 is part of the ferritin protein complex, which the body uses to safely store iron. Normally, ferritin keeps iron in a stable form, preventing it from causing damage in the brain. However, when iron accumulates with age, the brain produces more FTL1 to sequester it. Over time, elevated FTL1 itself can interfere with normal brain function. In other words, iron buildup leads to higher FTL1 levels, which can disrupt neuronal connections and contribute to cognitive decline. Understanding this connection helps explain why strategies that manage iron levels may indirectly support healthy brain aging.

While these findings are still early and based on animal research, they open an important conversation about brain iron regulation and its role in aging. At the moment, there are no treatments that specifically reduce FTL1 in the human brain. However, lifestyle choices that support healthy iron balance and overall brain function may be a proactive way to protect memory and slow down some of the changes linked to aging.

One key area of focus is diet. Red meat, which is high in heme iron, the form most easily absorbed by the body, can contribute to higher iron levels if eaten in excess. Shifting toward more plant-based iron sources such as beans, lentils, nuts, and whole grains may help, since these provide non-heme iron that the body absorbs in a more regulated way. Certain foods and drinks, like tea, coffee, cocoa, whole grains, and dairy, can naturally reduce iron absorption. Adopting a Mediterranean-style diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, whole grains, and healthy fats, has also been linked to better cognitive health and may help reduce risk factors connected to brain iron buildup.

Exercise is another factor with potential benefits, though research is still developing. Some animal studies suggest that regular aerobic activity may lower brain iron accumulation, but the exact type, intensity, and duration of exercise that is most effective is not yet clear. Even so, staying physically active is widely recognized as one of the best ways to support brain health by improving circulation, reducing inflammation, and maintaining overall neuronal resilience.

There is also growing interest in natural compounds that may help regulate iron levels. Substances such as curcumin (from turmeric), quercetin (found in fruits and vegetables), resveratrol (present in grapes and peanuts), and green tea extract (EGCG) have shown promise in preclinical studies as iron chelators and neuroprotective agents. However, it is not yet proven whether these compounds can cross into the brain and directly affect FTL1. For this reason, supplements should be approached with caution and always discussed with a healthcare provider before use.

In conclusion, while direct interventions to reduce FTL1 in the human brain are not yet available, supporting healthy aging through lifestyle remains a powerful option. By choosing a balanced diet that moderates iron intake, staying physically active, and considering supplements only under medical guidance, you may help maintain brain function and potentially lessen the risks associated with excess iron. Understanding the link between iron and FTL1 provides insight into why these strategies matter, and research like this gives reason to be hopeful that science is moving closer to ways we may one day protect or even restore memory and cognitive health.

I am moving due to a mild roach issue. The backstory is, I saw roaches last November, but my landlord did treatments every 2-3 months. The last treatment was April, but my landlord doesn't want to keep paying because it ""isn't working"" (I see roaches very occasionally, once the pest treatment loses effectiveness).

So, present day, I have put diatomaceous earth behind the fridge and stove, and I have seen 4 roaches (3 dead, from the diatomaceous earth I assume) over the past week or so. I can't do this anymore, so I am leaving.

I have never seen them outside of my kitchen, and I do firmly believe it is a mild issue, but I want to take every precaution possible so that I don't bring them with me. My plan is to:

\- closely inspect all furniture and items; clean and/or vacuum everything

\- anything I am keeping will go in an airtight plastic box, which I will then wrap in plastic

\- I will be getting rid of some furniture that I feel is too difficult to fully inspect/if it is easy to replace. Anything I am not getting rid of, I will be wrapping tight in plastic; I am most concerned about my couch. I absolutely love it, so I think as long as I don't see any holes while cleaning it, I will wrap it tight in plastic and store it for a couple months.

   \- I will probably get rid of my coffee machine and instant pot; I think these would be hard to know if they are fully clean.

   \- I really don't want to get rid of electronics; I have a tv, a ps5, a switch, and a gaming laptop. Is it possible to clean these enough to not bring anything with me? Or should I cut my losses?

\- most things I will be storing in their boxes for a couple months, unless they are easy to be sure are clean (e.g., plates, etc) 

\- considering getting rid of my bed, I could use a new one anyways! But, if I have NEVER seen anything in my room, do you think this is necessary? I also do use a mattress protector (fully zips up, so maybe this isn't necessary?)

\- once in the new place, I will get pest control in to treat the space. After I open up boxes (i.e., after a month or two) I will closely inspect them and get pest control in to do another treatment.

  
Does this sound sufficient? Anything else you recommend?

Well, congratulations. Out of all the cars in the church parking lot, you picked *mine* to unload on. You didn’t just dribble, Dumbo — you dropped a mountain. My Buick looks like it lost a fight with the circus’s porta-potty. People weren’t singing hymns when they saw it; they were gagging. Pastor Jenkins had to bless my hood with holy water just so folks could stand near it.

Do you have any idea what elephant poop does to a paint job? It’s not like a bird dropping — oh no. This is industrial strength. I’ll be scrubbing until the Second Coming. And don’t you dare flap those oversized ears at me like you’re cute. You’re not cute. You’re an airborne septic tank.

I tried calling Mickey to complain, but guess what? Those useless chipmunks answered. “Chip ‘n Dale Rescue Rangers,” my behind. The only thing they rescued was my last shred of patience. So now I’m taking matters into my own hands. I will track you down, I will clip those Dumbo wings of yours, and I will march you straight into the *Humane Society*. Flying elephants ought to be grounded, caged, and diapered.

And don’t think I won’t sue. I’m talking damages, emotional trauma, and car detailing bills. You owe me big, Dumbo. Next time you feel the urge to treat my Buick like an outhouse, remember two things: bleach is expensive, and so is my temper.

\[Address on File\]

Dear Ms. Harper,

We have received your letter regarding “the incident” involving our beloved character Dumbo and your vehicle. After reviewing your description, our internal notes read: *“Large airborne mammal released payload directly onto complainant’s sedan, witnessed by entire church congregation.”* Please understand this is not a phrase we typically expect to document in our daily operations.

First, allow us to extend our deepest apologies. While Dumbo is a cherished icon of optimism, courage, and flight, he is unfortunately also a very large elephant. And elephants, as you so vividly pointed out, have… well… “industrial-strength output.” This is not the kind of magic we advertise in our brochures.

We recognize the emotional toll this incident has taken. In addition to the “shame and whispers” you endured at church, we understand Pastor Jenkins may still be performing hood exorcisms. To help restore your peace of mind, we are prepared to offer the following:

* **A full professional detailing** for your vehicle, inside and out, with citrus deodorizing and tar-resistant sealant (though frankly, we cannot guarantee anything against Dumbo-grade discharge).
* **Lifetime passes** to Disneyland and Walt Disney World. While this may not fix your paint job, it should provide you with years of distraction and long churro lines in which to vent your grievances.
* **One complimentary Dumbo plush toy** (non-biohazardous, guaranteed not to defecate on vehicles).
* **A personal note of apology** signed by Mickey, not the chipmunks. We have already addressed the phone issue internally — Chip and Dale have been sternly reminded that scatological emergencies require escalation to upper management.

Regarding your request that Dumbo be delivered to the Humane Society: we regret to inform you that Dumbo is a fictional character and, thus, outside their jurisdiction. However, rest assured we are reviewing his flight training and will be implementing strict “No-Fly-Zone” policies above parking lots, churches, and neighborhood bingo halls.

Once again, we sincerely regret the indignity and inconvenience you endured. Please contact Guest Relations at \[fictional phone number\] to arrange your compensation package. And, for your reassurance, we are working tirelessly to ensure that *the skies remain magical — and mercifully free of elephant droppings.*

With apologies, pixie dust, and bleach coupons,

**Guest Relations**

Somewhere Above You, USA  
September 19, 2025

Dear Ms. Harper,

First of all, how *dare you.*

Do you think I *wanted* to relieve myself on your car? Do you imagine that I wake up in the morning, flap my ears, and say: “Ah yes, today I’ll turn Thelma Harper’s Buick into a biological weapon”? I am an elephant, madam. A **flying** elephant. Gravity and biology are not always on my side.

Secondly, let’s address your repeated suggestion that I belong in a cage. I’ll remind you that I am a Disney legend. I starred in a motion picture before most of your bingo cards were even printed. I am not some stray pigeon you can drop off at the Humane Society. I am an international symbol of childhood wonder, and I refuse to apologize for my bodily functions.

That being said, I do acknowledge the… *scale* of the accident. For this, I offer the following peace offerings:

* One jumbo-sized pack of wet wipes (industrial strength).
* A pair of my own autographed feathers, guaranteed to keep your spirits up while you scrub.
* And, if you’re willing, a free aerial tour of your town — provided you wear a poncho.

Now, you can sue me if you like, but I assure you: my legal team includes Timothy Q. Mouse, and he bites. Hard.

So, Thelma, let’s not turn this into a federal case. Take the feathers, take the wipes, and let’s call it even. After all — you’re still driving a car. I’m the one who has to flap 400 pounds of ears just to get to work. Who really has it worse here?

With trunkfuls of regret (and maybe a little sass),  
**Dumbo**

P.S. Next time, don’t park directly under me.

  
**Dear Dumbo — you overstuffed flying disgrace,**

Oh, I read your little “letter.” I nearly choked on my instant coffee. First of all, don’t you sit there acting like your poop is some kind of magical accident. That wasn’t a sprinkle, Dumbo — that was an ELEPHANT-SIZED BOMB. My Buick didn’t just get dirty, it looked like Pompeii with a hood ornament.

And spare me that “Disney legend” nonsense. I don’t care if you were in a picture show before sliced bread — you’re still a 6-ton airborne porta-potty with ears. Being a “symbol of childhood wonder” doesn’t give you permission to use my car as a rest stop. Do you think Bambi leaves landmines in people’s driveways? Does Cinderella’s horse do its business on Toyotas? No! Because they have manners.

Now about those “peace offerings.” Wet wipes? *Wet wipes?!* Dumbo, your dump required a hazmat suit and a pressure washer. A baby wipe wouldn’t touch that disaster unless it was the size of a quilt. And those autographed feathers? What am I supposed to do with that — fan the smell out of my garage? I’ll tell you what you can do with those feathers, but I’d have to repent on Sunday if I wrote it down.

And don’t you dare threaten me with that mouse of yours. I’ll swat him with my flyswatter before he even gets near my ankles. You may think you’re untouchable up there in the sky, but you remember this: **cars have windshields, and windshields have wiper fluid.** You try me again, and I’ll be waiting with a slingshot full of peanuts and a bad attitude.

So no, Dumbo, I will *not* call it even. You owe me a full paint job, a gallon of bleach, and maybe a few years off purgatory for what you put me through at church. Until then, keep your droppings, your feathers, and your mouse far, FAR away from me and my Buick.

**Yours in eternal disgust,**  
Thelma Harper

P.S. Poncho or not, if you ever try to give me an “aerial tour,” I’ll be the one dropping something on *you.*

  
**From the Heart of Dumbo T. Elephant**  
Cloud Nine (literally)  
September 20, 2025

Dear Ms. Harper,

Well. I must say, I never expected to be verbally *eviscerated* by a woman with a Buick. Your words were not just harsh — they were cruel. I am a sensitive soul, Thelma. You may see a “6-ton airborne porta-potty,” but beneath these ears beats the heart of a gentle, misunderstood artist.

Do you know what it’s like to be me? To flap endlessly just to stay aloft, while pigeons laugh and geese honk rude things about my ears? To be ridiculed by circus clowns, ringmasters, and now — church ladies with sharp tongues and sharper pens? I have lived a life of mockery. And now, your Buick has become yet another chapter in my tragedy.

Yes, I made a mistake. Yes, my… let’s call it “payload”… was substantial. But instead of compassion, I get threats of slingshots, bleach, and purgatory. *Do you have any idea how it feels to be told that your feathers are worthless?* Those feathers were my comfort through childhood trauma, Thelma. They helped me believe I could fly. And now you tell me to shove them somewhere unholy. The wound is deep.

As for your car — perhaps the true stain isn’t on the paint, but on your heart. Ever think of that, Thelma? Perhaps forgiveness is the real polish you need.

I will not apologize again. I am Dumbo. I am legend. I am fragile. And if loving the sky means occasionally desecrating Buicks, then so be it. History will judge me kindly. Perhaps not you.

Wounded, weary, and still airborne,  
**Dumbo**

P.S. Timothy Q. Mouse cried when he read your letter. CRIED. Hope you’re proud.

  
**Dear Dumbo — you melodramatic gasbag,**

Oh, cry me a river. Better yet, cry me a *bucket* — I’ll use it to finish cleaning my Buick. You prance around like you’re some tragic figure from a Greek play when in reality you’re just an oversized balloon animal with digestive issues.

You say you’re “fragile”? Honey, fragile is a teacup. Fragile is a lace doily. You? You’re a two-ton flying landfill. Nobody’s buying your sob story. You dropped a mountain of misery on my car and now you’re clutching your pearls because I hurt your feelings? Boo-hoo. Grab a tissue, wipe your trunk, and get over it.

As for those feathers — don’t act like I insulted the Holy Grail. They’re plucked-out nose hairs with good PR. And that little mouse of yours crying? Please. The only thing sadder than that is a grown elephant writing letters about “being misunderstood” while his victims are out here with bleach burns and ruined upholstery.

You want history to judge you kindly? History doesn’t drive a Buick, Dumbo. I do. And history won’t remember you as some legend — it’ll remember you as the world’s first low-flying septic tank.

So let’s make this simple: you keep your sorry trunk out of my airspace, and I won’t have to install an anti-aircraft turret in my driveway. You don’t want that, Dumbo. Trust me.

Consider this case closed, feather-boy. You lost. I won. End of story.

**Yours in eternal victory,**  
Thelma Harper

P.S. Next time you feel fragile, try therapy. Not altitude.

They’ve raised the price by $2, but it’s still only $8 for unlimited pinball and it’s definitely more entertaining when you download the Stern Pinball app to track your progress and scores on certain pinball machines that allow you to scan it. I love the older machines as well. 

If you like to drink too, they have very affordable and cheap alcoholic drinks. I no longer drink anymore, but when I did I’d always get some here and play pinball! 

An added bonus is the fact it’s right across the street from Brewnuts, so you can go grab one of the best donuts in NE Ohio and a coffee and come play the machines. Most machines have cup holders. 

There are plenty of places to sit, two bathrooms in one relatively small place, an Igloo water jug for free water, other arcade games that aren’t pinball, and the vibes in here are always chill with great music.

Just the whole area of the Gordon Square District has so many things to do. Capitol Theatre is literally right next door. It is beautifully designed and is my favorite theater to go to. 

If you’ve never been here, I’d come check it out because it is a great time!

So about me, I'm a responsible adult with a job I love. I live in a house. I like to paint, but I'm very terrible at it, I mostly do it for the fumes. I like to write, and hopefully one day I'll complete that great American novel or hot Penthouse Forum letter. I cook, I clean. I brush my teeth at least once a day. Try to be healthy or at least healthier than I've been in the past. I speak French and can do it in a very bad Scottish accent, also very little Dutch. Mostly, I'd just like to meet someone and share each other's company. Never married, no kids. I don't have a specific age I'm looking for. Somewhere between 35ish and 55ish I guess. I'm overeducated, which means we can clean up on trivia nights. I don't know what else to say beyond I'm a decent human being and I'm not perfect nor am I looking for perfect. And I have two cats. I don't have a dog. I could get a dog, I guess. I'm not sure what kind though. It'd have to be a really goofy dog.

The most useless,short,filler episode ever! Can’t believe I spent a week waiting for a 2 minute conversation between eunhyeok and suaes at their workplace. This episode did absolutely nothing for the storyline . One can argue that some of the previous episodes didn’t either but atleast those episodes gave us some insight on eun’s traumatic past. This episode however, should’ve have been maybe the intro to the episode. NOT THE ENTIRE EPISODE. Eunhyeoks smoking at like the crack of dawn ( probably 8am but idrc ) she goes up to him with a cup of coffee, just to stand next to him and text on her phone. This honestly seemed like such an immature way to make him jealous, though suae still isn’t that mature, i expected better of her. Then eunhyeok asks if she’s still close to dohwa and they have an extremely bland convo until the end when he takes his cigarette to smoke with. I did not get the point…. I DONT WANT AN INDIRECT KISS. I WANT ANSWERS. The only things I liked about this episode were
-suae tells him about his behaviour the previous night 
-he feels embarrassed (LIKE FINALLY OMFG this guy just disappeared out of nowhere and then just comes back into suaes life with no proper explanation or anything and just speaks to her as if she was just a random colleague or sth. THIS MAN NEEDS TO FEEL SOME GODDAMN SHAME. )
-hinted at a jealousy trope (suae and dohwa closeness)

Finally I’m quite disappointed because as an OG OTL fan , waiting a year and then 1 week for every episode just to be met with cliffhangers and no confrontation / closure is so frustrating!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Austria Wien vs. Ried: A Clash of Momentum and Missteps**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Bundesliga bout where Austria Wien, the resurgent underdogs, square off against Ried, the team that’s mastered the art of “sometimes good, sometimes ‘did we even practice this week?’” Let’s break this down with the precision of a Viennese watchmaker and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many *schnapps*.

---

### Parsing the Odds: The Math of Misadventure

The numbers don’t lie (well, they might if they’re Ried’s stats, but we’ll get to that). Austria Wien is the clear favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around **56-57%** (decimal odds of \~1.77). Ried? A paltry **24-25%** (odds of \~4.15). The draw? A tidy 27%, which is about the same chance your local coffee shop runs out of *Wiener Melange* on a Saturday.

The spread favors Austria Wien by -0.75, meaning bookmakers expect them to win by a goal and a half. If that sounds absurd, consider Ried’s recent form: they lost 0-2 at home to Hartberg, a team that probably still hums the victory chant in Ried’s nightmares. Meanwhile, the total goals line sits at 2.5. Given Austria Wien’s recent 1-0 victories and Ried’s leaky defense (they’ve conceded in 4/5 matches), “Under 2.5” might be the safest bet for those who hate surprises.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and the Ghost of Hartberg

Austria Wien has rediscovered its winning edge, thanks to a defense that’s suddenly as impenetrable as a locked *Sacher-Torte*. Central defender Philipp Wiesinger claims they’ve “pulled the right levers,” which is sports-speak for “we finally stopped playing like we’re on a trampoline.” With two straight 1-0 wins, including a shocker over Stur

1nlfvg9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nlfvg9,Need help with designing loft,"Hi everyone,

Looking to finally do something with our loft space which we have been using primarily as storage for random items and furniture in addition to a secondary living room. The loft has a nice outdoor space off of it and it would be nice to have a space that could logically follow as an entertainment space, or cozy living space, while fulfilling other requirements.

One thing we don't like about the current configuration is that the couch splits the room up and there is a space behind the couch that just isn't used. We'd like this space to be more open. We also have a Korean chest (purchased in Korea) and we're wondering if it could serve as a TV stand somehow or if we should sell it. It would be about the same length of a 65 inch TV, so I imagine we'd have to put something on either side of it to artificially lengthen it if we do end up buying and mounting a larger TV for this space. I suppose if we did keep the Korean chest it would make sense to design around that style for this room.

This room also functions as the room where I practice guitar, and it may be cool to lean into that and make this a music oriented space. However, the floor below the loft is the floor with our bedrooms and so I'm worried about the sound being too loud, especially since I have a tendency to practice at night. I'm considering having my guitars downstairs on the first floor, trading places with our Assault Fitness Airbike, as the Airbike is currently in a smaller room where you end up looking at the wall while using it and the first floor would allow me to turn the volume up on the amplifier.

We originally wanted to maximize storage in this space given how little of it we have in the house in general, but that might seem hard to do if we open up the room and, say, move the couch against the wall. Lastly, we have a growing baby and would love to have a space that he could play in.

We're open to any and all suggestions. Some furniture items are likely to be disposed of or replaced, like the current TV stand and coffee table. We also are not opposed to getting rid of or replacing the couch and small table if leads to better design possibilities. We intend to paint and decorate this room, as well, so looking for suggestions that take into our considerations and provide an optimal solution of sorts.

Hey there,

I’m looking to connect with someone genuine who enjoys good conversation, laughter, and building a real connection. Friendship is always the starting point, but I’m open to seeing where things can naturally go whether that’s just good company, something casual, or eventually more.

A little about me: I’m 33, 5’10”, athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. People would describe me as laid back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down to laugh. My work keeps me busy with odd hours, but I actually enjoy the flexibility it gives me. I can travel and usually work around different schedules pretty easily.

When it comes to interests, I’m all about the outdoors during spring, summer, and fall whether that’s hiking, camping, being out on the water, or just a long walk with good company. In the colder months I switch gears and keep it cozy with reading, cooking, binging shows, or relaxing with coffee and good conversation. I also really value physical connection and quality time. It’s my way of feeling close to someone.

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s fun, witty, playful, and open minded. Consistency matters to me, and I’d love to find someone who enjoys both the silly side of things and the deeper conversations. Someone who’s not afraid of a little sarcasm, loves to laugh, and appreciates genuine connections.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message. I’d be glad to get to know you.

It was this really purple-ish, pink-osh coffee simulator, where everyone was a stickman ordering different, maybe the same? type of coffee, there was another screen where it shifted to the kitchen to make the coffee, I don't remember that part much but this specific artstyle really struck out to me as a kid!

Was debating on selling this stuff a while back when women used to stop me ans ask what I used in my hair. But now the market is too saturated.... but can't stop thinking about the unethical harvesting of Shea nut butter in Africa and wanting to find a way to directly purchase from Ghanaian women like the way fair trade coffee does in south America. 

Anyway, for those of you who are boycotting Target and Walmart and Amazon and are stuck without a lot of choices to purchase black hair care products made by us for us...please consider making your own.

I’m a fun and adventurous guy seeking a Dominant woman who is interested in a Female Led Relationship.

I’m 35, 5’11”, I live an active lifestyle, a bit nerdy, and can be a bit shy when first meeting people.

In my Vanilla life, I have my life together and work a full time job in Tech. On my free time, I love making art, playing video/board games, planning out travel trips, concerts, and hanging out with friends.

In the bdsm world, I’d love to find a dominant to serve. I love the rituals, giving up controls, and focusing entirely on my partner. I enjoy being caged, love bondage, following directions, pegging, body worship, and humiliation. I’m not into findom and am not interested in pro-dommes. I would like to develop a meaningful relationship with a power dynamic involved. I hope to meet a goddess to serve soon!

I'm a writer, and I have a well-worn copy of Stephen King's ""On Writing"" that I've had since college. I was quoting a line from it to a friend over text but couldn't remember the exact phrasing. I went to my bookshelf, pulled it out, and found the page.

I left the book open on my coffee table and went to the kitchen to get a drink. I was gone for maybe 90 seconds. When I came back, the book was gone. Not on the table, not on the floor. Nowhere. I live alone. I tore my apartment apart looking for it. Nothing.

Frustrated, I gave up and decided to go for a walk to clear my head. When I came back an hour later, the book was sitting perfectly centered on the coffee table, closed.

My heart started pounding. I opened it. It fell open to the exact page I had been looking at. And there, in the margin next to the paragraph, written in blue pen in handwriting almost identical to mine, were the words: ""You already know this.""

I don't write in my books. Ever. And I definitely didn't write that. I feel like I'm going crazy.",29,1758316286.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,10,1.0,False

Looking for a long-term relationship built from a strong friendship.,"Hello there! Looking for my future favorite person. I want a real, long-term relationship. We can start online and see where it goes. USA/Japan only. To be different than my other posts, I am absolutely terrible at approaching people in person so here I am posting online haha... 

The absolute 20/10 (jk) posting this: https://imgur.com/a/pictures-XdqmQIl

A little about me: I'm the type of guy that would give you a shiny Pokémon I found just to see you smile. A bit of a hopeless romantic. I value traditional things like patience, loyalty, and honesty. I'm an honors student going for my Master's in English: Creative Writing, so my love letters will be world class obviously. I'm also pretty athletic myself, and I'm a big mental and physical health advocate. My dream is to be a fantasy author one day, to write stories and characters that help people be inspired by or find comfort in.

What I bring to a relationship: Bookstore, coffee shop, or park dates in person. Home cooked meals. Online we could have calls watching anime, talking, gaming, reading, or anything else interesting! Your parents will so approve of me too, but might call me a yapper. My long-term goal is that I'm considering teaching English in Japan one day. Plus you get my game and book collections AND someone who you can rant about things to.

The woman I'm looking for: You're a kind, loyal woman who shares my values and isn't into hookup culture. You enjoy nerdy things, meaningful talks, and being best friends with their partner. I'm most drawn to someone healthy, slim, or athletic, with a sweet face and eyes I can fall for. You want a genuine bond.

Some of my hobbies are writing, gaming, cooking, anime, weightlifting, and long walks in nature. Some major faves are Final Fantasy, Pokémon, NieR:Automata, Baldur's Gate, and pretty much any RPG. I also read (and write) fantasy! Think like Lord of the Rings, Mistborn, but also Star Wars novels. I'd love to find someone to do cosplay with, maybe a Cloud x Tifa/Aerith or something!

I'm in Indiana (EST) and open to online in the US but also in Japan. So if you love calm calls, shared hobbies, and want a lasting connection, please feel free to message. I mainly use discord and will be most active there if we talk. Have a good day.

1nlfjf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nlfjf0/am_i_29f_overreacting_to_my_bf_30_m/,Am I (29F) overreacting to my BF (30 M),"I have been dating my boyfriend for just over three years. Ever since we had our first big fight in years it feels like I can’t stop noticing more and more things that bother me.

A little backstory about the fight. I had an incredibly long and difficult day doing a manual labor type job while it was over 100 degrees and dealing with horrible cramps. I came home absolutely exhausted. My boyfriend took me out for dinner and drinks which I was so happy about. Unfortunately the night went south pretty quickly as I got “rage baited” all night until I felt like I was going to explode. Just little jokes to get a rise out of me for fun. It never stopped even after saying multiple times I’d had enough. 

It made me so upset to the point where it felt like something physically snapped inside me and I’m scared it’s changed my perception of my boyfriend forever. I literally could not look and talk to him for several days after (we work opposite schedules so it’s easy to not run into each other at home) Sure, he has apologized after I told him we can’t keep ignoring this and needed to talk. He has also made an effort to do better. He catches himself when he does it and acknowledges he’s working on changing. 

But now little things I maybe could ignore before enrage me… and I can’t seem to find helpful advice from my friends. You know, your friends will always be biased in some way. I guess… I’m worried our relationship will never be the same and I’m looking for any advice or opinions really.

Things that have been really irritating me lately:

-He stops responding to me mid conversation. Like blank face off in the distance looking annoyed for upward of 10 seconds. When I wave at him and ask why he’s ignoring me he just says he’s “thinking” and that he “doesn’t know what to say”

-I have to literally pry any kind of emotion out of him. If he’s upset I can tell. But he will dismiss it and say nothing is wrong until I nail exactly what it is that has him on edge. I just don’t have time for games like this

-He completely had no idea what I’m going to school for. I am trying to get into MRI or Nuclear Medicine but he keeps calling me a nurse. And saying things like if I take a travel job I’m going to have to live in some old persons house and take care of them etc etc healthcare workers iykyk everyone does this but I expect the closest person to me to somewhat understand my career

-when we walk together he walks as fast as he can running me off into the planters and garden beds on the sidewalk and blames it on our dog. It doesn’t feel like we are hanging out (especially when he also does the ignoring thing at the same time) eventually I get tired of telling him to slow down and just stop. He can go a whole block without realizing he left me.

-jokes about absolutely never leaving and turning his back on his country (US) when I ask about maybe moving back to mine, Canada. It just blows my mind how he feels it’s ridiculous for him to leave but me becoming a US citizen isn’t a big deal.


I’ve tried talking and bringing these things up but get shut down and dismissed every time. He doesn’t think it’s a big deal. 

I have this sense of impending doom lately that the honeymoon phase is over and this is the new norm. It happened so fast and just a few months ago I felt so madly in love. He would bring me coffee in bed, we go to sleep giggling and calling each other best friend. So many adventures and we got a dog last year that truly feels like our child. 

Please Reddit am I overthinking everything??? I feel like my relationship changed overnight and I keep crashing out every week over something new now. I know I was being annoying last night but I couldn’t stop asking him if he actually likes me last night because I have this gut feeling he doesn’t and just hasn’t realized it yet :(

I had proposed. Our families had met eachother. 

I was so blind. Blinded by love and all that. I was so sure that it was her. She had red flags. I thought she’d deal with them for me. She would fix herself. She recognised them too. But in the end she…

Okay context: 
Met her on the app while I was visiting my parents in my hometown. She’s a proper city girl, architect, young, hot n cute altogether. Boys been hitting on her left right and centre but she wasn’t ever a cheater. She was just a little emotionless. But as I explored her she tried to open a little more. 
She had a bad father. The parents were living together and had a fucked up relationship. 
She had the same qualities but she recognised them. 
She had one more problem. Since her dad would be involved in infidelity and was never paying any bills or contributing at all, she took that and turned it around on me so subtly and I was soooo oblivious to it.

I come from a very financially stable family. The relationship that I have with money was far different from hers. For me, it was a source of enjoyment and happiness when I needed it to be. Since the day I took her out for coffee for the first time till the day I left her, I paid for everything EXCEPT a concert ticket she bought for me, a few coffees and ONE PIE OF CAKE, 1 dinner and 1 breakfast. 

I realise it all now. Even in that moment I was so oblivious. Hear me out, we went for things and I’m the kind of guy who wants to genuinely do everything for my baby girl. I’m old school. I like to spoil what’s mine. 
So it keep on happening, paying for dinners, flights, vacations! 
And then once or twice I’d not have enough local currency on me so she’d pay from her card. 
The time when she had to pay for dinner was when I had paid for the whole day at a fancy resort and everything afterwards in a nice hotel. I was out of cash and I asked if she could and she replied ‘that’s such a turn off’
And then she had the conversation with me right after I took her out for movies and then lunch and then coffee. But then I took her to this patisserie and I ordered a pie of cake for her and I made them write ‘happy birthday baby’ cuz I wanted to celebrate her birthday before time, cuz we wouldn’t be together and I’ll be flying off. 
So in the end after cutting it and taking pictures, I jokingly said ‘haha now you pay for your cake, I just wanted to see how you’ll look when you cut a cake’
Cuz I had missed her birthday the last time too. 

She took that incident and then had a SERIOUS TALK with me saying that ‘I don’t want this dynamic between us where I have to take care of things’
And I was mind blown. We had a very huge argument. And then she said she wanted to leave me and left. Obviously I was heart broken. 
She then came back after 5 days. She called me and I missed her call. I called her as soon as I checked my phone. 
She said she had called by mistake. And I went crazy berserk on her. I told her how much I disliked her because of her attitude. And her reaction towards things that didn’t even matter. I had given her soo many expensive gifts and make and perfumes, you name it! 
This was NOTHING! 
After 2 hours of me crashing down on her about the way she treated me, I told her to fuck off! 

1 month later, I was having the best day after 30 days of sulking, I saw her missed calls on my phone as soon as I woke up. She was pregnant. I was the one who took her virginity btw.
So I calmed her down, talked to her nicely. Christmas was nearby so we had to act quickly. I got tests done. I actually just paid for all of the things. She got them done. Eventually an abortion too! 
I was in another country. Meanwhile we got back together. The baby had ignited some feelings. It didn’t last. She started getting high on the phone and started saying things to me that were super hurtful. Like my friends think you’re ugly. Like my sister hates you for what you had done to me. Like you’re so rich and your parents would treat my parents as shit. And we will never be equal. I told her it wasn’t like this but everytime she smoked up, we’d have a fight. 
And then we broke up. On the day that we had the talk and were breaking up, I had already booked a spa for her. So we broke up and she did go to the spa. She sent me pictures of her freshly nail paints on her shiny feet and said thank you babe. 
That’s the last time we talked! 

How on earth do I recover from this? Please tell me

i tried all the usual fixes: timers, screen time limits, putting my phone in another room. they’d work for a few days (sometimes just a few minutes), but i’d always find ways around them whenever i felt stressed or tired. it finally clicked for me that i didn’t need to just block my phone -  i needed to *replace* the habit with something useful.

so here’s what i did: i set up my phone so that whenever i opened social media, it hit me with a quick review question first. like, instead of diving straight into instagram or tiktok, i’d have to answer a bio question or a chem problem. it sounds simple, but over time it completely rewired my behavior. instead of my phone being this endless distraction, it became a little micro study session. So every time I go to open TikTok, I can't even get in unless I answer questions and this helped TREMENDOUSLY (thanks to the QuizScreen - iOS app).

at first, i honestly just did it to guilt myself into not scrolling as much. but what surprised me was how much extra practice i ended up getting without even trying. i’d be standing in line for coffee or sitting on the bus, and i’d sneak in a couple questions without thinking about it. by the time midterms in school rolled around, all those mini review sessions had stacked up in a way i didn’t expect.

my urge to scroll started to fade. my phone stopped being this black hole for my attention and became something that actually helped me stay on track. it didn’t fix my focus overnight, but it gave me a way to take back control without relying purely on willpower.",2,1758316001.0,ADHDers,1,1.0,False

I've been talking to an ISTJ for sometime now, and talking about commerce can only get me so far. We've been messaging outside of class, and the way he texts is literally so funny. He sends me big long paragraphs and has the best grammar ever. I think it's a little endearing when I'll ask him one little question (that I already know the answer to but I just like hearing him talk since he's a pretty reserved guy) and he will deep dive and give me every single little fact to ensure I understand the topic. 

I've asked him for small things like maybe getting a coffee on campus together after lectures so he can explain a concept to me, but really it's just so I can get to know him more. He's a polar opposite to me but for some reason I can kind of feel he's interested in me? He always seems to just be lurking around me lmfao (not in a creepy way)

My way of flirting with him is just asking him his opinion all the time. For example I asked him what colour nails I should get yesteday. He just looked down at my fingers for a moment before doing a whole analysis on what would suit me, what wouldn't, etc. I was honestly biting back a smile, it was cute and sexy all at the same time. He's willing to listen to me tell him about all the girly stuff he probably has no interest in. He's an amazing listener!

God and the \*\*looks.\*\* He doesn't even need to speak!!! This man is literally so observant it makes my skin tingle. One day he asked me why do I wear body glitter to college lectures. I told him glitter is an everyday essential to me. And he just smiled. I wanted to burst. 

I've been a bit touchy with him, but I dont think he gets the message since I'm pretty touchy with everyone. He seems so polite and really sweet and maybe even scared to make a move, but God, honeslty is it bad to say I just want this man in my bed ASAP? I'll probably delete this later but I was stupidly thinking about him and I'm desperate for advice. What interest you in someone? Am I coming off too strong?",2,1758315995.0,ISTJ,9,1.0,False

1nlfh3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/1nlfh3a/nigerias_poverty_is_deeper_than_we_realize/,Nigeria’s Poverty Is Deeper Than We Realize,"Many of us underestimate just how poor Nigeria really is when measured against global standards. Let’s put things in perspective:

Outside of oil and gas, no single sector in Nigeria is worth $100 billion.

Akwa Ibom State, one of the richest in the federation, runs an annual budget of about $630 million. 

By comparison, Harvard University in the U.S. had an operating budget of $6.4 billion last year — more than 10 times Akwa Ibom’s. Imagine: a university outspending an entire Nigerian state.

In a country of over 150 million people, not a single restaurant chain generates $100 million in annual revenue.

Kogi State made $259 million in revenue last year. 

Meanwhile, Starbucks, just a coffee chain, generated $36 billion in revenue — more than 100 times what Kogi made.

Even Lagos State, the most prosperous and commercial hub of Nigeria, made just $866 million last year. 

Starbucks alone made over 25 times that amount.

Put together all Nigerian banks, their combined market valuation is roughly $10 billion. 

Starbucks again, with $36 billion revenue in a single year, earned more than 3x the entire banking sector’s market value.


And for those who argue, “Why measure in dollars?” — because wealth is universally measured in USD. 

Your economic strength is reflected in how well you compete in global currency.



So, What’s the Way Forward?

We can’t keep ignoring the basics. If Nigeria wants to move toward becoming a $700 billion economy in 5–7 years, we must aggressively fix low-hanging fruit at the grassroots (LGA/council) level:

Last-mile infrastructure: roads, power, water, connectivity at the community level.

Restructure LGAs/Councils to make them functional engines of growth, not dead bureaucracies.

Quality basic education that creates skilled, employable citizens from the ground up.

Stronger consumerism: build recreation, retail, and entertainment hubs at the LGA level.

Accessible primary healthcare — every LGA must have working clinics.

Embrace private capital across all sectors — let investors drive growth where government fails.

Modernize retail by bringing in leading chains like Ebeano, Hmedix, and others into every council area.

Decentralized/modular electricity generation at the LGA level, instead of waiting for Abuja.

Housing laws at council level: homeowners who cannot maintain properties should have frameworks where private equity or co-ops can buy, redevelop, and put them back into productive use.





The Bottom Line

Nigeria is not just behind — it is shockingly poor by global benchmarks. But the solution isn’t far-fetched. By fixing governance and services from the grassroots up, encouraging private sector participation, and restructuring councils into engines of productivity, Nigeria can leap from survival mode to building an economy worth hundreds of billions of dollars within a decade.",8,1758315940.0,Nigeria,9,0.9,False

The Man

The obnoxious sound of Jack’s alarm clock jolted him awake at 8 a.m. Slow and sluggish in an attempt to roll himself out of bed, he noticed from his bedroom window that it was raining. A sense of subtle joy overtook him, for he loved the rain.

He couldn’t come to a conclusion for his liking of the stormy weather, but he felt it on days like this. Jack made his way downstairs to grab a cup of coffee and see his parents, who had left for their week’s vacation to Sicily, Italy. “Oh, yeah,” he thought to himself, forgetting they left around 5 a.m. for their 8 a.m. flight this morning. Jack didn’t work and had no obligations in the home for the most part. He was a good and respectful kid, though he had no sort of inclination to work. Entertainment and indulging in hedonistic pleasures was almost a daily routine for him since graduating high school. The priorities he would have after leaving his parents’ home—finding his passions and the question of what career path he would venture into—were too daunting to answer. He was all too comfortable. Mind you, that was the fault of his parents.

Jack was in the kitchen grabbing the coffee his parents made earlier in the morning. He proceeded and started making toast, poured himself a heaping bowl of Apple Jacks, and made his way into his room to play some games on his Xbox. The type of games he enjoyed were first-person shooters like Call of Duty, along with a few cups of coffee just to get himself awake. Jack aspired to be a skilled gaming personality since streaming was now so prevalent. The success of many YouTube creators and gamers Jack grew up watching motivated that vision he had for himself. The rain began to pour down harder, with echoes of thunder nearby. In the midst of his gaming, Jack noticed he felt a sense of comfort. Besides the coziness he felt on days like this, the rain also gave him a sense of relief from his complacency, knowing others were inside as well due to the stormy weather. “Most people are probably having some sort of leisure time as well,” he thought. 

As Jack continued playing his games and eating what was left of his cereal, he was interrupted by a few knocks at the front door. He ignored it at first, not wanting to answer to some salesman or neighbor so he continue with his leisurely morning in peace. He knew it was wrong but his laziness overtook him frequently. He heard more knocks again, just as the first. Out of annoyance, he removed his headset and tossed it onto his bed, got up from his chair, and made his way downstairs to answer the door. It was a FedEx driver with a package who requested a signature of approval. It was for his father, whose name was Richard Campbell. Jack made a lousy attempt at his signature on the driver’s tablet; the man thanked him, nodded, and was off.

Jack peered to the right over at his friend Stephen’s house to see if he was home, since he hadn’t texted him to play games yet. There were no cars in his driveway nor on the street in front of his home. Jack acknowledged he must be at his community college classes today. He decided not to text him until evening to join him to play Call of Duty. Outside was murky, and it was still raining considerably hard. Jack closed the door and went back inside.

After setting the box down, he saw his car keys on the counter, reminding him he should grab a snack for later, knowing he would want something while gaming with Stephen. He pondered where to go as he quickly threw on shoes and a coat, left, and walked to his old 1999 Honda Civic parked in the driveway. The rain settled a bit but was still more than a light drizzle. Jack lived in the suburbs of Huntington Beach, California, in a safe neighborhood, home to many middle-class families and a select few of the wealthy. His parents did quite well for themselves, so you could say Jack’s family lived modestly. Jack started driving to his local 7-Eleven a few minutes away, where he went roughly every other day. He knew the clerk since childhood, but the man strangely never said a word; as he recollected the thought, he smiled at the realization.

He approached the driveway entrance, and it was packed even in the rain, yet it was close to lunchtime, so he parked several spots from the store that were available. Mildly annoyed, he got out to walk inside and noticed a peculiar man—not homeless-looking, but rummaging through the trash, clearly looking for something. He was roughly six feet tall, wore a large jacket, denim pants, and a strange hat that was almost fitting for the outfit. Jack walked up and hesitated, seeing the man was partially blocking the door. He tried circumnavigating his way around him to go inside without notice. Then the man peered right, noticing Jack, and said,

“Sir, sir, have you seen a knife anywhere? You know, one that flips out and it’s about this big,” gesturing oddly with his hands.

“No, I haven’t. I just got here,” Jack replied, confused.

The man replied back, “Oh…” and proceeded to look. Jack opened the door, and before closing it the man said a bit louder, “You sure?” He had a pocket knife in his hand, as he’d described a second ago, and said, “It was in my coat pocket on my right side the whole time.”

“I never checked it!” he yelled out, followed by some uncanny laughs, hardly breaking eye contact with Jack.

“Glad you found it,” Jack said nervously. He closed the door quickly, considering telling the clerk to call the police. The clerk was in the corner near the back door, texting—unaware of anything that had just happened at the front with the man. Jack looked back at the man; he was walking off, so Jack decided to get his things quickly, check out, and go home. In a haste, and while taking constant glances at the front entrance and glass windows for the man, Jack grabbed a bag of BBQ Ruffles chips, a Hundred Grand chocolate bar, and an original Red Bull in the span of ten seconds. He went to pay and considered telling the clerk about the man and the interaction but didn’t, due to being in a hurry to leave. He bought his things and said, “Have a good one.”

The clerk didn’t say anything except for a nod of acknowledgement. Jack noticed the man was not to be seen as he walked out from the store, but as he walked a few steps he spotted him sitting in a black Jeep Cherokee a few spots from him. He walked speedily to his car to leave and suddenly the man, a few paces away, noticed him again, calling out, “Hey, kid!”

“Thanks for the help anyway. Who knows what I would’ve done tonight. I don’t have much money. I’m pretty forgetful, wouldn’t you say?” he added, now looking at Jack with that strange look as before, except this time almost grinning and not breaking eye contact again.

Jack didn’t respond; he just needed to get into the car. He didn’t know what that was and didn’t care to find out by entertaining that conversation. He started to pull out, trying his best to avoid looking at the man still parked. He left and, while driving, felt an acute sense of paranoia that the man might be following him, not knowing what to expect at this point. As he started driving, the rain began to pick up again, setting the mood for something unsettling like this—coincidentally. He persisted, peering into his rearview window the entire way back home.
Jack was having a hard time shaking the image of the man’s grin and creepy interaction they had.


What felt like an eternity, Jack was finally arrived back to the house. Getting out of the car, he made his way to the front door, then immediately stopped and felt the need to put his car in the garage. He just didn’t want to be noticed, even though he felt his precautions of being seen were a bit dramatic. He got back in the car and pulled into the garage.

“I’m an idiot,” he thought, going through scenarios in his head and concluding it could’ve just been a strange man looking for his knife who was too talkative. “I don’t know, man—the way he looked at me was almost menacing, but regardless, that was sketchy,” he thought, almost finding room for humor in the situation. He felt relieved to be home at least and clicked the button to close the garage. Just as the garage was closing, he saw a black car drive by and made a momentary flash of eye contact with a man driving, wearing a hat, who gazed inside at him as the garage door was creeping down about a quarter of the way. The garage made its way shut.

Jack couldn’t tell with certainty if it was the man from earlier, but seeing a black car and the man inside appearing to wear a hat made his stomach sink and his body tense up with fear. His heartbeat raced for a brief moment at the eerie thought of the man passing by. Consequently, his mind started to piece together a bunch of reasons not to be worried. Thinking the man from earlier knew where he lived became the only thing he could think about. “What if he pulled back around and he’s in front of the house looking for me?” he thought. He frantically locked the garage door and took his bag of snacks up to his room, where he sat for a while, listening to the rain and looking out his bedroom window for anybody that could be at the house. There was nobody to be seen except for a few passing cars and the empty neighborhood.

Jack didn’t want to scare his parents by telling them what happened while they were so far away in Italy, so he texted Stephen and explained the situation. Thirty minutes went by with no response. Hours went by and Jack never left his window in fear of the man coming. He decided to get back on his games without his headset in order to hear anything going on outside that would raise any alarm in him. Stephen finally texted back just as Jack hopped into his first match of a different game called Fortnite. He felt partially relieved looking at Stephen’s text saying, “That’s creepy, man. I don’t think he’s out to get you though haha. Wanna hop on some games in a while?” “I’ll be home in a couple of hours.”

Jack knew Stephen couldn’t have known the severity of the situation, having not experienced it. “How could he not be creeped out and paranoid if he were in my shoes right now?” he thought. He would, Jack concluded, and the same worries came back and began to persist. A couple worried hours later he hopped on the games with Stephen around 7 p.m. Stephen had a long day of school and had gone out to dinner with some girl he recently met. As they were both playing Fortnite, Stephen asked, “Anything else happen since we talked?”

“Not really,” Jack replied. “I just keep thinking about it, but honestly I think I was tripping myself out thinking about it too much, if you know what I mean.”

“Yeah, I’m glad you answered my call and the guy didn’t get you,” Stephen replied jokingly.

Jack laughed and said, “No, for real—you should’ve seen me. I ran up to my room looking out the window for hours, thinking the dude was after me or something. Call me a lunatic or whatever, but in the moment I was ready to fight this guy if he pulled up to the house.”

“No, you wouldn’t,” Stephen said, laughing. “You’d be under your bed texting 911, let’s be real.”

“Nahhhh,” Jack said sarcastically, knowing he was probably right. They both laughed.

They continued playing for hours until Stephen had to go finish homework he was doing last second for his morning history class. They hung up the phone, and Jack was now alone but was left more at ease—either from Stephen’s jokes and downplaying the situation, poking fun at Jack’s overreaction, or just having another person to talk to to alleviate the end of Jack’s seemingly chaotic day.

There wasn’t much else to do. He had already talked to his parents that night and caught up on how things were going. He went to bed shortly after playing a few more games. The rain was settled but kept coming about in intermittent spurts. Something woke him—he heard a thud or a crack in the house he couldn’t make out, being mostly asleep. It wasn’t unusual for that to happen, he thought, and brushed it off. He then heard the sound of a car out front, and it was a neighbor pulling in across the street. Even after Jack’s relief, he still felt on edge and on high alert. The couple of sounds seemed to revive some anxiety that had vanished earlier. Lying in his bed, he looked out again, then one more time a few moments later out of paranoia and a last attempt of reassurance he could sleep soundly.

Another snap, the same as before, was heard in the house, only further. He nervously got up to investigate. In extreme hesitation, he poked his head looking towards the dim hallway. Jack gained some confidence and scoured the upstairs while turning the lights on. He looked out the windows of his parents’ room at the backyard, then peered out over the railing down to the downstairs hallway. I guess the house is just creaking and I’m being a little girl about it? Jack thought. In frustration, he turned the lights off, shut his bedroom door, locked it, and went to bed.

The midnight rain began to pick up again and into the night. It persisted as a soothing white noise, with Jack’s window being cracked. His frustrations before bed allowed him to put his worries behind him and sleep like the man of a household does—comfortably, but with one eye open, as they say. During Jack’s sleep, the sound of a slow-moving vehicle could be heard pulling up just across the street.

The sound of the car being put into park was enough to wake him again. Jack took a second to peer out his window, being as tired as he was and now flustered. He looked out and saw it was a black Jeep Cherokee parked on the other side of his house. His heart raced and he looked away from the window. Is it the guy? he asked himself with the utmost fear now settling in him. His hands were clammy, he went to look again, but nobody got out. The windows to the car were dark and he couldn’t make anything out from where he was. He laid back in bed, terrified of the thought of knowing the person saw him look out. If it was the man, then I assume he saw me trying to see if it was him. Knowing full well I’m terrified. What is this!? he thought to himself angrily and fearfully.

A car door then opened and shut, Jacks head lay against the wall on the foot of his. He couldn’t bear himself to look. Footsteps a moment later made their way toward the house in an offbeat rhythm and veered off to the left and stopped. Jack boldly made a peek out the window and couldn’t see anybody. What? What!? he said to himself quietly in immense confusion. Is he sneaking up on me? Jack wanted to confirm the front door was locked but couldn’t in fear of leaving his room. His mind was in right or flight. He needed to hear what was going on.

“Where did the man go?” Jack said quietly to himself, trembling. He could barely move a muscle, being too nervous to take a single step. He didn’t want a remnant of sound to be heard from his room. He sat there waiting and listening closely.

The faintest sound of the front door slowly swinging open could be heard from downstairs. Jack nearly fainted, his heart was beating out of his chest. He didn’t think the door was really unlocked but it had been. He stayed put in his room silently, with his whole body intensely sweating as the trepidation of the man below consumed him. 

There was no sound to be heard. Jack tried sliding his window open slowly while in a shaky haze, listening attentively to the sounds below. He quietly got the window fully open, and he waited there. The silence was ominous thing—it was unbearable. The man could suddenly be heard running to and up stairs. Jack froze, unable to move and the man now tried forcing the door open but couldn’t. Jack, still on the verge of screaming and fainting, noticed the man stopped. He heard him shuffle back a few paces away from the door. 

Jack, on the verge of collapse, listened, then—Snap!

Jack let out a yell. The man’s foot blasted through the door, making a huge opening, and the man got down on a knee to reach his left arm through the hole and up to unlock the latch on the other side of the door. He fiddled with the lock and pushed  the door open. Jack instinctively drew himself to the window, climbed out to the edge, and without much hesitation leaped from the second-story window to the grass. He rolled on his shoulder hard enough to feel quite injured on getting up, but he still had the ability to run for his life.

The man’s loud footsteps could be heard running down and smacking the wooden stairs in pursuit of Jack, who made a run for it as fast as he could. He made his way sprinting down the harrowing street of his neighborhood and could see the man in the distance wildly running after him. Jack almost started crying and yelled out, “Help!” loudly a couple of times as he tried keeping a steady gap between him and the man.

There wasn’t much use—the fact was nobody was awake to be immediate help. Jack kept his pace and he began to lose the man behind him, making his way around the corner to his local park. The man relentlessly followed around the corner, but Jack was already most of the way through the park passing pine trees and the dark empty playground. He now entered the other side of the neighborhood.

Exhausted from running, Jack now made it a few blocks down and hid behind some shrubs bordering the front of a neighbor’s house without being seen. “I’ll lay here and watch for a while”, he said, covered in sweat. His stomach and his arms now resting on the dirt, he laid there and watched from behind the shrub, hidden. Jack sat there lying for a few minutes until finally, the man—who he could see now was the one from before: six feet tall, the same jacket and denim pants along with a strange hat, was looking around aimlessly in search for Jack, now looking frustrated. Nearing closer in Jack’s direction, he could hear the man muttering words and swearing to find him.

“That fucki— that fucking kid, I’ll find him and kill him.”

His delirious state of mind and words just spoken startled Jack immensely. He couldn’t believe that was the same man from yesterday. He couldn’t believe he actually had vile intentions the entire time. It was all a sick trick, he thought to himself, thinking back to yesterday, trembling again. He watched as the man continued on, so Jack reached for his phone. It was at home on his bed.

“Damnit!” he whispered. “It makes sense—I did leave suddenly, but not grabbing it at a time like this?”

Jack allowed for a few more minutes to pass with the idea in mind to make his way back home, hoping he could build up the courage to. A few more minutes passed—it was time. He slowly crept upward about halfway, making a few glances of confirmation and started walking toward the street. He wanted to run, but if the man was near he thought he’d run into him unexpectedly or draw attention to the sound of himself if he wasn’t walking cautiously. The streetlights gave an incandescent and eerie feel as he made his way along down the street towards the park. It had stopped raining as before but a light sprinkle could be felt as Jack proceeded for home.

He passed through the park to his side of the neighborhood. Not once had a car passed he noticed, and at an instant, a cat made its way across the street, startling Jack. He continued walking and his steps grew at a faster pace as he was approaching his house looking around both sides of the street, paranoid. He ran up, locked the front door with haste, and quickly got upstairs. He grabbed his phone from his bed and walked downstairs. He was peering out the living room windows, keeping watch for the man, as he called 911.

He saw something outside—he couldn’t make it out, it was hard to tell in the dark of night what it was. “Hurry and pick up please , please” he said, with extreme impatience. The operator answered. “Hello, this is 911, what is your emergency?”

Jack gave a quick summary of what happened at 7-Eleven with the mysterious man. He quickly summarized the initial interaction, the man passing moments later in his car, seeing his house, and the later visiting him that evening and how he snuck up into the house, to his room and chased him out and down the street. The operator listened attentively taking notes and asking further questions.

“Can you give me a description of what this man looks like?”

Jack turned away from the window, giving the reply. 

The man was staring at Jack with his hallow eyes from behind the corner wall of the kitchen who’d been waiting for him to enter the house to kill him. He was smiling insanely with his pocket knife in hand.

“Ahhhhhhh!” Jack screamed and cried, dropping his phone. He picked up a two-foot candlestick stand nearest to him at the window. 

The man took a step forward, making himself fully visible, and ran at Jack with a sinister and crooked look. Jack swung as he neared, hitting his side. The man tried grabbing Jack’s shirt, but Jack barely slipped away l running toward the dining table. The man followed laughing, running around swinging his knife towards Jack, slashing his arm from across the table. Jack yelled out in pain as he got into a desperate position away toward the far side of the table. The clean slash on his arm was bleeding badly. The table gave a few feet of distant between them. The man stood there wide eyed and suddenly climbed up on top knocking everything over on the table. He stepped over toward Jack in another attempt to grab him but Jack smacked his arm away and ran toward the stairs. The man leaped off the table running quickly after him.

The man was faster and caught up to Jack grabbing him by the shirt, ready to stab him near the top of the stairs. Jack then spun around quickly, in a full 180 degrees, and swung the candle stand with all his might and struck the man badly on the side of the head. The man immediately dropped to the steps at Jacks feet, bleeding, and tumbled down to the bottom of the stairs to the living room floor. He lay there unconscious. 

Jack started sobbing profusely. “What just happened?” He said as he continued sobbing in shock of what happened and what he just did to the man. This went on for a moment but then couldn’t endure another second of being at the top of the stairs looking down at the man. He didn’t know for sure if he was dead or not but he appeared like it. Jack ran down the stairs, wiping his tears, and grabbed the knife off the floor that the man dropped after being hit, and called 911 again. He made the call from the sidewalk, looking into his house with the front door open.

He was traumatized and couldn’t bear being in the vicinity of the man who was likely dead. The cops were stunned by the situation. Jack’s parents and his friends later couldn’t believe what happened that night. Most of all, Jack couldn’t believe it. He was sitting there partially in delirium and a haze as the authorities made their way inside to investigate the scene. Jack stayed outside with a few cops who comforted him and asked a series of questions. He then received assistance from a peri medic to address his gash on his arm from getting cut earlier. The man was declared dead due to the mighty blow to the head with the candle stand. Jack was thinking how such a seemingly perfect day turned into a nightmare yet how lucky he was to have managed to stay alive. He thought how going to a 7 Eleven now wouldn’t be the same anymore or even just being at home alone. The prior worries Jack had of the man were now justified with the event’s that played out that evening. This moment never departed Jack’s memory, but the lasting trauma improved with time, and he went on to venture into those things we mentioned in the beginning of the story with success.

That day Jack learned a couple things: trust your instincts and never, never leave your front door unlocked.

The End.

1nlf9un,https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/1nlf9un/lutheran_soteriology_and_a_clear_conscious/,Lutheran Soteriology and a clear conscious,"Hello. Im in my early 20s and recently I have been interested in the Lutheran church. My entire family and background is Lutheran. I’ve tried my very hardest not to land on being Lutheran but to no avail. I suffer from what you would call Religious OCD/Scrupulosity. I’ve had manic episodes where I had to be rushed to the hospital (I was quitting certain substances at the time but the reactions were not normal considering the things I was doing were not that strong compared to other drugs) and it turns out that Martin Luther had the same issue. Lutheran theology eases my weak mind. I do have certain things I disagree with the LCMS:

1. The closed communion thing I never really am able to wrap my head around

2. I tend to lean towards evolution being true though I am sort of agnostic about it. 

3. I am a little more charismatic, from what I have heard, Lutherans tend to stay away from that kind of stuff (though Im very careful not to fall into being superstitious)

4. I lean towards Annihilationism as a more biblical view of hell. 

5. I’m agnostic on the soteriology particularity if it pertains to everybody. This is the one I’m most worried about. I know for a fact there is absolutely no way I could have freed myself. Certain situations arose that I had no control over that led me to where I am today. But I know that because my brain is broken. Martin Luther wasn’t given a diagnosis. So did he assume everybody struggled like this to varying degrees? It seems like some people have more “free will” than others. The guy with bipolar disorder who needs to be caught with fishnets at 3 in the morning definitely looks like he has less free will compared to your average Joe sipping coffee across the street. Do people have varying degrees of “free will” when it comes to faith? On top of that, wether this is a good thing or not, I tend to take a lot of comfort in antiquity. From what I’ve seen, up until Augustine, EVERY early church father was a synergist. I’ve tried to find quotes from early church fathers that support something like a Lutheran view but every time you find one quote it seems like 10 other quotes from the same father rule out a monergistic explanation. Some church fathers if I remember right, even seem to call the monergistic approach heresy. Now I know the reason why they would call it heresy is because a hard deterministic approach (like a reformed view) would make God the author of evil. I know Lutherans are infralapsarians. I also understand the Lutheran views the terms “predestination” and “election” differently and that we don’t have free will specifically to what pertains to salvation. But at the same time, Im not sure, I can only speak for myself and my experience, not anyone else’s. If free will exists to turn to God, I definitely don’t have it. And if I do I have very very little of it and I would rather give God more credit that more credit to myself. So I hold the Lutheran Soteriology with some doubt. This would be kind of a leap of faith. 

I know that I could never become a pastor or teacher in the LCMS but I was wondering if I am still able to adhere to the small catechism and keep a clean conscious with these views as a layperson. Of course I wouldn’t go around trying to convince people of my views, I take church authority seriously and I’m willing to lay aside my personal disagreements to submit to the leaders. But I wanted to make sure on here. I will also be talking to a LCMS Pastor soon to get more information.

God bless

After getting home from that dreadful gig, I went straight to sleep.  Nightmares followed. When I woke up, I smelled French perfume – the same perfume worn by a certain redhead – on my pillows.

Nothing made sense. Part of me didn’t believe what had happened. Inferno? What kind of nightclub was that? I went online and did some research, but nothing was conclusive. My town is seedy – this is well known – but monsters? Really?

Actually, it kinda made sense. An awful lot of people go missing around here – sometimes violently – but no one says a peep. I thought it was the mafia. A monster mafia, perhaps?

The day was deplorable. I did everything I could to distract myself, to slow down time, but nothing helped. In a few short hours I was expected to return to the monster bar. I dreaded the thought. Reluctantly, I regarded the song list that the boss had given me. Songs like: Slow Train to Deathsville didn’t do much to comfort me. Same goes for: Crossroads after Dark, and The Devil Owns My Soul. These aren’t real songs, I told myself, after my ninth cup of coffee. The list was stupid. They were setting me up.

The day raced by. I nearly chickened out, but as six o'clock approached, I took an Uber to the nightclub; I wanted it on record where I was going. Just in case.

The club was darker than I’d remembered. And foul-smelling. The marble floor was sticky. Part of me was hoping for a miracle: that I’d be greeted by normal human beings. Heck, even cracked-out lowlifes would suffice. But that’s not what happened.

“Need anything, Hank?” the bartender asked in his bottomless voice. His skin was paper-pale, his dark hair slicked back. He really could pass for Dracula, only taller. No normal person could be that tall.

I tried speaking, but nothing came out. He shrugged, and went about serving a bunch of lizard people who were gathered around the bar.

The grand piano greeted me with a groan. My heart was racing. Already, I was sweating. Stupid fireplace. If I see that redhead, I’m gonna….

What? What was I gonna do?

My mind was a blender. All these conflicting emotions surfaced. That a band of ogres were mocking me didn’t help. “What are you?” they shouted, “some kind of moron?” Someone in the back hollered, “He’s a penis, not a pianist!” To which another monster replied: “I guess size DOES matter!”

I shot out of my seat and raced to the bar. I was parched. Remembering how murky the tap water was, I asked for a chilled bottle. The bartender looked at me like I was food. Dinner, perhaps. He poured me a pint of weak-looking beer, then he resumed chatting with the lizards, who were licking their faces with long, sickly tongues.

I took a sip of beer, dreading what would happen next. Surely, I’d be poisoned. But hey, if I’m gonna die and have my head strung up on the wall, so be it. Let’s get this over with, shall we? The beer was warm, but other than that, it was fine. I breathed a sigh of relief, and sat down at the piano bench.

“Slow Train to Deathsville!” one of the trolls yelled, followed by a chorus of chuckling.

“In the key of death!”

The monsters grew restless, smashing their mugs on the tables. A two-headed giant with teeth like hockey sticks was waving a butcher’s knife. I didn’t trust the look in his eyes. Clearly, he was a madman. The audience was growing rowdier by the minute. I was transfixed, unable to move. They were so ugly, it was incomprehensible.

“Didn’t ya mamma tell ya it’s rude to stare?” someone shouted over the noise.

“We should slow-torture him.”

“Like the last guy!”

Clearly, they meant business. The barroom walls were lined with severed heads, after all. Probably, musicians. Like me. I took a deep breath, and gathered my nerves. When my shaky hands touched the piano keys, I shrieked. The keys were bones. A beer whizzed over my head, and shattered. More insults were slung.

A grim looking ghoul approached me, slow and deliberate. It looked like a zombie: dead on the outside, mean-spirited on the inside. The zombie’s eyes were tiny slits of murder, its hands clutching a cleaver. My mind went blank. Suddenly, I’d forgotten every song I’d learned: it was like I’d never touched a piano in my life. Moments before the zombie could slice my head off and hang it on a mantle, a giant boom blasted throughout the barroom.

The redhead appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. With her was the big, bald-headed boss. The same boss who turned into a dragon the previous night. Same boss who handed me a list of songs that don’t exist. Not in this world, anyhow.

“QUIET!” the redhead hollered, standing in the middle of the dancefloor.

The room shushed.

“Let Hank play.”

She wore a long, flowing nightgown that left little to the imagination. Her luscious lips matched her fiery hair. She turned to me and my heart melted. She strutted towards a nearby table and sat with a bunch of ogres the size of football stadiums. The zombie – now within striking distance – frowned. It lowered its weapon, and plopped down at the nearest table, but its soulless eyes never left mine.

The monsters – fifty, perhaps – were staring at me. Drops of drool splashed across their filthy faces. I groaned. So did my stomach. The beer wasn’t sitting well with me. This is it, I realized, do or die. I closed my eyes, and launched into the Adam’s Family theme, figuring they’d either love it, or they’d kill me. Their response was meek, at best. Jeesh. Tough crowd. As I sang Die With A Smile, by Lady Gaga, the doors burst open.

Everyone turned.

A gang of ghouls entered, carrying a vast array of weapons: guns that looked like relics from the Civil War. They were lizard people, similar to the ones sitting at the bar. They were hairless creatures; their skin was sickly green with a tinge of yellow, and they wore matching cowboy hats and boots. Their attire was ridiculous, like a band of psychobillies.

Their leader leapt onto a table and ordered everyone to shut up. “Where’s Tony?” he shouted, his voice sounding like AI.

Nobody spoke.

A grotesque grin stretched across his leathery lips. His tongue was forked, like a snake, and his eyes were on the side of his head.

“Maybe y’all didn’t hear me?” He kicked the drinks off the table. “Maybe y’all are too STUPID!”

The redhead (I still hadn’t learned her name) and her boss vanished. The trolls started trembling, the ogres snorting soggy tears. I grimaced. There’s nothing less satisfying than being surrounded by a pack of scared-to-death monsters.

The gang leader tipped his cowboy hat. Then he leapt off the table and ran towards the bar. “Ivan!” he shouted at the bartender. “Fix us some drinks, why don’t ya? Got a feeling we’re gonna be here for a while.”

Nobody spoke. The only sound was the bartender preparing drinks.

I slouched as low as possible, trying to make myself invisible.

A henchman stood up, and everyone turned. “You gonna pay for them?” The henchmen puffed out his chest. He was huge, twice the size of the leathery lizards. The henchman approached the intruders; he was carrying an axe which looked razor-sharp.

“Tough guy, eh?” the leader said. “Yeeha!” He fired a blast into the ceiling. Many monsters hit the ground.

The intruders – six of them, I believe, but it’s difficult to say because they were going in and out of focus – surrounded the henchman. The lizard people sitting at the bar joined them, guns drawn.

With remarkable speed, the henchman swung his axe. The leader ducked, but not quick enough. His hat flew off, and his olive head rolled along the dancefloor, stopping at my feet.

The lifeless lizard’s body collapsed into a pool of blood.

The intruders open-fired. Bullets whizzed. More blood was spilled. I slid underneath the piano, scared out of my mind. The cowpoke’s head was staring at me, glossy eyed and dripping with gooey black slime.

Monsters were stabbing and killing and screeching and quarrelling. The sound was tremendous, like a warzone. Those leather-clad lizards zipped along the walls like trained assassins, shooting the monsters point blank. A pixie’s head exploded with fireworks of blood. A troll's eyes were shot out; a grumble of maggots ejected from the soggy sockets. Its towering body tumbled onto the table, which broke in half.

The baldheaded boss reappeared out of nowhere; he spoke in a strange language. Suddenly, gas sifted out of the walls. So, this is how I die, I remember thinking: poisoned to death.

The gas filled the room.

The boss transformed into a dragon; he spat furious flames. The flames mixed with the gas, creating a giant explosion. Shrieks of terror filled the barroom. The entire gang of ghouls perished. Monsters melted and moaned. The smell was atrocious, like a rotten egg factory burning down. Everyone died, except the boss, the redhead, and Ivan, the bartender. And little ol’ me, of course, who was hiding next to a blood-leaking lizard’s brain.

What followed next was a silence so thick, you could stab it with a fork. I didn’t dare move from my hiding spot. The blood-soaked dancefloor was teeming with hapless corpses so vile and disgusting, it’s impossible to describe. Tables were torn to shreds. Drinks spilled. Glasses shattered. Flashes of fire flickered. Blood was dripping from the ceiling, which was over sixteen-feet high. Miraculously, the piano was unscathed.

“Well,” the boss said, wiping black goop from his slacks, “that was fun.”

His bootheels clicked as he approached the piano bench; they sounded like bombs.

“Hank,” he spat, “hand me that head, why don’t you?”

I gulped.

“And pick yourself up!” He kicked the piano. “This is a classy joint.”

The head was as heavy as a horse. It looked like a giant, inflated football covered in gore. My hands were crimson and cold. I was crying.

“Oh, Hank,” the redhead said in a lonesome voice. “Play us a song. Something happy.”

“Slow Train to Deathsville,” the boss snapped.

Oh, how I hated that song.

The boss ordered a cleanup, and to my surprise, the kitchen crew sprang from the back room and got to work. Speedily, they hauled the dead monsters away. Minutes later, a few stranglers walked in: a pair of shadow-creatures sat in the front row, where moments ago, a grim-faced ogre died. I didn’t bother taking a set break – I was way too scared – so I played every song I knew, starting with Folsom Prison Blues.

More monsters arrived. They started heckling me, but I barely noticed. I was stuck in Survival Mode. By nine o'clock, the place cleared out, and I ended my set with Maxwell’s Silver Hammer, by the Beatles. By now, the redhead is sitting next to me on the bench, purring like a cat. From my peripheral vision, she looked like a witch. Warts and all.

The barroom stank like death and alcohol. I desperately wanted to go home and shower. Get this grime off me. There was zero chance I was ever setting foot in this place again. Fool me once, as they say.

“Rough night!” Ivan said gleefully, as he wiped a glob of blood from a barstool. His teeth were stained red. His fingernails were extremely long and tobacco-colored.

A cold hand touched my shoulder. “Here ya go, Hank.” The boss handed me an envelope; it was lighter than the previous night. “You didn’t learn the songs on the list.” His bald head was bulging with veins.

“Those songs,” I said carefully, not wanting my anger to reach a boiling point, “don’t exist!” My legs were shaking.

Tony, the boss, shrugged. He turned, and kissed the redhead egregiously. His erection was poking from his fine-Italian slacks. The redhead seemed pleased by this, and grabbed it with both hands.

I felt sick to my stomach. Watching monsters make out was not on my TO DO list. As quietly as humanly possible, I edged towards the exit, pondering this horrific gig. The flight upstairs seemed like an eternity. I swear there were more stairs than before. I was out of breath when I reached the exit.

“No way I’m coming back,” I muttered to no one, as I left.

“Sure you are,” a shriveled voice replied.

I stopped dead in my tracks.

“If you don’t,” the severed head said, gazing down at me from above the door. “You’ll end up like [me!""](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/s/DXBkskIyr5)",2,1758315380.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

The Brondell RF-40 Membrane Water Filter has found a permanent place under my kitchen sink over the past several months. As someone who drinks gallons of water throughout the day, the promise of cleaner, better-tasting water was too good to pass up. This filter, made for the Brondell Circle Reverse Osmosis Under Sink Water Filtration System, claims to reduce heavy metals, cysts, fluoride, arsenic, and a long list of other contaminants. Beyond just that, I'll admit—I was equally intrigued by its Water Quality Association certification, a label that doesn't just get handed out for nothing. After testing it consistently, I have formed a bond with the filter but also uncovered specific quirks.

**Ease of Installation and Setup**

One of the first things I noticed about this water filter was the simplicity of its installation process. I'm no plumber, so I was a little nervous about getting it set up initially. However, the “twist-and-seal” mechanism turned out to be as straightforward as advertised. Pop out the old one, twist in the new one, and voilà—it was good to go in under ten minutes flat. I didn’t even glance at the manual because the process felt ridiculously intuitive. My coworker Gary, who swapped his filter the same week, confirmed what I suspected: this system is far less intimidating than the alternatives he’s used. The filter replacement indicator is another cherry on top, though replacing the indicator's battery might unnecessarily complicate things.

[Find the best price for Brondell RF-40 on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b012upeaqm/)

**Performance in Action: Is It Worth the Hype?**

After installation, I found myself marveling at the quality of the water. The taste alone sold me within the first sip. This water doesn’t get that ""flat"" aftertaste that standard filters often fail to eliminate; it genuinely made my morning coffee pop with flavor. The filtration claims are another impressive feature backed by its NSF/ANSI certification for reducing 64 contaminants. My kids, who are all about that “taste test challenge” on Saturdays, could instantly tell the difference between tap water and the newly filtered water. Even better, they started drinking more water just because, in their words, “it tastes amazing.” I can’t argue with that kind of endorsement.

**Durability and Lifespan**

According to its description, the Brondell RF-40 is designed to last six months, and I can confirm the timeline holds true with regular usage. In the past, I’ve been let down by filters that either degrade in performance or clog prematurely. This one didn't lose pace even as we went through some heavy summer use when hydration seemed like a round-the-clock necessity. By month five, the water quality started showing slight signs of a drop-off, but that’s about the time the indicator light came on. Ultimately, six months is a realistic estimate for average users.

**Good Points**

- NSF/ANSI-certified for reducing 64 contaminants  
- Incredibly simple twist-and-seal installation  
- Improved taste noticeable even by non-filter snobs  
- Filter change indicator ensures you don’t guess maintenance timelines  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The replacement indicator’s battery needs frequent changing  
- Slightly pricier compared to competitors' under-sink options  
- Filter life declines faster in households with heavy users  

**Competing Brands**

Water filters are as numerous as minor inconveniences in adulthood, so picking the right one can feel overwhelming. For comparison, I’ve had some experience with the APEC Water Filter and iSpring models, both formidable competitors. The APEC model comes at a lower upfront cost but lacks the compact, intuitive design of the Brondell RF-40. iSpring, on the other hand, offers a comparable level of filtration but without the built-in indicator light, which can leave users guessing about maintenance. What sets the Brondell apart is its balance of performance, user-friendly features, and overall reliability. 

Certainly, alternate products might edge out in some specific departments—perhaps offering more multi-stage filtration options or longer lifespans. But for ease of use combined with effective filtration, Brondell’s design stands out. Is it perfect? Maybe not, but it’s a strong contender.

**Best Value?**

Considering this product caters to those prioritizing water quality without advanced plumbing, it offers great ""value for money."" While it runs slightly higher in cost than non-RO systems, the performance it delivers in terms of taste and contaminant reduction justifies the difference. Judging from my conversations with others using RO systems, the middle-ground pricing aligns well with comparable products in its class. If you're seeking effective water filtration without worrying about technical installations or intrusive designs, this product gives you your money’s worth.

This isn't a “let’s see where it goes” kind of post — I’m looking for someone emotionally mature, kind, and genuinely interested in building a life rooted in mutual respect, loyalty, and emotional depth.

I have a stable job in a bank, and I’m educated. I intend to go for further education in the future (eg an additional master or DBA).

I'm someone who values emotional connection, honesty, and clear communication. I'm drawn to people who are warm, generous, and thoughtful — not flashy or impulsive, but steady, sincere, and grounded. You might be someone who's taken your time, grown through your own challenges, and come out the other side with a big heart and an open mind.

I deeply care about mental health, calmness, living a zen life. I know, we all live with chaos, but I’m looking for that energy that can turn around my life in a way that we complement each other and able to face challenges together.

You don't need to be perfect (who is?), but if you're the kind of man who takes responsibility, communicates well, respects both tradition and individuality, and believes in partnership — I’d love to hear from you.


Bonus if you have a sense of humour, emotional intelligence, and know the value of a simple, peaceful life together.

I do have a dark sense of humour. I am also introvert, so it is quite difficult for me to go outside in real life to look for someone. I prefer to be behind my screen. Believe me, I do hate the way this is. But i still believe that I will find the right person one day, no matter how long and how difficult it is.

Other facts: Though I am in the banking sector, I know it is not my true calling. One day I also hope that I will be doing something I am passionate about, like owing a small coffee shop with a bookshop, or a lovely boutique or something that brings peace to my mind.

I love arts, crafts, puzzles, travelling to admire sculpture/ gallery/ beautiful sceneries. I also love cooking and try new cuisine. I like activities such as going to concerts, enjoying orchestras/ theatres, and walking in the nature.


Let’s start slow, talk about life, dreams, values. If something meaningful grows from there — even better.

1nlf4ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/sicily/comments/1nlf4ja/wont_be_back_to_sicily/,Won’t be back to Sicily,"Once again I apologize for being an American.  I’m sorry that’s all I know but I do know that I don’t like trash every where, dead animals on the sidewalk, graffiti, insane drivers that make you want to drink while driving, lack of order, chaos, getting hustled by vendors, no instructions, misleading hotel, Airbnbs, etc.  Basically if you like Tijuana, you’ll love Sicily.  Ripped off getting gas, etc.  huge lack of “hospitality and customer service”, extreme heat, smells of all kinds including sewage, mold, and more.  We traveled around the entire island and my conclusion is if you value safety, service, and hospitality-don’t come here.  Most people are bothered that you’re here and don’t speak English.  I did everything I could to connect with google translate, talking to locals, researching for endless hours before coming and still was traumatized.  People will sit and smoke cigarettes on break when there’s a huge line to pay to go to the beach at a “club” where they are “supposed” to have some service of cocktails and food which never happened.  We had a roommate in our “entire unit” from Airbnb with no separate entry or barrier-and total lack of privacy with a smoke filled unit, moldy pillows, no shade on the “beautiful patio” of the beach-again it was 95 degrees Fahrenheit, and left out the pictures of the dilapidated building across the street, trash everywhere, and mostly inhospitable merchants.  I felt like a bother the entire time here and if you are UBER rich-you can be in your tour bubble and pay 10K for an 8 day stay which I found out from a couple traveling here.  They never saw anything but the best of Italy and were sheltered from the extremes we experienced here.  When Expedia, Booking.com, Google, or Airbnb give excellent ratings BEWARE because most of what they say is untrue.  Look closer, ask more questions, be very proactive in trouble shoot that yes indeed there is a/c IN EVERY ROOM-if it matters to you, that you will have the “entire place to yourself”, and don’t expect instructions how to use any appliances with directions like making a cup of coffee, turning on the oven, etc.  All I can say is it is very hard work to travel here unless you speak Italian/act look Italian, you’re very comfortable camping, or are UBER rich.  Forget online maps as most businesses don’t seem to have correct addresses listed.  When you do find the nice people here which there are, they will be shocked if they ask you how your stay was here and honestly it’s exhausting to talk about anymore.  Just know if you are used to modern, working appliances, sanitary conditions, and true customer service, you will have to look hard.  Get a travel agent if you want a totally enjoyable trip-someone that has “boots on the ground” in case of hiccups which there were so many.  Finally, I say this-safety is not the same as we are used to.  I was stuck in a bathroom of a 5 star resort for 20 minutes because the lock stuck Due to LACK OF MAiNTAINANCE and to me, lack of care.  Nobody came to my cries for help and fearful of being accused of damaging company property I persisted in knocking and yelling for help.  I learned nobody is going to watch out for you here so you better save yourself.  After taking a cold shower to calm down from my panic  and and hurting myself to try to get the lock to open, I grabbed the toilet cleaner handle top and used it as a tool to bang on the lock enough to finally get it open.  The massage therapist at the spa apologized for not hearing me-where was she?  Who knows they’re all under staffed and overwhelmed but after my massage which she told me to relax while pressing so hard on my bladder I thought I was going to pee everywhere she asked “now how do you feel”.  Of course I said better but then she said ralax and take your time but I have another client right after you (so basically hurry up and get the f out) which we found very common here.  I then went back into the dry sauna where she came in and stuck her phone in my face and said “you have one minute left and please if you liked our service give me a review on google”.  Oh and she offered me some chocolate.  This is just one example of the many awful “extremes” I experienced here.  Of course I found beautiful and amazing sights and people while here that are absolutely incredible and will forever be treasured and cherished but I never ever had to work so hard or deal with so much bullsh@t in my life on a vacation and won’t ever do it again.  I love people, the arts, the ancient sights and beautiful places that I discovered along my 16 day journey around this place.  I do my best to integrate and be a polite, conscientious, and friendly “tourist” and actually shocked many locals with my warmth and humor but most of them wouldn’t give me the time of day.  We traveled 5K+ miles to be here, see and experience the beauty of Sicily, and had to walk through fire here.  I don’t want to have to work this hard to go on vacation EVER again.  Please don’t give me shit for saying this and if you are from Sicily and I’ve offended you, please know that I have been offended here over and over and over again and I do mean it when I say I mostly felt unwelcomed here.  We came here with Italians from Sicily and all of this was unknown to them.  When you can’t navigate from point A to B, make a cup of coffee in the am, get lost a million times in extreme heat, get cancelled activities over and over again, and no one can truly help you, rent a frickin scooter and at least you’ll get somewhere fast with the breeze in your hair and will be able to taste a bit of the magic that they all talk about here in Sicily.

Looking for my future favorite person. I want a real, long-term relationship. We can start online and see where it goes. USA/Japan only.

The absolute 20/10 (jk) posting this: https://imgur.com/a/pictures-XdqmQIl

A little about me: I'm the type of guy that would give you a shiny Pokémon I found just to see you smile. A bit of a hopeless romantic. I value traditional things like patience, loyalty, and honesty. I'm an honors student going for my Master's in English: Creative Writing, so my love letters will be world class obviously. I'm also pretty athletic myself, and I'm a big mental and physical health advocate. My dream is to be a fantasy author one day, to write stories and characters that help people be inspired by or find comfort in.

What I bring to a relationship: Bookstore, coffee shop, or park dates in person. Home cooked meals. Online we could have calls watching anime, talking, gaming, reading, or anything else interesting! Your parents will so approve of me too, but might call me a yapper. My long-term goal is that I'm considering teaching English in Japan one day. Plus you get my game and book collections AND someone who you can rant about things to.

The woman I'm looking for: You're a kind, loyal woman who shares my values and isn't into hookup culture. You enjoy nerdy things, meaningful talks, and being best friends with their partner. I'm most drawn to someone healthy, slim, or athletic, with a sweet face and eyes I can fall for. You want a genuine bond.

Some of my hobbies are writing, gaming, cooking, anime, weightlifting, and long walks in nature. Some major faves are Final Fantasy, Pokémon, NieR:Automata, Baldur's Gate, and pretty much any RPG. I also read (and write) fantasy! Think like Lord of the Rings, Mistborn, but also Star Wars novels. I'd love to find someone to do cosplay with, maybe a Cloud x Tifa/Aerith or something!

I'm in Indiana (EST) and open to online in the US but also in Japan. So if you love calm calls, shared hobbies, and want a lasting connection, please feel free to message. I mainly use discord and will be most active there if we talk. Have a good day.

1nlezcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KingSwingsPlay/comments/1nlezcd/swing_sets_for_older_kids/,Swing Sets for Older Kids,"Designing a swing set for older kids can be challenging, but with the right approach, you can create a play space that keeps them engaged and active. In this post, we’ll cover the key factors to consider when designing a swing set or playhouse that truly works for older children. These insights apply to any swing set—not just [King Swings](/bring-the-playground-home-with-king-swings)—helping you feel confident in your choices.

In this discussion, we assume the youngest child in the home is around six years old and up. What makes a great swing set for older kids, and how can you [customize a playset](/the-ultimate-guide-to-customizing-your-vinyl-swing-set) to suit their needs? (If you want options for younger kids, check out our [Best Swing Sets for Toddlers](https://kingswingsets.com/blog/best-swing-set-for-toddlers/) blog post!)

While every family’s needs differ, a few core principles apply to designing playsets for older kids. Let’s explore those.

#  Your Swing Set Space

 Headspace is important when adding items below the tower. For example, a 5' tower with a decked bottom only has 4' between the 2' x 6's. That is not a lot of headspace for a growing child.

As you increase the tower height, the headspace grows. If you consider putting a coffee bar or clubhouse under your tower for older kids, I suggest making it at least 6' tall. This will give them 5' of headspace under the tower.

Space can also mean the size of the swing set. Older kids generally play more advanced and active games than younger kids, so they want more towers, climbers, and bridges to play tag, use Nerf blasters, or run obstacle courses.

Pictured here is a 7' Deck Height with an 8' x 11' playdeck on the [Enclave Playhouse Swing Set](https://kingswingsets.com/product/the-enclave-swing-set/).

#  Your Swing Set Height

 It also impacts your swing beam options. I recommend a 10’ high beam for older kids, which allows for a much higher, more thrilling swing than the standard 8’ beam.

Pictured here is a 7' Deck Height with a play deck on the [Enclave Playhouse Swing Set](https://kingswingsets.com/product/the-enclave-swing-set/).

Check out two new designs for 2025 with 10"" swing beams: [Laurel Playhouse Swing Set](https://kingswingsets.com/product/hazel-playhouse/) and [Hazel Playhouse Swing Set, ](https://kingswingsets.com/product/laurel-playhouse/)and a best seller with 8' swing beams, [Cubby's Fort Swing Set.](https://kingswingsets.com/product/new-cubbys-fort/)

#  Your Backyard Swing Set's Swings

I’ve noticed that my kids, ages 9 and 10, are big fans of swings with wild, circular motion. While they all love classic belt swings, the real excitement comes from a swing they can pile onto together and get moving—that’s when the fun happens!

Consider having our team install a swivel hook in the center of your swing beam to add more dynamic play. You may want to remove other swings from the beam to prevent collisions when using free-range motion swings like these.

The swivel hook will allow you to attach a [**3-rope tire swing**](https://kingswingsets.com/product/3-rope-tire-swing/). Another great option that uses two swing positions is our [**heavy-duty** **web swing**](https://kingswingsets.com/product/web-swing/). These swings can hold multiple kids at once or provide a cozy spot for a child to lie down and gently swing while reading.

If you have a bookworm in the family, adding a [**hammock swing**](https://kingswingsets.com/product/hammock-swing/) in a fourth position creates the perfect relaxation spot.

#  Your Swing Set Design: Put it into Practice

 Now that we have explored a few important concepts when designing a playset for older children, let’s examine a few standard models and why they are suitable for older kids.

# [Wave Rider Swing Set](https://kingswingsets.com/product/new-wave-rider/)

The Wave Rider is an excellent set for older kids. It is 7’ tall and spacious, with that high beam, tall climber, and slide built right into it. My suggestion for this set is to change the super spiral slide to either a turbo tube or a tunnel express slide. Those slides are more big-kid-friendly.

# [The Chateau Playhouse](https://kingswingsets.com/product/the-chateau/)

The Chateau is another great set for older kids right out of the package. It is 7’ tall and has lots of space for various games. I suggest increasing the towers' size to give a bit more space.

# [Eclipse Swing Set ](https://kingswingsets.com/product/the-eclipse/)

The Eclipse Swing Set is unique to this list as the only one with a double-deck tower. This means if you have younger children, this set is excellent for them, too! The Eclipse Swing Set has a 5' and 7’ tall tower, a monkey bar swing beam, and three great slides! I suggest increasing the back tower to 6’ x 6’ to give that upper tower a bit more space, which will also increase the space of the clubhouse below.

#  Conclusion

When shopping for or designing the best swing set for older kids, remember to look for tall towers with lots of head space under the roof and the tower itself. Choose taller swing beams, faster slides, and more challenging climbers. All playsets at King Swings are made-to-order, so they can be customized to your family's needs. To learn more about customization, visit our [Ultimate Guide to Customization Blog](/the-ultimate-guide-to-customizing-your-vinyl-swing-set). 

Remember that you know your child the best. If your child is a reader, design a little nook with a hammock swing to provide a comfy place to read outside. Or, quite the opposite, if your children are adventurous and turn everything into an obstacle course, add in lots of tunnels, slides, and climbers to keep it exciting!

King Swings crafts high-quality, durable, made-to-order swing sets. We build fully customizable premium swing sets and playhouses with the highest craftsmanship and safety standards. Our modern designs and imaginative accessories will inspire backyard play and discovery for the whole family.

When I was a Citadel associate, I was working in Surveyor Capital - a fundamental equities shop.

I asked the PM one day how he actually sized his positions.

Did it involve working closely with the quant team to analyze all the Monte Carlo simulations and option Greeks?

Did it involve discussions with the economists on the macro team to understand the regime dynamics?

Did it involve going to conferences with the portfolio companies and taking management out for dinner?

He smirked, and told me: “that’s all bullshit dude.”

Here’s what he actually does.

. . .

It’s called the Kelly criterion and it basically gives you the optimal size to bet without blowing up your portfolio.

Kelly fraction = expected return / expected vol squared

That’s it.

So if you expect a stock to deliver 20% with a volatility of 40%, the Kelly fraction is 1.25 or 125% of your portfolio.

The PM told me he usually runs at 1/8 Kelly due to the large drawdowns in his tech names and the fund’s concentration limitations, so about 16% here.

He also mentioned this is the same exact formula his buddies at Viking and Altimeter use. Except they run much higher Kelly fractions using leverage, and don’t have such tight position limits.

Apparently, Warren Buffet sizes using Kelly-like methods.

Ngl was smirking myself by the end of our convo.

. . .

Fast forward 12 years - happily retired with a wife in fashion (occasional runway), kid & dog - and this morning sipping coffee and writing this, I noticed something…

Kelly fraction = (expected return / expected vol) / expected vol
= expected sharpe / expected vol

Shit, that’s it?!

It just tells you to bet more when you have an edge (sharpe) and bet less when the game is riskier?

I laughed.

1nlesfn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nlesfn,"Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn - Furnished Room - Short Term OK!","Woman and small, feisty dog offer a furnished room on a month-to-month basis. Ideal for someone transitioning to the city or between situations. But, if it proves to be truly a good fit, open to long term as well. Deposit, $1300/mo + $250 includes utilities, once-a-month housekeeper, shared incidentals (toilet paper/dish soap/trashbags etc).



The Location

Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. Steps from the Bergen F/G (so very convenient access to BK and Manhattan), and at least two CitiBike stations. Butchers and bakeries holding strong from the days when this was an Italian neighborhood (this is the neighborhood from the movie Moonstruck), cobblers, cheese shops, gyms, a YMCA with a pool, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, mostly small independently owed businesses, but also a Trader Joe's. There is street parking, and alternate side parking on most streets is once a week instead of twice.



The Building

This is a third floor walk up above a shop and a family that have been in their apartment for 30 years. It's on the funky side - not all the angles are 90 degrees, and the neighbors keep stuff on their landing, including a dusty ceramic swan. It's on a small (one-lane, one-way) commercial (busy) street (so traffic noise) and near a middle school (kid noise). Total noise insulation between us and the second floor neighbors, and no shared walls, but some street noise. The landlord is responsive and a nice guy, but I largely DIY. The family downstairs is always home, so while there is no door man or package room, delivery people always ring both bells and someone always answers the door to receive packages.



The Apartment

Technically a 3 bed, 1 bath, my bedroom is in the back and your bedroom and a room I use as an office are in the front, separated by a large living room with plants, a table and chairs, couch and TV.

The kitchen has a new fridge, a gas stove, microwave, convection oven, toaster, pots and pans and gadgets and gizmos. No dishwasher.

Bathroom has tub with shower, fancy Toto bidet seat, skylight.

The laundry situation is laundromats/drop off wash & fold, and a 3rd-world washing machine good for delicates or emergencies and portable dryer.

Hardwood floors, Verizon Fios wifi, window unit ACs, and steam radiators but with in-unit thermostat. An astounding 4 different vacuum cleaners. There is compost, trash, and 2 recycling bins, in accordance with local law and custom.



The Room

The room is medium sized, approximately 10.5’ x 11.5’, faces the street, and is furnished with a full sized bed (high enough for storage, including suitcases, underneath), bookshelf, desk/chair/lamp, clothes rack, dresser, large full length mirror, window AC when seasonally appropriate, small fan, insulated window shade that can be light filtering or blackout (although not 100% but pretty darn dim). The landscapes on the walls are from the Severance Season 2 set dec sale.



About You

The one thing I feel strongly about: You should please pee sitting down regardless of your physiology and close the lid before you flush the toilet. Please clean up after yourself promptly. Please communicate openly without defensiveness or passive aggression. I prefer that people aren't over a lot - kindly disclose if you have a romantic partner. An older person would probably be best (30+), but I'm open to younger people with older souls. The rent should be manageable for you, and not a stretch or big lift.



About This Lister

I am a single, middle-aged, white, queer, omniverous, cis female leftist, but I'm not that serious about it. I don't date or have people over. I work in TV production, and often work from home depending on the job I'm on. I wake up at 6:30 and go to bed at 10. I like going to the theater, I listen to NPR. I have a therapist. I ought to eat more at home. I clean the hair out of the drain every time and do dishes promptly. I hate dust and hair, but it's a struggle, hence the vacuums.

The dog is a 5 1/2 year old 13 pound long haired dachshund named Tiny Man. He's very fearsome and a mighty hunter, but he also wears a bowtie and sleeps a lot. He gets riled up and barks about twice a day (around 10am and 6pm) or if there is a percieved security threat (there has never been an actual security threat). He does have a really big bark for such a tiny guy. He's fascinated by the subway, which he's convinced is somehow actually under the street. He might be a little uncertain about you at first, but comes around pretty quick and wants to sit on the couch with you if you're wiling. I take him to work with me when I do go in. He doesn't like to be left alone, and I put out a pee pad for him if no one is going to be home. So we want to be transparent about all that.



Lister's Relationship to the Space

I am the current tenant



Rental requirements

Tell me about yourself and your plans - are you moving to the city and need a place to land while your look for a place, are you in town for work, do you need to live somewhere while you are renovating your apartment, etc. How long do you anticipate staying.

Please provide some documentation of your financial situation and personal references from roommates or landlord or similar.

A $500 deposit, and $1550 rent/utilities/incidentals are required up front, due on the 1st of the month, and payable by cash or Zelle.

Happy to show you the room in person, or FaceTime/Zoom. I'm currently pretty flexible.



Pets Policy

If you have a dog that we can meet in person in advance, and they're compatible with my dog, I would be open to that. A fish or a bird or a rodent would be ok. But no cats, my dog would go nuts and it would be stressful for everyone.

We spent a week in Galway, staying with my parents and aunt at a rental in the Claddagh. The house was incredible. Here are some curated photos of our trip if anyone is interested: https://imgur.com/a/FpmrutU

During our stay, we explored Galway and went on a few tours:

* Ferry tour of the Aran Islands / Inishmore / Cliffs of Moher
* “Castles of Connemara” tour, stopping at Kylemore Abbey and Aughnanure Castle

As foodies, we were thrilled with Galway’s dining scene! Everything we had was delicious, though some places felt overrated. Highlights included:

* Dela – so good we went twice; Granola bowl was class
* Ard Bia
* King’s Head – had the freshest, most delicious Guinness I’ve ever had
* Kai – felt a little overhyped
* Cava Bodega – similar to Kai
* Coffeework + Press – good iced Americano
* Urban Grind – the Oatmeal Bowl was incredible
* Dough Bros
* Plámás – tried my best and ordered in Irish; got an “A+” from the barista. Best coffee I had in Galway
* Il Vicolo – a highlight
* Rouge
* Pascal Coffee & Pancake House – some of the best pancakes I’ve ever had, and I live in the Southeastern US
* Tigh Nora’s – wonderful Gin and Tonics; Micil is pretty good gin, IMO

**Cong**

While in the area, we ventured out to Cong. We had lunch at McHughs and coffee at Puddleducks.

The real highlight of Cong was Afternoon Tea at Ashford Castle. It was our first time having afternoon tea in that type of setting, and it was a wonderfully relaxing experience. Walking around the grounds afterward was necessary, as we were quite full. While wandering, we encountered two falconers with a guest. One of the falcons was perched in a tree and dove right above my head to land on a bench behind me — happy I got it on film!

**Connemara**

On our way through Connemara, we stopped at Guy’s Seafood Bar in Clifton. Highly recommended — the Seafood Chowder was wonderful!

I could wax on and on about our trip. Our vacation and visit were truly grand. You live in a beautiful country with wonderful people! Happy to answer any questions about our visit! Go raibh maith agat, a Ghaillimh.",39,1758314242.0,galway,3,0.95,False

1nleqrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/1nleqrz/tourist_guide_to_tromsø/,Tourist guide to Tromsø,"Hei, as we say up here.

I’ve moved down to Oslo after living in Tromsø all my life and the last christmas trip up home was kind of scary because of all the tourists. 
Therefore i’ve decided that i’d give a pointer or two to whomever decides to live their dream-christmas in the snowy northern city. This is for tourists that don’t want to add to an already aggrevating state of constant tourism with frustrating people crowding our city.



#1: 
Please don’t book AirBnB, it’s a bad company that makes the lives of locals much harder than it needs to be. If you do, however, please respect your neighbours and hosts. Keep any parties quiet and don’t break shit. It’s not fun.

#2: 
Be prepared to se neither northern lights nor whales, cause both of them show up whenever the fuck they feel like it. Your time is probably best spent elsewhere. 

#3: 
Don’t huddle up in groups when you’re in town, especially in the town square. It’s impossible to go on a stroll back home when i have to push through an ocean of tourists that don’t know where to go and end up clotting up the sidewalk. Norwegians generally prefer a more effective way of sightseeing. 

#4:
We’d love it if you supported local businesses instead of going for the cheapest option. If we have to deal with a billion extra people then it’d be nice to have some economic upside to it. Check out Blårock Bar, Ølhallen, and Teatercaféen for drinks! Or go to Café Sånn, Rakettkiosken, and Burgr for a coffee/snack! 

#5:
Lastly, please don’t get too loud. We’ll be friendly after a drink or two, but don’t mistake that for everyone inviting for shouting. It’s a deeply rootes thing in Norwegian culture to be quiet in public, and it’s not a big ask to respect it when you can.


If you do go, enjoy yourselves. And please clean up after yourselves 👏🏼

Syringes:

Glue:

https://a.co/d/3sowhMK

Use a box cutter to slice off the tip near the base of the bottle lid, and slice off the tip of the syringe, leaving the “shoulders” for a surface to glue. When slicing the lid, don’t cut the very bottom where the spout meets the lid. Go a bit above and when you insert the syringe, the plastic on the lid will give a little bit, forming a nice grip around the syringe. 

Apply glue to the “shoulders” of the snipped syringe, and push through the bottom of the lid. I apply more E6000 above and below to form a flexible but strong watertight seal.

This method is strong enough to where you will be able to push you needle it into your project without fear. I use the tips all the time to push and pull fabric to get the dye deep in there. 

The bottles mouths are large so you can put in your water and dye powder. I use a coffee frother to mix the dye with a short 5 second burst. I can mix a dozen colors in about 10 minutes easily. No funnels, no rinsing, no mess.

I hope this helps save some frustration for some of you. It took me a bit to get here, I went through several bottle types and prototypes that checked all the boxes for me. ",16,1758314092.0,tiedye,2,1.0,False

VIP was stellar as usual, hearing Ladybug, Body Image and Day Trip was a great choice for the preshow (and in VIP I have the room to dance so I get to fully move around to their music without hitting people lol). Lots of questions that had good answers, like “when is the TWRP movie coming out?” Meouch: “what the fuck are you talking about lol.” My question “what food did you use for the sound affects in The Nourishing Act?” Which was answered by Sung for “an apple being sliced, classic eggs over easy for the sizzle and just a cup of coffee to drink for the sipping sound! A healthy yummy breakfast for a yummy song. Good question!” Someone asked Phobos about his Hatsune Miku pedal which he said he wants to use more in future songs, and alas my boyfriend’s question for Meowch on where he hides his tail was not answered. VIP started about 10 minutes late so a handful of Q’s were left in the box 🥺. We also had a mini zonal ascension from an anonymous person, though only a 1/3 of the crowd knew what was happening lol. 
After getting merch at the top of VIP (the puppet shirt I wanted didn’t have my size/only had smalls, but everything else was in stock) I was the first to ask about the VHS and was the one who claimed it for the night! Hearing Josh (the one managing the whole VHS process, he’s dressed as a pirate during the show) talk about the process of how he sets it up was such a delight, he really is passionate about the whole process. This VHS is worth the high price!!! With the VHS came a set list, which I’ve never had the chance at getting. Also!!! I am not allowed to post any recordings of the VHS (as it’s one of a kind/special that the band requested), so here is just one pic I took of Josh finishing up the editing after the show.

The concert itself was a dream come true; Super nice people all around us, I had the best view ever of all the times I’ve seen TWRP, and hearing The Longest Weekend live truly changed my life to where I might get some of the lyrics tattooed on my arm lol. Part way through the show I put my phone away and just lived in the moment, which was a fantastic decision because I made eye contact more with the band (and who wouldn’t when I had a bright pink sparkly wig on lol). Got some great photos of the boys, my top two is Sung relaxing in his camping chair and Sung “praying” (clapping) to Lord Phobos with some glorious lighting behind them. I will hopefully be editing more of my videos together from the show, as well as a fun “first time I saw them in 2019 vs this time in 2025” with All Night Forever. I have footage from a bunch of the first half of the set though, and TWRP did repost one of the clips on their Instagram story for an example. 
Thank you again to everyone that gave me bracelets, keychains, and just said hi/complimented my cosplay! Super grateful to feel comfortable and safe to wear the full get up. TWRP means everything to me, and I’m so happy to be apart of this great community. 🥹 ❤️🌭🐊💫",18,1758313927.0,TWRP,4,1.0,False

A coworker asked “ are you two coming to lunch?” Referring to myself and my husband who was not in the room. I replied that yes we were and she was excited and stated “ oh nice!

AND then at this moment my husbands co worker responded “ yeah I have to go feed my dog every day”… and then when I didn’t respond he mentioned “there was a joke in there”
I felt unsure of what the joke was, but I am a woman and I know that the term b!tch is a term for female dogs.

I slumped there staring at the newspaper. The wood-paneled cabinet across from me was stuffed to bursting with all sorts of dying plants and god knows what other poison. Well, the bottles, of course, the bottles I was trying hard not to think about. All I could do was try focusing on the paper, but it was no use. That infernal din coming from the kitchen just wouldn't stop, this endless stream of chatter from Lisa and Maria.

I tried to tune it all out, only picking up fragments of what they were blabbering about: ""Rafu"" this, ""builder extraordinaire"" that...

Then Maria's voice cut through like a jagged blade: ""Lisa, you're such a lucky woman to have a husband like Rafu slaving away for you. What a top bloke!"" Lisa's voice joined in, her words dripping with smug satisfaction as she proclaimed, ""Oh yes, Rafu single-handedly constructed our entire gaff... impressive, isn't it?""

Puke. I winced, the weight of their smirking admiration hitting me like a punch to the face. Oh please, what an utter pile of bollocks. The guy probably paid someone else to do it and was lying about the whole thing.

Then Maria had to be an absolute snake with her backhanded remark, ""I wish all men were like your Rafu."" That jab landed right in my solar plexus. I hated DIY projects and the idea of building anything around the house made me cringe.

""Fuck this!"" I snarled under my breath. Couldn't take it anymore. The heat of humiliation burned at my neck as I stormed out into the evening air, stomping down the street to that shitehole cafe where I could drown out my own worthlessness in coffee and crap news stories.

A week later, when I dragged my carcass back from yet another thankless day of wage slavery, Maria stood before me looking like a specter.

""What's the problem?"" I asked. She started weeping.

""Rafu! He...he got caught...erm ...playing with their neighbour's sheep!"" she cried out through snot and mascara-streaked tears. 

Oh what the actual fuck? 

I couldn't help but burst out laughing at the absurdity of it all. My laughter came on like a tsunami. Their fake happiness, their patronising stares at me, Lisa's pretentious DIY hero-worship. I pictured Lisa, her perfect face contorted in shock and disgust as she confronted her hypocrite of a husband who probably couldn't get it up for his wife but had no trouble getting down with livestock.

As I basked in the pure glee of seeing that pompous take a tumble. This is better than the morning's news about my horrible boss getting nicked for embezzling. Today's definitely my lucky day, a day of happiness. Finally!

Maria stopped weeping and glared at me, her eyes now filled with anger and disappointment. ""You're a horrible, spiteful person Dirk,"" she spat. ""You only get pleasure from seeing others miserable.""

""Not just any others,"" I corrected her, still chuckling ""Yes, it gives me great satisfaction to see insufferable people get their comeuppance.""

""I cannot believe you find this amusing!"" she spits. ""You're as nasty an bitter as they come!"" and she stormed out like the wounded shrike she was.

Ah yes...the gods of irony were smiling down upon me alright. 

I needed something class to match the feel-good vibe hanging in the air. So I raided the cabinet for the top shelf stuff. A 2015 Château Greysac. That particular moment was something else, one that deserved better than cheap plonk. The cork popped, wine poured into my glass with a satisfying glug, the liquid velvet caressing my tongue.

Elena has not returned from Skopje yet. It’s been a month since I’ve been waiting to tell her about my events and I expected to do so this weekend but she will be away for several more days. I will have to write to her instead. I will call her a colleague to annoy her. She will forget about it when she reads to the end.

*Hi Colleague,*

*I think I told you about my temporary work at the Ministry this summer. The Ministry was involved in a project and my tasks were related to that project. Actually, there were not many tasks. Most of the time I did not work on anything. There were some database tasks that took me ten days at most. I taught the minister to check his email, I tried to explain that he should not use the Enter key to get to the new line and occasionally I intervened when his Solitaire icon got lost. Additionally, I installed a LAN, set up a few printers and I did a couple other trivial things there. Ministry employees saw it as turning water to wine. They quite liked me at that work place.*

*Anyway, nothing interesting happened there. What I want to tell you happened outside the Ministry building, during the project activities. You may think that this is one of my imaginary love stories that have made you smile since 2001 but this is not that case.*

*In July we had a workshop in Volos. The participants were the IT administrators from the various European Ministries. We were trained to operate the project database. Every country enters their data in order to centrally monitor the data relevant to the project. The training lasted for ten days and it was boring, but that is where I met a girl, Aliki. We had a great time, I will not talk about the details, “don’t kiss and tell.”*

*When I got back to Banja Luka, I was fully aware of how good I felt in Volos. Then I started to figure out how to go to Volos again. I had all kinds of ideas, but none of them worked. I had to show up to work every day. This was my first official employment. My parents would think that I wasn’t serious if I left it after one month. Volos is far away, I can’t go there within one weekend. I need at least ten days off, plus I need a Greek visa.*

*During my attempts to get to Volos somehow, I heard that there will be another conference within this project in Volos. I had no option but to beg the minister to include me in his entourage. I thought I had a chance because he was happy with my contribution in the Ministry. I scheduled a meeting with the minister and I said in plain words that I was already in Volos, I met a girl there and I had been thinking how to get back to Volos since I returned. It was quite hard to do so and it would mean so much to me if he could somehow bring me with him there. I knew he was not going alone there. He replied that this was a ministerial-level conference, that a two-member delegation had already been designated, and that he couldn’t help me in any way. I tried suggesting a few other options, but nothing worked. In the end, clutching at straws, I said that Aliki has a lovely aunt, still single and beautiful, and that maybe we could all go out and have a good time together.*

*“What aunt, David? No way. I told you, we don’t have the capacity now. If there’s another seminar for technical personnel, we’ll send you.”*

*I left the minister’s office sad, but I didn’t stop plotting ways to get to Volos as soon as possible. Finally, I decided to work through July and August, quit in September, and head to Volos. Aliki could find me a place to rent for a month, and I’d return to Novi Sad in October when lectures resumed. I calmed myself down and waited for September.*

*However, a few days after my request, my phone rang, and the minister said:*

*“David, does this aunt of hers really exist, or are you joking?”*  
*“She does, Minister, of course, she does.”*

*It turned out that his party friend had canceled, leaving an open spot, so he and I could both go to Volos. I called Aliki and told her that the minister had promised to take me but that she needed to find a woman to pretend to be the aunt, go out for a drink or dinner once, and then she could reject him afterward. It wasn’t our fault if he didn’t appeal to her.*

*She said she had a neighbor, perfect for the role, and that she’d probably enjoy the game—and might even find him appealing, considering his position. Everything fell perfectly into place, and on September 3rd, the minister and I arrived in Volos, a day before the conference began. That evening, we went out to a restaurant on a hill above the city, on the road to Makrinitsa.*

*The minister met Stella, Aliki’s neighbor. They conversed in their broken, basic Russian, a language they both learned in school. The view of the city and sea was fantastic. I thought how lovely it would be if the minister and his new friend weren’t there. Still, my plan was to have one drink with them and then head out alone with Aliki.*

*Aliki suggested we drink wine in a garden on the other side of the bay, saying I’d love it. Meanwhile, the minister kept ordering drinks, seemingly running out of courage. The more alcohol flowed, the smoother their Russian became, and the atmosphere grew livelier. Stella patted the minister’s shoulder and said:*

*“мой брат сербский, мой министр.*[*^(1)*](https://nolifers.club/alikis-aunt/#sdfootnote1sym)*”*

*The minister didn’t mind the familiarity of “Aunt Stella,” despite being Bosniak by ethnicity. He demonstrated a broad-mindedness and national tolerance, probably what earned him such a responsible position. What else could it be?*

*While it was amusing, Aliki and I left for the garden at Nees Pagases. It was perfect—just meters from the sea. I could have spent the entire night there. We stayed even after the waiters went home. I lost track of time, forgetting I was in Volos, forgetting about the conference starting the next morning.*

*When I checked my phone, it was past two a.m. We called a taxi to return to the city. I dropped Aliki off and went to pick up the minister and his companion.*

*The restaurant was closing. Where we had sat earlier was now empty. The only guests were in an open booth. Inside, Stella was drunk, with two quite intoxicated tourists pawing at her—a nasty scene. I got worried about the minister, who had been tipsy before I left and was now unaccounted for after five hours. I asked a waitress where the gentleman sitting with the lady in the booth was. She pointed toward the restroom.*

*Inside, there were traces of blood, and one stall was completely bloody. My fear grew. I was alone on this trip with the minister, who was of a different ethnicity, anything could be speculated. I passed the stalls and found him near the sinks. Alive, moving, but barely standing. He had drunk too much and vomited blood. No one had hurt him. I was relief.*

*The taxi waited outside, and we left for the hotel. Stella decided to stay behind.*

*We arrived at the hotel before four a.m. The minister was in bad shape. I left him to sleep, told him to call me if he needed anything, and promised to wake him at seven a.m. for the conference. Before falling asleep, he thanked me for my efforts and praised my work in much the same way he had when I installed a printer in his office.*

*I dozed off in the hotel lobby. The alarm woke me ten minutes before seven. I woke up the minister, and we started with a coffee. The man turned three shades of pale within a minute and rushed to the bathroom to throw up. He was in a miserable state, clearly suffering from a terrible hangover. Then he said to me:*

“*David, go to the conference instead of me today. I can’t make it. I’ll take over tomorrow.”*  
*“But how can I? I’m just the network administrator.”*  
*“Sit there so the chair isn’t empty. Listen to what’s happening so you can report back to me, and don’t participate in the discussion.”*

*The minister’s idea was absurd, probably something that would never have crossed his mind in a normal mental state. On the other hand, I felt indebted to this man for bringing me to Volos, where I was clearly going to have a great time. I also felt a bit guilty for not picking him up earlier last night. After some weak resistance, I agreed to sit in for him at the conference today.*

*I quickly got dressed, showered, and headed to the conference room. I thought, I’ll just sit through this today, and then I’ll be free again. Aliki had mentioned a theater performance earlier, so I had packed semi-formal clothes: sneakers that could pass for shoes, a shirt that was barely acceptable, and two pairs of jeans. I chose the darker pair to appear somewhat more serious. It wasn’t ideal, but there is no other option.*

*I entered the room and immediately caught some looks. Young and casual amid a sea of suits and ties. I spotted the Bosnian flag and sat down quickly to minimize attention to my jeans.*

*The conference began—introductory ceremonies, speeches by the organizers and special guests. Then the moderator took over, announced the program, and gave the floor to a lady presenting some report with a presentation that had almost zero contrast between background and text. I got bored and started fiddling with the headphones and buttons for the simultaneous translation. There were only two options—English and Russian. I switched to Russian because the interpreter’s pleasant female voice was more engaging, though I barely understood anything. I wanted to turn around and see what she looked like but decided against drawing attention. Sit still, David, and just look straight ahead.*

*I feared the monotonous language might lull me to sleep, so I switched back to English—just in time. The moderator announced that each participating country would now share their progress in implementing the Emen project. I had no idea what Emen was—I thought it was some organization funding this project. Later, I realized it was a town in the Netherlands. If I’d ever played the Dutch league on Championship Manager, I might have had an easier time.*

*My brain started racing—what could I possibly say when it was my turn? After a few minutes, I calmed down. I’ll just listen to what others say and throw together some vague sentences that resemble theirs. After all, I’m only here to fill two minutes of the program. But my plan was thwarted when the moderator announced the order: alphabetical. Only one country was before Bosnia and Herzegovina.*

*Why wasn’t the Federation’s Ministry participating in this conference? That thought struck me for the first time.*

*Throughout the conference, there was some murmuring, whispering, and chatter. But when it was my turn, an absolute silence fell over the room. Everyone seemed eager to hear who I was and what I had to say. I felt every gaze on me, leaned into the microphone, and said:*

*“I must admit that our country hasn’t made significant progress in implementing the Emen project. We are here to learn from the experiences of more developed nations and apply them back home. The minister will attend the conference starting tomorrow and contribute to the discussions. Today, he was unable to come due to illness. Our Ministry places great emphasis on this project, and the minister has high expectations for this conference.”*

*I added a few more similar sentences, though I can’t recall them now. Everyone stayed silent while I spoke, except for the Croatian delegate, who couldn’t contain his laughter. I figured he knew my minister and found it hilarious that someone like me was speaking on his behalf.*

*All the participants reported on their progress, and shortly after ten, the moderator announced a break. I decided to step out and not return. This morning’s decision was a mistake, a product of strange circumstances—mostly alcohol and sleep deprivation.*

*On my way out, I was intercepted by the Croatian and Slovenian ministers, who were laughing as they asked who I was. I began explaining that I worked in the Ministry, handled computer systems, and was only here because the minister was sick.*

“*That’s all fine, but during your short speech, you said “fuck” twice.”*

*Then I started laughing with them. Apparently, while crafting sentences and translating on the fly, I’d slipped in two curses that only the neighboring delegates understood. They knew my language.*

*Finally, I headed for the door, convinced this surreal episode was over. As soon as I exited the hall, I was stopped by a lady who introduced herself as the project’s creator. Clearly, I had caught her attention too.*

“*You’re so young and already a minister.”*

*I explained I wasn’t a minister, that the minister was sick, and that I was just an IT specialist managing databases. She responded enthusiastically:*

“*Wonderful! Our project desperately needs people with IT expertise.”*

*Some lights went on in my head. Maybe I could land a job in a project funded by a European organization. These crazy situations can lead to such outcomes. I imagined they’d pay better than the Ministry. I told her I found the project interesting and could allocate time to work on it, which would help fund my ongoing studies. She laughed, seemingly amused. I thought it was because I admitted I hadn’t even finished university, while she had mistaken me for a minister.*

*Finally, she said:*

“*But surely you know… this is a volunteer project. Everyone working on it is a volunteer.”*

*That’s when I started backpedaling, determined to avoid unpaid work. Somehow, I managed to extricate myself. I stepped outside, took a deep breath, and returned to the hotel.*

Email From Elena:

*David,*

*First of all, let me explain: Don’t kiss and tell means you shouldn’t mention the girl at all, not just leave out the details.*  
*I can already picture your face as you first mentioned the “aunt” to the minister, and I can hear exactly how you’d say it.*

*You see, unlike you, I’ve been busy working all summer. You claimed to be working there, but I can only imagine what that looks like—probably just you having fun in Greece on the state’s dime.*  
*Speaking of my summer experience, did you know you can create an email signature that automatically adds itself to the bottom of every email you send?*  
*Oh, who am I kidding—you obviously didn’t know that. You never know anything, and it’s always me who has to teach and show you stuff.*

*It’s not that I mind typing out “Best regards, Elena” at the end of an email, but I was working for this jerk of a boss, and it was just so hard to write something nice at the end of my emails. Sure, everyone knows it’s just a formality, but I couldn’t stomach ending with Best regards when I didn’t mean anything nice and his emails made me nauseous. Every time I saw an email from him, my face would immediately fall.*

*Then I discovered this option to automate it, so it adds itself—I don’t have to type it. Do you know what kind of guy he is? He overloads you with work, and when you somehow manage to pull through, he says, “You are doing a great job.”*

*You know, there are two kinds of “You are doing a great job.” One comes from a normal person who’s genuinely satisfied, and the other comes from someone manipulative who’s observed how normal people talk, assumes it’s motivational, and uses it to squeeze 20 more lines of code out of you for the same pay.*

*And then he tells me I don’t pay attention to detail. I guess that’s what people say now when they have no real critique to offer.*

*Best regards,*  
*Elena*

That boss really does sound like a jerk. Elena always paid attention to every detail—functional and aesthetic—in everything we worked on, whether it was software or anything else. She aligned, adjusted, rephrased, and refined until her standards were met. How many times had we shifted something, rewritten it, or tried it again and again to meet her exacting criteria?

My reply:

*Hmm… so it’s an innovation… you don’t write it, but it’s still there… you didn’t do it, yet it’s done… you don’t mean it, but it’s still there… so you’re not even being insincere… hmm… we should explore other areas of life where we can apply this concept.*

From Elena:

*I could barely brush my teeth. Every time I think of you mentioning “the aunt” to the minister, I burst out laughing and lose control of the toothbrush.*

*Best regards,*  
*Elena*

My reply:

*Dear Colleague,*

*I’ve implemented the signature. Thank you for the suggestion.*

*I’ve also been having random fits of laughter lately. My uncle told me a joke they used to tell before football matches when he was training. I can’t stop laughing about it, even while walking down the street.*

*Best regards,*  
*David*

Elena sent several emails, insisting I tell her the joke, but all I could say was that it wasn’t for her ears because she’s a little girl.",2,1758313679.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I started medication right away to boost productivity, but after 8 months I realized it wasn’t good for me long-term, so I stopped. Instead, I leaned on coffee and working out of coffee shops to stay focused and productive.

That worked for a while, but about a year later I suddenly became super sensitive to caffeine. Now if I drink coffee, I can’t sleep for 12–13 hours, which is wrecking my sleep quality and REM cycle.

I went to a psychiatrist today and told him I don’t want to go back on meds, I just wanted to understand why this sensitivity happened and how I can stay productive without caffeine. Unfortunately, he kept pushing medication and didn’t give me much else.

So I’m turning to you all: has anyone here dealt with something similar? How did you manage your productivity without coffee (and ideally, while keeping sleep intact)?

This book goes into more depth than teaching you how to order a coffee or catch a train. You will develop an understanding of how the language functions. But the tone is rather casual. It is not like your typical, dry, academic textbook.

Instead, the language is taught through stories, including an American surfer who moves to Porto and meets a local girl. The chapter on numbers involves them going to an escape room. In order to get out, they need to know the dates of important events in Portuguese history.

**WRITER’S BLOOD (iron-tinged blood, a manuscript soaked in spilled black coffee, and an overturned tin of rolling tobacco.)** In the vial: POTENT. Black coffee, but a very rich and earthy take on it, almost cacao-like, like you’re smelling the grounds. I think the metallic edge of the blood is helping with this impression. I can’t quite describe Alkemia’s paper scent but it is there, it’s not vanillic or anything, just smells a bit… old? And finally, the tobacco is not smoky, barely spicy, it’s just contributing to the earthiness. On the skin: the coffee is much more subdued, I can actually smell the blood and tobacco as main notes rather than the backdrop. “Spilled coffee on paper” is a good description - this does NOT smell like a gourmand cup of coffee, it’s spilled coffee on a desk. It’s almost bitter, oxidized, stale type of coffee. It’s very, very metallic - not Alkemia’s bizarre rubber/grey amber note that they use in Deus ex Machina, Industrial Sabotage or The White Rose (although I do get a faint whiff of burned rubber), it’s a very... visceral smell. People say this smells a lot like ink but if it does, it’s a completely different smell from The Raven. This dries into a metallic and sweet tobacco scent with hints of bitter, oxidized coffee. It’s somehow “sterile”. It’s very interesting and has a lot of personality but I find it a bit headache inducing. It also lasts forever! Cool scent, and I enjoy it in a way, but I can’t see myself ever reaching for it so **4/10**. 

**EXPERIMENT 3 AKA PIPE DREAMS (A reverie of smouldering pipe tobacco, affogato al caffè, a splash of amaretto, and frankincense.)** In the vial: this is veryyy amaretto, I get almost nothing else except maybe a hint of vanilla. On the skin: whoof! Still, a punch of amaretto, not a splash! After that, a very similar tobacco to Writer’s Blood, sweet and earthy.. The amaretto calms down considerably as the oil absorbs into the skin, but it's still the dominant note. I don’t get a deep rich coffee, maybe faint hints of coffee grounds with a bit of vanilla essence as it dries. It seems mostly a sweet tobacco scent with sweet, syrupy amaretto backed by the coffee. The frankincense must be very faint and blending with the others. I was expecting more affogato from this so I’m a bit disappointed, but again, I do enjoy this sweet tobacco smell. **6/10**, not what I expected and I’m not in love with it but it’s a pleasant tobacco with anise, I’d rather smell like this than Writer’s Blood.

**OF BRONZE AND BLAZE (Autumnal bronze amber aged with cognac barrel staves, red oak leaves, Perique pipe tobacco, raw wool, ripe pumpkin, opoponax (sweet myrrh), and soft suede gloves warmed by a creamy steamy cup of Bourbon vanilla coffee.)** In the vial: it's quite faint, but I get a lot of vanilla essence. On the skin: hmm, that's still quite measured. It's well blended. I get a bit of a metallic pang, it actually makes me think of pu-erh tea. There is a very creamy sort of vanilla with only the tiniest bit of a very gourmand coffee. This is a powdery, cozy gourmand (without lactonic notes), the myrrh and wool are very pretty together and make this feel very warm. Leather isn't very present, tobacco a bit more so. Alkemia I feel has a lot of these cozy vanilla and cashmere/wool scents but this one is a bit special, the metallic tang is really unusual. As it dries I feel it goes a bit less sweet, still retains a bit of that “hot cup of a creamy drink” vibe. Essentially this is a very skin-like version of their usual cozy vanillas, it turns into a soft, slightly spiced myrrh with some clean wool, boozy vanilla, and a metallic edge. It's also the most unisex of this family, it's a bit like being inside a cozy café. The scent is quite pretty but I can't give it more than a **8/10** because it's very very soft.

**ACADEMY OF PLEASURE (red and golden ambers infused with a bottle of fine cognac liqueur, a suede waistcoat hurriedly abandoned on an antique chair, a haphazard tangle of bergamot scented linen sheets, cardamon-hashish coffee, and a cedar lined cigar humidor.)** In the vial: there is something shockingly cologney about this, which I would not have guessed from the notes! Too much of an alcohol note perhaps? On the skin: still smells a lot of a woodsy, Bay Rum-y men’s cologne/aftershave. I think it's partly also the bergamot that's just way too citrusy. As it's drying I realize - it's not only cologne, it's LAUNDRY! Wayy too much linen! Maybe a tiny bit of cardamom comes out as it dries, but I get almost nothing else than aquatic, asteringent, masc Laundry. How disappointing, I was looking forward to these notes! **3/10**

**CAVEAU DES INNOCENTS (tabac, dark coffee, piquant cloves, rum soaked pears, candied citron, dark caramel, and star anise bathed in intoxicating swirls of opoponax, labdanum, hashish, benzoin resinoid, vanilla incense, and guaiac wood.)** In the vial: very heady resin (benzoin?) with a helping of vanilla and booze. On the skin: surprisingly goes faint upon application, I get tobacco, a hint of citron (it’s not overly tart, moreso dry), and a powdery, resinous wood. The booze notes are very sweet and vanillic, it reminds me of making buttered rum with vanilla essence. The tobacco is stronger than the coffee, this reads like a masc gourmand, in a way, The coffee note is tiny. This blooms beautifully on the skin, I start perceiving the rum pears (a bit overly syrupy, just a slightly fruity booze note) and the cloves. Overall I’d describe this as a spicy amber with tobacco, and a base of vanilla and dusty wood that wears quite close to the skin (and dries down to mostly tobacco). If you're looking for a typical indie sweet amber autumn fragrance, but a more unisex/masc version of it (so avoiding overly vanillay/marshmallowy/etc notes, leaning more on the tobacco, booze and spices), and which wears quite close to the skin, I think this is a very pleasant, intimate one. Probably won't purchase because there are versions of this scent profile I enjoy more but **7/10**

**CLUB DES HASHISCHINS (hashish coffee and dawamesk from an original 1844 Club des Hashischins recipe that includes orange peel, cinnamon, clove, cardamon, nutmeg, and kola nuts blended with African Bronze Honey, blackberry pipe tobacco, leathered labdanum. )** In the vial: the first real coffee since Writer’s Blood! Very yummy, there is also something quite astringent, as if this should contain an alcohol note. On the skin: very much coffee. Still something almost alcoholic about it. The spices remind me a bit of mulled wine, and whatever honey may be there does not make this very sweet, but it does have a bit of a “sugared coffee” sweetness that nonetheless does not bother me because it brings out the tobacco nicely. The resin isn’t overpoweringly headachey here - I think the coffee isn’t strong enough to make this “edible” and the labdanum isn’t strong enough to make this “perfumey”, this fragrance smells like… being inside of a speakeasy where they are burning incense. I think it’s quite well balanced in that way. It smells meditative. I hesitate to even call it a “traditionally masc” cologne, this makes me want to wear it while dressed in a masc ""dark academia"" type outfit. I will say, the one point against it is that the blackberry becomes very loud at one point - may be the source of the almost alcoholic astringency? The spices are really well done, too, this doesn’t smell like a Christmas candle, just… actually spicy. Very good, a tentative **10/10** but I’d have to wear all over to see if I want to FS it. Fantastic if you’re looking for a non-gourmand coffee. Decently strong for Alkemia, too. Fades into a sort of tobacco-and-labanum base.

**SIGIL (olibanum frankincense, lignum aloes, bdellium, styrax, black honey, euphorbium, opium thebaicum, dried citrus, and the quintessence of gold; and an alchemist's compounding of coffee beans and ritual herbs.)** One of my first Alkemia, from like a year ago!  In the vial: smells a bit fresher and more citrusy than the others. On the skin. Ahhh, I’ve smelled this in several Alkemias. I think that’s just a shitton of frankincense? Something incensey but in a very powdery way. But with citrus. It doesn’t open with a lot of coffee or oud, only a touch of honey. It’s… oddly aldehydic? Almost fizzy. Bizarre, wouldn’t expect it from the notes, but it makes it borderline soapy. The opium (which smells quite nice) does come out as it dries and makes this a bit creamier, but it’s still strangely fizzy. If I’m being generous I would call it balsamic. If you want a resin-based perfume that has a lot of… sparkling citrus…? To cheer it up, it’s not BAD, just really not what I look for in a frankincense, oud, honey and coffee fragrance. It actually reminds me a lot of some of their heavily resin-based “wintery” smells, but without the fir/pine, like Falling Stars on Winter Solstice (myrrh and resins) or Dust of Snow (resin and lemon). I don’t know what to make of it. It’s fine? Just unexpected. **4/10**, I wouldn’t hate to smell like it I guess.

**AS DARK THINGS ARE MEANT TO BE LOVED (REVISITED) (Lapsang souchong tea, aloeswood, smoked black amber, aged dark patchouli, tonka, Amazonian breuzinho, Moroccan bhakoor, labdanum, temple incense, caramelized opium, black coffee, black coconut, soft Russian leather, and tabac leaf.)** Revisited because this is one of my favorites and I see how it holds up to Club des Hashichins! In the vial: a much more gourmand coffee than CdH, there is something to it like a dark, dense cake. On the skin: it again opens with sort of an astringent, boozy note. Much more immediately smoky than CdH, not in a woodsmoke way, definitely gets across the lapsang souchong note. It's quite resinous and I think all the gourmand notes do a good job of pushing up these resin notes without making it an actual foody scent. The incense is (luckily) not nag champa, “temple incenses” usually mean more frankincense/myrrh. It's not an oud either, I think if anything it contributes a bit to the wood/smoke backdrop. This is a darrrrk vanilla amber, the coconut isn't tropical at all, rather caramelized and syrupy. It's not a subtle scent at all, basically all the notes listed come through one way or another, except maybe the leather. A lot of people describe this as cola and although it's not the case for me, I could see it - I wonder what note Alkemia uses that this keeps happening? My theory is one of their specific resins. Anyways, **9/10**, because the opening is 10/10 but compared to CdH (which retains some tobacco), and MdSeT (which stays strongly tobacco and honey throughout), this one does turn a bit more herbal and smoky as it dries (labdanum?).

**BOOK OF NIGHT (REVISITED) (A mysterious blend of artemisia, oakmoss, blue juniper berries, black patchouli, sweet pipe tobacco, clove, and ritual incense resins curled up with the bedtime coziness of cashmere blanket and a steaming chai tea.)** In the vial: much more herbal and fresh than previous ones, like berries and juniper. On the skin: very much oakmoss/juniper forward with a base of cashmere and light patchouli. There is a light spiciness from the chai, and a very light resinous base. It's an interesting take on herbal, fresh and borderline fir-y without really being capital g Green. A very light laundry touch. I don't get much tobacco at all, and this reads slightly more clean than mysterious, but it does have a bit of personality. Just sort of an understated, comfortable to wear oakmoss fragrance, but nothing special imo. **6/10**

**THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE DAMNED (honey caramel, dark cacao, French lavender, red currants, Madagascar vanilla, champagne aldehydes, sultry golden amber, cubeba pepper, blonde tobacco, dried rose leaves, opoponax, black copal, guaiacwood, copaiba balsam bathed in an elixir of sexually alluring animalics and pheromones.)** In the vial: Just sort of a sweet, powdery amber, maybe a tiny bit of rose. On the skin: something astringent and bitter about this amber. I’ve smelled this in other Alkemias before, I think maybe the guaiac wood or the balsam? Maybe the pheromones. There is maybe a hint of lavender and slightly funky animalics. It’s quite faint, and it reads soapy but not purposefully so, like these notes don’t quite blend together. I get essentially nothing of honey, caramel or cacao. Just sort of a powdery lavender and a bit of a funky amber. A boring **3/10.**

**MIEL DE SAUVAGE ET TABAC (Sweet, spicy pipe tobacco flecked with wild honey, beeswax, freshly crushed honeycomb, the pollen of forest blossoms, and smoked black amber.)** In the vial: what a way to wake my nose up after The Beautiful and the Damned!! Damn, that’s strong. Smoked honey, tobacco, exactly as promised. The smokiness almost leans meat, but I enjoy that. On the skin: it’s less in-your-face than I feared (or I went anosmic to it fast), but it’s good. The honey isn’t exceedingly sweet, it’s a proper beeswax smell, like a beeswax candle. The smoke is there but nowhere near BBQ level, the tobacco is well-mixed with the honey, fairly sweet while still giving this an edge. This is one of those scents I consider unisex not for being afraid and uncommitted but rather for going hard on both ends of the scale. Like many of Alkemia’s best, it’s very simple and straightforward. Can’t say I get any clear florals. **10/10,** pretty nice longevity while not choking you with its performance. A statement fragrance while still mantaining a sort of elegance. Glad I got this in the July sale.

**THE ROMANCE OF LUST (Randy dirt-sexy patchouli, black vanilla, salaciously sticky honeycomb, and a darkly concupiscent amber infused with botanical pheromones.)** In the vial: That's INTENSE. While MdSeT goes for a more “waxy” honey, this goes full on sticky, syrupy, and most of all - a very heavy, ambery patchouli, bordering on musky/animalic. On the skin: again, an almost dirty, earthy patchouli with a THICK honey note. It's almost creamy from the vanilla. As it dries you can start getting a bit of the patchouli’s herbal/medicinal edge. In comparison, I described Patchouli Amour as a very beginner-friendly, “clean” patchouli. I initially gave this a higher grade, but I'll knock it down to a **8/10** because while I would wear this on a date night to feel sexy, the drydown is a bit too patchouli and medicinal (a bit of that licorice or rubbing alcohol quality) and not enough honey - I feel MdSeT does it better, leans more on the honey, is more versatile and I prefer tobacco to patchouli. However this LASTS, possibly the longest out of any here except maybe Writer’s Blood. I applied it at 8AM and am still sniffing it on my wrist at 10PM.

This was a tricky one, with all that sky, and sea, and rock, but I got there in the end. There was good variety in piece shapes, and the middle part of the sky was probably the toughest section.

It's compact, for a 1500, easily fitting on my coffee table, which does mean the pieces are quite small. The fit was quite loose.

I didn't like the clamshell/pizza box, and actually used the box from my previous puzzle while I was working on it. And it's not really my kind of subject matter.

Parks for activities, parks for meeting, parks for gathering, parks for flowers, parks for trees, parks for exercise, parks, a subtle reminder of the cost of convenience, parks for mourning. I wish convenience held me tight, it will never be my home, radiators could never replace the burning glow of a wood stove warming cold floors, parks could never deafen the longing created miles from civilization, air conditioning could never cool the burning desire for a free fall into ice cold water, prim and proper perfectly watered flowers dull in comparison to an opening in the trees where spring blooms without humanity. The trimmed grass feeling aggressive like that of a buzz cut, the flat side walk, the cracked sidewalk, the brick, the handrails, the steps, the stoops, the signs, endless direction, the convenience. I have grown skinny in the abundance of diverse sustenance, eyes sore from sleeping through a starless night, posture fatigued from short walks, temperament rising in a climate controlled environment, silent sounds of sirens under stimulate, a desert could quench this thirst, a cold morning could warm my heart, endless convenience suffocates me.

I was cashing out a really friendly, but apparently oblivious lady earlier today. On the left side of my till, there's a tip cup. It's pretty clearly a tip cup, the fact that it's see through and full of change really gives it away. On the right side of the till is my reusable coffee cup and like 40% of it's coffee. Just a cheap plastic one, the ones that look like a regular Starbucks cup but it's plastic. They come with a lid but I didn't use it because I'm a.) weird and picky about lids, and b.) stupid.

So anyway we're chatting away and she dumps 75 cents into my coffee and I die inside. I thought about still drinking it, but couldn't bring myself to try. I'm not going to try to do the math to figure out if the coffee left in the cup was worth less than 75 cents but to me it was priceless.
