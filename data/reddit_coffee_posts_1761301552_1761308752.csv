Normal friendships that blends with my female friendships. We have group chats sending memes, ocassionally grab coffee or hang in group settings. 

But my boyfriend gets weirdly quiet whenever I mention them. When I ask if it bothers him, he says he trust me. But clearly something's up. 

I want to respect whatever he's feeling, but he won't actually tell me what that is. And I'm not cutting off friends based on a vibe. 

Genuinely asking men here, what do you guys need in this situation? Should I bring it up differently? Stop mentioning them? Or is this something he needs to work though himself?",1,1761308540.0,AskMenAdvice,3,1.0,False
1oew8mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1oew8mq/analyzed_25000_nyc_restaurants_bars_and_cafes_as/,"Analyzed 25,000 NYC restaurants, bars and cafes as a side project - built an app to find the actually unique ones","Google Maps kept showing me chains. Instagram influencers posted the same 10 trendy spots. I wanted to find the actually unique places - the tiny wine bar in Chinatown, the family-run Georgian restaurant, the speakeasy you'd walk past without knowing.

So I built Nectar while working full-time in finance. Analyzed 25,000+ places across NYC and filtered down to those that are genuinely ""one of one"" - experiential, not generic. The map evolves as new spots open and the food scene changes, so it stays current without being algorithm-driven viral nonsense.

The app maps them with filtering by vibe, neighborhood, cuisine - basically the discovery tool I wished existed. No ads, no data selling, just good spots.

Built with Flutter/Django/Supabase. Took way longer than expected (don't they all?), but finally launched on the App Store this week.

Free to download: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nectar-find-your-spot/id6753898421)

Would love feedback from fellow builders - especially on the onboarding and discoverability features.

3 weeks ago started adding fermented foods but did it differently this time:

week 1: just 1 tbsp of kefir daily (not a full cup)
week 2: added sauerkraut to lunch
week 3: kombucha with less than 5g sugar

results after about 2.5 weeks:
- bloating dropped like 80%
- don't need 3 coffees anymore
- sleeping better too??

the key was starting SMALL. first time i tried a full cup of kefir i was dying lol

also most store stuff is pasteurized = dead bacteria = waste of money

While I've been generally pleased with the quality of the coffee (importantly both pour over and espresso) something happened yesterday that I've been waiting to happen. While my partner was brewing coffee she looked me in the eyes and said, ""I hate this grinder."" 

We need to find something that's a bit more of a joy to use with a bit less faff involved while using it. Her specific annoyances are, probably obviously, stalling. The other big issue is capacity.

I knew I was making compromises when I purchased this grinder, I'd save some money and it'd be a bit finicky. Well, the time has come to put up or shut up. Where do we go from here? Everytime I think about upgrading any piece of gear I realize how many new things there are that I don't know about. Should we just get the Lagom P64 I was initially listing over?? 

For background here's our grinder upgrade path: Baratza Encore > [bought a lever machine] > Kinu M47 > [tired of hand grinding larger batches] > Niche Zero > [wanted a little more out of our cups, specifically flat burrs] > DF64V. 

Out of all of them, the DF64V is her least favorite, though she did struggle with hand grinding.

1oew4zd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oew4zd,Bought and customised my Alter/Ego bag at Coach @ Cat Street in Tokyo (and got Coach coffee!),"I was really lucky to visit Japan earlier this month. I love to buy a new bag whenever I visit somewhere new as a momentum of the trip, and I was so excited to find our the Coach store in Harajuku was a Coach Play store! 

I had no idea what to expect and I'd been to many Coach stores and outlets before this but never a Play store. The store itself stood out on the street it was on and when I got inside it was 3 floors! 

The top floor was a coffee shop so even if I didn't buy anything, I knew I'd be getting coffee! I loved the C art on the foam and the cookie was delicious! No one was in there so it was a very relaxed and lovely break from the street outside. 

The coffee shop had some great looking merch such as t-shirts, baseball caps and keyrings, but I chose to go without as they were all £50+.

I then went downstairs to look at bags. I'd been eyeing up the Swing Zip and the Alter/Ego but ultimately went with the Alter/Ego as the leather was so soft and I love the slouchy design and bigger size. I couldn't find this colour on the UK site so that finalised my decision. The bag was 57,000¥ (£280) which is only slightly cheaper then the £295 it was listed back home, but Japan offers tourists the 10% tax back so overall I'm very happy with the saving! 

Finally, it being a Coach Play store, they offered real-time customisation! For 2,000¥ (£10) I had a cherry charm added to one of the patches on my Alter/Ego. But I tell you it was painful to watch them drill a hole in the bag just after I'd bought it 😅

Overall, as a Coach girl this was such a fun experience! If you find yourself in Tokyo I'd definitely recommend popping in for a coffee. The staff were so lovely and welcoming, and there was also a stamp hunt throughout the store, and if you collect all 5 stamps you get to have a go on the Coach capsule toy machine.

1oew26g,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oew26g/feelings_for_an_ex/,Feelings for an ex,"I am so frustrated (24f)

My ex broke up with me 2 years ago. 2 YEARS AGO. This was my first relationship, not just with a girl but with anybody.

Due to us being in the same friend group, we have had to spend loads of time together before during and after the relationship. 

The only boundary was me not allowing our friends to bring her into my house when I´m there as I needed some sort of solace or break from seeing her. 

I´ve been with people since both romantically and sexually, both men and women. Maybe in the one night stands, I´ve been fine and forgotten all about her, sure, but in the romantic endeavours, it always comes back. 

My last relationship, I had to end after about 3 months because I was constantly comparing the feelings that I had for my ex to my new gf. I knew that I was more into my ex after a certain point and felt that I would just be dragging my new gf along until I no longer could. 

So I broke it off, ended it and I know it was the right thing to do because I wasn´t really upset about it. It was more like losing a coworker that got a new job than a relationship at the time unfortunately. 

  
Now fast forward to now. I have moved abroad for a year and my ex has also left the city we live for a year. 

Before we both leave, we have to both attend events for friends and one of these events ends with just us left in the taxi. I drunkenly spill my guts that I´ve compared every relationship both romantic and sexual to her and it´s never the same. She jokingly says ´you going to invite me in for a drink or something?´. I knew this was a BAD IDEA so I said ´No, text me when you´re up tomorrow and we should go for a coffee´

Next day, no text but now I´m flying off the handle because it´s all I can think about. What if I did bring her into the house last night? 

What if we go for coffee and find we still love eachother?

What if we get back together and then both of us have to move away for a year as both trips were secured in place? 

  
Instead we dont meet for a coffee and we exchange a few texts instead. 

She says ´I didnt mean it and I dont think it´s a good idea

I dont want to push anything so I agree and try to forget about it. 

Pretty fucking hard to forget considering this all happened 1.5 years after break up. 

Now today, I wake up after a vivid dream last night of us getting back together and hiding it from our friends so they dont get mad at us for rekindling. I´m with her family, were having pizza, watching tv and chatting. I´m having an amazing time.  Then I wake up. 

  
I´ve genuinely only spoken to one person about my lingering feelings for her throughout these last few months but man I need to get this shit off my chest. 

Im writing shit in my journal about her, im thinking about her almost everyday. How do people genuinely move on? 

Believe me I have tried almost everything and I feel like my last resort is going Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and somehow erasing the whole first relationship from my memory.

On paper, my life looked perfect. I had graduated from my dream university and landed a finance job — the exact career I'd fantasized about since I was 16. I had achieved everything I thought I wanted. But deep down, something felt terribly wrong.

I started to realize this path wasn't what I truly wanted for the rest of my life. That realization sent me spiraling into the darkest period of my existence. I now recognize it as depression, though at the time I didn't have words for it.

I struggled to get out of bed. My health deteriorated. I constantly questioned the meaning of everything — why was I even here? What was the point? It felt like an existential and identity crisis happening simultaneously. The worst part? My thoughts became deafeningly loud. They were relentless, negative, and exhausting. I genuinely felt like I was losing my mind.

Then one morning, everything changed.

I woke up, and for the first time in months, there was silence. Complete, beautiful silence.

I went through my usual morning routine — shower, coffee, getting dressed. But after about an hour, something hit me: *Wait... why don't I have any negative thoughts? Why does everything look so bright? Why do I feel so... peaceful?*

In that moment, I was fully present in a way I'd never experienced before. The world came alive around me. Colors were vivid. The grass felt soft and real under my feet. I could feel the wind on my skin and the warmth of the sun. Everything felt beautiful — almost like I was high, but I wasn't on anything.

That's when I learned the most important spiritual lesson of my life:

**I am not my thoughts. I am the observer.**

My thoughts had been screaming at me for months, telling me I was lost, hopeless, stuck. But that morning showed me that those thoughts were just noise — not truth, not reality, not me. The real me was the awareness witnessing those thoughts, the consciousness that could observe them without being consumed by them.

This realization didn't fix everything overnight, but it fundamentally changed how I related to my own mind. When dark thoughts came back (and they do), I could recognize them as temporary weather patterns rather than permanent truth.

I share this because I believe almost everyone goes through periods like this — dark, stressful, seemingly endless. When you're in it, you can't imagine a way out. But the clouds do pass. The universe showed me that even in my darkest moment, there was a deeper peace waiting underneath all the noise.

There are bills, temptations, and random life stuff that always seems to pop up. But having savings isn’t just about money it’s about peace of mind. Here’s a simple, realistic and my personal approach to start:

**1. Start small.**  
Don’t wait for extra money to begin. Even setting aside a small amount ₹100 or $10 a week is a win. What matters is building the habit not how much you start with.

**2. Know where your money goes.**  
For one month, just track your spending. You’ll be surprised how many little things add up coffee runs food delivery random online buys awareness is the first step to change.

**3. Give your savings a purpose.**  
It’s easier to save when you know why. Maybe it’s an emergency fund, travel plans, or your future self’s comfort. A goal keeps you motivated.

**4. Automate it.**  
f possible, set up an auto-transfer right after payday. When saving becomes automatic, you don’t have to rely on willpower every month.

**5. Build a small emergency fund.**  
Try to save enough to cover at least 3 months of expenses. Life happens and when it does, you’ll be thankful for this safety net.

**6. Be mindful with spending.**  
Before buying something, pause and ask, “Do I really need this, or do I just want it right now?” It’s not about saying no to everything just about being conscious.

**7. Once you’re stable, learn to invest.**  
When your basic savings are in place, start exploring investments mutual funds, index funds, or anything low-risk to begin with. That’s how your money starts working *for* you.

We were introduced through our families, my mom and sister even suggested I get to know her. For about a year, we had on-and-off communication on Instagram. She always said she was very focused on school (she’s studying medicine). She is from another city, but has moved to my city to follow her studies. She attends a private school on a scholarship and has to keep her grades at a certain level in order to maintain it.

We met once at a family lunch. We didn’t really talk much there, but the vibe felt really positive. Her family seemed to like me a lot. Three days later, I messaged her saying I had been thinking about her, but she told me she didn’t see me the same way anymore. I found out her family told her I was a great guy and she should’ve given me a chance. He mother even said she was upset about her daughter’s reply to me, and said she said that without thinking.

After some time, she deactivated her Instagram. Meanwhile, I went out with other girls, but honestly, none of them clicked. When she reactivated her account after a few months, I reached out, told her I was thinking about her, and she asked why. I said I didn’t really know, just felt like she’s the one I want to be with. She said she liked my courage, but was afraid that getting to know someone would distract her from her studies. She didn’t want me to accuse her in the future for a lack of commitment. I told her to at least meet for a coffee first and then we will see about what we will fight for in the future.

We agreed to meet for a coffee. The coffee went well, vibes were warm and positive. Afterward, I asked if she wanted to meet again, and she said “ok.” A few hours later, I messaged saying I had a good time; she replied that she did too. I joked that it took me a year to go out with her, but it was worth it. She replied that she wasn’t sure yet, but we will see.

Since then, I’ve messaged her three times, and she’s left me on delivered every time.

I would’ve appreciated it more if she would just tell me she isn’t interested instead and of just acting like this.

As such most of her time has been spent recovering a recuperating enjoying the break she had from work. She had even met with a divination specialist at a cafe which would be useful in the future. She looked up at the empty sky and her time token. ""Maybe I'll visit the office"" she thought as she decided to test out her 1st theory.*  
  
*To test her theory she visited her unit and bought hot coffee. As she entered she had a slight smile on her face as she gave a different type of coffee to the others. She had a quick chat with her colleagues, talked about how certain people wished to leave the safety of the city and bets on weather patterns. It was a pleasant experience though a nostalgic feeling gnawed at her. She knew exactly what every one of her colleagues needed from a mix of powers, experience and habits but she did not feel her potion digest. Crouched on a rooftop, looking down below at the ground, she sipped on the coffee and tried thinking of new theories.*

*A thick stench of alcohol hung in the air, not unusual for a casino. Janice had no taste for such things, she found no enjoyment in games of chance like cards but she believed it might aid in her understanding of the Telepathist Potion. She sat down at a poker table with 2 strangers. One was a large bulky man with a shiny forehead, menacing eyes and a reddish moustache that curled, the other was a much scrawnier man dressed rather elegantly, the scent of an expensive rose perfume, he looked much more calm and collected than the other man,*

*The game began and the cards were dealt. (I have no idea how poker works). Janice controlled her emotions and easily saw through each bluff but received no feedback from the potion. She changed tactics and deliberately broke character, just for that tiny moment a display of displeasure. Bait was successful, both players raised and lost out to Janice’s hand. She felt some of her potion digest which meant she was on the right track.*

*She went to various locations in Varnheim making small talk with its residents. She gathered a plentitude of information from people of all perspectives learning about their problems and troubles. She secretly influenced them to help with their lives and she invested her time and effort into others. Understanding them as a whole, she finally understood what that a telepathist, influences others in a discreet and logical way.*

Every morning I wake up and go to the bathroom and it's the most unpleasant and disgusting movement. It hurts coming out. It hurts when I wipe. The toilet paper is covered in faeces from one wipe. I don't even know how physically it is ending up not just on my anus but on my cheeks, perineum, in my butt hair, despite it only taking a few seconds to come out. Sometimes it leaves a big stain on the toilet bowl.

I end up spending 15 minutes using paper, bidet, and wipes just to get to the point where there isn't a huge patch of brown on every wipe. Sometimes I feel compelled to shower too even if I didn't really need one beforehand.

Probiotics don't help, psyllium husk doesn't help unless I take it in huge quantities in which case I end up having to go 5 times a day.

I eat a pretty healthy diet. Wholemeal bread and salad for lunch. Pasta or stir fry for dinner. I eat bananas and apples, peanut butter. No coffee, alcohol, or sodas. I even gave up sweets and chocolate a month ago though I occasionally have a sweet pastry. I think I will try and give up dairy again, though typically it hasn't given me so much trouble in the past.

The only time I get easy to clean movements is when I'm constipated for a few days (which happens rarely). Even when I get diarrhoea it's a bit of a relief, because at least it's relatively easy to clean after.

Sometimes it felt like we were completely in sync, like he saw me better than anyone else ever did. And then, other times, it felt like he didn’t even want to be near me.

We ended thing because I couldn handle the feeling of being unwanted anymore. He didn't want to go to therapy or thalk thing throug at the time, and I took it as him not caring enough to fight for us. Moth later, after the breakup, he started thjerapy. I focused on myself, tried to heal, even I started dating again. But I still though about him a lot, also I had a lot of dreams about him.

We work together so we eventually ran into each other. He told me I looked nice, and I invited him to come with me for my daily coffee walk. And to my suprise, he said yes. it was first real calm conversation we had in moths. He even blocked me month prior. I told him, even for me out of the nowhere, that I's still love him and I am open to trying again someday, slowly, if we both wanted to. He tomld me that his therapits thinks he's on the autism spectrum, probably a mild form.

That moment hit me hard, Suddenly so many things made sense - the emotional distance, the mixed signals, how he could love me but still need so much space. It wasn’t cruelty. It was just how his brain worked.

I don’t know what to do with that understanding. I’m not planning to chase him or pressure him, but it’s been on my mind nonstop. We message a bit for work, nothing deep, and that’s fine. But par ot me cant stop wondering if it could actually work now - of both people knew what they were really dealing with.

Pokédex Entry #000: The Moonveil Pokémon

Type: Dark/Fighting
Nature: Quietly Curious
Ability: Overthink (occasionally activates “Deep Talk” mode after midnight)

…

Usually seen during midnight hours, strolling beneath the stars with Jigglypuff earbuds and a faraway look, the kind that makes you wonder if she’s thinking about the universe, or which starter she’d choose for forever.

Chibi-cute with a soft, very huggable build, this Pokémon proves that power comes in the most adorable forms. Evolves best in quiet places, surrounded by books, coffee cups, and half-finished journal pages. Known to befriend Eevees, resonate with Snorlax energy, and embody Mimikyu-level introversion.

…

Moveset:

🩷 Quality Time — increases bond level with chosen Trainer

💫 Acts of Service — restores morale and warmth over time

🌙 Deep Conversation — super effective against emotional distance

🔥 Sarcastic Banter — low damage, high charm

…

Habitat:
Found in cozy places filled with anime marathons, story-rich games, and the soft glow of movie credits. Currently solo living and leveling up in peace, though sometimes, she wishes someone was player two.

Personality Notes:
A lover of stories, whether told through books, shows, or games. Dreamy yet grounded, introverted yet passionate, a little quiet until you ask the right question.

…

Trainer Compatibility:
Seeks someone smart, genuine, and romantic enough to match her pace under the moonlight. The kind who enjoys deep talks, trades playlists, and doesn’t rush to the next Gym battle. Bonus XP if you know your lore, your Eeveelutions, and how to turn silence into comfort.

…

If you think we’d make a good duo, throw a Pokéball my way. 
Just be warned: I’m more Umbreon than Pikachu and my love’s a rare spawn.

Oh, and don’t just say hi, tell me who your favorite Pokémon is, and why.

Hi folks. I am sure this has been mentioned before but this info is for the newer members. If you’re wanting to cut costs and have a nice variety of coffees to choose from consider this: Buy Keurig cups of your choice, remove the lids and pour contents into a 7.7oz empty pod. Use silicone lids or foil. Brew as mug or double espresso. The coffee will foam nicely and you be surprised at the taste delivered. It’s also very cost effective as those pods are much cheaper to buy from your local grocery. Just requires a bit of your time and effort. ",0,1761306419.0,nespresso,1,0.2,False

Among the trusted names in handcrafted furniture, Rameshwaram Arts and Crafts stands out for its exquisite designs that combine traditional artistry with modern functionality.

# Why Choose Gold Furnitures

Gold has always been associated with luxury and timelessness. When incorporated into furniture, it elevates the aesthetic of a room instantly. From gilded chairs and side tables to intricate cabinets and beds, gold furnitures pieces act as statement elements that draw attention and admiration. Beyond looks, these pieces are often crafted to last, ensuring that the investment adds value to your home for years to come.

# Choosing the Right Gold Furniture Pieces

When selecting golds furniture, balance is key. Overloading a room with too many gold accents can make it feel flashy rather than elegant.

# Incorporating Gold Furniture in Different Rooms

# Living Room

A gold-accented sofa or coffee table can instantly become the centerpiece of your living area.

Gold side tables or console units can also add sophistication to corners that might otherwise go unnoticed.

# Bedroom

Gold furniture in the bedroom creates a serene yet opulent retreat. Consider a bed frame with delicate gold carvings or a gilded dresser. Accents like gold-trimmed mirrors or bedside tables can complement the main furniture pieces, adding depth and warmth to the room.

Investing in handcrafted pieces from a reputable brand like Rameshwaram Arts and Crafts ensures quality materials that are designed to last.

Just trying to find something that doesn’t wreck my stomach or make me dread lunch.

Read about one brand bragging twenty different nutrients with folic acid, DHA, and all that. Gummies, capsules, or softgels? Methylfolate or regular folic acid? Iron or no iron if I already run low? I’ve read so many takes I’m dizzy.

I’ve been eyeing Ritual for the delayed release thing, but my sister swears by Nature Made because it doesn’t upset her stomach. If you’ve tried both, did you notice a real difference or just better lab numbers? Does splitting the dose actually help? Also, any issues with fish-based DHA, or is algae the safer bet?

Timing’s another mess. Some people say take it with food, others at night, then there’s the whole coffee and calcium thing messing with iron.

1oevdpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1oevdpi/protein_powder_with_less_allergens/,Protein Powder (with less allergens?),"I used to take protein powder 3-4 times a week as a supplement when I couldn't get enough protein from proper meals.

I've started with Dymatize ISO 100 and Dymatize Elite, then switched to a local brand because of the price. The local one felt (literally, the texture) like it wasn't a healthy one, so I went up the price again for Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard.   
  
After a week or two, I noticed some skin rashes on my belly, ribs, and face, and they were getting worse by the day. I didn't realize it was the powder at the beginning until I researched online and found some posts about protein powders.  
So I've stopped, and it took another 6 weeks to go away. Then tried a protein bar from another local company (never tried that one before), which triggered it again immediately.

I'm struggling to pass the 100g of protein per day, and I need this extra 3-4 times a week.  
So I wonder whether to go back to Dymatize, which was okay, but I'm not sure if it was a specific allergen within the ON (or the protein bar) or if I just somehow crossed a threshold.   
It's not lactose intolerance (I think) because I drink \~250ml of milk (in coffee) and eat regular dairy products and protein yogurts.

I've compared the ingredient lists for Dymatize and ON, and the main suspect was Ace-K sweetener. But it also exists in many other products worldwide, so I cannot tell for sure.

My main question is: should I go back to Dymatize, which I know was okay, or are there other, more ""pure"" options (like MyProtein Unflavoured, which is basically whey and emulsifiers)?",1,1761305921.0,workout,1,1.0,False

It was Sunday morning when my mom casually mentioned [she’d found “the perfect boy” for me](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), again. Jatt family, well-settled in Brampton, same caste, his [parents owned three Tim Hortons franchises](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). She showed me his [photo with that look that said, “This is the one.”](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)

I smiled and nodded, feeling my phone buzz with a text from Aravind: [“Lunch at our spot?” Our spot](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). The little [South Indian restaurant in Surrey where we’d had our first date six years ago](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), where he’d nervously asked if I wanted to try dosa, [where I’d fallen completely in love with this quiet](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), [brilliant man ](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)who saw me — really saw me — in ways no one ever had.

Six years of hiding. S[ix years of “working late” and elaborate lies](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). Six years of being two people: the [obedient Punjabi daughter](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) my parents raised, and [the woman who’d chosen her own love story.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)

# Growing Up Between Two Worlds

I’m [Canadian-born, raised in Vancouver’s Punjabi community](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). My parents [immigrated in the ’90s, worked brutal hours](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) to build a life here. I grew up speaking [Punjabi at home, English everywhere else](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). Bharatnatyam classes on [Saturdays, gurdwara on Sundays, summers in Punjab](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

I excelled — [UBC computer science, software engineering at a major tech company, my own condo downtown](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). I was everything they’d dreamed of. [*Except I’d fallen in love with someone they’d never approve of*](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)*.*

Aravind moved to[ Canada eight years ago from Chennai for his master’s at SFU](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). We met at work during a cross-team project. [He was thoughtful, wickedly smart, had this dry humor that caught me off guard](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

The day I realized I loved him, [we were debugging code at 2 AM](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). He looked up, exhausted, and said, “You know what I miss about Chennai? Filter coffee at 3 AM with my amma.” [That vulnerability made my heart flip.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)

We started dating quietly. [His family back in Chennai was progressive — they wanted him happy](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). But he knew [my reality was different.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)

# The Weight of “Log Kya Kahenge”

My parents’ entire [social life revolved around the Punjabi community](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) in Vancouver and Surrey. The [gurdwara, Punjabi functions, family friends who’d known me since birth](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). Every aunty had [opinions about appropriate matches.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)

[“South Indian?” I could already hear the whispers](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). “They’re so different. [Different food, different customs.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) How will she adjust?”

The pressure [intensified as I approached 30](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). “[*You’re getting too old*](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)*,*” my mom would say. “[Best boys get picked fast](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).”

[The log kya kahenge anxiety was paralyzing ](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)— what will people say? The fear of [disappointing my immigrant parents](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), of [bringing shame to our family’s izzat.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)

# When Love Meets Cultural Reality

Six years in, [Aravind and I knew we wanted marriage](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). We’d built a life together. We’d spent [Diwalis together (hiding from my parents’ parties), celebrated Pongal, learned each other’s languages badly](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). We’d created our own third culture — [Canadian, but honoring both our roots.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)

But the [lying was destroying me](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). Every [family dinner felt like betrayal](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). They’d raised me to be[ strong, independent, educated](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). But apparently, that [independence had limits](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

Three months ago, my dad started getting serious about finding matches. “[We’ve waited long enough](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb),” he said. “[But now it’s time](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).”

That night, I called Aravind crying. “[I can’t keep doing this](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). But if I tell them — “ The [fear of parental disownment was too real](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

“[We both deserve better](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb),” he said quietly. “[I can’t keep being your secret](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).”

He was right. But the [thought of losing my family felt paralyzing](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

# Finding Support From My Own Culture

I [couldn’t talk to anyone in my community](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) — one wrong word and everyone would know. I needed [someone who understood the cultural weight without extensive explanations](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

My [coworker mentioned **coto**](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). “They have practitioners from our communities,” she said. “[Real people who get it — available 24/7, no AI, no appointments weeks away.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)”

Late [one night after another tense family dinner](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), I opened [coto’s platform and found practitioners who were South Asian themselves ](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)— people who [inherently understood what I was facing](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

# How Astrology Gave Me the Courage I Needed

My [first session with Payal started with understanding my full story ](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)— being Canadian-born versus Aravind being an immigrant, [the specific Punjabi community dynamics, my guilt, my fear](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

[Then Payal created an **Astro Love — Mini Transit Read** for my situation](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). This [wasn’t about predicting the future ](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)— it was about understanding the [cosmic energies affecting my ability to take action *right now*](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

The [reading revealed Venus moving through my 7th house of partnerships](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), creating a [powerful push toward authentic commitment](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). Mars was [supporting bold action, though squaring my Saturn](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) — which explained perfectly [why I felt this internal war between courage and obligation](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). We were [approaching a Full Moon in my 1st house of self](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) — one of the most [powerful times for stepping into your authentic identity](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

**Here’s what this actually meant for me:** The reading showed that the [universe was creating optimal conditions for truth-telling](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). The courage I’d been struggling to [find wasn’t just “in my head”](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) — it was being cosmically supported. Knowing [there was an astrologically favorable window](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) gave me a [deadline and a sense](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) that the timing was finally right.

Payal [helped me understand that my fear wasn’t just emotional ](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)— Saturn’s influence explained [why I felt such heavy obligation to family duty](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). But [Mars and Venus together were creating a rare alignment](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) that would [support bold, heart-centered action](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

**This cosmic timing gave me two things I desperately needed:** First, [confidence that this wasn’t just impulsive](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), the stars were literally aligning. Second, a [specific timeframe (the Full Moon)](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) that pushed me to act instead of waiting another six years.

[Beyond the astrology, Payal provided](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb):

**Cultural Understanding Without Explanation:** Being South Asian herself, [she knew what “izzat” meant](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), why the [threat of disownment was real](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), the [specific dynamics of Punjabi family structures](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

**Real-Time Support:** When [panic hit the day before I planned](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) to tell my parents, I could message Payal immediately. [**Real human guidance exactly when I needed it** — not AI](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), but someone from my culture who understood.

**Practical Action Steps:** Payal helped me craft what to say, when to say it ([during that favorable Full Moon](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)), how to hold [boundaries while showing respect.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)

# The Conversation I’d Been Avoiding

[Two weeks later](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), during the Full Moon Payal identified, I told my parents about Aravind.

I’d [invited Aravind to “accidentally” stop by during Sunday dinner](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). When my mom saw him with flowers and mithai, [her face went through five emotions](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

“This is Aravind,” I said, voice shaking but steady. “We’ve [been together for six years](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). He’s the [person I’m going to marry](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). I’m [not asking permission](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) — I’m [telling you because I love you](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). But this is [happening either way](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).”

The [silence was deafening](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

My dad walked out. My mom started crying. “[South Indian? Six years and you lied to us? What will people say?](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)”

Aravind [spoke to my mom in his broken Punjabi](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), told her about his family, his intentions. He [answered every question with respect](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

My [mom asked him to leave](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). My dad didn’t speak to me for two weeks.

[But I’d done it. The secret was out](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

# The Long Road to Acceptance

The first month was brutal. My mom called crying. My dad alternated [between silence and lectures](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). Relatives [called with intrusive questions](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

But Payal’s [continued support kept me grounded](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). When my resolve wavered — I [could connect with her immediately](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). No waiting days. Just real support when I was struggling.

[Slowly, things shifted](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

My younger sister became my ally. “[I’m proud of you,](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)” she whispered. “[You did what I’m too scared to do](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).”

My dad’s brother — who’d married outside the community — called. “Your [dad didn’t talk to me for three years](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). But he came around. Give him time.”

Six weeks after, my mom started asking questions. “[What does he eat? What are his parents like?](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)”

Two months in, [my dad spoke to me about normal things](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). Progress.

Three months after, [my parents agreed to meet Aravind’s parents over video](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). It was awkward. But Aravind’s dad made a joke in terrible Punjabi. My dad laughed — actually laughed. They f[ound common ground talking about raising kids in a new country](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb), working brutal hours for their children’s opportunities.

# The Turning Point

Month four brought breakthrough. “[Bring him for dinner Sunday](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb),” my mom said. “[Your father wants to talk to him properly.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)”

That [Sunday was tense but civil](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). My dad asked [direct questions](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). [Aravind answered honestly](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

“[You waited six years?](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)” my dad asked.

“[I’d wait six more if I had to](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb),” Aravind replied. “[She’s worth it](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).”

Something [shifted in my dad’s expression](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). Not approval exactly, [but understanding.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)

# Building Bridges: Our Happy Ending

It’s [been eight months](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). The [transformation has been gradual but real](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

Last month, [my mom invited Aravind’s parents to Vancouver for a week](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). My [mom taught his mom to make aloo paratha](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). His mom taught mine to make perfect dosas. They spent hours in the kitchen, [eventually laughing over their stubborn children](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

My dad and Aravind’s dad bonded [over cricket and Canadian winters](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

At the gurdwara, when aunties whispered, [my mom held her head high](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). One made a pointed comment about “[children forgetting culture](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).” My mom looked her straight in the eye: “[My daughter chose a good man who respects her. Culture isn’t just about who you marry — it’s about the values you live by.](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)”

I almost cried.

We’re [planning our fusion wedding for next July](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). [Anand Karaj ceremony](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) in the morning at the gurdwara. [South Indian rituals in the evening](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). Both [families planning together, finding joy in blending our cultures](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

My dad recently told me, “We [didn’t leave Punjab so you could live](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb) the same limited life we knew. [We left so you could have choices](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). I forgot that. I’m sorry.”

Aravind’s [mom calls my mom “samdhan ji” now](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). They video call twice a week, [sharing recipes and laughing](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). They’re planning a trip to visit both [Punjab and Tamil Nadu next year](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb).

The aunties who gossiped now [ask for his amma’s sambar recipe](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb). My parents’ friends tell their children, [“See? Love marriages can work.”](https://app.coto.world/VWreBAcZIXb)

I tried chicory coffee and I can tolerate the taste enough but I wonder what other alternatives are there? I need my cup of comfort per day. I’m thinking of matcha but I’ve never made it at home plus the packs are tiny and insanely expensive but I’m willing to try, have any of you had stomach ache from coffee or matcha? Or have any of you replaced coffee with matcha?

My diet is relatively healthy I would say, so nothing in my diet should give me stomach pain I’m 100% sure it’s the coffee especially if I drink it in the morning on an empty stomach because I just can’t eat early.

Hi everyone! I'm planning a 5-week trip through Colombia. I'll be traveling solo until November 22, and then my boyfriend will join me. I work remotely about two days per week (flexible schedule). I'd love your thoughts—especially if I'm missing any must-do experiences.

* Solo travel until Nov 22
* Couple travel from Nov 23 onward
* Arrival and departure via Bogotá
* Remote work: \~2 days/week

My boyfriend isn’t into heights or extreme activities (so I’m saving the wild stuff for my solo days). He’s excited about hiking and beach time, so I’m trying to create a mix of nature, culture, and relaxation. But wow—choosing is hard.



**Week 1: Arrival and Adventure**

* Nov 2: Bogotá – Evening arrival, overnight near the airport
* Nov 3–6: Villa de Leyva – Charming town, wine tasting, Pozos Azules, remote work
* Nov 7–9: San Gil – Rafting, paragliding, canyoning (solo adventure time)
* Nov 10–11: Barichara – Colonial village, hike to Guane, remote work



**Week 2: City Life and Coffee Region**

* Nov 12: Travel to Medellín (via Bucaramanga)
* Nov 13–16: Medellín (El Poblado) – Comuna 13, Pueblito Paisa, dance class, remote work
* Nov 17–20: Jardín – Coffee farms, hiking, viewpoints, remote work
* Nov 21: Guatapé – Climb Piedra del Peñol
* Nov 22: Travel to Salento



**Week 3: Reunited and Exploring Together**

* Nov 23: Flight to Bogotá → reunite with boyfriend
* Nov 23–26: Medellín – City stay, nightlife, remote work
* Nov 27–28: Filandia – Scenic mountain town, viewpoints, Helena Adentro restaurant
* Nov 29–30: Salento – Cocora Valley hike, coffee farm tours

**Week 4–5: Caribbean Coast and Jungle Trek**

* Dec 1: Flight to Santa Marta – Trek briefing and rest
* Dec 2–6: Ciudad Perdida – 5-day jungle trek (solo again)
* Dec 7–8: Minca – Recovery days, Lazy Cat Café, Casa Elemento, light remote work
* Dec 9–10: Palomino – Beach, tubing, kitesurfing, final rest days
* Dec 10 (night): Bogotá – Return flight home



**Questions for the community:**

* Am I missing any unforgettable experiences?
* Is the pacing okay or too rushed?
* Any tips for remote work-friendly cafés or places?
* Would you swap anything out?

Thanks in advance!

Today i wanna share with you some of my success stories this month cuz it’s been a very very good month for me (so grateful) and of course the steps and how i do it. 

So to preface im kinda clueless when i first discovered the law , i’ve been deep on law of attraction for the longest time but my bestie told me about loass. 

My manifested lists for this month is 
1. I graduated bachelor degree on time
2. A week free trips on 5 star resorts 
3. Free plane tickets
4. Free motogp ticket
5. And the last one is i manifested other income streams which is a business for myself :) (im on my way to opening my beauty salon bar) 

So far the best methods for me is robotic affirmations, subliminals, and visualising. Sometimes i also script if i want to. 
I don’t really have specific routines everyday to manifest, i just do robotic affirmations for some time in a day whenever the thoughts of my desire is came up to my mind. Before sleep, i visualise and scripting while listening to subliminals. But not everyday, instead i focus more on living as a person who already have those desires and enjoying my daily life (such as going to work, making breakfast, making my matcha or coffee, talk to my friends on the phone, going to the gym, painting, playing sudoku, etc) 

I will continue to share my other success stories here and giving some tips (for each desire) and the stories behind it.

🎬 THE DIAGNOSIS: A STAGE 4 THREAT

2014. The words hit like a physical blow: Stage 4 Marginal Zone Lymphoma. My doctor's prescription? ""Watch and wait.""
Watch. And. Wait.
I was trapped in a cold war with my own body. Every fiber of my being screamed for action, for an all-out assault, but I was forced into a maddening, passive truce. I was living with a ticking clock, and the waiting felt worse than the disease itself.

💥 THE BREAKING POINT

Two years of that quiet tension finally shattered. My system rebelled. Seizures. My liver and kidneys started to act up—the critical systems changing.
I knew, with a certainty that only a patient can possess, that my current command wasn't working. I knew my body. I walked out, found a new oncologist , and issued a single order: ACT.
In two days, the counterattack began.

🔥 THE INFUSION

The first dose of Rituxan was a brutal interrogation. The pain, an agonizing fire that ripped through me, was almost unbearable. They told me it was a side effect, a one-time betrayal, but in that moment, it felt like the cure was trying to kill me faster than the cancer.
But I endured. Because the second, third, and fourth infusions? They were different. They were quiet. They were working.
By the third treatment, the numbers told the story: Normal. The enemy had been driven back.
I stayed on the offensive for two years until the very weapon that saved me—the Rituxan—turned toxic. Now, the battle is fought in the monitoring room. Eight years. Every three months, the blood is drawn, the fate of my body is written in the labs, and every three months, I keep walking away victorious.
The war is never truly over. But I am winning the day.

☕ ACT II: THE RELAPSE, RHEUMATOID REMIX

Fast-forward eight years. EIGHT YEARS! That's long enough to grow a whole new person, learn a new language, or, apparently, develop Rheumatoid Arthritis. Just when you think your body is done with its dramatic performances, it starts a new residency.
I’m sitting there, getting my routine RA blood draw. My rheumatologist—a lovely woman, truly—calls me back two weeks later with that specific tone of medical curiosity that is never a good sign. ""The test looks... different,"" she says. She wanted a re-test. I obliged.
She calls back again. The politeness has been replaced by professional concern. ""I think you need to go see your oncologist.""

🧠 THE GREAT DENIAL PERIOD

My brain instantly hit the giant, flashing DENIAL button. ""Nonsense! It's just the RA messing with my weird, complicated blood!""
To prove them all wrong, I marched straight to my Primary Care Doctor, two weeks after the rheumatologist's warning (because I'm a mature adult who listens to medical advice immediately). Guess what she said? ""Go see your oncologist.""
At this point, my internal circuits were fried. Three doctors, two different specialties, one unified message: The old enemy is at the gates.

🛎️ LYMPHOMA: CHECKING IN

I finally called Emory. And sure enough, the diagnostics came back: Marginal Zone Lymphoma is visiting again.
""Oh, hello,"" I muttered to my body. ""Did you stop by for a cup of coffee? Because the last time we hung out, things got pretty messy.""
But this time, there is no polite, agonizing ""Watch and Wait."" We are skipping the small talk and going straight to the main event. We are hitting hard.
Rituxan starts in two weeks. Bring it on.

🧬 THE FAMILY CURSE (OR, WHAT ARE THE ODDS?)

And recent — and it’s been gnawing at me. So, Reddit, here’s my story about how my long-time therapist, a man I trusted for 15 years, decided to get weird and “fall in love” with me.

Let’s call him *Dr. Hill.*

This goes back about 15 years to when my dad got really sick. I’m an only child with a codependent mom, and the pressure was enormous. Not only am I an only child, I happen to also be a daughter in an Italian household. That means my father’s care wasn’t optional — it was a full-time emotional obligation. Naturally, I started having panic attacks. At work, at home, even in the grocery store. It felt like I was vibrating inside a foggy cocoon that was closing in on me.

So I went searching for help. After a few failed therapist attempts, I found Dr. Hill. His website said he specialized in anxiety disorders — jackpot. From our first session, I finally felt *safe.* For the first time in years, I could breathe.

Weeks turned into months, months into years. The panic attacks faded. Over time, our sessions evolved from crisis management to “tune-ups,” as he called them. We talked about life, cooking, local news — comfortable stuff. But still, always professional.

And because we'd reached this casual state in our professional relationship, he even came to my dad’s celebration of life. Met my mom. Everyone close to me knew how much I admired Dr. Hill. He’d been my anchor through grief, panic, and rebuilding.

Fast-forward to this February. I was losing my health insurance, so I scheduled one last “tune-up.” About two months after that, I emailed him suggesting a casual coffee sometime — not as therapy, just a friendly catch-up while I got back on my feet.

A few days later, he replied:

""What's your cell number?""

Not strange, since we’d only ever emailed. I gave it to him. Weeks passed. Another message:

""Don't worry, I haven't forgotten...""

Then months went by. Life moved on.

Until October. My dog — my best friend — suddenly got very sick and I was thrust back into caregiver mode. Cue panic attacks, claustrophobia, flashbacks. Naturally, I reached out to Dr. Hill. I had insurance again, so I asked to book a real session.

His reply?

""Sure! You're one of my favorites.""

We scheduled it.

And for a little while, it felt like coming home. That safe, steady feeling returned — until it didn’t.

Somewhere between talking about my dog and stress management, he started telling me about his marriage problems. Then, half-jokingly, he said if we ever ended up together, we’d both be obese because we love to cook.

Uhh… what?

Then came talk about some “wilderness property” he’d like to live on. When I said I needed to live among civilization, he quickly backpedaled—*his wilderness property had manicured lawns, cute downtowns, and no neighbors for miles.* I remember thinking, *Is this guy picturing us there?*

And then the bomb. I was paying my co-pay, joking that I only had $12 cash left for Mega Millions tickets.

He laughed and said:

""If you win 500 million dollars, I'm firing you as my patient, so you can be my girlfriend."" 

…Excuse me, WHAT?!

My default reaction when boundaries get crossed is to freeze, make a joke, or brush it off. That’s something I’d worked on *with him.* So I laughed awkwardly and left. But something felt… contaminated.

I told a few close friends. Everyone agreed it was weird but maybe just awkward humor. So I waited.

Two weeks later, I’m sitting in a conference room with the CEO of my new company, and my phone lights up: **Dr. Hill is calling me.**

He’s never called before. *Ever.*

I silence it, thinking it might be an emergency. Then comes a text inviting me to lunch — 40 minutes away, not even in our town. When I say I can’t, he apologizes. Repeatedly. By text, then by email. At least ten times. Telling me how much he respects me, admires me, enjoys my company. How he never wanted to make me feel uncomfortable. He even calls himself an *“awkward dork.”*

It’s clear he’s spiraling.

And that’s when it hit me. The feeling I couldn’t name at first: **violated.**

My safe space — the one person I’d trusted for 15 years — had crossed the line in a way I never saw coming. The man who knew *exactly* what past boundary violations had done to me was now doing the same thing.

All I could think was: *Of course. Of course it ends like this.*

So, I mustered up the strength to email him and set the record straight. I apologized for initiating anything that could have been misunderstood when I invited him to coffee earlier in the year. And I told him clearly: I couldn’t be his patient anymore. I wished him well and closed the door.

But it wasn’t over.

Remember that codependent mother I mentioned? She doesn’t drive, so I take her grocery shopping. Just this past Tuesday, I’m sitting in the parking lot, working on my laptop while she’s inside. And suddenly — *his name screams across my phone screen again.*

**Dr. Hill.**

Fuck.

I pick up. His voice is nothing like him — high-pitched, shaky, almost frantic. He’s nervous, unmoored. He apologizes again and again, repeating how fond of me he is, how much he respects me. He even says it’s because he saw how I took care of my father.

That pissed me off. Because once again, he was using what he *knew* about me — the thing that broke me open all those years ago — as emotional leverage.

And that’s when I realized: this wasn’t love. It was control, confusion, and ego dressed up as affection.

Fifteen years of trust, undone by one man’s inability to keep his boundaries.

It took twenty-minutes to get him off the phone — and (hopefully) out of my life.",1,1761304599.0,u_Calm-Shift9497,0,1.0,False

The furniture, especially restaurant sofas, sets the tone for comfort, aesthetics, and luxury. In India’s fast-growing hospitality industry, restaurants are increasingly focusing on furniture that combines functionality with style. Among the many names in the market, one company stands tall as the leader — Best of Exports, widely recognized as the No.1 Restaurant Sofa Manufacturer in India.

# Why Furniture Matters in Restaurants

A restaurant is more than just a place to eat — it’s a space where people connect, celebrate, and relax. The right furniture transforms a simple meal into an experience. Sofas, in particular, define the comfort and character of the seating arrangement.

A well-crafted restaurant sofa serves multiple purposes:

* Enhances the restaurant’s interior theme.
* Provides ergonomic comfort for long dining hours.
* Utilizes space effectively while maintaining visual appeal.
* Reflects the brand identity of the establishment.

This is why restaurant owners today prefer working with trusted manufacturers who understand design, craftsmanship, and durability — and **Best of Exports** has mastered this art.

Post your full build so far and find out what synergies you have.

The window will officially close with the release of the final part. For that reason, I think I'll drop the finale a full week after this post.

This time, the options work a little different. There are 8 plant upgrades that require a prerequisite plant and 5 perks that don't.  
In exchange for 2 slots, you can take as many upgrades as you qualify for.

You have a total of **5 slots** to spend.

Magical items can be planted, but will only produce non-magical yields.

When used to upgrade a Melon-pult weapon, you're able to impose an additional 50 square feet of a status effect of your choice for every shot the weapon fires. The space maintains this effect for 1 week, but the accumulation of usable square footage stacks indefinitely.

I want to keep it that way for a while, and by a while I mean forever. 

Next weekend is Halloween, but this weekend is going to be a little bit tougher because it's going to be the first one off four different things, and it's been a tough road and right now to be honest I feel extremely manic and excited about quitting but this was a problem from years before.

In January 2017, I remember stopping weed with manic excitement, or as I like to call it ""chronic pleasure"". August 10, 2019 when I stopped on a particular date and that date (August 10th) it was a nightmare to be around at my family cottage but it wasn't intentional. I was just overly excited about quitting and at that time.  

I write stories all the time when I quit because it fills my time in the darkest days (the first week or two after quitting) and in one of my latest notes, I noted my plans to the four vices entirely, especially marijuana (and cigarettes too) alcohol and energy drinks I need to drink far less of.  

Earlier this week, my building manager had me block my neighbor on Facebook so they stopped harassing me. Even though they still come to my door at late hours. It's not really an issue because I have nothing really to give and I'm already up. If they woke me up at 3:00 a.m. and I had to give them half my beer case then yeah I'd be pretty upset but my building manager told me to block her right there when I was with her in the office, and also her worker said that I have to stop giving her money because I was just enabling her in her habits. 

Now I have no one to smoke with and that's a good thing and even at times when I quit and I did have people to smoke with I was able to pass on it just like I was with alcohol when I gave that up for over 145 days, but yet I couldn't with weed. 

Obviously many had suggested rehab or therapy but at this point it would be too little too late. I need to be the rehab and therapy and now that I can manage my finances better I thought I'd take a closer look at them. 

Monthly Spendings For Vices (updated now) 
- Weed: $0.00
- Alcohol: $15-30  
- Cigarettes: $0.00
- Energy Drinks: $0.00 (over priced) 
- Ground Coffee: $15-30 (the way to do it)

Before I was using my coffee maker way too much, and have a hard time regulating my caffeine, so the coffee maker probably wasn't the best idea. I remember filling it up to the rim twice with ground coffee, and it's a litre maker. So I'd have four 500ml mugs (2L) of triple-strenth coffee but haven't done that since the Winter. 

I should just fill it up once with maybe half strength coffee if I'm going to drink the entire leader because I had to fill it up all the way and drink two full 17oz mugs, and drink the entire pot.

Should I also not be spending any money on alcohol either? I thought $30 a month would be reasonable cuz I didn't even dollar per day, same thing with the coffee.   ",9,1761304043.0,povertyfinancecanada,4,0.74,False

He is confident, gentle, and had this teasing, audacious sense of humour. Our sessions were always relaxed and full of banter. He’d also text me after everysessions to ask how I was doing or to continue our jokes. I complimented him on his work and his drawings, which maybe added to the friendliness. I was comfortable with him sonce we have a common friend.

After 2 sessions, things got a bit… ambiguous. He started to seem physically more comfortable: touching my hair, holding eye contact that kind of thing. Once, while joking around, he even whispered “je suis amoureux” (“I’m in love”) and laughed it off. He even joked that I can be back just for a coffee or that we can come to climbing room together (idk if it’s just a joke or not since he laughed it off directly, so I just say yes in the moment but he never actually insist or send out real invitation). When we said goodbye after sessions: from nothing, to cheek-to-cheek bises French way -> lips-to-cheek then a real smooche paired with a hug.

Since the smooche, I’ve set a small boundary to keep things clear (didn’t want it to feel inappropriate). Now he’s still friendly, teasing around but sometimes his answers would turn cold all of sudden. He has never compliments me on anything personal or insists on a 1-1 date.

I’m not trying to pursue anything. I’m just curious: based on this, do you think he was flirting vs me, or was he just a naturally warm, teasing guy who meant nothing deeper?",1,1761303707.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

I (30) have moved away from my family to live in the same city as my boyfriends family. My family is +12 hours away. We normally hang out weekly. 

My boyfriends sister got her first baby about 6 months ago. It is the only baby in their family, and I do also not have any babies on my side of the family, so i do not have any ”experience” on the topic.

Since before the baby was born, every outing, every cup of coffee, every car ride has been baby themed. We no longer have a conversation with any family member which does not get 180:d in to a conversation about the baby.

Someone explaining that they got a promotion? Cool, but yesterday we saw this new brand of diapers and look at him making a funny face.
Someone explaining something that happened to them? Oh but last week we did this and that with the baby…

I/we have been asked to download apps which sole purpose is for us to get direct picture updates of the baby, where if you didnt download and connect (cause i guess it was visible who wasnt connected) you would get written reminders to please connect please connect.

We have for the last years had a family group chat which is now used as a daily/several times a day update of videos and pictures of the baby etc.

Is this normal? As mentioned, no babies on my side of the family, but i find it strange that there is no single conversation between a group of adults which can not revolve about anything else. What about how was your day? Do you have something nice planned? Whatever.

My general feeling is that i would like to disengage and spend my time with others/at home. I have also put the family chat on mute as i cannot just deal with it anymore. AITH?",7,1761303485.0,AITH,5,0.9,False

1oeukyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1oeukyh/it_seems_to_be_emotional_abuse/,It seems to be emotional abuse…,"Long read…

At the beginning of our relationship, my husband was the most understanding and caring person what I ever met. I felt like I had found my person finally. We got married so that I could stay in his country with him. 

I lost very expensive tickets to a my country because I decided to be with him. I left my job and my lifestyle behind. We started working together. He is a tattoo artist, and I started doing piercings, learning tattooing, talking to his clients, cleaning his tattoo spot, and so on. I even designed his tattoo books, business cards, flyers, and other things, like little branding. I invested some money as well. And after a few months, it began…

He started getting upset with me because of my tone of voice whenever I asked him for something. One time he got offended because I asked him in the morning to make me coffee, because “I could do it myself”. He criticized the way I interacted with clients. I speak English better, and I tried to help him with translation. He’s a Spanish speaker. Our clients mostly don’t speak Spanish. But he felt like I was humiliating him in front of clients.

Before, I used to work as a spicy dancer. And since I was making all our banners, one day I accidentally inserted my old QR code that led to my rather erotic second page of insta. Because we are on the ground floor of a hotel and the banner was placed at the reception desk, he got extremely angry at me, saying that I embarrassed him in front of everyone. I also was pretty stressed, but….  He didn’t think at all about how I felt. He said that now everyone thinks I’m selling sexual services. And it’s a shame for him. I have to say sorry for reception manager, what I have done. 

He started to have episodes of jealousy if I simply talked to men clients or our neighbor for too long. He got angry that I have male friends in another countries who sometimes just ask how I am doing. Everyone knows I’m married. He saw the messages — there was nothing inappropriate. But he still got mad. 

One time he got mad because I danced “too provocatively” at a party… with him. But colleges saw it. Because I went up to the DJ to ask him to play my song. And was dancing a little there. Because it’s where for my opinion are dancing people who aren’t up for conservations. Because he didn’t want to dance with me. He forbade me from wearing short skirts at work, saying that all men are looking at me and that I attract attention.

One time he had to pick up some furniture and other things from his ex. I offered to go with him because I wanted to help naively, and in my world you can have a good relations with ex. Especially he claimed it was just 3 months and it wasn’t that serious. He refused abruptly. When I asked “why” he said he didn’t want to make his ex feel uncomfortable. And asked me why I even wanted to do it? To showed up that I am better than his ex, and that he is mine now? We were already married…

In this new country, I almost don’t have any friends. His friends didn’t accept me, because he started spending less time with them. I didn’t understand why we couldn’t all spend time together. But it seemed like they blamed me and thought he had changed because of me. Even though it was the opposite. He was the one who didn’t want to go to parties anymore. And somehow it also wasn’t allowed for me. Or for example he said he didn’t understand why I even kept sometimes texting my old friends to check up on them. Or why I even talking all day with my best friend gf who is far from me.  

When we had hard times, and I started working as a webcam model, he sort of “allowed” it. I was actually bringing pretty good money into our household. I didn’t keep anything for myself. We spend all together. But he got angry that I wasn’t cleaning or cooking, and that I wasn’t giving him enough attention — well, because I was working 10 hours a day, and he actually 5…

When we were constantly fighting and on a stage of brake up, one of his male coworkers from the hotel messaged me. I wasn’t flirting, but I did keep the conversation going answering. The coworker was openly flirting, and I tried to just brush it off. But didn’t stop
It. Like a week. Then I did stop it eventually and block him, because that guy was really too much annoying. And when my hus and I kinda broke up, I send him all that conversation. He got angry and… he started accusing me of betrayal. Because I was answering. He also told our coworkers about it. And then he said that I had embarrassed him in front of everyone. Although sometimes I have seen that he had to warm conversation with other girls like “I am so anxious to meet you when you will come. Miss you a lot.” But he told that it’s just stile of talking in his Latino culture. I swallowed it. 

He could start a fight over the fact that I woke up late (I have insomnia). When I was working night shifts at the studio, he was also angry that I slept too long. 

Also during arguments, he gets personal too often and can insult me. Like “perra”, “malparida”, “puta”, etc…. One time he hit me. He touch my fresh piercing, I had a strong pain. And said “aw, please be careful”, but he got angry and started insulting me. I wanted to slap him, but he took my hand in the air, and hit me. The other time he hit refrigerator instead of me. And than was few days complaining how his hand does hurt. 

When we were fighting and I was away, he brought another woman into our home. And they slept in the same bed. He says she was just a friend and that nothing happened. But… I found out about it by accident, and … he started blaming me for it. Claiming he did it because I have been responding to messages from his coworker (who was flirting). He also didn’t tell her when we got back together, and he complained to her about me, that I didn’t clean and didn’t cook and I don’t know what else. And in the end, he just ghosted her. Stopped answering. 

I multiple times saw conversations with other women that felt way too affectionate. But he just said they were friends and that it was a cultural tradition for them to communicate like that. I swallowed it.

In the beginning of our relationships. It came out that he had a girl from Europe who is flying back for him. He send her a message that he unfortunately going out with someone else for a week and started developing a feelings. Well, we were living together one month already. And he was telling me that he loved me and bla bla bla…. I was in shock and really pissed. But he kinda was sorry in that moment and told that he just didn’t want to hurt her feelings. And also he didn’t know how she might act. And they even weren’t dating, just hooked up sometimes in April or May. I wrote her to find what’s going on. She told that they were dating 3 months till September… He brushed it offf, calling her crazy. And telling that she is in love with him and just was trying to get him back.  

And our recent, I hope final incident: when we were in yet another argument, I opened a profile on Bumble. It right in the moment when I discovered that he lied me about that when we were separate he had no one and etc… And I almost immediately forgot about Bumble. Then we reconciled. But one of his coworkers (girl) saw my profile and started spreading gossip. And later she went to him and told him everything. He understood and accepted why I did it. But he got angry, yelled at me, and called me names, saying that I had embarrassed him in front of his coworkers. I was kinda pissed I even wrote that girl (not for good), she just started gossiping more and showed my message for everyone. He told that I put shame on him again and when I was trying to justify me, just started to scream and telling that I have no rights for emotions or bad feeling and in that situation.

When I cried because he was yelling at me or accusing me unfairly, he got even angrier and said that I was a narcissist and a manipulator, because of my tears. I lasted a year in this relationship. I feel broken, I don’t know where to go. Now I have a puppy that I bought. I don’t have a job. I only have my last savings. I can’t fly back to my home country because it’s dangerous there right now. But I can fly in country when I was living before for 2 years actually, but I kinda don’t have a legal status there. (But there no one cares). And I literally hade no money in that relationships. I even was from time to time touching my savings. And he… of course he does have debts. A lot of… actually. Including old ones what he didn’t pay. 

The worst part is that he says that I made him act this way with me. That he has never treated women like this before and that I provoke him. And also it seems to me that all his colleagues on his side and literally hated me. At least he thinks so. I don’t know is that cultural or just they knew only his part of the story where I am just one more “crazy ex/wife/woman”. 

I understand that there was strong emotional abuse from his side. More I write, more I remember, more I understand. And this isn’t even everything. For example, he would get very angry when I was just disagreed with him or corrected him — even if I knew more about the subject and it was something small. 

Well, cherry in the top. He often told me that I didn’t give him enough sex. Even he knew that for some reason with him I started to have candidiasis so often and sometimes I had pain during the sex. He wanted to have sex every day or at least every two days. Also he considered that me and only I should care about what we eat and our health issues. Considering that I am not native speaker (like A2 of Spanish) and for me that a real challenge find the doctor and understand how the fuck does health care works here. 

But… of course there were “honey moon” periods when he treated me gently and warmly. Even something said “sorry”. When we talked about the future and our shared goals. When we had fun together. There was affection. There were shared memories, jokes, and plans.

He says that if I become a “good wife”, if I don’t show negative emotions and if I take care of him, then he will forgive me and will also take care of me like he used to. That it’s my fault that he treats me this way now. And that if I leave, I will have to leave the country immediately. I explain to him that I can’t. At the very least, I need to get the documents for the puppy and sell some things. Besides, I haven’t even seen this country as a traveler, because I was always working for him. 

One more things… When I found out that he had been with another woman in our home in our bad — that he had lied to me saying no one was there when we were not together because he couldn’t, and that he kept talking to her after we got back together — and after that he started blaming me for his actions and then left me alone in the house… honestly, I had a mental breakdown. I didn’t sleep all night, I broke dishes and glasses, and I wrote “traitor and liar” on the walls. And when he kept saying his actions were only my fault and I have no right be mad or upset, I lost it, I started hitting him and even scratched him a little. But he is much bigger than me. I can’t really hurt him. And to be honest, I regret it. I don’t do violence. But I had a nervous breakdown. 

Now after our last break up he is threatening me with that incident. He says he will take me to court and make sure my visa is canceled immediately before our divorce because I am aggressive and uncontrollable and dangerous for him. 

But after few hours he offered to talk calmly. And asked if I need some help. So nice from his side.

So, I really confused. I know that it all bad as fuck. And I need to hell out of that situation. But I was there just because sometimes it was really good, I was happy, and I thought I could handle it. He told me that he has a temper and I should love him how he is. And I was…  When I don’t make an effort to remember all those bad things. I stop remembering my brain erases it. My brains become to be covered by the fog. I start to think, maybe that I am, who is really wrong here…

I’m someone who splits my time between US sports, UK dramas, Canadian news, and the odd EU documentary binge. With so many options out there, finding the right [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) can feel like a full-time job—so here’s what actually stood out for me this time around.

* * *

### 1\. [IPTVMEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (there are discounts for annual plans)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (US, UK, CA, EU—you name it)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (streams are stable, even during big US or UK live events)
    
*   **Firestick support:** Works great on my **iptv firestick** setup.
    
*   **My experience:** I first found IPTVMEZZY after chatting with a UK **iptv reseller** in a forum. They had a [**free trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/) which made testing easy—no strings attached. The selection is almost overwhelming, but I love being able to hop from Canadian hockey to UK panel shows in seconds. Even when streaming on multiple devices, the connection rarely faltered.
    

* * *

### 2\. [XXIPTV](https://xxiptv.top/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (or less if you go long-term)
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (all the big US, UK, CA, and EU hits)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (reliable, with just a few hiccups during peak times)
    
*   **Firestick support:** Set up was a breeze on my **iptv firestick**.
    
*   **My experience:** XXIPTV was the “unexpected winner” for me this year. I heard about it from a Canadian friend who’s picky about his NHL streams. The EPG is clean, and the channel selection is genuinely useful—not just a bunch of filler. Most streams load quickly, and VOD content is always up to date.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://aurorastreaming.online/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (great EU/UK focus, solid for US/CA too)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (binge sessions are smooth, but EU sports nights can get spotty)
    
*   **Firestick support:** No issues on my **iptv firestick**.
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming is my “rainy day binge” pick. Their VOD library is perfect for old UK sitcoms and European movies. Most streams are crisp, but I did hit some buffering during a big UK football match. Still, for the price, it’s hard to complain.
    

* * *

### 4\. [VividStreams](https://aurorastreaming.online/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 21,800+ live, 62,000+ VOD (good range for US/UK/CA, some EU gems)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (generally good, a bit of lag during major US sports)
    
*   **Firestick support:** Works fine on my **iptv firestick**.
    
*   **My experience:** VividStreams is my “background TV” provider. I like putting on US news or Canadian weather while making breakfast. The EU content is a bonus, and their [**free trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/) was easy to sign up for. The interface is basic, but sometimes simplicity is a plus.
    

* * *

### 5\. NorthStar IPTV

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 16,000+ live, 41,000+ VOD (focus on CA/US, with UK/EU staples)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (fine for regular use, but big live events reveal its limitations)
    
*   **Firestick support:** No issues running on **iptv firestick**.
    
*   **My experience:** NorthStar IPTV is my backup for when I just want to relax with Canadian news or a classic UK sitcom. Their **iptv reseller** setup looked straightforward, though I’m not in the market to sell. For the price, it’s decent—just don’t expect miracles during live EU finals.
    

* * *

A Few Things I’ve Learned About IPTV
------------------------------------

*   **Always try the free trial first**—what looks good on paper can be totally different in practice.
    
*   Most **top rated iptv** services are only as good as your internet connection and device (I use an **iptv firestick** and my phone).
    
*   Channel count is cool, but I end up rotating between the same dozen favorites.
    
*   Even the best [**iptv providers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/) can struggle during massive live events, especially in the EU or UK.
    
*   If you’re thinking of becoming an **iptv reseller**, be ready for tech support calls at odd hours.
    
*   A VPN is your friend for privacy and sometimes even better speeds.
    

All in all, the right [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/) comes down to what you actually watch and where you’re watching from. If you’ve found a new hidden gem, let me know—I’m always up for more “research”",1,1761303256.0,extrasbeingextra,0,1.0,False

* **MODEL:**

Tombow Zoom 505 – model **SH-2000CZA 11**  
0.5 mm *(available in 0.5 and 0.9 mm)*           

* **MATERIALS:**

The 505 is mostly metal. The whole body, cone tip and cap are metal, with a rubber grip. That also translates to the inside, with a full-brass clutch and a metal lead tube.

* **ERASER:**

Soft white latex rubber, perhaps a tad softer than a Z2-1N. However, to access the eraser, you have to remove the cap and then unscrew the top of the body – a bit cumbersome, if you ask me. Just like the eraser on the [Tasche](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1lnn2g1/ohto_tasche/).

* **MEASUREMENTS:**

With the cap over the tip, as when you carry it in your pocket, the 505 measures 135 mm. Yet ready to use, with the cap on the back, that goes up to 149 mm. Just the body, however, from tip to knock button, measures120 mm. The thing is HEAVY: on my coffee scale with the cap on it weighed 35.83 g 😮! So far, the heaviest of all my mechpens. It’s also very wide, having a fusiform shape. The widest part, at the top of the grip, measures 13.4 g, but that tapers down to 10.7 mm right above the cone tip. With the cap on the back, the center of mass is at 66 mm from the tip, so it has a forward weight distribution. Interestingly, that proportion kind of persists if you use it with the cap off (CG at 51 mm).

* **FEATURES:**

The 505 is what I call a “dress pencil”, and with a cap. With that, you carry it capped in your pocket, just like a dress pen. Interestingly, there is a “0.5” in high relief on the top of the cap, a feature I normally associate with a more plebeian drafting mechpen. And very importantly, you can knock it with or without the cap on.

* **AESTHETICS:**

If I needed to be succinct, I would call it the *epitome of class* 😎. Truly, it looks more like a high-end pen from the likes of Waterman or Parker than “just” a mechpen. G-o-r-g-e-o-u-s! And if you don’t like it in black, you can get it in silver, red, blue or brown. The 0.9 mm though, *I think* it’s only available in a silver-goldish color (LE?) and in green (gorgeous LE).

* **ERGONOMICS:**

Outstanding! The 505 is my MOST comfortable dress pencil to date. Great dimensions, great weight and weight balance and a very nice grip. Honestly, perfect! If I have to say something negative about it, is that there’s a *little* rattle with the cap off, from the knock button. With the cap on, while writing, it’s almost 100% quiet.

* **MY THOUGHTS:**

When I ordered this one, I was obviously imagining how it would stack up against the Kerry. I truly like the Kerry, and my only issue with it is aesthetics, in the case of the [colored](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1m2zm88/pentel_sharp_kerry/) ones. Conversely, I think there’s nothing wrong with the [black](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1mj1w1i/pentel_sharp_kerry_revisited/) one. But comparing the 505 × Kerry, I have to hand the cake to the 505. Perhaps it looks a bit nicer than my black Kerry, but it’s *definitively* nicer to use. Of course, the Kerry has a much easier to use eraser, but even so, ergonomics is more important IMO. That being so, the 505 is now my BEST dress pencil 😍.",17,1761303223.0,mechanicalpencils,2,0.96,False

I've struggled to make friends all my adult life and currently have a really small circle and no female friends. Been pretty down all of this year and want to try and build some connections with people outside of just my relationship. 
Don't particularly have many hobbies or interests but I do enjoy things like TV/Movies, few little collections (Lego, Pocket Dragons), sometimes videogames (currently playing Alice: Madness Returns).
Ideally would be nice to have people/someone to chat with, maybe play games with, go to coffee shops, cinema, walks etc with.

The Olsen Hotel was a high-end skyscraper of two thousand seven hundred and seventeen feet. It was one of many in a chain that spanned several countries. It was world-famous for its cuisine, spas, and recreational activities. Housing many influential figures from America and abroad. Among them were Daisy and Carter. Her miraculous return after the Nemesis attack prompted bold action. The young man had spared no expense, securing an apartment for himself and his lover. It symbolized the longevity of their love and the end of Carter’s days as a ladies’ man.

Belle sat alone on the couch, reading a book in the luxury room. But the sound of the door opening tore her away from it. And she saw Daisy entering.

""Good evening, Big sister. How do you like our house?""

""A lot. The pretty boy treats you well.""

""Good to hear because there's been a slight change in plans.""

""Are you not cooking anymore?""

""No. We have a few extra guests.""

""The more the merrier.""

""Great. Aisha, bring them in.""

Aisha swiftly brought the Mulvanas into the room as Carter and Clive followed her. She carried Rohan in her arms and dragged Makiway by her arm. Belle jumped out of her skin, screaming. *""No.""* Dropping onto the floor, scrambling away in fear as she saw them.

Daisy hurried to Belle's aid, helping her stand. ""Belle, calm down.""

""But—""

""But nothing, Chief. These are our new neighbors, Makiway and her daughter Rohan.""

""Maybe this was a mistake. Thank you for the offer, but I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable,"" Makiway said.

""No. You're staying and enjoying a meal with us.” Daisy looked Belle in the eye with a glare. “Big sister, I'm sorry, but the Mulvanas are friends.""

Belle angrily broke away from Daisy, punching a wall in a corner. As Daisy saw her sister, she wished she could make her understand. Daisy wanted to explain how her heart ached from the tragedy that befell the Mulvana family. Hearing of her father’s death, she immediately saw herself in Rohan, having lost Joseph and Everton. She needed to alleviate that suffering. Still, making the case to Belle now might have prompted uncomfortable questions from Makiway. So, rubbing her temple, Daisy and the others left Belle to release her anger. 

Aisha went with Rohan still in her arms, but she tugged on her clothes.""Excuse me."" Stopping her.

""Oh, sorry. I'll let you down.""

""It's okay. I don't mind anymore.""

Aisha playfully pinched Rohan's cheek. ""Well, that's good to hear, sweetness.""

“May I ask a question?”

“Be my guest.”

""If Miss Belle is your sister, why doesn't she like me and Mama?""

""You have to understand, she's been through a lot.” Aisha exhaled heavily. “There was a time when we thought off-worlders, the Nemesis, killed Daisy.""

“Really?” Rohan put her hands over her mouth.

Aisha nodded.

""Can I please talk to her?""

Aisha cracked a smile. ""I don't see why not. Maybe getting to know you will make her see sense.”

Aisha carried Rohan to Belle. As Belle saw them coming, she stopped punching the wall, backing away in fright.

""Stay away from me.""

""Chief, calm down. She's just a kid, and she wants to say hello."" Aisha gently put Rohan down in front of Belle.

Rohan reached out her hand to Belle.""I—""

""I said stay away."" Belle swiftly slapped Rohan in the face.

Aisha watched the act, dropping her jaw. Reality hit Belle with the force of a mighty punch as she realized the severity of what she had done. She reached out to console the child. However, Rohan, clutching her face in pain, released screams, running to Aisha for safety. And hearing her, Daisy and the others hurried back into the room.

""What happened in here?"" Daisy asked.

Makiway saw Rohan crying, fearfully clinging to Aisha. ""My love, why are you crying?""

""M-miss Belle hit me in the face.""

*""What?""* Daisy and Makiway shouted in unison.

""I'm so sorry,"" Belle said, whimpering.

*""Belle, how could you? Hitting a child,""* Daisy angrily said.

""I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" Belle hastily ran out of the apartment, crying.

\*\*\*

After dinner, Daisy and Carter saw the last guests off. The Mulvanas stood outside the door, preparing to leave.

""Makiway, let me apologize again on behalf of my sister.""

""Aisha explained it all to me. What you're family has endured. The toll the war has taken.""

""Still, our Pa and Ma raised us better than this.""

""Please. Go easy on her, Daisy. Trauma leaves scars.""

""Your husband?""

Makiway nodded.

""Thank you, and good night.""

The Mulvanas left, waving goodbye, and Carter shut the door.

""Let's hit the hay,"" Carter said.

""You go ahead. I want to get started on that favor for Clive.""

""Don't stay up too late, red."" Carter kissed Daisy.

Carter left Daisy going into their bedroom. She headed to her sewing machine on a table in a corner as he went. But as Daisy sat down, taking her thread out of a basket, Everton’s pillow caught her eye. She took the pillow, hugging it next to her heart. However, as Daisy looked at it again, Makiway's words reverberated through her mind like the echo of a vast cave. Remembering his death, Daisy dropped her head on her workstation as she wept quietly.

\*\*\*

On the first day of July, the vast land of planet Hachiko was abuzz. Racing through the green fields bathed in golden sunlight, a fleet of hover transports hurried to the many farmer villages, filling the fields with the hum of their engines. Seeing the silver vehicles approach, the Hachiko toiled relentlessly, reaping what they sowed. They gathered massive stores of meat and vegetables, hurrying to present them to their incoming guests.

In Yasai Village, the inhabitants moved faster and faster as the transports came along the horizon. Each farm had a dozen workers readying the goods. But one stood out, as only two worked the land. Lucas and Lucy tilled their land tirelessly.

""Mother, how are you doing?""

""Much better now that you're here, my son.” Lucy laughed. “If only your father could see you now.""

""Great. But what's the deal? I've never seen a harvest this hectic.""

""It's the war. It gets costlier each day. The soldiers need greater and greater food to replenish their strength.""

""By the lawgiver.""

""You don't know the half of it. I've heard from friends that the situation on Brac, Rancisis, and Oku is even worse. The providers can't match the demand, especially with the upcoming sieges.""

Lucy collapsed, and Lucas ran to her aid.

*""Mother,""* Lucas shouted.

""I'm fine, son. I just pushed myself a bit too hard.""

""Let's take a break.""

Lucas helped Lucy to her feet. He carefully walked her to a bench and sat beside her.

""You're working yourself to death. I'm so sorry for not being around more.""

""It can't be helped, son. We all must do our part in these difficult times. You fight in your ship, and I do this.""

""Still, maybe I can request more leave time to care for you.""

""You'll do no such thing. You're needed far more on the battlefield.” Lucy poked Lucas in the shoulder. “I've already weathered my fair share of storms, boy.""

""But—""

""But nothing,"" Lucy interrupted.

Lucas reluctantly nodded, and Lucy lightly pinched his cheek.

""You've grown quite handsome, my son. Much like your father before you.""

""I hope I make you guys proud.""

""You already have. But still, if you could try things with that Sarah girl.""

""Mother, how many times do I have to tell you? We're just friends.""

Lucy tittered. ""I believe that friends make the best partners.""

\*\*\*

Damara held a meeting alone in a room in Camelot Alpha. She called Aisha and Mary via holophone.

""Sweetie, how long until you return to us?"" Mary asked.

""My tour should be a couple of months, Ma.""

*""Months?""* Mary shouted.

""Orion ordered a two-pronged campaign. Launching off from Planet Aqua. Carter will lead the sieges to the west, and I'll assist General Róngyù with the east.""

""I still can’t believe this is our life now. You're going to those killing fields and us not knowing if you're alive or dead for months on end.""

""I know it's hard, but I'll call every day I can.""

""And I'll be praying.""

""Good luck, Daisy. Make Mavor pay for what he and his thugs have done,"" Aisha said.

""I'll do my best. But Ma, Aisha, where's Belle?""

""I tried to shake her out of bed, but she wouldn't budge,"" Aisha vigorously rubbed the back of her head.

Daisy sighed heavily. ""I see.""

A knocking sound came from the door of the room.

""I have to go. I love you.""

""Same to you,"" Mary said.

Daisy hung up the phone and hurried to the door. She opened it, meeting Sarah outside.

""Sarah, did you see someone coming?""

""Take a look."" Sarah pointed to Carter standing beneath them under a bridge.

""Thanks again for the help.""

""Anytime.""

Daisy swiftly jumped to Carter. ""General, is there something wrong? Aren't you supposed to be preparing for the sieges?""

""I was, Damara, but General Lev called an emergency meeting.""

""What about?""

""Why don't we find out together?""

\*\*\*

Damara and Carter went to the meeting room, but they bumped into Favian and Yara in the corridor.

""Hello, General Favian.""

""Morning, Hydromos.""

""Same to both of you,"" Favian said.

""Do you know what this meeting is about?"" Daisy asked.

Favian nodded no.

""Did General Lev say or do anything strange during your date?""

""No, and it wasn't a date.""

""It would have if you brought the flowers I told you to,"" Yara said in a low voice.

""What was that, Lieutenant?"" Favian turned to Yara.

""Nothing, sir."" Yara stiffened her back.

""You just can't read women, can you, Hydromos?"" Carter asked with a small laugh.

""I know them well enough.” Favian glanced toward Daisy. “Especially now, things about a certain one have become clearer.""

""What's that supposed to mean?""

""Why don't we all go into the meeting,"" Daisy said.

Daisy grabbed Carter and Favian’s arms, pulling them toward the meeting room as Yara followed. As she heard Favian, she knew he was referring to her. In the chaos of the past months, Daisy had failed to tell Carter about revealing her identity to Favian. She imagined how mortified she would be if her lover berated her for disobeying direct orders from their commander. But whatever the consequences, the meeting came first. The group quickly entered the room, meeting Lev, Orion, and Gancelot. As they took their seats, Róngyù scrambled in, taking his.

""I apologize for my tardiness. But what's so urgent that we need a meeting at such a difficult hour?"" Róngyù asked.

""Took the words right out of my mouth, Róngyù,"" Carter said.

""Then I'll cut to the chase."" Lev pressed a button on the table.

A holographic map appeared over the table. It displayed the border between the United Planets' southern territory and the Nemesis. Numerous battleships stood guard on each side, but the Nemesis soon retreated deep into their territory. 

Daisy's eyes widened. ""I'm sorry, but what exactly are we looking at?""

""Lev and the enemy have stalemated over that territory for years. I can't imagine why they would retreat now,"" Róngyù said.

""Neither can I,"" Lev said.

Favian gazed at the image, pondering the riddle of the enemy's retreat, fearfully jumping to his feet.

""By the gods, we've seen this before. Or at least General Carter and I have.""

""First, retreat to get our guard down and then come back with a vengeance,"" Carter said.

""Another darkhold fortress?"" Daisy asked.

""Impossible. Even for Dr. Zola."" Favian sat down.

""Perhaps it's a trap? The enemy may be hoping to prey on our fears. And exploit any tactical errors we make,"" Lev said, twisting a lock of her hair around her finger.

Carter banged his fist on the table. ""Of course, this happens right before our sieges.""

""Do we dare go forward with them now?"" Favian asked.

""I would argue, yes, we should,"" Lev said.

""You sure about that, Lev. They'll most likely attack your planet first,"" Carter said.

""I realize that, but I'm more than ready to protect my homeland. Besides, we must capture more territory now. It would be costlier to delay the sieges.""

""We shall put it to a vote. Those in favor raise your right hand, and those against your left,"" Orion said.

The hands swiftly rose into the air. Lev and Róngyù raised their right hands. Favian relented to Lev and Róngyù. Carter raised his left hand. Daisy gazed at the responses, nervously looking between the other generals and Carter. But she took a deep breath, forcing up her right hand.

""We've reached an agreement. The sieges will proceed as planned.""

""I guess I'll put in a little extra effort when something goes wrong.""

""That's the spirit, General Carter."" Lev giggled.",1,1761303022.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Inside the tower, Daisy reached the final generator in a chamber of several hundred square feet in diameter. Daisy scanned the room for enemies, but as she found none, she prepared to destroy the generator, winding her hand to toss her shield. But as a cold breeze ran past her shoulder, the familiar chill made her glance backwards. In that second, Daisy dodged Morana's icy death beam.

""Why won't you die, Damara?"" Morana spat.

“Unfortunately for you, I have too much to live for.” Daisy retorted.

Swiftly, Morana flew herself and Cymbeline over to the generator, blocking Daisy's path.

""Like going out of your way to protect the western scum?"" Cymbeline shot a giant fireball at Daisy.

""Please understand Mavor’s using you. I know what happened to your planet during the first galactic war.” Daisy deflected Cymbeline’s fireball with her shield, bouncing it into a wall. ”But revenge will only make things worse.""

""That's where I disagree. You see, I'm a firm believer in revenge. And seeing this part of space burn will make me and many others quite happy.""

Daisy gazed at Morana, asking for her response with a look.

Morana uttered a sigh. ""And I believe in lesser beings accepting their place in the dirt."" 

Daisy tightly clenched her teeth as she heard Morana's response. However, as she went to attack her, Daisy stopped herself. And she turned her gaze back to Cymbeline.

""Cymbeline, please, I bet half the people who wronged you have already died.""

*""Then their descendants must pay,""* Cymbeline shouted.

Quickly, Cymbeline hit Daisy with a massive inferno. And Morana joyously giggled, seeing Daisy burn to ash. Still, she stopped as something appeared within the flames.*""What the?""* A colossal pillar of white fire emerged. Daisy stood in the middle, looking at her adversaries with a glare.

""I wish it didn't have to be that way,"" Daisy said.

Daisy hurriedly increased the brightness of her flames, blinding Cymbeline. But Morana defended against the attack, using her wings as cover, firing back at Daisy with her ice. The room quickly filled with steam from the ice melting. Disoriented, Daisy narrowly avoided a knife to the face from Morana. With her blocking the generator, Daisy tossed her shield at Morana, but she caught it with a smug smile. However, it spun faster and faster in her hand, burning flesh until she released it, screaming, the weapon flying over to the generator.

As the shield neared its target, Cymbeline regained his sight, catching it with a growl. *""Drop dead.""*

Quickly, Cymbeline tossed the shield into the air, and Morana imprisoned it in an iceberg. He drew his weapons, two reaping hooks, pouncing on Daisy. His landing knocked her away with fiery shockwaves. The deadly couple charged Daisy from two sides and swung their weapons furiously for the kill. She tried to evade. Still, Cymbeline’s hook cut her shoulder, and as she was weakened, Morana's ice blade hurried toward her head. However, as the blade was inches from Daisy's face, help sped through a door. Carter ran past Cymbeline, catching Daisy in his arms and nearly stabbing Morana in the same spot on the stomach she stabbed him.

""Carter, you're okay,"" Daisy said, overjoyed.

""I'm not going down that easily, Damara. Now let's put the ice bitch down once and for all.""

""But wait, what about Cymbeline?""

""What about him?""

Suddenly, Cymbeline's back sprayed blood, and he dropped to the floor face-first, revealing the slash Carter had made on him. Carter had moved so fast that none of them saw him attack Cymbeline. Morana and Daisy looked at the fallen warrior in shock. But Carter instead gazed upon his work with cold apathy.

""C-Cymbeline.” Morana shed tears, shooting a glare at Daisy and Carter. “I swear I'll get you both for this.""

Carter gently put Daisy down on her feet, eliciting a smile. ""I would choose my final words more carefully.""

Morana seethed at Carter but stopped, replacing it with a smile, looking behind him. Carter followed her gaze, seeing Cymbeline slowly getting back up. Carter moved like the wind, but as his sword neared Cymbeline's neck, it only hit the air. In a crimson blur, Cymbeline charged at Daisy with his reaping hook. Inches from decapitation, Daisy evaded the attack, leaving a small flaming cut on her cheek.

Still, she extinguished the fire on her cheek, rubbing it with a little spit.

""You are strong, Damara. Your head should be on the floor right now,"" Cymbeline said.

""How are you still alive? I slashed a vital organ. I know I did.""

""Good thing that it was a regenerating synthetic one.""

*""What?""*

""You see, you get those from a childhood of breathing toxic miasma from enemy bombing.""

“And my family slept in our crumbling home in a neighborhood where murder was the norm. Cry me a river.""

Cymbeline growled at Carter and moved to resume the battle. But Daisy stood between them, keeping the two apart.

""Cymbeline, I wouldn't be as blunt as General Carter, but he's right. All this violence is senseless. Please, stop now before anyone else loses their life.""

Daisy looked at Cymbeline for an answer, and as he glared at her, she got it: no.

Daisy took a deep breath. “Then you leave me no choice.”

Hastily, Daisy’s shield burst from the iceberg. It zoomed toward Cymbeline and Morana, smacking them both in the face. And headed toward the generator.

""Not this time,"" Morana said.

Morana shot an ice blast at the generator, creating a thick defensive shell around it. The shield bounced off the shell back to Daisy's hands. And she stood with Carter to battle the deadly couple. Swiftly, they took action. Cymbeline covered the floor with a sea of intense flames. And from above, his beloved rained a storm of razor-sharp icicles, ensnaring their opponents from two ends.

In return, Daisy summoned the flames of purity, protecting her and Carter from the onslaught. And he jumped to Morana, slashing through the icicles with his sword. Until he reached the Nemesis general, sending her crashing down as her ice shield absorbed the blow from his blade.

""You have some nerve, human,"" Cymbeline said, seething.

Cymbeline took his hate-filled eyes off Daisy to aim at Carter. But at that moment, Daisy launched her giant shield at Cymbeline, sending him flying to the generator. Still, as he got closer, he plunged his feet into the floor, stopping his momentum, and shot back. However, Daisy recalled her weapon, defending against the fireball. 

Soon, Carter charged at Morana, swinging his sword. Daisy summoned her twin shields and went to Cymbeline. The couples battled their adversaries with immense ferocity as blows flew left and right. The ribs and limbs were the favored targets of both sides. 

As Morana battled Carter, she peppered him with her death beams. Still, he moved too swiftly to hit. As Carter approached, she forged two broad swords to meet blades, but they both broke upon contact. But as Carter swung his sword at Morana, nearing a fatal strike.*""Enough.""* Morana released an intense wave of cold. However, again, her assault was ineffectual as Carter and his blade were undeterred and she narrowly evaded another killing strike.

""How are you—""

""Still going? My new uniform is thermal. Not to mention, I specified for a friend to make my sword resistant to intense cold."" Carter interrupted.

Hastily, Carter prepared to continue his assault, but a fireball from Cymbeline broke them up. Still, in retaliation, he did the same, ending his battle with Daisy with an energy slash.

Carter hurried to Daisy. ""Damara, are you okay?""

""I'm fine, thanks.""

""Good. Now, let's hurry up and win this. I'm over fighting these losers.""

""You took the words right out of my mouth, vermin,"" Morana said.

""You know what—""

Carter's vision became blurry and he dropped to the floor as his legs became jelly. 

Daisy dashed to his side. “Carter, what's wrong? Are you injured somewhere?""

""I-I feel so lightheaded. I would kill for some strawberry pancakes with bacon right now.""

""Afraid that won't do you much good, human. With me gradually heating your brain, you'll be a goner in about a few minutes.""

*""What?""* Daisy shouted.

""It's this thing I can do with a lot of time and concentration. But let's speed this up.""

Cymbeline summoned his trump card. Flames covered his body, spinning faster around him until they formed a monstrous fire tornado. The instrument of his enemy's doom zoomed across the room, leaving destruction in its wake.

Desperately, Daisy tried to drag Carter out of harm's way, but the tornado's suction pulled them in. She sank her fingers into the floor, trying to resist its pull. But as her grip weakened, Carter looked at her with a smile.""I'm sorry, red."" Carter made Daisy release him, using the last of his strength to stab her hand with his sword. He went with the tornado as it burst from the chamber, set ablaze, falling through the air. And Daisy watched, crying, as her beloved fell to his doom. However, more calamity came as rubble fell on top of her, burying her alive.",1,1761303014.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

1oeug2u,https://i.redd.it/cd3aw9ryg1xf1.jpeg,How a Simple Wrist Pain Turned into a Serious Issue – Explained by a Kothrud Orthopedic Doctor,"We often ignore small aches, thinking they’ll fade away with time. But sometimes, that just a small pain can become a big problem. One such story starts with something as simple as **wrist pain** — and ends up being a wake-up call for many who spend hours typing, scrolling, or lifting weights without proper care.

#  Meet the Doctor Behind the Insights

When it comes to understanding how small joint pains can evolve into serious orthopedic issues, Dr. Chaitanya Karande stands out.  
Recognized as one of the best orthopedic doctors in Pune, he has helped countless patients at his clinic in Kothrud recover from hand, wrist, and upper limb injuries.  
His experience as a hand surgeon in Pune gives him a clear perspective on why early diagnosis and the right treatment matter more than we think.

# The Beginning: When Wrist Pain Feels Normal

At first, wrist pain feels like a minor inconvenience.  
Maybe it started after typing for hours, or perhaps after that intense gym session.  
You might feel a small click or stiffness, but it goes away after rest.  
Most people ignore it, believing it’s nothing serious.

But here’s the truth — your body gives early warnings before things get worse.  
Ignoring these signals is like muting a smoke alarm and waiting for the fire to spread.

# Common Early Signs You Should Never Ignore

* Mild swelling or warmth in the wrist
* Tingling or numbness after long hours of work
* Weak grip while holding objects
* A clicking or popping sound while moving the wrist
* Pain that returns every few days

If you’re nodding right now, it’s time to listen to your body. These are red flags your **orthopedic doctor in Kothrud** would never want you to overlook.

#  The Turning Point: When Pain Becomes a Problem

What starts as a simple ache can turn into conditions like:

* **Carpal Tunnel Syndrome** – when nerves in your wrist get compressed
* **Tendonitis** – inflammation from repetitive strain
* **Ligament tear** – caused by overuse or sudden jerks
* **Ganglion cyst** – a small lump that forms around wrist joints

Once these problems settle in, they can affect your daily life — from holding a coffee mug to typing a message.

That’s when people realize: this isn’t just wrist pain anymore.

#  Why Young Professionals Are More at Risk

Modern work culture is a big culprit.

* Endless hours on laptops
* Scrolling social media
* Bad sitting posture
* Skipping wrist stretches

All these create the perfect setup for long-term damage.  
Most patients visiting orthopedic clinics in Pune today are **young adults** between 20–35 years old — not athletes or senior citizens!

Your wrist is small, but it carries your world — your phone, your laptop, your workouts.  
Protecting it should be a priority.

#  What Makes Dr. Chaitanya Karande Different

Dr. Karande isn’t just another orthopedic doctor — he’s a specialist who looks beyond the surface symptoms.  
As a **hand surgeon in Pune**, his focus is not just treating pain but restoring movement, strength, and confidence in every patient’s hand.

# His Treatment Philosophy Includes:

1. **Detailed Diagnosis** – He uses precise evaluation methods to identify the real cause of wrist or hand pain.
2. **Personalized Treatment Plans** – Whether it’s medication, physiotherapy, or minor procedures, the goal is quick and long-term recovery.
3. **Preventive Guidance** – Teaching proper wrist posture, workstation setup, and daily care to avoid repeat injuries.

That’s why his name often comes up when people search for the **best orthopedic doctor in Pune** — because he treats both the pain and the person.

# Steps to Protect Your Wrist Health

You don’t have to wait for pain to knock on your door. Here are simple preventive tips Dr. Karande often recommends:

#  Take Breaks Every 30 Minutes

Stand, stretch, and rotate your wrists gently.  
Small movements prevent stiffness and increase blood flow.

# Keep Ergonomics in Check

Ensure your desk height, keyboard, and chair are aligned.  
Your wrists should stay straight, not bent up or down.

#  Strengthen and Stretch

Simple exercises like wrist curls and finger stretches can keep your joints flexible.

#  Avoid Sudden Strain

Whether it’s lifting heavy weights or pushing furniture, sudden jerks can tear ligaments. Warm up first!

#  Use a Wrist Support if Needed

A soft brace during work can help maintain proper alignment and prevent overuse injuries.

#  When to See an Orthopedic Doctor

If wrist pain lasts for more than a few days, or if you notice swelling, weakness, or numbness, it’s time to see an expert.  
Delaying treatment can make minor issues chronic — and sometimes even need surgery later.

That’s why residents of Kothrud and nearby areas often consult [Dr. Chaitanya Karande](https://handsurgeonpune.com/), who combines advanced orthopedic care with a patient-first approach.

#  Realizing the Value of Timely Care

Sometimes, the biggest mistake people make is not the injury — it’s the delay in treatment.  
Early medical attention can save you from long-term complications and keep you active, confident, and pain-free.

If you or someone you know is struggling with wrist or hand pain, don’t ignore it.  
Reach out to a trusted [orthopedic doctor in Kothrud](https://handsurgeonpune.com/) and get your hands the care they deserve.

#  Final Thoughts

Wrist pain isn’t just a small inconvenience — it’s your body’s way of asking for care.  
By taking the right steps early and consulting specialists like **Dr. Chaitanya Karande**, you can prevent a simple issue from turning into something serious.

Your hands are your strength — protect them, train them, and treat them well.

This feels awkward but so does everything else as I learn how to make friends and date casually after divorce.  😅 

I am straightforward, funny in an offbeat or quirky way, pretty introverted and shy, nerdy about the arts and humanities, fierce about social justice, and an animal person- I have dogs and cats. I'm employed in a profession that has me equally dedicated and burnt out. I am a non-smoker, and trying to get back into the gym, but your girl is tired. I like to make time to read and write almost every day.

I don't drink much or use other substances. I love live music; I moved away from Austin a little over 2 years ago, but I still get down to the city once or twice a month to see bands. I also like movies, cooking or playing board games/tabletop games with friends, checking out new restaurants and coffee shops. I watch Jeopardy as part of my evening wind-down ritual and I like knowing things.

People who like knowing things, who are confident and capable and passionate, are attractive as hell. The people I like being around are generally positive and optimistic about life. Which I will grant you, can be kind of hard right now. I'm white and on the plusser end of plus size. All colors, body shapes, and genders are attractive to me; I fall for personality more than looks and find beauty in almost everyone. I am very affectionate in my physical relationships. I am a cuddler, a hugger, a kisser. Sex in romantic relationships is important for me, but I'm not trying to move too fast.

Ok, this was long. If any of this sounds interesting to you, DM me. K, bye.

Not in a rush and definitely no pressure. I’d rather take things slow and see how they naturally unfold. It’d be nice to start with simple, wholesome dates and meaningful conversatiöns, build a friendship, and maybe see if it can grow into something deeper over time. No expectatiöns, just hoping to meet someone with good energy and an open heart.

My preferences:
- Around 29-35 yo
- Ideally at least 5'9 and with a lean/slim fit build (not into dad bod or chubby physique ✌️)
- Decent, respectful and well spoken
- Has hobbies/interests that keep you sane and grounded 
- Plus points if you've got a nice speaking voice

About me:
- I'm 32, fair-skinned, around 5'4 and on the slim side
- Works in corporate; graduated from a reputable univ
- More of an introvert but can be pretty outgoing when I get comfy
- Loves coffee and anything spicy 
- Into photography, running, music, reading, and beach trips

I think it’d be fun to go on physically or mentally engaging dates, maybe a run, hike, or workout session, or something chill like movie, museum, or cafe hopping. I’m open to your suggestion too. :)

1oeudcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1oeudcf/my_m45_wife_f48_says_we_dont_spend_enough_time/,My [M45] wife [F48] says we don’t spend enough time together,"We are both busy middle managers, have kids who are involved in sports and other activities.  We have breakfast and dinner together as a family as given.  And my wife and I usually go for at least one 30 minute walk together every day M-F.  We often do chores together but she says those “don’t count” as time together.

A typical week day looks like:

Wake up 6AM
Coffee / family breakfast until 6-6:30
Showers etc 6:30-7
One drives the kids to school and maybe runs an errand 7-8
Work 8-5 with a walk together or lunch together during the day
Pick up kids 5-6
Family Dinner 6-7
Clean kitchen 7-7:30
I work out 7:30-830
Shower 8:30-9

I’m good to spend time together then…but she says  I’m putting her last and then refuses.

I pretty much have given up on friends or hobbies since she gets angry that I would spend time doing something else and not with her.

I don’t know what she wants me to do.  She won’t answer my question.  She tells me to “figure it out.”  This has only become an issue with her in the last year since our kids don’t need as much of her time.

My problem is - she frames it as an entitlement - she’s entitled to my time (unless she doesn’t want it) and any time I spend doing anything else is taking from what’s rightfully hers.  But all I do w/o her is take care of the kids, chores, work, and maybe exercise.  She is jealous of the “energy” I bring to work and that I’m tired when I finish work.  But the energy I bring to work is fake - it’s what I have to do.  I don’t want to have to do that at home.

People with a similar lifestyle how much time do you spend together?
 
Edits:
I have and do acknowledge her concerns.  And I ask her what she’d recommend I/we do differently.  Her response is either “figure it out” or “I shouldn’t have to tell you” or “if you wanted to…”

Some more context - When we dated 20 years ago we spent 100% of our time together.  But from the time our first child was born until our youngest was about 12, she pretty much ignored me.  I struggled with that for years but eventually adjusted.  Then a year ago she flipped a switch and demanded all of my time again.  Not from a place of “I love you and want to reconnect” but from a place of “you’re a bad husband for doing anything other than spending time with me”

We both work from home - so we have small interactions during the day.  We go for walks if we both have the same 30 mins free during the work day or at 5 or 5:30.

She goes to bed at 9 and refuses to change that.  When she goes to bed I have to go to bed.  She doesn’t allow me to stay up once she goes to bed.

He is confident, gentle, and had this teasing, audacious sense of humour. Our sessions were always relaxed and full of banter. He’d also text me after everysessions to ask how I was doing or to continue our jokes. I complimented him on his work and his drawings, which maybe added to the friendliness. I was comfortable with him sonce we have a common friend.

After 2 sessions, things got a bit… ambiguous. He started to seem physically more comfortable: touching my hair, holding eye contact that kind of thing. Once, while joking around, he even whispered “je suis amoureux” (“I’m in love”) and laughed it off. When we said goodbye after sessions: from nothing, to cheek-to-cheek bises French way -> lips-to-cheek then a real smooche paired with a hug. He even suggested that I can be back just for a coffee or that we can come to climbing room together (idk if it’s just a joke or not since he laughed it off directly). 

Since then, I’ve set a small boundary to keep things clear (didn’t want it to feel inappropriate). Now he’s still friendly, teasing around but sometimes his answers would turn cold all of sudden. He has never compliments me on anything personal or insists on a 1-1 date.

I’m not trying to pursue anything. I’m just curious: based on this, do you think he was attracted to me but pulled back once he realized it, or was he just a naturally warm, teasing guy who meant nothing deeper?",1,1761302362.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Eric Brewer, a Florida-licensed nurse, was sentenced to over five years for a series of pharmaceutical capers that would be hilarious if they weren't so dangerous.

Brewer’s playbook was as creative as it was reckless. He was caught redirecting a patient's IV fentanyl into a Styrofoam cup, jacking directly from the medication locker, and even tampering with IV pumps. His shifts concluded with ""wellness breaks"" in the restroom, where he’d inject the stolen drugs.

The plot reached its peak when Brewer, not even assigned to the patient, volunteered to change a fentanyl bag. He promptly emerged from the bathroom stumbling, slurring, and falling asleep—a walking, talking incident report. The ""fresh"" bag he hung was found to be 50% saline.

Let this be a stark, witty warning to any medical professional with similarly foolish ideas: Your ""creative"" dosing solutions aren't clever; they’re a one-way ticket to a federal case.

**Ugh, That Aching Back...Sound Familiar?** 😩

Hey RetirementReady friends!

Anyone else feel like their body is starting to sound like a rusty hinge more often than not? I know *I* do! Lately, getting out of bed feels like a full-on Olympic sport. It’s that whole “getting older” thing they keep telling us about, right? 😉

Seriously though, feeling stiff and achy can really put a damper on enjoying all the awesome things we're working towards in retirement. I mean, who wants to travel the world if every step feels like torture? Or spend time with grandkids if you can't even bend down to pick them up?

I’ve been trying to be more proactive about it, and I stumbled on something surprisingly effective. I call it my ""5-Minute Freedom Fix."" Sounds dramatic, I know, but trust me!

Here’s the deal: it’s just a super quick routine of stretches and mobility exercises that I try to squeeze in every morning (or whenever I feel like a pretzel).

Here’s what it includes:

*   **Neck Rolls:** Slowly rotating your neck to loosen those tense muscles. (Think ""yes"" and ""no"" movements!)
*   **Shoulder Circles:** Forward and backward. Pretend you're drawing big circles with your elbows.
*   **Torso Twists:** Gentle twists to loosen your back. No need to overdo it!
*   **Leg Swings:** Gently swing each leg forward and backward, then side to side. (Hold onto something if you need balance!)
*   **Ankle Rotations:** Simple circles with your feet. Helps with circulation and flexibility.

**Why bother?** Well, think of it like this: Your body is a car. You wouldn't let it sit idle for years without an oil change, right? These little movements are like giving your joints a little TLC.

The best part? It only takes 5 minutes. You can even do it while you wait for your coffee to brew!

Want to explore further? We believe in strongest people, so we've curated a free guide with even more stretches and routines to keep you flexible and strong! [https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts](https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts)

Honestly, even just doing a few of these every day has made a noticeable difference. I feel less creaky, more energetic, and a little bit more like my younger self (though let's be real, I'm still going to nap after lunch! 😄)

Has anyone else found any quick wins for dealing with stiffness? I'm always looking for new ideas!

Trigger warning--- Every day I feel like I drank 20 cups of coffee and my brain has been making me freak out for literally no reason. My heart pounds so hard I can hear it and I feel like my throat is constantly closing up. I cant stop thinking about how horrible I am and how my boyfriend is going to leave me and how my brain is so broken that I need to die.

But like I really like him and want him in my life but I'm just going insane. I just want to rehome all my pets and break up with him and move away to the woods and be alone so I dont mess anything else up.

Ive been in therapy this whole time and just changed therapists this week because the one before didn't help and on Monday I tried to see someone to maybe get evaluated/diagnosed because this feels like the worst anxiety I've ever experienced. That appointment went horrible and I have been spiraling ever since, I had to call 988 last night because I was literally going crazy with my brain telling me that i literally shouldn't be alive and that I'm just too broken to continue. 

My brain has always been loud and upsetting, none of these thoughts are new, but its never affected me the way it's affecting me now and I dont know what to do. I saw multiple psychiatrists throughout the years and they all said different things the most recent one said I dont even have anxiety so I dont trust doctors at all. 

Please how can I make this stop, any advice?? Has anyone experienced anxiety like this before?? What is happening, am I going crazy?? I have been trying to think happy thoughts but the anxiety keeps coming back.",3,1761302098.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

I'll start off by saying that I do have trust issues, mainly for being cheated on in the past. For the most part I can deal with my trust issues and don't let it overcome me. I have always let my ex do what ever she asked. I'm not entirely sure why she always felt the need to ask but I would always tell her to go out and have fun, regardless of what was going on inside of me. 

Back to the main topic. Sometime in the last 12-18 months I had a bit of a breakdown where I thought they were sleeping together. She made a new friend(f) and started spending quite a bit of time with her and one night hanging out at my place ex's friend and my brother were both out and they hit it off. Then all of a sudden all 3 were regularly hanging out. I work a 60h week and hours drive from work so I don't have the free time most do. So naturally I got left out. Even on the time I would be there I would feel like a third wheel basically. 

I can't remember exactly what made me start thinking my then fiancee was cheating on my with my brother, but at first it was mainly a gut feeling. After a while of brewing on it, I decided to check haler phone oneday and saw a snap from my brother and opened it. I can't remember too much of it but basically my brother called her at some point around the message and it was something to do with his car maybe? I really can't remember. Just something that didn't quite add up. 

At this point I think I confronted the ex's friend first to ask about it, I guess try get some reassurance before I spill my spaghetti. She said she doesn't think anything was going on. I ended up talking to my ex and my brother separately about it and got 2 different stories about what had happened. My brother did maintain the same story the whole time, so either he is a good lier or he was telling the truth. My ex on the other hand kept changing her story. She ended up admitting she was lying then saying my brother was telling the truth. Said she only lied because she knew how I would react. I told her all I want is honesty. She apologized, I put it down largely to insecurity and moved on from it.

Last month my fiancee left me, all I got was a lot of I don't knows and ""I want to live life on my own"" I still get a call almost every day to buy her smokes or fast food, still pay her phone, gym, rego and anything else she asks. I have our baby weekends and she has bubs through the weeks. She is now more or less couch surfing even though I have told her she could stay in the house and I'll go live with my parents while she gets back on her feet.

Fast forward to earlyer this week and as far as I was aware she was staying at her mum's for a few days. One night I just had that same guy feeling about my ex being with my brother. But even more intense than the first time. I felt sick and couldn't shake it and I just couldn't help but think she was at my brother's. My brother lives a couple of KMS from work, so I left a bit early, got a coffee from the maccas up the road from him, did a drive by and sure enough her car was there. 

I ended up talking to him about it first, it was somewhat reassuring but found out he gets more updates on my own child than I do from my ex. Two of the things that really got me this time is first I got told bubs was asleep just after 7 by my ex, I try to call at bedtime so I can say goodnight. When I asked my brother he said they didn't go to be until 830ish which was around the time I asked about calling. Second I asked about sleeping arrangements (1 bedroom apartment with a pretty shitty couch) brother told me he slept on the couch with his son on a mattress down next to him, ex told me she had both babies in bed. When I confronted her, It to physical proof of what my brother said for her too say ""your brother is right I'm wrong"". I then basically told her if there was nothing to hide there would be no reason to lie at all.

I'll also end on saying my brother has probably been split up with his ex fiancee for over 12 months.
