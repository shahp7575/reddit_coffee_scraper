It was never normally that obvious when I drank caffeine before, but because it was always higher, I suppose that was my body being used to it?

I've always had a higher resting heart rate since I was a kid, and now I'm wondering whether it's linked to caffeine... Perhaps I'll cut it out completely.

For the past 2 weeks I’ve been waking up around **3:30–4:00 AM**, which is **30–60 minutes before my actual alarm (4:40 AM)**, and I just **can’t fall back asleep**.

This started after a stressful driving exam. Since then my sleep feels “stuck” in this early-wake pattern.

Some quick details:

* Bedtime: 9–11 PM
* I don’t nap during the day
* I drink 1 coffees only in the morning
* Sometimes I wake up because I need to pee, but the real problem is that I **stay awake**
* I often wake up clear-headed but unable to drift back
* Started taking **1 mg melatonin** at night
* Light evening exercise (short run / walk)
* Afternoons are very sleepy (dark November weather)

I can function during the day, just tired.

**My questions:**

1. Is this normal after stress?
2. Why can’t I fall back asleep at all?
3. Is this just a temporary circadian shift?
4. What can I do to fix it?

Thanks for any advice.",1,1764073285.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

Hoping you can help me ratify my decision over which is the right steam deck model for me.

I was about to pull the trigger and buy the OLED 512gb model for myself. Then the black friday sale was launched and the LCD model is down to about £270-280 in the UK.

I plan to use the steam deck mainly to play games through my steam library that are not open world, as I have a semi decent PC for those. So things like Hollow knight, ori, maybe dispatch, things of that nature.

I also plan to mainly use it indoors, so I can chill out and game on the sofa instead, maybe at the coffee shop.

So this got me thinking, do I really need the OLED or will the LCD be the right choice for me?",0,1764073219.0,SteamDeck,4,0.17,False

This week, the week before Thanksgiving, I have been writing about being grateful.
If you follow me, you know I am not a believer in ""days"" to do certain things, and this is definitely one of them.

So today, the day of Thanksgiving I ask you, why can't we be grateful every day? Why is there one specific day that we must do it on. It is way too much pressure to be perfect, to come together and for many to pretend we like each other. 

Come on, let's be real here. We all have that one relative that just gets under your skin. That has asked you for years why you're still single or why you haven't lost weight and you're trying to swallow your turkey and keep that fake smile on your face while you're doing it.
Or that one cousin that is always bragging about what they have, always trying to make you feel like a loser. Yes, one day a year puts too much pressure on people to have to pretend that they are grateful.

I am grateful each and every day, but it hasn't always been this way. I had to teach myself this. I had to actually dig and find things to be grateful for as I was in such a miserable place in my life. I remember when Oprah started her gratitude journal, and she wanted all her viewers to do this as well. I thought I'd try, but there was nothing besides my girls that I was grateful for. Yes, it was that bad, so I started with the basics that most of us already have.

I was grateful that I woke up.
I was grateful for a home.
I was grateful for having food.
I was grateful for a car.
I was grateful for my and my girl's health.
I was grateful I could walk.
I was grateful I could see.

Look, I was really reaching here because there wasn't much else I was grateful for.
But each week, I added something, like being grateful for a walk on the ocean. Seeing birds in the sky, a warm cup of coffee on a chilly day, and before I knew it, I started being grateful for everything. 
Every morning on the way to work, I give thanks for the life I have now. I cry because I am so grateful. 

Being grateful opens you up to other blessings, and it's not just me saying this. ""In positive psychology research, gratitude is strongly and consistently associated with greater happiness. Gratitude helps people feel more positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships, "" says Harvard Health.

Even scientists know this is a real thing, that having gratitude changes your life. So then, why do we only have one day to be grateful? A day that is so stressful for so many to have everything perfect, to come together with relatives you don't like, with people that drink too much or never shut up and now you want us to be grateful? It seems so phony to me. I don't care about Thanksgiving, in fact when the girls were young and I was divorced I did Thanksgiving on Friday so they could spend the actual day with their dad and didn't have to feel like they had to pick or be without the other parent. 

Did it matter that it wasn't on Thanksgiving for me? No, I was grateful for having dinner with my girls and my friends every single time we sat at my table. And so if it wasn't on Thanksgiving, what did that mean? That I wasn't as grateful? No, because having to do something and wanting to do something are two very different things.
I chose to be thankful, not just on Thanksgiving when they tell us, too, but every day. Sometimes, every moment because I know how precious life truly is these last few years.

So today, my friends remember we don't need a day to remind us to be grateful. We need a life to do that, a life that we are grateful for at all times, a life that we take nothing for granted and no matter what happens we can always find something to be grateful for.

Two people who basically “head” the team are kind of strict or at least project that kind of aura.

But here’s the part that’s really throwing me off: one of the heads refuses to have in-person conversations or meetings.

The agent pulls up our file and calmly tells me that apparently our region got reclassified into a higher risk tier after some statewide data update. Which is funny becuz nothing around us changed except a coffee shop closing. It felt surreal hearing someone tell me our daily life is now considered riskier even though it looks exactly the same. I asked what exactly triggered the jump and he kind of admitted they dont really explain the formula to staff either. Just that the system recalculated and here we are.



What really got me was realizing how little control we have over these constant small financial jolts. Not catastrophes but the random 100 here 200 there that stack up without warning. We can afford it, sure, but it still feels like playing a game where the rules quietly shift every few months.

Nov. 6th, 1983

7:24 A.M.

I don’t notice my eyes drifting closed until the radar jolts me awake again.

“Sixty-eight miles per hour.”

A red sports bike drifts into the horizon. I give it no more attention than a sigh. I’m not awake enough to chase down some kid going thirteen over. Not that I’d even catch him. We have a no-chase policy—specifically for those types of bikes. It gets too dangerous for civilians if they decide to run.

Anyone reading this would probably think I’m one of those lazy cops. Not the case. It’s just a rough morning. The warm cup of coffee in my lap is too soothing, begging me to lean back and close my eyes.

But I’m disrupted again.

Another cruiser pulls up beside my window and gives me a courtesy blip of the siren.

I lift my head to see Marco leaning over his steering wheel, trying to get my attention. I roll the window down, ready for a round of shit-talking. Instead, he looks confused.

“Hey, you get a call on the handset?”

I look down at the carphone. The LED is still solid red.

“Nothing. Why?”

“They been telling us to go set up at Wexler Labs. Full roadblock, I guess.”

“Hm. I haven’t heard—”

I’m cut off by the walkie on my chest crackling to life with Susan’s voice:

“All units, please be advised. Ten-thirty-three at Wexler Ave. Intersection 143 to be closed down. You’ll receive a call if you’re actively needed at the scene. All other units return to the precinct ASAP.”

I glance at Marco. He shrugs.

“Fuckin’ weird,” he mutters. “Well, sounds like I’m going to set up. I’ll find out what I can.” He starts to pull away.

“By the way, I wasn’t sleeping! Just closed my eyes!” I shout.

He waves a hand dismissively.

The last time we were all called back to the precinct was during the flood, when we had to work with the National Guard. With how quiet the morning’s been, I get a strange feeling.

I buckle up and whip a U-turn.

A fire truck with sirens blazing tears past me in the opposite lane, heading toward Marco. Probably a multi-car accident, I think. But then more lights follow. Fire truck. Ambulance. Another ambulance.

Then something stranger—

A line of large black SUVs. Windows tinted. Government-looking.

“The fuck?”

I turn my head as they pass, trying to catch markings. Nothing.

I grab the handset and call in. The line barely rings.

“Dispatch.”

“Susan, it’s James. What the hell’s going on?”

“Uhm… uh—”

She sounds like she’s juggling paperwork. Phones ring nonstop behind her.

“I’m sorry, James. I’m not really sure. You should be heading back to the office.”

“Yeah, I heard. I am. So was there a big accident or something?”

“I really can’t say. I don’t know either. Just taking orders. Head back and they’ll fill you in.”

The precinct comes into view, surrounded by squad cars. I get out in step with another officer—a new guy I’ve seen around.

“Hey, pretty interesting first week, eh?” I say.

“Yeah, not so bad. You know what this is about?” His voice is young. Reminds me of my boy.

“You know as much as I do, bud. Probably a safety briefing or something,” I reassure him.

Inside, the stuffy, brightly lit room looks thrown together, with chairs still stacked along the walls. Everyone packs in tight, the air buzzing with low murmuring.

A head pops up near the front—Commissioner Harrison. I hear his voice before I see him. He’s standing on a chair.

“Listen up! Everyone who isn’t here is responding to the traffic block at Wexler Ave. We’re also working with other officials to block off the Wexler Corporation property.”

A voice from the back calls out, “This a terrorist attack?”

A few chuckles.

“No! Nobody’s saying that right now. Now listen. We’ve been tasked with setting up a perimeter within a ten-mile radius of the Wexler site. That means evacuating every single person in that radius.”

The crowd groans.

“This is a big operation, I understand. Lincoln Park, Mathers, and other high schools have provided buses that are currently en route and ready for passengers.”

Another voice shouts:

“Where are we gonna put all these people? You’re talking thousands.”

The room erupts in uneasy conversation. Harrison raises his voice.

“There is a designated receiving point already being set up. Now, I don’t know what the situation is, but it’s enough of a concern that the National Guard has been deployed. We’ll be working around the clock with neighboring counties.”

Unease twists in my stomach. If it’s not a terrorist attack, then it feels like something worse.

The rookie next to me folds his arms, looking like a lost puppy.

“Form lines at the front and grab a packet. The post-it color tells you your group. Times, locations, instructions—all inside. Report to your commanding officer at your site.”

We shuffle forward as confusion grows and the promise of a long night settles in.

“So, anything I should load in my cruiser?” the rookie asks.

“Make sure your traffic-safety stuff’s in there. Other than that, couldn’t tell ya.”

I watch the stack of packets shrink. Then it hits me like a gut punch—

my house.

It’s in the ten-mile radius.

I push forward, grab two packets, hand one to the rookie.

“Let’s go,” I say.

We head out into city streets now flooded with sirens.

I pack my things into my car and see the rookie nervously flipping through his packet. I pause before shutting my door.

“Hey—get in. You’re with me.”

He looks relieved and hurries into the passenger seat.

“You sure I’m supposed to ride with you?”

I pull a cigarette from my breast pocket and stick it between my lips.

“Your packet’s got a green stamp, right?”

He rifles through the papers.

“Uh… yeah. Yeah, it does.”

“Okay, so you’re with me.”

I slam the car into reverse and peel out. The rookie grabs the ceiling handle.

“Where are we going?” he asks, fumbling with his seatbelt.

“My family. We live on Jackson. Gonna make sure my wife gets out.”

“Okay, but aren’t we supposed to go—”

I cut him off.

“You ask too many questions. Just keep up.”

“Got it,” he snaps back.

With sirens blazing, we race down the street, dodging traffic and cutting corners.

I pick up the handset and dial home.

The phone rings too long.

“C’mon, Cheryl. Pick up.”

“You’ve reached the Nolan residence. Sorry, we’re—”

I slam the phone down.

“Fuck,” I mutter.

Evacuees fill the sidewalks. Luggage dragging behind them like it’s an airport on Thanksgiving.

Rookie stares into the dash, pale.

“You good?” I ask.

“My brother. Eddie. He works night shift at Wexler. He’s there right now.”

The dread in his voice hits me. I’ve never been one to offer false comfort—but I do it anyway.

“After I get my wife, we’ll go for your brother. Understand?”

He nods.

Jackson Street is lined with school buses. Families spill out of houses, kids still in pajamas. I spot my wife’s car.

“Wait here,” I tell Rookie, jumping out.

Cheryl meets me at the door the second I touch the knob.

“Honey!”

Inside, grocery sacks sit piled in the hallway.

“Where’re the kids?”

“Upstairs getting dressed. James, can you tell me what the hell is happening?”

“I don’t know. Something at Wexler. They’re evacuating ten miles.”

“Jesus… Are we safe?”

“Cheryl, I don’t know.” I yell upstairs: “Coats! Let’s go, move!”

In the closet I grab the old nine-millimeter and shove it into a bag with ammo.

“What the hell is that for?” she asks.

“Precaution. You know how to use it.”

Rookie bursts through the door.

“Nolan!” he shouts.

I turn. “What?”

“They got synthetics on the streets. People are gettin’ rowdy.”

I push past him to the doorway. White trucks unload S.H.R reps. A man shoves one.

“Get your fuckin’ hands off me, meat bag!”

Crowds yell as they’re corralled toward buses.

One of the synths turns toward our house and starts up the steps, moving stiff and casual at the same time.

I block the doorway. “Fuck off. Police business!”

She doesn’t react.

“Cheryl Nolan and family must proceed to Bus Three at this time.”

I get in her face. “She’s not going anywhere. I’m handling this as a Cook County officer—”

“James,” she interrupts flatly, “I must urge you to follow protocols.”

I slam the door. Her shadow stays behind the hazy glass.

“What the shit?” one of the kids whispers.

“Language.”

I grab Cheryl’s arm gently. “If they’re using S.H.R reps, it means they’re not willing to put real people out here.”

“What does that mean?” she asks, voice shaking.

“Means they don’t think it’s safe.”

We slip out the back. Kids stumble with their bags, hair messy from sleep. In the garage, the station wagon waits. I grip Cheryl’s shoulders.

“Go north. To my parents. Don’t stop for anyone.”

Her eyes well.

“James…”

I kiss her forehead and breathe in the familiar scent of her perfume.

“We’re gonna be fine. Take care of them. I’ll call when I can.” I say.

Rookie loads the last bags and looks to me. 

“Go with them.  I’ll find Eddie.  I’ll make sure he gets out.”  Another promise I wasn’t sure I could fulfill.  He stared at me for a moment, but then quickly followed as he slid into the passenger seat. 

I kneel by the back window and take my daughter’s hand. I smile, then look to her brother.

“You take care of your sister, Morgan.”

He nods, serious.

I meet Rookie’s eyes again as mine say: Don’t fuck up.

He gives a stiff, silent nod.

I watch the wagon roll down the alley until exhaust swallows it.  I’m left with the echoes of chaos and sirens all around me.

It’s now booked for 20/3 (I was hoping for sooner but surgeon won’t do it before then because of major surgery & general anaesthetic.) when I came home from hysterectomy I was too tired & hungry - sleeping in a ward with 3 other people & having nurses coming round every 4 hours to do blood pressure, temperature I didn’t really sleep & the food was SO bad I didn’t eat (I had a sandwich - basically 1 piece of ham on bread with probably no butter which they keep in fridges so are freezing cold). I was in hospital 2 nights so really did need to eat, drink & sleep. I sat down on the recliner & hubby brought me a lovely cup of coffee & some lovely buttered toast then I just dozed. Even though it’s a different ward I’m going to the same hospital so expecting the same - no sleep & awful food (par for the course nowadays in UK NHS hospitals) so this time I’m going to make sure to eat more before I go in & take an eye mask.

1p6ad77,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1p6ad77/understanding_sweetness_on_for_my_recipes/,Understanding sweetness on for my recipes.,"Understanding sweetness on for my recipes. 

Just a quick background, I started brewing pourovers in June, I got a V60 Drip-in as a gift from my girlfriend and I have a Kingrinder K2, the first cup that I brew was super floral, literally taste like Jasmine Tea (the coffee its self says it has Jasmine Tea taste notes). The recipe I followed (butchered actually since it was my first time) is Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6. Ever since then I've been brewing with that recipe, my cups has been filled with decent acidity and medium to strong bitterness which I assume is from the fines generated by my K2. Then few weeks ago I got K-Ultra as an upgrade, with it I feel like I understand what a ""balanced"" cup means my brews have been good, decent acidity, decent body, with low to medium bitterness. But what I feel like lacking in my brew is sweetness. I've been brewing with this recipe :



Most of my coffee are light roast with Fruity notes.

Between 5.3 and 6.5 clicks in K-Ultra

15g coffee

250g total water

1st pour 50g - low agitation 

2nd pour 100g - Aggressive Pour - Swirl at the end

3rd pour 50g - low agitation 

4th pour 50g - low agitation 



The way I came up with this is because I want to combine the simplicity of Hoffman's recipe (just pouring with equal blocks) and Tetsu Kasuya's control. So instead of doing 5 equal pours, I chose to put that one block of 50 grams into the second pour instead to mimic Tetsu Kasuya's recipe and get more sweetness in my cup. But so far that has not been the case. I feel like most of my brews has been similar in taste, medium body, decent acidity, low to medium bitterness and the flavor notes would be sometimes be SO subtle. I was hoping I could make my cup more sweeter to accentuate those flavor notes more and make my cups distinctive for each bag of beans. Any tips on how should I approach this? Should I change the recipe completely? Maybe grind coarser? Or maybe just find a way to refine my palette(I'm thinking maybe the sweetness is actually there and I just can't perceive it lol) ? Any tips would be appreciated!

* **Idea 1:** Provide sketches with accurate dimensions. It's easier to communicate 3D designs this way. Your doodles don't have to be aesthetically pleasing, but should be easily readable.
* **Idea 2:** Be prepared to answer a lot of questions about your design. The less data you'll provide in your initial post, the more questions you will have to answer later. Preferably get a measuring tool (a ruler, a caliper) to be able to take accurate measurements.
* **Idea 3:** Be reasonable setting the reward. Remember the last cup of coffee you got from a fancy coffee shop and ask yourself, what kind of work would you be willing to do for this cup.
* **Idea 4:** Stop using AI to save some time on typing even if English is not your native language. Reading well-formatted but ""taste-less"" generic AI-slop is no fun.
* **Idea 5:** We all do/say/think stupid things sometimes. If somebody pointed out that your recent suggestion was not necessarily smart: learn from it or ignore it instead of being offended.

Bonus idea for the fellow tinkerers and designers: if you can't compete on price, compete on quality.",1,1764070769.0,u_georgmierau,0,1.0,False

To keep things kinda short about our story and what happened- My now BF (25M) cheated on me (26F) during our “situationship” building phase. We weren’t “official” but we were building on being official due to my trust issues. 

We were friends for a year in the same friend group 2020- Then exes of an almost 3 year relationship 2021-2023. We broke up due to immaturity, mainly on my part I was young and do admit I’d get a bit toxic and jealous. A year later we both grew and healed and I broke no contact in January of this year. 

However in the beginning I said I wanted to work on building trust first I said I didn’t want a relationship yet. But we were exclusive to only each other. We agreed that if there were others we’d tell each other INSTANTLY. (I know stupid. Very stupid but too late now and I’ve learned my lesson) Let’s just say time flew by super super fast and we hadn’t had a conversation about being “official” since.. I thought it was obvious by all the dates, family events, work events, everything we did together that I was ready, he thought the ball was in my court to say something so he was waiting almost this entire year to the point he felt we were stagnant and not getting anywhere.. yep our communication wasn’t great.. (I know STUPID. Hopefully this is a lesson for others to never put yourself in a situationship knowing you have feelings) 

Then came the night.. he had a one night stand with a coworker at his place whom he invited. He Instantly called me after and said he needed to talk. He called out of work the next morning and came over to my place and told me everything on his own he showed me all the messages and everything. Even some details that I shouldn’t have asked he still answered. He said it was the most stupid choice of his life he hates that he hurt me like this and he hates that he cheated on me. he doesn’t wanna make any excuses. He wish he could go back in time and pull himself out of lust he said. It did take a bit to get the “why” out of him, because he felt saying anything  like that makes it seem like he’s making excuses for what he did and he really didn’t wanna make it look like what he chose to do was excusable he said. 

His “why” is pretty much he felt we were stuck in this gray area and I was never gonna be ready to be official with him.. but he also expressed that he terribly messed up and should’ve communicated with me first which that I agree. 

I will say I had no clue at all at the time I was super blindsided and never would’ve thought he would sleep with another girl. This man just got done surprising me for my bday and called my mom for help on my bday. And he took me on the most beautiful date that was soo fun he planned most of it even surprised me with flowers and coffee… 

The entire almost 6 years I’ve known this guy he has never slept with another girl I know this 100%. Even when we were broken up he never slept with another, so this is SUPER out of character. He really is my bestfriend and I know him.. I know he hasn’t so this really shocked me and hurt so badly. The girl he slept with she was in it for sex only she didn’t want anything else but supposedly she softly knew he had a girl he was in a situation with.. that bothers me a bit too like she knew a little about me and still went forward with it like what the heck..

Now it’s been a month and we instantly said we will work on healing TOGETHER this time, we are official now. He said he will do the work and everything in his power to prove to me that he wants me and what he did wasn’t who he was it was a bad choice. And I know some might think it’s not smart being this young but I really do love him and I can feel he loves me. I do believe he just made a bad choice without communication. I’ve given a pass because I Was the ONE who said NO to being official in the beginning and I also could’ve communicated my side too. I’m not blaming I’m just saying there’s two sides to a situation. And honestly this situation woke me up that what the heck was I doing? I want him so why didn’t I say commit earlier…

Anyway Now the Main question I’m asking is-

Are these good healing signs? I am feeling happy, I do still get some waves.. but there is still a little side of me that now, I know he’s capable of sleeping with another, especially before he communicates.. maybe he could do it again you know? But I also know that’s just the trauma speaking, but I also just wanna make sure these are good signs:

Everytime a wave hits and I cry- he comforts me, holds me, kisses me (within my comfort) reassures me, communicates how he loves me and compliments me a lot, he says things like “you’re safe I’m not going anywhere” “spiral in my arms I got you, I’m sorry for giving you this pain the least I can do is help you through it” 

If I do ever spiral or get in waves and he’s not around or at work I will text him and he will instantly text me back with reassurances, asking what specifically it is what the trigger is and what I need, or if he is available he will call me and talk me through the waves. Not all the time but at first sometimes he would cry too but now a lot of the times he holds back because he says it’s not about him it just hurts him to see what he did to me. I feel guilty as I can tell when my waves do hit I can see it in his eyes that it breaks him and he gets a bit depressed. but now my waves aren’t as bad anymore, I used to have them real bad everyday but within a month later I don’t get them as badly.. the waves are random but everytime I feel a trigger I will tell him and he has been trying to help me identify and work through the triggers together. One time in the first week my wave was soo bad I was having a panic attack and he called out of work and came over with a coffee and held me and talked me through it and also put on my favorite show.  

He messages me with transparency a lot during work, home, anywhere, he’ll tell me and show me what he’s doing, with, who and where. He even offered and downloaded life360 to share his location when he can’t text me cause he said he wants me to trust and feel safe with him again, and he wants to prove to me that he’d never do that again because he never wants to hurt me or see me like this. He texts, calls or FaceTimes me every chance he gets. He sleeps on call or we sleep at each others houses (he’s been sleeping at my house a lot because I’ve been wanting him and he wants me to be happy he said) 

He deleted her off everything, and has a new position in his job (yes it’s real his sister works with him now as it’s her position) so he works in a different spot he won’t ever see that girl. He called her (I wasn’t able to hear the full conversation but I was there just in a different room to give privacy) and he apologized what he did to the girl and she said she’s in her own situation in love with somebody else and also wants to delete him off everything which they both did including blocking. and if there ever is a work even shes mention in he shows me instantly which has only happened once but it was just emails nothing more.  

He has planned a date almost every other weekend with me (within my comfort) and still talks about future plans. he has been helping me clean my place, he keeps giving me motivation to not stay home and not cry, to be happy and he keeps telling me what he did doesn’t define who I am, I am enough, and he’s always telling me how beautiful i am. He wants to do weekly check ins we talk about how I’m feeling with healing. 

he said whatever I want to do that will help me trust him and feel safe with him again he will do- wether it’s getting cameras, anything on his phone, computer etc- grab it whenever i wanna look I don’t have to ask (he’s never cared before if i went through his stuff but I always asked this time he’s saying don’t ask but I still do) 

And tonight he cooked me steak cut my steak up, and watched a tv show with me and was yapping with me the entire time. I feel super happy. I’m still slightly scared obviously. 

I’ve also been working on giving him reassurance too that even if I get waves he hasn’t done anything it’s just my trauma reacting, and I always thank him and compliment him and show him love and gratitude when he helps me. Cause I know healing is gonna be on both sides and he deserves to know his work is helping. Even if a wave happens. 

We talk and text like bestfriends still, we send silly memes and stuff still, I feel like our communication is WAY stronger for some reason? We’re talking and having fun alot lately. He’s coming to my family’s thanksgiving and I’m starting to slowly, SLOWLY forget the pain a little bit which is weird it’s happening so early on?..

But I am becoming extremely happy, I’m healing honestly way more that he’s around helping me, and I do feel if he wasn’t here helping I probably wouldn’t be as happy so fast and I don’t know why I do but I just feel that way. 



TL;DR:
Ex-turned-BF (25M) cheated on me (26F) with a coworker during a situationship where we were exclusive but not officially “boyfriend/girlfriend.” He told me on his own immediately, showed the messages, and is extremely remorseful. Since then he’s been very transparent (location shared, open phone/computer), comforting me through panic attacks and waves, planning dates, being consistent, and actively working on my trust and our communication. My waves are less intense and I feel happier with him around, but I’m still scared because I now know he is capable of cheating. Are these genuinely good signs of healing and change, or am I just trauma-bonded/hopeful?",1,1764070651.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,2,1.0,False

Every request, every plan, every favor. I thought being agreeable would make people like me more.

Instead, I lost myself completely and watched my relationships fall apart one by one.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about people pleasing that nobody talks about:

You become invisible .When you never have opinions, preferences, or boundaries, people forget you exist. You're just the person who goes along with whatever. There's nothing interesting or memorable about you.

People lose respect for you. Deep down, everyone knows when someone has no backbone. They might use your niceness, but they don't respect it. Respect comes from knowing you'll stand up for what matters to you.

You attract the wrong people. Users, manipulators, and selfish people LOVE people pleasers. They can sense you won't say no. Meanwhile, healthy people get uncomfortable around someone with zero boundaries.

Your relationships become one-sided. You give everything, they take everything. Then you get resentful because ""you do so much for them"" but they never reciprocate. But you never asked them to—you just assumed they should.

Nobody knows the real you. How can someone love you if you never show them who you actually are? You're so busy being what you think they want that your real personality disappears.

You become exhausted and bitter. Saying yes when you mean no is emotionally draining. Eventually, you start resenting everyone for ""making"" you do things you chose to do.

How to break the cycle:

Start saying no to small things ""I can't grab coffee today"" or ""That movie isn't really my thing."" Practice with low-stakes situations first.

Express actual preferences like ""I'd prefer pizza over sushi"" or ""I'm not really into horror movies."" Let people know you have opinions.

Set tiny boundaries ""I don't check work emails after 8PM"" or ""I need 30 minutes to myself when I get home."" Start small and build up.

Stop apologizing for having needs ""I need to leave by 9"" not ""Sorry, I'm so lame but I have to leave early."" Your needs aren't an apology.

Some people will get upset when you stop people pleasing. Good. Those are the people who were only around because you were convenient.

The right people will respect you more for having boundaries. And you'll finally have space for relationships where you can be yourself.

Healthy relationships need two whole people, not one person and their shadow. That's my hard realization after years of people pleasing.",23,1764070132.0,howtonotgiveafuck,1,0.96,False

As i get older and older, i have less and less friends. Most of the people i used to hangout with online are the same age as me, and now have kids/spouses and in general a lot more going on in life then me. So i'm mostly just hanging out with myself! Which kinda sucks, tbh. So i'm just on the lookout for anyone that values spending time together, online. I miss sitting in calls, talking about whatever, watching stuff together on either discord screenshare, or plex. And just playing games in general. I have a ton of games, and i would love to play more. I'm not gonnas list any games since that's not the purpose of this post. This post is more to find someone that i can vibe with, someone i get along with. But it would be very good if you  played games.

But i'm gonna list some favorites of different kinds, so you somewhat get a feel for who i am?

* The movie Oldboy, been my favorite since it came out, so good.
* Bread. I do love bread, any type of bread tbh, it's not good for you but could easily live on it.
* Pepsi Max/Water/Coffee. I almost exclusively drink these 3 things.
* I do listen to a lot of music, but it's hard to describe? so heres my [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/zauron)
* Animals! An easy thing to love. I sadly don't have a cat anymore, but i'll adopt one soon again. I'm also very into Capybaras, they are amazing!
* Homelabbing. I have a \*erver which i tinker with a lot, running a bunch of services and just playing around with it, it's super fun!

That's some stuff atleast. I'm also kinda introverted, and my energy fluctuate quite a bit, so if i don't respond, don't take it personal!

Oh, and i'm located in Sweden. But any TZ is fine really, my sleep scheduele is all over the place!

relationships are doing more for their referrals than any paid marketing ever has.

That’s a big reason we started the **SIS “Just Networking”** meetups every Tuesday morning. No pitches, no pressure — just senior-care businesses getting in the same room, sharing resources, and connecting with the people who actually make things happen:  
home health, hospice, hospitals, IPRs, care homes, assisted living/ALs, memory care teams, LTCi agents, Medicaid specialists, and local service providers.

Most weeks we’ve got 30–50 pros from all across Central Texas, and the mix is always different. Some folks come to find partners, some come to stay visible, some just come to drink coffee and swap stories before starting their day.

If you’re a healthcare business, service provider, or senior-care professional anywhere along the I-35 corridor, what kind of networking or collaboration actually helps you grow?  
And if you haven’t been to a SIS event yet — what would make it valuable for you?

1p6a0df,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6a0df,Magnifica Evo milk issues,"Hello fellow coffee lovers,
I recently bought a dehlonghi magnifica evo and have been enjoying it untill recently when the milk stopped foaming. It still produces hot milk but does not foam whatsoever. 

I've seen similar post on here which suggested people were not fully disassembling the milk carafe before cleaning and some components were caked in built up milk but this has not been the case for me. The carafe and all components has always been kept very clean (See photo of usual problem component).
I've also done the usual descaling process with De'Longhi branded descaler and fitted a new water filter but it's made no difference.
I saw another post were somebody suggested running water through the milk carafe instead of milk, I've don't this three times and again no joy.

De'Longhi seem impossible to contact for support, I've filled the form in on the website twice and not had a response, the phone number also automatically hangs up before connecting.

All I can think of next is buying an entire new milk carafe in the hope that this solves the issue, but as the machine is only 3 months old it's not something I think I should need to do.

Any advice? Anyone had similar?

1p69qwv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p69qwv,I saw this in my dream and thought it would make a good fangame.,"Basically the game took place in some sort of cheap office building. I dont really remember lore or anything but i know the animatronics were in bad shape so lets say its a company that holds onto the broken animatronics until repair company comes and takes them.

Basically i was sitting at that blue dot. On a long desk facing the wall. Right next to me was a female-like AI secretary or something. 

Here's how it worked:

\* Bonnie only attacked from the vent and there was no way of locking the vent in any way. He made some indicator sounds 30 seconds before point of no return. But Bonnie only attacked if either Chika or Freddy were on the move. If you failed to put a stop to Bonnie, the vent would open but he would only be able to attack you if you were close to the vent (where your desk and secretary is) and it was more like a gamble.

\* The secretary was constantly on the computer and was keeping you company. I think she was able to take control over 2 animatronics which would halt their movements until she stopped. She would get hacked/possesed occasionally and when that happened you were pretty much defenseless besides the office door. Though the secretary would only get hacked if you werent at your desk and the duration of her being hacked would affect the time it took to restart her. Aside from the control mechanic she was the one who told you how much power you had left and gave you heads ups if an animatronic was not on its destined spot but was also not visible in the cameras.

\*I dont remember much about that sleeping animatronic besides the fact that his room was connected to an important room you had to go to once-twice a night and you'd have to be very quiet. Also he wouldnt leave the room.

\*Freddy had no quirk to him here. He was just a basic obstacle.

\*After Chika left her room she would either approach your office or roam the first floor. If she was on the first floor she would occasionally make scary loud chicken noises and wake up the sleeping animatronic if you were in his room.

\*Foxy was pretty basic too. Except he only had one attack. The secretary didnt have control over foxy too. He would only attack if you were SEATED at your desk. He'd make it to your office in like 5-6 seconds which is barely enough for you to get up and close the door.

\*There was this energy system. The boss's room had a coffee maker where you could restore most of your energy. Your speed was standart while you were seeing/hearing an animatronic, but your energy affected your speed while there were no animatronics in sight/the sounds they made were subtle.

\*The power room worked as you all might think. Though here you only lost a fix amount of power for opening/closing the door and not lost it depending on the duration. The secretary on base level didnt cost power, but controlling animatronics did.



Generally the gameplay was kind of complicated. It wasnt like in usual fnaf games where every animatronic was a direct threat. Here it was more like Chika and Freddy opened the way for Bonnie and Foxy to attack you. If you put down Bonnie then you'd have to deal with foxy and viseversa. Freddy was the most passive animatronic here, even Chika was a bigger threat.

Idk i just thought the vibe was very new and different and a breath of fresh air. Im not like the biggest fan of fnaf. Especially after security breach. But its such a big part of my childhood that it still sometimes makes it to my dreams lol.",1,1764068942.0,fivenightsatfreddys,0,1.0,False

I'm no coffee afficionado or connossieur, but I find it really weird that almost nowhere but the most specialist independent coffee shops offers *any* kind of choice in the coffee they serve.

My partner and I both really dislike acidic, citrusy coffee and much prefer a darker, more chocolatey roast. She drinks it black so really tastes it and in particular finds that it gets increasingly unpalatable as it cools; I have milk and a tangy coffee definitely doesn't work well with that. As I see it, this is the fundamental divide in coffee flavour profiles, and the fact that it isn't more common to at least be offered a choice between those two seems like a restaurant just having *wine*, with no choice even between red or white. And I swear there are probably more restaurants that have a *water* sommelier than offer you a choice even between two roasts for your after-dinner coffee. Furthermore, there is no advertisement of an establishment's chosen style, so you have to just go and try it for yourself, often leading to an unsatisfying morning coffee when you're away from home.

If a place is using an espresso machine they can put whatever coffee is needed in for each brew, so all that would be required is for a 2nd grinder, which doesn't seem like too much of a burden to be able to get customers a lot closer to drinking the coffee they enjoy.

As I said, I'm not even a coffee enthusiast and this irritates me; is this something that others find strange or irritating? Is there maybe a reason why almost no businesses cater to what I have to assume is not a particularly obscure consumer desire?

So i keep 3 types of honey at home, Rowse that i use instead of sugar in basically everything from cooking to coffee, its my all around sweetener. then Raw honey i use to eat cold on occasion but mostly for ferments as it has active microbes eg yeast that are necessary for fermentation, then finally I have a MGO 260+ and UMF 10+ manuka honey that i only use cold as is, for eg in yoghurt or on desserts 

I'm looking at making a few things from ice cream to chocolate and wonder, if i use raw honey, will it effect the shelf life? I've avoided unpasturised honey to date for cooking and food prep for this reason but perhaps its unnecessary? i know honey itself is antimicrobial to an extent but struggling to find a clear answer, all honey comparisons seem to be around their flavour profile or benefits, though nobody is really looking at thermal degradation effects

Am I being a shitty person? 

We’ve had issues for a while, mostly due to mental load and exhaustion. I do around 80% of house/kids/car related jobs/admin. I also work full time. 

I have tried in many ways to tell him that I need help for a while now. I get met with well I put the bins out. Which yes he does and I say thank you for that or on occasion when he makes food I’ll say thank you for that. However every other thing is me. 

He said I am a mother what should I expect, this is what all mums do. And I am trying to make him my bitch and I should be grateful for the things he does. 

I am emotionally checking out, I have a lot to say but I don’t want to because no matter how I approach it he gets mad, defensive and starts shouting in my face. In every recent argument, he’s told me we’re getting a divorce because he’s sick of me, he’s going to take me back to my parents and most recently threatened to hit me. 

He spins everything I have said or done. Example - whilst on maternity leave with a 3 year old and a baby I said to my mum oh can’t wait to go back to work I’ll be able to have a warm cup of coffee for once. He was there and agreed. He called my dad over few months ago, and said to him I don’t want to look after my children amongst another 50 things…

Other things, he’ll say I have a shitty job or to his manager recently with me in the room he said I could be doing nothing and still earn more than her. Yes I earn slightly less than him but why disrespect me and be little me in-front of your manager? 

The most recent threat to hit me came of the back of my eldest being ill. I am currently sleeping with both of the boys and he sleeps on his own in our bedroom as he had back surgery. This specific situation was 2 weeks post op and he came in angry 
Telling me to take our 1 year old into his room, I was trying to settle them back down as my eldest woke up crying. He was so insistent and was about to pick him up when he’s been told not to lift, bend etc I said how are you going to look after him, he said bring him to the other room you psycho before I back hand you. And he continued with the insults. 

Prior to the above, I was doing everything… putting his clothes on, bathing him, bringing him food, water everything. Whilst working and looking after the boys. Doing nursery/school drop offs and logging back into work till 1am to catch up. I was physically exhausted and he would ask for a foot massage whilst I was feeling like this. 

I had issues with his personal hygiene which I have brought up multiple times, which he has started to make slight changes. He wouldn’t brush his teeth, wouldn’t change his tshirt - will sleep wake up three days in a row with the same tshirt. This has been happening for years. I will have to tell him to shower or change before we leave for anywhere. He will sit even when working with his hands down his pants constantly. And when laying down. Up until now I have bought everything for him, toothbrush, boxers, clothes everything. Takes no responsibility over his own things. 

He is constantly on his phone, every minute he spends on his phone or watching something. Even with the boys around after school nursery, he will just put the tv on and he will lay on his phone. Lack of presence around his own children. 

He won’t make any sort of plans at all - it always has to be me. Taking the boys out, birthdays, holidays etc everything has to be me. 

When he comes to intimacy/sex he thinks he will just say do you want to have sex. That’s it, the sex isn’t bad. It’s just the nature of it being a bit of just what he wants. There is no intimacy during the day no effort what’s so ever. Couple of months ago we had an argument about the above he ended it with we’ll sell the house and get a divorce, 3 days later he basically says can we fuck. 

Above are just a few examples, but there is a million and I could be here all day. My thing right now is, basically I’m sick of it! I only speak to him when I have to mostly relating to the boys. Am I being a dick for not speaking to him? Am I being worse than him? I don’t want to speak to him and argue because I know he will spin everything on me. No way am I the perfect person, yes I am moody and get pissed off quickly, because I feel so unseen in this whole relationship. Being a mother to a fully grown adult man. I don’t want to say help me I want him to help. 

I’ve been literally questioning my own existence, thinking about what I would write to my boys if I chose to end it all. I find myself crying, when I have a moment to myself. ",1,1764068604.0,NarcissisticSpouses,1,1.0,False

I’m struggling with some analysis paralysis. 

I was pretty set on a Eureka Libra 65 AP, but then I started wondering if it’s a Jack of all trades/master of none - partly evidenced by the slow grind times. I mostly drink espresso.

So now I’m looking at the new Mazzer Mini G for £1000 or the Eureka Atom 65 W for £1100.

Im looking for: GbW, hopper, espresso

It’s my first grinder, so part of me is telling me to stop being mental and go cheaper. In which case the Eureka Libra 55 looks good. Thing is, if it’s going to last me 10+ years, I’d rather get something at the top of my budget.

TL;DR: should I buy the Mazzer Mini G or Eureka Atom 65 W?

Any opinions are greatly appreciated - thank you!

I randomly got hayfever when I was mid 20s and lived with that for a long time till about 10-12 years ago when I was treated for a deviated septum to help clear things up. post surgery my smell never came back.. spoke to the doctors, had tests etc and was told sorry you’re one of those random people who a septoplasty causes loss of smell. sorry about that.

  
So have spent a good ten years plus with no smell and resigned myself to whelp, is what it is.

  
i don’t really know much about polyps but went back through the NhS in the UK and asked to be referred and guess what — oh yeah your nose is full of polyps and all sorts of other stuff “debris - nice” in your sinus cavities.  had cameras up my nose, MRI, CT scan etc and yep - well that all needs clearing out.  consultants were 50/50 on if I’d get my smell back, they were saying I probably had long term nerve damage so it was unlikely. 

  
3 weeks ago I had FESS surgery and about a week ago I was doing something random and was hang on.. did I just smell washing powder/detergent?? I stuffed my head in the box and could definitely get a vague sense.  

  
we have a coffee machine and I know coffee beans are a good indicator so went and gave that a good sniff and holy shit - I mean it didn’t smell exactly like coffee more like burnt dirt but it was something!

  
not gonna lie, I cried like an absolute baby.

  
so 3 weeks post FESS and things are trickling back. coffee is super strong, detergents and harsh stuff like paint I’ve got, the more subtle smells I know will take longer so am doing a twice daily smell routine plus nasal rinses twice a day too.

  
so really just a positive tale and to say dont give up hope.  my mri and ct was a way better indicator of the debris blockages way further up that I think cameras couldn’t really see, so push for those if you can!",2,1764067357.0,NasalPolyps,0,1.0,False

First up, breakfast - lightly warmed bread which was probably toasted over the lukewarm contents of someone’s commode. Stone cold by the time it reached my plate. Accompanied by soggy Weetabix and a glass of orange juice because apparently fruit is too much of a luxury. 1/10


Snack was a cold cup of instant coffee and a rubbery chunk of cheese with dry crackers despite dairy being something that continues to upset my stomach and cheese being a strong dislike. Seasoned liberally with Mrs Dash that I snuck in to give some flavour to the misery of these meals. 0/10

Dinner - a cold vegan sausage that managed to maintain the consistency of being both under cooked and rock hard. Boiled broccoli that melted in the mouth to a fine mush for those of us on the ward who have no teeth left to chew, I assume. Potato cubes which were apparently given the misleading misnomer of ‘herby’ whilst eliciting precisely no reaction from the tastebuds.

Another dinner - ‘chicken’ arrabbiata which quite possibly could have been horse meat. Arrived in an industrial sized microwaveable container despite the temperature suggesting it had never been placed anywhere near anything warm. The meat managed to be both rubbery and unchewable while the pasta had the consistency of pate.  At least there was a vegetable in there. Two whole carrot slices. Side of peas that were once again boiled into a flavourless, nutritionless garnish. 3/10

Dinner again - the same miserable arriabbata but with no vegetables or nutrition. There may be an outbreak of scurvy on the ward soon. 2.5/10

Another dinner - beef curry which lacked any of the traditional seasoning or spices that would allow it to be called curry under the trade descriptions act. In this instance it seemed more like cat food with meat so solid you would need titanium teeth to masticate. Rice that was once again cold but left so long on the tray that it was rock solid and inseparable. Green beans I had to beg for which were the texture of a fine purée. 2/10

The issue is that every motor etc. seems to be working fine, but when you brew a cup of coffee for example, no water comes out of the coffee nozzle. Water heats up, coffee grinds fine but the water simply ends up in the bottom tray as if there is a block/huge leak inside the machine. If I do a few attempts, maybe a little comes out in the cup but usually close to nothing at all. The left nozzle for hot water/milk foamer works perfectly fine.   
  
I've cleaned the brewing unit thoroughly including disassembling the little round metal plate which tends to clog with ground coffeee, and I've and attempted without the water filter with no luck either. Seen a few repair videos, but couldn't really find any other things to try. It seems like there is either a blockage further inside the machine or maybe the brewing unit isn't engaging properly with the water nozzle. 

I was considering the gaskets as they do seem to be an issue for some, but I assume those would mostly result in minor leaks and not downright pouring most (if not all) water down the tray - after all 200ml of water in half a minute is quite a lot, so that's why I was thinking more of a straight up block or leak.

  
Here is a video taken seconds after a cup has finished brewing, with the brewing unit removed - as you can see, the hot water is lying in the tray below and a lot of dripping from the water nozzle: [https://streamable.com/6to782](https://streamable.com/6to782)

But is that actually true? Let's cut through the marketing hype and give you a straight answer.

**The short answer:** No, you don't technically need a VPN to perform the jailbreaking process itself. However, you *should* strongly consider using one afterward if you plan to use third-party streaming apps. The distinction matters, and understanding why will help you make an informed decision about your streaming setup.

In this guide, we'll explain what ""jailbreaking"" actually means, when a VPN becomes important, what the real risks are, and how to protect yourself if you decide to proceed.



# What Does ""Jailbreaking a Firestick"" Actually Mean?

Let's start by clearing up a major misconception: ""jailbreaking"" a Firestick isn't really jailbreaking at all. Unlike jailbreaking an iPhone or rooting an Android device, you're not making any complicated system-level changes or modifying core files.

What people call ""jailbreaking"" is actually just tweaking a few settings to remove Amazon's restrictions so you can install unauthorized apps. The technical term is **sideloading** — installing apps from sources other than the official Amazon App Store.

Here's what the process involves:

1. **Enabling Developer Options** in your Firestick settings
2. **Allowing installation from unknown sources**
3. **Using the Downloader app** (available in Amazon's store) to install third-party apps like Kodi

This process is straightforward overall and won't cause any device issues because you're just enabling developer options on a device you own. The term ""jailbreak"" has stuck around because it sounds more dramatic and has become the popular terminology, even though it's technically inaccurate.

# Do You Need a VPN to Jailbreak Your Firestick?

**Technical answer: Absolutely not.**

You don't need to use a VPN when you jailbreak your Firestick. The jailbreaking process itself:

* Doesn't require an internet connection (beyond downloading the Downloader app initially)
* Only involves changing settings in your device menu
* Doesn't transmit any data that needs encryption
* Takes about 5 minutes and happens entirely on your device

You could disconnect your Firestick from WiFi completely and still complete the ""jailbreaking"" steps. No VPN needed, no privacy concerns during the process itself.

# Do You Need a VPN AFTER Jailbreaking? Here's Where It Gets Important

Now we get to the real question. Once your Firestick is jailbroken and you start installing third-party apps, it might be a good idea to use a VPN after you jailbreak your device and while using third-party apps to stream content or access the web.

Here's why a VPN becomes relevant:

# 1. ISP Monitoring and Tracking

Your Internet Service Provider can see everything you stream. ISP monitoring detects pirate streams, with 78% of warnings coming this way. When you access streaming apps — especially those offering ""free"" copyrighted content — your ISP knows exactly what you're doing.

Everything you stream online is visible to your ISP and the government. While they may not actively monitor every user 24/7, they have the capability and increasingly the motivation to do so, especially as copyright holders pressure them to take action.

# 2. ISP Throttling

Streaming eats up massive amounts of data, and if your streaming comes to their notice, ISPs will intentionally throttle or slow down your network because they know the amount of data it consumes. This causes buffering, reduced quality, and a frustrating viewing experience.

A VPN encrypts your traffic, preventing your ISP from seeing specifically what you're streaming, which can help avoid targeted throttling.

# 3. Security Vulnerabilities

Unverified apps may contain malware, errors, and glitches that could harm your device or subscribe you to services without your permission. While a VPN doesn't directly protect against malware, it adds a layer of privacy that can help limit exposure if a malicious app is trying to collect your data.

Around two in five illegal streamers have fallen prey to fraud, likely linked to compromised hardware or the risky apps and websites that come with illegal streaming.

# 4. Legal Exposure (This Is the Big One)

If you're streaming geo-restricted content or any free content that is otherwise available for a hefty price, then that's where VPN matters. Let's be very clear about this: **using a VPN doesn't make streaming copyrighted content legal**. However, it does add a layer of privacy that makes it harder to track your activities.

# The Legal Landscape in 2025: What You Need to Know

Here's where things get serious. The legal environment around jailbroken Firesticks has changed significantly, and enforcement is increasing.

# Jailbreaking Itself Is Legal

A jailbroken Fire Stick is absolutely legal because you are only sideloading apps of your choice — as the owner of the device, you can download any app that you like. It is legal because you own the device and are simply modifying the settings that Amazon provides, and it does not void your device's warranty.

# But What You Do With It Might Not Be

Jailbreaking a Fire Stick is only legal as long as you are not doing anything illegal. The problems arise when people use jailbroken devices to access copyrighted content without permission.

# Recent Enforcement Actions in 2025

The authorities are getting more aggressive:

* In the last week of October 2025, police raided four properties and arrested four men in West Yorkshire for copyright and money-laundering offences, suspected of running an operation with a six-figure turnover that sold hacked Amazon Fire Sticks
* Very few individual users have faced legal action for the personal use of illegal streaming services, but most cases involve either selling devices or operating commercial streaming services
* Authorities are now conducting ""Knock and Talk"" visits on suspects, suggesting they're expanding their reach

# Who's Really at Risk?

Internet service providers and government agencies do monitor illegal streaming, but their approach focuses on major distributors rather than individual users. However:

* Some users report receiving DMCA notices from their internet providers for accessing copyrighted content — these typically result in warnings rather than legal action, but repeated violations can lead to service termination
* Documented cases prove people have gotten in trouble—especially sellers and heavy commercial users

The bottom line: If you're just a casual user, prosecution is unlikely but not impossible. If you're selling ""fully loaded"" Firesticks or running a commercial operation, you're at serious legal risk.



# What a VPN Actually Does (And Doesn't Do)

Let's be realistic about VPN capabilities:

# What a VPN DOES Protect:

1. **Hides your streaming activity from your ISP** — A VPN encodes all your data, so your ISP cannot see what you are streaming
2. **Prevents bandwidth throttling** — A VPN would secure your traffic and prevent your internet service provider from throttling your speeds
3. **Encrypts your connection** — Especially important on public WiFi
4. **Bypasses geo-restrictions** — Allows access to content not available in your region

# What a VPN DOESN'T Do:

1. **Make piracy legal** — Using a VPN to stream copyrighted content is still illegal, just harder to trace
2. **Protect against malware** — If you install a malicious app, a VPN won't stop it from harming your device
3. **Guarantee complete anonymity** — VPN providers can still see your traffic unless they have a genuine no-logs policy
4. **Prevent all legal consequences** — If authorities really want to find you, a VPN just makes it harder, not impossible



# When You MUST Have a VPN

Consider a VPN essential if you:

1. **Plan to access geo-restricted content** — Even legitimate content that's just not available in your country
2. **Use public WiFi frequently** — Coffee shops, airports, hotels
3. **Stream copyrighted content** (though we strongly advise against this)
4. **Want to avoid ISP throttling** during heavy streaming sessions



# When You Probably Don't Need a VPN

You can skip the VPN if you:

1. **Only use official Amazon App Store apps** — Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Disney+, etc.
2. **Only stream free, legal content** — Pluto TV, Tubi, YouTube
3. **Do casual browsing and shopping**
4. **Aren't accessing geo-restricted content**

If government surveillance, hackers, web spies, monitoring of online activities, ISP throttling, censorship, and breach of privacy do not concern you, you do not need a VPN for FireStick.

# Best Practices for Jailbroken Firesticks

If you decide to proceed with a jailbroken Firestick, here's how to minimize risks:

1. **Use a reputable VPN with a no-logs policy** if you're streaming third-party content
2. **Stick to legal streaming apps** whenever possible — they're often better quality anyway
3. **Keep your device updated** with the latest Fire OS software
4. **Research apps before installing** — Check reviews and sources
5. **Don't publicly share your setup** on social media or forums
6. **Consider legal alternatives** — Several FireStick VPNs, including ExpressVPN, IPVanish, and Private Internet Access (PIA), can help you access geo-restricted content, and many legitimate streaming services are very affordable
7. **Never buy pre-loaded ""fully loaded"" Firesticks** — Sellers face criminal charges, and buyers get scammed with malware



# VPN Recommendations (For Legitimate Use)

If you've decided you need a VPN for privacy, geo-unblocking, or security reasons, the documents reference several reputable options:

* **ExpressVPN** — Frequently cited for speed and security
* **NordVPN** — Known for large server network
* **Surfshark** — Budget-friendly with unlimited connections
* **CyberGhost** — Beginner-friendly interface

**Important disclaimer:** We're not promoting VPNs as tools for piracy. These services have legitimate uses including privacy protection, secure browsing on public networks, and accessing content you legally own while traveling.

Most free VPNs make a profit by selling user data to third parties, so if you're going to use one, invest in a reputable paid service.

# The Bottom Line

**Do you need a VPN to jailbreak a Firestick?** No. The jailbreaking process itself requires no VPN.

**Should you use a VPN after jailbreaking?** It depends on what you plan to do:

* **For legal streaming of geo-restricted content you own:** Yes, a VPN is useful
* **For privacy and avoiding ISP throttling:** Yes, a VPN helps
* **For accessing copyrighted content illegally:** A VPN reduces risk but doesn't eliminate it — and we don't recommend this approach
* **For casual use of official apps:** No, a VPN isn't necessary

The safest and most legal approach? Use your jailbroken Firestick for legitimate apps like Kodi with legal add-ons, region-appropriate streaming services, and free, legal content platforms. The small cost of legitimate streaming services is far less than the potential legal fees, device replacement costs, and stress of worrying about enforcement actions.

Make your decision with full awareness of both the capabilities and limitations of VPNs, and the genuine legal risks involved in streaming copyrighted content — VPN or not.
