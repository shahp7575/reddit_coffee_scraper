I had PPA and had this underlying feeling something was ‘wrong’ all the time. I could never quite put my finger on it. I just always felt like I was searching for something in my son I couldn’t quite grasp. Not that it was missing, but that I couldn’t quite get to it. And I really wanted and craved this thing, whatever it was. I was so attached to him, and I felt he was so attached to me. But I was looking for something from him he couldn’t quite give me? It’s really weird to type it out but that’s how it felt.

We started baby classes and I noticed other babies were a lot more interested in me than my own. They were a lot more expressive too. I briefly mentioned this, but everyone said “oh don’t be silly”. You just think that because of PPA. And I did feel silly for saying it, and so guilty too.

Over this time I started therapy, medication, counselling but the feeling never went away. I just sort of started to made my peace with it. 

Then we met up with a friend for coffee whose baby was a bit younger. Her baby looked at me. Like, REALLY looked at me. It felt like into my soul! I genuinely think I might have gasped. It was only on the way home I thought “SHIT, that’s what it is”. 

My son had never really looked at me. Like, properly looked. That’s why I had PPA! I didn’t just think that because I had anxiety, I had anxiety because of that! 

He has grown into the most loving, fun, sweet little boy. He still doesn’t really ‘look’ at me, but now sometimes I do catch a little fleeting glimpse of what I remember always searching for and it is just the most amazing thing.",1,1762052957.0,Autism_Parenting,0,1.0,False

​Hey everyone, and a huge welcome to the place where we acknowledge that sometimes, life is just a series of unexpected haymakers!
​This is your new favorite spot for the moment when you stop, look around at the chaos, and realize all you can do is either cry... or make a meme out of it. We're here for both.
​What is a ""Life Hit""?
​A ""hit"" is any moment that forces you to pause, adapt, or change direction. It can be:
​The Gut Punch: A major life event like a layoff, a sudden breakup, a big diagnosis, or a shocking repair bill.
​The Absurd Misstep: A small, embarrassing disaster, like spilling coffee on your only suit right before a presentation, or accidentally sending that private text to your whole family group chat.
​The Triumph: The moment you picked yourself back up, learned a hard lesson, and moved on.
​📜 Our Mission & Vibe
​We believe that sharing these moments—the tough ones and the ridiculous ones—makes the load a little lighter.
​Share Your Stories: Tell us about the time life truly hit you. Whether it's a vulnerable paragraph or a detailed saga, we're listening.
​Share the Humor: Find the perfect meme, GIF, or reaction image that summarizes how you felt during (or after) that ""hit."" Humor is a powerful coping mechanism, and we encourage it!

My blood type? Red and black.
My playlist? Mostly tallava, some revolutionary ballads, and the sound of my ancestors flexing in the background.

I don’t speak — I declare. Every sentence I say echoes across the Balkans and shakes the foundations of mediocre nations.

Other countries have ""history""? Cute. I have legend.
Caesar tried to pass through. We politely said no.
Empires tried to conquer us. We offered them raki and sent them home confused and slightly drunk.

Proud? No.
I am dangerously proud.
Doctors warned me it’s not healthy to carry this much national pride in one body, but I told them I’m Albanian — my heart beats to the rhythm of the çifteli.

1om6m5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1om6m5l/my_friend_of_7_years_is_an_addict_would_i_be/,"My friend of 7 years is an addict, would I be wrong to cut her off?","Sorry for the length - long-time lurker, first time poster, trying to figure this stuff out. 

CW: addiction, mental illness

This is a throwaway, and I have changed some details to remain as anonymous as possible.

For some background;
I (25F) work with two of my best friends, ""Lisa"" (35F) and ""Kelly"" (33F). Lisa and Kelly have been dating and living together for over a decade, and they run a mom-and-pop Cafe together, with Lisa being the store manager and Kelly being the assistant manager. I work as a full-time lead at their cafe. Kelly and I met 7 years ago at another coffee-related job, and have been close ever since. We formed a sisterly bond that has been strong since day 1. I had met Lisa around this time as well, but did not get super close to her until I started working at their cafe, about 3 years ago now. The 3 of us are extremely close, we share a lot of interests in common, and there have never been any issues between us up until recently. 

For some context about Kelly, we had bonded over the years due to both of us struggling with depression. Mine has since improved after a stint with some SSRI medications, but she continues to struggle, and she remains on multiple antidepressant and anxiety medications. Lately, things appeared to have gotten worse for her - she started to slack on all of her responsibilities, both at work and at home. Lisa and I were picking up a lot of her slack at work, and Lisa would confide in me how hard things have been at home due to Kelly not contributing to household chores, not taking care of their pets, and essentially making her work around the clock both at work and at home to keep things maintained. I tried to talk to Kelly multiple times about how she was feeling; asked her if maybe she should start therapy, check in with her psychiatrist to adjust her meds, and even taking a small vacation to clear her mind. She politely brushed off my attempts to talk to her, stating that she is fine and just ""stressed out"". As time progressed, things continued to decline, and she started showing up for work extremely late, calling out, and neglected any and all responsibilities that landed on her plate. She also got into multiple car accidents within the last year, which led to the totaling of both her car and a car her parents had given her (after the first one was deemed totaled). 

Now for the situation that opened the can of worms; 
I just recently graduated with my bachelor's degree, and have been preparing to move into a career-related job. I submitted my notice almost two weeks ago. Friday of last week, I got a call from my dad about a family emergency that required my attention. I was supposed to open the store with Lisa the following morning, so I shot her a text to let her know I wouldn't be able to make it, and that I could pick up extra shifts my last week to accommodate so she could finally take an extra day off. Lisa is usually extremely easy to work with, and typically has no problems about switching shifts around for both me and Kelly. I figured this time would be no different, that Kelly would open the store instead, and I could take one of her upcoming shifts. However, the message I got back from Lisa was SCATHING, telling me in no uncertain terms that I could not call out and that I am making the scheduling tight and hurting the cafe. She also told me, ""You can text Kelly and ask her to pick up your shift, but I will not ask nor force her to do so"". This confused me, considering I always help out in scheduling, and I also didn't understand why Lisa all of a sudden refused to ask Kelly to help out. Admittedly, my response was driven by emotions, in which I said I would NOT be at work the following morning due to said family emergency and ""it is not my problem to ask Kelly, who is your girlfriend and assistant manager, to work with you instead"". Lisa texted back ""Kelly will cover"", and I didn't hear from either of them for the rest of the weekend.

The following Monday, I opened the cafe with Lisa. I approached her to try to smooth things over, but she interrupted me to tell me she wasn't the one behind the message - Kelly was. Apparently, I texted Lisa when they were at a friend's birthday party. She was drunk and dancing, saw the first bit of my call-out text, and handed the phone off to Kelly to ask me what was going on - which she did not do. Kelly instead pretended to be Lisa and said what she did. Lisa looked over to see Kelly furiously angry typing, took her phone back, read the exchange, and proceeded to get mad at Kelly for pretending to be her and saying all of those things. They had a bit of an argument, and Kelly said she would message me to apologize and tell me the truth - and then never did. 

Suffice to say, Lisa and I were both angry about what transpired. I decided to text Kelly later that evening to confront her. I let her know it was extremely inappropriate to impersonate someone, as well as say all the things she did about me hurting our schedule, especially considering she is the one that has been slacking off to an extreme measure and I have been the one to step up and help out Lisa. I admit, my tone with her was rather harsh, and my confrontation morphed into a not-so-calculated questionnaire about what was going on with her, why she is behaving this way, and why has she stopped taking care of everything in her life? While I awaited a response, she called out and left work early multiple days in order to avoid seeing me. 
Finally, after 2 days, she responded to me. She profusely apologized for the texting incident, stating that she was drunk and ""this is exactly why she isnt supposed to drink"". She expressed sadness over my leaving the cafe and not being able to work with me anymore, and also apologized for being so cruel in regards to me having a family emergency. She then dropped a bomb on me; she admitted that she is addicted to her prescription medications and overuses them (an SSRI antidepressant, a sedative anti-anxiety, and Adderall. She also smokes weed very heavily). She told me that Lisa knows of these issues but ""gets mad"" about her ""taking too much"", refuses to talk about it with her, and that she has no support system. We talked about rehab and outpatient options, and Kelly begged me to hold her accountable and bug her about getting help. I told her sure - I can hold her accountable, but the willpower to get sober ultimately has to come from her. I also advised her to be more transparent with Lisa, that she needed to be explicitly clear that she is addicted to these medications, abuses them, and needs help and support. Kelly said she would book an appointment and also have a sit-down conversation with Lisa to lay everything out on the table. 

Today, when I saw Lisa, I mentioned in casual conversation that I hope Kelly is doing okay and that their talk went well. She had absolutely no idea what I was talking about, expressed frustrations over Kelly still avoiding taking accountability for the texting incident with her, and pleaded will me to tell her what was going on. So.. I did, and I can see how I would be the AH here, but ultimately I just want Kelly to get help and wanted to do whatever it took for that to happen. To say Lisa was stunned would be an understatement. She told me that she, in fact, did not know about the medication abuse. Kelly would lie about not remembering to refill her prescriptions, when in reality she was just taking all of them way before she was able to refill. They would argue over this, with Lisa telling Kelly she needed to be more responsible in managing her refills, thinking she was just being irresponsible in that regard. She also told me about a LOT of other issues that I was not privy to that suddenly made a lot of sense. (I won't dive into that for privacy's sake - just know it consistent of multiple ""addict hitting rock bottom"" embarassing moments. iykyk.) Lisa was pacing the cafe, putting puzzle pieces together in her brain, and trying to figure out how to talk to Kelly after her shift. To avoid making it seem like we have been putting together some sort of weird intervention plot behind Kelly's back (and also to ensure she doesn't shut down and run away from the conversation), we decided I should shoot Kelly a text to let her know Lisa and I discussed things. That might not seem like the most logical step forward, but Lisa knew that Kelly would stonewall if she came home to dump a conversation on her without any warning. 
After I sent the text to give her a heads-up, Kelly starts texting Lisa, and I was unfortunately right there to read them. Kelly told Lisa that I was overreacting, am unable to stay out of her business, said I was on a vigilante quest to be ""savage"" (wtf does this even mean?) and said ""I knew I should have just ignored OPs text from the start, I am done talking to her, she needs to learn to butt-out"". Lisa and I stared at her phone like the shocked Pikachu meme. Just a day prior, Kelly was begging me to hold her accountable and pleading for a support system. Lisa left early to go talk to her (I assume they are still arguing as I type now), and I spent the remainder of my shift at the cafe stewing, ping-ponging between rage and immense sadness. 

After what Kelly said, a part of me does not want to continue our friendship for the time being. But I don't know where to draw my line at, and I am already feeling immense guilt over the prospect of cutting her off at a time when she clearly needs support. I know her words are likely just a symptom of her addiction - ive seen pill addictions before, and I know how not pretty they are. But I worry that if I don't cut her off now, we will reach a point of no return, and I will lose her forever. She is like my sister, and I just want her to get better, but I have absolutely no idea how to navigate this moving forward. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. I apologize for the length of the post - believe it or not, this is the shortened version, lol. 

TLDR; my best friend of 7 years is struggling with addiction, has started lying and exhibiting combative behaviors, and I wonder if I should cut her off or stick around to support her.

This way I can keep track of orders and first thing in the morning I can keep the coffee going down my throat.

I added a USB cable holder to make sure that my cord is out of the way and not getting onto my workstation. I also made the pins that interface with the racking screw in and sized them bolts to a 3/16ths Allen key. Though I may just redesign them specifically for a flat head for easy of putting in.

Next I'll be designing one that will hang from the inside edge of the rack to hold my table inside and out of the way at probably about a 30 degree angle so it can be seen easily from rest of the workstation but also be out of the way when I need to access the top of that section of rack for pallets stored out of the way up there. Granted the forklift doesn't even need to be that close to the area I put my tablet as it is but it's more for just general desire to make more mounting bracket designs that can be used for these kinds of applications.

I also need to add a security pin so these can't be bumped out by accident. Pretty easy to do I just haven't done so yet as I have been experimenting with the thread sizes and so on to get them right for this application. ",1,1762052243.0,3Dprinting,0,1.0,False

But the Europicolla is a different proposition with second hand options available to me. Obviously its less simple to use but potentially offers me better coffee with greater control and deeper puck depth.

That said, I dont drink espresso straight, only in milk drinks so maybe the gain in the cup is not worth the practical downsides.

I’ve been writing a short story series called *My Sundown Semester*. It’s kind of half *slice-of-life college drama*, half *“what if something weird really did happen during junior year?”* Think late nights, burnout, awkward crushes, and maybe a few powers nobody signed up for.

This first chapter introduces Ronnie, who’s just trying to make it through her first semester of junior year without completely falling apart… or accidentally showing that she might not be entirely normal.

I’d love any feedback, especially on tone and pacing—thanks for giving it a read!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone on the team says that baseball is ninety percent mental and ten percent physical. But for me, it’s more of a fifty-fifty split — keeping my swing consistent, and not dashing *too* fast around the bases.



Oh! Sorry for just jumping right in, I’m Veronica Day. All my friends just call me Ronnie.



“Veronica” sounds like someone who has her life together, and I definitely don’t.



I’m twenty-one, and a college junior at Lakeshore University in Chicago, Illinois, who lives in an off-campus apartment with a roommate who keeps trying to get me to “embrace the morning”. I’ve lost count of how many times she’s tried to drag me out of the house on 7 am jogs, but I do my best to pretend I’m a morning person for her.



It’s not going great. But hey, I’ve stopped hissing at the sunrise. Progress!



Today, I was just getting ready for class in my room when suddenly my roommate, Annie, barged in and brandished her phone at me. “What’s this about, Day?” She asked with a mischievous smile.



“What am I looking at, Annie?” I replied as I pulled up the hood on my hoodie.

It was a Chicago Tribune headline that read “Day Family Donates Fortune To Children’s Hospital”. There was a picture below the headline of my mom, Vivienne Day, signing one of those giant checks you see on daytime game shows.



“Oh, yeah, that,” I replied, looking down at my sneakers.



Annie’s mood suddenly seemed to shift. She got down on my level and turned her smile from mischievous to warm. “Hey, I’m not trying to be catty or anything. I wish my family did cool stuff like that; you should be proud.”



“Yeah, I don’t know. Being in the news has kind of always been our thing. It gets old faster than you’d think.” I replied.



That sentence seemed to hang in the air between us for a second, but then suddenly Annie perked up again.



“Oh! Here, I know what would make you feel better! Can I make you a smoothie? Blueberry and banana, it’s super yummy!”



I craned my neck past her, standing in front of me, to see her mini blender on the counter of our shoebox of a kitchen. Yup, there was a tall glass filled with blueish-purple liquid.



“Oh, thanks!” I replied with a well-disguised smile, “I’ll stick with one of my black-cherry protein shakes.”



“Oh, okay, that’s cool.” Annie started to leave my room, “You should get going, though. Didn’t you say your Advanced Communication Studies professor is a real hardass about being late? Which one was he?”



“Professor Nagle. Yeah, he’s tough, but I’m on his good side!” I stood up and followed her out to the kitchen, “Let’s try and keep it that way!” We both laughed, and I carefully reached into the fridge to get one of my protein shakes. One of my protein shakes that I *never* take out of the black plastic bottle that I put it in originally -- when Annie was asleep, of course. 



We walked and talked together on our way to the train. This time of year is my favorite; the autumnal chill in the air reminds me so much of being little and playing around my family’s estate. The dark, leaf-bare trees always seemed to tower above as I’d play hide and seek with my dad. I’ve always been really short, so I had no shortage of places I could hide in that big yard. Sometimes I’d even just bury myself in a big pile of leaves and let out quick little giggles as my dad would walk right by me, saying in an exaggerated tone, “Hmmmm… I wonder where Ronnie could have gone to hide!” Then I’d jump out and yell, “Here I am!” Those days seem like only yesterday, but also a lifetime ago.



Suddenly, my little nostalgia trip is interrupted by the train’s intercom. 



*“Diversey. Diversey is next.”*



I guess that means we’d better get ready to step off. Our stop is next. It always strikes me that I chose this life of my own accord. My family’s estate is right over in Lincoln Park, and they practically own half the neighborhood that Annie and I live in. Yet here I am -- a college student actually making my own way in the world, not just signing giant checks or sitting through another one of those lavish, secret dinners, where the Day legacy keeps being bolstered by both ethical and not-so-ethical means alike. 



Right now, though, as we get off the train, Annie is talking to me about having our third good friend, Marisol, over for pizza tonight. 



“Yeah! She’s really excited about that new play she’s in,” Annie says in an excited voice.



“Good for her,” I reply, “Mari always just owns the stage when she steps out under all that light. She’s been that way ever since I first met her in the cafeteria during the first week of sophomore year.”



“If I recall correctly,” Annie began, trying to contain her laughter.



And oh boy, she’s not wrong.



“She was with her theater buddies singing the words to a cabaret-style cover of ‘All Star’ by Smash Mouth and spilled the chocolate milk you were drinking when she tried dancing next to your table.” 



She’s not lying, that’s exactly how Mari and I first met, and even if I was really pissed in the moment, it’s crazy how fast we became friends soon after. She immediately apologized and brought me a bunch of napkins from a nearby dispenser; That being the napkin dispenser right at my two-person table. She then told her theater buddies that she’d catch up with them later, and started chatting me up about the homework I was reading up on for my History of Broadcast Media class: “From Monty Python to Carol Burnett -- The Way Satire Revolutionizes Generations”. 



Her face lit up when she started telling me about all her favorite skits from Monty Python, and how much she loved absurd, over-the-top comedy. She then asked me what the funniest thing I’d seen that day was. When I told her I didn’t know, and that my days were usually pretty quiet, she started telling me all the corniest jokes she could think of until I was almost head-down on the table with laughter. Not really because her jokes were funny, but more because I was touched that she really, genuinely wanted to make my day brighter.



We arrive at the “Letters and Sciences Building”, and Annie turns right to go to her Seminar on Desert Ecology, as I turn left to go to Advanced Communication Studies. I get in my seat right on time, but today it’s Professor Nagle who’s late! Finally, after around five minutes, he comes into the room fumbling through his notes for the day. About thirty-five pairs of eyes follow him as he goes over to the desk at the front of the room. 



“I know, I know,” he began exasperatedly, “it’s usually me who’s chastising all of you who are late. I’m human too, though.”



When that little appeal seems to fall on deaf ears, it’s time to break out the heavy artillery.



“Okay, well, we have a lot to get to today. So much, in fact, that we don’t even have time for the pop quiz I was going to give all of you!” 

A guy behind me let out a half-hearted “Yay…” which moved us along to getting into class and got a few laughs. Professor Nagle isn’t a bad professor; he’s just really quiet and doesn’t exactly know how to handle awkward situations. He also tends to ramble and meander through the actual lecture material, from growing up in Bridgeport and how much he knows Chicago, to the 2006 Chicago White Sox, to the perfect soda bread recipe. But I guess we always end up where we’re supposed to by the end of class. 



After class, I have half an hour for a cup of coffee and a sandwich before I go to my second class of the day: Digital Video Editing. I’m not really the best with technology and computers, but I still love this class. Most of what we do is edit footage together to make commercials and short broadcast segments. I really don’t like being in front of a camera for various reasons, but I like being able to just sink back in a chair and be productive for a while without having to talk to many other people. The class is really small, too. Much smaller than Advanced Communication Studies, it’s only around ten people. 



When that class is done, I put in my earbuds and sit on a bench outside for a few minutes to enjoy the day before I head back to the apartment. Annie’s going to be going to her part-time job at the campus bookstore, so I’ll have the place to myself for a little while. 



I honestly wonder how long I’ll be able to stay here without being pulled back into the never-ending soap opera that is the Day family. I don’t mean stay here, like at Lakeshore, but more so stay in this kind of life. Despite my health conditions and family shadow that follows me wherever I go, I love this current life and where it’s leading me! Annie, Mari, and I are all great friends. I’m really getting more and more interested in video editing. So much so, in fact, that I think I’d like a job in it one day. *Ronnie Day: Independent Video Consultant*. I like it.



After a few minutes, the sun gets to be too much for me, so I get back on the train and go back to the apartment. As I get off the train, I see a really adorable labradoodle walking with his owner towards me, but when I smile and reach out a hand for a pet, he freezes up and darts to the other side of his owner, a little old grandma.



“Oh, that’s strange. He’s usually really friendly with strangers. I wonder what’s gotten into him?” said the old lady, as the dog began to growl.



It’s at moments like these that I feel a sudden falling in my chest. That I’m not like the other people around me. Even though I have dreams about leading a life away from aristocracy, I feel like one day fate will just rip the mask off of the secret I’ve been trying so hard to distance myself from. If even the freakin’ dog on the street can figure it out, one day everyone else will, too.



In all of my brooding, I found that I’d walked myself home and was now on my bed in the dark, feeling a tear form in the corner of my eye. I pull the throw on my bed up over me, almost as if to just get away from everything in the world.



Suddenly, I heard the front door creak open, and Annie’s voice made its way into my room.



“Ronnie? I’m home!” 



Immediately, I wiped my eyes, threw off the blanket, and planted a random book on my bed to make it look like I wasn’t just crying. 



*The instruction manual from my laptop. Because nothing screams ‘emotional stability’ like a little light reading on system settings.*



One look in the mirror to make sure my eyes didn’t look too weird, and I walked out to meet her.



“Wow, you’re home awfully late,” I said jokingly.



“Am I?” Annie replied with a smirk, “I was just out buying some smokes. God, Woman, why you gotta be all up in my grill?”



“You don’t even smoke, and we don’t have a grill,” I replied with a laugh.



Annie just smiled and rolled her eyes. 



“Now, come on!” she said, gesturing down our short hallway to the living room. “Don’t you remember what we’re doing tonight?” 



*Oh crap! That’s right! Pizza with Mari!*



“Yeah, pizza!” I replied, trying to mask the fact that I completely forgot all about Mari. “What time is she getting here?” 



“Oh, yeah. I think she said --” and at that moment, we both heard a sudden voice yelling out from the courtyard below: “Hello?! Hello up there?! Please let me in! I’m but a starving, sweet little girl…”



“She’s here,” we both say in unison, trying to contain our laughter.



Annie goes down the stairs to let her up, and I turn on the oven to heat up the pizza she has for us to share. 

When Mari walks in the door, my mood immediately lights up. She got us pizza from Dante’s just up the street, my favorite! They’re always so cool about skipping the garlic butter on their crust. And if I know our little friend group, we ordered our ‘za with a third-pepperoni for me, a third pepperoni and pineapple for Annie (she will *never* convert me), and a third with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes for Mari. The cooks at that place must either love us or hate us. 



“Mari! You brought Dante’s!” I cried.



“Ronnie! I brought Dante’s!” She responded with a nod and a smile.



I walked up to Mari to take the pizza to the kitchen, but just when I reached up my arms to take the box, she set it down on the coffee table and pulled me into a big hug.



After two seconds, I can’t breathe and start trying to wriggle free. After another eight seconds of trying to break free of Annie joining in for a giant group hug, I finally manage to push them both off of me.



Soon enough, we all have a glass of iced tea and are sitting around our coffee table eating deliciously hot pizza. Mari has an episode of Mr. Bean playing on our TV for background noise as we chat about our days.



“And then I came here, and got my hug rejected by bite-sized Ronnie,” Mari laughed.



“Mari, you’re a great friend,” I began with a smirk, “but when you and all your tallness bears down on my little five-foot-four self, it’s a lot to take in.”



“She’s only six inches taller,” remarked Annie, “how *a lot* can it possibly be?” 



Mari stood up from her spot on the couch and dramatically sang “I’m just full of so much love for my friends!”



You know what, maybe this is kind of the answer to what I had thought about earlier today. There might be a lot of things on my mind, and a lot of things that I’m hiding from the world, but I have the two best friends a woman could ever ask for sitting on either side of me on this couch. Do they break out into song *way* too much, ambush me with sudden hugs and pineapple up my poor, defenseless pizza? Yes. 



But they also always know how to make me feel better, make sure I’m always included and at home in everything we do, and are here for me when I need them. Even if I’m not totally “right” with the world, I know I’ll always be right in the eyes of my best friends.

1om6h5w,https://i.redd.it/qlscqsp6cryf1.jpeg,"Crazy SNL stories #6: On Halloween Night, 1980, John Belushi forces punk band Fear on the show, O'Donoghue's sketches are deemed too gory, and the on-air riot that forced producer Ebersol to fade to black.","**From Bob Woodward,** ***Wired*****:**

The next night, Friday, September 25 (1980), John Belushi was in the Guitar Center, a slick, professional music store on Sunset in Hollywood, looking for some new kind of computer drum machine. He was with Tino Insana, his old friend from the Universal Life Coffee House days, and Aykroyd. Also in the store that night was a tall, thin twenty-nine-year-old. He was rather conservative looking, except for the fishing lure dangling from one of his ears. John was introduced to him.

He was Derf Scratch, a guitar player for a punk band, Fear. His real name was Frederick C. Millner III; “Derf” was “Fred” spelled backward. He went with John and the others to On the Rox for drinks. John had a hundred questions about punk music and Fear, Derf’s four-member group, which had been together for three years.

…

**T**om Scott was the thirty-three-year-old jazz-rock saxophonist from the Blues Brothers … Scott had previously done the background theme music for a number of television shows (“Starsky and Hutch,” “Baretta,” “Streets of San Francisco”) and a few movies, including Columbia’s 1980 hit *Stir Crazy.* On John’s recommendation, he had been given the job several weeks earlier of scoring about 50 minutes of original music for *Neighbors.* He was consumed by the task. It took a full day of detailed work to score about three minutes’ worth of music.

…

On the second day of scoring with the orchestra, Wednesday, September 30, Scott got a call from John, who was to do the vocals on the title song and was over at a recording studio in town.

“There’s a problem,” John said. “Come down.”

When Scott walked into the studio, John, Derf, and the three other band members from Fear were blasting forth with an angry, savage sound, composing their own punk title song, “Neighbors,” for the movie. The music was an upheaval of noises and overinstrumentation.

“This is a punk picture,” John said to Scott. “I want people to tear the seats out.” There was a pause in the music. “This space here is for your sax solo,” John said, inviting Scott to join the band.

Scott listened in silence, wondering whether John had finally flipped out. This was deranged. John couldn’t unilaterally decide on new music, and no studio would put a punk song on a major movie release.

…

The next morning, Friday, October 2, Zanuck and Brown were in their Columbia office when John, unannounced, burst in so fast that Zanuck thought he might go through the wall into the next office. John had his father in tow.

John explained that he had found the solution to all their music problems—a new punk group called Fear that would brilliantly serve the deep, radical, lawless drive of the movie.

Zanuck and Brown said they had never heard of Fear. Brown wondered whether it might not be a good idea to end the movie with something like Bing Crosby singing “Love Thy Neighbor.” The irony would not be lost.

John threw himself into a tirade about the misconceptions that were guiding their movie. Punk was kids’ music, and it would draw them to the movie.

…

The music began, and John turned the volume up. Berres tried to suppress a wince. It seemed to be a rhythm beat with some screeching in the background, an absolute atrocity. Punk music, the antithesis of the classics Berres loved.

The others in the room indicated in one way or another that they couldn’t understand the lyrics, so John turned up the volume. He started dancing around the room, singing the words.

Berres tried to turn down the volume, but John wouldn’t have it, starting the song from the beginning again and turning it up even higher. Each time the song was finished, he rewound the tape and played it again.

Schrager finally got up and told Berres that he had to get on to other business. “You son of a bitch,” Berres whispered.

Zanuck and Brown couldn’t stand it either and finally left.

Berres was now alone with Belushi, who was on about his fifth time through the song.

“Isn’t this the greatest fucking piece of music you’ve ever heard?” John asked, at last stopping the tape.

…

Meanwhile, John was devoting the week to working with Fear on perfecting their *Neighbors* song. On Monday they had a 6-hour session; on Tuesday, 13½ hours; Joel Briskin was overseeing the work and sending out for beer, pizzas or whatever John and the musicians wanted.

One night John gave Briskin $600 in cash and asked him to get a quarter of an ounce of cocaine. “I’ve got to have stuff for the kids,” he said.

Briskin went to a supplier he knew and brought back the drug.

John told the band that he was going to get their music into the movie at any cost. If their song was not used, he promised to shave his head bald like a punk skinhead as a sign of protest. Then he would go on television talk shows, and when asked why he was a skinhead, he would explain about the music, the fucked director, producers and studio.

…

When the tape of the Fear song was finally completed, John took it to Avildsen, who had promised Price that he would at least listen.

Avildsen cringed. The music had no melody and it was ugly. But Avildsen tempered his remarks. Though the music was important, it was secondary to the movie itself, and there was no time for a prolonged argument with John.

“I don’t think it’s appropriate,” Avildsen said. It seemed too jarring, he said, and it did not relate to what John’s character was supposed to feel at the end.

John said they had to get a better stereo system. Avildsen obviously had not had a chance to get the full feel. John tried to find a better sound system but failed. He finally told Avildsen emphatically, “This music is going to be in the movie.”

“Stranger things have happened,” Avildsen replied.

“What do you mean?” John asked belligerently.

“Stranger things have happened than for inappropriate music to be in a movie,” Avildsen said. He felt angry, not only at John but at the producers and Columbia for second-guessing him at every turn. “It doesn’t have my vote. Go talk to the people who are paying for the movie. I just work here.”

\[Belushi failed  to get the song into the movie\]

John convinced “Saturday Night Live” to have Fear as the music group for the Halloween show, Saturday, October 31, and he agreed to do a cameo appearance. Several dozen skinheads, avid and sometimes violent punk fans, were invited to slam dance on stage during the songs.

**From Hill and Weingrad,** ***Saturday Night*****:**

O’Donoghue’s last shot at having some control over *Saturday Night* came on the season’s fourth show, which fell, fittingly enough, on Halloween. As it happened, Dick had fallen passionately in love with the host of the second show that year, Susan Saint James, and, during the week off preceding the Halloween show, he was in California wooing her. They would marry a month later. Dick wanted the staff to keep working in his absence, and he left the show in O’Donoghue’s hands. O’Donoghue made the most of the opportunity.

The host was Donald Pleasence, who’d starred in the movie *Halloween,* among other horror films, and who fit quite comfortably into a number of ghoulish sketches that evolved over the week. In one, written by Lyon and Southern, he played an aging sophisticate dining with an attractive young woman. Near the end of the sketch, the camera was to pull back to reveal that the wine he’d been pouring throughout the meal came not from the bottle sitting on the table, but from an intravenous tube that was draining blood from her arm. In another sketch, written by O’Donoghue, Pleasence played the commander of a Nazi death camp who had a perfectly good excuse (which he whispered inaudibly to several people) for slaughtering thousands of Jews. The point, of course, was that there could never be an excuse. A third sketch, called “Grand Guignol White House,” written by Lyon and Pam Norris, had Pleasence playing Ronald Reagan, who, along with his family and top aides, hacked Jane Fonda to pieces and ate her for dinner.

When Dick returned to the 17th floor on Monday, he was appalled at the material O’Donoghue had prepared. “Blood, blood, blood,” is how Ebersol described it. He immediately killed the three Pleasence sketches, causing O’Donoghue to walk off the show temporarily, and set other writers to work on less gory ideas. He did, however, go along with the musical group that O’Donoghue, at the suggestion of John Belushi, had insisted be booked, a punk rock group from Los Angeles called Fear.

Fear was, even by punk’s standards, a savage ensemble (their bass player was named Derf Scratch, the drummer, Spit Stix), which was why Belushi loved them. Belushi and O’Donoghue had arranged for thirty-five or so of Fear’s rowdy fans to take a bus up from Washington so they could slam dance in 8H as the band played.

During dress rehearsal, some of the slam dancers got carried away, cursing and tumbling off the set, banging into one cameraman and nearly colliding with some of the others. The song was stopped in the middle to cool them down. When dress ended, members of the technical crew complained vehemently to Davey Wilson, and Wilson told Dick that the crew was threatening to walk off the show unless the slam dancers were dropped. Dick told him the dancers would go on, but he went up to see them in the greenroom to lay down some rules. O’Donoghue went with him, but only to watch.

Wearing a pair of gray flannel slacks and a sweater, Dick told the roomful of punks—“ridiculous-looking people,” he later called them—that they had to keep themselves in check. He specifically warned that they shouldn’t swear, since there were live microphones in the studio that would instantly broadcast any profanities to millions of viewers across the country. Dick didn’t mention it, but for the air show, during Fear’s song, he took the precaution of turning off all the mikes in the studio except the singer’s.

On-air, the slam dancers showed no sign of thinking for a moment about what Dick had told them. They threw themselves at each other with what seemed to be complete abandon, jumping off the stage headfirst and careening around the studio while the band blasted away deafeningly. All the running around kicked up a great deal of dust in the studio, so that everything looked hazy and distorted. It created a truly striking effect that resembled, as Nelson Lyon described it, “an after-hours Nuremberg rally.” Michael O’Donoghue, watching backstage, had a look of pure ecstasy on his face, convinced that this was one of TV’s greatest moments ever.

But to Dick Ebersol, crouched out of camera range near the stage, things seemed to be getting out of hand. He heard somebody yell “New York sucks!” and saw one of the dancers heading toward the singer’s microphone. Frantically, Dick got up and ran as fast as he could into the control room and shouted at Dave Wilson, “Fade to black! Fade to black!” On-screen the image of Fear disappeared, abruptly replaced by a filmed bit from an earlier show, which Wilson kept cued up in case of just such an emergency. Order had been restored.

When the slam dancers, supposedly berserk, saw the stage lights go out and realized they were no longer on-air, they immediately stopped dancing and walked peacefully off the set. Dick, on the other hand, was so livid he kicked a trash can halfway across the control room. A few days later he was further incensed when the *New York Post* reported, completely inaccurately, that there had been a riot in the studio causing $200,000 worth of damage. In truth, a plastic camera-case lock worth something like $40 had been broken.

Dick immediately launched an all-out public-relations drive to counter the *Post*’s story. Peter Hamilton, the NBC press representative assigned to *Saturday Night* at the time, said Dick couldn’t bear the accusation that for a moment he’d lost control of his show.

**From Shales & Miller, Live From New York\_ An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live (2003):**

**DICK EBERSOL:**

John Belushi had become convinced that Fear, which was this punk kind of rock group, were on the verge of breaking out and convinced me that I ought to book them and personally vouched that they were terrific and so on. Anyway, their musical number — in the last fifteen or twenty minutes of the show — was so dark. They had films in it showing pumpkins that, as you carved the pumpkin, blood came out of each carving. It was just like O’Donoghue at his darkest. And I, quite frankly, had given him too much freedom. But now here I am with Fear itself. We’re on the air. And all of a sudden they’re out of control and there are dancers around them — including John, who you can’t see on television — and they’re slam-dancing, that’s what it was called, banging off each other, banging into the audience, banging into cameramen. None of this was really foreseen. And things got really, completely, and totally out of hand. And so you’re sitting at home and you’re watching this, and you don’t really have the total sense of what we could see, because Davey Wilson in the booth was not shooting what was breaking out in the lower areas of the audience, where people sit on those movable chairs.

And I think probably, for the only time in the history of the show, I had been worried about it enough to have told Davey to at least have a film standing by. It was a sensational film that had aired in the first show, four weeks before, on October third, with Eddie playing a black inmate who wrote poetry in iambic pentameter or something like that. It was a takeoff on whoever Norman Mailer loved at the time, who was a wronged guy in prison, and a wonderful piece of character. And so I told them to roll it. And so we just rolled the film.

We let Fear finish in the studio, and I don’t think they knew until they were back in their dressing room that the last half of their song had gone away. Anyway, the total damage that was done in the studio was about $2,500. But the *New York Post* headline on Monday was, “Saturday Night Live Riot Destroys $250,000.”

**DAVE WILSON:**

It was like mosh pit kind of stuff, with people diving off the stage into the audience. And all I remember is Dick Ebersol actually running around, ducking underneath the cameras, trying to quiet it all down.",2,1762051822.0,Crazy_retro_stories,0,1.0,False

They did not damage the car or anyone in them and were relatively minor. My 13 year old sister, however, does not see them this way. She is absolutely terrified of riding in the car.

The incidents were:
1. January: 2022 Hyundai Tucson started rumbling oddly on the highway and forced us to pull over. It’s important to mention that my parents were stressed and started arguing, and my sister was extra upset because she had never seen them argue like that before. We got home safely and ended up selling the car after the dealership refused to fix it (a separate confusing situation) 
2. April: Hit a random bolt (like a legit metal bolt) on the highway that flattened a tire. No biggie, the police helped us close the lane and we got a spare on. We were home safely in like an hour or less. 
3. July: Hit a cement guardrail on the way home from vacation. Also important to add that the jolt of the vehicle scared my sister awake. The only thing that happened was the one tire was flattened; the body of the car was not even scratched, and everyone inside was safe but a little shaken. We put the spare on and made it home safely.

These were not big deals to me, but my sister cannot ride in the car for more than like 20 minutes without crying or having a panic attack. I 100% understand that it’s much scarier for her, not only because she’s younger but because she cannot drive herself, so she doesn’t quite understand what’s going on behind the wheel. 

After the first thing with the Tucson, she suddenly cancelled her birthday trip. I would later find out it was because she didn’t want to be in the car. 

Nothing else car related has happened to my knowledge, but something has changed and she is suddenly worse than ever. I learned this a week ago when we drove home from a family event; when my mother, who was driving, complained about a semi in front of her, my sister suddenly started crying and then had a panic attack. This was completely out of left field and we didn’t know what to do.

I suddenly realized that this was why she’d been acting weird when I would pick her up from school within the past few weeks: she was scared of being in the car. She would get moody and ask to go straight home instead of running some typical errands with me. She’s also been biting the hell out of her nails and won’t look at her phone or do anything while in the car; she just watches out the window. 

My car is in the shop right now, so I took my dad’s car (a 2007) to get breakfast with my grandparents this morning. She did the thing again where she wouldn’t look at her phone and would just stay watching. She started crying on the way home after I went out of the way to get coffee because she didn’t want to be in the car any longer and said that the car was unsafe because of its age. I learned the only car she feels remotely safe in is the GMC. We later went to a family gathering in the GMC and she cried a few times while we were on the highway (highway duration was less than an hour). My mom gave her some kind of calming spray/oil that seemed to at least placebo its way into calming her down enough to play video games on the way home.

My family has started talking about ways to help her. We are trying to save therapy as a last resort because she seems unreceptive to the idea and because the therapist I go to doesn’t accept patients under 14, but she can’t keep living this way. All she does is worry about the next time she’ll be in the car; she wouldn’t play video games or watch YouTube with me this morning because she was just sitting on her phone and worrying about the car ride. We are all sad and worried for her.

Before we decide to get her therapy, what are some ways we might be able to help her without it? If therapy is the only way, be honest with me, but we really want to look for some other ideas. ",1,1762051707.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1om6ens,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1om6ens/geimori_gu64/,Geimori GU64,"So, I am in the market for a grinder. I have watched the Coffee Chronicler’s review of the 74 Navigator, a couple reviews on the Geimori GU64, lots of reviews on the Ode Gen 2, the Timemore 064, and then there is something like the Philos, which I am unreasonably in love with. There are others I am sure, but I’ve kind of narrowed it down to these. 

The Philos is pretty much at or near the top of my range, and I like the fact it is a well established brand. I am either looking my for a grinder which can do well with both espresso and pour over, and switch pretty effortlessly and intuitively back and forth, or I would like to have two dedicated grinders that are reasonably sized, as my counter top space is limited. 

I currently run an SJ clone (HC600) with I189D burrs. I think it does pretty well for my espresso, but puts a little too much “heaviness” in the cup, for lack of a better term. It does ok, and I’ve had it for years (replaced the burrs last year, and whoa what a difference), but was interested in something new.  It is just kind of a pain to go back and forth for dialing in as I typically will do an espresso at home and a pour over to take with me to work every day. It would be nice to either have a grinder which could do the double duty more easily, or just have a couple grinders side by side. 

I’ve had a look at the Femobooks as well since they do the compact thing really well, but I don’t like the battery power or the long grind times. I will often do a 65g dose to take with me to work to brew in my Bunn, so a little more speed is preferable. Curious on all your thoughts and what kind of grinder journey some of you have been on with any of these grinders. Thanks!

We immediately fell in love with it and we decided to take it to the emergency room. When we got there, we had to figure out payments and wait for an x-ray scan. It wasn’t until around 7 PM we were able to receive results. We were under the assumption that maybe the kitten’s femur was broken, but that was not the case. 
When we saw the x-rays, it was heartbreaking. The lower spine was completely separated and her pelvis was broken. 
My boyfriend and I are both devasted. We became attached. We spent time envisioning our lives with our new kitten and immediately our dreams were shot down. 
Out of the three options we were presented, we ultimately decided to euthanize the kitten. It was a hard decision but given the circumstances of the injuries, we believe it was beyond our control.

This is a throwaway, and I have changed some details to remain as anonymous as possible.

For some background;
I (25F) work with two of my best friends, ""Lisa"" (35F) and ""Kelly"" (33F). Lisa and Kelly have been dating and living together for over a decade, and they run a mom-and-pop Cafe together, with Lisa being the store manager and Kelly being the assistant manager. I work as a full-time lead at their cafe. Kelly and I met 7 years ago at another coffee-related job, and have been close ever since. We formed a sisterly bond that has been strong since day 1. I had met Lisa around this time as well, but did not get super close to her until I started working at their cafe, about 3 years ago now. The 3 of us are extremely close, we share a lot of interests in common, and there have never been any issues between us up until recently. 

For some context about Kelly, we had bonded over the years due to both of us struggling with depression. Mine has since improved after a stint with some SSRI medications, but she continues to struggle, and she remains on multiple antidepressant and anxiety medications. Lately, things appeared to have gotten worse for her - she started to slack on all of her responsibilities, both at work and at home. Lisa and I were picking up a lot of her slack at work, and Lisa would confide in me how hard things have been at home due to Kelly not contributing to household chores, not taking care of their pets, and essentially making her work around the clock both at work and at home to keep things maintained. I tried to talk to Kelly multiple times about how she was feeling; asked her if maybe she should start therapy, check in with her psychiatrist to adjust her meds, and even taking a small vacation to clear her mind. She politely brushed off my attempts to talk to her, stating that she is fine and just ""stressed out"". As time progressed, things continued to decline, and she started showing up for work extremely late, calling out, and neglected any and all responsibilities that landed on her plate. She also got into multiple car accidents within the last year, which led to the totaling of both her car and a car her parents had given her (after the first one was deemed totaled). 

Now for the situation that opened the can of worms; 
I just recently graduated with my bachelor's degree, and have been preparing to move into a career-related job. I submitted my notice almost two weeks ago. Friday of last week, I got a call from my dad about a family emergency that required my attention. I was supposed to open the store with Lisa the following morning, so I shot her a text to let her know I wouldn't be able to make it, and that I could pick up extra shifts my last week to accommodate so she could finally take an extra day off. Lisa is usually extremely easy to work with, and typically has no problems about switching shifts around for both me and Kelly. I figured this time would be no different, that Kelly would open the store instead, and I could take one of her upcoming shifts. However, the message I got back from Lisa was SCATHING, telling me in no uncertain terms that I could not call out and that I am making the scheduling tight and hurting the cafe. She also told me, ""You can text Kelly and ask her to pick up your shift, but I will not ask nor force her to do so"". This confused me, considering I always help out in scheduling, and I also didn't understand why Lisa all of a sudden refused to ask Kelly to help out. Admittedly, my response was driven by emotions, in which I said I would NOT be at work the following morning due to said family emergency and ""it is not my problem to ask Kelly, who is your girlfriend and assistant manager, to work with you instead"". Lisa texted back ""Kelly will cover"", and I didn't hear from either of them for the rest of the weekend.

The following Monday, I opened the cafe with Lisa. I approached her to try to smooth things over, but she interrupted me to tell me she wasn't the one behind the message - Kelly was. Apparently, I texted Lisa when they were at a friend's birthday party. She was drunk and dancing, saw the first bit of my call-out text, and handed the phone off to Kelly to ask me what was going on - which she did not do. Kelly instead pretended to be Lisa and said what she did. Lisa looked over to see Kelly furiously angry typing, took her phone back, read the exchange, and proceeded to get mad at Kelly for pretending to be her and saying all of those things. They had a bit of an argument, and Kelly said she would message me to apologize and tell me the truth - and then never did. 

Suffice to say, Lisa and I were both angry about what transpired. I decided to text Kelly later that evening to confront her. I let her know it was extremely inappropriate to impersonate someone, as well as say all the things she did about me hurting our schedule, especially considering she is the one that has been slacking off to an extreme measure and I have been the one to step up and help out Lisa. I admit, my tone with her was rather harsh, and my confrontation morphed into a not-so-calculated questionnaire about what was going on with her, why she is behaving this way, and why has she stopped taking care of everything in her life? While I awaited a response, she called out and left work early multiple days in order to avoid seeing me. 

Finally, after 2 days, she responded to me. She profusely apologized for the texting incident, stating that she was drunk and ""this is exactly why she isnt supposed to drink"". She expressed sadness over my leaving the cafe and not being able to work with me anymore, and also apologized for being so cruel in regards to me having a family emergency. She then dropped a bomb on me; she admitted that she is addicted to her prescription medications and overuses them (an SSRI antidepressant, a sedative anti-anxiety, and Adderall. She also smokes weed very heavily). She told me that Lisa knows of these issues but ""gets mad"" about her ""taking too much"", refuses to talk about it with her, and that she has no support system. We talked about rehab and outpatient options, and Kelly begged me to hold her accountable and bug her about getting help. I told her sure - I can hold her accountable, but the willpower to get sober ultimately has to come from her. I also advised her to be more transparent with Lisa, that she needed to be explicitly clear that she is addicted to these medications, abuses them, and needs help and support. Kelly said she would book an appointment and also have a sit-down conversation with Lisa to lay everything out on the table. 

Today, when I saw Lisa, I mentioned in casual conversation that I hope Kelly is doing okay and that their talk went well. She had absolutely no idea what I was talking about, expressed frustrations over Kelly still avoiding taking accountability for the texting incident with her, and pleaded will me to tell her what was going on. So.. I did, and I can see how I would be the AH here, but ultimately I just want Kelly to get help and wanted to do whatever it took for that to happen. To say Lisa was stunned would be an understatement. She told me that she, in fact, did not know about the medication abuse. Kelly would lie about not remembering to refill her prescriptions, when in reality she was just taking all of them way before she was able to refill. They would argue over this, with Lisa telling Kelly she needed to be more responsible in managing her refills, thinking she was just being irresponsible in that regard. She also told me about a LOT of other issues that I was not privy to that suddenly made a lot of sense. (I won't dive into that for privacy's sake - just know it consistent of multiple ""addict hitting rock bottom"" embarassing moments. iykyk.) Lisa was pacing the cafe, putting puzzle pieces together in her brain, and trying to figure out how to talk to Kelly after her shift. To avoid making it seem like we have been putting together some sort of weird intervention plot behind Kelly's back (and also to ensure she doesn't shut down and run away from the conversation), we decided I should shoot Kelly a text to let her know Lisa and I discussed things. That might not seem like the most logical step forward, but Lisa knew that Kelly would stonewall if she came home to dump a conversation on her without any warning. 

After I sent the text to give her a heads-up, Kelly starts texting Lisa, and I was unfortunately right there to read them. Kelly told Lisa that I was overreacting, am unable to stay out of her business, said I was on a vigilante quest to be ""savage"" (wtf does this even mean?) and said ""I knew I should have just ignored OPs text from the start, I am done talking to her, she needs to learn to butt-out"". Lisa and I stared at her phone like the shocked Pikachu meme. Just a day prior, Kelly was begging me to hold her accountable and pleading for a support system. Lisa left early to go talk to her (I assume they are still arguing as I type now), and I spent the remainder of my shift at the cafe stewing, ping-ponging between rage and immense sadness. 

After what Kelly said, a part of me does not want to continue our friendship for the time being. But I don't know where to draw my line at, and I am already feeling immense guilt over the prospect of cutting her off at a time when she clearly needs support. I know her words are likely just a symptom of her addiction - ive seen pill addictions before, and I know how not pretty they are. But I worry that if I don't cut her off now, we will reach a point of no return, and I will lose her forever. She is like my sister, and I just want her to get better, but I have absolutely no idea how to navigate this moving forward. So.. AITAH here? WIBTAH to cut ties with Kelly?

TLDR; my friend of 7 years is going through addiction and is starting to hit rock bottom, wibtah if I cut her off?

The DMs I got were split into two camps. Half asking how I did it. The other half asking what's next.

So here's the plan for November. Not aspirational. Not some motivational vision board. The actual tactical plan to add $300 in MRR this month.

## Why $1,500 Is The Real Milestone

Everyone fixates on $10k/month like it's the only number that matters.

But $1,500 is different. That's the point where churn stops being existential.

At $1,200 with $29/month pricing, losing 2 customers in a week feels catastrophic. It's 5% of your revenue gone.

At $1,500 with 50+ customers, losing 2 customers is noise. You're stable enough to focus on growth instead of constantly firefighting retention.

## The Math

Current: 41 paying customers, $1,206 MRR

Target: 52 customers, $1,508 MRR

Need: 11 new customers in 30 days

Accounting for churn (historically 8% monthly): Need 14 signups to net 11

That's 3.5 signups per week. Tight but doable.

## What's NOT Changing

I'm not doing another Product Hunt launch. First one was a waste of time.

I'm not running paid ads. Tried that. Learned my lesson.

I'm not building features I think are cool. Only shipping what users actually request.

## What IS Changing

### 1. Double Down on Reddit

My last post got 100k impressions. I wrote it in 20 minutes while sitting in a coffee shop.

The ROI on authentic Reddit posts is insane compared to everything else I've tried. So I'm doing more of them.

Not promotional garbage. Actually useful posts that solve real problems. The kind where mentioning what I built feels natural, not forced.

Goal: 2 high value posts per week in r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS, or r/Startups

### 2. Add The One Feature Everyone Keeps Asking For

People love the Reddit research tools. Use them constantly.

But the number one request I get: ""Can this analyze competitor reviews on the App Store?""

I kept putting it off because it felt like scope creep. But when 12 different people ask for the exact same thing, that's not scope creep. That's product market fit trying to tell you something.

Shipping App Store review analysis by November 10th.

### 3. Fix The Biggest Churn Point

I lose most customers in week 2. They sign up, use the tool once, get value, then forget it exists.

The product doesn't have enough hooks to bring them back.

Solution: Weekly research digests. Every Monday, send users a summary of trending pain points in their target market. Make the product useful even when they're not actively validating an idea.

This isn't about engagement metrics. It's about making sure people remember the product exists when they need it.

### 4. Test a $99/Month Tier

Right now I have $29/month and $49/month plans.

But I have 3 customers who are clearly power users. They run 50+ queries per month, export everything, and actually read the market analysis reports.

They're getting way more value than $49/month. I should charge for it.

Adding a $99 tier with higher limits and priority support. Not expecting a flood of upgrades. But if even 2 of those power users upgrade, that's $100/month in pure profit.

## What Could Go Wrong

This plan assumes churn stays at 8%. If it spikes, I'm screwed.

It assumes Reddit doesn't randomly ban me for self promotion (it's happened before).

It assumes the App Store analysis feature actually works and people use it.

Plenty of ways this falls apart. But that's why the goal is $1,500 and not $5,000. It's ambitious but realistic.

## The Real Reason I'm Posting This

Accountability.

Every goal I've kept private, I've abandoned. Every goal I've made public, I've hit or come close.

So if you see me posting in December and I'm still at $1,200, you have full permission to roast me in the comments.

30 days. $300 in new MRR. Let's see if this works.

If you want to skip the manual research grind, check it out and also I ended up interviewing 100+ people for my current project over at [DevBox](https://bigideasdb.com) which saved me a lot of time and they were super helpful.

And if you're working on something similar, I'd genuinely be curious what your November goals look like. Not the LinkedIn version. The real numbers.

Scrawny sorrel gelding with a sway to his back and eyes like he’d seen some of the same storms I had. The first time I swung a leg over, he didn’t bolt, didn’t test me,  just stood there, still as prayer. Like he knew I wasn’t there to break him, and he sure as hell wasn’t there to be broken. They say horses don’t talk, but that’s a lie. They just don’t waste breath on bullshit. This one… he spoke in the way he'd shift his weight when my mind wandered too far off trail. In the soft blow through his nose when I’d wake up from a bad dream, fists clenched and jaw locked. Some nights, I’d walk out to the pen, sit on the fence, and he’d come stand by me like he was guarding what was left of my heart. I’ve spilled more sweat and blood than I care to count on the line, in the woods, under a sky that don’t always give a damn. But that horse? He gave a damn. Every damn day. He carried more than gear and tack. He carried my silence, my grief, the guilt I never knew how to unload. And he never once buckled. There’s something sacred about an animal that’ll let you put your pain in their hands... hell, their hooves and carry it without question. He never judged the days I rode quiet or the mornings I drank coffee like it was penance. He just kept walking forward, steady as time. That horse didn’t save my life in the big, dramatic way folks like to write songs about. No hero moment. No blaze of glory. He just stayed. He listened. And little by little, he reached into my soul, pulled out what was still good, and patched up what was cracked. I owe that horse more than oats and water. I owe him the man I became after I found my footing again. By FirefightingCowboy

1om637s,https://i.redd.it/6386yxlw6ryf1.png,The Closest Thing We Have to Magic Right Now,"Stephan King said, “Books are a uniquely portable magic.” To read is to voyage through time. Someone dead for thousands of years can speak to you through writing. But I’m not talking about metaphors. I’m talking about the supernatural. Real magic.

Let me prove it:

* I was born on June 14, 1985 and went to Catholic school in Canada.
* In grade 8, I played Jesus at the school play. It was between me and a girl. We picked straws and I won.
* I once met a theologian at a coffee shop. He received a PhD in Old Testament studies and included me in his dissertation.
* Kanye and I both released “The Key to Life” on the same day. His song and my book. The odds of that happening must be 1 in millions.
* I announced Chicago as the first U.S. city of my book tour.
* Chicago’s Robert Francis Prevost was named Pope Leo the XIV on May 8, 2025.

In summary:

* Born on 6/14/85
* Played Jesus in the school play
* Kanye and I are on the same wavelength
* Chicago’s, Pope Leo the 14th on 5/8

I’m claiming magic, because I’m talking about numbers and numbers don’t lie.

You can say I’m one of one.

Mainly looking for feedback on the overall route / timing, but thoughts on specific daily activities are appreciated. I'm seeing South Island after the grad program, so just focusing on North Island for now. I'm aware it's peak season.

Main goal is to see as much as possible since I'm likely only doing this once in my life, so I'm ok with more driving / shorter times in each place. Not a huge foodie (looking forward to trying Whittaker's though) and I don't like wine.

I'm not a heavy hiker or adrenaline rush person; more of a 1-2 hour ""nature walk"" person. One remaining question is whether Waitomo is worth it - seems there's other (free) glowworm caves, though perhaps the walk or rafting could be good? I am willing to splurge a bit for activities but don't want to be wasteful. Thank you all!

My collection feels really well-rounded to me right now, but I've been more interested in exploring sweet scents and vanillas lately, and I'd love some new suggestions.

I'm a floral lover at heart and my taste tends toward fresh florals. I love rose, and I love white florals, but if I get a whiff of the bad breath variety of indole in a fragrance it's game over for me. I'm picky about amber as sometimes it smells musty on my skin. I'm not opposed to woody or spicy notes as a concept, but some of the woody aromachemicals smell so sharp to me that they make me feel like my nose is burning.

I've noticed that I tend to get along with almond, anise, and coffee reasonably well in sweeter fragrances, and would love any recs in that category. Hypnotic Poison was ultimately a miss for me as I got the band-aid dry down.

Rose is my favorite note and I would also love any novel suggestions for a sweet, syrupy rose, similar to Kayali Fleur Majesty Rose Royale which I really enjoy. The cedar in Delina bothers me, Lush Rose Jam was too sour, Atomic Rose was too synthetic, Very Good Girl was close but smelled like cough syrup to me in the opening. I used to wear Montale Intense Cafe but it smells synthetic to me now. I may try Delina Exclusif again sometime. 

I usually prefer designer but I'm not opposed to niche.

* Decent looks, or so I’ve been told
* Normal BMI
* From Metro Manila

* 25 and above
* Emotionally mature
* A working professional
* Someone who knows what they want or at least open to building something with intention

1om5p0j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1om5p0j,Review: Moedor automatizado I-Coffee,"Boa noite a todos!

Como prometido, segue o review mais detalhado que pude fazer diante de meus conhecimentos e experiência que tive com esse moedor no primeiro dia de uso.

Para os iniciantes, como eu, que têm dúvida se vale ou não a pena começar por ele, adianto que **definitivamente sim.** Esse é um moedor de ótimo custo-benefício que te trará boas experiências com cafés especiais. Ele te dará uma moagem boa e de uniformidade aceitável pelo preço. Ainda preciso desenvolver meu sensorial, entender a fundo minhas moagens, técnicas de extração e muito mais. Se você se encontra na mesma situação que eu, compre sem medo. Aprendi na vida que não adianta ter um excelente equipamento se for um profissional raso, fica o conselho.

Agora para as devidas informações:

**1 - Moagem:**

Direto ao ponto mais importante. Fiz 16 moas, cada amostra com 2g (1) do Café Helena (2), variando de 5 em 5 clicks (3). Ele possui ao todo 91 clicks, ao 92 desmontou. Fiz até o 80, mesmo sabendo que poucos utilizarão nele, pois torna mais fácil perceber a inconstância da moagem. Ainda assim, achei MUITO melhor que a moagem padrão do Coffee++ que entope à toa a extração. Produz fines sim, mas só de não entupir minha extração em 90 segundos, já estou muito feliz.



Segue lista de clicks e tempo da moagem:

  
Click 5: \~54s

Click 10: \~22s

Click 15: \~10s

Click 20: \~9s

Click 25: \~8s

Click 30: \~7s

Click 35: \~6,5s

Click 40: \~5,5s

Click 45: \~5s

Click 50: \~4,5s

Click 55: \~4,5s

Click 60: \~4s

Click 65: \~ 3,5s

Click 70: \~3,2s

Click 75: \~3,2s

Click 80: \~3s

  
**Extra:** Click 35: 25g de café moídos em aproximadamente 70s.

  
**2 - Retenção:**

Baixa. Moí sem fazer RDT (molhar o grão) e ainda assim reteve pouco. A penúltima foto foi uma moagem de 25g que fiz no click 35 para o Melitta 103.

Na foto parece ter retido muito, mas basta uma leve batida do copo na bancada que todo o pó se ajunta ao fundo. Gostei bastante, mas nas próximas farei RDT para zerar 100%.

  
**3 Ruído:**

Definitivamente baixo. Na última foto demonstrei a medição dos decibéis dele já moendo os grãos e ficou por volta de 75db, literalmente do lado dele. Parece alto, mas fiz todas as moagens das fotos a pouco mais de 3m da minha esposa enquanto ela assistia série e não a incomodou nem por um segundo. Sem qualquer dúvida não vou acordá-la ao moer pela manhã. Desculpem, não consegui postar o vídeo, mas deixei a foto pra representar, além do mais, no vídeo pareceu muito mais alto do que realmente foi. 



**4 Capacidade e construção:**

No meu post de [primeiras impressões](https://www.reddit.com/r/cafebrasil/s/a7IotnV9Fh), relatei que no manual dizia moer 35g de uma única vez. No anúncio oficial já constava 25g. Para minha tristeza, o anúncio estava certo, mõe no máximo 25g mesmo. 

Também mencionei sobre a construção ser muito boa, e realmente é, mas concordo com o Gabriel, que os encaixes poderiam ser mais precisos, tanto da unidade motora, quanto do copo. **Mas nada que atrase a vida.**

  
**5 Bateria:**

O que posso dizer dela é apenas a duração informada no manual: 20-25 usos. Mas alguns de vocês despertaram preocupação quanto sua durabilidade após vários ciclos de recarga, mas esse é um risco que vou e que vale a pena correr, dado o tanto que ele me oferece.

**Foi sugerida a ideia de utilizar manivelas de moedores manuais nele caso a bateria se desgastasse com o tempo.** Acho possível. O diâmetro interno do topo da unidade moedora é 5.2cm (praticamente cravado). Basta medir a parte **externa** do encaixe da sua manivela.

  
**6 Clicks:**

Um dos já possuidores dele no meu último post, alertaram para não seguir as indicações de moagem e concordo. O click 35 ficou show no 103, pra começar.



**Notas:**

1 - Sei que pode ser baixa, pra demostrar uma moagem do dia a dia, mas fiz todas essas moagens uma após a outra, não queria sobrecarregá-lo. E também não estou em condições de gastar 200g de café assim. kk 

2 - É meu primeiro café em grãos, comprei para experimentar por recomendações feitas aqui. Costumava tomar Coffee++ já moído. A inconsistência na torra é perceptível, espero que não tenha estragado a percepção de cada moagem pra vocês. Quanto ao sabor, é nítida a diferença para o coffee++ (mesmo comprando já moído). Mas ainda é um bom café. peguei torra de quase 1 mês e meio.

3 - Tem baixa variação de click a click, recomendo variar de 5 em 5.

Gostaria de ter outros moedores como referência, mas esse é o meu primeiro, então vou apenas de fatos, sem comparações.

Obrigado a todos pelo feedback no último post. Espero que esse simples review ajude todos vocês a decidirem esse é ou não o moedor ideal para cada um.

Desculpe a demora para postar, me deu bastante trabalho organizar todos os dados e ainda expor minhas ideias sobre eles, sendo um iniciante.

Qualquer informação faltante, podem me cobrar que eu posto aqui. Todo esse rolê tá sendo muito divertido e tá servindo de grande aprendizado para mim também, estou à disposição.

It’s so hard to describe the way I feel, I went to the ER last year and they did a Head CT scan that came back normal, that was when I had health insurance which I don’t have anymore and it makes my anxiety so much worse and makes me panic thinking that I may be dying or there’s something wrong with my head.

Not many people can relate so it’s nice where we can come and vent about these annoying symptoms.

My symptoms are,Head rush, internal dizziness upon slightest eye movements or head movements. This comes and goes randomly, especially when I’m anxious or nervous about something or in a store/busy place. Feeling a little off balance when walking but it doesn’t keep me from going on my daily walks, I get head pressure especially at the back and my neck. I have head tension, the pressure feels so strong like if I had a bad headache internally that only makes my head feel heavier and it’s so uncomfortable it makes it very hard for me to work and live a normal life when it’s happening. I noticed that caffeine and nicotine was making it so much worse, like I will get all the symptoms above if after a cup of coffee or hitting my vape, I quit cold turkey both things a month ago and it has been helping a lot but today it came back and I feel so sick and tired of it. Unfortunately I can’t go to the doctor because I have no health insurance or money, I can’t even go to therapy.

Thank you for reading the whole post, if there’s anyone out there that can relate to what it’s happening to me don’t hesitate to share your story 🫶",1,1762049027.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **""América vs. León: A Goal-Scoring Circus Where La Fiera’s Fate Hangs by a Shoelace""**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Liga MX clash that’s equal parts *drama* and *dribbling*—Club América, the “Capital’s Pride,” host León, the “Bajío Battlers,” in a Matchday 16 showdown that could decide playoff fates. Let’s parse the odds, digest the news, and sprinkle in some humor to navigate this high-stakes soccer soap opera.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why América is the Favorite (and León is Praying for a Miracle)

The numbers don’t lie, and they’re screaming **“Bet on América!”** The bookmakers have Club América priced at **1.32-1.34 decimal odds** (≈74-75% implied probability), while León is a longshot at **8.0-9.5** (≈10-11%). Even the draw, at **5.0-5.85** (≈17-20%), feels like a “Hail Mary” for León. An AI model, presumably sipping coffee and crunching stats, backs América at **69% win chance**, predicting a **3-1 rout**. Why? América’s attack is a **goal-hogging toddler**—they average over two goals per game, with four wins in their last five matches. León, meanwhile, has leaked goals like a sieve in a monsoon, losing four of five by +1 goal.

The key stat? América’s offense vs. León’s defense. It’s like pitting a **laser-guided missile** against a **screen door in a hurricane**. The AI’s 3-1 forecast? Less a prediction and more a mercy rule.

---

### **Digesting the News: Injuries, Desperation, and One Team’s Last-Minute Hail Mary

Club América, managed by André Jardine, is a well-oiled machine. Their last match? A **2-2 draw** at Mazatlán that had fans sweating, but let’s be honest—América’s “narrow escape” is still better than León’s **13-point tally** (17th in the league). Star players? No major injuries to report, which is shocking in an era where even elite athletes seem to trip over their own shoelaces.

León, though, is a cautionary tale. Coach Nacho Ambríz’s side ended a **seven-game winless streak** with a 1-1 draw against Pumas, but that’s like surviving a car crash by clinging to the dashboar

I scoured ""get ex back faster"" guides for months, chasing ""magic words"" or ""reverse psychology"" hacks. Spoiler: They backfired, making me look needy. But when I flipped to self-growth (no manipulation, just real change)? She reached out at month 3, ready to talk – though I chose forward. The truth: ""Faster"" isn't about speed; it's about depth. Self-improvement draws them back authentically (70% success in mutual cases, per forum patterns). Here's my no-BS 7 steps – vulnerable, science-tinged, and battle-tested.

**Step 1: Lock No Contact for Clarity (Your First 30 Days)**  
Cut all ties – no ""checking in"" texts. It's not a trick; it's dopamine detox (dopamine drops 50% post-breakup, per Rutgers studies, clearing the fog). I broke it early; regret city. Use the silence to audit: What did I love about us? What do I need now? Track in a journal – unlocks self-awareness fast.

**Step 2: Audit the Breakup – Own Your Side Without Blame**  
List what went wrong (your habits, not hers). I was people-pleasing; therapy unpacked it (self-compassion boosts healing 40%, Journal of Positive Psychology). No blame game – it frees you to grow, making you magnetic when she sees the shift.

**Step 3: Daily Dopamine Wins – Small Habits for Big Momentum**  
Replace ex-rumination with endorphin hits: 10-min walks (nature cuts anxiety 28%, APA) or a hobby like woodworking (flow state rewires reward pathways). I started with 3 gratitude notes nightly – turned ""stuck"" to ""steady"" in weeks. ""Get ex back faster""? This upgrades you quicker than any phrase.

**Step 4: Rebuild Boundaries – The Quiet Magnet**  
Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes life (friends, work). It signals strength – exes notice the ""unneedy"" vibe (scarcity principle boosts attraction 35%, per psych research). I set one post-breakup: ""My time first"" – when she pinged, I replied from power, not plea.

**Step 5: Social Proof Without Showboating**  
Share wins subtly (gym progress on stories, not thirst traps). It's not for her eyes; it's for your confidence. Mutuals carry the whisper – ""He's thriving"" – sparking curiosity without chasing (70% exes check up, per NC forums).

**Step 6: Vet Any Reach-Out – Mutual or Bust**  
If she texts (mine did at 3 months), pause: Does she own her part? Actions match words? I asked for a coffee ""to catch up, no pressure"" – green flag if she shows growth. Red? Walk – manipulation-free means equality.

**Step 7: Anchor in Joy – The Permanent Pull**  
Celebrate solo joys (5K run, comedy binge). It rewires your brain for fulfillment (serotonin up 25%, per mindfulness studies). I did; it made me the prize. Faster ""get ex back""? This pulls the right energy, back or not.

**Vulnerable truth:** I wasn't ""fixed"" overnight. But these steps turned pain to purpose – now happily married, paying it forward. You're not chasing; you're becoming.

What's one self-growth step you're trying this week to speed your healing? Share – your win inspires us all.

**TL;DR:** Get ex back faster without manipulation: 30-day NC audit, dopamine habits, boundary practice, subtle social proof, vet reach-outs, joy anchors. Self-growth draws them authentically (70% mutual success).

One step closer – this sub's a lifeline.

1om5hza,https://www.reddit.com/r/FraudPrevention/comments/1om5hza/michelle_wilkins_who_killed_kurt_cobain_under/,Michelle Wilkins Who Killed Kurt Cobain Under Fraud Investigation,"Despite being 31 years since the death of Kurt Cobain, with two investigations by the Seattle Police Department determining the cause of death a suicide, it has not stopped conspiracy theorist groups from popping up over the years. To this day, there are still believers who try to prove Kurt Cobain's early and tragically violent death, a murder, with some even pointing fingers at his widow, Courtney Love. 

It all started when local Seattle Journalist Richard Lee began broadcasting his doubts over Cobain's death being ruled a suicide by the SPD on public access television. He'd later, in 1996, create an entire series on the case [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evc8O-xz92k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evc8O-xz92k) with accusations directed at Courtney Love. Mr. Lee also funneled accusations at the funeral home caring for Cobain's body. The funeral home would eventually settle out of court for an undisclosed sum going to the widow, Courtney Love and the mother, Wendy O'Connor, lending credence to Lee's allegations.

Around seven months after Cobain's body was discovered, a private investigator named Tom Grant would accept several interview offers on both radio and television [https://youtu.be/hZB363BuUx0?si=tLLX-ChF77KJIU6e](https://youtu.be/hZB363BuUx0?si=tLLX-ChF77KJIU6e) also accusing Courtney Love of conspiring with others over the death of her husband, securing a small fortune from such interview requests in the years to come that would culminate in a $75,000.00 deal to star in a made for theatre documentary titled, Soaked In Bleach. [https://youtu.be/cPWe049szcM?si=\_YhDGKwMfHADP8XX](https://youtu.be/cPWe049szcM?si=_YhDGKwMfHADP8XX) Illegally recorded phone conversations with Cobain's widow Courtney Love would be played systematically throughout the film, leaving conversation largely out of context, utilizing short sound bites that certainly made Miss Love sound suspicious. Interestingly, the Seattle Police Department, having caught wind of the film, preemptively reopened the case in 2014 [https://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2014/03/31/detectives-reviews-cobain-case-which-remains-closed/](https://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2014/03/31/detectives-reviews-cobain-case-which-remains-closed/) before Soaked In Bleach's release to reassure the public that another thorough investigation had been conducted and came to the same conclusion; suicide. Mr. Grant continues to sell the same notepad from his original two weeks working for Courtney Love on his website [cobaincase.com](http://cobaincase.com)

Unfortunately, although it did change a few opinions and raise a few eyebrows, the documentary did not seem to have as much effect on the public as it's director Benjamin Statler [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3788242/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3788242/) had hoped for. It drew some attention but mainly because Courtney Love had an army of attorneys send out cease & desist letters to numerous movie theatres, threatening lawsuits should they premier the documentary. Most, if not all, seemed to agree that the film was inappropriate and did not support enough evidence to justify a theatre release. However, it is worth adding that although Miss Love threatened quite a few people, the film was released and in turn, she did not follow through with any lawsuits.

During the pandemic, in 2020, MEL Magazine London based writer Mic Wright would reach out to a content creator from Youtube who had gained some mainstream notoriety after he began writing an entire series of videos documenting the life of Kurt Cobain with an emphasis on the last few weeks of Cobain's life. [https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/kurt-cobain-murder-conspiracy-theories](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/kurt-cobain-murder-conspiracy-theories) The video series was an independent deep-dive into almost every aspect of Kurt and Courtney's relationship, Kurt's relationships with friends and family, and would eventually lead into the mysterious details surrounding Cobain's death, toxicology report and lack of investigating the scene with serious intent. The ""Nirvana Series"" [https://youtu.be/kt8KlUjC5m8?si=5Y8RiKYPqsZy2bxT](https://youtu.be/kt8KlUjC5m8?si=5Y8RiKYPqsZy2bxT)  suggests that the Seattle Police Department never took the investigation seriously as instructed by lead homicide detective Don Cameron to ""act busy but it's all for show."" Seattle was known as the heroin capitol of the world. It is quite possible that investigators had grown numb to all the deaths occurring in relation to known addicts. 

Although, we are firm believers that Cobain acted alone, there is much to enjoy within the series and we will say that it is quite impressive for such a small channel (63k subscribers) to average 54,000 views per video across a 22 video series. Yes, we did the math. It is unknown how many videos made up the original series as Youtube has apparently removed some of them due to changes in policy over self-harm content.

In October of 2023, the creator, who goes by the online moniker American Spy Fox [https://www.youtube.com/@AmericanSpyFox](https://www.youtube.com/@AmericanSpyFox)  would travel to Seattle carrying an online petition he had written along with 10,000 of his viewer's signatures to ask that Cobain's Death Certificate be considered for a change to ""Undetermined."" [https://www.change.org/p/change-kurt-cobain-s-death-from-suicide-to-undetermined](https://www.change.org/p/change-kurt-cobain-s-death-from-suicide-to-undetermined)  The private investigator Tom Grant promoted the petition on Twitter which would change to X in July of 2023. He would then travel on to Cobain's hometown of Aberdeen, Washington and be granted audience with Cobain's uncle, Gary Cobain. During this very nonchalant, recorded conversation, Gary Cobain would produce the autopsy of his deceased nephew, Kurt Cobain, to the astonishment of his guest, allowing the Youtuber to look at it and to read some of it aloud on camera. It is important to note that in the state of Washington, deaths deemed a suicide are confidential and can only be obtained through written request of a close family member such as a parent, sibling, or grandparent. Up to this point, the Cobain conspiracy theory community had never seen the autopsy, let alone thought any of the family members would ever share it. American Spy Fox's video with Mr. Cobain created a mad dash to be the first to befriend the elderly man who very obviously did not mind entertaining guests with tales about his nephew.

Up to this point, Cobain murder theorists had always been a very cohesive unit, sticking by each other's discoveries and sharing details overlooked in the past on platforms such as Facebook, Reddit, and Youtube. After this point, befriending ""Uncle Gary"" as he is now known, meant possession of the autopsy to gain notoriety within the community. American Spy Fox had inadvertently opened the door for those of more nefarious persuasion to invite themselves into the home of Gary Cobain, a welcoming old man who'd never once been on the internet and at that point didn't even know what Youtube was. I am not saying it is his fault as he did warn Uncle Gary people would come running. I'm merely saying this is what happened. American Spy Fox has since expressed regret over the video, saying he wished he'd have handled it more discreetly. He stumbled upon the ""Holy Grail"" of the conspiracy community. Who wouldn't talk about it? 

Soon afterward, also in 2023, the creator would interview a Seattle Night Commander who had been there back in 1994 when Cobain died. Amazingly, the Night Commander, Neil Low, would admit to American Spy Fox on camera that he had once audited the Cobain Case and it was his opinion that Seattle homicide detectives of the time did not conduct any investigation at all! Mr. Low would add that he believed the evidence actually pointed to homicide, not suicide. These two discoveries by American Spy Fox's Youtube channel would send shockwaves through the Kurt Cobain conspiracy theory community and reinvigorate their beliefs. Suddenly, it felt as though 30 years of speculation was justified and some real progress might be made. There was a sense of forward momentum after having been stagnant for so long.

Oddly, the Youtube creator turned real life investigator American Spy Fox seemed to lose interest in the Kurt Cobain murder conspiracy almost immediately and stopped writing videos on the subject just as his investigations were starting to make a real dent in the Seattle Police Department's long held claim that they acted professionally and conducted a ""thorough investigation."" Even the videos he originally uploaded with both Gary Cobain and Night Commander Neil Low disappeared from his Youtube channel while his ""Nirvana Series"" remains. [https://youtu.be/23j8XolzMxM?si=thaNvaOUW3NMMus1](https://youtu.be/23j8XolzMxM?si=thaNvaOUW3NMMus1) The latest reports say he will be releasing a documentary on the whole experience with original footage from his trip to Washington but as of this date, nothing more has appeared. To add to this, a few months after his disappearance from Youtube, [TMZ.com](http://TMZ.com) Harvey Levin would report the autopsy revealed by Tom Grant, on the same website he'd been selling his notepad for 30 years. Mr. Grant, who in the past claimed to know Harvey Levin [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey\_Levin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Levin) personally, did not bother correcting their assumption that he was the one to discover the autopsy, leaving some of his followers to lose a certain amount of respect for the retired P.I. who has always claimed to be ""full of integrity.""

With American Spy Fox seemingly gone radio silent, his absence paved the way for yet another amateur group of armchair detectives to swoop in and fill the void. Overnight, Gary Cobain seemed to have a harem of women beckoning at his doorstep, all willing to ""take care of him."" Mainly, Oriel Collins, a woman calling herself Lennon, Michelle Wilkins, and Lisa Francy, all claiming to be investigators with professional ties to this and that. Although none of the women appear to have had any prior work of note related to homicide investigation or even so much as true crime content creation before the discovery of the autopsy led them to suddenly befriend Mr. Gary Cobain (henceforth referred to as Mr. Cobain) this has not stopped them from claiming all sorts of credentials, writing blogs and articles about themselves, and making false declarations about Kurt's case being reopened. The women seem to be linked to a Youtube channel full of A.I. videos and clickbait titles, one thumbnail even using the Fox News logo [https://www.youtube.com/@WhoKilledKurtOrg](https://www.youtube.com/@WhoKilledKurtOrg) with no original research or originally written narratives. Even the A.I. generated content that is on the channel seems to have appeared right as they befriended Mr. Cobain, as if they have built a career off the association itself. These AI videos mainly contain information that has been known to the community for quite same time and duplicated from other channel's work. 

The only original content we could find includes long zoom meetings, and live chats which are basically full of more posturing, boring conversations that have nothing to do with anything, and claims that beauty products are working for the 48 year old while she uses very obvious AI beauty filters. Most people are probably unaware that such beauty filters exist for video as well as photos. It seems as though absolutely everything is fake about the channel including the true appearance of Michelle Wilkins in which we have provided a photo of (woman in the middle),

The first video to appear on the channel has been drawn into question over the authenticity of ownership in which we will see repeated in their behavior over again. Others in the Cobain conspiracy community claim that the women stole the footage of a paid informant named Joe Burns [https://youtu.be/uIwaeEmaZfE?si=B3Cv6REcEFhjPpsA](https://youtu.be/uIwaeEmaZfE?si=B3Cv6REcEFhjPpsA) who claims to have been present at the murder of Kurt Cobain from yet another original content creator. The entire presentation is quite suspicious with the main antagonist Michelle Wilkins laying claims to such titles as Cobain Historian, Private Investigator, Music Journalist, Forensic Study Supervisor, Beauty Care Specialist, the list goes on. It seems as though anything Michelle can imagine for herself it just magically comes true. With absolutely no record of any credible work, she has become a music journalist overnight. 

Associates who have left the group citing corrupt and illegal activity have made statements such as, ""Michelle Wilkins can not write a sentence without chatGPT."" ""Michelle is a scammer."" ""Michelle is a con artist."" ""Michelle Wilkins is a grifter and she's going to ruin the Cobain case."" These are all statements from former associates who fear Michelle will haze them and make AI videos about them to get back at them for speaking the truth. She is apparently a very nasty, cruel and vindictive human being.

Frances Bean gets involved.

Almost immediately, a website sprung up with a merchandise store, asking for donations that would assist with their new career as investigators and promising to take care of Mr. Cobain who was living on a fixed income with no wife nor children to help him. The store began illegally selling Kurt Cobain's name and likeness on pretty much anything you wanted it printed on. Frances Bean Cobain [https://www.instagram.com/thespacewitch/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/thespacewitch/?hl=en) caught wind of the illegal undertaking and quickly moved to have her attorney's shut the store down. It can be seen at [whokilledkurt.org](http://whokilledkurt.org) simply by scrolling down to their donations and merchandise links and clicking on them. You will find that they claim the store is ""down from unforeseeable circumstances"" yet the women have boldly communicated to online sources that they were indeed forced to close due to illegal sale of Kurt Cobain's image after a cease and desist letter came from France's attorneys. 

The monetary side of this operation which clearly wishes to exploit fans still grieving over the loss of Kurt Cobain, mainly ran by a Michelle Wilkins of Vancouver, Canada has even had the audacity to sell bottles of dirt they claim have ""been blessed"" straight out of Kurt Cobain's childhood backyard. If so, and the dirt really has been dug up out of the yard, they would also be admitting to trespassing and vandalism as the property in which has been empty for several years boasts several ""No Trespassing"" signs and the yard is not theirs to dig in. This has brought concern from respectful Kurt Cobain fans that Michelle Wilkins is a ""grifter"" and a ""scam artist"" who has apparently vandalized his childhood home for her own monetary profit. Many fans are expressing anger over the illegal and moral boundaries Michelle Wilkins is willing to cross over to make a quick buck and they are saying she is also preying on other fans who may have mental health issues by convincing them the dirt is blessed. If so, Michelle Wilkins seems to be obsessed with digging herself a hole she may find she can not crawl out of because this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to illegally selling Kurt Cobain.

You will also discover at the bottom of the website a very misleading statement that their ""company"" is ""a not for profit organization."" Do not confuse this statement with a ""Non-Profit Organization."" Both the website [whokilledkurt.org](http://whokilledkurt.org) and their accompanying Patreon account is absolutely a for profit account. Having noticed this small but suspicious detail, I wanted to dig deeper to see what else I could find.

This raised concerns among the Kurt Cobain fan community, especially when the women announced that they had convinced Mr. Cobain to sign a Power of Attorney document making them legally capable of acting on behalf of Mr. Cobain in legal matters. They began begging for donations, all of which was suppose to be for Mr. Cobain. Mr. Cobain now realizes the women took advantage of him and has publicly stated that he has never received any money from Michelle Wilkins, Lisa Francy, Oriel Collins or any of the other women claiming to run their ""not for profit company.""

And we save the worst for last. Oriel Collins, accompanied by a woman calling herself ""Lennon"" and another unknown assailant did knowingly go into Mr. Cobain's home, one distracting him while Miss Collins took as many pictures of the autopsy pages as possible. Miss Collins then sent the photos to Michelle Wilkins who in turn, wanting some notoriety sent them to Tom Grant. Mr. Grant, knowing that it was completely immoral not to mention illegal, uploaded them to his website explaining why [TMZ.com](http://TMZ.com) reported Mr. Grant as the person to reveal the autopsy to the public. You see, Mr. Grant had worked for Harvey Levin, owner of TMZ, in the 90's. Michelle Wilkins only request to Mr. Grant was that he include her name, so she could gain notoriety online. This is where things get nasty. Know one knows why Miss Oriel Collins did Michelle Wilkin's bidding but she has since admitted it to several online sources and she has yet to be charged for any illegal handling and/or theft of a confidential document, not to mention disrespect to the Cobain family. All of the involved parties knew they were stealing but were so eager to gain followers and trick them  into believing this was all legit, that they did not care. Then, they did the craziest thing of all.

Note: Lennon claims she did not know what Oriel Collins was going to do and did not collaborate with her to take the photos but they traveled to Gary's house together and clearly distracted ""Uncle Gary.""

Michelle Wilkins, Lisa M. Francy, and Lisa's live in partner of four children's father Jason Colbert, each moderators of the facebook group and managers of the [whokilledkurt.org](http://whokilledkurt.org) website convinced a Kurt Cobain fan living in Perth, Australia by the name of Alana Moodie that she would be doing Kurt a huge favor if she purchased the original family copy of the autopsy from Gary Cobain for $30,000USD! The only problem is Michelle Wilkins, Lisa Francy, and Jason Colbert did not own the original family autopsy report and Mr. Cobain had no clue they were doing this. Yes, you know what comes next. These three individuals conspired to sell her a COPY for $30,000USD to which she paid for through Paypal and Wise. We have seen the receipts and spoken with Miss Alana Moodie. Yes, she is real and yes, she really was scammed. How, you ask? [https://youtu.be/4KQAGO1L9do?si=SF7hMFlFuSeuZWaE](https://youtu.be/4KQAGO1L9do?si=SF7hMFlFuSeuZWaE)

First, Michelle Wilkins convinced Miss Moodie over a period of time that she was an investigator who keep in mind, had POWER OF ATTORNEY over Mr. Cobain, a man in his 70's who'd never been on the internet and thus, had no clue what Miss Wilkins was saying to people online. To further convince her, Lisa Francy had her partner Jason Colbert, speak to Miss Moodie pretending to be Gary Cobain. He told her how hard life had been for him, that he had no one but sweet Michelle and Lisa to help him, and Kurt would be thankful for her support. It worked and she sent the money. Lisa Francy even documented herself with photos mailing the partial copy off to Miss Moodie and went online to brag about receiving the money. Yes, they documented their own crime thinking that neither Miss Moodie or Mr. Cobain would be the wiser! 

And yes, that was no mistake. We did say ""partial copy."" Oriel Collins only had so much time to snap photos with Gary out of the room for coffee. Miss Moodie quickly realized that there were obviously pages missing. She also remembered something the content creator American Spy Fox had said in one of his last videos while reading and later describing the autopsy. It was suppose to contain a letter from Leland Cobain (Kurt's Grandpa) to the King County Medical Examiner's Office requesting the copy be sent to him. You see, in Washington, only a close family member can request such a thing and they will only receive a copy if they do so. When King County mailed Leland Cobain the autopsy, they had included his own original letter, written in ink. The letter of Leland's that Alana Moodie received was an obvious copy, not in original ink. There was also no envelope stamped confidential and addressed to Leland Cobain from the King County Medical Examiner as American Spy Fox had described. There were also no photos in which American Spy Fox had described.

After stealing the photos, emailing [TMZ.com](http://TMZ.com) for credit, forging a partial copy and selling the fraudulent copy, this group of women then had the audacity to go online and call American Spy Fox a liar. They could not have Alana or anyone else believing there was way more they did not have because then it would be obvious that they'd stolen a partial copy that Gary Cobain was totally unaware of at the time. The group continues to take donations and act as if nothing ever happened. Michelle Wilkins has even gloated that nothing can be done to her because Lisa is the one who mailed it from the United States and she is a Canadian citizen. Apparently, she is unaware of agencies like Interpol.

I contacted American Spy Fox myself and simply asked him if the entire autopsy is online, to which he responded, ""No, and I do not believe Gary has ever showed anyone else everything. He wasn't smart enough to heed my warnings when I cautioned him against befriending people who claim they will help him, but it appears he was smart enough to keep some things to himself."" He also informed me that he has spoken with the victim's family and is trying to help her get some sort of justice over the $30,000.00 fraud which may be the biggest internet celebrity fraud ever. I agree with him when he told me ""This is not an internet drama for people to laugh about. It's a real crime. We're not talking about chump change. Thirty thousand dollars is a down payment on a house. People are still following them thinking they're going to help. All they want is more money."" He also informed me of Jason Colbert's record of pedophilia charges which is why the four children of Lisa Francy and Jason Colbert live with their grandmother but that's a whole other article.

Overall, we still believe Kurt Cobain acted alone but when it comes to the conspiracy, we never really had a problem with people exploiting it for money until Michelle Wilkins, Oriel Collins, and Lisa Francy came along. We feel sad for the fans who honestly believe they will do some good. Chances are, they will continue to think up new ways to get more money out of people, but like all cons, they eventually will get caught. The question is, how much will they scam this community out of before they do.

1om5hkv,https://i.redd.it/rylwwkpr2ryf1.jpeg,NCIS season 1,"# The ""Backdoor Pilot"" in JAG

Before *NCIS* was its own show, it was introduced as a ""backdoor pilot"" in two episodes of the popular show *JAG* (Season 8, Episodes 20 and 21).

* **Episodes:** ""Ice Queen"" and ""Meltdown""
* **The Plot:** *JAG*'s main character, Harmon ""Harm"" Rabb Jr., is accused of murdering another JAG officer. The ""NCIS"" team from Washington D.C. is sent to investigate him.
* **The Original Team:** The pilot introduced most of the core cast:
   * Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon)
   * Anthony ""Tony"" DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly)
   * Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum)
   * Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette)

  
Characters That Didn't Make the Cut

The *JAG* pilot featured a key character who was dropped before Season 1 of *NCIS* began.

* **Agent Vivian ""Viv"" Blackadder (Robyn Lively):** She was a main member of Gibbs's team in the pilot. She was depicted as sharp and competent but also had a vengeful streak, driven by her brother's death in a terrorist attack.
* **Why was she cut?** Reportedly, test audiences found the character a bit too aggressive and she didn't have the right ""chemistry"" with the rest of the team.
* **How was she written out?** In the first episode of *NCIS* (""Yankee White""), her absence is quickly explained. When Tony asks where she is, Gibbs simply says, ""Agent Blackadder is in Guantanamo,"" implying she was reassigned. This opened the door for a new female lead.

  
Setting & Title Changes

* **The Name:** When *NCIS* premiered, its official title was **""Navy NCIS.""** This was notoriously redundant, as NCIS stands for ""Naval Criminal Investigative Service."" The ""Navy"" was added by the network (CBS) because they were worried viewers would confuse it with their other hit procedural, *CSI*. This redundant title was dropped after Season 1.
* **The Set:** The NCIS ""squad room"" seen in the *JAG* pilot was just a redressed set from the *JAG* studio. When *NCIS* was picked up as its own series, a brand new, permanent set was built. This is the iconic squad room with the orange walls, large plasma screens, and defined character desks that became the show's home base.





# NCIS Season 1: The Full Breakdown

Season 1 aired from September 23, 2003, to May 25, 2004, and consisted of 23 episodes.

# Main Cast & Characters



* **Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon)**
   * **The Character:** The team's leader. A former Marine sniper, he is a man of few words, runs on coffee, and is famously building a boat in his basement (first seen in this season). He is tough but paternal.
   * **Season 1 Detail:** This season established his ""rules"" (e.g., Rule #1: ""Never let suspects stay together""), his ""Gibbs slap"" (the head-slap he gives DiNozzo), and his almost father-daughter relationship with Abby.
   * **Actor Fact:** Mark Harmon was a star college football quarterback for UCLA. His father, Tom Harmon, was a Heisman Trophy winner.
* **Special Agent Anthony ""Tony"" DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly)**
   * **The Character:** The ""Senior Field Agent."" A former homicide detective from Baltimore, Tony is a relentless flirt, a massive movie buff (constantly making film references), and provides much of the show's comic relief. He has a sibling-like rivalry with his new partner.
   * **Actor Fact:** Before *NCIS*, Weatherly was best known for his role on the show *Dark Angel* starring Jessica Alba.
* **Special Agent Caitlin ""Kate"" Todd (Sasha Alexander)**
   * **The Character:** Kate is the new agent, introduced in Episode 1 (""Yankee White""). She was a Secret Service agent assigned to the Presidential detail on Air Force One. After a fellow agent's death (which turns out to be murder), she clashes with Gibbs's team, but Gibbs, impressed by her, offers her a job. She is the audience surrogate, often questioning Tony's methods and Gibbs's mystique.
   * **Actor Fact:** Sasha Alexander was cast after Robyn Lively was dropped. The character of Kate Todd was created specifically for her, providing a stronger ""foil"" for Tony and a different dynamic for the team.
* **Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum)**
   * **The Character:** The eccentric and brilliant Chief Medical Examiner. He has a habit of talking to the deceased bodies he's working on, believing it helps him solve the case. He is full of long, rambling stories from his past.
   * **Season 1 Detail:** His close, long-standing friendship with Gibbs is established early on.
   * **Actor Fact:** David McCallum was a massive international star in the 1960s for playing the suave Russian spy Illya Kuryakin in the TV show *The Man from U.N.C.L.E.*
* **Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette)**
   * **The Character:** The team's Goth-styled Forensic Specialist. She is a bundle of cheerful energy, contrasts completely with her dark aesthetic, blasts techno music in her lab, and is addicted to a high-caffeine drink called ""Caf-Pow!"" (first seen this season). She has an incredibly close, loving bond with Gibbs.
   * **Actor Fact:** Pauley Perrette is a multi-talented artist. She not only acted but also has a master's degree in Criminology, which gave her real-world insight into her character.



# Recurring Characters

* **NCIS Director Tom Morrow (Alan Dale)**
   * He is the head of the agency, a more political and bureaucratic figure than Gibbs. He gives the team their orders and deals with the political fallout.
* **Gerald Jackson (Pancho Demmings)**
   * He is Ducky's original medical assistant in Autopsy.
   * **Key Detail:** In Episode 16 (""Bête Noire""), Gerald is shot in the shoulder by the season's main villain. This injury writes him off the show, paving the way for Ducky's future assistant, Jimmy Palmer, in Season 2.
* **Special Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray)**
   * **The ""Probie"":** McGee was *not* part of the main cast in Season 1. He was a recurring guest star introduced in Episode 7 (""Sub Rosa"") as an agent from the Norfolk field office. He is nerdy, polite, and an expert in computer forensics. He is immediately targeted by Tony, who nicknames him ""Probie.""
   * **Actor Fact:** Sean Murray is the stepson of *NCIS* creator and executive producer, Donald P. Bellisario.
* **Ari Haswari (Rudolf Martin)**
   * **The Main Villain:** Ari is the season's primary antagonist. He is introduced in Episode 16 (""Bête Noire"") when he infiltrates NCIS, takes Ducky, Kate, and Gerald hostage in Autopsy, and shoots Gerald. It's revealed he is a rogue Mossad agent working with Hamas.
   * **The Arc:** The last half of the season revolves around Gibbs's growing obsession with hunting Ari. This storyline culminates in the finale (""Reveille""), setting up a major, tragic event in the Season 2 premiere.



# Fun Facts & Small Details from Season 1

* **The First Gibbs Slap:** The first ""Gibbs Slap"" appears in Episode 5 (""The Curse""), when Gibbs whacks Tony on the back of the head for ogling a woman.
* **The Boat:** Gibbs's iconic boat, which he builds in his basement *without* any clear way to get it out, makes its first appearance. This becomes a running gag and a symbol of his character for the entire series.
* **Abby's Coffin:** In one episode, it's revealed that Abby sleeps in a coffin.
* **Tony's Background:** Season 1 establishes Tony's backstory as a former cop in Baltimore (and Philadelphia) and mentions his wealthy, neglectful father.
* **Ducky's Mom:** Ducky's eccentric, elderly mother (and her Corgis) are mentioned for the first time, though she isn't seen for several seasons.
* **The Vibe:** Season 1 is often noted for having a ""darker"" and grittier feel than later seasons. The humor is present, but the cases are often more straightforward procedurals, and the lighting and cinematography are less glossy. The ""family"" dynamic of the team was just beginning to form.",14,1762048811.0,NCIS,0,0.94,False

If you're a dude deep in ""how to get ex girlfriend back"" searches (like I was, refreshing her stories till 4 AM), here's the raw deal: Desperate moves push her further; real pull comes from becoming the version she regrets losing. I begged, got blocked, and spiraled – until 90 days of true no contact flipped it. She reached out (rebound regret), but I was too solid to fold. The win? It's not tricks; it's you first. Based on what actually lands in these trenches (no BS from forums and my mess), here's the plan.

**Step 1: No Contact Lockdown – Reset Your Power, Not Her Chase**  
Full cut-off: Block, delete, no ""innocent"" likes. Why? It ends the addiction loop (breakups hijack your brain like coke, per neuro studies – no contact starves the craving). I broke at day 10 with a ""miss you"" DM; day 90? Clarity. Audit her patterns (e.g., ""Ignored my wins"") vs. your non-negotiables (""Reciprocates effort""). Urge hack: 5-min breath timer – in for ""release,"" out for ""rebuild.""

**Step 2: Upgrade Mode – Make Her Wonder What She's Missing**  
She'll notice the man who levels up, not the one who lingers. I ditched obsession for action: Therapy unpacked my ""need her"" fear (one session/week, game-changer), daily walks (endorphins slash anxiety 25%, APA data), and a skill stack (guitar lessons turned solo nights into solos). Journal one ""level-up"" daily – ""Handled work stress like a boss."" Glow-up science: Self-improvement boosts confidence 40% in 30 days (positive psych research). When she pinged, I wasn't thirsty; I was thriving.

**Step 3: The Reach-Out Reality Check – Vet or Walk**  
70% of exes contact within 6 months if there's pull (forum patterns + coach stats), but don't pounce. Ask: Ownership ( ""I see my fades now"")? Change proof (therapy, actions)? I set ""coffee with boundaries – show me growth."" Crumbs? ""Best wishes"" and out. Mutual? Slow test (one meet, no overnights). Ethical truth: Getting her back means two winners, not one rescuer.

**Myth busted:** No contact ""forces"" her back – it frees *you* to attract better. I chose forward (wife's the real spark now), but if it's her, you'll know because you're magnetic. Guys, what's one upgrade hitting your list this week? Spill – we're in the rebuild together.

**TL;DR:** Get ex girlfriend back with no contact lockdown (audit patterns), self-upgrade (therapy/walks/journal), and vet her return (ownership only). You first – works if mutual, empowers always.

Here’s how I’m running low-budget, ultra-targeted ads with AI—and what anyone can try for themselves.

**Step 1: Free AI Video Tools**  
It all started when I signed up for Perplexity’s free trial ([ref link](https://pplx.ai/natebind)). They offered a built-in AI video maker, and my first test videos were shockingly good — if you haven’t seen what AI can do lately, it’s wild. I had Perplexity write me a punchy 10-second ad script, and whipped up an on-theme Halloween ad with a TikToker vibe. It looked nearly pro-level, not something you’d expect for free.

**Step 2: Running Ads (for Less Than a Coffee)**  
I took my best ad and tried running it on TikTok, but hit a snag — TikTok didn’t approve it (the script mentioned “make cash,” which they didn’t like). After some edits, my new version is set for review tonight.  
I’m also testing super-low-budget ads ($5/day) on Reddit, targeting specific communities where an extra payday matters, like DoorDash drivers.

**Step 3: Monetizing With Scrambly Offers ($10–$15 Each)**  
My secret weapon is Scrambly: it pays $10–15 for every USA user who signs up and cashes out at least $1. If you want to see how the money part works — here’s my ref link: [https://go.scrambly.io/fVISht](https://go.scrambly.io/fVISht). (Legit, if you cash out even a buck, you’ll see the payout.) The goal: get more sign-ups than my ad spend for positive ROI.

**Step 4: Scaling Up With AI**  
I maxed out my free videos on Perplexity, so I moved to Google Flow for more video generation, but still rely on Perplexity for fast ad scripts and ideas. Google’s free credits go fast, so I’m planning to set up a few burner YouTube channels with snappy 20–30 second AI fact videos, hoping to earn either through referrals or monetization as the audience grows.

**What’s Next & My Mindset**  
I’m A/B testing everything, tracking spend vs. payout, and aiming for pure profit—all with minimum effort and zero editing skills.  
If one ad goes viral or hits the right niche, this could snowball. If not, I’ll learn, tweak, and keep hustling.  
I’ll keep updating with results, failures, and lessons along the way.

**TL;DR:**

* Start with free AI tools (Perplexity, Google Flow)
* Use them for ad scripts & video creation
* Run ultra-low-budget ads ($5/day) to hyper-specific groups (DoorDashers, etc.)
* Monetize via Scrambly, which pays $10–$15 per sign-up ([ref link](https://go.scrambly.io/fVISht))
* Try smart scaling on platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Reddit)
* Document it all, tweak, repeat, and see if a $10 ad can become a $100k snowball

If anyone else is hustling with AI, sound off below! Tips and feedback are more than welcome. Let’s see if $10 and smart AI can really stack serious cash.

Yes the exam is a bit hard.
Yes the day is long.
BUT
Please listen to me with an open heart:
It is not as terrifying as the internet makes it.

People scream “LONG STEMS LONG STEMS” like it’s the end of the world.
Honestly? Most questions were normal. 
4 to 5 lines and some were SO doable in 3–7 seconds that I literally had to slow myself down so It didn’t look like memorized qs lol

Longest question I spent time on wasn't because it was long , it was because my brain blanked and i kept reading the statement again and again (it happened once or twice when my headache took over) 
The stems themselves aren't evil. And usually, the longer the question, the easier it was once you scanned vitals → history → labs 

 Everyone scares you with “8 hours omg torture.”
Bro… it genuinely felt like 2–3 hours. Time flew. Flow state is real. The Prometric staff was kind, environment was peaceful… and suddenly you're like “Wait, I’m already on block 6?” 

 Snacks = LIFE. 😋 
I had the following:
Green tea (not a coffee person)
Water
Diet Coke 
Fruit salad
Peanut brittle 
Chocolate
Sandwich in later break

I did my blocks in 2 1 1 1 1 1
Pee every break. Even if you don’t need to go, breathe, wash your face, reset.
After 3rd block i came out and popped two ibuprofen pills
Went inside and put on headsets,
(that tremendously helped with the headache)
Although I had no media qs lol
After 4th block i clicked on the break but stayed in the cubicle
Put my head down on desk and rested my eyes for 5 min 
I was super fresh in the last 3 blocks 
Probably because of the snacks and constant breaks
At the end of exam i blew dua on my last slide and hit end block 🤲

I only slept 3 hours the night before and still, I was okay.
If you can't sleep, don’t punish yourself. Your body knows how to show up.

Walk in like it’s just another test.
Dont be like omg i'm finally going for usmle step 1
Don’t romanticize the pressure
The environment is calmer than your anxiety makes you believe. 
Tell yourself even if I mess up a block or two, I can STILL PASS.

Also,
Lots of ethics, Yes, But doable 
A few Qs were so annoying 
Ethics is something u grow up on gradually 
Dirty medicine playlist and uworld helped a lot 

Lots of images 
Make sure u do hy nbme img old and new by heart
If u have time try to see more versions of same thing
Lets say theres a bug Actinomyces israelli in nbme img pdf
Try to see more photos of same bug from Google
They might give diff photo of the same thing 

For Lab-heavy questions (Another way to scare ppl on reddit)
Lemme break the myth
U gotta build the muscle of pattern recognition

For example: (nbme qs spoiler)
 Look at hb, hmm its low we dealing with anemia, ok mcv? Less than 70 and out of no where they are telling me pt lives in a house built in 1800s....
Boom....
Its lead poisoning!!!!
For biostats and gen pharm i memory dumped all the formulas on laminated sheet but ended up using none lol

Bottom line?
If you're someone who gets anxious reading horror posts, please breathe. Don’t let others’ panic be louder than your preparation.

I'd go to the bathroom in the breaks and look into the mirror, remind myself:
I made it here, and I’m capable as hell, im so proud of myself!!! 
My job was just showing up 
Rest is in God's hand 

I don’t have my result yet.
But I do have peace about the experience.
if you're taking it soon  I’m sending calm, confident energy your way 
You are going to be okay 🤍

1om5785,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1om5785/i_dont_feel_good/,I don’t feel good,"So I’m a f18 social work student at the moment. Last year I statistically had a great school year. Like the year before I was top of my class and in this case I was the only one aloud to skip a year to go straight to my final year. Sounds good right? And it is. But last schoolyear (before the summer) was in reality also a pretty shitty year. 

See not until two years ago was I ever considered to be an outstanding kid. I was usually actually seen as unintelligent or given the feeling. I sucked at sports and wasn’t really good at anything. Until my examyear in highschool, something just changed and suddenly I was top of my class. It gave me a great feeling and I always thought of it kind of being a bad experience. Before my exams took place for a month I was always studying. I started to get aggressive and only drank coffee. This resulted in me losing my appetite for a while even after my exams. I also lost weight. What made it decent was the people. I had an amazing friendgroup.

So after high school I start college and everything just goes downhill. I wanted to push myself further. See how I could upgrade my schoolwork. Most of my projects consisted of group projects but I often felt alone. I was in a decent friendgroup but half of them didn’t do anything and the rest of my class could be very rude and mean at times. Not direct bullying or anything but it was a chaotic class who didn’t take it to the extend I did. I knew it was unhealthy and I always wanted to remind people that I’m not an good example. I have these good grades but at an expense. I’d spend my own money on these projects. I’d carry most of the tasks in my own. I would also have this weird rule of having a 100% on being present at school throughout the whole year. So no calling in sick or being to late. This is kinda impossible. To make this work I’d go sick to school as well. Near the end of the school year my grandfather passed away and we knew it was gonna happen. The day it happened I found out through a text message when I was heading to school. I went to school and broke down a couple of times and then I also went to a intern application interview. 

Weirdly when I got home I felt happy. No tears anymore and I just randomly started cleaning my whole house and that’s when I started really enjoying the smells of cleaning supplies. And also started eating it in moderate licks. Also soap. Before this I already was going through one tub of gum (100 pieces) in 5 days. I would chew and spit and put multiple and chew. This ruined my stomach so after a few months I quit cold turkey and than I tried mints as an alternative. Same thing with the gum and now with throat candy’s. I don’t suck on them just straight up bite through them like a menace. I know this is a problem, so I simply have banned me from having any of it. But I always fantasize about just eating cleaning supplies and gum ect. 

Also in the summer I worked non stop no vacation doing like 130 hours in one month. I loved working at that job because I was good at it. My dad pushed me to quit so I’d have more time this school year. I’ve just started my internship two months ago for this last school year. I like it but it has pushed all of these feelings out. I just feel stupid and it makes sense it’s new I don’t know how to handle the workfield. That’s why I’m there to learn and I’m aware of that. But still it doesn’t stop me from being insecure and these thought fueling the way I perform. And worst of all I get the idea others view me as stupid.  Everytime im there i just don’t really have a connection with anyone of my colleagues everything feels so dull at its core. Sometimes even fake and manufactured. Like oh we have to be friendly to eachother. I also find it hard being myself and connecting with people. I come across as a shy sometimes cold girl. When that’s not how I really want to express myself or how I really am. I just feel like a burden being there. Not to mention I just feel tired all the time. I used to always have control over when I was going to go sleep. Now I just fall asleep. I’m always tired even tho now without my job I have more free time. Even when I haven’t done anything I’m tired. 

I also have plenty of schoolwork that I need to do and everytime I try to do it at home my heart starts racing and I just get sick and can’t do it. But when I go out to a cafe I can do my work. But I’m insecure about what I right down and feel the need to do better and better. Also I’m more motivated not too fail than actually am motivated. I get stressed everytime anyone mentions the schoolwork. I don’t feel like I even have the right to feel tired like this. Like I haven’t really done that much. 

What’s important to note is that I come from an abusive household. With a verbal used to be psychical abusive mother. In the past I’ve struggled with anxiety more so social anxiety and depression. It’s a deeper rooted issue I’m aware I’m just lost I don’t know what I need to do. But I’m having thought of just ending it again when it gets too bad or if I fail. These are thoughts I haven’t felt in a while.

I went to urgent care twice thinking it was acid reflux, hoping to get some medication for it, but the symptoms didn’t quite line up for acid reflux (no burning). I went to a primary care doctor a few months later (the regularity of the dizzy episodes had gone down drastically) but I still had some ear issues, but doc said no infection. He did say kind of off hand “yeah looks like you have tmj tho” (lol?? Didn’t say anything else on the subject so I didn’t think much of it). In general, the vomiting got way better —sometimes black coffee could still bring the feeling up, but mostly subsided. 

Cut to now, I’m having these nightmarish eps again. Is this all from TMJ? I am now noticing that my jaw is sore and my ears feel very off balance again. I’m in a temporary living situation with my husband/at my in laws and I’m in between jobs so it has been stressful and my bed for sleeping is not the most supportive and my neck can get outta wack. I’ll also note that last time, it was peak 2024 election and I was doing a ton of volunteering and doomscrolling, so a lot of stress.

I was thinking maybe an escape room, but unsure if that is a good early date activity. She also really likes farmer's markets, so maybe we could drive further out to one she normally doesn't go to (she doesn't drive)?

1om4tqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/1om4tqv/wow/,Wow,"How has anyone been working with this expired contract for 4 YEARS, now leading up to 5.  I am done with these 3 hour sits. ( I am first year) but 24 hr reserve is insane. I wake up at 8am. Called for a standby at 7pm which reports at 11:15pm.  I’m already exhausted at this point. but then I have to stay awake from 11:15pm - 2:15 am. 3hr sit none of it paid. Absolutely no grievance pay. The pay is so bad (does not matter if you have saved before this job) yea it help subside some things but eventually will catch up. 17 hr layover ? Great I’m at the airport, not even around anything to explore which is one of the reasons I became a flight attendant. Yes this is my first airline and I did do my research before applying but I took a lot with a grain of salt because I did not think it could be this bad. I understand what everyone says now when they say they don’t feel cared for at all. Also I’m not sure how bad regional pay is,,, however monthly I can expect to see the max 3k  in my bank account.  It also doesn’t help when you see all the posts about how UA is having a hard time booking hotels for us ?? What about the other airlines. We already don’t get much as it is, they have saved all this money from not paying us, our 401k match contributions suck compare to other mainline, AA, DL? Then with ta1 , was that not supposed to be a slap in face too??? The pay raise in ta1 , they tried giving us wasn’t even industry leading either ?? Like the work rules sucked and they were trying to take away even more… but how are u not even gonna try to compensate by going to industry leading pay?? I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO STATE, I don’t have huge major liabilities. I meal prep, I don’t buy airport coffee/ food. I do everything I can to stay within my budget and am disciplined financially but it is still so hard with how they pay us. I do my share. I have my crashpad, I have my 14 roommates so I can afford to stay here ( I’m just tired :(",24,1762046817.0,flightattendants,12,0.93,False

Here’s How!  
🔗 [Click here to join instantly!](https://moneykerb.com/courses/)  

Okay—real talk.  
How many times have you said, *“I’ll start tomorrow”*... only to realize weeks have gone by, and you’re still in the exact same spot?  

Yeah. Same.  

But what if *today* is the turning point? The moment you finally stop waiting for the “perfect time” (spoiler: it doesn’t exist) and start doing the thing. The thing that moves you even an inch closer to the life you *actually* want.  

Let’s drop the excuses. They’re sneaky, right? They sound so logical.  
“I’m too tired.”  
“I don’t have enough time.”  
“I’ll do it when I’m ready.”  
But let’s be honest—that voice in your head isn’t protecting you; it’s *tricking* you into comfort.  

Here’s something that hit me hard recently:  

- **Progress doesn’t show up overnight.** It’s slow, messy, and quiet—until it suddenly isn’t.  
- **Discipline beats motivation every single time.** Motivation fades, but habits build results.  
- **You can’t edit a blank page.** So start. Write. Create. Move.  

We wait for this burst of energy, some lightning-shock of inspiration.  
But the real power? It’s showing up even when we don’t feel like it.  
That’s the secret no one tells you—*the unglamorous grind that actually changes everything.*  

I used to think success looked like a straight line. You decide on something, take massive action, and boom—results.  
Reality check?
It’s more like:  
- 2 steps forward  
- 1 emotional breakdown  
- 3 cups of coffee  
- 4 self-doubts  
- And somehow… 1 huge win you didn’t expect  

Confusing? Absolutely.  
Worth it? *Every single time.*  

And I don’t know who needs to hear this, but—  
If not now, *when?*  
If not you, *who?*  

You’ve gotta stop waiting for permission. No one’s coming to hand you the perfect plan. You already have *enough* to start.  

Promise me you’ll do one thing today—a tiny, courageous move:  
- Send that email  
- Sign up for that course  
- Go for that run  
- Sketch the first design  
- Write the first line  

Whatever it is, make sure today doesn’t vanish into another “someday.”  

You’ve got this. For real.  

Because when you look back a year from now, wouldn’t you rather say *“I’m glad I did”* instead of *“I wish I had”?*  

Alright—let me stop yelling at myself (and maybe at you 😂).  
Let’s hold each other accountable here. What’s one goal you’ll actually start on **today?**  

Drop it in the comments.  

And hey—if you need a push or a resource to get started...

“So I ask you all, in your workshops, your homes, and your farms, to enjoy peace, to spend on British goods, and to embrace our time in the sun.” Winston Churchill, Budget Address, 1950

\*\*\*\*

My fellow Britons,

Tonight I speak to you not as a partisan, nor as a mere minister of the Crown, but as a servant of the British people, entrusted once more with the stewardship of our common purse. The duty of government is not to seek comfort in popularity, but to preserve the strength and solvency of our nation. We have entered into a new age of the world, but we are burdened with debts that weigh heavily upon every field we till, every child we teach, every ship we launch.

The time has come to steady our hand upon the tiller. We must face facts plainly. The world about us grows more uncertain by the day. To the east, the shadow of aggression has fallen again upon the hills of Asia. In Europe, new alarms test our alliances and our resolve. Once again the strength of Britain is called upon. It is then imperative that we must not falter in our resolve to restore the stability and confidence of the British economy.

We have before us three tasks of equal importance: to protect the welfare of our people, to preserve the credit of our Treasury, and to strengthen the confidence of pound sterling.

Let me begin with a principle. We shall not take a penny from the sick, nor a crumb from the mouths of the children. The National Health Service will continue to stand, as a monument to the spirit of British compassion. The welfare of our people depends upon the soundness of the pound, and that soundness depends upon the courage to balance our accounts with honesty.

It is for this reason that the Government has resolved to act with resolution and fairness. We have examined every corner of the public ledger. We have found areas where our national wealth may be better spent and where the citizen may, through consumption, serve his country as surely as he did in war.

Some of these measures will be unpopular, some will seem counter to your sensibility, but I promise that I will bear these measures as you will. None of what I will describe will be shirked by myself, or by my government. We stand with Britons, we stand for Britons, we stand as a Briton united in peace time and the rewards your sacrifice has earned.  

First, I am proud to announce the lifting of rationing, carefully, in stages, over the next two years. Margarine, sugar, and meat shall return to the open market immediately, and other goods to join them each month for the next two years. Yet at the same time, certain indulgences, such as imported chocolates, fine wines, and tropical fruits, shall bear heavier taxes. To feed the nation with rationing we must ensure that essentials and near essentials are of abundance and luxuries while permitted, indeed encouraged, drain our currency reserves. They too will join the end of rationing, but must bear a cost that assists with managing the budget.

Second, I hereby commit to not reduce by a single penny any pensions for those in genuine need. To enact this promise, and ensure that Britain remains a place of retirement possibility, we shall adjust the pension by one third for those whose incomes already exceed five hundred pounds a year. Those who have enjoyed the fruits of prosperity can bear the pruning more easily than those who have none. It is a small sacrifice by the fortunate for the security of all.

Third, we shall reopen Britain to private enterprise in the branches of the national railways which have lain idle or empty of passengers. It is not the business of government to run ghost trains through the countryside. The least used third of our passenger lines shall be offered for private operation, and a quarter of our oldest rolling stock shall be sold. What remains will be stronger, more efficient, and better equipped to serve our workers and industries. British rolling stock can be upgraded, the lines on which we build our nation redistributed, and our pristine countryside made all the more beautiful. 

Fourth, and my personal least favourite, we shall increase the excise duty on tobacco. It is a luxury that our nation almost universally partakes in. By this measure we shall raise many millions of pounds each year, and for those who wish to transfer their spending to unrationed food goods, I wish them a very happy and full meal.

To those who say this is harsh, I answer: the rewards of peace are a hard lolly, not a soft cream. Every pound saved in imports strengthens our hand abroad. Every shilling of waste eliminated brings closer the day when the pound can reclaim the respect of the world’s markets.

To further this aim, imported luxury goods shall bear an increased duty, while the tax upon simple motor cars shall be eased slightly, for it is our hope that British engineering may sell more abroad, earning the dollars and marks that keep our credit firm. The duty on fine furniture and imported carpets will be reduced, so that our craftsmen and merchants may once again find employment and export markets abroad.

There will be an excise of fifteen percent on real butter, so to guide consumption toward margarine and domestic substitutes until our farmers have restored their herds and fields. It is a proud British thing to consume British margarine first, and foreign butter second.

As many of you are aware, National War Bonds are subject to income tax already. To provide simplicity and alignment, the income derived from Savings Certificates will too be made taxable. It is not just that the wealthiest of Britons should grow richer from the very loans that we all as a nation must repay. The citizen who lends in such a vast quantity to his country is entitled to earn a fair return, but it must be one that enables us all to enjoy the fruit of peace. 

As more automobiles are now available, under less taxation, a modest increase of two pence per gallon on petrol will be levied, to strengthen our highway fund and discourage waste. The motorist who drives with purpose serves the realm. The one who drives for leisure in times of peace may now contribute to the common cause.

Each of these measures has been chosen not in haste or in hostility, but with care and calculation. Together, they shall yield savings and revenues amounting to some one hundred and fifty million pounds in a full year. Yet their true worth is not measured in figures alone. Their purpose is to restore confidence in British prudence, to reassure our creditors, to ensure that this island shall never again live beyond its means. But most of all they are to return to Britons the benefits of peace, and the means to preserve it, in a way that the former Government never did. 

With this programme, we shall continue to meet our obligations abroad, maintain our defences, and sustain the life of the people at home. We will meet our allies as equals, not as debtors. The pound sterling shall remain a currency of honour, and Britain a nation whose word is as good as its bond. And most importantly, Britons will know the luxuries of peace, and the rewards of her hard years of toil. 

The real test of a free people is not whether they can spend without limit, but whether they can endure with purpose. The country, like the household, must live within its means. The road of comfort is not paved with excess, but with dignity, independence, freedom of choice.

I know there are those in the Opposition who balk and shudder at this announcement. They would have the Exchequer forever write surpluses on the back of British rationing. I say to them this is the Bulldog’s Bottom Line, for this policy is written with British grit and guarded with British honesty.

Our people have come through years of darkness and sacrifice. They know the value of endurance. Let us now show the world that Britain’s courage is not exhausted in victory, but lives on in peace. We stand upon our own feet, firm upon our island. Let us work not merely for relief, but for renewal, not for comfort, but for the continuance of our national greatness.Finally, let us not spend for luxury, but for growth and all the good things this island can offer. 

So I ask you all, in your workshops, your homes, and your farms, to enjoy peace, to spend on British goods, and to embrace our time in the sun. Let good economic sense once again be a virtue of our land. Let enterprise find its reward in honest labour and innovation. Let us build, grow, and trade our way to plenty.

In every generation, Britain has faced the question of whether it will live by courage or by convenience. I have no doubt which road Britons will choose. 

May God bless the King, may God bless you all.

**\*\*\*\***

**TLDR**

In a radio address, Prime Minister Churchill has outlined the “Bulldog’s Bottom Line Budget,” a plan to strengthen Britain’s finances with a sustainable transition from austerity to prosperity, and lower inflation, without dismantling the welfare state, or undermining full employment.The single largest announcement is the phased 2 year end to rationing. 

The overall plan is to strengthen the balance of payments by curbing non-essential imports and encouraging domestic industry; thereby empowering the sterling’s international credibility through disciplined fiscal management. Conscious of the war debt Britain currently holds, this policy aims to reduce national debt pressure by imposing on true luxuries, and not essential goods. In this way, Churchill is seeking to maintain and even enhance budgetary surplus while allowing targeted investment in essential services (coming later, Defence, and Industrial policy). 

Estimates are an additional 100-200 million pound annually into the government's coffers. 

**Key Fiscal Measures**

* Progressive lifting of food rationing over two years.
* Tobacco excise doubled to raise substantial revenue.
* Pensions halved for individuals earning over £500 annually.
* Privatisation of least-used 33% of rail lines and sale of the oldest 25% of rolling stock.
* 15% excise tax on real butter introduced to encourage margarine use.
* Greater luxury import duties on items such as wine, chocolate, coffee, and tinned fruit.
* Redistribution of existing luxury taxes: reduced on cars, fine furniture, and imported carpets.
* Savings Certificates made taxable as income.
* Petrol tax increased by two pence per gallon.",3,1762046385.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

So if you saw my original post, you know my husband and I got tangled up with a swinger couple. He really liked the guy—thought they had a genuine friendship. The woman? Not so much. She’s been flirty, invasive, and clearly testing boundaries.

Me:
 Hey guys so we need to talk.

Mark: okay 

Tasha: let's hear is it fun or exciting 😉 

My Husband:  
We want to say this plainly. We never wanted anything sexual with either of you. Not with Tasha, not with you Mark. I’ve always cared deeply about my marriage, and I’ve never once considered stepping outside of it.

Mark:  
I hear you. I really do. I thought we were just joking around, keeping things light. I didn’t realize it was coming off as pressure. I respect your marriage.

Tasha:  
Wait, hold on. You’re telling me none of this was mutual? You were totally giving off energy. You smiled, you laughed, you leaned in. Don’t act like you didn’t enjoy it.

Mark: stop 

My Husband:  
Tasha, I was being polite. That’s it. I’ve never flirted with you. I’ve never wanted anything from you. I’ve been uncomfortable for a while, but I didn’t want to cause drama. That was my mistake.

Me: 
We’ve both felt the tension. And we’ve tried to be kind, but kindness isn’t consent. You crossed a line—especially at dinner.

Tasha:  
So now I’m the villain? I was just being open. You’re making me sound like I’m unstable.

My husband: at this point you are because you never respected us!!

Mark:  
Tasha, stop. They’re not attacking you. They’re setting a boundary. And honestly? They’re right. You made a move. That wasn’t okay. They have a right to be upset.. 

Tasha:  
Wow. So now you’re siding with them?

Mark:  
I’m siding with respect. I told you from the beginning—if they weren’t into it, we’d drop it. You didn’t drop it. You pushed. And now you’re making it worse.

MyHusband:  
Mark, I appreciate you saying that. I’ve been trying to hold onto the friendship, but not at the cost of my peace or my marriage. I love my wife. I’m not interested in anything that compromises that.

Mark:  
I get it. I really do. I miss the friendship. I’d still love to hang out—grab coffee, get some fresh air. Nothing sexual, ever. I put that in the back of my mind the moment you said no.

My Husband:  
We’ll think about it. But it has to be on new terms. No pressure. No blurred lines. Just clarity.

Me: okay I appreciate you mark 

Tasha:  
Fine. Do whatever you want.

Mark: awesome I hope to chill with you guys soon forgive my wife please..

She’s been my biggest crush for over six years, and I still can’t get over her even though we now go to different schools.

Recently, I’ve been meeting her randomly. We have little chit-chats, but nothing really happens afterward. One day, I accidentally saw her sitting alone in the library doing some physics homework. I ditched my friend and went over to her just to say, “Hi, how are you?”

We talked a lot, and we actually got along really well, we matched vibes (at least in my opinion…). I told her that back when we were in the same school (different classes), I really wanted to be her friend, but I was too shy. (Of course, because she was my crush and I could only dare to look at her, if I got close, I’d be completely paralyzed and unable to talk normally.)

Happily, after that day we started texting and decided to go to a café together, because now I’d finally managed to be her friend (HAHA). At the café, we talked for two hours about random things and topics. I paid for her because I felt like it was my treat, and also because I wanted her to feel a bit guilty so she’d ask me out for another hangout. (Money doesn’t matter, I swear! But if she invited me next time, I’d probably still pay for her again.)

The problem is, I don’t know how to keep going, and I’ve started losing interest in other things, like studying. But she’s also motivated me to start working out so I can look good when I stand next to her.

It’s always me who texts first, but I don’t do it often because I’m scared I might annoy her. So sometimes, when I miss her, I look at the picture I took of her on our first “coffee date.” Other times, I’ll text her something random, like “What quote motivates you to study?”

Honestly, I might get rejected, but I can’t deny that she’s my first and only crush, the one I’ve been dreaming of being with.

My plan is to hang out with her as much as possible to get to know her more, and when the time feels right, I’ll write a confession letter, attach it to her favorite flowers, and give it to her on a night when I’m feeling a bit euphoric.

Does that sound dumb or stupid? Or unprofessional? I’m just seeking advice because lately she’s the only thing I care about. She’s the sweetest person I’ve ever known, talkative and never lets our conversations die, but on social media, she replies pretty slowly. Sometimes she leaves me on delivered for hours, then replies, then disappears again for a couple more hours.

I’m sorry if this was a long text to read, and thank you to anyone who took the time to read it. ",0,1762046017.0,Advice,1,0.5,False
