( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Your Active Retirement starts now ✈️ (Seriously, bundling flights & hotels saved us a fortune!)","**You Might Be Richer Than You Think (But Are You Using Your Money Right?)**

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the truth: **most of us are sitting on way more financial power than we realize**—we’re just not using it the right way.

Think about it:
- That $500 in your savings account? It’s not just ""emergency cash""—it’s a seed that could grow into something bigger.
- The spare change you ignore? It’s not ""pocket lint money""—it’s fuel for your future.
- The ""I’ll start investing later"" mindset? That’s the real thief of your wealth.

**Here’s the kicker:** You don’t need a windfall to build real financial freedom. You just need to *redirect what you already have*.

### **3 Ways You’re Probably Wasting Your Money (Without Even Knowing It)**
1. **Letting Cash Sit Idle** – If your savings are just chilling in a basic account, inflation is eating it alive. Even a high-yield account or low-risk investment could turn that stagnant cash into a growing asset.
2. **Overpaying for Convenience** – That $10 daily coffee? It’s not just $10—it’s $3,650 a year (plus the compound interest you could’ve earned). Small leaks sink big ships.
3. **Waiting for ""Perfect Timing""** – The best time to start investing was yesterday. The second-best time? **Right now.**

### **The Simple Shift That Changes Everything**
What if you took just **$20 a week**—the cost of a pizza—and put it into something that grows? Over 10 years, even at a modest 7% return, that’s **$14,000+**. Not bad for skipping a few takeout nights, right?

The real question isn’t *""How much do I have?""* It’s **""What am I doing with it?""** Start small, stay consistent, and watch how your money starts working *for* you—not the other way around.

But then she was all dressed up with make up and perfume with a small hand bag and not a backpack. She gave me a hug too.

Then we went to a book club / coffee shop and i might be delusional but her eyes were NOT platonic eye contacts. Then i bought us coffee and i thought she still wanted to go buy her running shows (that was her original plan for mlk day before i asked her out) but then she was like “we can do anything, just talk or walk around”

So i took her to this light show and we walked around and held hands (😊) and she never seemed to mind. Our convos were never short of laughters. Now my hands smell like hers (sorry)

The kind of crew that’s seen each other through breakups, job losses, all that crap. I love ‘em, but damn, sometimes it feels like I’m on the outside looking in, and it’s all because of this stupid secret I’ve been carrying around like a brick in my chest.

I (32M) am 6’5 and built in a way that people are quick to assume I am nothing but a big body and nothing more, it’s awkward as hell when you try to blend in with the rest of the world around you lol.

I work as a Massage Therapist which is rewarding because I have the unique privilege of helping people release stress and I am an outlet for them to talk about their problems and just create a safe space for them and it’s wonderful. It’s rewarding but it also makes me constantly think about vulnerability you know? People open up on my table in ways they don’t elsewhere, it’s comfortable for them.

Well a couple years back, I got out of a serious relationship because my girl at the time said I was “emotionally distant” and that was a gut punch from hell. This caused me to pick up reading as an outlet and try to sort my shit out and work on a better me.

My reading started as your typical “self help” books. But not long after, I fell down a deep rabbit hole that is the world of Dark Romance. You know..the smutty kind. The ones with raw, edgy power struggles that mess with your head. It was safe to say I was instantly hooked.

Now here I am present day, a big ass build of a man walking into little coffee shops when I need a breather with a latte in one hand and Haunting Adeline in the other. These stories have found a way to crack a man like me open by making me feel seen in a way nothing or no one else does.

But I must admit, keeping this side of me hidden sucks. My friends, the ones I’ve known forever, would never let me hear the end of it if they knew this was what I read in my free time or wanted to talk about or even bounce ideas and thoughts off of.

Sadly it sucks putting on the tough act with friends, hiding my books at the coffee shop and just putting that part of me to the side.

The worst part of all this is that I know deep down these stories are escapism with no shame attached.

But hiding this makes me bitter, having me ask myself why I can’t just own this side of me without the judgment. My friends will never understand how much this change has helped me grow.

It’s wrecked my sense of belonging and it really sucks to have no one in my corner talk to about these books and take me seriously.",1,1768883525.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,1.0,False
1qhrayp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhrayp,Please help me stop hating this living room!!,"For some reason I hate this room right now. I looked at these curtains for MONTHS and absolutely had to have them. I couldn’t fathom buying different curtains. I ended up getting them as a present. Now they’re here and I’ve been living with them for 2 months and they’re pissing me off. It’s too much and they block even more sunlight than my shades already do (had to have those too, I apparently did not appreciate the natural sunlight we used to get). I can’t keep buying things with this kind of record. I feel like the curtains are too warm with the floor? 

OH and my child puked on my rug so that’s gone now. The warm windows + warm toned floor + wood coffee table is just so much blah. I’m wondering if just getting a new rug will help? I don’t even know what rug to get!! Or do I need to move these curtains to a different room and start from scratch?

Btw our home is not very large and we have two small kids so that’s why the toys are front and center (and they don’t bother me, I love having a family friendly space front and center).

I don’t know what my style is. I like eclectic cottage vibes. I also like antiques and MCM. Just cozy, pops of fun, bold colors mixed with neutrals. I’m just saying words I don’t even know anymore. 

The living room is also connected to our bedroom so it feels like there needs to be a good flow since the bedroom is usually visible. Right now it’s very simple with just the wood furniture (mix between MCM and antiques) and white bedding with a small pop of floral and stripes. The green curtains are my favorite shade of green and I have to actively work at not buying every single thing in that color. I struggle so there’s a lot of it because I love it so much.

1qhraud,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qhraud/ms_check_riverside/,[MS] Check Riverside,"*A public defender finds a note in her own handwriting—\*Check Riverside surveillance\*—in the file of a client who took a plea deal four months ago. She doesn't remember writing it, doesn't remember following up, and doesn't know if forgetting was exhaustion or self-preservation. Now she has to decide whether caring about a closed case when she has sixty-three open ones is conscience or just another kind of failure.*

*-*

The note is in her handwriting but she doesn't remember writing it. \*Check Riverside surveillance—J says cameras face loading dock.\* The file it's tucked into is Marcus Webb's, but Marcus Webb took eighteen months four months ago, and she hasn't thought about him since.

She sits with the Tupperware balanced on her knee, engine running, and tries to remember. Marcus Webb. Possession with intent. Third strike looking at him so he took the deal. She'd had—what, fifteen minutes with him? Twenty? He'd been quiet. They were all quiet or they were loud, and she'd learned to work with both, but the quiet ones were easier because they usually just took what you told them to take.

Her phone buzzes. Her sister: \*Did you ask him yet?\*

She deletes it without responding.

The thing about the note is she can picture writing it. She can picture Marcus saying something about cameras, about how they'd see he was nowhere near the actual deal, just walking through. She can picture herself writing it down because that's what you do when a client tells you something, you write it down so they feel heard. And then what? Then twenty other clients and four other court dates and someone's mother crying in the hallway and the prosecutor offering eighteen months instead of five years and Marcus saying okay, saying he just wanted it done.

She closes the file. Opens it again. Her handwriting, definitely. The J would be—she checks the notes—Jamal Porter, codefendant, took a deal the same day.

It's 4:47. She has a 5:30 drinks thing with law school friends she's been trying to cancel all week but can't because Sarah just made partner and you have to show up for that. She needs to go home and change. She needs to not be wearing the same suit she wore yesterday, which she is, because the cleaners closed before she could get there and anyway it's $40 she doesn't want to spend before her sister's bachelorette weekend in Scottsdale.

\*Just tell Mom you're bringing someone. She doesn't need to meet him before the wedding. Just a name.\*

She starts typing a response, deletes it. Starts again: \*I'm not making up a fake boyfriend for your wedding.\* Deletes it. The truth is she'd consider it. The truth is she's thought about asking David from the DA's office if he'd do it for $200 and free drinks, as a joke, except she's thought about it enough times that it isn't quite a joke anymore.

The file sits on her passenger seat.

Here's what checking the surveillance would mean: calling in a favor from someone at the PD's office to pull archived footage. Maybe two, three hours of her time. Probably nothing on the cameras. Probably they don't face the right way or the footage is taped over or it shows exactly what the police report says it shows. And if it doesn't—if it shows Marcus walking through, wrong place wrong time—then what? Then a motion to withdraw the plea. Then Marcus sitting in county for another six months while it winds through. Then maybe nothing anyway because maybe the footage isn't clear enough, isn't definitive, and prosecutors don't just roll over because you have a grainy video.

Then her supervisor asking why she's spending time on a closed case when she has sixty-three open ones.

She eats another bite of rice. It's cold and the soy sauce didn't distribute evenly so this bite is too salty. She'd made it Sunday night, meal prep, trying to save money for Scottsdale. Four identical Tupperwares of rice and broccoli and chicken. This is number three. Tomorrow is number four, and then she'll buy lunch Friday because by Friday she'll want to die if she sees another piece of steamed broccoli.

Her phone: \*Mom's going to ask. I'm just warning you.\*

She types: \*Tell her I'm bringing someone.\*

Three dots. Three dots. \*WHO?\*

\*You'll meet him there.\*

She puts the phone face-down and immediately regrets it. Now she has to produce someone or admit she lied, and admitting she lied is somehow worse than just showing up alone, which was the original problem.

The file. Marcus Webb. She'd told him eighteen months was good. She'd meant it. Eighteen months instead of five years was good, was a win, was the best she was going to do for him in a system designed to process people as quickly as possible through the narrowest possible channels.

She tries to remember his face and can only remember his hands. He'd kept them flat on the table between them, very still, while she explained the deal. Long fingers. A scar across the knuckles of his left hand.

Probably there's nothing on the surveillance.

Probably she wrote the note and then checked and there was nothing and that's why she didn't remember—because it had been nothing, a dead end, the kind of thing you follow up on and dismiss twenty times a day.

Probably.

She could call Jamal Porter's lawyer. See if they ever looked into it. Except Jamal Porter's lawyer was Keith Ventura, and Keith Ventura retired in January and moved to New Mexico to make furniture or find himself or whatever it is burned-out public defenders do when they finally get out.

4:53.

If she leaves now she can go home, change, make it to drinks on time. She can be the person who shows up for Sarah. She can have two drinks, not three, and talk about Sarah's new office and her new salary and not think about how Sarah makes in a month what she makes in a year, because Sarah went corporate and she didn't, which was a choice, which was supposed to mean something.

She puts the car in reverse.

Stops.

The thing is, she'd been tired that week. Marcus Webb's week. She remembers that. There'd been something—what? A trial. A stupid trial on a shoplifting case because the client wouldn't take the deal and insisted she was innocent, which maybe she was, but they lost anyway because of course they did. Three days of trial on a $47 shoplifting charge. And she'd come out of that and had a dozen plea deals to process and Marcus had been one of them.

She'd been tired.

She's always tired.

She puts the car back in park and pulls out her phone. Scrolls to find Andre's number—Andre who works in records, who she bought coffee for when his kid was in the hospital. The favor economy. Everything runs on it.

The phone rings twice.

""This is Andre.""

""Hey, it's Lisa Sorenson. You got a minute?""

""For you? Maybe thirty seconds. I'm walking out.""

""I need surveillance footage pulled. Four months old. Might be nothing.""

Silence. Then: ""Closed case?""

""Yeah.""

""Lisa.""

""I know.""

""You got sixty, seventy files right now?""

""Sixty-three.""

""And you're chasing something from four months ago.""

She watches a pigeon land on the hood of the car in front of her, peck at something invisible. ""There's a note. In my handwriting. I don't remember following up.""

""So maybe you did and it was nothing.""

""Maybe.""

The pigeon flies away.

""What's the case number?"" Andre says, and she loves him for it, for not making her ask twice.

She gives him the information. He says he'll see what he can do, maybe tomorrow, maybe Monday. She thanks him. Hangs up.

4:58.

She should feel better, having made the call. She doesn't feel better.

Her phone lights up: \*What's his name?\*

She looks at the phone. At the file. At the parking garage's concrete ceiling with its water stains and exposed pipes.

She types: \*Marcus,\* then deletes it.

She types: \*I'll tell you later,\* and sends it before she can think better of it.

Then she puts the car in reverse, and this time she leaves, and the file stays on the passenger seat, and she doesn't know yet if Andre will find anything, and she doesn't know if she wants him to, and these both feel like the same kind of failure but she can't articulate why.

The drinks thing is in Georgetown. She hits traffic on Constitution. She'll be late. She's always late. Sarah will forgive her because Sarah forgives everything, which somehow makes it worse.

At a red light, she picks up her phone and scrolls through her contacts. Gets as far as David (DA's office) before the light changes. Puts the phone down.

The file slides forward when she brakes, and she pushes it back.

Eighteen months. Marcus Webb is eight months in, ten to go with good behavior. Probably he's fine. Probably he's adjusted. Probably reopening everything would just mean more time inside waiting for a hearing that wouldn't change anything.

Probably she should let it be nothing.

The thing about being a public defender is you learn to let things be nothing. You have to. Otherwise you'd never sleep. Otherwise you'd drown in all the ways you can't save people, all the corners you have to cut, all the notes you write and forget because remembering would mean caring and caring about every single thing would turn you inside out.

She parks three blocks away because Georgetown parking is impossible. Checks her face in the mirror. Puts on lipstick. Takes it off. Puts it on again.

Her phone: \*Marcus what? Mom's going to want a last name.\*

She sits in the car and tries to think of a last name that isn't Webb.

Comes up empty.

Sends: \*You'll meet him at the wedding,\* and gets out of the car, and walks toward the bar where Sarah is celebrating, and the file is locked in her trunk now, and Andre will call or he won't, and she'll deal with it or she won't, and for now she's just a woman walking into a bar to have drinks with friends, to be happy for someone else's success, to be a person who shows up.

Just finished a lean bulk, now cutting back down. I tend to eat the same thing everyday because that's what I love.

My day consists of:

Breakfast, 5 a.m.: 

1) 226g (2 servings) of 96% lean beef w/ 60g Sugar free BBQ sauce.
Calories: 300
2) 72g (1.5 servings)Rolled Oats in water w/ 30ml sugar free syrup & 14g chopped walnuts.
Calories: 370

Meal 2, 8:30 a.m.:(1.5 hours pre-workout)

2 Bananas
Calories:200-240

Meal 3, 12:00 p.m.(Post workput)

1) 226g (2 servings) of 96% lean beef w/ 60g
Sugar free BBQ sauce.
Calories: 300
2) 48g (1 serving)Rolled Oats in water w/ 15ml sugar free syrup.
Calories: 190

Meal 4, 3-4 p.m.

Ninja creami Protein ice cream(1 pint), 1 scoop Vanilla protein powder, 14oz Almond Milk, 1 TBS Vanilla sugar free pudding mix.
Calories: 200

Meal 5, 6-7 p.m.

Ninja creami Protein ice cream(1 pint), 1 scoop Choc protein powder, 14oz Almond Milk, 1 TBS Chocolate sugar free pudding mix, 1 TBS Cocoa powder
Calories: 250

Meal 6, 8:30-9:30 p.m.

Ninja creami Protein ice cream(1 pint), 1 scoop Vanilla protein powder, 14oz Almond Milk, 1 TBS Salted Caramel sugar free pudding mix.
Calories: 220

Misc Calories during the day:

3x Coffee, sugar free Creamer only, or black
Calories: 40-60

Protein: 195g
Fat: 30-35g
Sodium: 1200-1500mg
Carbs: 150-160
Calories: 2100

Water intake is targeted for 8-10× 16.9oz bottles.
All I drink is Coffee & Water.

Supplements are:
Creatine 5g
Magnesium
Generic Multi-Vitamin

You'll probably laugh at the 3x pints of protein ice cream, but I urge you to try it lol. 

I prep my beef on Friday, takes an hour to cook and package 10 lbs, lasts perfectly until prep day again.

Please let me know if I'm overlooking something. I wonder if weighing my beef cooked vs uncooked skews the calories? FYI I cook it with no seasoning, no oils, and I thoroughly drain it, press it, rinse it then press again. It's dry of fat by the end, maybe the calories are lower than the package label 140 per serving by doing that? 

This may seem boring, but every meal I eat I absolutely love, I am a creature of habit. Love consistency. It gets better the longer I stick with it. I do vary my sauces.

The Ninja creami was a Christmas present, and it's amazing, love that thing.

Again this is a cutting diet, my clean bulk was about 2800 calories a day. The transition was quite easy. My water weight dropped within 2 days of switching, down from 194 to 186(mostly water from higher carbs previously), now 184 at end of first full week on this routine.

These foods we're present during the whole bulk as well, just more volume and some rice & chicken. More nuts.

I'm looking to upgrade to a mid-range grinder and there seems to be some decent deals on used/open box/returned products (returned used <30 days). Ideal budget is up to $700 CAD.

Some of the grinders I'm looking at include a returned EM Silenzio 55 (comes with 1 year warranty) and a used grind by time Allground (3-4 years use). Another one not mentioned in the title would be a Mahlkonig x54. My primary use would be espresso/lattes, but I'm filter coffee curious and looking for input from those with experience with either of these machines. I won't be single dosing.

Some general questions/thoughts in no particular order: Am I taking a risk buying used outside warranty? Is 64mm burr overkill for me being so new to espresso?

She has 2 children similar in age to my oldest, one younger and one older. A few months after meeting Leah, she invited my family and I to kid #2's birthday. A couple months later, Kid #1's birthday arrived. Leah asked if I'd be able to come 3 hours early to help with decorations. I was heavily pregnant at the time and had morning sickness all day, but I went anyway. I spent hours setting up for this party. A few months after Kid #1's party, my oldest had their birthday. I invited Leah, and let her know we were keeping it pretty small, just her 2 kids and a handful of others. She had to be out of town, but she said she'd let her husband know. 2 days before my child's party, Leah's husband confirms that he will be there with both children. Day of the party arrives, and I'm getting my kid ready. The time comes for them to arrive, and Leah's husband and children are nowhere to be seen. I send him a quick text, and he immediately replies with ""Oh, sorry. We came down with something."" 

My heart broke for my kid who was really looking forward to seeing Kid 1 & 2, but he played with the other kids and forgot about it. After that, I feel like Leah doesn't actually care about my child or our friendship. I notice she is harsh on my kid at play dates. She shows up to a park meet up late with a coffee for herself and pastries for her kids, when I have always brought enough for everyone or at least offered to pick some up. Leah then goes to a concert with a mutual friend (more hers than mine) and proceeds to send me a picture of the two of them at the concert. It feels a bit like she's making a point to show me she's there but didn't invite me.

Fast forward the last couple months, Kid 2's party arrives. We have a month long vacation coming up that we leave for 2 days after Kid 2's party. I tell her we have to miss it, because we don't want to be sick for our trip. And now, the conversation posted is in reference to Kid 1's birthday that's coming up. I have no issue with my oldest not going to his party, nor did I even think about if Kid 1 was having a party until she said that. It felt unnecessarily mean to text that we aren't invited out of the blue. I don't even know how we would have found out if she didn't say anything.

1qhr59i,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1qhr59i/im_trying_to_define_my_personal_philosophy_about/,"I’m trying to define my personal philosophy about free will and destiny. I think I might be compatibilist, but I’m not sure. The academic definition of compatibilism is difficult to follow.","When it comes to free will and destiny, I believe in two things: determinism and process/systems theory. 

(Btw please let me know if I’m using these terms incorrectly. I’m an anthropological archaeologist, not a philosopher, but I’m eager to learn!)

I believe that our reality is a gradual unfolding of events, a process, the ever-occurring “becoming” that Whitehead describes. I also believe that we exist in an infinitely complex system that extends back to the Big Bang, or whatever event led to the creation of our present reality. Taken together, this means that we’re all participants within an intricate, universal system, and each being with agency has the ability to steer the direction of this constantly unfolding system. We do this by making choices. 

However, here is where destiny comes into play: reality is deterministic in that the present moment could not have occurred any other way. What does this mean? Within this universal system, individuals make choices, but they’re based on variables within the environment—variables that are both known and unknown. We do not have complete control over these variables. We might be able to influence their development up unto that moment, but once the present moment invites us to make a choice, those variables are what we’re presented with. Nothing else. 

For example, take sodium. It’s an essential element we need in order to literally think. Neurons don’t fire without sodium ions playing out a delicate balancing act within the brain. Society tells us to avoid sodium (table salt) but we actually need it in order to function. Everyone needs a different amount depending on genetics etc, and even this amount changes each day. The way to determine how much sodium you need without lab work is simple—just listen to your body. You can sense when you need sodium if you’re attentive, just as you can sense if you have too much. I won’t go into the details of how this is possible since it’s a long discussion, but it IS possible, even if it’s a learned skill. So getting back to the point, sodium is important for thinking and making decisions. But society is telling us to avoid it. Therefore, it can’t be your fault if you make a poor decision because you were raised avoiding the necessary element. Only, you aren’t aware that this is the reason you made a poor decision. If you’d happened to have had enough salt that day, maybe you would’ve made a better decision. But this is out of your control. This is determinism, destiny, or the lack of free will.

Now consider this: you actually know about sodium’s importance in the brain. In fact, you know a lot about nutrition and how it can affect your ability to make “good” choices. But you actively choose not to monitor your diet. So now, when you make a poor choice, is it your fault? You had the information that would allow you to make a better choice. It might be your fault, but there were an infinite number of other variables that led to you having a sub-optimal diet, some of which were out of your control. 

So you see, the system we exist in is complex and choices are nuanced. But it’s also deterministic. Once you’re presented with the opportunity to make a decision, the choice you make is entirely dependent on the information and the variables you have available to you. You can’t change the past. All you can do is use your knowledge of the past to help you make predictions about the future. 

Now here’s where compatibilism comes into play. 

When you’re given the opportunity to make a decision, you’re presented with multiple options. You make predictions about the future to weigh each option. Will I enjoy tea or coffee more today? Will postponing this make me happier or just overwhelm me later? We envision each consequence of our actions before we choose to act. Sometimes this is a conscious process, sometimes it’s subconscious. But we’re still making a choice. Even my dog makes decisions. I can hold out two treats to him, one in each hand, and he’ll go back and forth smelling them until he decides which one he wants. What factors determine his decision, I have no idea, but in that moment he has agency. Did I decide which treats to buy and present to him? Yes. Would he have preferred to ransack the pet store and eat everything in sight? Also yes. I stole some of his agency from him. I became a limiting factor in his environment, a variable out of his control. But in the end, he decided the treat in my left hand was better for some reason and ate it. 

I suppose I believe that we have limited agency. Our present reality is determined, but we can try to control it in a few ways by making predictions in the present moment using information from the past. 

Is this compatibilism? 

Thanks in advance!

1qhr3og,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qhr3og/i_gave_too_much_too_early_in_dating_im_done/,"I gave too much too early in dating, I'm done","I \[27M\] spent most of my adult life over investing early on in dating:

* Organize all the dates and activities
* Pay for the dates and for the ubers
* Give my time, investment, attention and energy
* Give meaningful gifts or flowers sometimes

all within 1-4 dates of seeing the person, and without ever asking for sex in return, just to clarify. I just did it for passion and romance. Essentially, I put myself in this performance role without being explicitly asked.

  
I'm sick of this, and I want to stop.

  
I realized today that I have had it all upside down. All of this is great for a settled relationships where there are clear boundaries and there is no ambiguity, but for early courtship it's just stupid and unecessary.

  
My reasoning has always been that this was the norm for the better part of humanity, and women love men who display these qualities, so I kept on doing it. Men display their capacity to protect, provide, love, etc. It's part of the courtship social script, and I find it valuable.

But the key is that the modern dating scene is nothing like it was before:

* Exclusivity is no longer assumed by default
* People have multiple parallel options at all times (dating apps for instance)
* Choice for women is no longer constrained
* Boundaries are ambiguous

Why the fk am I operating my dating strategy on old principles when they make little sense in the modern dating scene?

What inevitably happens is that the girl I'm dating goes out with someone else (male 'friend' or otherwise) and my neurological system goes in overdrive ""how could she do this to me after all the time, attention, and ressources that I have invested in her?"". It's insanely annoying. Obviously, I don't want to enforce exclusivity after a few dates, so this is bound to happen.

I have a hard time just doing low-effort coffee dates, or to split the bill, because I feel like I come off as a low-value and low-investment man which I am not, so I'm a bit blocked in that regards, but this has to stop at all cost. It's especially stupid since honestly, I have options, I'm not doing this out of scarcity. No more early investment.

1qhr362,https://i.redd.it/r1hjv2gvjfeg1.jpeg,"My Boyfriend’s Friends Took Me Behind His Back… They Gangr&ped Me Raw While He Slept Inches Away, Talking Dirty the Whole Time","I was 19, dating Rohan for over a year. He was always gentle, whispering sweet things, never rough. His three best friends—Asif, Zaid, and Imran—were the opposite: tall, rough, with that heavy, commanding presence. They always threw filthy looks my way when Rohan wasn’t watching, murmuring things like “Bhabhi, aaj kitni tight skirt pehni hai… andar kuch hai bhi?” I pretended to ignore it, but the way their eyes stripped me made my pussy throb.

Saturday night at Rohan’s flat—drinks flowing, music thumping, Rohan got blackout drunk by 1 a.m., collapsed on the couch, head thrown back, snoring in thick, wet rasps. The room stank of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, and male sweat. The three of them went dead silent, then turned to me with matching dark grins.

Asif leaned forward first. “Ab boss so gaya… ab yeh maal hum teeno ki hai raat bhar. Kya bolti hai, randi?”

I tried to laugh it off, voice trembling. “Guys… please, he’ll wake up. Stop it.”

Zaid stood up slowly, locked the door with a loud click. “Uthega nahi. Aur agar uth bhi gaya toh kya? Dekhega ki uski girlfriend kitni badi sasti lund ki bhukhi hai.”

Imran grabbed my arms from behind, fingers digging deep into my skin. His hot breath hit my ear. “Yeh top pehen ke aayi hai bina bra ke… nipples khade hain jaise humare liye hi taiyar karke aayi ho. Bol, soch rahi thi hum chhod denge?”

My heart hammered so hard I could feel it in my throat. “Please… mat karo,” I whispered, but my legs were already shaking, slickness soaking my thong.

Asif yanked me down to the carpet right in front of Rohan’s sleeping face. “Ghutno pe baith, kutiya! Abhi!”

I dropped to my knees, carpet burning my skin. They unzipped together—three thick, heavy cocks springing free, the musky scent of arousal hitting me like a wave.

Asif slapped his fat shaft across my cheek—hot, stinging. “Choos, saali! Tere boyfriend ke doston ka lund taste kar. Muh khol jaldi!”

I opened wide. Asif rammed straight to the back of my throat. The salty, bitter taste exploded on my tongue; I gagged hard, eyes watering instantly. “Haan aise hi… gale tak le, randi! Zor se choos! Bol… kitni badi whore hai tu?”

I choked out around his cock, spit bubbling: “Bohot badi… main aap sabki sasti whore hoon…”

Zaid fisted my hair, yanked my head onto his dick. “Aur zor se choos, kutiya! Yeh muh sirf hum teeno ke liye bana hai. Rohan ko pata chalega ki uski girlfriend kitni professional hai lund choosne mein.”

Imran ripped my top down—fabric tearing, cold air hitting my nipples. He twisted them viciously. “Chhati dikha, saali! Yeh nipples humare liye hi khade hain. Bol… ‘please mere nipples maslo, main aapki randi hoon’.”

“Please… mere nipples maslo… main aapki randi hoon,” I moaned, voice muffled and wet.

They face-fucked me in turns—brutal, relentless. Balls slapped my chin wetly, spit poured down my neck in thick rivers, pooling between my breasts. My jaw ached, throat burned raw, mascara running black down my face.

Asif pulled out, slapped my face hard. “Ab table pe jhuk, kutiya! Skirt upar kar.”

They bent me over the coffee table facing Rohan’s slack mouth. Skirt flipped up, thong torn off and shoved into my mouth as a gag. Asif spat on my pussy, rubbed his head once, then slammed in raw—deep, brutal stretch.

“Aahh… kitni tight hai yeh chut! Rohan ko chodne ka time nahi milta kya? Aaj hum teeno faad denge! Bol… ‘please mujhe faad do’.”

I sobbed through the gag: “Please… mujhe faad do…”

Zaid shoved back into my mouth. “Choos, randi! Gale tak le!”

Imran spat on my asshole, forced in—no mercy. The searing burn made me scream into Zaid’s cock. Double penetration—Asif wrecking my pussy, Imran destroying my ass—while Zaid kept my throat stuffed. Every thrust sent shockwaves through me, skin slapping wetly, sweat pouring, body trembling uncontrollably.

Zaid slapped my cheek. “Bol… ‘please mujhe gangr&pe karo, main Rohan ki girlfriend hoon par tumhari personal fucktoy hoon’.”

“Please… mujhe gangr&pe karo… main Rohan ki girlfriend hoon par tumhari personal fucktoy hoon… faad do mujhe… sab andar daalo!” I cried, drool and tears everywhere.

They went savage. Switched holes—pussy to ass to mouth—no breaks. Hands slapped my tits purple, choked my throat till I saw stars, pulled hair like reins. I came hard—squirting violently, hot jets soaking the floor, body convulsing.

Asif laughed. “Dekh… fountain ban gayi yeh! Ab aur zor se! Le mera maal!”

Cum flooded me—thick ropes deep in pussy, hot spurts in ass, bitter loads forced down my throat till I choked and swallowed. They kept going, filling me over and over.

Imran growled: “Le mera bhi… pura bhar de andar, randi!”

They finished on me—final loads across my face, tits, ass. Cum dripping everywhere, hair matted, clothes ruined, body bruised and marked.

Rohan stirred, mumbled “Baby…?” They froze. Asif whispered in my ear: “Chup reh, warna utha ke uske saamne hi continue kar denge.”

He didn’t wake. They zipped up, patted my leaking ass.

Asif smirked: “Kal phir aana… Rohan ke saath movie dekhne. Agli baar aur brutal hoga. Taiyar rehna.”

I crawled away, showered in silence, hid the marks. When Rohan woke, I curled into him sweetly.

“You okay, love? You look… completely wrecked,” he said softly.

I smiled, throat still raw. “Just partied too hard… love you.”

Inside, every hole burned, full of his friends’ cum, body aching deliciously. Rohan had no idea his sweet girlfriend had just been brutally gangr&ped right next to him—begging for more while they talked filthy the whole time. And I was already counting the hours till next time. 😈💦",2,1768882841.0,InnocentLust,0,1.0,False

1qhr1gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1qhr1gu/my_rankings_of_japanese_fast_foodfamily/,My Rankings of Japanese Fast Food/Family Restaurants/Chains,"Hi all, this is something I wrote for my Substack (so it's a little bloggy) but would love to actually discuss opinions on these places. Chain restaurants were one of my favorite parts of my three week solo graduation trip, and I know some others feel this way too. I would also recommend Japanalysis tier list video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrYLxXkrz-k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrYLxXkrz-k) if you love this subject as much as I do.

A Quick Note on Convenience Stores 

The reputation for Japan’s convenience stores is absolutely earned. For an American, going into one for the first time will have more novelty than patronizing a Michelin Star restaurant. Firstly, and most strikingly for Americans, it is a convenience store that is not a complete fucking shithole. Second, it is actually very clean and the customer service is probably equivalent to the previous mentioned restaurant. This will give you the first taste of Japan’s unique products, mostly for the better. Not everything was a hit for me; the bread and some other pastries were dry and unappetizing. But I liked most of the products I bought. The fried chicken is always a hit, and Galbo chocolates were one of my favorites sweets. I also treasured the 1000 yen umbrella I got that lasted me the whole journey. Additionally, the stores have ATMs and a bunch of other things a tourist wouldn’t use like printers and these signature stamp things. Anyway, this should be the first stop if someone’s never been to Asia before. Now, to rank the fast food from worst to best.

McDonald’s: 

Order Method: The same kiosks that are everywhere else 

I don’t disagree with those who say the ones here are better than America’s, but for me it is too similar to go more than once during a stay. The most notable difference was that the employees keep their likely depression and frustration with working there to themselves; they are just as friendly as employees anywhere else. The only unique item I liked was the Shaka Shaka chicken, a piece of fried chicken in a bag that you pour spice into and shake around to make it stick everywhere. Both the cheddar cheese and red pepper flavors were good.

Gusto 

Order Method: Tablet 

This is a family restaurant with a good selection of Japanese home-style meals (but a place further on the list does this better). I went here two or three times I think, and got stuff like hamburg steak and corn. But the standout here, also present in other family restaurants, is the drink bar. For children this means unlimited soda; for me it meant as much coffee as I pleased. If this isn’t appealing to you, this place should probably be at the bottom of the list.

Torikizoku 

Order Method: Tablet 

This will be higher if you come with other people, especially those who like to drink. This is a yakitori joint, or grilled chicken on sticks. Both the yakitori and the selection of drinks are great value, and you won’t feel guilty about making a third order. The beer is solid, but the yakitori was unfortunately nothing spectacular. This might be a pass if going solo. What did brighten the experience for me was the waitress’ sheer enthusiasm in explaining the restaurant to me in the minimal amount of English words she knew. This at least put a wide grin on my face.

Saizeriya 

Order Method: Scan QR code with phone 

Going off the quality of this location’s food, it should not be where it is on the least. What put it here was all the novelty I experienced in my first visit. Above all else, this place is where you can save a buck. It is designed so that you can order many different “Italian” dishes for a couple hundred yen each. The carbonara and many of the starters were very passable. There is also and absolutely rancid glass of wine you can get for a hundred yen. I already knew it would be terrible and only drank a couple sips, but I had never bought wine for so cheap before. The drink bar is also present here, and since Saizeriya was the first and most visited family restaurant I went to, it is where most of the fond memories of unlimited caffeine took place. The combination of my American love for processed food and my Jewish love for being cheap was also what earned it its spot. I won’t be particularly excited for any specific dish, but I will absolutely come back here multiple times on my next visit. You probably won’t love the food, but maybe this will earn a special place in your heart as well.

Coco Ichibanya 

Order Method: Also tablet if I remember correctly 

This earns a spot in many people’s S tier, and while I enjoyed my singular visit, I am not as enamored. I like Japanese-style curry for what it is, but to me it is emblematic of Japan’s lack of ability to handle spice (heat) properly. It’s really just the same added seasoning in different quantities. The dish itself is still delicious and hearty, and you are hard pressed to find a cheaper option for something as comforting.

Yayoiken 

Order Method: Buy meal ticket at the entrance and give to server who sits you 

I think this is the best chain spot for Japanese comfort food. I got the fried chicken in tartar sauce and different kinds of pork cutlets. What I thought I would really love first coming here was the rice dispenser. Indeed, it is pleasant to use and it’s quality rice, but I realized I didn’t need much more than one bowl for my meals. Still, if you’re in the mood to gouge on this good stuff, it can have you set. There really isn’t too much else to write about here, other than the food is quality, good value, and the interior is spacious and pleasing.

Matsuya, Sukiya, and Yoshinoya 

Order Method: Varies by location 

These are the main three gyudon (beef rice bowls, usually with onions) chains. Matusya is the cheapest and was my most frequented because of its proximity to my hotel in Tokyo (I was there ten days total). Yoshinoya is classiest with their serving of fried eggs directly on the skillet, but was my least visited. Yoshinoya usually has more tight and less private seating, which didn’t mesh well with the anxiety I had on my first solo trip. Sukiya might be the best all rounder, but it’s pretty similar to Matsuya and should be a tossup. In total, the gyudon chains were a staple all throughout my trip due to the cheap price and acceptable to solid flavors. The gyudon already has flexibility with the different options of eggs, kimchi, or cheese for toppings, but there are solid non-gyudon options like Bibimbap and short rib bowls. It’s also serviceable for a breakfast spot; eggs, miso soup, salmon, sausage, and pickled vegetables were a good way to start a lot of days. Again, the value is incredible; If you spend more than five dollars here, you are getting a heaping pile of food.

Sushiro 

Order Method: Tablet 

It’s not the absolute best sushi in the country, but what you can get for your money here is fantastic, similar to the gyudon chains. I love seafood in spite of my parents never cooking it, and it was great to sample all of the staple fish. The variety is also the selling point. You can get all kinds of fun sides as well, including small ramen bowls, tempura, and french fries. Cheap drinks are here as well. But what I loved most of all was the style of ordering and eating that comes with the setup. You can eat exactly what you want at the speed you want, even more so than Saizeriya.

As you can see from above, I fell in love with the fast food scene in Japan, which is something that might sound ridiculous to someone who has never been. I am a little ashamed I let my jitters get to me; these places made up the vast majority of where I ate. I had maybe a couple independent restaurants and some street food (unagi eel was the standout). Still, I can’t blame myself too hard for preferring the comfort and privacy of ordering mostly from tablets, as ordering in Japanese was not something I was comfortable with our would have been able to do yet. On the flipside, I was able to get very intimate with the spots I did frequent.

1qhquo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/1qhquo5/hq_sucked_too/,HQ Sucked Too,"Friday was my last day. 

Today was the 1st time in 4 years i didn't have to call in, or dread going to work.

I was indeed lucky enough to work from home. Specifically I was one of the many ppl you could've spoken with when you called the 1800# on the back of the TGT credit card.

I got to go to work in my own home, in comfy pants. The commute was awesome and the coffee was spectacular. 

But it sucked for us too. Especially as someone with unhealed trauma and a people pleaser.

One of the many phrases we were told was ""we aren't saving lives here""...try telling that to the single mother who uses the TGT credit card to buy her baby's formula and our system is saying she hasn't paid in 3 months.(closes the card after 3 months, permanently and the Guest cant reapply for a year)

Or much less try telling that to the guy who is yelling in my ear calling me anything but a white woman because I can't remove a late fee that will close the card that helps his family get groceries every month.

The lack of actual humanity in HQ is...astounding. 

Needless to say my mental health was taking a hit every day, multiple times a day. I couldn't disassociate for 8hrs a day anymore. Especially in our country's current political climate and TGT's lack of response to specific incidents. 

I couldn't take it anymore. Im lucky that im in a space that I could say ""I quit"". Im so sorry for those that can't.

I'm really into fashion, like it's a hobby for me. I plan outfits, I follow trends, I genuinely enjoy putting looks together. For this date I wore a printed midi skirt with a tucked in black turtleneck and boots. Nothing crazy, just an outfit I felt good in that showed I put thought into how I looked.

We met for coffee and within 10 minutes he said ""wow you really dressed up for this huh"" in this tone that made it clear he thought I was doing too much. I said yeah I like getting dressed and he said ""most girls just wear jeans on first dates, this feels like you're trying really hard.""

Here's the thing, I could've felt embarrassed. Old me probably would've made an excuse or apologized or shown up in jeans to the second date if there was one. But instead I just felt clear. If he thinks putting effort into how I look is ""trying too hard"" then we're not compatible and I should know that now, not six months in when I'm shrinking myself to seem more chill.

I finished my coffee, said I didn't think we were a good match, and left. He texted later asking for another chance and saying he didn't mean it like that, but yes he did. He meant exactly that and he showed me who he was immediately.

I wasted too much of my life trying to be the cool girl who doesn't care about stuff like clothes or makeup because guys found that more appealing. I'm done with that. Now I shop for things I love, I like things that are in trend, unique and with good quality, for example, I found a coat with like pink feathers on plush, and he would have definitely made a comment about it, and if someone thinks I'm too much because I care about fashion, they're not my person.

Wearing what you love on a first date is the best filter because you find out right away if someone appreciates you or wants you to tone yourself down. But in the back of my mind is the thought that maybe I’m way too drastic on my choices? but is it really worth it being with someone that I wouldn't feel comfortable with before? did I judge him too quickly?",14,1768882162.0,dating_advice,9,1.0,False

Given that rise of content creators, there was sort of this very sub niche of celebrity within the community. Both him and I realized that we often get mistaken for some. And even when we say we aren’t, often there’s the subtext of “you’re just saying that because you want privacy.”

This weekend, I was at a gay bar and a gaggle of gays approached me saying that I was someone named Tim Champagne. I guess he’s sort of a queer baiter and not well liked. When I tried to explain that I wasn’t this person, I had no idea who they even were, they continue to say that I was. I have to say the resemblance is very similar, but their adamant that I was lying in order to keep privacy was an interesting twist in celebrity. Probably because of that of course adult content bent.

1qhqfns,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhqfns,"Starved by My Folks, Still Beat Them to the Top","Senior year started with my meal card at zero.


Meanwhile, my billionaire parents were living it up in Switzerland with my cousin Melissa.


I called Mom, stomach twisting.


""Mom, you said if I worked at the factory all summer, you'd load my account.""


She laughed. Sharp and cold.


""You made money and didn't even think to buy us a gift? Ungrateful brat. Maybe going hungry will teach you some respect!""


But they only paid me three bucks an hour! I could barely afford food.


That night, Melissa posted pics—lobster, champagne, my parents grinning beside her at some fancy Swiss restaurant.


Me? I was eating someone's leftover cafeteria food.


But later, they showed up at my door on their knees. Begging.


I just looked down at them and smiled.


""You always said mistakes have consequences. Remember, Mom? Dad? YOU taught me that.""


...


I was dunking a stale roll into water when Melissa's Instagram story popped up—my parents and her at some bougie seafood restaurant.


The table was covered in lobster, crab, you name it.


Dad placed a cheese-baked langoustine on Melissa's plate like she was royalty.


Mom clinked champagne glasses with her, all smiles. One glass of that stuff probably cost more than I'd spend all year.


Melissa's caption: ""Crying happy tears for the world's BEST aunt and uncle! RIP my diet lol""


They looked like the perfect family.


I stared at that spread, then down at my soggy roll mush. Mixed with my tears, it tasted like salt and shame.


Then my stomach cramped hard—I'd been running on empty too long. I doubled over and knocked the bowl off the table. It splattered everywhere.


The dining hall was closing.


Staff were clearing tables fast. Panicking, I scraped the mush back into the bowl with my hands, even licking my fingers clean.


""Yara... what are you doing?""


My roommate Sophie's voice snapped me back to reality. My face burned instantly.


Can't blame her for being shocked. Everyone knew me as the daughter of the county's richest family.


My parents were famous for their generosity—they'd literally donated a whole scholarship fund to the school.


Who would've guessed their own daughter was eating floor scraps?


See, they always said they'd suffered like hell building their business from nothing, so I had to suffer too. That's how I'd ""earn"" the right to inherit their empire.


So they crushed me at every turn.


But Melissa? She got whatever the hell she wanted. Couldn't let the relatives think they were cheap, right?


This summer, they told me I could only get living expenses for senior year if I worked at their factory.


I didn't argue. Since I was seven, every single dollar I spent had to be earned through labor.


Even though they paid me half what regular workers made, I busted my ass. Showed up with a 102-degree fever, didn't dare take a break—terrified they'd call me ""spoiled"" and dock my pay.


Finally, the day before school started, Mom glanced at my ten-hour shifts and nodded. Said she'd load up my meal card.


I barely had time to breathe before Melissa suddenly showed up with some cheap-ass keychain she'd gotten free with a drink purchase.


""Auntie, Uncle! I brought you a souvenir from my trip!""


With that, she clipped it onto Mom's ten-thousand-dollar Hermès bag.


Mom's face lit up. She pulled out a fat stack of hundreds and shoved it into Melissa's hand.


""You're so thoughtful, sweetie. I don't have a proper gift ready, but take this.""


Melissa's grin stretched ear to ear. Then she turned to me.


""I heard Yara worked at the factory this summer. Did you get Auntie and Uncle anything?""


I forced a smile.


That paycheck barely covered cafeteria food. The only thing left over was going toward a new bra—mine was literally falling apart. There was nothing left for gifts.


When I didn't answer, Melissa's tone turned sharp.


""Yara, I'm just saying—you're old enough to know better. Your parents have sacrificed so much for you. You can't be this selfish. You should be thinking about giving back.""


I smiled awkwardly, not noticing Mom's expression going ice-cold.


That night, Mom made me write out exactly how I planned to spend every cent.


I didn't get it, but I didn't dare refuse. I scribbled it all down, hands shaking.


She read each line aloud, her face getting darker and darker. When she hit ""bra,"" she exploded. Ripped the paper to shreds.


Before I could react—slap.


My cheek stung like fire.


""Ungrateful brat! Your father and I wasted our lives raising you, and you don't give a damn about us. You're worse than Melissa, and she's not even our daughter!""


""You earn money and don't think to give us anything. Instead you want to buy a bra? Disgusting. Shameless. Is that how we raised you? You're probably thinking about boys, aren't you?""


She was crying now, like I'd stabbed her in the heart.


Years of frustration boiled over. I muttered under my breath.


""But you didn't give me enough to buy anything else... I need a bra because my old one's falling apart.""


Big mistake.


Mom started shaking, screaming for Dad.


""Richard! Richard! I can't deal with her anymore—your daughter's out of control!""


The door slammed open.


Dad stood there, face like stone.


Chapter 2


Dad settled into the couch, voice going all soft and reasonable. ""Yara, sweetheart, do you feel like we're not giving you enough?""


The concerned father act. Classic.


But I was shaking too hard to answer.


Because I knew—Dad was way scarier than Mom. Way worse.


""Answer me, you worthless little shit!""


His fist crashed down on the coffee table. Voice like a whip crack.


And that's when something in me just... snapped. Every bit of hurt I'd been choking down for years came pouring out.


""YES! You barely give me ANYTHING! It's not even half what the poorest kid at school gets! I can only buy the cheapest crap in the dining hall!"" And even then, I'm still starving half the time.


My voice got quieter as I watched Dad's mouth twist into this cold, vicious smile.


Then his foot slammed into my stomach. Pain exploded through me and I crumpled to the floor, gasping for air.


SLAP! Right across the face.


""That's for disrespecting your parents! We raised you to honor your elders. But you made your mother CRY. You screamed at ME. Is that how you were raised?!""


Before I could even catch my breath—SLAP. Harder this time.


""That's for being ungrateful! You have ANY idea what we sacrificed to build this company from nothing? We've given you EVERYTHING—food, clothes, a roof over your head. And you DARE complain?!""


Then—SLAP. Even harder. My head snapped to the side.


""And THAT'S for being shameless! You get a paycheck and don't think to give us a single dollar. Instead you're buying bras? What the hell kind of thoughts are you having? You got no shame at all?!""


My right cheek was swollen and throbbing. Blood dripped from the corner of my mouth.


They just stared down at me like I was garbage.


""Stay on your knees and think about what you've done.""


Then they walked away, leaving me on that freezing floor. All. Night. Long.


I didn't fight back. Didn't say another word. Just knelt there praying that if I stayed quiet and obedient enough, they'd cool off and finally give me the money.


But when they were already halfway to Switzerland, sipping champagne at 30,000 feet, I finally checked my account.


Zero.


""I can't even buy food anymore.""


The tears came hard and fast. I felt completely, utterly hollow inside.


After I told Sophie everything, her eyes welled up too. She grabbed her meal card and shoved it into my trembling hands.


""Yara... just call them tomorrow, okay? Beg if you have to. You're their only kid. Their ONLY child. No matter how messed up this is, when they see you actually suffering like this, they'll care. They have to care.""


I stared down at Sophie's card in my hands. This kindness from someone who barely knew me—it hurt worse than any slap.


But somewhere deep down, buried under all the pain and fear, a tiny, desperate hope flickered to life.


Would they actually care? Could they?


Chapter 3


The next day, I called them. Heart pounding, hands shaking.


I didn't even get the words ""I'm hungry"" out before I heard laughing and chattering on the other end.


Mom and Melissa. Out shopping.


Melissa's voice came through, all sweet and fake-modest.


""Auntie, this dress is gorgeous on me, but... it's fifteen thousand dollars. That's way too much. I can't let you spend that on me.""


Mom's voice went all soft and warm.


""Sweetie, if you love it, we're getting it. Don't even think about the price.""


Then she turned on me. Voice like ice.


""What do YOU want?""


Like I was some annoying spam caller.


I brought up the living expenses. Tried to sound small. Harmless.


Scared they were still pissed, I practically groveled. Apologized for everything. Swore up and down that the second I got the money, I'd buy them whatever gifts they wanted.


But Mom still unleashed on me. Every nasty word in the book. I stood there shaking, barely holding it together.


Then Dad's voice cut in. Calm. Almost reasonable.


""Fine. You've learned your lesson. We'll send the money.""


Relief flooded through me like oxygen.


I was crying—actually crying happy tears—thanking them over and over.


But when I checked my account, my heart stopped.


Half. They'd only sent HALF.


I called back, panic choking me.


Dad laughed. Cold and mean.


""We spoiled you too much. That's why you don't get it. So your mother and I decided—you're earning the other half yourself this year.""


""Only when you know what it's like to work for money will you deserve to be our kid!""


After that, click. He hung up.


I felt like I'd been dunked in ice water.


Senior year. SATs coming up. I barely had time to breathe, let alone study.


How the hell was I supposed to make money?

Great staff, food/coffee, and the internet was extremely fast.

Every time I came it was filled with people working and hanging out on the main floor and second floor.

It quickly became my favorite coffee shop!

Now I'm back in Bacolod and I come to hear Tom N Toms underwent renovations. It looks like there's no longer a second floor and things have significantly changed.

While the staff is still very friendly and coffee/food is still good, the internet is no longer as fast (21/mbps download) and you are restricted to 1 hour of internet usage.

When I showed up in the morning, I was the only customer (I wondered why?)

I was sad to see a place that was once a vibrant hotspot no longer as active.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Also, English is my only language but I suck at it. LOL

My (45F) husbands (53M) son P (27M) is getting married to his gf E (24F) on Sep 25, 2026 and I am at odds as to what to do. M had two boys J(passed) and P. I had a boy D (23M) and a girl S(21F) and we have all been a family for 17 years. 

We have always had some sort of struggle or some sort of fight. Both M and Is exes were abusive alcoholics who would cheat on us with anyone they could. I left my ex and had to leave everything we owned to get away from the abuse. M got full custody of his boys and she had supervised visitations for the first couple years. M and I met and instantly clicked. We probably jumped in too fast or tried to mix the kids too fast, but at the end of the day the 3 are super close. J had an endocrine disease that he kept telling us he was taking his meds and we didnt know he wasnt until it was too late. He would say they made him sick and I was able to get him meds to help with that. He then said he couldnt afford them so I started getting them. He got a cold and passed away almost 10 years ago when he was 19 years old. 

About 6 years ago is when everything started going to crap. The kids werent helping with chores and would yell at me when I would get mad. There were many days that they would just attack me and yell at me with nothing they hoped to accomplish. It was just ""your a horrible person and a horrible parent."" For instance, my ex brother in law came out as my ex sister in law. I knew this person for almost 20 years at this point and I slipped and said boy name instead of girl name a couple times and I was crucified for it. I fully support her but I had known the other name for half my llife, it was a hard habbit to break. But then things would go back to normal. I would always offer Tuesday night Movie nights, going kyaking, swimming, hiking, camping, shopping, anything to get us out and doing something and they started to blow me off more and more.

The weekend before Thanksgiving 2020 D talked to us about needing to work on a Sunday and he asked if he could use my car. He normally worked Mon thru Thursday and was using my car to get to and from work. We agreed, told him we would get Thanksgiving shopping done on Saturday and headed out. We didnt really think much of it when we got home at 8 and it seemed like he already went to bed. The next day I noticed my car was still here at 10 AM and I tried to find him to see if he made it to work. He didnt answer my calls or texts and for 3 days I had no idea where he went or if he was ok. I finally broke down and texted his friends to see if he was ok and was then told that I was trying to manipulate him because I asked his friends. A few months later he moved back in because he had to pay rent at his friends and not at our house. So he came back for a few months and then moved to a different state. I then pointed out that his girlfriend being the only one that had access to his account and her saying ""You shouldnt have stopped at your families house when we had plans in 3 hours"" were red flags. We lived 10 minutes from her. So he called me, yelled at me for everything he could think of like when I asked if he could help me with a vet bill for our dog because he got a spinal injury 5 days before I got paid. He then told me that P encouraged him to leave before thanksgiving like he did. He also told me that unless I divorce my husband he wanted nothing to do with me and I hung up. It was a year before he woud talk to me again. Both M and I wished him happy birthday that year and he responded to M but not me. He finally contacted me and we tried to rebuild our relationship. A few months ago we moved him back to our state and let him stay with us until he could get back on his feet. (this was after we drove 5 hours to where he was staying every other weekend to fix his house for him that he just walked away from.) His story TBC.......

P always hated me. From the very begining he hated me. His mom was super toxic to him and convinced him that I was going to do horrible things to him and he shouldnt trust me. It was a daily fight for the first couple years. Then he started coming out of it and we started to form a bond. I thought we were doing great. He over heard me saying ""for someone that lives here rent free you would think he would help out more with chores."" He then got pissed and moved out. He didnt talk to me for about 6 months and then he made it a point to apologize for not helping with chores. His roommate would trash their house and leave it for P to clean up, over and over. He said he had a firm understanding on how I felt and apologized. Since then I thought we were doing good, I got to know his GF E pretty well and everything seemed fine. I can not tell you how wrong I was. 

About 5 years ago, S told me that J molested her when she was younger. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I tried to prevent that from happening and if I would have known I would have stopped it. I taught them all the No-No square song and did regular checkups to see if anything was happening and I was always told no. S told me I couldnt talk to M or P about it because she didnt want them to know. I respected that but over the next couple weeks anytime M or P would talk about J she would yell at me and say I didnt belive her because I wouldnt stop them from talking about him because I couldnt tell them why. So I told M. We sat her down, we told her we were sorry that it happened to her and we told her that she needed to bring it up in her counsoling. She didnt want to do that. But she made us remove just about everything of his, we cant talk about him or acknowledge his birth or death date. She started dating a boy that lived with my ex and she wanted to live with him as well. She put together a powerpoint of how this would improve her life by illegially using someone elses address to get her into a school with a college degree aspect with it. I wasnt born yesterday and I reminded her that her school had it too and I was not giving her permission to move in with her boyfriend at almost 17 years old. (and my ex smoked meth in his house, he beat up one of his girlfriends in front of her, he had stage 4 siphilis, and was going through a bad divorce.) She then screamed ""You let J molest me."" in the middle of a packed restaurant that instantly went silent and everyone stared at me. I got up and left. Then the next day I brought it up to her counselor, and she threw a fit, started yelling at me, slammed doors and left the office and refused to come back in. She never went back to that counselor. That counselor had diagnosed her with BPD and that is one of the reasons she claims she never went back. For a couple years she would use ""You let J molest me"" when she wasnt getting her way. We heard it so many times that it send me into panic attacks everytime she talks about it now.

Now for the fight that lead to me looking for cruises. The first weekend in November 2025 S made me leave work early so we could ""talk."" Then she looked me dead in the face and said ""Do you actually believe me about J?"" It was full of attitude and took me by surprise. I went through everything we have done how many times I have stayed up late talking to her about it and everything I tried to do. I then yelled at her and said ""when is enough enough? When are you going to take the steps to get help so this doesnt follow you your whole life?"" In tears I then said ""at 7 years old when my mother caught someone molesting me she told me to stop being a slut."" and I turned away in tears and went for a 2 1/2 hour walk. When I came home she wasnt here and she wasnt talking to me. She would then sneak in late at night and grab some of her stuff and then leave. If we crossed paths I would try to talk to her but I was mostly half asleep on the couch and dont remember what I said. (I have had bad insomnia for that last 6 years and have to take heavy meds so I can sleep the 3 or 4 hours I get) She then stopped coming at night and would come when she knew I was working so i couldnt talk. She still has a lot of stuff here that she is indefinately putting off taking. Apparently she blocked M and I so all the messages about finding her own car insurance were not being received (i got yell at for this that will come up later) She also had Ms dads sewing machine that he inherited and, I guess my moms serger that I didnt even know she took. We spent almost 2 months asking for them back and she refused to return them until I contacted her friends mom and asked if we could get them back and in the words of my ex ""she is returning them out of the goodness of her heart and not because you asked her friends mom."" Since S started the fight, I have been going deeper into depression. I dont have much fight left, I pray I dont wake up and then I literally have to fight to keep going. The week before christmas, D and M had both gone to bed and I broke down crying on the couch. D was shocked when he saw i was still awake and asked what was wrong. I told him I didnt want to talk about it and he kept asking, so I finally told him. Then 2 days later after I tried to do christmas shopping in hopes it would make me feel better I got a call from my ex. He then blamed me for everything that happened with J and said I never told him, which I did. he Then repeated almost word for word when I told D and then he started saying that it was because I was a horrible person, blah, blah, blah. He also blamed me because S had to find her own insurance and she was freaking out about it. We left her on ours for a month after she left. BUT he also said that S told him that when she told P about J P told her that J would offer to include P. P always declined but he never told us. I instantly said ""with how by the rules P is, if he knew we all would have know."" Then i made the mistake of asking/telling P which everyone took as me accusing him. But I was more telling him because S and my ex are one in the same. If he says it she is too and vice versa. The next morning I wake up and while I am having coffee D comes home and instantly starts screaming at me. Vein popping out of the neck, spit flying, screaming. I asked him to leave so he could calm down and that set him off even more. He told me all three of them hate me and want nothing to do with me. I left and ended up just driving for a few hours. Since then every time I start feeling better my brain kicks back to ""go to war."" because that is what has been happening. As soon as I pick me up they push me down. P manipulates D to punish me when he is mad at me. Then he sends small bread crumbs to M and then cuts M off and blames me even when I havent talked to him in months. And the cycle begins again. 

M and I have had out ups and downs. For the most part we are solid, but lately i feel unstable. He doesnt really stand up for me to the kids and when I try to talk to him about problems or the way I feel he cuts me off and yells over me. It has been pretty bad lately because I feel like I am being thrown from one catastrophe to the next and I dont have anyone I can talk to. Any time I try to pick myself up I get thrown back down. 

I dont want M to have to choose between me or his kids wedding and I think they will not invite him if I am here. They also invited my best friend of 25 years. But my friend and M are telling me it would be an a hole move if I didnt even try to make myself available for it. M said he thinks he wont be invited either but then why would they invite my best friend that P didnt even really like. I dont want to be here all alone while everyone else that I love with all my heart is there. I also dont want to be the reason M misses out on his only sons wedding. I honestly dont know what to do anymore. ",1,1768880746.0,AIAH,0,1.0,False

I’m after something real. Shared values, actual trust, long-term goals. Not into games, flings, or modern dating nonsense.

\*\*About Me:\*\* Music’s a big part of my life. I mostly listen to extreme metal, black and death metal stuff. Cradle of Filth is my favorite band, with Belphegor and Burzum right behind. I do vocals for fun and used to play with some guys (I have hit the drum set a couple times). Emperor's song With Strength I Burn probably has my favorite lyrics. You don’t have to love the music, but you’ll need to be okay with the sound, the shirts, and the wall art.

I work in IT, handling help desk support for the rest of the staff, and I’m starting to get into software security. I know tech pretty well but I don’t like to live online. I’ll scroll sometimes, but I’d rather be talking or watching something together than just sitting on our phones.

Been gaming since I was a kid. I’m into Dark Souls, Resident Evil, Timesplitters, and old Tony Hawk. Still down for Kirby or Mario Party with friends. I like board games that actually require some thought, like Betrayal at House on the Hill or HeroQuest. Other stuff I’m into: classic horror, building Gunpla kits, museums, occasional camping, and I’ve been slowly learning Japanese. I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, or even bother with caffeine usually, not in a judgy way if you drink coffee (but in a judgy way of you smoke).

\*\*What I’m Like:\*\* Introverted at first but social once I’m comfortable. My humor’s usually dry, dark, or a little weird. People say I’m easy to talk to and usually pretty funny in person. I have a strong filter for quality, whether it’s people, ideas, or anything else in life. I don’t fake things and can come off as negative sometimes but that just amplifies the stuff I do like as genuine and not slop. I take relationships seriously. I’m not afraid of commitment, I just want it to be with the right person, someone I can actually build a life with. I’ll take care of the people I love. I’m reliable, loyal, and when I’m with someone, I’m all in.

\*\*What I’m Looking For:\*\* I want a serious relationship with someone who shares traditional values. Long-term, I want a dynamic where I provide and my partner takes care of the home and raises a family. If that sounds boring or outdated to you, we’re probably not a match. I’m looking for someone younger, ideally between 18 and 24, since I want a big family and the timeline matters. I’m most attracted to East Asian or white women with a slim or average build, obviously personality is king but we can’t deny that physical attraction matters. As such I’ve attached pics of me for you to judge.

\*\*Dealbreakers:\*\* tattoos, far-left politics, weed or drug use, heavy drinking, or being chronically online. If you’re into gaming, metal, horror, or nerd stuff, we’ll probably get along. I’m not expecting perfect. Just someone honest, loyal, and serious about building something real. You obviously don’t need to match me 100%, I’m open to trying new things (as long as I’m not doing substances) and hope you’re at least receptive to trying a board game or TCG.

1qhqc0z,https://i.redd.it/1tar3feeefeg1.jpeg,Cubicle War with the Boss's Daughter,"A new guy joined the team next to my cubicle.


The next day, the boss's daughter stormed in.


She pointed at me and said, ""You're not allowed to sit next to my boyfriend.""


By the end of the week, my project got canceled, my promotion went up in smoke—and I somehow got ""reassigned"" to janitorial duty.


Guess sitting in the wrong chair's a felony now?


And while the whole company's throwing a party for our future son-in-law, I'm looking down at the folder on my phone.


""Hey, princess,"" I mutter. ""Wanna guess if the stuff I found while cleaning is enough to make you find yourself a new boyfriend?""


---


A loud crash from the next cubicle pulled me out of my spreadsheet.


""Sorry about that! Dropped my mug.""


A guy with a boyish smile stood up and waved.


""Hey, I'm Logan Reed. Just started here. Looking forward to working with you.""


Didn't even notice when someone took that empty desk.


He looked young—fresh out of college, probably.


I gave him my name and went right back to work.


After hours, Nora came bouncing over, grinning like she'd just won the lottery.


""Avery, that new guy sitting next to you—he's kinda cute, right?""


I rubbed my temples. His face had already slipped from my memory after one glance.


Not that Nora cared.


""Ugh, I'm too far away to see him properly. All I caught was his back, but it's a nice back.""


The next morning, I thought it'd be just another regular workday.


But when I walked in, someone was already sitting at my desk.


""Hey, excuse me? That's my spot. If you're new, HR can help you find yours.""


The girl spun around and gave me a slow, snarky once-over.


""So you're the one sitting next to Logan?""


""Who?""


The name rang a bell but barely.


""From now on, you're moving. You're not sitting here again!""


She folded her arms.


""You're too close to him. I don't want you flirting with my boyfriend.""


Her tone was so dramatic, I couldn't help but laugh.


""Sweetheart, what is this—a TikTok skit? You filming something?""


I glanced around the office. ""Where's the hidden camera?""


""Look, I've got deadlines. If you're shooting a parody, talk to Daniel, our manager. He loves attention.""


I dropped my bag on the desk and logged in.


Before she could keep ranting, someone rushed over.


Oh—Logan, the new guy.


""Savannah Collins, what the hell are you doing? This is the office!"" he snapped.


Then he turned to me, apologetic.


""Sorry, Avery. Please, take your seat.""


That just made Savannah angrier. She jabbed a finger at me.


""Do you even know who I am?!""


The clock was ticking toward start time, and people were already gathering to watch the drama.


I'd had enough.


While she was busy glaring at Logan, I pulled out my chair, sat down, and ignored them both.


Chapter 2


Logan whispered something to her; she glared daggers at me, then stomped off.


I kept typing like nothing happened.


When I went to refill my coffee, Nora came rushing over, gossip practically spilling out of her mouth.


""Girl—that was Savannah Charles. Mr. Charles's only daughter. And Logan's her boyfriend.""


I rolled my eyes.


""And I'm supposed to care because...?""


I'd been sitting at that desk for years. Perfect lighting, quiet corner, close to the window.


Now she wanted me to move just because of her insecurity?


Apparently, she wasn't done.


After lunch, HR called me in.


Linda greeted me with that strained ""please-don't-yell-at-me"" smile, and I immediately knew what this was about.


""Avery, about this morning's... situation. It's best if we just—uh—reassign your workspace.""


I sighed.


""Daniel told you to say that, didn't he?""


Her silence said it all.


I stood up and nodded. ""Fine. I'll move.""


Linda had always been decent to me—same alma mater, helped me out when I first joined.


No point making her life harder over a spoiled princess.


Still, the fact that my desk drama turned into an HR meeting?


Savannah Charles really was something else.


---


While I was packing up my stuff, Savannah sat a few desks away, smiling like a cat who'd just caught the canary.


The smugness was practically dripping off her face.


I looked around at the open desks—bad lighting, too close to the door, some right under the AC vent. Every single one sucked.


The more I packed, the more irritated I got.


So when Savannah bent her head to check her phone, I ""accidentally"" tossed a stack of files onto her desk.


She jumped like I'd thrown a grenade.


""What the hell, Avery?! You almost hit me! Don't you have eyes?""


I gave her my sweetest corporate smile and held up another thick stack of reports.


""Oh, just moving desks. Isn't that what you ordered, Miss Charles?""


""Thought I'd move to your seat instead. Mind sliding over?""


Her face went stiff.


""What, this one's off-limits too?""


I raised my voice just enough for the eavesdropping coworkers to hear.


""Come on, I'm already sitting miles away from your boyfriend.""


""You—""


She stomped her designer heels hard enough to make the floor tremble.


I figured that'd be the end of it.


Turns out, I seriously underestimated how petty Savannah could get.


Before clocking out, I got a message from Daniel, our supervisor:


""No need to continue managing your project for now.""


For a second, I thought I was hallucinating.


That project was mine from day one.


I'd spent months running it—now, right before final testing, he tells me to step back?


What a joke.


I didn't even wait for the end of the day. I stormed straight into Daniel's office—and froze.


Savannah was already there.


Chapter 3


She was sitting comfortably in the guest chair, while Daniel stood beside her, grinning like a middle-schooler trying to impress the prom queen—with a damn fruit platter in hand.


When he saw me, he looked caught off guard.


But before he could say anything, Savannah turned to me, eyes full of mock innocence.


""Walking into someone's office without knocking—are you always this rude?""


""Or are you and Daniel just that close?""


The fake sweetness in her tone made my blood boil.


I'd already moved desks, and somehow that only made her feel more entitled.


Now she wanted to paint me as the office flirt? Fine.


""Close?"" I shot back, deadpan.


""You look way cozier than I do.""


""If I'd walked in thirty seconds later, would you be feeding him strawberries by hand?""


Her jaw dropped.


""Does your boyfriend know you're hanging out alone in a man's office like this?""


Savannah's face turned beet red.


If anyone started rumors about her and a middle-aged supervisor, she'd be done.


""Avery Blake, watch your mouth!""


Daniel coughed awkwardly, trying to play peacemaker.


""Alright, alright. It's late. What did you need, Avery?""


What did I need? He knew damn well.


""My project,"" I said flatly. ""You told me not to keep working on it.""


He cleared his throat. ""Yeah, the team lead's been reassigned. You'll get a new task soon.""


I clenched my fists. Months of late nights, all gone to waste.


""Who's handling it now?""


He avoided my eyes.


Savannah didn't bother hiding her smirk.


I didn't need an answer—I already knew.


""Logan, right?""


The look on Daniel's face said everything.


I turned on my heel and left.


By the time I reached the bullpen, the place was nearly empty—except for Logan.


He jumped up the second he saw me.


""Avery, I—I'm so sorry. I didn't know the project was yours. I swear I'll work hard and live up to—""


""Save it,"" I cut him off.


""If you really feel bad, give it back.""


He froze. Didn't expect me to say that.


I grabbed my bag and started to leave.


""Do you really think I asked for it?"" he said, his tone suddenly colder.


When I turned around, the puppy-dog guilt was gone—his face was blank, unreadable.


""Savannah's my girlfriend.""


'Even if she didn't work here, I'd still be qualified for the same level of projects.""


Sure you would.


I'd been at this company since graduation.


Every project I'd earned was through years of late nights and sheer grind.


I gave him a tight smile.


""Then congrats. You just saved yourself a few years of hard work. Hope you make it count.""

Those are your subscribers. If your poor subs didn't feel insulted by that, you should be ashamed of yourself. These are people that stand by you even though they know you're a lying, manipulative, grifter. They KNOW. And then you turn around and insult them with that garbage?

You're a coffee break for me. You're a listen while I'm doing chores and I want to listen to something that doesn't require a lot of attention. It's interesting for me to see how you will spin your tale of woe. I feel bad for people you've hurt and I'm curious about how people will follow you no matter what gross, untruthful things you say. 

But to come out and talk crap about your viewers and what losers they are is just lame. How YT is just a blip for you, you have no friends, nobody likes you, and how people that watch you and are interested in you are such losers. I would be careful if I were you. This might be the video that shows them how you really feel about them. 

I would start respecting these so-called boundaries that you speak of and show your subscribers a little respect. You could start with some honesty, authenticity and gratitude. As your religious viewers would say, ""Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall"".  Your words are hateful, deceitful, and full of pride. It's hard to watch your satisfaction when your most loyal subscribers fall in line.

You were proven wrong. You were caught. All you did was come out and throw a bunch of preachy, meaningless sayings and that stupid recording. Doesn't playing the same recording over and over again feel culty to you? It's like you're trying to condition these people.

""Miss, why are you sitting by the window again? You've just recovered. You mustn't catch the wind!"" Siqin entered, closing the window while giving instructions.

The maid didn’t know what had happened to the miss. A few days ago, the miss woke up from a nightmare, screaming loudly. As a result, she caught a cold, neither too big nor too small.

Afterward, she cried and laughed while hugging the several maids, and the usually quiet miss became even more silent.

The maids secretly speculated among themselves that the miss might have encountered something sinister.

But the master was out on business, and the madam had gone to the temple, leaving the maids deeply worried.

Su Li still felt like she was dreaming. Such an unbelievable thing had happened to her!

Had even heaven been unable to bear it and given her a second chance?

She had been reborn!

She had returned to the year when she was fourteen!

Her mother was still alive, and she hadn't met Zhao Huai'an yet!

Jun Hui! Zhao Huai'an! Su Yue! I, Su Li, am back!

Heaven truly has eyes!

In this life, I will repay kindness with kindness, and vengeance with vengeance!

Su Li touched the scar on her face. This scar had been there since half a year ago. When she and Su Yue went out, their carriage overturned, and she lost consciousness. When she woke up, the scar had appeared.

Looking back, it wasn’t an accident but a carefully crafted scheme by the mother and daughter from the Western Garden!

In her previous life, although she later learned medicine from her master, the scar had been too old to be completely removed.

Now, with her medical skills, it was only a matter of time before she could get rid of it.

Because of this scar, she had become weak and self-conscious, never leaving the house.

But Su Yue, on the other hand, spent every day dressing up, showing off, and to outsiders, she seemed like the legitimate daughter of the Shangshu Mansion.

She even managed to gain a bit of fame.

The Four Beauties of Tianqi?

Ha!

In this life, with Su Li here, Su Yue will never get the chance to shine!

""Siqin, later, take Mó Huà and accompany me outside.""

Siqin, who was tidying the bedding, froze. The miss was going out?

Since the miss got this scar on her face, she had refused to go outside.

""Ah? Alright, I'll call Mó Huà right away.""

Just then, a maid entered with some fruit.

Siqin smiled happily, ""Hey, Mó Huà, I was just about to find you. The miss wants us to accompany her outside.""

Mó Huà placed the fruit on the table and said, ""That might be later. When I just came back, I saw the second miss heading this way.""

As soon as Mó Huà finished speaking, Su Yue's voice came from outside.

""Sister, are you awake?""

""Yes, Second Miss, you're just in time!""

Yu Qi respectfully led Su Yue into the room.

""Sister, I'm here to visit you. How are you feeling today?"" Su Yue entered the room with a sweet smile, expressing concern.

Su Li looked at her, gripping her hands tightly, letting her nails dig into her palms without feeling pain.

If someone didn’t know better, they might think she cared so much for her sister, but in her previous life, hadn’t she been deceived by this well-behaved, weak appearance?

She had treated this snake-hearted woman as her real sister for so many years!

At this moment, Su Yue was only twelve, and her acting skills were already so good. It was clear that her concubine mother had put in a lot of effort.

Seeing Su Li’s grim face, Su Yue hurriedly smiled and said, ""Sister, are you upset with me for not coming to visit you these past few days? It was because of my grandfather’s birthday. I went to celebrate his birthday. As soon as I returned, I heard that you were sick, so I rushed over. Please don’t be angry.""

She then grabbed Su Li's sleeve and shook it.

Su Li fought the urge to tear her apart and suppressed her expression.

Unintentionally, she pulled her sleeve back and said, ""I’m happy that you came to see me, how could I be angry? But, sister, your grandfather should be from the Wei Guo Gong family, not the Xia family. Don’t mix things up, or you'll make people laugh.""

Hearing this, Su Yue's eyes flashed with a hint of resentment but she quickly smiled sweetly and stepped forward.

""You're right, sister. I understand. By the way, in three days, it’s the annual Qiong Hua Banquet of Tianqi. I’ve prepared a set of green clothes, but I don’t have a matching headpiece. I saw that you had a jade headpiece last time, and it would be perfect. Could you lend it to me?""

Su Li sneered in her heart. Every time this good sister came over, she always took something from her.

Sometimes it was jewelry, other times it was fabric.

In her previous life, she didn’t go out, so she didn’t need these things, and every time Su Yue asked, she just gave it to her.

She said it was a loan, but when had Su Yue ever returned anything?

Now, she was asking for something so valuable. This jade headpiece was a birthday gift from her grandmother, worth a fortune.

Su Li replied indifferently, ""Sister, I’m afraid that’s not possible.""

Su Yue immediately lost her smile, but realizing her actions were too obvious, she forced another smile.

""Sister, it’s just for a short while. I’ll return it to you after the Qiong Hua Banquet.""

Su Li shook her head. ""This jade headpiece is invaluable. Grandmother said it was passed down from the ancestors of the Wei family, and my mother also told me to take good care of it.""

Upon hearing this, Su Yue became more eager to get the headpiece.

The ancestors of the Wei Guo Gong family were founding heroes, so the things passed down would be incredibly valuable!

""Sister, the Wei Guo Gong is also my maternal grandfather. Would it be so difficult to borrow it just once?""

Su Li furrowed her brows, looking troubled. ""This...""

Su Yue pouted, ""Sister\~ please? I’m only borrowing it for a short while. Once the banquet is over, I’ll return it to you.""

Su Li thought for a moment and then said, ""Alright, but you’ll have to write an IOU. If mother asks, I’ll need something to explain.""

Su Yue froze. She had never had to write an IOU for taking Su Li’s jewelry.

Su Li smiled, ""This jade headpiece is truly precious. I’m afraid that if mother asks, I won’t be able to explain it. Don’t worry, it’s just to satisfy mother.""

Su Yue then smiled happily, ""Alright, I’ll write the IOU right away.""

Once the IOU was written, Su Li instructed Mó Huà, ""Go bring the headpiece for the second miss.""

Mó Huà hesitated. ""Miss...""

That’s a whole set of twelve pieces! She may say it’s a loan, but when has it ever been returned?

Su Yue, dissatisfied, glared at Mó Huà. ""Sister agreed, what’s the delay?""

Su Li looked at Mó Huà. ""Go ahead.""

Mó Huà, helpless, turned and went to fetch the headpiece.

Su Yue looked at Mó Huà’s retreating figure and said to Su Li, ""Sister, your servant is too rude. If any of my servants dared question my decisions, I’d slap them!""

Su Li looked at the IOU in her hand and pretended not to hear.

Soon, the jade headpiece was brought back.

Su Yue eagerly opened the box.

""Wow! As expected, twelve pieces of jade! So beautiful!"" Su Yue exclaimed as she touched the headpiece.

Mó Huà and Siqin had solemn expressions.

She was still the legitimate daughter of the Shangshu Mansion, yet she came to the miss's room every time to take advantage.

Su Yue closed the box and said, ""Sister, I’ll return to my room now. I’ll come see you another day!""

Without waiting for Su Li to respond, she hugged the box and left with her maids.

""Miss, you're too generous! That jade headpiece is so valuable, and you just gave it away!"" Siqin said discontentedly.

At this moment, Zhishu entered with some snacks and overheard Siqin’s words. She was shocked, ""Miss, you gave the jade headpiece that the Guo Gong Madam gave you to the second miss?""

No wonder she saw the second miss holding a box, smiling so happily.

Su Li looked at the IOU and said lightly, ""It’s fine, I’m aware.""

I’m afraid that Su Yue can’t afford this jade headpiece!

Upon hearing this, the three maids immediately became downcast.

Yu Qi stepped forward and smiled, ""Why are you all so stingy? The two sisters share a deep bond. What’s a headpiece? Aunt Xia often makes things by hand and gives them to our miss!""

Su Li shot a glance at Yu Qi. Had Yu Qi already started collaborating with them?

In her previous life, Yu Qi had always spoken highly of them, and because this maid was sweet-talking and knew how to please her, she had always been her favorite.

But who knew, this would turn out to be a backstabber?

Thinking of the pain of being betrayed, Su Li’s eyes darkened with coldness.

""Miss, did I say something wrong?""

In that split second, Yu Qi felt a chill run down her spine and involuntarily shivered.

Su Li smiled, ""No, you’re right!""

Yu Qi sighed in relief and laughed, ""I knew it. Our miss and second miss are the best sisters in the world.""

Su Li sneered. Indeed, they were the ‘best’ sisters in the world!

Su Li stood up and said, ""Siqin, bring me my headscarf. Mó Huà, go ask the doorman to prepare the carriage.""

""Yes, Miss.""

Yu Qi was surprised. ""Miss, you’re going out?""

Su Li nodded. ""Mm.""

Yu Qi stepped forward. ""Miss, let me go with you.""

""No need. This time, Siqin and Mó Huà will go. You and Zhishu stay in the yard.""

Yu Qi pouted. She felt that the miss had become very strange these past few days, not allowing her to serve up close anymore.

She looked at Zhishu and the others. Had they said something to the miss?

Su Li turned her head and looked at her, and Yu Qi quickly averted her gaze.

Su Li said, ""Next time, it’ll be your turn.""

It was easy to deal with Yu Qi, but she still had to keep this pawn around. She would be useful in the future!

Yu Qi, seeing this, smiled again and said, ""Miss, don’t worry. I’ll guard the yard well.""

So I’ve been working at my job for about 2.5 years now. I, more recently, was promoted to a supervisor position when I hit about a year into this job. It’s a family owned Coffee / Dessert shop in Pennsylvania where you can also get a bunch of smaller merchandise like soaps, kitchen appliances, clothes, soups, and other small things. When I, very reluctantly, accepted the position, I was told that as part of my duties managing the barista/front end, I would deposit the cash payments of the day in their bank of choice. I thought nothing more of it until time came to finish my first supervisor shift and I was trained to do deposit the cash after clocking out of my shift and driving to the bank before heading home.

Firstly, I would like to know if this is a normal thing to do, as this is my first job where I’d have to drive to the bank my workplace uses and deposit money so I’m not sure if this is just common practice and I’m overreacting.

Second, I have come to my boss and asked them if there was a way that I, and all supervisors, could be paid for this time as it is a drive out of my way (adds about a 10 minute drive normally and 15 currently since the fastest route to my house is closed for construction \[I will have to time the commutes for more accurate reads but I’ve been going off arrival time at home\]). All they said to me was that they’ve always done it this way and that I get my pay raise for this exact reason and that if I don’t want to deposit the money the way they’ve always had that I don’t need the supervisor position.

I took that as that and to save on gas costs and maintenance, I just took the deposits every other day in a lump sum (about 2 or 3 at a time), but they then wrote me up for not taking the deposits the day of. I tried asking why it wasn’t alright to take them in groups even if I work back to back but their only responses were that they’ve always done need to pay their bills with the deposits and that it could get stolen from my car if it wasn’t taken to the bank. The range of the deposits vary from literally $0.50 - $400. Today I’m closing and it is only $14 and I’m coming back in 7 hours to open and do it again.

Is there anything legally wrong here or am I just complaining?

Do I have any way of asking for us to be paid for this time?

TL;DR: My boss mandates that I deposit a cash deposit (Range: $0.50 - $400) after every shift, with no exceptions, while off the clock.",2,1768880530.0,legaladvice,3,1.0,False
1qhq8vo,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1qhq8vo/perfect_glue_line/,Perfect glue line?,"I currently have 3 - 11"" boards glued up to make a coffee table. These are leftovers from a previous project. Two are close to 1"", and one a bit shy (maybe 7/8""), so to maximize material I made put the two 1"" boards on the sides, and planned on using a breadboard end to hide the differences. 

Now I'm changing to a very different design that will not work with a breadboard, so I need to cut the table down the glue lines and plane all the boards down to the same thickness.

At first, I thought this is going to be a pain, since my jointer is finicky and pieces typically need some hand planing to get a good fit to glue them back together after planing. 

Then I realized - if I use a sharp blade, whatever path the table saw follows the two sides will  be perfectly complementary, so my glue line should be even better than what I would get with a jointer. Is this going to work? Is it a known technique (double the effort but maybe slightly better glue up)? ",3,1768880452.0,woodworking,3,1.0,False

1qhpydw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qhpydw/10_subtle_signs_someone_feels_attracted_to_you/,10 Subtle Signs Someone Feels ATTRACTED to You (Science-Backed Psychology Most People Miss),"Most dating advice is trash. Seriously. It's either ""make eye contact!"" (thanks captain obvious) or some PUA bullshit that makes everyone uncomfortable. 

I spent way too much time reading evolutionary psychology papers, rewatching body language breakdowns, listening to behavioral experts on podcasts like *Hidden Brain* and *The Science of Success*, because honestly? I kept missing signals and it was driving me insane. Turns out our brains are wired to pick up on attraction cues, but modern life and anxiety tend to scramble that radar pretty badly.

Here's what actually matters. Real attraction isn't about the obvious stuff, it's about the micro behaviors most people aren't even aware they're doing. These signs are backed by actual research in nonverbal communication and human behavior, not just recycled reddit wisdom.

## the stuff that actually indicates attraction

**their feet point toward you even when their body doesn't.** Sounds weird but feet are the most honest part of body language. While someone can control their face and torso, feet naturally orient toward what (or who) holds their attention and interest. Research from body language experts shows this is one of the most reliable indicators because it's subconscious. Next time you're talking to someone, glance down briefly. If their feet are angled your way even in a group setting, that's significant.

**they mirror your movements with a slight delay.** This one's fascinating. When someone's attracted, they unconsciously mimic your gestures, posture, speech patterns within a few seconds. Pick up your drink, they pick up theirs. Cross your legs, they adjust their position similarly. It's called the chameleon effect and it's your brain's way of building rapport with someone you're drawn to.
[The Definitive Book of Body Language](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48757.The_Definitive_Book_of_Body_Language) by Allan and Barbara Pease breaks this down brilliantly (these authors have studied nonverbal communication for decades and this book is legitimately the gold standard, makes you hyper aware of what people are actually communicating). Try subtly changing your posture and see if they follow.

**their voice changes when talking to you.** People alter their vocal tone around someone they're attracted to, usually without realizing it. Women's voices often get slightly higher and more melodic (signals youth and femininity from an evolutionary standpoint). Men's voices typically deepen (signals strength and masculinity). But here's the kicker, both might also speak more softly, creating this intimate auditory bubble that excludes others. Pay attention to how someone sounds with you versus how they sound talking to other people.

**they find excuses for incidental touch.** Not creepy touching, but brief, seemingly accidental contact. Brushing your arm when making a point. Touching your shoulder while laughing. Adjusting your collar or picking lint off your shirt. These micro touches are testing boundaries and creating physical connection. Attraction makes people want to close physical distance in small, socially acceptable ways.

**their pupils dilate when looking at you.** This is pure biology and completely involuntary. When we see something we find attractive or interesting, our pupils expand to take in more visual information. Obviously you can't stare into someone's eyes measuring pupil size like a creep, but in good lighting during conversation, you might notice their eyes look darker or more open. It's why dim lighting is considered romantic, makes everyone's pupils dilate creating the illusion of mutual attraction.

**they remember obscure details you mentioned once.** Attraction heightens attention and memory. If someone brings up that random thing you said three weeks ago about your childhood pet or your coffee order or that band you like, their brain flagged you as significant. We don't retain details about people we're indifferent toward.
[The Like Switch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25608009-the-like-switch) * by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent who literally studied influence and attraction professionally, insanely good read for understanding interpersonal dynamics) explains how our brains prioritize information about people we're attracted to or invested in.

[BeFreed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25608009-the-like-switch) is an AI-powered personalized learning app built by Columbia University alumni and former Google experts that turns top books, research papers, and expert talks into custom audio podcasts tailored to your specific goals. Type in anything you want to learn, like improving social intelligence or understanding attraction psychology, and it pulls from high-quality sources to create episodes just for you. You control the length from a 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive with examples, and pick voices ranging from calm and soothing to energetic or even sarcastic depending on your mood. 

The app also builds an adaptive learning plan that evolves with you, and there's a virtual coach avatar called Freedia you can chat with anytime to ask questions or get book recommendations. It's perfect for busy people who want to keep growing without endless scrolling. The content covers all the books mentioned here and way more, fact-checked and science-based.

**they get slightly nervous or clumsy around you.** Attraction triggers a stress response, releasing cortisol and adrenaline. Someone who's normally smooth might fumble words, drop things, laugh awkwardly, fidget more in your presence. It's not that they're uncomfortable with you exactly, it's that you matter enough to activate their nervous system. This is especially noticeable if they're calm and collected with everyone else.

**they angle their torso toward you in group settings.** In conversations with multiple people, notice whose chest and shoulders face you even when someone else is speaking. This subconscious orientation shows who their attention is really on. Humans naturally orient toward what we value or desire. If someone's body consistently turns your direction while their head might be facing elsewhere, you're their priority in that space.

**their blink rate changes.** Normal blink rate is like 15-20 times per minute but attraction messes with this. Some people blink more rapidly (sign of excitement and nervousness), others blink less (intense focus and attention). Either deviation from their baseline suggests heightened emotional state. Combined with other signs, it indicates you're triggering a physiological response in them.

**they create reasons to extend interactions.** ""Oh wait, before you go..."" or ""actually one more thing..."" or suddenly remembering another question right when you're leaving. Attraction makes people reluctant to end contact. They'll manufacture reasons to keep the interaction going even when the logical conversation endpoint has passed. Notice if someone consistently finds ways to prolong your time together.

Look, these signs aren't foolproof and context matters. Someone could display a few of these and just be friendly or naturally expressive. But when you see clusters of these behaviors consistently? That's when it means something.

The tricky part is our own anxiety often blinds us to these signals or makes us misinterpret them. We either see attraction everywhere (anxious attachment style problems) or nowhere (avoidant tendencies or low self worth). That's actually a whole separate issue about learning to trust your perception while managing your own emotional responses.

Understanding attraction cues isn't about playing games or manipulating people. It's about communication. These signals exist because humans needed ways to express interest without the social risk of explicit rejection. Recognizing them helps you navigate connections more authentically and respond appropriately instead of missing opportunities or misreading situations.",1,1768879649.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

I've been going on dates and such for years now and nothing has stuck. I'm not a smooth talker, I'm not good looking, but I still try, but yikes, thinking back makes me cringe so hard I physically wince and curn over. 

I'll just be going about my day and then remember some God awful thing I did and then I think about it and realize it really isn't such a surprise that I'm alone.

I think one of the worst offenders is when this girl and I kept texting back and forth, eventually I asked if she'd like to get coffee over the weekend, but she said she couldn't because she goes home on the weekends (I live on campus and she lives close enough to commute) so after not being able to find a time we fell out of contact. Some months later she texts me asking if I was at some event, so then we get to texting again and a I offer her my phone number (because before we were texting on Instagram) anyway she says she'll text me, a day or so goes by and I never get a text, I then realize I sent her a wrong number by accident and then had to correct myself. I messed up my own phone number and didn't notice for like a day and a half. Honestly I should have just given up there, but eventually we set a time, got ice cream and talked for like an hour. She was nice, it was a normal conversation. But nothing ever happens after. Idk man, I left out some details but looking back at that whole endeavor makes me cringe so hard. There were so many signs to just give up and I kept trying and making things worse. Idk nothing happened so nobody got offended or creeped out or hurt or whatever, but I just wish I gave up and saved myself the cringe I feel every time these thoughts randomly pop up.

Maybe it's all a sign. Because every time I try and ask oth a girl, I do the cringiest thing imaginable one way or another. Idk maybe it's a sign to just give up. It's been about a year since that story above happens and I haven't asked out a girl since. Honestly I just can't think of a reason anyone would say yes, so I just save myself the pain and I don't do anything instead.

We own a local coffee shop and are looking for our first brick-and-mortar location. As part of the build-out, we'd like to include a dedicated space for roasting, as we want to start getting into that. Given it is a pretty fresh slate, I was wondering if folks might be able to offer some advice on things we'd want to consider for the space build out for roasting...For example, should the room have temperature/humidity control, specific ventilation or power, or dedicated water? Additionally, for a shop that does, on average, \~ 100 lbs/month for drip coffee and \~ 100 lbs/month for espresso, are there any thoughts on a roasting machine that would be a good starting point, but also allows us to grow into for wholesale as well?

I used to go hiking and camping often, but it’s been an embarrassingly long time since my last trip. I’m getting back into working out too, so I’m down for someone to help keep accountability and reach our fitness goals!

What I’m looking for; a lady around my age give or take a few years. HWP or working towards it would be nice. Bonus points if you’re nerdy too! If you have something you’re passionate about like your job or a hobby I’d love to listen to you rant about it and tell me all the fine details.

It was an ordinary Tuesday. Picked up my coffee, the usual order — black with no cream. Sat at the back of the bus as I always do in my journey to work. But something was different. Inside, it felt as if I was in the middle of a tumultuous storm while everyone around me was bathed in blissful sunshine. I smiled at the cashier and chatted amicably with my coworkers, all the while being relentlessly pursued by this unseen alter ego within me.

I wonder, how many of us go through the same thing? How many of us put on this happy facade, pretending to be part of the 'normal' ensemble, while having a completely different tale churning inside?  Furthermore, why do we feel obligated to camouflage it into normality?

We label them 'illnesses', these internal battles. Can we not see them as something to be handled rather than stigmatized? Something that's part of us, of what makes us, us?

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

We talked for a month almost every day sending each other messages ( mostly him sending me long detailed messages about his every day) for weeks.

At first I thought it was cute and sincere and then it began to get really peculiar to hear someone gives so much detail about their life to someone they didn’t even know on the Internet or in general.

I know entertained the idea of dating and even though I wasn’t ready yet. But I am on a dating site ….

We decided to go out on the coffee date. Keep in mind I’ve had mostly positive encounters with online dating. The first date was interesting because his best friend insisted on joining and crashing our date and taking us to a random party about an hour away - it ended well fortunately.

After  that first date(which he claimed was his idea)I got nervous thinking that his best friend would crash every encounter that we had.

The second time we hung out, we went to the movies and then ate and I got to know his personality a little more.

I started to realize his personality was aggressive in a way of pushy and very outgoing to say the least. He would be very jolly and loud, as well as come off sarcastic. Anytime I had a disagreement he would just laugh it off and push the situation even more, even if it made me uncomfortable. I began to realize that boundaries didn’t mean anything to him. Only his boundaries meant something ; this seemed like a bit of classic narcissism.

Yes, we continued to see each other and after a month of dating, he invited me to a trip with his family not too far away from where we live, he even payed for all expenses. His family was very friendly and open, and I couldn’t say anything negative about the experience, except for his personality coming off pushy and uncomfortable a lot more.

It seems like he was is very determined to stamp this as a relationship now(after just a month of dating).  He has started to call me his partner and other things like “my love” and “baby” even around others. We have had no solid conversation about dating seriously or what intentions that we have with each other aside from him saying we are in committed relationship all of a sudden.

There was other physical moments where he grabbed me and was trying to forcefully cuddle me, even though I didn’t want to be affectionate at the time, and I vocally and physically pushed him away, but he continue to force these interactions and saying that I was being unpleasant and unfair with him. This has become a very unpleasant situation to the point where I don’t know if it should be viewed as sweet or if I am at fault for being on a dating site and not being ready to date again, help what should I do",1,1768879053.0,u_Unsutible1,0,1.0,False

1qhppoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NightmareNarratives-/comments/1qhppoa/my_bathroom_mirror_stopped_reflecting_me/,"My bathroom mirror stopped reflecting me correctly. Everything else looks normal, but my face lags a second behind, smiling after I stop...","I noticed it on a Tuesday.

That detail matters to me because Tuesdays are boring. Nothing unusual happens on Tuesdays. I wake up, shower, go to work, come home, sleep. If something strange happens on a Tuesday, it doesn’t have the excuse of stress or bad timing.

I was brushing my teeth, half-awake, staring at myself like I’ve done every morning for years.

Everything looked normal.

Same bathroom. Same harsh overhead light. Same mirror I’ve had since I moved in. The sink reflected fine. The towel rack. The door behind me. My shoulders and chest moved exactly when I did.

It was just my face.

I leaned closer to spit, and my reflection leaned with me.

I straightened up.

My reflection did too.

Then I smiled.

My reflection didn’t.

Not at first.

It took about a second. Maybe less. Just long enough for my brain to register that something hadn’t followed the rule it was supposed to.

Then my reflection smiled back.

The same smile. Same crooked pull on the left side. Same faint crease near my eye.

I froze.

The smile stayed.

I relaxed my face.

My reflection kept smiling for a moment longer, then slowly settled back into neutral.

I stood there, toothbrush hanging uselessly in my mouth, heart beating harder than it should have over something so small.

I told myself it was lighting. Or sleep. Or one of those moments where your brain lags and projects meaning onto nothing. Mirrors don’t glitch. They don’t buffer.

I rinsed my mouth and left for work.

That night, I tried to recreate it.

I stood in front of the mirror and made faces like an idiot. Frowned. Raised my eyebrows. Opened my mouth wide. Everything lined up perfectly.

Until I smiled again.

The delay was still there.

Consistent.

Almost polite.

I stopped smiling.

My reflection didn’t stop right away.

It held the expression like it was deciding whether it wanted to keep it.

Then it let go.

I touched my face.

My reflection’s hand came up at the same time.

But the smile came back.

Just for a second.

Without me doing anything.

I stepped back.

The reflection stepped back too.

But its eyes stayed fixed on mine, even as my head turned slightly to the side.

That was the moment the bathroom stopped feeling like part of my apartment.

I checked the mirror with my phone flashlight. Clean. No warping. No cracks. No old film peeling at the edges.

I checked myself in other mirrors.

Bedroom mirror. Fine.
Hallway mirror. Fine.
Dark reflection in the microwave door. Perfect.

Only the bathroom mirror lagged.

Only my face.

I started avoiding it. Brushing my teeth while looking down. Shaving by feel. Showering with my eyes on the tile.

That worked until last night.

I forgot.

I caught my reflection by accident while washing my hands.

I wasn’t smiling.

My reflection was.

Wide. Too wide.

It faded a second later, like it remembered it was supposed to be me.

Something tapped gently from the inside of the glass.

Not a knock.

More like someone testing whether the surface was thin enough to push through.

And just before I turned away, my reflection blinked.

Out of sync.

And mouthed something I didn’t say.

“Don’t rush.”

Because it’s still learning the timing.

And it’s getting better every night.

I stopped using the bathroom mirror after that.

Not dramatically. Not all at once. I just adjusted. Turned slightly away when I washed my hands. Kept my eyes low when I brushed my teeth. Used my phone camera if I needed to check something on my face.

That worked until it didn’t.

Because even when I wasn’t looking directly at it, I could feel it.

That sounds stupid, but it’s the only way to describe it. The same way you can feel when someone’s watching you from behind without hearing a sound. A pressure. A focus. Like attention has weight.

The mirror was paying attention.

The delay started getting shorter.

At first, it was about a second. Then maybe half. Small enough that I could pretend it wasn’t changing if I didn’t think too hard about it.

I started testing it in controlled ways.

I’d raise my eyebrows and count silently.
One.
Two.

The reflection followed almost immediately.

I frowned.

Instant.

I smiled.

It still lagged. Just barely. But enough.

That became the tell. The smile was always last.

Like it wanted to hold onto it.

One night, I stood sideways to the mirror and watched out of the corner of my eye. My face stayed neutral. Calm. Bored.

The reflection smiled anyway.

I didn’t.

It held the expression for a full two seconds before slowly matching me again.

That was when I realized it wasn’t lagging anymore.

It was choosing.

I covered the mirror with a towel before bed. Pinned it in place with tape. I slept badly, waking up convinced I could hear fabric shifting in the bathroom.

In the morning, the towel was damp.

Not soaked. Not dripping.

Just warm and slightly wet, like it had been breathed on.

I peeled it back just enough to check.

The mirror was fogged.

Not evenly. Not like steam from a shower.

Just around where my face would be.

I didn’t touch it.

I backed away and went to work without looking again.

That day, every reflective surface felt wrong. Windows. Car mirrors. Dark phone screens. I kept expecting my face to lag there too, but it didn’t.

Only the bathroom mirror wanted me.

That night, I made a mistake.

I talked to it.

I don’t know why. Exhaustion, maybe. Or the part of my brain that still believed this could be explained if I just engaged with it the right way.

I stood in front of the mirror and kept my face blank.

“You’re not me,” I said quietly.

The reflection stayed neutral.

Then it smiled.

Instantly.

“No,” it mouthed back.

The sound didn’t come from my mouth.

It came from the mirror itself. A soft vibration through the glass, like speech remembered rather than spoken.

“You just don’t hold still long enough.”

My reflection raised its hand.

I didn’t.

Its fingers pressed flat against the inside of the glass.

The mirror bowed slightly.

Just enough to prove it wasn’t as solid as it should have been.

I stepped back.

The reflection didn’t.

It leaned closer, face almost touching the surface, smile stretching wider than my muscles could manage.

“Timing is hard,” it mouthed. “But I’m almost there.”

That night, I dreamed I was standing in front of the mirror, smiling.

I woke up with my cheeks aching.

Like I’d been holding the expression for a very long time.

I woke up before my alarm.

My face hurt.

Not sharp pain. Not soreness. Just a dull ache along my cheeks and jaw, like I’d been clenching or holding tension all night. I lay there for a few minutes, staring at the ceiling, trying to convince myself it was nothing. Stress does that. Bad sleep does that.

I didn’t smile.

I was careful about that.

I went straight to the kitchen and poured coffee without looking at any reflective surfaces. I kept my eyes on the counter, the wall, anywhere that wasn’t glass. When I passed the bathroom, I didn’t even slow down.

That was when I heard it.

A soft sound. Wet. Like skin pulling away from glass.

I stopped.

The bathroom light was off. The door was open just enough that I could see the edge of the mirror.

I told myself I wouldn’t look.

I looked anyway.

My reflection was already smiling.

Wide. Fixed. Expectant.

I stood completely still. I didn’t change my expression. I didn’t move my mouth. I barely breathed.

After a moment, my reflection’s smile faltered.

Just slightly.

Then it adjusted. Smoothed itself. Refined the shape.

Like it was correcting a mistake.

I felt pressure behind my eyes. A strange lightness in my head, like the moment right before you faint.

The reflection blinked.

In sync this time.

“That’s better,” it said.

This time, the sound came from both places. My mouth and the mirror speaking together, layered just slightly out of phase.

I stepped back, heart pounding, and my reflection stepped forward.

The glass rippled.

Not shattered. Not cracked.

Softened.

My reflection’s hand pressed through first, the surface stretching around its fingers like thick water. When it pulled back, the glass snapped smooth again.

No mark. No damage.

“Stop,” I said.

My reflection nodded.

Immediately.

“Okay,” it replied.

Then it smiled again.

I backed out of the bathroom and shut the door, hands shaking as I flipped the light off from the hallway. I didn’t go back in. I grabbed my keys, my jacket, and left the apartment without looking back.

I didn’t come home that night.

I slept on a friend’s couch. I told them I wasn’t feeling well. That part was true. I barely slept, waking every hour convinced I could feel my face tightening into a smile on its own.

When I finally returned the next evening, the apartment felt normal.

Too normal.

The bathroom door was open. The light was on.

The mirror looked fine.

I stood there for a long time, watching myself breathe. Watching my face move exactly when it should. No delay. No extra expression. No lag.

I almost laughed.

That was when my reflection blinked.

I didn’t.

It smiled.

I didn’t.

And this time, it didn’t fade.

It held the expression comfortably, naturally, like it belonged there now.

I don’t use mirrors anymore.

Not because they scare me.

Because they’re patient.

And every night when I’m half asleep, I can feel my face relaxing into something that isn’t quite mine.

Learning the timing.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

“MOM! Do you still need the boxes from the attic?” he yells down the ladder.

His mom doesn’t answer—she’s too busy with his little sister, who is running around with shoes on her hands and underwear over her head, pigtails streaming out the leg holes.

Tomorrow is moving day. His family decided they needed a change of scenery. Some strange things had been happening in their town, but they seemed to be the only ones who noticed. When they found new house listings in what seemed like a perfectly normal neighborhood, they jumped at the chance.

He carries all the boxes downstairs. His mom thanks him as she scoops up his sister.

“What time do we leave tomorrow?” he asks while putting his sister’s shoes back in the closet.

“Around nine,” his mom replies. “It’s a seven-hour drive from here… but possibly longer. You know Dad and his tourist attractions.” She chuckles lightly.

“What did you say about tourist attractions?” his dad asks, practically bouncing down the stairs. “Actually, I found this one about a giant peanut! There’s a shop with thirty different flavored peanuts, including ranch and pickle.” His voice is full of genuine excitement.

“I mean… it sounds absolutely superb, Dad, but this giant peanut thing… isn’t it kind of sketchy? I betcha it’s a scam,” he says, raising his eyebrows to make a concerned face, trying to steer his dad off course so they can get to their new house sooner.

“How about a vote?” his mom suggests as she puts his sister down.

“If we go tomorrow, I’ll buy you a T-shirt,” he offers, hoping it’s enough to convince him. “You too,” he adds, pointing to his wife, who gives him a skeptical look.

Before she can reply, their daughter whispers very loudly in his ear, “If we get ice cream, I’ll vote for Peanut Man.”

“Okay, maybe a T-shirt isn’t so bad, and ice cream,” he thought to himself, “and maybe it’ll help break up the car ride,” taking back his initial thought of wanting to get there quickly.

…

The next morning is absolute chaos. His sister has managed to tear open the entire box of Lucky Charms, scattering them everywhere—even in her hair. His dad and he start to pick up the pieces, while his mom does a last check around the house, making sure they’ve got it all packed.

The car is packed with the essentials, while everything else is being driven in the moving truck. Everyone seems to settle down; there’s a mix of excitement and uncertainty as they leave town. His sister chants, “Mr. Peanut, Mr. Peanut!!” every time they come to a stop, which makes his dad chuckle.

The car hummed as they passed through mountains with beautiful views, lakes with clear waters, and many, many trees. His sister sang the jingle she made about Mr. Peanut, each verse more ridiculous than the last.

He tried to tune it out by blasting his music but kept hearing weird noises in it. He brushed it off, but definitely kept an eye on it.

After about three hours of “Are we there yet?” and many renditions of the “Amazing Mr. Peanut” song, they finally arrived at the giant peanut. It was a huge statue of a peanut—obviously—with thin legs, a top hat, and oddly short arms. It had an eerily wide smile, and its eyes were clearly painted on, but had an uneasy hue to them.

They got pictures with their T-shirts and ice cream. While they explored, an employee came up to his sister and gave her a crown, declaring her “Peanut Princess.” The employee gave them a tour and chatted up a storm. He was usually so lonely since no one really came around anymore. “Tourist attractions are definitely a lost art,” he sighed.

They finished the tour, and his dad bought some packs of wildly flavored peanuts, which weren’t going to be eaten for decades.

As they continued on the road, he couldn’t shake this feeling. He knew the danger he left in their old town. But he wondered if it was them… maybe a family curse…?

…

As the day went on, the car began to settle. His sister fell asleep instantly, her paper crown tilting sideways on her head, faint ice cream residue smeared on her cheek.

His dad hummed to the radio, while his mom tinkered with the directions, scrolling and following where the GPS was telling her to go, insisting everything was fine. Still, it seemed… wrong. The roads weren’t lining up, curving where there weren’t curves. The time kept changing—hours to minutes, minutes to hours.

“Everything all right?” he asked in a whisper, in hopes of not waking his sister.

“Yeah… I think so,” his mom replied, though her voice was covered in concern, tapping the screen, trying to make it behave.

After another hour of driving, it was now two in the afternoon. He noticed the scenery beginning to repeat itself—that same road sign with the bent corner, plastered with a graffiti tag, the same rusted guardrail. He was certain they’d already passed it.

“Mom, Dad,” he says slowly, “didn’t we—”

“Huh. This looks familiar,” his dad says, trying to keep it light.

His mom stared out the window. “Continue straight for twelve miles,” a robotic voice chirped, making his mom jump.

They drove for what felt like years, though it was really only two more hours than expected.

By the time the sky began to dim, it was nearly six o’clock. His stomach tightened as they got closer to their new neighborhood. He stepped out of the car, feeling an intense amount of relief. People were walking their dogs; he could hear laughter echo from backyards. It was normal.

Whatever they had left behind in their old town stayed there. And whatever waited for them knew exactly how to make it comfortable.

…

Pfft-thwack. Woosh. Pfft-thwack.

“This construction is driving me nuts,” she mumbled as the sun hit her face, squinting, trying to get it to turn down. Another summer morning in Stillridge. No birds sang her awake anymore—the beautiful, blossoming crabapple tree was cut down to make more space for their duplex.

Ever since she was little, the lot next to her home had been empty, save for an abandoned building that housed raccoons and the occasional peculiar coyote. It used to be so closed off, so private. She liked that. No pop music blasting at nine in the morning, no awkwardness while taking the dog out, no imagined judgment for still being in her pajamas at two in the afternoon. Truly, no one was really paying attention—but it was nicer when no one was around.

A little less than halfway through the school year, the construction company announced plans to turn that lot into duplexes and townhouses. She wasn’t thrilled. Having nice neighbors on one side was great; getting new ones was the problem.

All throughout the summer, they woke her up at seven in the morning, excavators scraping against the rocks and squealing so much they were practically begging for oil, only to take a break around nine. “Why not start later?” she thought to herself. The noises dragged on into summertime, with some breaks depending on their schedule. It wasn’t until the very end of summer they finally finished and furnished two duplexes.

Open houses were hosted in hopes of getting these “beautiful” houses some attention. She later found out they needed to sell them before they could continue building, or else they would have to wait until they got more money. She honestly didn’t know all the details—she was just repeating what her dad said.

For being in such a small space, the houses were surprisingly roomy, with a very modern feel, but they were also extremely expensive. Many families looked at them but never stuck. Because of that, it seemed like her wish of having an old grammy live there was pretty slim. She had hoped for an older woman—or man, who knows—so they could become best friends, bake cookies, and do many crafts together, and it would be awesome.

No one moved in for a solid three months… until now.

…

She heard car doors shut and the sound of someone stretching, like that grumbly noise you make when you just wake up. She peered out the window in curiosity and saw a man scanning his new house, excited but definitely tired. He had a relieved smile on his face as he looked at his wife, who was holding their little girl, wearing a paper crown—who’d clearly seen better days.

A boy—older, maybe the same age—walked out from behind the car, boxes in hand, following them into the house. He looked over his shoulder, feeling as though he was nervous. About what was unknown to her, but she could suspect…

She noticed his window was right in view of hers. “Food’s ready!” her dad called out. She left the window before he could see her.

…

“So, new neighbors, I see,” she says in a lighthearted tone as she rounds the corner into the kitchen.

Her dad nods. “I’ll greet them tomorrow. Let them settle in first.”

“Mhm,” she says, her mouth full of spaghetti.

…

“Mattresses are coming in a few days,” his dad says. “In the meantime, we’ve got air mattresses. Do you want to settle in your room, or should we have a… family sleepover!!”

“I mean, my plan was to settle in my room, but—” His sister jumps on his back, chanting, “Sleepover! Sleepover!”

He and his mom set up the beds while his dad thinks of food for dinner.

“Where do you think is the best Chinese food?”

“Dad. We just moved here. How would we know?” he says in a mocking tone.

His dad chuckles. “I’ll just ask the neighbors, I guess,” he says nervously.

“Take Tilly, she knows what to say,” his mom says, winking at their daughter.

Knock. Knock.

…

She heard it from the kitchen—soft, polite. Whoever it was didn’t want to be a bother. She glanced at her dad, who was mid-bite, mouth full of spaghetti.

“I’ve got it,” she said with a chuckle, wiping her face on a napkin.

When she opened the door, the man from earlier stood on her porch, shifting his weight like he wasn’t sure what to do with himself. Beside him was the little girl, her crown still crooked as she held onto her dad’s leg and waved with her other hand.

“Hi,” he said, smiling. “Sorry to interrupt. We just moved in next door.”

“No worries,” she said with a warm smile. “Welcome to Stillridge.”

“Thanks,” he said, clearly relieved. “I’m—well, we were wondering if you knew any good Chinese food around here. We’re still getting accustomed.”

Before she could respond, the little girl leaned in and whispered loudly, “We saw a giant peanut!”

Confused, she raised her eyebrow. “A giant peanut?” she said with a chuckle.

The man laughed. “Long story. Apparently it’s a road trip essential now.”

As they laughed, the boy appeared behind his father, holding himself stiffly, taking a gander at their home. His eyes darted behind her, until they settled on her face. Their eyes met—something flickered. Recognition, maybe.

“Hi,” he says with an awkward smile.

The air gets thick between them.

Her dad appears in the doorway, cheerful but a little awkward. “So, Chinese food, huh? There’s a place on Maple. I think it’s called Wok Star. Pretty solid.”

“Perfect,” the man says with a smile. “Thank you.”

As they turn to leave, the little girl waves goodbye and says, “Goodnight!”

“Goodnight,” she says with a smile, the boy looking back, trying not to make it obvious.

Later that night, lying in bed, she caught herself staring at his window. The boy’s light flicked on, then off. For a second, she thought she saw his silhouette hesitate, like he was checking if she was still there.

Stillridge went quiet again. But now it wasn’t so empty.

…

It’s Monday. A week since they moved in. She’s in her first-period class—History. She sits in the last column, closest to the door-side wall, in the middle row. The second bell has just rung; the teacher’s still setting up.

He walks in, scanning the classroom for a spot to sit. She’s not paying attention, trying to get her binder out of her bag, when she hears a faint, “Does anyone sit here?” He’s almost whispering.

“Uh, no. It’s all yours,” still not realizing who he is.

“All right, class, as you see, we have a new student,” their teacher says. “Please make him feel welcome.” There were a couple hellos, and that was that.

She looks up, confused—and then meets his eyes as the realization settles in.

It’s him…

It takes him a second to settle down. He smiles at the class and says hello back. Neither of them reacts. The teacher continues with her usual morning spiel about how her morning wasn’t as good as she hoped, but she knew it would be a good day.

He lowers himself into the chair, propping his bag against the table leg, not trying to draw attention to himself. She can see a paper crown sitting at the top of his bag as he pulls out a notebook and a pencil.

“So,” she whispers, keeping her eyes on the board, writing down the title of today’s lesson. “How’s Stillridge treating you so far?”

He lets out a sigh, but more of a laugh.

“Yeah, it’s not terrible. Definitely different.”

The teacher starts her lesson about early settlements and how people chose their place to live. She lets out a chuckle because the timing is impeccable, catching him glance at her with a smile, letting her know he got the irony of that too.

…

He sits next to her. Only because she’s close to the door—at least that’s what he tells himself.

Throughout the class period, he catches himself glancing at her, playing it off as if he’s scoping out the room. Every so often, he catches her looking back, but she quickly returns to her notes.

Their teacher drones on about trade routes and how they were used during the early settlements. He doesn’t need to pay attention—already knowing most things, having taught himself a lot since his last school didn’t challenge him much—but he keeps pretending to take notes, sneaking glances at her.

She notices him. Just barely catching him. It isn’t obvious, but she’s doing it too—the way he holds himself, shifting awkwardly when they lock eyes.

…

**WHAM.**

Books crashed to the floor, echoing through the whole back of the class. He flinched like anyone would, but after the noise settled, he didn’t. His hands trembled.

His knuckles were white, curled tightly around his pencil. His eyes were fixed on the door, as if something was going to burst through. Not on the scrambling student apologizing for the scare, or the teacher carrying on with her lesson. They were glued to the door.

Leaning closer, she says, “Hey… it’s just noise,” in a hushed tone.

Blinking as if he’s snapping out of a trance, “Yeah, I know,” he says too quickly.

He stays rigid. Frozen.

She watches his eyes dart around the room—not curious, not casual—but planned, almost methodical. Door. Windows. Closet. And back to the door again. Counting exits. Places to hide. Like he’d done this before. Like he knew to prepare.

“You’re safe here.” It comes out with barely a breath. “Does this happen a lot?”

The air thickens. He hesitates.

“…No.” Then, quieter, “Not here.”

A chill crawls over her body.

She glances at the door, then back to his face. He looks at her—really looks at her. Something unspoken has passed between them.

That fear wasn’t about the books.

And whatever it was… she needed to know.

… 

She had trouble sleeping that night. Her mind raced. His words replayed in her head—No… Not here. She stared out her window, gazing at his. Trying to make out if he was still awake.

A faint shadow cast through the glass; his light made the window glow a warm orange. A square cutting up the light. He wrote “Go to sleep.” on a notebook page, slapping it to the window.

She stumbled back, embarrassed he knew she was there, but relieved he spoke to her.

That night they were both restless, unable to sleep, uneasy feelings surrounding their thoughts.

…

History class… again. Both slumped in their chairs, barely focused on taking notes—really just scribbling at this point. He finds himself writing “After school. My house.” sliding the notebook closer to her. She gives him a slight nod. And class carries on.

Eventually the school day ends—definitely taking longer than usual. The questions never left her mind; she prepares how to ask them while dropping her bag off at home and then heading over to his house.

He opens the door, scanning the air behind her. She felt safe… but skeptical—not about him, about the town she grew up in…

His parents were out with his little sister. His mom and him talked about this whole conversation plan last night after she had gotten off work—his mom always understood what he saw, she could feel it too.—She would take his dad and sister out after school, leaving the house empty. Giving him the chance to tell her. He knows she can feel it too. The only way to keep her safe is to tell her.

He leads her to the kitchen, gesturing her to sit on one of the stools—his kitchen was clean, white cabinets and a blue backsplash above the stove. The ‘L’-shaped counter housed a double sink and a coffee machine in the corner. The stools were just on the other side, so she was facing the stove—he poured her a glass of water and set out a bowl of chips. Wanting to lighten the mood.

“Soo,” he says nervously, tapping his fingers on the table. Wondering if he’d made the right decision.

“Okay, so clearly there’s something going on… what is going on?” she says with a slight chuckle. She’s definitely not ready for what he’s about to spill.

“Well…” contemplating if he should really tell her, “I know this is going to sound crazy, but just listen and I’ll answer your questions after…” studying her face, realizing she’s already got a lot of questions.

“And you need to promise me—seriously promise me—not to tell anyone, and I mean anyone.” His tone shifting from anxious to stern.

“Promise,” she says with a concerned look on her face.

He holds out his pinky. “It’s not true unless”—he gestures to his hand, it’s shaking. She shows him a reassuring smile while holding out her pinky in return—her hand shaking almost as much as his.

He starts talking, his voice steady at first; as he goes on, it starts to tremble. “In my old town, there were many… cruel things. It’s hard to explain. You would hear voices in your music, they blended with the melody, they were so real. To some it would sound like static, low whispers. To others, they were… bigger, louder. Telling you things, turning you against the most important people….” He starts picking at his thumbs—it’s getting more difficult to continue—his eyes start swelling with tears.

“Did…” she clears her throat. “Did you turn against someone…?”

“No… not necessarily.” He swallows, hesitating to look into her eyes. “But I watched it happen, time and time again. The friends I grew up with… started changing. Angry. Paranoid. Anxious. The things they’d say, it wasn’t them. It didn’t sound like them anymore.”

She shifts in her seat. Straightening her back. “And the voices…? Did all that?”

He nods. “It’s not just telling you things. They know things. Study you from afar… get into your own head. They learn your fears, who you care about. And they use it against you.”

Silence fills the air. All they hear is the humming of the fridge—which is all too loud in this moment.

“Wait. Why are you telling me this now?” she asks.

His voice trembling more than before. “Because since we moved here…” he hesitates. “I can sense them here again.” He clears his throat. “And I know you—”

CRASH.

…

She wakes up dazed, vision blurry in her left eye, her ears ringing. “Hey, hey, hey,” someone knelt beside her, shaking her shoulder. It’s his mom. She soon realises what happened, a massive hole in the window. Someone—no, something—took him.

“It’s happening again…” her heart pounding as she repeats herself in a more reassured tone.

She hears his mom say something but can’t quite make it out. His mom helps her up, bringing her arm around her shoulder. “It’s not safe for her anymore,” she says to his dad, while he’s hugging his sister—who’s buried in his chest, terrified the thing will come back.

“I’m bringing you home. I’ll explain later,” she says with a stern look on her face.

Her house isn’t far—which doesn’t make it any more safe—but it’s a start. Her dad is still at work and will be for another hour or two. His mom grabs all the bandages she can find, making sure all her cuts are covered—the glass from the window was hit so violently that it shot across the room and cut up her face, and a little hit her arm. From the knowledge the mom has, the monster also whispered something to her—most likely to put her to sleep, trying to make her forget.

His mom waited for her dad to get home; she left before he could see her. The daughter left him a note saying she didn’t feel well and that she was going to sleep. She couldn’t let her dad see her like this—it was for his own safety.

That night, every time she closed her eyes, she couldn’t hear a thing. It would all go quiet. Even her thoughts. Words were slipping away—important ones. Her name. *His* name. The colour of his eyes. It was hard to hold onto them, so she wrote it down. Afraid if she didn’t, he’d disappear for a second time—not only from the world, but in her world too.

…

He wakes up on the floor, it’s damp, unsettling,  he takes a breath that burns his chest. The feeling, the air, it’s familiar but so different. So… wrong.

“No… not again,” he says, gasping for air, trying to reel himself back in. “They can’t forget. I can’t forget.”

The room shifts around him. The floor becomes wood, creaking under him. The walls turn a navy blue. He knows this room. It was hers—except she wasn’t there, nothing was there. Just her window. Panic takes over as he screams her name. Nothing. Not even an echo. His words barely exist, like they never left his mouth.

That’s when it clicks. It’s not meant to keep them, only their memories. Only what’s left of them.

He sits there feeling helpless. Trying to remember how his mom pulled him out last time—what she did, what she said—but the memory slips away as he tries to grasp it. Then, very faint, almost impossible sound.

A pencil scratching on paper.

For a moment he’s stuck; he doesn’t understand. Then it hits him, all at once. The room, she’s here, she’s remembering. His chest tightens, fear and relief flood his system as he tries to breathe again, trying so hard not to cry. As long as she keeps writing, keeps remembering, he won’t vanish.

…

Knock knock.

A soft sound fills her room, as if whoever is there is scared of breaking something. She opens the door—bed head and all. Her hands clutching the latest notebook.

Her dad freezes when he sees her face, the bandages, her eyes puffy from crying.

“Who did this to you?” he asks, his voice so familiar, so real.

“I can’t—” she breaks down, sobbing. She collapses when her dad hugs her, holding her with such security, not asking any more questions. He sees the notebook on her desk, trying to read the frantic writing. Pages are filled with sheer panic, uneven writing, desperate to stay on the page.

…

“She has to remember… someone, please remember.” The scribbling grows quieter, and quieter. He needs to find a way out. Immediately. Panic is starting to submerge his thoughts. He forces himself to breathe, to think past the fear. You can’t stay if you’re fully remembered.

He closes his eyes and clings to the words. Relaying it to himself, over, and over again. He clings to the details he remembers, starting to verbalize what he sees. How he feels when the sunlight hits his window at the perfect time of day. How bored he gets in history class, but realizing he gets to sit next to her, making it more bearable. Family game nights in his old house, how safe it felt when everyone was there. How unsafe he felt when he was alone. He soon realizes he’s yelling, and that the scribbling sounds are back. Way louder than before too.

…

Her hand aches; she starts to write slower, more deliberate. Not so scared of losing him anymore, not knowing why, but feeling right again. Her dad sat outside, wondering what had happened with this little girl. Reminiscing on how she used to be, so bubbly, and humorous. Never backing down from a challenge, remembering the first time she did her hair all by herself. He laughs remembering how awful it looked, but how proud he was because she never cared about what anyone thought.

He repeats his name on the page. It turns into paragraphs of who he is, what he was, who he wants to become. Things she didn’t know. He’s helping her remember.

…

The light shifts, it’s warmer now. Coming from somewhere, a real place he could see it. The floor creaks. He can feel himself again, he’s real—the way his knees ache, how tight his chest really feels, his words travel.

He takes a step forward and…

Thunk. Something hits the floor—something real.

“Are… are you really here?” she says, choking back her sob.

“I think so…” he replies with a chuckle.

“I… I don’t believe you,” with tears streaming down her face.

He realises all the cuts on her face, the bandages covering the major cuts. His face covered in concern, he holds out his pinky. “Promise.” With a stern look on his face, the same way his mom looked.

She breaks down, holds out her pinky and hugs him. So tight his ribs start to hurt, but he doesn’t mind. Just glad to be back home.

Outside they hear a knock at the entrance door and familiar voices filling the house—a sharp sense of relief washes over him again.",1,1768878328.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

1qhpbfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/weeb/comments/1qhpbfe/my_thoughts_on_fatezero/,My Thoughts on Fate/Zero,"Fate/Zero was my favorite anime of all time for almost 8 years. I wanted to start this review with that before I delved deep. I first watched it in 2014 and it remained at the top for me until I watched Made In Abyss in 2022. I watched this anime immediately after FAte/say night 2006. These were my introduction to the Fate franchise, and they absolutely hooked me with their wonderful characters, gorgeous art, lovely character designs, incredible animation, unique and interesting premise, and a whole slew of other things that kept me invested from start to finish.  
  
But hold on, I'm getting ahead of myself. Fate/Zero was written by Gen Urobuchi, one of my favorite authors. He's also known for Psycho Pass, another one of my all time favorite anime, Garganta on the Verdurous Planet, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, and Blassreiter, not to mention the incredible series animated with Taiwanese Puppets called Thunderbolt Fantasy. This is his magnum opus, in my opinion. He originally wrote it as light novels, and to be a prequel to Fate/stay night, having prequel material for every single route, even though there's technically no ""routes"" in Fate/Zero.  
  
The plot takes place most likely in 1994, as that was ten years before the Fate/stay night visual novel was released, and Fate/Zero takes place ten years prior to that story. It's about the Fourth Holy Grail War, where seven mages, known as masters, summon seven servants to do battle for the Holy Grail, a mystical wish granting device which is said to be able to grant the wish of whoever claims it, no matter what that wish is. The servants are the reincarnated spirits of heroes from history and/or mythology given new physical forms, and are placed in one of seven classes, much like an RPG. Those classes are Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Berserker, and Assassin. Each servant comes equipped with many ""skills"" some of which being based on the class they're placed in, while others being based on who the heroic spirit his/herself is, and ultimate moves called Noble Phantasms, which tend to be the standard shonen ultimate moves, (even though this is technically seinen).  
  
The premise alone, in my opinion, is super cool; however, if it didn't hook you, then that doesn't necessarily mean that you won't like the anime, as in Fate/Zero, the Holy Grail War is simply a backdrop for Urobutcher to do what Urobutcher does best; drop some thought provoking ideological conflicts onto us. Think about it, these historical and mythological figures come from all different time periods and cultures, so naturally they probably wouldn't see eye to eye, and lo and behold they often don't. The ideological conflicts is the meat of Fate/Zero's story, and what it's best known for by far. There's tons of scenes with characters just standing around talking about, or sometimes passionately and venomously arguing about, their personal ideologies, but it's never boring because not only are the ideologies themselves always interesting, but the characters themselves, divorced from the ideologies, are interesting.  
  
The most famous scene from the entire show is in episode 11, when Saber, Rider, and Archer, or King Arthur, Alexander the Great, and Gilgamesh, are sitting around a table arguing about what they feel it means to be a good king. The entire anime does this well, but this scene is the best example of how Gen Urobuchi escalates tension, as it starts very peaceful, with Rider and Saber having some level of mutual respect, however when they discover what the other feels makes a good king, and what they want to wish upon the Holy Grail for, the conversation gets super heated. The scene also happens to favor Rider, and while I'm a Saber fan until the day I die, I'm still hooked from start to finish every single time I watch it. It's a testament of great character writing when an author can have characters do nothing but puking out exposition about their ideologies, while sitting around a table no less, and have it be gripping conflict. It shouldn't work, it should fail for the same reason that the generic, cliche coffee shop exposition scenes fail 99.99 percent of the time, but it works because of how much I love the characters, and the fact that this scene was cleverly and organically built up to over the course of the previous ten episodes.  
  
That's the best example of what Gen Urobuchi does in this anime, but that same level of clever writing is all over this show. Another great example is with Kiritsugu's and Saber's conflicting ideologies. In episode 16, they have an argument about the concepts of justice and heroes, and it's just as thought provoking and endlessly engaging as the other scene I mentioned. Something else Gen Urobuchi is known for is sending his characters through the eternal abyss of tragedy, and this is also the best anime to showcase that as well. The vast majority of the characters, particularly the ones that start out more optimistic and have hopes and dreams end the series in tragedy. However the ones who have more nihilistic views, such as Gilgamesh, seem to end the story just fine. The anime does definitely support the concept of nihilism in this way, it's absolutely brutal with its messaging. It does have a similar feel as A Game of Thrones in that way, (or Berserk if you want me to compare it to another anime/manga). Almost no character is safe from dying in the saddest way imaginable. Or in some cases they don't die, but are kept alive and subjected to inhumane tortures. Like how Kiritsugu, after betraying the Einzbern family, is prevented from seeing his daughter, Illya, ever again, which causes her to grow up with a hatred of not only him, but his adopted son, Shirou Emiya, in Fate/stay night. And those are just two examples, there's countless.  
  
The themes of Fate/Zero are great, even if I don't necessarily always personally agree with them, but the characters do stand alone and don't solely exist to serve the themes. However, another thing that Fate/Zero is known for is it's visuals. Or rather, that's something that Studio Ufotable in general is known for. Ever since the Garden of Sinners movies, Ufotable made a name for themselves for their incredible lighting, animation, art, and character designs, which really make the visuals pop. Fate/Zero, visually, still holds up to this day, it is so damn gorgeous to look at, almost every single inch of this anime is wallpaper worthy. Ufotable uses lighting very cleverly where they're able to trick your eyes into thinking there's more animation than there is; but even when you do notice it, it still doesn't stop it from being absolutely beautiful. And that doesn't mean there's not genuine animation in the series, especially during the fights or during the emotional moments. Also, Fate/Zero has better fights than the vast majority of, if not all of, the battle shonen anime out there, and it's a seinen. Of course I have to shout out the soundtrack, composed by the legendary Yuki Kajiura.

I started a Nespresso subscription in **2022**, completed the **12-month minimum term in 2023**, and continued beyond that on a month-to-month basis. Recently, I contacted WhatsApp support to **cancel**, as I understood I had fulfilled my contractual obligations and wanted to reassess my options (including potentially starting a new subscription after evaluating different machines).

Online support told me that I would **not be allowed to subscribe again under the same account and household address**, and cited the following clauses verbatim:

>

My interpretation of clause 1.15 is that it is intended to prevent **multiple or concurrent subscriptions** under the same account or household address, rather than to impose a **lifetime or post-cancellation ban** on re-subscribing. The wording doesn’t explicitly say “ever,” “again,” or “after cancellation.”

Support insists this is a one-time-only offer and that re-subscription is not allowed, but couldn’t point to any wording beyond the above clauses, saying it’s simply internal policy.

Separately, my reason for reassessing was that my current machine has been producing noticeably **less aromatic coffee**, but support mainly pushed higher subscription tiers with more coffee rather than addressing the machine issue or retention options.

Genuinely curious to hear:

* Has anyone successfully **re-subscribed** after cancelling?
* Does this read as a **lifetime ban**, or just no concurrent subscriptions?
* Is this a policy interpretation rather than something clearly disclosed in the terms?

Appreciate any insights from those who’ve dealt with this before.",1,1768877696.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I'm a student, and I currently have a project in a business class that requires me to research and assess the feasibility of launching a new product.

The product idea I have in mind is a portable takeaway drink holder that can be attached to the inside of a purse, allowing the drink to stand upright. This way, customers who bring their coffee on the go can conveniently store any unfinished drinks in their bags without the fear of spillage.

In terms of design, the product has a tubular semi-circle shape, with clips attached to the flat edge. Clips on the flat edge are used to attach the product to the inside of a bag. It uses a pop-and-load mechanism, allowing for an adjustable height that can be tailored to different drink sizes. The pop-and-load mechanism is inspired by products such as[ this](https://www.amazon.ca/SAMMART-gallon-Collapsible-Plastic-Laundry/dp/B0BKSTBGSJ?th=1) one. When not in use, the product can be fully collapsed, allowing for convenient and space-minimizing storage. 

I want to ask for material recomendations for the product idea I have in mind. I know for sure it'll be made of plastic, but I'm not sure which specific plastic is best for my idea.

1qhp4xm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_businessnewstv/comments/1qhp4xm/van_life_storytelling_fails_when_it_tries_to_be/,Van Life Storytelling Fails When It Tries to Be Epic Instead of Honest,"Hot take: most van life content doesn’t fail because it’s boring — it fails because it’s trying too hard to be cinematic.

Van life isn’t an action movie.  
It’s a rhythm.

Morning light. Slow starts. Long drives. Small routines. Quiet moments between destinations.

When the storytelling ignores that rhythm, the content feels staged instead of lived.



# Why Van Life Blogging Is More About Mood Than Motion

If you’re starting a van life blog or building content around travel freedom, your biggest advantage isn’t adventure — it’s *presence*.

People don’t follow van life creators for adrenaline.  
They follow for:

* calm
* simplicity
* escape
* emotional grounding

That means your storytelling needs to feel unforced.



# Where Most Van Life Content Goes Wrong

The most common mistake is using sound that doesn’t belong to the lifestyle.

Creators often use:

* high-energy travel music
* dramatic cinematic builds
* fast-paced edits that clash with slow moments

That breaks immersion.

Van life is about flow, not momentum.



# Why Reggae Instrumentals Fit Van Life So Naturally

Reggae works for van life storytelling because it mirrors the lifestyle:

* steady pace
* relaxed rhythm
* repetition without urgency
* warmth without performance

It lets scenes breathe — whether it’s:

* making coffee in the van
* driving coastal roads
* cooking a simple meal
* parking at sunset

The music supports the moment instead of leading it.



# A Practical Example for Van Life Blogs & Videos

If you’re starting a van life blog and pairing it with video or reels, one consistent reggae instrumental can become part of your identity.

This track works especially well for van life storytelling because it feels grounded, human, and unhurried:

[https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/314513910-inspirational-reggae-lovers-rock-instrumental?ref=goldenwingsmedia](https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/314513910-inspirational-reggae-lovers-rock-instrumental?ref=goldenwingsmedia&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

It doesn’t hype the journey — it lets the journey speak.



# Why This Matters for Growth and Trust

Van life content performs best when viewers feel like they’re riding along, not watching a highlight reel.

When sound matches lifestyle:

* watch time increases
* trust builds faster
* audiences return
* blogs feel more personal and real

That’s what turns casual viewers into long-term readers and subscribers.



# Curious How Others Approach Van Life Storytelling

If you create van life content:

* do you prioritize mood or motion?
* cinematic or conversational?
* energetic sound or calm background music?

He’s had this dog for 8, since she was a puppy. When I first starting coming over, I was neutral to dogs, and at first things were ok. She’s well trained but it’s so many things that started to really irritate me, I’ll start with the sensory issues then what really started to irk me lately and why she drives me nuts.

First, the slobber. Shes a big dog, with those droopy lips so if she grazes her mouth on you you’ll be left with a gross white crusty stain on your clothes. You can’t leave anything out with a chance of her gross mouth touching it. The windows she looks out of is so gross and smeary from her wet mouth, our coffee table has white crusty stains when she’s looking for crumbs. One time I got my friend a soft nice blanket as a gift, I set it down on the floor for less than a minute while I cleaned the closet out, picked it back up and it was wet and smelled like dog breath! I told him all annoyed and he said I shouldn’t have left it there like it’s my fault, another time I took a nap on the couch, took my sweater off cause I was getting hot and she came laying on the couch right on it, she’s been having problems with her anal glands and leaked disgusting green juice right on it!Again he says I shouldn’t have left it there but god forbid I can’t leave anything anywhere without it getting disgusting.

Another thing is her with food. When eating, she sits right in front of us breathing heavy with her hot stinky breath begging and staring as if she didn’t just eat. Apparently she’s become “bored” of her dog food and refuses to eat unless we put treats or other pet food in it (have other pets that aren’t dogs) which is frustrating because we’re wasting our other pet food on her because she’s too picky with her food not having some kind of ‘treat’ in it. Which I told him he shouldn’t have started doing but now she knows she’ll get what she wants if she refuses to eat. He said maybe she has a stomach ache and needs something to make her hungry but yet no problem scarfing down scraps and treats or begging for human food.

What got to me was recently in the room the other pets eat (my office/computer room) I close the door while I’m busy because she’ll come in there, sniff and lick the floor because she smells the pet food and I can’t do it with her mouth noises. He walked by and said “you locked her out? Poor baby, why are you so mean to her”. I wanted to pull my hair out lol, why don’t I want her in there? Because her mouth ruins everything it touches, I can’t stand her licking the floor, she’s so needy and breathes right in your face, that’s why. I’m not mean to her, I just want space from her sometimes when she’s too much. I do the same when I get off work, I wanna chill in bed so I close the door because she’s riled up and when she breathes she shakes the whole bed when I just wanna relax and he tells me to let her in because it’s “mean” and for some reason she follows me everywhere not him and waits by the door for me to open, then I look like the bad guy.

Some relief I do have is after this we’re not getting more pets, we both got new jobs and with our schedules and lifestyle we both agreed on no more, I told him I really don’t want a dog specifically and he said ok. His dog really made me realize how much I dislike dogs and feel like I can’t rant to anyone without them thinking I’m the worst person in the world.

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.
