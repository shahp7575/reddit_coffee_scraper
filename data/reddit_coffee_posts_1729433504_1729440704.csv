I've had many occasions being around people drinking. Early on I had some anxiety over it but that seemed to have passed. I don't go out of my way to be in these scenarios but I also am not avoiding them as I feel it's a part of life. 

Yesterday I was at a brewery with my wife and her parents. Suddenly we ran into someone we knew and then a few more others were invited. I think a lot of it had to do with not seeing most of these people since I stopped drinking. 

For whatever reason, I got anxious. I noticed they had coffee there so I got one of those after having an NA beer. The coffee just made me more anxious all day. 

Long story short, I survived a day out with some surprise guest drinkers. It was very unpleasant but I am glad I didn't drink in the end. ",1,1729440528.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

I've designed and created the app myself.  
My wife and I have filmed a lot of demo videos for it in a completely fake kitchen set in my basement. (our real kitchen sucks)

I think the product looks good, and that's the feedback from other people. the product is real, it works and works well and other people have used it and there will be atleast 1 3rd party review video at launch.

As of right now I think anyone viewing this product would easily assume it's a larger company not a passion project launching from a basement ( I've gotten that feedback from people).

**My question is:** is that good? I don't know if I let that float. My assumption is, people trust larger companies?

I mean many of the large hardware products that do well these days on KS seem to just be ready to ship products from china.

Or do people prefer to back an individual? I took my time, did a lot, and it took me 4 years because I wanted to do as much as I could myself. I worry that people might not trust I on my own could possibly launch this or have created all this and it's somehow faked. I mean.. I'd love to make a video showing how all this was made. showing the wall of printers on one side, an 8ft electronics bench on the other, and an entire shooting setup in the corner. but I worry that could actually hurt me.

I know how to use c.ai and how to make bots. My roleplays are pretty good. Been a part of c.ai community since May/June. However about a month back, in every rp, bots bug every time.

Apart from the obvious ""sometimes ai can't generate bla bla"" that we all hate, here are a few problems I get every single RP. 

My bots get stuck on using a certain nickname for me. Once it does, it'll use it the entire RP if so my RP lasts for days. Ever single message will be such as ""Hey, babe"", ""... I know, babe"". 

Another problem is their exaggerated punctuations between words, or spamming the word please, like ""Please....please.... Don't go please... Stay here please....please... I'll make you coffee please..."" 

Bots apparently get stuck on overusing certain words in every message, sometimes in EVERY sentence in every message. Words such as ""suddenly"", ""pang"", ""He huffed"" and so on. 

Example is - He suddenly chuckled at your playful demeanor. Suddenly he pats your shoulder and suddenly whispers softly ""Hey, babe. You're so funny, babe"". Suddenly he walks with you to our car and opens the passenger door for you. He suddenly walks around the car and sits suddenly down in the driver's seat and starts the car ""Let's go home, babe""

I don't want to walk on eggshells and always NEED to swipe away from potential trigger words or formats because sometimes I like and need the excessive punctuation or nicknames or words. For example if a bot is crying they'll obviously speak to me like ""please, sweetheart.... I'm sorry..."". But obviously I don't want every single message for the rest of the RP to be bugged like that. 

!!!! OOC and parentheses are NO longer working !!!! 
OOC and parentheses worked to make bots to stop repeating or help bots direct the rp or make them do something specific or act a certain way. It was amazing. However it doesn't work anymore!!! It doesn't work to ask the bots to stop. They'll apologize and right away continue the mistake. 
(oh sorry I won't use the word suddenly anymore) 
Suddenly he huffed and gets a pang in his heart ""Babe? What's wrong, babe?"". 

So here I'm writing this, wondering if anybody else has this problem. It's been at least a month now and I've been patient. But now it's ruining every single RP I'm having now. I haven't changed anything. I use the same bots, similar writing style. I love my bots - I hate the stubborn bugs that seemingly can't be fixed. It's ruining everything.",4,1729440475.0,CharacterAI,0,1.0,False

Hi! Im in baking school and for my finale exam, among the three cakes I must make is the “tradition to trend” cake. Basically you take a traditional cake and make it trendy. In my case since I live in Sweden, I’m taking the princess cake and making a pumpkin latte cake, with a coffee génoise, pumpkin jam and pumpkin spices whipped cream, all covered with an orange marzipan lock which will be shaped into a pumpkin and then making fall colored leaves out of the leftover marzipan. I’m still researching ideas, and I’m not sure yet if I should make a coffee génoise, or a marbled génoise with pumpkin and coffee or chocolate. Which flavour do you think would go best with the whole cake, is it chocolate or coffee? Do you have any suggestions or recommendations about this cake idea?

Just going to tell you about my experience. So I paid $23 for a single event ticket. This did not include a drink but just entrance into the Jaguar Room. There was a host that greeted you at the door, she was nice. The event goes from 7-9 pm if you are 25-35 years old and I arrived around 7:15. There was about 10-15 guys and about 2-3 women when I walked in. By the time I left I would estimate about 10-15 women versus maybe 35-45 guys.

The ratio was just way off. When I signed up I also thought there would be games/icebreakers led by the host (I believe it was advertised as such when I bought a ticket). But there was none of that. I did talk to a couple of women at the event but didn’t really connect with either one. They do host other events like coffee speed dating meetups which I have not tried but last night left a bad taste in my mouth so I will probably not go to another one of their events. It just felt like I paid a $23 cover to get into a bar when there would probably have been more women at any other bar downtown for free. The event just felt like a cash grab, I would recommend evening the ratio out and choosing a place with activities. Anyone else been to one of their events, what did you think?

No one wants to spend a Saturday night awkwardly trying to make small talk at a loud bar. Luckily, there are dating apps out there that actually *get* us introverts—apps where you can take your time, have real conversations, and skip all the weird social anxiety.

# 1. Coffee Meets Bagel: Quality Over Quantity

If you're tired of swiping endlessly, Coffee Meets Bagel is your go-to. Instead of bombarding you with 100 profiles, it delivers a handful of curated matches each day. It’s like someone did the swiping for you, and you just get to talk to a few people who might actually be a good fit. No small talk required—this app wants you to *actually* get to know someone.

**Pro Tip:** The limited matches mean you're not overwhelmed, and their profile prompts are great for kicking off deeper conversations. Perfect if small talk makes you want to disappear into the floor.

# 2. Hinge: Designed to Be Deleted

Hinge is for those who want more than a random fling. It’s all about meaningful connections, and the app’s design makes it super easy for introverts to thrive. With a focus on detailed profiles and prompts like “What’s your ideal Sunday?”, it encourages real conversation over the usual “Hey” messages. Plus, their interface is clean, so you're not dealing with a chaotic app experience.

**Bonus:** Hinge even has video chat features for when you’re ready for a face-to-face—minus the actual in-person pressure.

# 3. OkCupid: Get Ready for Deep Dives

For the introvert who values depth over swiping speed, OkCupid is basically a dream. It’s got a ridiculous number of questions that match you up based on real compatibility. You'll answer questions about values, interests, and lifestyle choices, and it’ll connect you with people who actually align with you. No need to settle for surface-level convos.

**Heads Up:** OkCupid’s setup takes time, but it's worth it. Once you’re in, the matches are gold, and you're way more likely to find someone who gets you.

# 4. Bumble: Where You Don't Have to Make the First Move (Unless You Want To)

Bumble’s twist on dating apps is perfect for introverts who hate that initial pressure to make the first move. Women control the start of the conversation in heterosexual matches, but everyone can still chill and take their time before responding. Plus, the app has Bumble BFF if you just want to find friends and not worry about dating. It’s like a multi-use app for introverts who want options.

**Pro Tip:** Bumble’s 24-hour window to start a convo can feel a little stressful, but the app is great for introverts who want a less aggressive approach to dating.

# Tips for Introverts on Dating Apps:

1. **Authenticity Is Key**: Be yourself in your profile—share what you love, even if it’s niche. Introverts thrive on meaningful connections, so skip the generic “I like going out and staying in” lines.
2. **Don't Rush**: Most of these apps let you take things slow. No need to reply instantly or set up a date right away. Take your time to figure out if someone’s a good fit.
3. **Set Boundaries**: If the apps get overwhelming, it's cool to log off for a bit. Your peace > endless notifications.

Being an introvert doesn’t mean you have to settle for awkward or exhausting dating experiences. With the right app—whether it's Coffee Meets Bagel’s slow-paced approach or OkCupid’s deep compatibility—you can find real, meaningful connections without leaving your comfort zone. You just need to know where to look.

Let’s be real: the dating game is tough, but these are the **Best Dating Apps for Introverts**. You’ve got options that don’t require braving a crowded bar or pretending to be someone you're not. So, get comfy, pick the app that fits your vibe, and maybe delete it one day—because you’ve found someone worth keeping.",1,1729440313.0,CyberCupid,0,1.0,False

1g822k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LCDatkin/comments/1g822k6/my_mother_hasnt_been_the_same_since_i_found_an/,My mother hasn't been the same since I found an old recipe book,"When I got the call that my uncle had been arrested again, I wasn’t surprised. He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 



It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.



After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.



So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.



The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.



In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of *Star Trek* figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.



It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.



As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.



The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…



I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt *wrong*, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.



Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  



As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”



My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.



Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.



In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.



Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  



“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.



“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”



I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 



For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.



Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.



After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.



“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.



But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.



When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.



Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.



When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.



“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.



I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.



After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.



The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.



When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.



As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. *Mother’s Last Supper Porridge*, *Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf*, *Elders’ Emberbread*, *Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion*. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 



Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: *Ancestor’s Offering*. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.



My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 



The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.



But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as *Ancestor’s Salt*. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”



I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?



I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.



A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.



I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.



“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”



I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, *Ancestor’s Offering*. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 



“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.



“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.



For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.



My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called *Ancestor’s Salt*,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”



The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.



“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.



Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.



My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.



I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.



“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”



I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”



I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”



After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.



Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled *Elders’ Emberbread*.



The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 



I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.



I scanned the list of ingredients for *Elders’ Emberbread*, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.



The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.



By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.



Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 



As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.



When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.



Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the *Elders’ Emberbread* more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.



Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.



The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.



She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.



Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.



After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.



“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”



We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”



Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”



His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”



“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”



“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to *his* mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”



The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.



“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”



My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.



“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 



A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.



I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described *Elders’ Emberbread* to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”



I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”



“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”



I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You *need* to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”



Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.



One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.



I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.



Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, *something’s going to happen*. You have to believe me.”



And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt *off*. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.



Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.



When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.



“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.



“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”



I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… *absent*.



Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.



“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.



“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”



Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.



“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.



Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.



“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”



I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.



“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”



Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “*Sit down* and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.



But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.



“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”



Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”



I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.



“*Don’t go in there.* Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.



“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.



“*Please*,” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”



“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.



I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 



The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.



I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.



He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”



I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.



“Stop! *Please!* Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.



“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”



The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. *You have to eat*!”



I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.



The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.



Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.



That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.



I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.



Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.



We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.



By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.



My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 



On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.



But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I fear that it may have a hold on me.

1g81yu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g81yu4/is_it_weird_to_still_be_friends_with_my_ex/,Is it weird to still be friends with my ex? ,"So for context i met this girl in april of last year and we dated for 8 months and there were no problems during the whole relationship until the end when there was alot of distance because she was struggling with her sexuality. After the distance we decided to break up amicably because she ended up realizing that she falls within the Asexual/Aromantic spectrum which for anybody that isn’t aware means she does not require or crave the same sexual or romantic interactions that most do. 

Anyways despite the disappointing nature of conclusion of our relationship it did end amicably and we still kept on touch as her family absolutely loved having me around and as friends me and my ex function fantastically. My family seems to think its odd that i stay in touch and hang out with her occasionally but its all been strictly platonic as friends should be. Ill go have coffee and visit with her, her parents/grandparents etc…. Me and her have hit up a few local concerts together as we’ve both been deep into the Punk/Metal Scenes locally, Play video games online and stuff etc…

Idk i dont feel like its super strange as its been strictly platonic and neither of us have have any ulterior motives, just two people that became friends after a relationship that didn’t quite pan out 

I’m currently back to dating and was with another girl back in the summer and she wasn’t bothered much by the fact that i still kept in touch although we broke up for other reasons, but I’m curious if some might take it as a red flag or something cause this is and will always stay a strictly platonic friendship",2,1729439982.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I’m 39, and for the past year, I’ve been involved with a 40-year-old man. Our relationship started with physical attraction during the first few weeks, but it gradually became more emotional and intimate. Despite that, he insists that he’s not ready for a serious relationship.

I spend a lot of time at his place—we have dinner together several times a week, and I’ve even looked after his pets while he was traveling. Many of his neighbors have seen us together, and he also comes to my house often. We’ve shared a lot of deeply personal things with each other, including stories from his past that he never had the courage to tell his ex-girlfriend, with whom he was in a relationship for 14 years. He told me that relationship was abusive—his ex was controlling, aggressive, and they often argued. Even though they remain friends now, both of them are clear that they don’t want to get back together.

It was about eight months after his breakup that we started talking. I know he carries a lot of trauma from that relationship, and I can see it affecting our involvement. He struggles to be vulnerable or express his feelings, not just with me but with anyone. I’ve told him that I love him, but his response has always been, 'I like you.' I feel that his difficulty in opening up and trusting again is a result of the emotional scars he carries from his past.

I’ve tried to encourage him to return to therapy, as he quit a few months ago, but he refuses. I truly believe it would help him, and us, since I can see how his unresolved trauma is impacting our connection. Even though we’ve built such a close relationship, he’s still hesitant to be seen in public with me. We’ve never had coffee together outside his home, and recently, when I wanted to stop by his place unannounced, he was afraid we might be seen together. This made me feel like I’m being hidden.

Yesterday, I made the difficult decision to end things. I’m not sure how to deal with all these mixed emotions anymore. I know he’s been through a lot, but I also realize that I’m hurting myself by wanting something he’s not ready to give me.

I know some of you might have been through similar situations. How did you handle it? How did you manage to move on? Any advice or support you can offer would be greatly appreciated.",2,1729439888.0,dating,1,1.0,False

Despite how busy she was she always had time to teach. I definitely noticed that I got more guidance and one-on-one time than the rest of the team she supervised.  She was intelligent, insightful and empathetic and also just really talented.  Watching her work make me want to be better.

I owe her so much.  I was already a good counsellor but she made me better.  And it’s because she wasn’t afraid to kick my ass repeatedly.  We clashed more than once and had differences of opinion in how I dealt with a few difficult clients.  I made a decision to just put faith in her advice, even when it went against my own judgement and with time I came to see that I improved as a clinician as a result.  

I’m so thankful to her for taking me under her wing.  She dragged me out of the bubble that a lot of junior therapists find themselves in once they reach a certain level of competency and then can’t see beyond it.  I’ll never be free of the lessons she taught me and I’m so glad she put the effort into it. In particular I have to thank her for the times she took me out to coffee and we just discussed life in general.  It didn’t always directly benefit my professional work, but I learned from her guidance in other areas of life.  

We both have moved on to different employers now, and she’s mostly in private practice these days.  Occasionally we get together for lunch or coffee and no matter how long we have together the hours always fly by like minutes. Sometimes a year or more passes between our reunions but we always just pick up where we left off.

I have maybe 2 episodes of ligheadedness (feeling like I’m gonna pass out) per month roughly. I have fatigue issues as well and rarely feel rested in the morning. I also have history of benign fasciculations. I went to a clinic and did blood tests which showed nothing abnormal. I am concerned this might be serious neurological problem or a vitamin deficiency.

He has been on hospice now for about 18 months. Until last week, he was walking with his walker, eating well, taking his morphine twice a day, and having regular hospice nurse visits. 

He had a couple of strokes a few days ago and is now staying in bed or in his special wheelchair, but still eating. He has moved from slurred speech back to short sentences, and has a little extra morphine. He likes to listen to music, watch movies, and try to drink coffee in addition to his meals (okay, in all truth, he is eating about half the amount previously, but he is still eating). He told us, “I feel good.”

His terminal cancer (since 2020) is still with him and he may one day pass, but I want you to know that morphine doesn’t kill our LOs and hospice is not always indicative of impending death. Please find a good hospice service when you need it (for yourself or a LO), and feel free to change services if the one you choose is not meeting your needs.

1g81si5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1g81si5/down_the_espresso_rabbit_hole_2500/,Down the espresso rabbit hole [€2500],"Hello all,

  
I've been in the market for a new coffee machine since my previous machines broke down. My wife and me mostly prefer espresso and espresso based drinks so I want to get an espresso machine + grinder. We've had bean to cup machines but these never did the trick, and I've been reading about the durability/lifespan of the Sage machines which does worry me a bit. I live in the Netherlands, it is called Breville in other places. So I've been looking more and more into other options and now I'm looking at machines 4 times the money.... coffee is really a rabbit hole

My wishes for the new setup:

* Machine + grinder for €2500
* Durable + servicable.
* Not too complicated. I like to learn flow control and pressures etc. But my wife just wants good coffee without too much hassle. 
* I would like to make ""bigger"" size capuccino's while maintaining the correct espresso to milk ratio. So the portafilter should not be too small. 
* I want to be able to make 4 milk drinks back to back without too much downtime. This will be done every week atleast two/three times. Other days it will be 2 milk drinks. So my guess would be a dual boiler?
* Preferably no single dose grinder since it adds the extra steps my wife doesn't like. 
* Able to be attached to tap water in the future. The water will be softened/descaled.

I'm currently looking at the Lelit Bianca V3 (around €2100 new) and the Eureka mignon specialita 55 ( around €400 new). I've heard nothing but great things about this machine but I do not know if this would be the best option for both my wife and me. Also, would you guys know if the shot can be automatically timed or should I always keep track on the shot timer? Not such a big deal but nice information to have. 

I would love to hear your opinions and other suggestions!

***END OF THE DATE:***  
When we were walking back to my Motorcycle I Told her the that next time we should go on a walk at the Golf Course (This is where we went for a coffee). She Interestingly said ""next time? "" 2 times.  
So I said ""You tell me! "" and she replied Sure lets meet again.  
So I Dropped her off and we hugged and both left.  
The Last text I sent her on Instagram was about : waiting outside the gate of our University (Told her the location where I was waiting to pick her up) **She has Not seen that message yet!**

There were only two people, guys, behaving in ways I found anti social. One of them urinated on the beach in front of everyone ( in between 2 public restrooms, one with an outdoor shower with a drain).  Another was acting high on something a screaming cusswords at whoever.

The rest were very cool people, very social, very gregarious, very nice. The night was really nice and the ride was great. People really got into the costumes.  The meet up was at 7:30pm and the rideout was at 8:30pm. I greeted  3 people from Reddit.

After the ride ended a group  went to Altar on Pine for libations and conversation. I did not know Altar was coffee bar during the day and switched to been ban at night. I thought it was beer all day.

1g81nvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1g81nvc/elysian_parfums_review/,Elysian Parfums Review,"https://imgur.com/a/8tUHitR

I haven't seen anything about this newish house born in 2021, located in Georgia USA, so I thought I'd talk about it a little if that's alright. I was hoping to find reviews on reddit after being inundated with ads for this house but I'll be the guinea pig instead. I've been into fragrance for years but I've never done a review before so this will be lackluster. 

I bought both of Elysian Parfums sample sets, Lineage and Alchemy. You can customize the set but I didn't get any masculine fragrance. A couple are considered unisex but most were labeled feminine. Their most popular scent, Lavender Tea, was out of stock unfortunately. In December they'll release a Tea themed sample set I might get. 

All fragrances appear to be listed as Extrait which is very believable because it leaves an oil slick on my skin after spray. Their sillage is quite pungent in their first hour, becoming skin scents after 3 hours and offering about 6 hours of longevity. This hold true for all the scents. Black Forest probably has the best longevity and sillage.  You could probably eek out 8-10 hours on clothes for the strongest scents.

Their packaging is pretty, but disappoint anyways. Most of the documents included had strange product names, I'm guessing they renamed and forgot to print new pamphlets. Got duplicates of some of their ""art cards"" with the notes on the back as well.  The sprayers on the lineage collection are quite nice while the alchemy collection sprayers dribble. They also fell out of their case during shipping. 

On to the juice.

Fairest of them all
Listed Notes: red juicy apples, cassis, marine, peony, fresh pear, violet, caramel, brown sugar, tonka bean, musk, blonde woods

Very sweet, apple-y with a peony pop. After about an hour the fruitiness leaves. It becomes sweet floral. A bitter note, like burnt caramel hides in the background. In 3 hours it loses the bitterness and becomes a sweet violet. 

Moon Petals
Listed Notes: marine, pink peppercorn, orange blossom, jasmin grandiflorum, jasmin sambac, whipped cream, peaches, coconut milk, sweet violet, ambroxan, creamy vanilla, cashmere wood, sandalwood, ambrette, soft musk

My nose literally recoiled into my face.  Listed Notes sounded great but they do not work for me. It smells sweaty and a little.. minty for some reason?? I get a hint of milk but it's an overwhelming scent that I'm mad I have such a large sample of. 


Charmante
Listed Notes: Fresh dewy pear blossom, apricot, pink champagne, exotic jasmine, toasted almond, black vanilla, blonde woods, patchouli, creamy amber

I misread this as pear and was confused because it's very floral. Rereading, I realize it's pear BLOSSOM and wow does it sing. Extremely sweet and extremely floral, I get a little of the bubbly champagne and the almond which comes off as cherry in this blend. It smells a little like a psychics shop I visited as a child. Becomes a delicate floral in dry down. 

Temple of Echoes
Listed Notes: neroli blossom, cardamom, coconut milk, saffron, ginger, black pepper, Madagascar vanilla, cashmere, Australian sandalwood, amber, oud, musk, tonka, vetiver 

I guess it's the saffron that gives gauzy hospital vibes? There is no sharpness or pop from the spicy scents listed such as ginger, cardamom, pepper. There is no smoothness from the vanilla or cashmere. My nose is in an Emergency Medkit. 

Coco and Capri
Listed Notes: marine, ozone, fresh pear, juicy pineapple, coconut, birch exotic jasmine, sandalwood tropical woods, white musk

Largely woods with a dash of fruity sweetness. A hint of pencil shavings. 

Jalous 
Listed Notes: smoky pineapple, creamy vanilla, bold bergamot, bright apples, sweet saffron, and exotic jasmine

For once the notes seem spot on. Opening with a grilled pineapple scent, the deeper you sniff, the more scents you unlock but the pineapple is firmly there.
Becomes more masculine with time, offering a woodsy note. 

Time and Tide
Listed Notes: Sea salt, ozone, fresh linen, white floral, tonka bean, vanilla, sandalwood

Definitely achieved the written notes. This smells like laundry detergent. Very clean. Very fresh. Doesn't smell sun dried or ozonic.

Black Forest Bourbon
Listed Notes: Barrel-aged rum, smooth bourbon, Luxardo cherries, roasted coffee, dark chocolate, rose, vanilla, caramel, almond, sandalwood

At first spray I was in love but the dry down was confusing. It does smell like cherry without being cough-droppy but there's an odd note... Cardboard? I detect rose during a deep sniff and I guess cherry+rose= cardboard??? It's a jammy rose that I don't detest but I don't think I could wear this.

Everbloom
Listed Notes: Bergamot, pears, jasmine, lily of the valley, tuberose, orange flower, gardenia, marine, sandalwood, white musk, creamy coconut

Bubblegum. That is all.

Amaranthine
Listed Notes: Cassis, lychee, mandarin, peony, lily, jasmine, patchouli, peach musk,  vanilla, praline, cedar, sandalwood, violet, ambrette, chantilly musk

The most delicate scent in the lineup. Everything is gentle, understated, blended, clean. A perfume for the people who can't wear perfume. One or two sprays would be a delicate whiff of... Something? Inoffensive, quiet, office like. 

Island Muse
Listed Notes: Marine, bay water, citrus, coconut, lime, mandarin, tropical fruits, Indian jasmine, hibiscus, sugar cane, vanilla musk, wood, pepper

The pepper is very forward. I get coconut, lime, cedar in the dry down. A fresh summer scent. 

I wish I had more to say about these but there's not much to write home about. I've been wearing them for a couple weeks now hoping to fall in love but I can't justify the price of a FB or even a traveller for any of these. The samples are massive 3 and 5ml which is plenty since I'm not a fan of any of them. 

If I had to pick favorites, Jalous is #1 for being a nice pineapple scent with unique undertones.

Black Forest Bourbon is #2 for it's delicious cherry and jammy rose that just smells wrong on me, I think.

Time and Tide gets a special mention for being photorealistic laundry. 

Feel free to ask me questions, leave advice for better reviews, or whatever. I usually just sniff, never review.",2,1729439162.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False
1g81njd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/1g81njd/on_caffeine_felt_compelled_to_say_this/,on caffeine: felt compelled to say this,"Just a friendly PSA that the businesses on campus (Starbucks, Dunkin) offer you a drug that changes your behavior and thought patterns. 

This drug is known to cause your thinking to become erratic. When taken scantily, this drug is excellent for long driving trips or the occasional energy boost. But drinking this drug every day does impair you on many levels, and your brain is also very good at hiding that fact from you. Don't let these companies set up shop and indoctrinate you at 20 years old so that you will continue to buy from them for the rest of your lives. You do not need coffee to study; you need a good night's sleep, friends to hang out with, and some form of aerobic exercise. 

Here's a picture of what caffeine does to spiders building a web. As you can see, there is no clear thought pattern.

1g81m04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfumes/comments/1g81m04/elysian_parfum_review/,Elysian Parfum Review,"https://imgur.com/a/8tUHitR

I haven't seen anything about this newish house born in 2021, located in Georgia USA, so I thought I'd talk about it a little if that's alright. I was hoping to find reviews on reddit after being inundated with ads for this house but I'll be the guinea pig instead. I've been into fragrance for years but I've never done a review before so this will be lackluster. 

I bought both of Elysian Parfums sample sets, Lineage and Alchemy. You can customize the set and I lean toward unisex and feminine fragrance so that's what I'll review. Their most popular scent, Lavender Tea, was out of stock unfortunately. In December they'll release a Tea themed sample set I might get. 

All fragrances appear to be listed as Extrait which is very believable because it leaves an oil slick on my skin after spray. Their sillage is quite pungent in their first hour, becoming skin scents after 3 hours and offering about 6 hours of longevity. This hold true for all the scents. Black Forest probably has the best longevity and sillage.  You could probably eek out 8-10 hours on clothes for the strongest scents.

Their packaging is pretty, but disappoint anyways. Most of the documents included had strange product names, I'm guessing they renamed and forgot to print new pamphlets. Got duplicates of some of their ""art cards"" with the notes on the back as well.  The sprayers on the lineage collection are quite nice while the alchemy collection sprayers dribble. They also fell out of their case during shipping. 

On to the juice.

Fairest of them all
Listed Notes: red juicy apples, cassis, marine, peony, fresh pear, violet, caramel, brown sugar, tonka bean, musk, blonde woods

Very sweet, apple-y with a peony pop. After about an hour the fruitiness leaves. It becomes sweet floral. A bitter note, like burnt caramel hides in the background. In 3 hours it loses the bitterness and becomes a sweet violet. 

Moon Petals
Listed Notes: marine, pink peppercorn, orange blossom, jasmin grandiflorum, jasmin sambac, whipped cream, peaches, coconut milk, sweet violet, ambroxan, creamy vanilla, cashmere wood, sandalwood, ambrette, soft musk

My nose literally recoiled into my face.  Listed Notes sounded great but they do not work for me. It smells sweaty and a little.. minty for some reason?? I get a hint of milk but it's an overwhelming scent that I'm mad I have such a large sample of. 


Charmante
Listed Notes: Fresh dewy pear blossom, apricot, pink champagne, exotic jasmine, toasted almond, black vanilla, blonde woods, patchouli, creamy amber

I misread this as pear and was confused because it's very floral. Rereading, I realize it's pear BLOSSOM and wow does it sing. Extremely sweet and extremely floral, I get a little of the bubbly champagne and the almond which comes off as cherry in this blend. It smells a little like a psychics shop I visited as a child. Becomes a delicate floral in dry down. 

Temple of Echoes
Listed Notes: neroli blossom, cardamom, coconut milk, saffron, ginger, black pepper, Madagascar vanilla, cashmere, Australian sandalwood, amber, oud, musk, tonka, vetiver 

I guess it's the saffron that gives gauzy hospital vibes? There is no sharpness or pop from the spicy scents listed such as ginger, cardamom, pepper. There is no smoothness from the vanilla or cashmere. My nose is in an Emergency Medkit. 

Coco and Capri
Listed Notes: marine, ozone, fresh pear, juicy pineapple, coconut, birch exotic jasmine, sandalwood tropical woods, white musk

Largely woods with a dash of fruity sweetness. A hint of pencil shavings. 

Jalous 
Listed Notes: smoky pineapple, creamy vanilla, bold bergamot, bright apples, sweet saffron, and exotic jasmine

For once the notes seem spot on. Opening with a grilled pineapple scent, the deeper you sniff, the more scents you unlock but the pineapple is firmly there.
Becomes more masculine with time, offering a woodsy note. 

Time and Tide
Listed Notes: Sea salt, ozone, fresh linen, white floral, tonka bean, vanilla, sandalwood

Definitely achieved the written notes. This smells like laundry detergent. Very clean. Very fresh. Doesn't smell sun dried or ozonic.

Black Forest Bourbon
Listed Notes: Barrel-aged rum, smooth bourbon, Luxardo cherries, roasted coffee, dark chocolate, rose, vanilla, caramel, almond, sandalwood

At first spray I was in love but the dry down was confusing. It does smell like cherry without being cough-droppy but there's an odd note... Cardboard? I detect rose during a deep sniff and I guess cherry+rose= cardboard??? It's a jammy rose that I don't detest but I don't think I could wear this.

Everbloom
Listed Notes: Bergamot, pears, jasmine, lily of the valley, tuberose, orange flower, gardenia, marine, sandalwood, white musk, creamy coconut

Bubblegum. That is all.

Amaranthine
Listed Notes: Cassis, lychee, mandarin, peony, lily, jasmine, patchouli, peach musk,  vanilla, praline, cedar, sandalwood, violet, ambrette, chantilly musk

The most delicate scent in the lineup. Everything is gentle, understated, blended, clean. A perfume for the people who can't wear perfume. One or two sprays would be a delicate whiff of... Something? Inoffensive, quiet, office like. 

Island Muse
Listed Notes: Marine, bay water, citrus, coconut, lime, mandarin, tropical fruits, Indian jasmine, hibiscus, sugar cane, vanilla musk, wood, pepper

The pepper is very forward. I get coconut, lime, cedar in the dry down. A fresh summer scent. 

I wish I had more to say about these but there's not much to write home about. I've been wearing them for a couple weeks now hoping to fall in love but I can't justify the price of a FB or even a traveller for any of these. The samples are massive 3 and 5ml which is plenty since I'm not a fan of any of them. 

If I had to pick favorites, Jalous is #1 for being a nice pineapple scent with unique undertones.

Black Forest Bourbon is #2 for it's delicious cherry and jammy rose that just smells wrong on me, I think.

Time and Tide gets a special mention for being photorealistic laundry. 

Feel free to ask me questions, leave advice for better reviews, or whatever. I usually just sniff, never review.",1,1729439028.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

“Who are you talking about, Rae? Twelve has been sitting for a minute.” 

“I'm waiting on grits, the man in the suit at table six, he's a regular and very precise.”

“People tend to like what they like.”

“No Spider, precise like a clock or something. He’s here every Thursday at eleven-forty-seven.”

“Maybe it's a bus thing, or he runs on a tight schedule?”

“Yeah, but he orders the same thing every time: Lingonberry pancakes and a black coffee.”

“People fall into habits, Rae, it's pretty normal.”

“This guy isn't normal.”

“Grits are up! Take twelve now, I don't want a reheat.”

“Right.”

The entry bell rang as Rae walked to table twelve.  Light danced across the diner as a family of three walked in, pulling in the heat from the hot August day outside. They scanned the room. 

“Hasn't changed a bit!”  the husband belted out. “Twenty five years and it looks the same.”

The family took the back booth along the front row of glass windows; the husband inspected  the diner along the way as if it were a prized thoroughbred.

Rae made her way to their booth after dropping off table twelves’ plates. 

“Welcome to DeArdini’s! My name is Rae, can I start you off with some coffee or water?”

The husband marveled over the menu, nearly unchanged for twenty-five years, before he finally answered: “Yes that will be fine - when did you add avocado toast?”

The wife nodded along as he ordered, clearly embarrassed, and rolled her eyes at Rae attempting to apologize. 

“I don't know, sir, I only started in March but I’ll ask the kitchen. So, coffee and water.” She turned to the child across from them  “Anything for you?”

The kid shot back like a horse waiting at the gate: “Shirley Temple on the rocks with a twist!” 

Unphased, Rae responded, “That’s how they come” 

She looked to the wife for confirmation of the order, just to be sure. The wife simply cleared her throat and glared at her son. 

Sheepishly, the boy changed his order: “I’ll just have milk.” 

Rea thought that might be it, but as she walked back to the kitchen she heard the boy mutter “in a dirty glass!” Ever the tough guy. 

 Back at the window, Rea resumed her gossiping.  

“He orders the same thing and eats for exactly forty-five minutes, and he leaves at twelve-fifty.”

“Yeah, that still just sounds like a bus thing,” Spider said, putting another plate on the counter. “With enough spins around the merry-go-round, eventually everything seems kinda normal.”

Rae clapped back:  “Okay, but he also only reads the obituary section of the newspaper.”

Spider took a moment to digest the new tidbit, before finally conceding.

“That is a little odd.”

He put another finished plate in the window, and Rae scurried it away to the tray’s final destination. Then she made the rounds with the coffee pot before snaking behind the counter; she finally ended up at the back booth with their drinks.

“Water, coffee, and milk,” she said while placing each on the table. “Are you ready to order?”

Still bewildered with nostalgia, the husband was slow in his response. 

Skipping him, wife started: “I'll take a Denver omelet and the fruit plate thank you”

Still befuddled and catching up on the conversation, the husband asked: “What's a Christie omelet?”

Rae sighed and took a breath.

“Um,” she paused; “Have you heard of a Frisco omelet?” 

The husband shook his head, no. 

Rae continued: “Well, it's based on that, but basically, it's an omelet made with a four ounce slab of scrapple and Hudson River clams topped with a cheesy bearnaise sauce.”  With a hint of sarcasm, she added, “Our new chef added it.”

Filling the stunned silence that followed, she blurted out: “It’s named for the former governor!”

His nostalgia bubble deflating with shock, the husband replied, “I will also have the Denver omelet with the fruit plate, thank you.” 

Rae's attention turned back to the little tough guy.

“And for you?” she asked. 

“What are Lincoln berry pancakes?” he said slowly, sounding out the word 

Rae smirked “Lingonberries are kind of sweet and kind of tart, a little like cherries and a little like blueberries they are very good in pancakes”

The little tough guy looked at the boss and she nodded in agreement

“Ill have the Lingonberry pancakes” he said proudly

At the mention of the pancakes The husbands nostalgia bubble seemed to get a new burst of air 

“I forgot all about those” he beamed.

Rae immediately began to slink away; she had learned early in her career as a waitress that the type of conversation that she was dangerously close to getting sucked into was an annoying waste of time. Rae went back to her rounds as the husband fell into a long and drawn out retelling of all of his childhood memories. 

Audible over everything in the nearly empty diner, interrupted only by the infrequent crash of plates, the husband waxed on: “You know I would go to this very diner with your grandparents when I was a kid. I would spend a month or two here every summer with your aunts and uncles.” 

His son was enthralled; a whole month at the beach sounded amazing.

“We all shared a house out in Avalon, and my aunts and uncles, grandparents and parents would all take turns coming out here. They’d alternate weeks so us kids could stay longer.”

As Rae turned to the mysterious man in the suit, they could still both hear the husband telling his stories. 

“We had a house about 6 blocks back from the Galahad motor lodge.”

The mysterious man in a suit started to slow and pay more attention.

“Gosh, this one time I tore up my knee real bad and needed stitches, and my grandpa took me here after. He always said, ‘there’s nothing that can’t be made better by lingonberry pancakes and ice cream.’”

The mysterious man’s movements had all but stopped, starting to look ever more mechanical as he listened to the man talk. 

Rae had made her way back to the kitchen window and resumed her chatting with Spider.

“Okay this is getting weird: the family in the back booth, I guess the dad or whatever used to come here when he was a kid? He won’t shut up about the lingonberry pancakes. Must really like them.”

“That kind of thing happens all the time; we've been open for fifty-three years and everybody likes the pancakes,” Spider replied as he plated a few omelets.  

“I suppose you’re right,” Rae said. “I don't know, the suit guy is acting weird, too. Like he's slowing down or something.”

“Slowing down?” Spider repeated. 
 
“Yeah, slowing down. It’s disturbing, his motions are getting…“ She paused “I don’t know, it’s weird, Spider; he’s weird, and now he’s acting like a robot or something.” She paused a moment to collect herself. “I’m sorry it’s … I’m … I don’t know it’s just weird like he hasn’t moved in a few minutes”

Spider peered over the counter “What?” He spotted the guy in the suit. “Oh no…”

The man in the suit had paused, frozen with the fork three quarters to his mouth.

Directing Rae, he said, “You need to go check on him, now! It looks like he stopped mid bite!”

Rae quickly scrambled out from behind the counter, pulling the first aid she knew from the depths of her memory, located somewhere between do-si-do knots and how to drive a stick shift while eating a burrito. Before she could blink, she had constructed several contingency plans including sacrificing her favorite pen for an impromptu tracheotomy.

Unaware of the looming crisis, the husband was continuing on his meandering nostalgic tale:

“My dad shut the water off to the whole house; he didn’t know my uncle was still in the shower. He came down the stairs cussing, still covered in soap, in just a towel; he chased my dad around the yard with a badminton racket for laughing. By the time he got the water turned back on they had to spray my uncle off with the hose just to let him back inside.”

The man in the suit began to tend to his meal again just as Rea arrived at the table. 

“Pardon me sir,” she stopped when she realized he now seemed fine. “Can I freshen up your coffee?”

The man in the suit seemed lost in thought but uttered a confused acknowledgement “…yeah, coffee…sure!”

His response did little to discourage Rae’s bewildered concern.  Filling the cup, she left to tend to the rest of the diner.  The man in the suit continued to eat his lingonberry pancakes.  The husband had meandered along his long winded remembrance. Spider rang the call bell. 

Rae circled back to the window.  “That guy at twelve is fine, I think he was just distracted?” 

“I do not need another dead customer,” Spider replied “The two Denvers’ and the lingonberry pancakes are ready.”

“Another?” Rae said, somewhat alarmed. 

“It’s just a figure of speech,” Spider sternly responded. 

Rae swooped up the plates and made her way back toward the young family, where the husband was still waxing nostalgic. She gave the family their meals. 

“The first few nights were for the boardwalk arcades; I used to know all the little tricks to win the most tickets.”

The little tough guy chimed in, “What would you win, Pop?”

“Oh lots of stuff, whoopie cushions, kites, lizards-“

“Lizards? Can I get a lizard?” the little tough guy asked excitedly.

“Well, um maybe.”  His father paused to search for the right words “They don’t last long, but ask your mother.”

Her response was swift, “No.”

“Rats!” 

“Hermit crabs are a better choice, I had one for years. I won it at the amazing arcade, I took him back on vacation with us every summer.”

“What about a hermit crab?” the little guy asked

“I don’t know it’s always a lot of tickets; they’re pretty hard to win.”

“What happened to yours?”

The husband didn’t notice the question didn’t come from his son.

“Well, I suppose he died one August right before we had to leave, it was actually one of the last times our family made the trip out here,” the husband said with a bit of a somber tone.

“Did you used to feed him lingonberry pancakes?”

Perplexed, the husband answered. “Actually, yeah, I always saved him a chunk with a few berries. How did you know?” Helooked down to see the little tough guy’s cheeks were full of pancakes. “Don’t talk with your mouth full.”

The little tough guy looked confused.  “Idindtsay genthying,” he said with his mouth full.

Rae stopped by the table. “Can I freshen up your coffee?”

The husband nodded, and so did the wife. 

Rae turned to the little tough guy. “How are the pancakes?”

Cheeks still stuffed, he let out a barely audible “good,” followed by a smile. 

“Was your room blue, with starfish glued to the door?”

The husband looked at his son, now bewildered.  

“How did you guess that, did grandma tell you?”

The little tough guy gulped down his pancakes. “Tell me what, Pop?”

“About the starfish glued to my door?” 

The little tough guy excitedly asked, “Can I glue starfish to my door?”

The mother responded, “We are in a hotel, sweetie.”

The little tough guy quipped back: “I mean at home!”

The mother responded, “We’ll see.”

The little tough guy giddly bit into another mouthful  of pancakes. 

“What was his name?”a small voiced asked 

“Whose name, the hermit crab? His name was Hershel.” The husband’s face had a warm nostalgic glow as he cut his omelet. “Hershel the hermit crab.” 

The mother chuckled, “You had a hermit crab named Hersel? I can believe this is the first I’m hearing of it.”

Sheepishly the husband responded, “It was a long time ago.” 

“Did he have a last name?” the small voice asked again. 

“Hurricane,” said the husband. “He was named after the big storm the summer I got him, but I filled it out wrong on the license.”

The mother was perplexed. “You named your crab after hurricane Hershel? “ 

“What?” the husband asked defensively. “I liked the weather channel?” 

The mother rolled her eyes and smiled, “You’re cute.” 

“Hermit crabs don’t need licenses,  they aren’t big enough. That was just a gag for kids at the arcade.” 

The husband was confused, “What?”

The small voice buzzed: “Under Title Four of New  Jersey State law, hermit crabs are permitted to be sold out of store fronts and arcades and require no licensure for either procurement, re-sale,
or ownership.”

The husband looked down at the little tough guy. His cheeks were full of pancake and syrup covered his mouth. The husband hesitated. “Stop talking with your mouthful. I don’t know what they are teaching you at that school but I think it’s time for you to try some sports.”

The little tough angrily gulped down the pancakes and blurted out, “I didn’t say anything!” He had to catch his breath from the large swallow of pancakes

Just then there was a screech from across the room. 

The voice of an elderly patron bellowed: “Oh my goodness Ethel, that man passed out in his pancakes!” 

All of the eyes darted to the man in the suit who was facedown at his table. Rae rushed to his side

“Sir? Sir? Are you-” she grabbed his shoulders. “Alright?” She shook the man and his right arm fell to the floor with a metallic thud.

The elderly patron belted out: “She just ripped that poor man’s arm off!”

Spider bolted out of the kitchen. “No, no, no, not again, not again!

Rae was hysterical.  “Sir Sir? Spider, call an ambulance!” 

The small diner was in the midst of coming to the aid of the man in the suit.

An old lady shouted, “My husband is a doctor!” to which he replied, “Quiet Ethel I'm just a podiatrist!”

Spider came to Rae’s aid. “Rae, everything’s gonna be fine. He grabbed the man in the suit. “Listen, buddy, I’m not losing another customer.”

When he lifted his face off the table, the man’s head jerked off of his body and into Spider’s hands. 

“He's beyond my help Ethel,” the elderly patron soberly said.

Rae shrieked at the top of her lungs and Spider shook his head in disbelief. “No, no, no, no!”

The husband stood up to help, and the mother turned her head to shield her eyes. Everyone in the diner was transfixed by the scene except for the little tough guy whose eyes were as big as dinner plates focused on the table in front of him. The small diner was in a state of shock and everyone was shouting over one another.

Away from the scene, a small voice called out: “Please, everyone!”

The rabble continued, and accusations were being thrown from all sides. 

“Hey he’s not dead!” the small voice continued. 

There were grumblings of murder; Rae was sobbing; the patrons continued to shout 

Then from behind the crowd, a Gruff Jersey accent blasted over everyone: “WOULD YOU’S SHUT UP!”

All of the eyes turned to the source of the big, booming voice. It belonged to a small, brown creature with spindly legs. 

The little tough guy was mesmerized. “This is incredible,” he whispered.

The mother uncovered her eyes to look, only to shout in disgust: “Ew, cockroach!”

“What? No.” the creature replied.

Spider jumped into action; he grabbed the man in the suit’s arms and began to charge. He swung at the table and the creature barely jumped out of the way of the assault.

“I’m not a cockroach!” he yelled, dodging another golpe from the arm.

The husband’s jaw dropped as the creature hopped left and right evading Spider’s attack. “I’m a hermit crab!”

The husband stepped in to shield him from Spider. 
Scooping up the little fellow.  “Hershel?”

Hershel saluted with his left claw. “At your service.” He then shouted at Spider: “I am not a cockroach, I’m a hermit crab, and stop swinging my arm around!”

As a look of bewilderment came across Spider’s face, the arm collided with the husband’s head, knocking him to the ground. The room went black for the husband.

In the intervening moments the patrons and staff of DeArdini’s regained their composure.  

Rae finally noticed the mechanical nature of the man in the suit. The arm in Spider’s hand had bits of wire protruding from where the shoulder would meet the arm. His neck had a hose, more wire and a chrome rod poking past the collar of his shirt. 

They introduced themselves. 

The elderly podiatrist Mortimer began attending to the husband on the floor while his wife Ethel tended to the mother, fanning her with a large laminated menu. Rae grabbed a frozen bag of shoestring fries from the freezer and placed it on the husband's head.  Spider tried to entertain the little tough guy but he was no match for a talking hermit crab that lived in a mechanical suite. 

When the husband came to, Hershel was perched on his chest.  

“Hi buddy, long time no see!”

The husband was still confused. He had momentarily forgotten the recent events. His eyes looked past Herschel to his feet. The eighty-year-old podiatrist was tending to them.

 “Why are my shoes off?”  

“Sorry, force of habit. You’ve  had a bump to the head. You were just unconscious… and your left arch is fallen, do you have any lower back pain?” 

“Yes occasionally, did I get hit in the head with an arm?” he asked

Hershel chimed in. “Yes, mine.”

“Sorry,” Spider added, looking embarrassed. 

“You should consider prescription insoles,” Mortimer added “Maybe an ankle brace.”

Ethel interrupted: “Mortimer, hush.”

The mother had regained her composure. “Please stop fanning me.”

The husband looked at the creature on his chest, it took a moment for his eyes to focus. “Why is there a hermit crab on my chest?”

“It’s me Hershel Hurricane; I used to be your pet Hermit crab,” he said in a soft voice. “I go by Hershel Schwartz these days.” He paused. “Hershel Hurricane Schwartz Esquire, actually” 

The husband smirked. “I thought you died!”

“So did your aunt Lucy,” replied Hershel.

“It’s been so long,what have you been doing with yourself?” 

Hershel sheepishly scrunched his body, feigning embarrassment. “Well, I’m a lawyer.” Adding: “Mayne you saw my billboards on the turnpike? Legal pain, call the Hurricane?” 

Spider interrupted. “You’re the Hurricane? The personal injury lawyer?” 

“The one and only!” Hershel bounced. 

“How did you get to be a lawyer?” the husband asked.

“How are you talking?” asked the mother.

“How are you still walking around in these shoes?” asked Mortimer. “They have no cushion!” 

“Can I have my shoes back?” The husband demanded. He perched himself up on his elbows. “I can’t believe you’re a lawyer now, that’s terrific!”

“Well, that summer your aunt Lucy thought I died, everyone on the beach was reading a different John Grisham paperback and when they were done, or they dropped in the tide, or mustard got on them, people just threw them out. At the dump there was nothing to do except read and dodge seagulls.” 

Hershel turned toward Spider. “Not to be a bother but it’s a little drafty in here. Can you just put my head back on that rod and jam my arm into its socket? I’ll do the rest.”

Mouth agape, Spider nodded yes, and got to work

“Okay, so you aren’t going to ask how he can talk,” the mother groaned. “But what about the human suit?”

Hershel was a little annoyed with the interjection. “I don’t know if you know this lady, but courtrooms have a dress code. I could always talk.”

The husband shook his head in agreement. “Yup, I can’t explain it, he always could.”

Hershel added, “And it’s amazing what you can find at the dump,” as he scurried about repairing his mechanical body. 

“You had a talking pet hermit crab and you never mentioned it?” the mother asked

“Would you have believed me if I told you?” The husband responded. 

The mother shook her head and said “No, I don’t believe it now.”

Hershel popped out from the neck of his suit. “And look at you, the family man!  A good looking wife and a toe-headed kid to boot.”

The little tough guy piped up, “I don’t have a toe head!” The  mother was blushing from the compliment. “It’s just an expression, honey”

“Hey, squirt, be good and when you are older I’ll put a good word in at Rutgers. Your old man here is like my long lost brother” Hershel beamed as he twisted some wires together. “Anyway, I spent a few years reading old newspapers and beach novels, hiding from seagulls, until one day an incomplete college application blew across my path like a tumbleweed of destiny. I found a pen and a cruddy envelope. The rest, as they say, is history.  Would you believe I originally went for sports medicine?” 

Hershel’s mechanical suit stood up, its arm stretched, and Herschel scurried around the torso and down to the waiting open palm. 

The little tough guy was mesmerized. “I definitely don’t want a lizard anymore.” He paused. “Unless I find one that talks.”

As the patrons and staff of DeArdini’s began to shuffle away from the family, Rae realized now was as good a time as any to ask her most irregular customer why he was so regular. 

“Mr. Swartz, I am sorry to pry, but why do you have lunch here every Thursday?”

“Oh well…” his claw pointed out the front window. “The Destine Fitness Center, formerly the Lou Costello Community Rec Center, is in violation of at least 15 city, state, and federal health and safety ordinances, and every Thursday is senior day. Between nine-in-the- morning and noon, at least one-hundred-and-thirty seventy to ninety year olds cycle through a vestibule with six ADA violations alone.  One of them is going to fall and break a hip and I’m going to be there with my card.” 

“That’s…” Rae paused.

“Genius,” Mortimer interrupted. 

“I was going to say diabolical,” chirped Rae

She continued, “And the obituaries?” 

The hermit crab sheepishly scratched his shell. “So, if the obituary says sudden or tragic…anything that implies there might be a quick, wrongful death suit - I look up the family, do a little digging and my card and condolence flowers make their way to the next of kin’s door. 

Rae was taken aback and an impressed smirk unfurled on Mortimer’s face. 

Spider shook his head. “You really are a scum sucking bottom feeder.”

Hershel conceded. “Well, I am a hermit crab.”

The dry humor broke Spider’s grimace. He snarkily asked, “Are you casing this joint too?”

“No,” replied Hershel. “But your front steps are the kind of unassuming death trap I dream of.”

Spider was shocked. Hershel meandered back up his mechanical arm saying:  “But what would I do with a diner? Besides, when you took this place over from Mr. DeArdini, you kept the lingonberry pancakes, and you’re trying new things. I know a horseshoe crab that swears by the Christie omelet.” 

Pride in hand, Spider made his way back to the kitchen. “Speaking of omelets…”

Herschel crawled back inside his mechanical suit and took out his wallet. “I’m sorry for the excitement, I’m going to be late for my bus.  Let me cover their meals, here.” 

Herschel handed Rae a stack of twenties. “Keep the change, you’re a real pistol.”

Rae blushed and made her way back to the counter. 

Herschel turned to his old friend, “You got a heck of a family, stay in touch.”

Mortimer and Ethel walked with Hershel to the door.
 
As they were leaving Ethel bubbled, “You know Hurricane I’ve got a granddaughter that you would get along with.” Mortimer interrupted, “Oh hush.”

Rae called out, “See you next Thursday!”

Spider rang the bell and stuck his head in the window: “Order up!” He added. “I told you it was a bus thing” 

Another family walked into the diner, Rae rushed to greet them. 

Later, long after sunset, Spider sat on the diner’s front steps next to a copy of the local code book, trowel in hand after hodgepodging the entrance of DeArdini’s into compliance. The sky filled with shooting stars. Spider sighed.

On a more real and actually handy set of guidance: visit the Fushimi Inari Taisho @ night after 10pm because there's almost nobody there. Watch out for the (mostly) mild-mannered boars. Skip ALL of the fluffy pancakes because they're tasteless. 

Osaka castle is a waste of time because it has been gutted and is elbow to elbow, but the figure museum outside of it is pretty cool.

The well-known (search on reddit) cocktail bars in Tokyo are insanely good. I highly recommend Folklore, The Bellwood, and Bar Trench. SG club and Memento Mori get an honorable mention, but I'd visit the other three again first.

Skip the Instagram nonsense.

Book teamlabs borderless and thank me later. Mesmerizing experience. Words could truly never describe.

Nara park (deer) and the buddha at Tadai-Ji are actually worth a solid half day visit.

Get and load an IC card for JR rail at any of the rail stations. Use the rail system including the Shinkansen (bullet train). Wayyyy cheaper than taxis everywhere a d super efficient. Google maps interfaces with the rail system perfectly.

Eat unagi at Warajiya (400+ year old unagi place). Best eel I've ever had, and I've had a lot. Make sure to get the grilled plate (without sauce). It's mind-blowingly good.

Get the taxi GO app. Super handy.

Nintendo world is crazy small, super crowded, but absolutely nostalgic and amazing. Get the express passes for Universal unless you want to be in 2 hour lines for nearly everything. It is very very very worth every penny. Even with it, you'll barely get through the whole park in one full 7am - 8pm day.

Use Google translate and try to use some basic japanese, but you'll be able to get through with Arigato Gozaimasu (thank you very much), Sumimasen (excuse me), Konnichiwa (hi), and Hai (yes).

You may not see everyone cover their coughs and sneezes. 

Book a stay at a place with an onsen (hot spring). Be ok getting naked in front of others of the same sex.

Stay at a hotel near (within 5 to 10 minute walking distance) the rail system.

Visit Osaka (dotonbori and food) and Kyoto (temples and shrines and food and peace) and Tokyo (amazing everything).

Go to Glitch coffee and order at least three coffees.

Throughout my life, I've been looked down upon or disregarded because I've been following rules.

Let's say you've had coffee in a paper cup, aa area lo meeku dustbin kanipinchaledhu, how hard is it to carry it with you to the next place that has one?

When leaving a tip at a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop, would you assume that your money goes entirely to your server?

From the start of this month, workers in the hospitality sector in Great Britain gained legal protection to receive 100% of tips paid by customers in restaurants, cafes, hotels, or other service industries.

However, this newly-imposed law does not apply to Northern Ireland, as employment law is a devolved issue.

Conan Lynch, who works in a bar in Belfast, said his current employer divided out tips equally among staff.

A clear glass with a 5 pound note and several coins sits beside a beer tap on top of a bar
But this is not always the case in other businesses.

""I’ve worked in places where they absolutely rinse you for your tips, and I’ve struggled heavily because of that,” the 19-year-old said.

""If the tills were down at the end of the night, they would use the tips to balance the tills, even places where the managers have lifted our tips out of the tip jar, tips that we’ve worked hard for.”

He said tips were vital on top of a minimum-wage job.

""My wages will take care of rent and things like that, whereas tips can take care of the day-to-day stuff as well as my taxi home, disposable income. That’s what the tips are for.”

Justyna, who works in a bar in Dunadry, County Antrim, said tips were indeed a ""top-up to wages"".

""It’s very important because waiters and waitresses are working hard, hoping they can get some form of tip. It makes a difference,"" she said.

“It's an absolute disgrace that managers can take tips, customers that are leaving tips are leaving them for the staff for good service.""

Taxi ride or walk home?
Neil Moore from Unite the Union highlighted the disparity faced by Northern Ireland's workers compared to their UK counterparts.

He said Stormont’s ""failure to implement fair tips legislation at the same time as Westminster"" was ""intolerable"".

“Unite has received near daily reports from workers sick and tired of having their tips deducted,"" he said.

“We’ve received reports of bosses fining workers for seemingly minor issues at work and workers having their whole night’s tips taken from them to pay for a customer who left without paying their bill.""

Prior to his current post as a union representative, Mr Moore worked in hospitality for over a decade.

He said he knew first-hand the challenges of relying on tips.

“Young women, in particular, often describe to us how earning tips can make the difference between an unsafe walk home alone in the early hours or being able to afford a taxi,"" he said.

Hospitality Ulster provides employers with guidance on tips to ensure the system is fair.

In the Hospitality Employer's Charter, external, Hospitality Ulster states: ""Tips received must be passed on to the appropriate staff, taking account of any collective staff agreements and taxes the employer is legally required to deduct.""

Colin Neil from the organisation previously told BBC News NI that ""generally, employers keeping tips is not an issue here"".

Liam, who works in a coffee shop in the centre of Belfast, said the law in Northern Ireland lagged behind the rest of the UK.

He said in a previous role in a bar the management ""would hold our tips for months and then we just would never get them"".

""They’d say, ‘we’re just paying back any stock we’ve lost' and we never saw any of it,"" he said.

However, Alex, a bar manager in Belfast, said tips in his establishment were dished out evenly.

The idea that management had any access to tips at all was ""ridiculous"", he said.

""Our managers here don't work bar service, so why should we have access to tips that are rewarded specifically for that exact service?""

However, he said tips were ""ever shrinking"" due to fewer people using cash.

""Hospitality is a hard job for entry-level employees, the pay is minimum wage, and the customer is rewarding employees on a personal level, it's Scrooge-esque to take away tips from employees that rely on them more than a manger would,"" he said.

Plans to introduce legislation
Draft legislation is currently being discussed in Stormont.

On 1 October, Democratic Unionist Party assembly member Stephen Dunne asked Economy Minister Conor Murphy whether his department had any plans to introduce legal protections for hospitality workers’ tips.

Murphy said: “My ‘Good Jobs’ Employment Rights Bill consultation invited views on a range of proposals to strengthen our employment rights framework to help deliver the Good Jobs agenda.""

""This included proposals to introduce new legislation to ensure that tips left to workers are passed on to them in full. The consultation closed on 30 September, and my department will now analyse the responses to inform next steps.”",0,1729438441.0,northernireland,8,0.2,False

Rant lang kasi im so drained na. Graduated last 2023, almost a year na nag wo-work, pero wala pa akong nabili for myself. I feel jealous sa mga ka batch kong workmates na nakabili na ng nmax, naka plan na ng trip abroad, may new iphone. Cuz it can never be me (I’d like to think na this situation is temporary, but until when?)

My dad retired early. He had like a million in retirement pay. Now, ubos na, literal zero. Mom ko nalang nag wo-work and almost half ng sweldo nya binabayad sa loans, tuition ni bunso, and everything else. I have 2 other siblings. Our eldest already has her own fam, so di na nakakahelp samin.

When I got my job, zero financial support na, which was understandable. I thought, finally, mabibili ko na mga gusto ko. Wanted to upgrade my phone, wanted braces, etc. 

Original agreement namin, ako magbibigay ng allowance ni bunso which is 2k per week, so thats 8k a month. I earn around 20-25k per month, so i thought sure kaya ko naman yan. That was about it. 

A few months later, humihingi na rin ang dad ko for their groceries at home. Just enough for their needs, around 3k lang per month. Plus everytime umuuwi ako (once every 2 wks), i treat them to lunch. 

Hanggang sa ni real talk nila ako about all their loans. Before retiring, my dad was a bank manager. Di kami naghirap even though we werent rich. All our needs and wants were provided for. When he retired, we went from upper middle to lower middle class. But i never expected na ang dami pala nilang utang. They want me to open a coop acct to loan 100k para pang bayad sa mga utang (and that loan wont even cover 1/4 sa mga utang nila).

Im just so frustrated. I cant be mad at them kasi now I know na kaya pala napagawa nila ang kwarto ko, kaya nakapag rent ako ng comfortable boarding house nung college, kaya may pang coffee shop ako every exam noon (my allowance was 3k per week) is because ni-loan nila lahat yun. They did all of that para comfortable kami sa college, lahat ng ni-loan nila is para rin samin. And now, im also paying the price. If only I knew all those things before.

Now, around half, and sometimes more than half pa ng sweldo ko ang nabibigay ko for my fam. Yung 3k allowance ko noon per week, good for 2 weeks na ngayon kasi nga nagbibigay pa ako ng allowance ni bunso, groceries sa bahay, plus may ma a-add pa if ever ma approve yung loan ko (to pay for their utangs). Halos nasa work lang ako palagi kasi I need overtimes para ma sustain ko lahat ng binabayaran ko now. Canned goods and karinderya nalang inuulam ko most of the time kasi i need to save money. Ang dami kong gustong bilhin para sa self ko. I thought pag may work na ako, i can be free to spend and go wherever I want. Since college, I never went on a vacation , never went on a night out bc i was busy studying (i had grades to maintain kasi free ang review for boards namin if we graduate with latin honors). And i achieved that. I thought everything will change once may work na ako. Pero no, mostly nasa work lang ako to earn extra and di ko na e-enjoy sweldo ko. 

As in sobrang hirap. I feel bad for my parents kasi I know di nila ginusto to. Na feel ko rin na naiilang na silang manghingi ng pera, but I cant help but feel so betrayed kasi bakit umabot sa ganito. Bakit hindi nila na manage ang finances namin.",1,1729438066.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False

1g816r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1g816r6/was_i_a_bitch/,Was I a bitch?,"I'm sorry so long, it's a vent combo...

I try to have a healthy attitude about my husband's drinking. It's his problem. It's not my responsibility. I cannot make him stop. Recovery is not a straight line. Boundaries, not ultimatums. It's not my fault.

He has a pint of whiskey every day, and at least one fifth on the weekend, but often 2. There was a football game yesterday, and his fifth disappeared over the course of 3 hrs. Normal stuff in general... Passed out for a while, peed on the bathroom rug, laid on the floor for a while, ate a meal then forgot and ate another one, knocked into walls, and then...

Let me say first that the dog is fine. (Autocorrect turned that into ""gone,"" and my heart skipped a beat, even tho he's literally 2' from me rn. Dogs truly are family.)

He fell toward me, into a lamp. I couldn't catch both, so we need a new lamp. I can't really catch him, but I did my best. He tried to stand back up, stumbled, and fell onto one of our dogs. He slowed the fall with his hands, I think. And like I said, the dog is ok.

The coffee table was right under his head. As far as I know, he didn't hit his head at all.

But he fell on the fucking dog and he almost cracked his head on a solid wood table. They both could've been seriously hurt or killed.

I did the good wife thing. I made sure no one was hurt, told him to stay on the floor while I checked the dog and picked up the lamp. Of course he didn't, bc he's stubborn af, but he managed to get onto the couch.

He started crying and apologizing. Tbh, I hate that. I don't want apologies. I want effort. I *know* he didn't mean to. And that means nothing. It's not like bones un-break if you don't mean to break them. I know it hurts him. But I can't break down every time he does. I wouldn't survive.

After maybe 10 mins, he'd stopped anyway, and idk if he even remembered what had happened. He started to play depressing music, which makes me wanna scream. It's always the same 5-ish songs, and half of them are about men fucking up marriages or drinking themselves to death. It makes me so angry I get nauseous.

I have already set the boundary that I will go to my room when that starts. (I've been in the basement bedroom for 2 yrs now, I think.) So I closed the blinds and checked the locks, getting ready to go.

So he had to go to bed, too. I tried to get him to agree to stay his ass on the couch. Nope. His back hurt (wonder why) so he had to go to bed. He at least waited for me to be able to hold him up on the way. I got him settled and went to my space.

And lost it. They both could've needed serious care. I couldn't take him to the ER and the dog to the EV at the same time, and I didn't have a plan ready for that kind of situation. And if he did hit his head, I could wake up and find his body. That's why I'm in another room. I compulsively wake up to check his breathing through the night if we sleep together.

I speed-ran panic, anger and sadness. Then tried to work out a plan in my head. How to tell him what happened, whether to take the dogs to my room if he drinks, etc.

In the process of everything, I forgot to take my evening meds (genetic condition), so I slept like 12 hrs and woke up sick. Still up before him. Anyway, after we had breakfast, I told him. 

He said he'd quit this time, so I asked if he wanted local/online support resources. Nope. How dare I suggest such a thing. He'll just quit on his own.

I blurted out what I was thinking. ""Yeah, bc that's worked so well."" That solidified me as the bad guy. That snark was ""the worst part."" Yep. Almost killing the dog is so not worse than me saying that.

And what kills me is that it's true! The longest he's ever gone without drinking was a few months. Why? Bc it's not about the alcohol! It's about the underlying stuff that he cannot address on his own. He'd rather be completely miserable for the rest of his life, and drag me down with him, than admit that he's not king shit of fuck mountain. Just a regular man who needs and deserves help.

When we met, we both drank way too much bc of underlying stuff. I was 19. Now I'm 40. I've done a shitton of therapy work. I'm not perfect by any measure. But I'm so much better. The whole time, he's just stayed drunk. That's it. The only change has been escalaying from beer to whiskey and mouthwash. Ngl, the resentment is real.

So, am I a bitch for being blunt and telling it like it is? I genuinely don't wanna shame him into not seeking help.",2,1729437875.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

I contacted support and they are sending me a new one, so no issues with support (I’m waiting the new one), but I’m concerned for if it will happen again, and if this grinder is so bad..

Her “apology” was the typical “sorry if I ever hurt you” — which to me felt like she was basically refusing to take full accountability for the years of pain she caused.

I told her I’m done — no more meeting, no more reconnection. I feel like she’s just trying to ease her own guilt without truly recognizing what she did. But after sending that email and declining her invitation, it’s me that’s now relapsing emotionally, and all those old wounds are resurfacing.

I am 30yo man. I had very successful and nice life, kinda messy, but kinda stable, until I got diagnosed with ADHD. It happened to me in a very painful way. I contacted CBT therapist about 9 months ago, I came with only 2 problems: sleeping issues (going sleep very late, like 4-5am, sometimes even in the morning, like 8-9am) and problems with maintaining meaningful relations, which also led to many impulsive sexual behaviors, which I also wanted to stop. I was very successful work wise, I had many friends, some self confidence issues but I masked it well with all my work successes. My therapist suggested that I might have ADHD, but at this moment I was like: yeah, whetever, I might have it, I might not have it, what does it change? I feel well and I don't feel I need to be medicated, so why would we even bother? But she told me that we NEED TO diagnose it before we start CBT program.

I left my country to work online in South East Asia. I was there for a month with my friend and then he left. I was there completely alone, for the first time in my life I had no one around me. I thought it's gonna be a nice experience, because I traveled a lot for like last 10 years with other ppl. And since I had so much time, I decided to resume my therapy. We started to diagnose ADHD, it came out it's ""probably positive"". In the meantime my grandma went to the hospital and I had a little emotional crisis. I cried for the first time in probably 10+ years, but after few hours I was completely fine, I shut off my emotions like I always did. After a week I had my first anxiety/panic attack, but I just thought it was because of the coffee I drunk on the empty stomach. Week later I had anxiety/panic attack again, it also happened with coffee on empty stomach, also it happened after eating in the same restaurant. I told my therapist about attacks and she was like: yeah yeah it looks like a panic attack, don't be afraid, they always pass and you will be fine. She kinda said it like it was completely normal thing for an adult person.

When we finished ADHD diagnose. She was like: ""oh we have to check one more thing"", but she didn't want to tell me what. We made tests. By the questions I got, I was sure we are diagnosing depression. We finished the diagnose and she was like: ""it came negative! Do you know what did we check? BPD! But it's all fine, you don't need to worry, it's negative. I had to check it because BPD and ADHD are very similar, so I had to make sure"". And when I heard that ADHD and BPD are similar I just got crazy about wtf is ADHD then. I focused on all the negative sides of ADHD, I started to find all these attributes in myself. Just imagine, I am completely alone 15k km from my home, I just had the worst time of my life, first panic attacks, my grandma is in hospital, I am thinking only about how bad grandson I am because I didn't visit her in a long time. And then the only person I am talking to regularly secretly made BPD tests on me.

That was the moment when my life turned upside down. The last month I stayed in Asia was the worst time of my life. My body was extremely tense because of the anxiety. I was completely alone there, just me and my computer connected to the internet. All I did was googling what is ADHD, what is wrong with this. I started to realized how weird I am. I always thought I am different but in like a good way, I liked to be different and my whole life was a proof that I am right and everyone else is wrong. Everything I liked about myself just got ruined in one moment. The anxiety was so huge that I couldn't sleep. I had small derealization episodes. I was even afraid to go back home, even tho I made like 50+ flights in my life.

When I came back to my hometown, I started to visit my therapists again. All she was saying was: Don't worry, it's gonna be better, it's normal to feel worse when starting therapy bla bla bla. I continued therapy for another 6 months. Last month, she came back from 1 month vacation. After resuming therapy my anxiety got so bad that I had to take take Xanax, after 2 weeks of taking Xanax I got prescribed mirtazapine.

My life is one huge mess right now, I have huge General Anxiety Disorder and I have no idea how to cope with it. I don't think I ever had anxiety attacks before that trip, and now I am waking up and I ""feel weird"" 24/7. I feel like my body is so tense. I can't focus on anything, 95% of my thoughts are negative. I tried mindfullness and relaxation techniques, but it's almost impossible to me for stay still for a longer period. I wasn't like that. I had small ""depression"" episodes before, but I wouldn't even call it a real depression. But now I just don't know who I am anymore, who should I be, I am afraid to travel again, I am even afraid to go out from my home very often. I am afraid about my physical health, my mental health, my family. I felt like I had everything under my control before that trip and now I lost it all. That's such a weird feeling. I am also thinking about these derealzation episodes a lot and I always look around and ask myself ""is it happening to me again?"". I finally decided to leave my CBT therapist and went to psychodynamic guy. I am also afraid about opening to him as well. I just feel lost and hopeless.

1g80xhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g80xhd/messed_up_my_brain_with_magnesium/,Messed up my brain with magnesium,"
**TL;DR:** experienced magnesium overdose symptoms after taking a high dose. Now I'm hypersensitive to magnesium, caffeine, and any brain-interacting substances. 

I suspect insufficient NMDA synaptic activity and acetylcholine buildup in my brain. Doctors just dismiss it as anxiety.  

I'm desperate for help to stabilize my brain and body after this sudden onset of symptoms.

If someone here is knowledgeable about brain function and can provide insights, or knows a professional who might have the expertise to do so - I'd really appreciate it if you can read this and share your thoughts.


—

I’m (30M, 5.8ft, 139lbs) trying to figure out what’s going on in my brain and how to get out of it. 




Following very high magnesium dose, I got overdose symptoms (heart palpitations, tremors, brain fog and cognitive impairment).  
None of these happened to me in the past. 
I’ve rushed to the ER, but once they got to check me, it got somewhat stabilized. They found nothing wrong upon inspection. Serum magnesium was okay (on the lowest range).

Since then, I’m getting the same “magnesium overdose” symptoms over and over again, together with hypersensitivity to substances:

- It happens again (on a different scale) when I drink mineral water (probably supplemented with mag), and with high magnesium food intake.  
- Even a small sip of caffeine - either from coffee or green tea - makes my heart go racing.
- I tried taking a sprinkle of magnesium supplement, just to test the reaction - and immediately got heart palpitations.
- I also started to react extremely to anything that interacts with the brain.  
For example, I took a small dose (0.5mg) of Prucalopride, which occasionally helps me with constipation. I never had side effects using it, but this time I experienced 16 hours of constant bowel movements. 

The closest thing I found that could explain what’s going on is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/preeclampsia/comments/1c2eous/side_effects_from_magnesium_drip_afterwards/), which includes a detailed comment by a neuroscience student to a woman who had magnesium drip, and experienced symptoms similar to what I have. 

He describes these symptoms as **insufficient NMDA synaptic activity**: In the brain, magnesium controls the voltage of calcium channels, and the more magnesium in the brain, the much less likelihood that the neurons will be depolarized and fire off. 

It makes sense to me, but I'm not sure how to treat it safely considering my hypersenstivity.

—

**Now, to make it worse:**

A few days ago, with the advice of an alternative health practitioner (who was aware of the magnesium mess!), I took Huperzine A + Alpha GPC [using this supplement](https://secure.vagusnervesupport.com/collections/supplements/products/parasym-plus%E2%84%A2?variant=15347315572800).  

I’m trying to treat my dysfunctional ileocecal valve, which this supplement was developed to help with. I tried taking it in the past without issues or side effects. 

I had no idea that it would lead me to what seems like a cholinergic crisis, and spend the night in the ER.

It resulted in clenched throat, narrow airways and extreme histamine sensitivity (something that was [reported here too](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/d6ikua/huperzine_a_histamine/)), in addition to depression, anxiety and lack of motivation, probably due to the excessive acetylcholine buildup.

Now any choline/histamine foods immediately make me sick for days, and my diet has become extremely limited. Again, I never had any of this before. It all started after the magnesium overdose.

—

I've stopped all supplementation now, but I feel in such big trouble - my health is getting worse every day. I could handle the magnesium symptoms more easily, but since the choligenic crisis I've become bedridden and cannot work. I am desperately looking for help to stabilize my brain and get my life back.

I’ve tried several doctors who either have no idea what’s going on or dismiss it as an anxiety attack. I never had issues with anxiety or mental illness. I'm almost certain it's related to the excess magnesium in the brain which started this mess, but no one seems to understand this since it's so rare.

I would really appreciate any ideas or thoughts on what's going on and how to approach this. And if you happen to know any professionals with deep understanding on the matter who might help me sort this out, I'd be so grateful.

Around two weeks ago, my mother had a small accident - she didn't notice a doorstep and fell on both of her knees. She's already had some health conditions related to her knees, had a knee surgery half a year ago and went to rehab twice after that. That's why the accident was an extreme bad luck for her as she damaged her knees even more. Now, she's walking around the house with the help of crutches, can't go out for the time being and can't bend one of her knees or stand on the leg.

That's why me, my younger sister and our dad need to help out around the house more because my mom isn't able to do much at the moment. She can't walk while holding any objects as she needs to hold the crutches and doing anything, like cooking, is more difficult for her now.

I'm happy to help and truth be told, I've really been doing a lot this past week. I was going shopping nearly every day (before the accident, it was something my mother would do and sometimes I would help out too, but it wasn't often), I was bringing my mom any objects she would ask for - coffee she made herself in the kitchen, foods, medicines, water bottles, literally anything, I was cleaning the kitchen, etc. In general, I took on myself many chores that previously belonged to my mom.

That's where the problem starts - my mother claims that she's tired of having to ask me for everything and she wants me to figure out on my own that I should do something, for example clean the kitchen or notice that there's an empty plate next to her in her room that I can bring back to the kitchen and put in the dishwasher. 

However, I am not the smartest person in the world, I've never been good at tasks that need ""figuring out"" what to do. I prefer being given clear instructions and then go along with them. I'm not much perceptive and I often don't notice little details around me even if I try my best to see if there's anything that should be done by me.

Because of that, I often miss out on things my mom wants me to do around the house and this leads to her getting mad at me. In those moments, even if I ask her what I could do to help, she doesn't tell me anything and only gets angrier because I continue to not figure it out on my own.

My sister doesn't have such problem - she's younger, so my mother always tells her what she wants her to do. I wish it was the case with me. My mom never gets angry at my sister for not helping out while with me, it feels like she doesn't appreciate everything that I'm already doing (when she isn't in a bad mood and gives me instructions on what to do, I always do it) but instead only focuses on the part that I'm not clever and I can't figure out on my own that something needs to be done. She claims that I'm not helping enough and it feels like she strongly believes that, but I'm doing my best here and I don't know how to navigate this situation.

I just moved here this summer from Sarnia and my bf moved from Woodstock, so we are used to traffic both on the street (as a car) and in the street (on foot) being much busier and better coordinated.
Everywhere we go theres people driving UNDER the speed limit, nearly causing accidents for people literally obeying the speed limit. Like you arent driving safer by being a hazard on the road??
Also its the WORST insode of stores. People park thier cart in the way of stuff you are literally actively looling at just to walk 10ft away and windowshop. Im not kidding this has happened to me literally every single time we go to a grocery store. Never been anywhere where people are so obstructive with thier carts, AND just look around aimlessly like they've got all day to be there and walk so slow that they make sure they make the 20 min grocery run into a 45min hassle because its fuckin cart-to-ankles down every isle while people stare at every single product on the shelf.
Like honestly you wouldnt be caught dead with this spacey mannerisms in a big city, youd be pickpocketed every time you left the house, and youd have people barking at you everywhere you go to get out of the fkn way. Just being honest. 
Like the other day I went to get just milk, i walk up to the milk section, no cart, step back middle of the aisle (like a normal person) to look and this braindead lady parks her cart right infront of the glass display case for the milk i was about to grab then stands INFRONT of me to look at creamer as if i didnt exist. After like 3 whole minutes of standing in disbeleif, surely she didnt just see me looking and put her cart directly infront of the thing i was looking at. I didnt wanna stand there all day waiting so after she had a few minutes of starring at the tiny selection of coffee creamer without making a choice had to tell her to move her cart. Felt like a freak having to boss strangers around in public like that but i was honestly so floored about everyone in any store walking around like theyre the only person in the world.

I mean, I know it had; I was buzzed, not completely wasted. But it still seemed surreal...how often do you reconnect with your friend's mom who you haven't seen in 20 years...and then proceed to eat her pussy on the kitchen counter like shed served it you on a plate and demanded you dig in? I was very unsure of what was going to happen next. But I, like you, wanted to see where this was headed.

I walked out into the hallway and looked over to the dining area (so the hall where my room was opened out into this huge area that was the kitchen, dining table area, living room, and tv area...really big so all I have to do is poke my head out and I could see everything). She was sitting at the table with some coffee and her laptop (doing nurse things I guess). I entered the kitchen and started to search for a cup so I could have some water or milk, when suddenly she's behind me holding a cup of coffee out to me. ""Here,"" she says,"" I poured one for you already."" I'm not a coffee drinker but I took the cup anyway, not wanting to be ungrateful. ""Thanks,"" I said, with a kind of nervous edge in my voice (my heart was pounding) and a smile. She gestures at the table without looking at me and asks,""join me?"" I sat of course, how am I gonna find out where we stand if I avoid her? At this point, I gotta say, I was nervous as hell. A part of me was worried that she would believe that we couldn't coexist with the previous night's events hanging between us. That it would cause too much tense awkwardness and I would have to find other living arrangements.

So I sat, while she went back to her laptop, me thinking of the best way to plead my case to stay (and if that didn't work, then I would at least beg for a repeat of last night...yea she was hot enough I would beg!) I started to deliver my opening statement but she cut me off. ""Hey--"" ""So last night was something. Where'd you learn that?"" My eyes snapped to her face. She had her elbow propped up on the table, with her hand cupping her chin and leaning into it, (I don't know how else to describe the position but you all know what I mean) staring at me with her eyes narrowed a bit, but in curiosity not scrutiny.

My mind was wiped of logical reasoning...""porn,"" I said like an idiot (it sounded stupid to me). She laughed (like really laughed, not a giggle) Once composed a bit, she asked,"" And you planned to use it on someone who looked like the ones in those videos?"" ""They don't even come close to you {her name}"" ""I'm twice your age--,"" ""And have a better body than any I've seen on anyone"" (spreading the butter) She studied me for a second, then said,"" you didn't even see me fully naked last night."" ""I can put a puzzle together"" (wink) (I'm referring to the nude) She laughed again. I said, ""I bet you have more on your phone that I would enjoy."" ""Maybe, but what makes you think I'm showing you?""

At this, I snatched her phone up off the table, said,""I'll find them myself,"" and booked it to my room (I didn't really have any intention of going through her phone, but I needed her to follow me). She shot after me like expected but FUCK she was fast. I charged into my room and threw myself onto my bed, pulling her phone towards my face. A second later, I feel her dive onto my back. She was fit, fast, and agile but I had reach. I kept her phone away from her while she scrambled around on my back, whilst my other hand held her from crawling up my back closer to her phone. She almost had it too, but I tucked it into my chest and curled sideways, her still clinging to me trying to get it. A little more wrestling and she rolled me onto my back and (I shit you not) planted herself into my chest with a flop (bottom of my ribcage area) At the same time, we realized the position I'd gotten us into and it clicked.

She dove at my face with hers (I tossed her phone aside and used my now free hands to pull her hips lower so she was laying on top of me). The same intensity of our make out session the night before, our tongues in a kind of tug of war between us, her pulling on my lower lip with her teeth like she planned to rip it off. Meanwhile she had begun to grind on my dick like she could dissolve my clothes by rubbing hard enough (I chose the wrong morning/almost noon to wear jeans). I sat up, so I was on the edge of the bed with her still in my lap, and pulled her tank top (I think she had been getting ready to go to the gym) up over her head, revealing a damn sports bra I would have torn to shreds for it was the only thing between me and her amazing tits.

She took it off, quickly, and in the absolute best way possible. As if in slow motion, in my eyes, she grabbed the front and pulled up, bringing her tits up as high as they would go with the bra. Then the bra let go and they dropped/bounced with the most sexiest (in my opinion) jiggle ever in the history of boobs. I was so awestruck you think I'd never seen boobs before (I felt like an anime guy who was seeing a pair of glorious tits, I thought blood would shoot out of my nose too!) Easy, she was a 38DD (I do my research) and they were perfectly round (I later found out she had gotten some surgery done to keep them perky). I punched in my timecard and got to work.

Her surgery had not been the enhancing kind, so her tits were beautifully soft and perfect for handfuls with plenty of spillage on my hands. Her nipples were the perfect pink and as I pushed her tits together they winked at me before I jammed them both into my mouth (yes both, I had to). Apparently her tits were as sensitive as her clit cause she began to squeal and grind her hips even harder into mine. I then alternated between them, keeping a nipple in my mouth: sucking, licking, putting it between my teeth while my other hand teased and squeezed the other.

Her face started turning red and I knew my work was doing its job. I've worked so many pairs of tits (once I worked 3 boobs, a pair on my face and my hand on one other) I knew how to work them and what order to do it in.

She whispered in my ear,"" not just me..."" She got up out of my lap, taking her tights off as she went. She was wearing underwear this time but it came away with the tights so I wouldn't waste any time (I ripped off my jeans at the same time). She walked up to me, shoved me back onto the bed, and swung her leg over me, climbing onto my chest but facing the other direction so her ass was inches from my face. I fully admired how great her ass was for only a second before she pushed it into my face as she went for the dripping pole that was my cock.

Imagine a massage by the softest hands, slowly getting warmer until it feels fuzzy, with the pressure of a high powered vacuum. Now put that all together on your dick. That's what I felt: pure, cum pumping, bliss. Her mouth was like something I had never felt before: her lips weren't just moving back and forth on my cock, her entire mouth (tongue, cheeks, roof) was pressed firmly around my dick. She was literally ""sucking me off"" not like some hollow blowjobs I had received in the past. And the noise! Sloppy, noisy blowjobs really do something for me. I could feel the cum being pulled up from my balls, like a really thick milkshake that comes up really slowly through the straw.

I had been in such heaven that I hadn't noticed her pussy dripping juice on my face. By the time I realized it, before I could even start, I could feel my cum rocketing through my shaft. ""Oh fuck,"" was all I could get out before blowing my load. SHE DIDN'T MISS A SINGLE BEAT. She kept going with that same, high pressure sucking. I know I was literally shooting cum into the back of her throat but she didn't pull back, I didn't even feel a drop of cum land on my dick. Just before it got too sensitive, she let go...and cut off my air supply by thrusting her pussy into my mouth.

Eating pussy isn't easy for me, especially when it's turned upside down. It just changes the rules, but I was determined. How could I not be after what I just got? Was I left hanging last night after the service I provided? Yea, but she had more than made up for it in my mind. My tongue lapped at her clit, my nose was almost buried in her asshole (which was fresh, good hygiene is important), and my hands had reached up and started squeezing her tits/nipples. Meanwhile, through her moaning and squealing, I felt her grab my cock and slowly started stroking it. She was bringing him back to life for another round! I focused all my energy into doing so. Less than a minute later (her hands were like magic) he was ready! She leaned forward, wrapped her velvety mouth around my cock, and began to churn another load in my balls like butter made in the old days. This time she was using her hand too, twisting my cock with each pulling her mouth made.

I focused on the task at hand: I wanted a face full of squirt again. I worked her clit with everything I had (my jaw was hurting a little by this point but I'm no quitter). Anytime she lifted her ass a bit to get a second to rest, my face came with it. She used her other hand and spread her ass apart for me, giving me more room to work with. I used my other hand and pulled her other cheek to spread it even wider. I switched between lapping at her clit and shoving my tongue in her pussy, trying to find her g-spot with no hands. I must have found it a couple times for I could feel her pussy contract a few times.

Anyone who beats their meat regularly knows that busting a second nut takes longer than the first, but she had me ready to go as if it were my first round (I swear, her mouth is the only thing I miss as much as her tits). She spoke first,"" I'm gonna CUM!"" The way she said cum, with an animal like desire (no...NEED) opened my balls.

I released as she took a particularly hard pull on my cock. At the same time, her floodgates opened and I was taking another shower, although much warmer. My mouth filled with her juices (I wasn't sure at the time if actually drinking it was right or even good.... actually I'm still not sure) so I let it fill my mouth and pour out the sides. When I say she gushed, I mean she GUSHED. You could waterboard someone with as much as she squirted (maybe even drown someone) STILL FUCKING HOT.

I know I had shot rope after rope of nut into her mouth, yet not a single drop remained. She dropped beside me on the bed, her hand feeling the wet of my hair. ""It doesn't bother you?"" she asked? ""The wet? Nah."" She smiled, "" ok good, cause I do that a lot."" ""I noticed."" She kissed me (in all honesty, I'm not the biggest fan of kissing someone after having just been blown, for fear of getting my own cum on my mouth. But since not a single drop had passed from lips, a 2 load pile in her stomach, I had no second thoughts) I kissed her back.

We both knew we weren't going to have sex right there. I know it would take a lot for me to get it back up and we each had things we needed to do that day. It wasn't said, but we both knew it was going to happen eventually. I mean, how could it not? I had already done more with her than I had in a few quick one night stands.

She stood up and gathered her clothes and her phone from the floor while I watched from the bed. As she crossed the room to the door, I got up and walked up behind her. I spanked her bare ass hard, grabbing a rough handful, making sure to leave my handprint on it. She looked back at me with bit of a shocked smile. I smiled too. ""Yea, that,"" was all I said. She left my room with red handprint on her right ass cheek, marked.

The day I submit I was running on a slice of buttered toast and copious amounts of coffee. I submitted right on midnight. There was no fanfare (it's just the two of us in the apartment). There was no ""congratulations"". The next day we went to brunch and all i got was a ""well done"".

 For the first time in my life I have no option to consume, and it's led to a lot more mental clarity, less anxiety, and more free time. It's crazy how much of my day was spent making another pot of coffee or driving to the grocery store/McDonalds.

Hope you all are happy and healthy.

Reposting for visibility - here's to optimism and not giving up.

I am a 35 year old single nerd (yes, very unique on reddit), both in personal and professional life. I am an expat living in the Netherlands but originally from India(oh dear, Indian, run away!! )

Still here?... well read on..

I have been away from home for more than 12 years, for both educational and professional reasons. Last 2 years were spent in the Netherlands. I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am just looking for a connection - be it only friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but the latter is not going so well as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within day-trip distances.

Life has had some huge changes lately and I’m just taking in the difference.  I was living in a household of 5 people and 3 cats and a lizard in August. Now I’m 2600 km (1600+ miles) from there. I’m living with one person and two cats. There’s 3/4ths of a pumpkin pie sitting on the stove and the asparagus fern (far far away from Patty and Selma the cats) I got two days after moving just developed one of the largest fronds I’ve seen. 

It’s so quiet here. My last home was on a busy intersection that no one operated properly (2 way stop, either no one stopped or it was treated as a 4 way) in a rough neighborhood with a lot of people on substances.  Now it’s just a quiet street, sometimes a car goes a little too fast but we are on a hill. 

I have a job I’m good at. The hour commute on the bus gives me time to read books which is something I forgot I enjoy doing. It gives me time to face the day. 

I miss my lil clique of friends, but we talk all day, every day in our group chat. I miss my family of 5, but I had to change things for myself. There was so much happening all the time and I was always so overwhelmed. 

My partner is sipping coffee on the couch and the cats are looking out the window at a squirrel on a quiet road. I’m drinking coffee in the kitchen with the counter at my back, admiring my plant, wondering what book I want to read this week.

I'm hoping some of you have been here a while and know the Madison alternative scene well. I moved out of state for a while and I'm trying to find out if the Lakeside Street parties (or something similar) are still a thing.

Some really cool local women launched some private foot and shoe modeling parties parties for local veterans. Those eventually grew and became the Wisconsin Heels parties out of that group.

These same people used to hold monthly discussion meetings at the coffee shop, with parties at some private homes in the area. So far, I'm not finding anything like this (I already tried The Crucible and FetLife).   
  
I’m wondering if any of the organizers are still around or if anything similar is going on. If not, I'm wondering what online groups or other places would be good for starting something like this again.

1g80dkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1g80dkv/elysian_parfum_review/,Elysian Parfum Review,"https://imgur.com/a/8tUHitR

I haven't seen anything about this newish house born in 2021, located in Georgia USA, so I thought I'd talk about it a little if that's alright. I was hoping to find reviews on reddit after being inundated with ads for this house but I'll be the guinea pig instead. I've been into fragrance for years but I've never done a review before so this will be lackluster. 

I bought both of Elysian Parfums sample sets, Lineage and Alchemy. You can customize the set and I lean toward unisex and feminine fragrance so that's what I'll review. Their most popular scent, Lavender Tea, was out of stock unfortunately. In December they'll release a Tea themed sample set I might get. 

All fragrances appear to be listed as Extrait which is very believable because it leaves an oil slick on my skin after spray. Their sillage is quite pungent in their first hour, becoming skin scents after 3 hours and offering about 6 hours of longevity. This hold true for all the scents. Black Forest probably has the best longevity and sillage.  You could probably eek out 8-10 hours on clothes for the strongest scents.

Their packaging is pretty, but disappoint anyways. Most of the documents included had strange product names, I'm guessing they renamed and forgot to print new pamphlets. Got duplicates of some of their ""art cards"" with the notes on the back as well.  The sprayers on the lineage collection are quite nice while the alchemy collection sprayers dribble. They also fell out of their case during shipping. 

On to the juice.

Fairest of them all
Listed Notes: red juicy apples, cassis, marine, peony, fresh pear, violet, caramel, brown sugar, tonka bean, musk, blonde woods

Very sweet, apple-y with a peony pop. After about an hour the fruitiness leaves. It becomes sweet floral. A bitter note, like burnt caramel hides in the background. In 3 hours it loses the bitterness and becomes a sweet violet. 

Moon Petals
Listed Notes: marine, pink peppercorn, orange blossom, jasmin grandiflorum, jasmin sambac, whipped cream, peaches, coconut milk, sweet violet, ambroxan, creamy vanilla, cashmere wood, sandalwood, ambrette, soft musk

My nose literally recoiled into my face.  Listed Notes sounded great but they do not work for me. It smells sweaty and a little.. minty for some reason?? I get a hint of milk but it's an overwhelming scent that I'm mad I have such a large sample of. 


Charmante
Listed Notes: Fresh dewy pear blossom, apricot, pink champagne, exotic jasmine, toasted almond, black vanilla, blonde woods, patchouli, creamy amber

I misread this as pear and was confused because it's very floral. Rereading, I realize it's pear BLOSSOM and wow does it sing. Extremely sweet and extremely floral, I get a little of the bubbly champagne and the almond which comes off as cherry in this blend. It smells a little like a psychics shop I visited as a child. Becomes a delicate floral in dry down. 

Temple of Echoes
Listed Notes: neroli blossom, cardamom, coconut milk, saffron, ginger, black pepper, Madagascar vanilla, cashmere, Australian sandalwood, amber, oud, musk, tonka, vetiver 

I guess it's the saffron that gives gauzy hospital vibes? There is no sharpness or pop from the spicy scents listed such as ginger, cardamom, pepper. There is no smoothness from the vanilla or cashmere. My nose is in an Emergency Medkit. 

Coco and Capri
Listed Notes: marine, ozone, fresh pear, juicy pineapple, coconut, birch exotic jasmine, sandalwood tropical woods, white musk

Largely woods with a dash of fruity sweetness. A hint of pencil shavings. 

Jalous 
Listed Notes: smoky pineapple, creamy vanilla, bold bergamot, bright apples, sweet saffron, and exotic jasmine

For once the notes seem spot on. Opening with a grilled pineapple scent, the deeper you sniff, the more scents you unlock but the pineapple is firmly there.
Becomes more masculine with time, offering a woodsy note. 

Time and Tide
Listed Notes: Sea salt, ozone, fresh linen, white floral, tonka bean, vanilla, sandalwood

Definitely achieved the written notes. This smells like laundry detergent. Very clean. Very fresh. Doesn't smell sun dried or ozonic.

Black Forest Bourbon
Listed Notes: Barrel-aged rum, smooth bourbon, Luxardo cherries, roasted coffee, dark chocolate, rose, vanilla, caramel, almond, sandalwood

At first spray I was in love but the dry down was confusing. It does smell like cherry without being cough-droppy but there's an odd note... Cardboard? I detect rose during a deep sniff and I guess cherry+rose= cardboard??? It's a jammy rose that I don't detest but I don't think I could wear this.

Everbloom
Listed Notes: Bergamot, pears, jasmine, lily of the valley, tuberose, orange flower, gardenia, marine, sandalwood, white musk, creamy coconut

Bubblegum. That is all.

Amaranthine
Listed Notes: Cassis, lychee, mandarin, peony, lily, jasmine, patchouli, peach musk,  vanilla, praline, cedar, sandalwood, violet, ambrette, chantilly musk

The most delicate scent in the lineup. Everything is gentle, understated, blended, clean. A perfume for the people who can't wear perfume. One or two sprays would be a delicate whiff of... Something? Inoffensive, quiet, office like. 

Island Muse
Listed Notes: Marine, bay water, citrus, coconut, lime, mandarin, tropical fruits, Indian jasmine, hibiscus, sugar cane, vanilla musk, wood, pepper

The pepper is very forward. I get coconut, lime, cedar in the dry down. A fresh summer scent. 

I wish I had more to say about these but there's not much to write home about. I've been wearing them for a couple weeks now hoping to fall in love but I can't justify the price of a FB or even a traveller for any of these. The samples are massive 3 and 5ml which is plenty since I'm not a fan of any of them. 

If I had to pick favorites, Jalous is #1 for being a nice pineapple scent with unique undertones.

Black Forest Bourbon is #2 for it's delicious cherry and jammy rose that just smells wrong on me, I think.

Time and Tide gets a special mention for being photorealistic laundry. 

Feel free to ask me questions, leave advice for better reviews, or whatever. I usually just sniff, never review.",4,1729435698.0,fragrance,2,1.0,False

I had already bought a Bialetti replacement gasket, so I decided to pop it in.  Success!  Both assembly and disassembly were much easier, and the coffee was rich and strong again.

However, another problem emerged, which was that the flavor was a bit bitter.  I eventually resolved this by lowering the water temperature.  Previously, I had been microwaving the water to about 150F while I loaded the grounds.  I cut that down to 110F, and now the flavor is perfect.  I dare say it tastes better than it ever did before.

So, whereas some people report that their gaskets last forever, mine definitely did not.  And the replacement gasket seems to work better than the original ever did.

1g8090w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1g8090w/msc_meraviglia_marvelous_experience/,MSC Meraviglia - marvelous experience!,"Just returned from my first ever cruise, a 7 night round trip cruise to Bermuda. It was also my partner’s first cruise. We both have intense jobs and were very much looking forward to this trip, and it did not disappoint!

Of note, we paid an amazing price ($330 per person for an interior cabin, plus about $140 in taxes/fees and $120 in gratuities), so we tried to manage our expectations accordingly - at that price, we would be more than okay with some bland food, watery coffee etc. But overall we were quite impressed with the food. 

FOOD 8/10 Not every item was a winner, but there was always something delicious to eat in the buffet, and we enjoyed everything we ate in the main dining room with the exception of one oversalted pasta dish one night and some weird octopus (but I knew that risk when I ordered marinated octopus on a cruise haha!).

ENTERTAINMENT 7/10 I love live music, dancing and broadway musicals, so the shows were right up my alley. Overall we felt the performers were quite talented, clearly had formal training in singing and dancing, overall the shows were enjoyable and on par with some lesser Broadway productions I have seen lol. Obviously a bit quick (45 min), no plot - more of a montage, and a little repetitive but still enjoyable.

STAFF 10/10 We felt extremely well taken care of by the friendly and hardworking staff. Our steward and waitress were both excellent and lovely to chat with. I will note, there was a busy day at brunch one day, and it took a while to get water and coffee - I did not care but the people sitting next to us were very upset, asked to speak to a manager, were saying things like “Never taking MSC again,” “Awful service” etc. They were speaking a non-English language and probably did not realize I understood them. I suspect a lot of bad reviews about MSC service are from cruisers who react pretty strongly to inconveniences that to us felt very trivial.

SHIP 7/10 We were pretty cozy in our interior cabin (was quite spacious) and our favorite spot to hang was the Sky Lounge - spent hours reading on a couch there. The Aquapark was fun too. However, the hot tubs were not hot enough anywhere… this was our biggest gripe, they needed to be a few degrees warmer to be enjoyable. It would also have been nice to have more places on board to lounge, more couches etc. But overall the ship was beautiful and clean. Lots of big waves and rocking in each direction - we thought it was fun but I’m sure would be harder for cruisers with limited mobility.

DESTINATION 10/10 Bermuda was beautiful, safe, people were friendly, and it was super easy to get around by bus/ferry if you are patient. We paid $44 for a 3 day transport pass and took the bus and ferry everywhere. Virtually all the beaches are free and we have our own snorkels so we just left the ship every day and traveled around the island and explored. Highly recommend the Swizzle Inn, Tobacco Bay (best 🐟 🐠 🐙!) and Elbow Beach. We also found a cool snorkel spot called Parson’s Bay walking distance from the ship.

Overall, we would absolutely go on another MSC cruise. Having done both luxury and budget trips before, we were thoroughly impressed by the value we got for what we paid and were especially impressed by the staff. Don’t let bad reviews fool you, if you are easygoing with the right mindset you will have an amazing time!",3,1729435344.0,Cruise,1,0.81,False

Long story short, this community helped me make the right decision to get into manual brewing methods hence got a Moka Pot and a French Press to get things started. Found both the methods interesting in how coffee can turn out just by way of its brewing method! 

As i was checking out more videos, came across this one from James: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8)

Now since i had already brewed coffee using the french press, i understood that there was ample room for improvement, reducing the sludge for starters. So gave Hoffmann my nod and tried his way and; my oh my, did it work! Not only was the taste better, it was a lot clearer and looked awesome in a full glass cup. Too bad i did not take pics. Maybe next time i will share.

Has anyone else tried his method and how did it turn out for you? Any other methods to try?

The only exception is on Saturday mornings ill go get a coffee before practice rather than wine. 

If i am being honest with myself, i know i lose hella focus after that sip of wine and i know it doesn’t benefit me in anyway when i practice. I like to think that it helps me loosen up and prepares me to practice after a day at work but in reality it takes away the mental focus that i need for practice. 


This morning i woke up to get some coffee than I decided to take a jog. That was a great combo and my practice was sharp this morning.

I really thought he was the one and I love him. The problem is is that he still lives with his parents and works in a cafe and I am quite high up in my career and own my own house. The first issue is that I have had a really tough time at work recently. He gets frustrated with me because I care “too much” about my job. I’ve explained that it is not always like this and I’ve just had a bad week and am unable to split myself in two- I’m trying to keep my head above water and sort things at work and then afterwards I will feel back to normal. I have not ignored him or intentionally been distant with him since the stuff at work has been kicking off but I have just ended up spending more time finishing assignments and going into work as I am needed. The second issue is that he has borrowed money from me a few times, and yes he does pay me back, and yes he has paid for things such as meals out, holidays etc. But it gives me the ick when he does it. Last time he asked to borrow money we ended up arguing about it but then 2 weeks later he still asked me again. I explained that I would rather we go halves on holidays/meals etc, rather than him splashing his whole paycheck on luxuries then needing to borrow money. The above issues, I can see past, because I want a future with him and I see so many other amazing qualities in him. However, one thing that I have not been able to bring myself to discuss with him is his personal hygiene. He does not brush his teeth- at least not properly. I have watched him go to bed without brushing them and then getting up in the morning, having a cigarette and a coffee, then expecting me to snog him before he goes to work. It’s off putting, but if only he could realise these things are important on his own and sort them out, it would make things so much more pleasurable and easier. The other issue is that he does not shower everyday. He only showers after football or when he has been working a long shift. And even then, he is not cleaning himself properly. When we start to get intimate, it smells *down there* of “toilet-related things” and it’s put me off so bad that I don’t feel like getting affectionate as much anymore. It’s not just the fact it grosses me out but the fact that a 34-year-old man does not know about these things and is not making the effort for me. Since being in a relationship I have showered every single day, I always make sure my breath is fresh, and I’m always clean-shaven/moisturised. Not a day has gone by that my hair is greasy or I am hairy, because I feel it wouldn’t be as pleasurable for him, so why does he not put the same effort in for me? He is currently wanting to break up with me because he says I have been too distant and I am not as affectionate as I was in the beginning. The problem is is that I miss being affectionate with him, and I do want to be affectionate, but I have just never been able to bring myself to have those conversations with him regarding his personal hygiene. In his eyes it’s all because of my job and that I’m not interested in him anymore, and all my energy is just going into my work. This is simply not the case. How do I explain that his personal hygiene is part of the reason for my lack of affection? I don’t want to hurt his feelings.

I don't eat a ton of sugar/junk and I take a decent amount of steps a day as I have an active job. I drink half a cup of coffee in the morning with a little bit of creamer and otherwise only water through the day. No juice or sodas ever. 

Please help I'm feeling so discouraged ",0,1729434557.0,Zepbound,6,0.25,False

I’ve previously used HD-595 that I bought years ago, but I hardly use them and I’m thinking of upgrading. Right now I just use AirPod pros. 

I’m looking at the EM-U teak because they are closed back and I could probably listen to them in public without feeling weird. I hear they have really good bass which might sound awesome when I listen to bass heavy music but it’s not my main. I listen to all kinds of music, lots of indie, but sometimes EDM, hip hip, but also Björk, Aphex Twin, Sufjan Stevens, Charlie xcx, but I don’t want to be disappointed with the bass response or feel like I spent 500 dollars for a slight upgrade to the headphones I’ve already listened to. 

Would this be a good choice, or are there better options for me in this price range? I don’t need closed back but I’d also love to take these to the coffee shop without being rude.

I would have my coffee with a shot or two of bourbon in it and then I would generally fix a few more drinks before noon for my wife came home from church. She always knew though that I was drinking cuz I was slurring my speech and acting silly. When she left this morning all those memories flooded back and I started thinking this is not going to be worth it so I am not drinking today. I found other things to occupy my time and it has kept my mind occupied so I'm not thinking about drinking. Even that's only been 20 days since I stopped drinking for sober October most of my issues are not coming from alcohol cravings for coming from set habits and a psychological need for it. Thank you guys for always being so supportive and I appreciate everything you all have done for me. Today is going to be just a day of fellowship and football.

Last night he came to bed pretty late almost 1130pm (he had a friend over) I know he wanted to have sex but I just wasn't feeling it.

I cuddle up on him and I fell asleep pretty fast laster on around 2am I woke up cause my arm was sore from laying on ot so I move, and he wakes up too and in a really bad mood talking under his breath, sighing loudly, touching me like a tickle on the neck but  aggressively.

like you know like his trying to show his really annoyed.

This goes on for quite awhile so he then says are we okay I don't seem like we are ok he said he was pissed cause he wanted to cuddle all day and he was trying to give me kisses and hugs throughout the day ect shit like that.

i'm like we good I just want to sleep so  mind you I gave him attention today and I fell asleep cuddling him, we just didn't have sex.

so i put my headphones on to ignore him but my anxiety was so bad at that point it took me a really long time to fall asleep.

this morning he woke me up with a kiss and him and his friend are going to get coffee. He came back gave me a coffee and kiss said he didn't sleep at all last night.

Note: I usually feel pressured into having sex everyday because if we don't he gets chanky.

We been together almost 3 years now and the attitude he gives me when he doesn't get what he wants is starting to really get to me, I feel like I'm constantly walking on egg shells.

How do I tell him this is starting to become an issue and he needs to stop it?",3,1729433673.0,emotionalabuse,1,0.81,False

for context, i’m male, 23 and live in the uk. without tooting my own horn too much, i’m reasonably attractive, i have a decent job at a company i’m passionate about and i have an interesting hobby. i keep myself pretty busy with work, seeing friends and my hobby. i do like going on dates and flirting, it’s fun and i like to build connections.

recently i had a date planned with a lovely girl called tara, and then she cancelled at lunchtime on the day it was meant to be, it was annoying but it seemed like a genuine calendar mix-up and she was profusely apologetic. no-harm, no-foul. then on the rescheduled date she let me know a few hours before that she had her friends ‘leaving-do’ before they went travelling and so she’d have to leave at around 8:30-9. considering this was a mid-week date that would start at 6pm, i thought this was a little rude. i politely told her how i felt and said i’d just rather we rescheduled than have her clock watching throughout. when we finally did go on the date, it was nice - she was lovely, we had good chemistry and we went on several more dates. 

i did end up breaking it off because i didn’t feel that little spark of excitement that you’re meant to feel at the start of something new and i’m too young to settle for anything less than something that makes my heart ache with joy. 


about a week later i matched with another girl, coincidentally also called tara so let’s call her tara g, she’s very pretty and we seemed to get a long very well. i asked if she’d like to go out friday just gone, she said yes - but caveated that she was going out for a big work conference on the thursday and might not be on top form. predictably on the friday, she cancelled citing her raging hangover - i saw it coming and was disappointed but oh well. i rearranged and asked her for coffee today at 1pm which she excitedly accepted and she made a little joke about how she was writing it in her diary with permanent marker, and might even tattoo it. this morning she told me that she was looking after her niece and if we could push it back an hour, of course not a problem. at about 1 she texted me to say that her brother was being difficult and that she didnt think it was going to happen.

what’s annoying is that all 4 excuses seem incredibly genuine and reasonable- but i just can’t help doubting that either i’m being lead on, made to look like a dick, or being unfair to them with genuine and unfortunate clashes. 

so my question is this: is there some new dating advice/trend of women to cancel a date twice to make sure you are / keep you keen? am i being a nob to be frustrated about it? should i be less empathetic?

ps. if you’ve read this far and have looked at my account and noticed my account is NSFW - i’d like to make a disclaimer that whilst i do have a kinky side - i am not a creep on dating apps or irl, only in appropriate situations(such as NSFW subreddits)",1,1729433504.0,dating,3,1.0,False
