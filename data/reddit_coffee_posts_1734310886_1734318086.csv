Please bear with me and if anyone could take the time to read what happened and let me know their thoughts that would be great. 

I have a Subaru Crosstrek Premium 2024. Two weeks ago, I found (3) mouse droppings in my cup holder/ around the center console. (I keep no food in the car, only had an iced coffee in there). Brought it to Subaru and there were 0 signs of mice nesting after thorough inspection. Today, found more droppings (7 ish pieces) - checked engine and spare tire compartment and glove box- no other signs. I’ve had peppermint oil in my car ever since finding droppings two weeks ago. I park my car in a garage. 

I decided to try spray bottle spraying some peppermint oil DILUTED WITH WATER under the hood, but then realized that this might be dangerous to the engine components and spray bottle sprayed some plain water under there to try to wash the peppermint solution off. I admittedly wasn’t thinking and was just so anxious about getting this solved and didn’t realize that this may not be smart until after. Now I’m panicking that I made a mistake by getting under the hood wet. Can someone please help me answer these?

1- why is the mouse coming in, pooping, and not nesting? What is going on here?

2- is the small amount of water that I spray / misted under the hood going to hurt the car?

3- is peppermint oil DILUTED heavily okay to spray under the hood after all?

4- what else should I do? I’m so freaked out about having damage done to my car. I have the peppermint baggies under my seats and I added some moth balls to the spare tire well. I never have food in my car except bagged groceries which I take inside right away.

He knows I have an eating disorder, it’s obvious and I was open about it early in our relationship. He’s always been supportive of me though. Helping me stick to my meal plan, encouraging to go to my appointments, and to eat more in a way that doesn’t piss me off. He’s great 

A lot of people don’t know but there are two types of anorexia, anorexia-r(restrictive) and anorexia-bp(binge purge.) both types are restrictive disorders except with mine an-bp, I also binge and purge(throw up, in my case.) 

I’ve always been very secretive about this aspect of my disorder as it’s the most emotionally exhausting and embarrassing part of it to me. I will buy food and eat it in the car, or eat while my bf isn’t home and then hide the trash or take it to a dumpster somewhere else. 

CW this next part is so gross I’m so sorry 

>!I normally purge into the toilet but lately I’ve been doing it so much I’m afraid I’ll clog the pipes. So I’ve been purging into gallon ziplock bags then triple bagging them in trash bags before taking them to the bin outside!<

I’m almost 100% certain my bf found one of the bags. He was trying to fit a broken coffee maker into the outside bin and he was out there for so long. I had forgotten that I’d put a bag in early today, so I just stupidly let him go out there. I should have took the coffee maker out myself, I really messed up. 

When he came back inside he was really quiet, he went to the bathroom and even when he came back out he was kind of standoffish. I acted like nothing was abnormal and now he’s playing video games in his office and I’m panicking in the living room.

I’m so disgusted with my behaviour. He wouldn’t even look at me. I can only imagine what he’s thinking. Helping someone with not eating enough is wildly different than finding your partners bag of vomit, fuck I’m such an idiot ",1,1734317886.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I’m a 21-year-old guy living in the Tri-county area, and I’m on the lookout for a close friend or group of friends to share life with. I thrive on meaningful connections and would love to meet someone who enjoys spending time together and really getting to know one another.

About me: I’m precocious, with a deep passion for music, both creating and enjoying it. I love cooking, checking out classic cars, spending time at parks, going to jazz bars, and heading to the beach at night to relax and reflect. I’m also into yoga, working out, and traveling whenever I can.

If you’re someone who values deep conversations, loves exploring the city, or just enjoys low-key hangouts like coffee or a beach walk, let’s connect! Feel free to message or comment—I’d love to hear from you.",1,1734317774.0,fortlauderdale,1,1.0,False

If I share some of my interests, could someone tell me which seems the “best” for me? I’m suuuuuper overwhelmed by all of the opinions and information so I’d rather someone be brutally honest and just pick a place for me to narrow it down lol. And tell me why! 

26F, love going on walks, Pilates/yoga/workout classes, matcha/coffee shops. I work fully remote and would also like to get a dog when I move here! 

Looking to make girl friends and go on dates with 26-33M (give or take on the age range). I want the area to have cute coffee shops, walking distance to a gym or workout classes, and “aesthetic” (I’m prepared to be judged for that one). Walking distance grocery store a plus. Also want it to be safe but these 4 choices all seem safe. I have a car but would leave it behind if I could walk most places listed. 

Budget I would say is studio or 1BR under 2k (in an ideal world would be around 1700-1800 but I’m flexible and want to be happy with where I choose so I don’t want price to factor too much).

For the last 5 years, I've been using the [5cup Zojirushi](https://www.target.com/p/zojirushi-zutto-5-cup-coffee-maker-silver/-/A-79992499?sid=&ref=tgt_adv_xsp&AFID=google&fndsrc=tgtao&DFA=71700000012576704&CPNG=PLA_Appliances%2BShopping%7CAppliances_Ecomm_Home&adgroup=SC_Appliances_Coffee+Makers+%26+Accessories&LID=700000001170770pgs&LNM=PRODUCT_GROUP&network=g&device=c&location=9019676&targetid=pla-1439047010324&ds_rl=1246978&ds_rl=1247068&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmfq6BhAsEiwAX1jsZx4TCcDsPbaY4X6z_fx8HYQ7Rio1VN9gTdJUpfzDO3u86CVlTDN0TRoCl4sQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), and I've enjoyed it. I have about 15 fluid ounces of coffee first thing in the morning, and that's it for the day.

When the Moccamasters were on sale, I wanted to get one as a gift to myself. Since I only have \~15 fluid ounces, I knew the one-cup would be too little, but the regular KBVG would make more than I need. That's why I settled on the KBTS because it seemed like a middle ground and closer to me using it and not wasting so much extra capacity.

Now, I'm second-guessing my purchase. Since I like to make my coffee machine to run while I feed the dog and then have the coffee right after, I don't keep the coffee sitting around long before I drink it so the negative of the hot plate burning the coffee I don't think is very applicable to me. I only realized after the sale ended and before I unboxed the KBTS, that the KBTS doesn't have a hot plate. After reading, I learned I should heat up the thermal carafe before I use it. This will take extra time in the morning.

Additionally, the Zojirushi is easy to clean, and I'd think the KBVG is similarly easy to clean. 

Can anyone share thoughts on my purchase given how I like to make/drink coffee? Was the KBTS instead of a KBVG a mistake?",1,1734317673.0,Moccamaster,1,1.0,False

Hello! This story is kind of a long one so buckle in. 
   And hi Charlotte! If you ever happen to read this, I love watching your videos. Coming from a fellow people pleaser as this story will show, you remind me a lot of myself and I love that you’ve come so far from trying to let go of that. That’s something I need to get better at but it easier said than done. Congratulations on your engagement. You both look so cute together. 

Back to the story… It put me through a lot of stress at the time and made me sick to my stomach while it was going on but I’ve moved passed it now and am in a much better place

    So… I live in Hawaii now and it can be really hard to find a place to live over here. Moved here to be closer to family after Covid and not seeing them for a couple years as a result. Well after living with family for a few months and having to share a room with my sister, I was losing my mind. She’s not the crazy roommate, but I knew I needed to get my own place. 
    Well I met this girl when I was out one day… we’ll call her Ashley. This is while I was still living with family. She seemed alright, we became friends for a time. Hung out a couple of times both just the two of us and in a few group settings. In hindsight, a lot of people kind of warned me that she seemed off in some aspects but I try to see the best in people and be a decent person and I hadn’t had any problems with her at that point.
    She was needing a place too at the time and I was offered a place by a family friend to move into pretty quickly. Keep in mind there are a lot of rundown places out here, especially in the more jungle like areas of the island and I moved into a shack version of a shack on a coffee farm. It was worked on by hand and probably wouldn’t have passed any codes if inspected. She moved in with me and we were there for a few months. She was going through some personal drama that I won’t get into because that’s not my place, but I gave her a lot of passes for her behavior and mental state and was an ear to her problems a lot. 
     After a few months in the shack, which wasn’t necessarily the easiest or most comfortable living conditions, an opportunity to move into another much nicer place closer to the main town over here came up. Closer to my family who live just up the hill from me now and much closer to work instead of making the long drives in the morning and evenings. It’s a house that’s split between the upstairs and downstairs which is what I was moving into. The downstairs is a ONE BEDROOM. Now, because her and I were friends and I knew she wouldn’t feel comfortable living with strangers, especially men she might not know (the shack we were in was rented out on a room basis with 3 rooms there but we paid extra so it would just be the two of us), I offered to let her move with me to the new place. BIG MISTAKE. At first we agreed and talked about how we would manage the living arrangement. I would take the bedroom and she would live in the living room with dividers that we planned to get to separate the space (the living area is pretty big and there was plenty of space to do this). I told her I could probably help get the dividers and I knew I’d be paying more for taking the bedroom. We talked about how the cost would be split. I would be paying 2/3 of the rent and we’d split the utilities. She came back later on and told me, she only wanted to pay a set amount every month which would have been 1/3 of the rent and none of the utilities because she didn’t have her own room. Fine, I didn’t want to argue on the matter. Whatever. 
    Eventually it was about time for us to move out and she said an opportunity came up for her to dog/house sit for a few months and asked if I would be okay if she didn’t move in with me after all. I told her, sure, that was fine. I figured then with it being just me, I wanted to order some things to make the new place more homely. I ordered some bookshelves, a tv stand to put the tv in the living room. Some things to fill in the space more so it wouldn’t feel so empty being just me. It was money I spent on things because I didn’t think she was going to move in with me after all.
    She ended up moving out of the original spot earlier than I did to start house sitting and it immediately fell through so she asked me if she could still live with me after all. I told her sure, but I spent money on other things thinking she wasn’t going to be joining me and I couldn’t afford to get the dividers. She moved in with me anyways and this begins my month of hell.
    My landlord was sweet and offered us some of the things in the house that were already in it. A small twin sized bed because Ashley didn’t have a bed and slept on my futon at the other house. A small desk and tiny dresser that were already here. Sheets and blankets for her to use. She barely owned anything and most of the things in the house were mine. 
   Right after we moved in, she quit her job and decided to work small side gigs instead like cleaning some of the local air B&Bs. And she met up with guys who would pay her to hang out with them. We didn’t have dividers, she lived in the open living room and me, feeling bad, spent most of my time in my bedroom so that she could have her privacy.  The bathroom has two doors, one to the main living area and a second sliding door to my bedroom. We also have a decent backyard and I have a door in the bedroom that leads to the backyard so I would use that a lot in the mornings to leave for work. Her mood changes at the new place got worse and worse and soon I found myself constantly walking on eggshells. Uncomfortable spending any time in the house besides my bedroom. She took up gardening in the backyard so it felt like she took that over too and I was basically paying a bunch of money to have a bedroom while she had the whole rest of the house and backyard and I was paying the utilities while I was gone at work a lot and she would spend all day at the house. Eventually she would have a guy that would come over for… you know, and I couldn’t even leave my bedroom to do so much as make coffee for myself. She’d make it and leave it for me in the bathroom. He came in late at night and wouldn’t even leave until like noon. Honestly, I was going stir crazy and grew to hate the living situation. I didn’t trust talking to her unless she spoke to me first because I wasn’t sure what mood she would be in. And eventually she began throwing the dividers in my face, holding it over my head. Like, you need to get this! You said you were going to get it! Which was something I said I could help with before I spent money on other things and before she had said she only wanted to pay a certain amount and none of the utilities basically. I didn’t have the money. But she kept pushing and pushing and I was over it. I was looking at dividers on Amazon trying to find good ones after one particularly pushy day from her. Saved some for ideas (they were not cheap by any means) and wanted to get her input before I ordered it. Well I got home that day using the back door to enter my bedroom and had to go into the kitchen for something. Wasn’t sure what mood she was in so I wasn’t going to say anything. She said hi to me though so I thought it was okay and stupidly approached her with my phone to show her some of the dividers I found. She paused for a moment and then helped me measure the area and we picked it out and I ordered it on my credit card. I thought the issue would be resolved and things would mellow out and get better now that that was ordered and set to come. How WRONG I was. I was keeping to myself in my bedroom later that same night when she began to BLOW UP on me! 
    Like how dare I approach and talk to her. She didn’t want to talk to me. I should have texted her if I needed to talk to her about something. (I wasn’t even going to say anything but thought it would be okay to talk about it when she said hi to me and messaged me earlier that day holding over my head the fact that I said I’d get the dividers so I’m probably an idiot for that) She doesn’t have to talk to me all the time. Oh, I’m so controlling or pushing her boundaries because I entered her space which was not okay. She didn’t like that my stuff was in the living area and couldn’t deal with hoarder energy (this wasn’t the case. Sure  some of my things were there like the futon and the  2 bookshelves with knickknacks and a smaller bookshelf with my records and record player lined up on the wall but I was just trying to make a nice comfortable living area that I already felt like I couldn’t spend time in. And everything in the kitchen was mine) and more of my things needed to go into my bedroom. She was in her self care era and how I needed to respect that. She said I was a liar or not true to my word because I bought other things instead of the dividers like I said I would and my word basically means nothing. According to her, I owed her… despite her eating my food, using up and taking some of my expensive products and makeup and my essential oils and my cleaning supplies, etc.
    She ALSO said she WOULD NOT be paying rent until the dividers came and that did floor me a bit. We had been there almost a month at this point, rent was due in a few days and the dividers would not arrive for like two weeks. I had just put a couple hundred dollars towards the divider to get a large one with a curtain. I could only manage to get one at the time and she talked her friend into helping her get the other one, but it was still a lot of money. Financials were a bit tight but I could manage. She also refused to pay rent until she was put on the lease… now my landlord did not want to put her on the lease after she decided she wasn’t going to move in with me and then suddenly she was. So I knew that wasn’t going to happen. She was kind of written on the lease on the side with her info as being kind of a sub tenant to me. And I was already so over it and sick to my stomach and uncomfortable with the whole living situation. There was some back and forth, but eventually I said something along the lines of, “this doesn’t appear to be working out. I’ve tried to help you and nothing I do is good enough. Going to cancel the dividers. Rent is due soon, either help or I don’t want you around anymore” (I’ll see if I can add some of the message screen texts. It gets pretty bad). This was my last message to her. She kept blowing up my phone with some of the worst messages she could think of to hurt me but I never responded again. I ABSOLUTELY canceled the order for the divider… Because I’m true to my word.
    Eventually she agreed to move out but told me she would be out by a certain date and I was not allowed back into my home until she was gone because she didn’t want to see my face. Made a bunch of rude insults to me, talked about how she suddenly has a great opportunity coming up that she would have had if I weren’t so awful. How she’s moving onto better things and I made her life better. I was receiving all of this at work and couldn’t focus. Was sick to my stomach about things going on at the house. Even went to the police station to find out what my options were. Didn’t really have many at the time. My landlord though was made aware of the situation and how she was talking about how she was about to have a free place to live. Told me I absolutely had to go home because she was worried she would try to push me out of my house and squat there. I needed to anyways because she turned out to be a kleptomaniac and I didn’t trust her not to rob me or run up my bills out of spite. Landlord said if she had anyone over that night, to let her know and her and my dad and my stepmom (who she’s friends with) would come down to the house with chairs and drinks. I went straight home after work and went in through my bedroom door and stayed there for a bit.
   Well! She did have a friend of hers over that night. I knew the guy was harmless and poor guy had a thing for her which she used to her advantage to get things from him, but I told them regardless and down to the house they did in fact come. Her and her friend were at the picnic bench in the backyard and we set up with chairs and a cooler just a few feet away chatting casually paying them no mind. You could tell they were uncomfortable and eventually they went inside, closed all the curtains and you could hear some rustling around. She packed and left THAT NIGHT. I took the next day off from work and did not leave until the day hit a couple days later that she said she would be out of the house by and changed those locks! Figured that way I wouldn’t get into legal trouble in case she tried to enter the premises before then because she was technically a tenant and probably would have had rights up to her move out date.
   I still live here. The energy has definitely shifted and I’m much happier without the toxicity she brought into my life. There are some things I’ve noticed that she stole from me, but it could have been worse and I don’t have to deal with her anymore.

Sorry it’s so long. I tried to give context and the whole situation was a lot. AITA? Is there another way I could have handled it? The situation does sometimes still make me sick when I think about it. Was I in the wrong where the dividers were concerned? Wish I listened when others said they had a bad vibe from her but it happened and it’s over. Can only take the lesson learned and move on. Hopefully my case can help someone else not have to learn that lesson first hand.


Note: I have a cat but absolutely can’t have dogs on property. She brought a dog over to dog sit and had a makeshift leash sitting in the backyard. When my landlord asked about it because she comes by to maintain the property, she caught Ashley in a lie claiming it was for my cat who is a completely indoor cat. She also lit the flower a lot on the back patio and the backyard frequently smelled of it which my landlord also didn’t like but people are pretty lax on that here in Hawaii.",1,1734317442.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,0.67,False

It's been my dream to try paw paw one day, especially because I love foraging and always see it in the foraging subreddit, but it's never been a realistic goal since grocery stores don't sell the fruit and I live in Canada (outside of the plant's growing range only the very tip of Ontario is habitable by the plant).

Today at the Christmas market, to my shock, a fruit and vegtable vendor was selling paw paws shipped from a farm down south. They sold small fruit boxes for 15$ (has like 4 fruit inside each box). I was telling my wife how I have always wanted to try and she said I should buy it, however, I was leaning to no because almost all the  fruit had gone soft and black, we are broke so we shouldn't drop 15$ on a container of fruit with a maximum one paw paw that's still good.

The vendor overheard my dilemma and my excitement to even see the fruit and he slipped me one of the still green paw paws and said ""Its okay, just take it, happy holidays"" I tried to offer paying part price or buying him a coffee or treat but he was insistant and said he just wanted to make someone's day.

I figured I’d post an update. 


I am still incredibly depressed. All the good things coming from this experience are overshadowed by my grief and mourning of a job I live and bitterness to my old managers. 


I wound up failing my pediatric final. I needed 80% to pass the class, and I bombed the final so badly I wound up with 79.5%  in the class. Before the final I was making an 86 or 87… the final happened after while I was so focused on this event. 

I am now having to retake that course, which is putting me an entire semester behind graduation. So now instead of being finished in May, I’ll graduate in December. 

Coincidentally that’s when my ineligibility for rehire expires. This area is owned by a healthcare monopoly. I want to work in a hospital ER upon graduation, but now I’m leaning toward a smaller hospital because I refuse to work under than management. 

I also sent in an appeal. I am pretty sure it goes to my old management so it won’t be upheld. However, I’m sending it over their heads after. 



Since we are majorly under a monopoly, that leaves my only current option being a longterm care facility. I had the job lined up before I resigned and had them reject my resignation and fire me. The DON knew this was a ‘maybe’ job for me. She and I knew one another and she knew I’d work hard and any hours available. I didn’t apply anywhere else because part of me still thinks I’ll wake up tomorrow and be going to my old job. 

Today was my very first day… let me tell you… holy shit I commend all of you: nurses, techs, social workers, etc., who’ve worked in longterm care. 

Today was day one and I have never been so BEAT in my life. I have never seen people work so damn hard. I went from feeding my last feeder’s breakfast to the first feeder’s lunch like it was nothing. Not to mention the changing, lack of help turning totals, etc., in every second that could’ve been a break but wound up being prioritizing these people who live in this facility. The beds were all different, and they didn’t have the same medical clean holds I’m used to. I don’t think I did a thing medical. The techs here don’t even do vitals. 

To the nurse, who worked as a tech today, who left during her own lunch to buy a resident her favorite coffee creamer… and to the tech who oriented me today, who loved and kissed a lady on the cheek every time she saw her…

Thank god for people like you. 

The members of this staff are outstanding people who care so much for these residents— I keep wanting to say patients. You can feel they love them like their family. 


I don’t know that I’ll stay in longterm care. It’s never been my plan. I didn’t think I’d ever work in one once I graduate. I believe this will be a good thing for my resume and a different thing to learn in the time I’m extending my school experience. I’ll still treat these precious people with all the love and care that is at my (idealist) idea of nursing. 

Screw the management who won’t speak up or defend their staff, who won’t hear a thing that doesn’t follow their agenda. 


Also, I talked to my dean. I was SO impressed by her. 
I told her the situation, even bringing up my barely failing score for the one class. 

I have been thinking for a minute, that having one class in the spring while adjusting to this brand new job is a blessing. I didn’t once ask her to change the grade or round up… because I’m so overwhelmed, I don’t think I’d be successful moving on with double my school load and a new job. 

I told her what had happened and let me tell you— I have never felt so supported by someone. Not only has nobody contacted her, but my dean barely even mentioned that incident once I explained it, told me if they DO contact her, they would be reaching out to ME before even responding, and she empathized with my situation. 

My doubts and fears subsided so much when she and I talked. I wept in my car after because  this was marking of the end of this horrible event…

… so now I can put it behind me. 

Send me the best vibes as I try to make it in longterm care. I want to do my best by these people and to show the people working how damn important they are. ",5,1734317006.0,nursing,0,0.86,False

I'll be traveling (solo) for about a week, from 1/14 - 1/22. Definitely a bucket list trip! I'm immersing myself in learning as much as I can about Hawaii (currently reading Michener's *Hawaii)*, and am very open to trying new things.

Some thoughts:

* With the exception of a few traditional tourist things (Pearl Harbor, Dole Plantation, a luau, etc.), I'd like to experience the islands as authentically as possible, eat where the locals eat, do what the locals do. But I am open to some other touristy things too (whale watching, shark cages, sky diving)
* I love experiencing local cuisine. Very excited about the fruit, seafood, coffee, etc
* I'm also all about small, local businesses, especially those with history or stories behind them
* I'm equally excited about off-the-beaten-path places no one usually goes to as I am historic sites and epic views
* I'm flying in and out of Honolulu. Other than that, where I go, what I see, where I stay, and how to get there is still all up in the air
* I'm training for a marathon in March. I'm thinking it would be awesome to do one of my long runs (\~13 - 15 miles) while I'm there, preferably on flat terrain 
* If I understand correctly, Hawaii is very friendly, but the gay scene isn't what you'd find in other major areas in terms of bars, clubs, bath houses, dark rooms, etc. 
* Still, I'd like to let my hair down a bit. . nude beaches, gay lodgings, whatever else there is. . .

  
So where should I go? What should I see, do, eat, etc.? Where should I stay and how do I get everywhere?

1hf94la,https://i.redd.it/69rwi2ifh47e1.png,"Monday, December 16, 2024 | Word of The Day ""Hey, hold on a second!"" - Have you ever experienced those moments that just make you stop and think? • [Click to Expand] ","# Pause and Reflect: The Profound Art of Momentary Awareness


Have you ever been in the middle of your usual routine—rushing to catch a train, scrolling mindlessly through your phone, or mechanically completing a work task—when suddenly, something shifts? A split second where the world seems to pause, and you're struck by an unexpected wave of awareness. That's the moment I want to explore: those brief, extraordinary instances that interrupt our autopilot and invite us to truly see.

These moments are like unexpected philosophical nudges, tiny interruptions in our carefully constructed narratives that demand we stop, breathe, and actually acknowledge our existence. They're not grand, dramatic revelations but subtle whispers that slip through the cracks of our daily consciousness. Think about it: you might be waiting in line at a coffee shop, and suddenly, the way sunlight catches the steam rising from someone's latte makes you acutely aware of the intricate beauty surrounding you.

What triggers these moments? Sometimes it's something seemingly insignificant—a bird landing on a windowsill, an overheard snippet of conversation, or the rhythm of raindrops against a window. Other times, it's more profound: a sudden realization of your own mortality, a brief connection with a stranger, or witnessing an act of unexpected kindness.

Philosophers have long been fascinated by these interruptions. They're not just random occurrences but potential gateways to deeper understanding. Henri Bergson, the French philosopher, talked about ""durée"" or pure duration—those moments when time feels different, when we're not just measuring seconds but experiencing them in their raw, unfiltered state. It's like time stretches and contracts, revealing layers of experience typically hidden beneath our routine perceptions.

Consider the last time you truly paused. Not just a physical pause, but a genuine moment of presence. Maybe it was during a walk when you suddenly noticed the intricate patterns of a leaf, or during a conversation when you realized the profound complexity of human connection. These moments are invitations—subtle calls to step outside our habitual thinking and engage with the world more authentically.

Interestingly, these philosophical interruptions often occur when we least expect them. They're not confined to meditation retreats or philosophical seminars but can ambush us in the most mundane settings. A crowded subway, a busy street corner, or your own living room can suddenly become a stage for profound realization. It's as if the universe has a sense of humor, choosing the most unexpected moments to nudge our consciousness.

But why are these moments so powerful? They function like reset buttons for our perception. In a world that constantly demands our attention—bombarding us with notifications, expectations, and endless to-do lists—these interruptions remind us that there's more to existence than productivity and achievement. They invite introspection, challenging us to question our assumptions and reconnect with a more authentic version of ourselves.

Psychologically, these moments are fascinating. They represent brief windows where our default mode network—the part of our brain responsible for mind-wandering and self-referential thinking—gets temporarily disrupted. Suddenly, we're not just thinking about ourselves in relation to past or future, but experiencing the pure, unfiltered now. Neuroscientists might describe this as a momentary state of heightened awareness, where our typical narrative-driven consciousness takes a backseat.

Think about children—they're masters at experiencing these moments naturally. A child can spend hours fascinated by a ladybug, completely absorbed in the present. As adults, we've trained ourselves to constantly analyze, categorize, and move on. These philosophical interruptions are essentially invitations to reclaim that childlike sense of wonder, to see the world with fresh, unencumbered eyes.

Cultural traditions have long recognized the value of such moments. Zen Buddhism, for instance, emphasizes mindfulness and being present—concepts that resonate deeply with these spontaneous philosophical interruptions. Meditation practices across various traditions are essentially structured attempts to create space for these very experiences that occasionally visit us unbidden.

The beauty of these moments lies in their unpredictability and brevity. They don't require grand gestures or elaborate setups. They're democratic in nature—available to anyone willing to be slightly more attentive, slightly more open to the subtle rhythms of existence. They remind us that philosophy isn't just an academic exercise confined to textbooks, but a living, breathing engagement with our immediate experience.

So the next time you feel that sudden pause, that unexpected interruption in your routine—don't dismiss it. Don't rush past it. Instead, pause. Breathe. Let yourself be curious. These moments are gifts, tiny portals offering glimpses into a more profound way of experiencing the world. They're invitations to step out of our narratives and into something more expansive, more alive.

In a world that constantly pulls us outward, these philosophical interruptions are gentle reminders to look inward, to marvel, to wonder. They whisper: ""Hey, hold on a second. There's more here than meets the eye.""

1hf8ye7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hf8ye7/using_time_correctly_diagnosing_adhd_ect/,"Using time correctly, diagnosing ADHD, ect.","Hey guys, I'm (29M) having a genuinely hard problem with sitting down to start and work on a big project. Whenever I have time to do it, I always end up opting out and doing many tasks around the house instead. This gives me a general sense of fulfillment however I always have a looming bigger task that seems to just coast by the wayside instead of being worked on. I was always severely nervous or distrusting when it came to any medication that had to do with focusing due to people around me getting hooked on them. I started eating healthier, I stopped drinking every day, I go to the gym, I pretty much am trying to get to as barebones as possible so I can try and figure out what my body actually needs. Aside from a drink here and there, or smoking pot at night to get some sleep, I have genuinely progressed with my health these last 6 months and I am proud of that. Now that I have gotten to a point that I am close to considering that it is a chemical issue, I keep wondering if there is something else I am missing or something I do not know about that would be able to help me instead of getting a prescription that would end up me possibly leaning into it once I realize it is helping.

Some context, maybe this will help:  
My dad was always a very heavy drinker, I am addicted to caffeine (just coffee unless its a late night and I need a red bull), cigs, and since I stopped drinking it has been sugar later on into the night.

I am a standup comedian who in my personal opinion has been doing well in his local scene. I am not a headliner by any means however my peers do consistently and positively bring up my work ethic for the craft. I do not enjoy much of the positive feedback I receive because I know how much time I genuinely waste instead of sitting down nose to the grindstone and writing (big project I have going on right now is I want to begin writing a low budget movie I would LOVE to figure out how to make.)

It has gotten to the point where I obsess over the time I waste, to the point where I end up trying to count how many minutes I wasted today. I am actively thinking right now about me wasting time writing this in the event that it goes nowhere instead of writing which I probably would put off doing other things anyway.

I guess my ultimate questions are:  
Does anyone or has anyone faced this and came up with some answers on how to fix their attention issues?  
At what point is my fascination with wanting to be obsessed at all time about writing unhealthy BOTH before I figure out how to do it all the time AND while I'm just bullying myself into not doing anything at all?

I take it to heart when I see people in my field work harder than me and I would like nothing more than to figure out how to just work without being so easily distracted or willing to do smaller tasks with immediate gratification.

I do really try to work my ass off, every day or night I have off I do whatever possible to put into my want of being a working comic. This is the road I want to go down regardless of if I become rich or famous, I just want to be the best I can be and make people laugh. The rest will come. I am in no rush and have no intention on pissing away the years of me learning and coming up. I did that in my 20s, I do not regret it, but I want to figure out how to get my head right so I can work on the things I want to work on.

Thank you. I am keenly aware that this career choice, that people have way bigger problems, and that on this page this is not of as much importance as some of the stories people post. I hope to find somewhat of a lead to guide me in possibly figuring this all out. Thanks guys, I hope you have an awesome holiday.",1,1734315969.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I’m new to my job as a bar and restaurant manager and he’s upset he didn’t get the job so he’s been targeting me and trying to get me in trouble/fired. 

A little back story, I just got promoted maybe 2 months ago and am currently on probation (for the first 90 days of the job). I have been at my current company for 2 years and have worked my way up by busting my a55 and putting in the work. I’m a 23 F and my supervisor who is giving me the trouble is a 53M. Both previous managers have also faced issues with him but nothing this bad and nothing came of it since they “did not have the time to deal with it”. 

A few examples of things he has done within the past 2 months of me being promoted:

Sexually harassing 2 female employees 
Lied about his whereabouts while on shift 
Found asleep on the job 
Urinated in a coffee cup in our liquor storage room (and yes he left it there) 
Has been suspected to come into work drunk 
Created a hostile work environment (has been that way for months now) 
Has displayed sexist and ageist many risks and made comments as such 



It’s gotten to the point where everyone hate coming into work with him since they know it’s going to be a crappy shift where he rules with an iron fist and flaunts his power. All these issues have arose recently with me since I no longer allow him to get away with anything. Oh you’re standing around and intimidating the staff, go stock the liquor cage. Talking on the phone? Start breaking down this well and scrubbing the floors. 

I ended up getting HR involved and there’s a current pending investigation because I came to HR. Ever since then he has been calling out, writing sickening emails and trying to place the blame on me for “stomach issues” and “not wanting to work without me without another manager present” and finally “needing to be on medication to even work with me”. 

I need advice on how to handle this. He’s acting out of malice and I’m desperate to get rid of him, any advice?

My aunt; we'll call her sharon; always pops over unannounced after being told to chill out and stay home since I recently had a baby and am getting the nursing routine down. She thought we were kidding and she ALWAYS barges through the front door when I'm trying to feed my child in the living room. When she sees what I am doing she will automatically make a condescending remark and complain that she doesn't want to see my tits everytime she's over and that I should either go to my bedroom or cover up.. mind you she doesn't live with us. Anyway after she says this she goes to the kitchen and makes herself a pot of coffee and uses a shit ton of creamer. Now I'm not back to work but my husband and mom work but we just scrape by and creamer is one of our indulgence buys. Well one day Sharon asked to hold the baby (who was in his crib sleeping) to feed him a bottle of the breast milk i was currently pumping but she was still getting over a cold so I said ""no because you're sick so absolutely not."" She got SOOOOO offended saying I'm trying to ""hog the baby"" and that I need to share and that how is she supposed to bond with him if he's always with mommy. And that I need to stop being a helicopter mom and get off my high horse. After saying this she stormed off to the kitchen and I heard something go down the drain then heard the trash can lid open. I walked into then kitchen to put my extra breast milk into the glass container in the fridge and seen a empty glass jar on the counter. All the while Sharon has a malicious smirk on her face over her coffee cup so I ask her ""why is there a glass jar there?"" She responds ""well I didn't know how old that milk was (previous days pump) so I dumped it to save you time. Oh and also you're out of creamer"" then she walked off. Now I have a decent amount of fat in my milk and curiosity got the best of me one day so I tasted my milk and it was kinda sweet so that gave me an idea. After she left I went into the garbage can to retrieve the empty creamer container, washed it out and proceeded to use THAT as my new breastmilk container with just a few drops of pure vanilla extract to make it smell like the vanilla creamer we use (dont worry i didnt give it to baby). We got more creamer but I put THAT into pint glass jars with a date on them.

So my mom made a new friend at work who has a son around my age who hasn't made friends since they just moved and she wanted to see if we could be friends when she found out my mom had a kid who's close in age to him. She mentioned a few things he was interested in and I was interested in them too so I said yes to hanging out because nothing wrong with making new friends.

Anyway one day in our local town my mom and her went for a coffee and me and him walked around the place. I suggested the park for a nice walk because it's a place my friends I like to hang out. We had a nice chat about movies and games before he asked me did I wanna kiss him. I said no because 1. I just met him and 2. I have a girlfriend. After this he got angry at me for going on a date with him and not wanting to kiss him and at this point I realised that his mom might have made him think this was a date and not just a hang out. He tried to grab and pull me into a kiss so I struggled against him. I accidentally banged our heads together to avoid the kiss and then pushed him off me and he fell to the ground. I ran a little to an area more crowded and rang my mom to collect me which she did and we went home.

Afterwards at home his mom rang mine and was yelling about me attacking her son when he just wanted to spend time with me. My mom explained what happened (since I told her everything in the car) and this mom says I should have just said no instead of pushing him and she told my mom I need to work on my anger issues. My mom basically told her to piss off and hung up after that so pretty sure their friendship is over. My girlfriend and mom says I did the right thing but some of my friends think I overreacted. So am I the asshole for defending myself?

I ran into a local political party board member I have met before.  She's divorced late 40s I think (I'm 64 so 🤷)  She didn't have time to chat but hugged me when she saw me. Mustn't overthink it, I think that's her personality. 

I spoke a bit with a local attorney I know. She's a widow,  I like her. Taking it as just idle political chat. She's a relatively recent widow after all - also she's a QUITE successful attorney.  Let's say she has a better life alone than most people,  and I'd think has lots of choices otherwise. 

After getting home I got a FB message from a local small business owner, who's an FB friend, generally a political ally. She said she saw me (I don't recall ever meeting in person, so maybe from FB pics?) and didn't have a chance to chat, we should chat at next event.

This time I decided to shoot my shot. I agreed that was a good idea.  Then I said we could grab coffee if she'd like. I don't think my nervousness came through on FB Messenger.

So, there you have it, meeting in the wild.

Thing is, you don't know if someone is interested or just friendly.  And these are people you interact with in the community,  in person or online (not anonymously), and who know people you know.

I cleaned it up, but there’s still a bit of a coffee smell when I open it, so I’m wondering if that caused some internal damage.

The main issue is that whenever I'm doing something that uses a considerable amount of resources, like playing any game or having a bunch of chrome tabs open (<15), the laptop just goes into hibernation by itself after about 20 seconds. it doesn't freeze or lag before it happens, so that's weird. There's no message onscreen before it happens, it's like someone pressed the power button on it.

The first few times it happened, when I logged back in, chrome would sometimes show a ""not enough memory"" message. I think it might be a ram issue or overheating. the cpu hits around 82+°c when it happens, which is pretty hot, and I think it could be causing the system to shut down. it has 8gb of single-channel ram at 1328 mhz, and a 1tb kingston ssd used for storage.

I've included a [speccy snapshot](https://pastebin.com/QvLnqjbz) with all the system details in case anyone wants to check it out. I've got windows 11 home, the motherboard is an asus x515ja, and the power profile is set to asus recommended. hibernation is enabled, and I haven't made any recent changes to the system except for deleting some files and restarting.

Any ideas on what could be causing this and how to fix it? would just cleaning it on the inside maybe make things better? I'd really appreciate any help. I'm willing to remove the metal frame off the back and take pics of it if need be. thanks!",1,1734314466.0,techsupport,1,1.0,False

They have no reason to do that and she needs the medicine
. My dad just had surgery and I’m getting married. I am so overwhelmed. So when I applied back for Starbucks was a few months ago I talked to my manager and she said it would be fine for me to have the weekends off so I could do school and go see my family and everything I had to double check and I told her upfront about my mom because I didn’t want to blindside anybody. She ended up leaving the company. We have new managers now and they’re absolutely amazing but I have to work weekends now and I’m not gonna be able to spend Christmas with my family. I got to see my family this past week because my mom had to have emergency surgery. And my boss was completely understanding about it, but I have to get up at 3:30 in the morning this coming morning so I can go to work at 4:30 and I cannot find it myself to go. I have to. I need the money but at the same time I don’t know if I can get up at 4:30 in the morning every day For 5 to 6 days a week. I wanna go home for Christmas and I can’t. I need a job but I just want one with less hours and they won’t keep me if I ask for less hours because it’s not beneficial for the company so I have Hurd. so I’ve been looking at some family owned coffee shops to work in that will give me around 20 to 30 hours a week that are only open from like 8 to 2 which would be perfect so I won’t have to wake up basically in the middle of the night I’ll get to call my mom in the morning and take care of my puppy I won’t be completely and utterly exhausted when I get home I do want to do nothing but sleep. So basically I’m asking if I should just quit or if I should stay. I have an interview this Friday at a local coffee shop.

Must know the difference between “reply all” and “just reply” (seriously, we need this one).

Able to hold a 10-minute conversation without mentioning ""synergy"" or ""pivoting.""

Can laugh at my jokes (even the bad ones, especially those).

Understanding that my “busy” status on Slack might just be me avoiding work.


🌟 Perks:

I’m a terrible cook, but I'll always have snacks.

Quick to share Netflix recommendations, or at least complain about them.

Will absolutely talk about my latest hobby... for an unhealthy amount of time.

The last time we saw each other was 3 months ago but messaged last about 2 months ago. The break up was weird, no one did anything ‘wrong’ but it was more his side because he has unresolved personal issues which I respected.

I thought spending time to work on each other (as during our relationship we did become codependent) would bring us together again in the future and I also went travelling from March for a few months.

I’m really struggling with the thought that he isn’t the one for me. We have such a strong emotional connection and both want to see how each other are doing and I miss his family a lot etc

But I’ve never had a breakup where someone hasn’t done anything wrong and finding it hard to part ways. I did think after 3 months of not seeing each other I’d dis attached from my feelings but seeing him and catching up yesterday brought it all back and clearly I’m not over my feelings.
 
Logically I know no contact is the only way, but has anyone ever actually been able to be friends (once feelings have shifted). I feel I should just be able to look forward but it really does kill me knowing he won’t be in my life/find someone else that connects with me on that level.

I am very caffeine-sensitive, and caffeine lets me sort of take on extra spoons. I call them “ghost spoons” because they are kind of there, kind of aren’t. I can then run around on “ghost spoons”, but eventually the “ghost spoons” will start to flicker and then disappear like a video game boost item or health. 


For a long time, the only way I could get anything done at all was with my “ghost spoons” from 4-6 cups of coffee a day. Treating my illness has resulted in that dropping to 2. Anyways, just curious if anyone can relate. 

Edit: I want to point out that for me, there can definitely be consequences of these “ghost spoons”! One of the commenters described how basically these ghost spoons, like a predatory loan, can actually take interest. I added that even when they don’t, if they fade, you may find yourself spoonless doing an activity that requires much more spoons.",23,1734314194.0,ChronicIllness,10,1.0,False

1hf89nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1hf89nz/the_smell/,The *smell*,"Baby diaper. *gag*

I was at Costco with my mom the other week - she has membership, I don't, and we frequently go together. For whatever reason, I really like Costco and am friendly with a number of the sample people, even though I usually don't want their samples LOL. 

You're probably thinking I'm going to complain about a parent changing a diaper in the middle of the store. I'm not. The mom was doing everything right. 

On this particular trip, I'd had a few coffee samples (friendly with sample people means they want to give you extra LOL), so I really needed to pee. Costco's restrooms are usually kept up well, so I put my purse in the cart and ran off to relieve my bladder. As I'm doing my thing, I smell this utterly putrid, vomit-inducing stench that filled up the entire space. I was wondering if someone was horrible sick in there, and trying not to puke myself. As I exit the stall, I see it: a mother changing her baby's shit-filled diaper on the changing table. The sink across from the stall I was in would have put me directly beside the offending scene, so I moved to the furthest sink I could. Now, I'm a hand washer. I scrub and scrub for at least 30 seconds and rinse until there's no more bubbles or soapy feel. No matter what. No exceptions. Not even this time. I spent the entire hand washing ritual trying to hold my breath and gagging (very audibly, I might add), which was 100% beyond my control. The mom looked over a few times, and when she saw I was truly in distress, she gave an apologetic look. She did nothing wrong. The baby did nothing wrong. No blame to give other than the awful way our bodies were designed. As soon as my hands were washed and rinsed, I *rushed* out of there as quickly as I could, holding my breath except for when I gagged. Didn't bother with getting towels since that would have taken extra time and the dispensers are by the changing table. Thankfully, Costco has smartly set up the restrooms so that you don't have to open any doors to wither enter or leave, and I was more thankful for that on this trip than any other.

You're probably thinking it ended there, as soon as I got out of the restroom and into fresher air. Oh, how I wish I could say it did. Once I was a few feet from the entrance, I started to breathe again, thinking I was safe (and not having much choice). Nope. The smell was following me. I walked as quickly as I could away from the restroom and back into the main store. *The smell was following me!* I must have had a horrible look on my face, because when I got back to my mom, who was talking with one of the sample ladies we see all the time, she immediately asked what was wrong. I recounted my horror, and ended it with ""and now it's following me and it's stuck in my nose!"" That got both of them laughing as I'm still horrified and periodically gagging from the smell that I *swear* was following me and stuck in my nose. They assured me they didn't smell anything, so at least it wasn't stuck on me, but *that smell haunted me for hours.*

I am (fortunately) free tomorrow but I haven’t been able to sleep all night long and it’s almost morning. Besides taking a nap, what I for some reason (physically/perhaps mentally) can’t do at daytime, what do you do to stay awake or even have some energy?

I mean I drink a lot of coffee but unfortunately caffeine doesn’t really have an effect on me (I just love coffee tbh lol).

What are your secrets/solutions of getting through the day with no sleep? Doing (almost) nothing or perhaps the opposite and go for a walk or something? I’m curious what helps you stay awake and somewhat energetic (as far as that’s possible) when you don’t have to work.

I hope you all will have a good night of sleep or already had one but tips are much appreciated :).

i'm currently planning a tommy-centric fic, crossed w/ subnautica!

the basis of it is SBI(containing phil, techno and wilbur \[c! not cc!\]) take tommy as an intern aboard the aurora for the first time, and as you may know it crashes. wilbur, tecchno and phil are put into a coma due to the three making tommy take the seat and various objects hitting techno phil and wilbur.

tommy wakes up to find a bleeding out techno, and wilbur and phil in a comatose. tommy quickly repeairs the medkit and patches techno up, but the rest of the lot are still in a coma. tommy has to catch and bring food back to the unconcious three while figuring out the planet.  *(cue mental breakdowns)*

uh-oh, tommy starts having glowing green spots on him. that can't possibly be good. he starts to suffer from the kharaa virus, making it harder for him to take care of his family. so, he makes a base in the grassy plateaus, and moves them down there with some oxygen tanks and masks, suits and more. (dont ask me how yet, i dont fully know either). he makes a tube and iv connected to a independent food source and water source, making it so that they can survive even if he cant feed them. the room they're in will be prioritised in case of power outage, and will be the only room that will hold power until tommy can fix it.

as tommy starts to grow more aggressive due to the kharaa virus, he locks the door to the infirmary area. he wrecks the rest of the base, (vending machines and coffee machines being ripped off the wall and thrown) and feels sick. but he still goes out, and starts drawing his anger out on the sea creatures outside of the base. only to find a warper he *(somehow)* manages to take down.

after a few months, tommy's immune system starts to shut down. he knows he's dying, but he doesn't want to. after all, he's survived the damned leviathans that he's encountered, tommy's made it so far.

and finally, something starts to happen. he starts to feel dizzy while in the in-between of the sparse reef and blood-kelp zone. he thinks he has time to make it back to base, but he doesn't (L).

  
bam! transformation time! he grows roughly the size of a reaper leviathan, and becomes a humanoid-leviathan thing. he grows an extra set of arms around his the bottom/middle of his ribs, grows a funky looking tail (im thinking gold/dark red scales with whiteish bioluminescence. he wakes up, and sees an enormous, unidentified leviathan that looks freakishly human-like(like tommy himself. HEY MUMZA!!)

eventually, sbi wake up from their coma to find tommy missing. they read through different PDA entries tommy leaves, and set out to find him in the still-powered base. they find the equipment tommy built and customised for them, and use it. 

as they enter the area where the dunes/lower blood kelp zone merge, they find a reaper leviathan that goes to attack them. however, a wahlesong/screech overpowers the reaper leviathan's screeching, and it tackles the reaper leviathan. blah blah blah, fight scene, and the other leviathan turns towards the sbi's cyclops. it swims closer, two main eyes and two smaller eyes reflect with the light of the cyclops, but they'd know that face anywhere.

idk really how to end this, and again, this is planning mode rn, but yeah. viola.

hopefully i'll make some art for this soon. if you'd like to give me ideas for some filler scenes (or any other scene. please. i know ill need the help.

1hf82jp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/1hf82jp/age_of_dx/,age of dx ,"Turned 42 today. I was diagnosed when I was 17. I remember so vividly the female doctor rubbing her hand over the trigger points and explaining to my mother how terribly sick I was and I needed extra care. At this point I hated my mother but I didn't understand her damage. I have had everything done to my body including therapist (who I still see today, so crazy) chiropractor, neurologist injections/ablations, trigger point injections, botox, pharmaceuticals, endless drugs, endless, stretching, working out hurts, walking my dog after work is so joyful yet excruciating. Once I changed my careers in 2018 to become a special education teacher, my mind blew when I studied ADHD, which I diagnosed myself with at a much younger age however my mother always told me ""it's all in your head"" and yes, while there is some truth to this, it isn't my truth. 

Disabilities include emotional disabilities such as ADHD including anxiety and depression, unhealed trauma, abuse, shame, autism. Zero understanding, zero knowledge and zero support. I didn't learn how to take care of myself as a female until my daughter was 14 and omg raising a teenager alone, anyway, this illness has been in my body since I was small or in utero. What I found in my research was some extremely upsetting unhealed trauma/abuse I was carrying and had never spoken about it. My parents divorced when I was young and I had a ""new dad"" and my father and his family, who I am so much alike, were just poof gone. Carrying hell and grief until my daughter goes through her paternal history, ugh it was gut wrenching to unravel all of these things all while I needed to be emotionally available for my daughter but that's truly what my bloodline needed. My mother was shame;  all she did was shame me. Me who is the person completely out of control who I look like, exactly like my father, her ex. I was told when I turned 18, she would get me a nose job to help change my profile and a consult on boob jobs too, because my boobs were uneven. Imagine having that as a ""family"" joke around the ""family"" table with your ""new dad"" On top of traveling this journey with fibromyalgia, I have also realized how damaging my mother's insults were. She raised me to take care of HER first when truly in every situation and aspect of our lives, we should take care of ourselves FIRST. So grateful I teacher high school special education health. I learn about the health triangle along side my learning students. We focus and discover all the ways to have a balanced health triangle. Learning about Mindfulness just changed everything for me. Stepping into learning about shame, childhood abuse and trauma, lack of needs being met

Here is my information: 

Thankfully I have medicinal cannabis. I smoke, drink, vape, eat, smooth on. Everything about cannabis and the plant, not hemp, but the cannabis plant fascinates me. It all makes sense while it was criminalizing. The :Big Shots"" realized there would be zero money made on their faux drugs. So they ruined her. Thankful Mary Jane is making a comeback. I have been smoking since I was 14. 

If there is an acronym illness associated with Fibro, I definitely have it. TMG,IBS, RLS, ON, CT, GERD

no gluten

limited dairy to basically nothing if I want a dairy treat, I use lactated pills, IBS

No hot coffee due to GERD. I only drink cold coffee with frothed almond milk and maple syrup

no red sauce, GERD

Perimenopausal so more inflamed, more pain during follicular phase (two weeks of HELL)

No fast food/soda/cigarettes/limited alcohol (only red wine; pinot noir) 

focused on how my grandmother ate/survived. 

This is what I take to manage my shortcomings: vitamin D, Vitamin B, Lyrica, BP med, female hormone blend, fish oil

My diet consists of weekly salmon intake, green foods, kombucha, hummus, seed crackers, hot tea

Today, for me it is in my head but that's because I have realized there is nothing anyone can do to help me but me remaining calm in my head. Mindfulness helps calm the noise. Mindfulness changed my life and I encourage anyone who hasn't to study it and learn something positive from it. It's not a cure but it does help. Also at the same time, I discovered Adult Children of Alcholics/Dysfunctional Families (ACA- See this is how much I love acronyms) Every week I am reminded, I am not alone.

Picture this: it’s dusk, and we’re wandering a quiet city street we’ve never seen before. The kind of place where cobblestones echo with stories and soft light spills from shuttered windows. There’s no set destination—just us, sharing thoughts, laughter, and half-serious dreams of what we’d do if this moment lasted forever. We stop at a little café, where the coffee is warm and the conversation is even warmer. The world feels infinite, but for now, it’s just the two of us—and that’s more than enough.

I’m here searching for someone who dreams of moments like these. Could that be you?

# About Me

I’m a quiet soul with a curious mind—a writer, future vinyl collector, and lover of golden hours. My passions range from creating playlists that feel like soundtracks to discovering hidden hiking trails and catching fleeting beauty with my camera.

I thrive on deep conversations, small joys, and moments that linger in your memory long after they’ve passed. While I enjoy solo pursuits like gaming or reading, my greatest happiness comes from shared experiences and meaningful connections.

I’m looking to start with friendship—something genuine and unforced, like the first chapter of a great story. Maybe it evolves into something more, but for now, I’d love to connect and see where the pages lead us.

# What I’m Looking For

I’m searching for someone who is kind, thoughtful, and curious—a woman who dreams big, appreciates life’s quirks, and values honesty. You don’t need to have it all figured out (who does?), but you should have a desire to share your world while exploring a new one together.

Whether it’s collaborating on a project, swapping music recommendations, or planning spontaneous adventures, I’m looking for a partner who is ready to dream, build, and laugh along the way.

# What Sets Me Apart

I notice the little things—the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love or how the world feels quieter under a blanket of stars. Loyalty is my foundation. I show up for the big moments and the small ones, believing that consistency and care are the cornerstones of a great connection.

I’m also a romantic in the best way: someone who leaves sweet notes, remembers your favorite things, and turns ordinary days into something a little magical.

If this resonates, let’s swap stories, playlists, or dreams. Whether it’s the start of a friendship or something more, let’s see where our chapter together takes us.",1,1734313089.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

Edit: I wrote this post right after I got home so I didn’t put details, just wanted to make sure people were aware. Basically, we were walking home and just chatting. We walked across 5th and this group of guys (17-19y.o. Maybe?) were talking, someone on a bike ride past them and they kept yelling to pop a wheelie, whatever. I figured they’d say something stupid at us and we’d walk by no biggie. They started barking at us, and one of them made a kissy noise. It really bothered me and I barked back at them and said “f—kyou.” (Not the smartest move, I’m aware, but mama didn’t raise no bitch.) They all stopped and we kept walking, except for this one guy who started to follow us. The (WHITE) guy then threatened to shoot us and called my (also white) boyfriend the n-word.

She ended up leaving the company. We have new managers now and they’re absolutely amazing but I have to work weekends now and I’m not gonna be able to spend Christmas with my family. I got to see my family this past week because my mom had to have emergency surgery.

I need the money but at the same time I don’t know if I can get up at 4:30 in the morning every day For 5 to 6 days a week. I wanna go home for Christmas and I can’t. I need a job but I just want one with less hours and they won’t keep me if I ask for less hours because it’s not beneficial for the company so I have Hurd. so I’ve been looking at some family owned coffee shops to work in that will give me around 20 to 30 hours a week that are only open from like 8 to 2 which would be perfect so I won’t have to wake up basically in the middle of the night I’ll get to call my mom in the morning and take care of my puppy I won’t be completely and utterly exhausted when I get home I do want to do nothing but sleep. So basically I’m asking if I should just quit or if I should stay. I have an interview this Friday at a local coffee shop.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hydrogen gas water is gaining popularity among health enthusiasts and researchers. With its potential benefits for promoting a healthier lifestyle, many are exploring why incorporating this refreshing drink into your routine might be essential. Here are ten reasons why hydrogen gas water could revolutionize your health.

### 1. Powerful Antioxidant Properties

Hydrogen gas water contains molecular hydrogen, which acts as a potent antioxidant. Antioxidants protect your cells from oxidative stress caused by free radicals. This means drinking hydrogen-infused water may support your body in fighting off various diseases, keeping you feeling vibrant and energized.

### 2. Supports Metabolism

Research suggests that hydrogen gas water may enhance metabolic processes in your body. It helps in boosting energy levels, which can empower you to stay active throughout the day. A well-functioning metabolism is vital for maintaining a healthy weight, and hydrogen water may give it that extra boost.

### 3. Promotes Hydration

Staying hydrated is essential for overall health. Hydrogen gas water has smaller molecular clusters, which may allow for better absorption in your cells compared to regular water. This can enhance hydration, ensuring your body gets the fluids it needs to function optimally.

### 4. Reduces Inflammation

Chronic inflammation is linked to numerous health issues, from joint pain to heart disease. Drinking hydrogen gas water may help to reduce inflammation in your body, providing relief from discomfort and promoting overall well-being. This can be particularly beneficial for those with inflammatory conditions.

### 5. Enhances Exercise Recovery

If you’re someone who exercises regularly, hydrogen gas water can play a key role in your recovery. Some studies indicate that it may help decrease muscle fatigue and speed up recovery time after workouts. This means you can get back to your routine quicker and with less soreness.

### 6. Improves Skin Health

The benefits of hydrogen gas water extend to your skin as well. By drinking it, you could experience improved skin elasticity and hydration, which is crucial for a youthful appearance. Additionally, its antioxidant properties help combat skin aging, making it a worthy addition to your beauty regimen.

### 7. Supports Brain Health

Your brain requires adequate hydration to function correctly, and hydrogen gas water helps with that. Studies indicate that hydrogen may have neuroprotective effects. This means it could help shield your brain from age-related decline and cognitive disorders, promoting better mental clarity and focus.

### 8. Aids Digestive Health

Hydrogen gas water may also positively impact your digestive system. Some evidence suggests it can help reduce symptoms of digestive distress and promote gut health. A healthy gut is essential for overall well-being, as it affects everything from digestion to your immune system.

### 9. Potential Cancer-Fighting Properties

While more research is needed, preliminary studies have shown that hydrogen gas may offer potential protective benefits against cancer. Although it’s not a cure or treatment, adding hydrogen gas water to your regimen might promote healthier cellular function, which is vital for preventing disease progression.

### 10. Easy to Integrate into Daily Life

Last but not least, incorporating hydrogen gas water into your daily routine is simple. You can drink it instead of regular water or use it in smoothies or cooking. This means it’s not only beneficial but also incredibly easy to make part of your life.

1hf7rut,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyConsumerReviews/comments/1hf7rut/best_coffee_scale_finally_found_my_endgame_coffee/,Best Coffee Scale (finally found my end-game coffee scale after trying 6 different ones),"After cycling through what feels like every coffee scale on the market (literally had 7 different ones over the past few years), I think I can finally stop searching. The Tally Pro has been my daily driver for the past three months, and it's genuinely changed my morning coffee routine.

For context: I'm super into pour-over coffee, and I've used everything from the basic $20 Amazon scales to the much-discussed Acaia Pearl. My partner actually laughed at me for buying ""yet another scale"" but even she admits this one's different.

What makes this one special:

The response time is incredibly quick - no more that annoying lag when you're trying to nail your pour rate. My old Timemore scale would always show the weight a second too late, which meant overshooting my pours constantly.

The screen is actually readable in the morning (my tired eyes appreciate this). It's got this OLED display that's crystal clear even in low light, and the numbers are big enough that I don't need to squint or reach for my glasses.

Build quality is seriously premium. The glass top is a game-changer - so much easier to clean than plastic, and it just feels substantial. When my friend (who's also into coffee) came over, first thing he noticed was how solid it felt.

The brew assist mode is actually useful, not just a gimmick. You input your ratio, and it guides you through the process. I usually do 1:16 for light roasts, and it's made my pours much more consistent.

Minor gripes:

* It's definitely on the pricier side ($185 is no joke)
* The metal buttons can be a bit finicky if you have wet hands
* Auto-off timer could be a bit longer

The scale runs on USB-C charging (finally!) and battery life has been solid - I charge it maybe once every couple weeks with daily use.

Real talk - is it worth $185? If you're just starting out, probably not. But if you're like me and have gone through multiple scales trying to find ""the one,"" this is hands down the best coffee scale I've used. The precision, build quality, and features actually justify the price tag. My coffee game has legitimately improved since switching to the **Tally Pro**.",3,1734312254.0,MyConsumerReviews,0,1.0,False

1hf7qza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1hf7qza/i_feel_like_i_messed_up_any_advice/,I feel like I messed up. Any advice?,"I dated this guy for 3ish months, and now that he ghosted me, I’m trying to understand what went wrong. I know it’s lost, but I want to learn how to improve next time.

We matched online and hit it off with shared interests like anime, witty banter, and books, but we're also pretty different. He loves beer and staying up late, while I've health issues that need a healthy lifestyle. He used to joke about turning me into a night owl.

Our dates were mostly good, but there were some odd moments. Early on, he shared insecurities about his looks and how he loves formal clothes but avoids wearing them because he fears looking weird. I didn’t know how to respond and just listened quietly. I also noticed he avoided sharing his opinions, even when I encouraged him. Still, we usually had a great time together, and he even helped me move into my new apartment.

Then things became inconsistent. He works two jobs, but he began canceling or postponing dates. It didn't matter if I suggested places and events. His communication also fluctuated. One time, we had a conflict when he walked me through a ""dangerous"" area at night. I panicked because of past trauma (I didn’t explain). He seemed surprised and quiet afterward. The date ended abruptly when he left me at a coffee shop at 8 p.m. due to an “emergency” at his restaurant—which is a 1.5-2 hour drive away and closes at 10 p.m. I felt like he was trying to end things. I had to take an uber to go home.

He apologized the next day, saying he loved how straightforward I was and how we're like day and night. We hung out again, and while it was good, it felt more like friends. On our last date, we stopped by my apartment, and he asked about the flower bouquet I had on my table (I bought them earlier that day for myself). I joked about needing to feel appreciated, and he kissed me. He tried to take things further, but I refused because I’m not into casual sex. He then insisted I promise never to ghost/block him and to keep dating. He mentioned his insecurities again (clothes), and I didn’t know what to say.

After that, my anxiety spiraled. A lot of things went wrong in my life—job/health issues (including potentially dangerous breast cysts), family drama, and losing my only two friends—and I became clingy. I was texting 15-20 consecutive messages daily. The last 2 days before getting control over myself, I was seeking reassurance that we’d see each other again. He told me to stay calm but vague on when we could meet again. I also didn’t explain why I was so anxious. 

2 weeks later, I mentioned I’d be traveling to my hometown for the holidays. He proposed a date—the same day as my birthday, but I don't know if he remembered—but on that day, he disappeared most of the day. At 4ish pm, he said we could meet if I still wanted to, but he needed to wait for his employee. By 7-8 p.m., he canceled again because his brother was sick and he had to cover at the restaurant.

He asked when I was flying because he wanted to see me before I left. I sent a quick message but broke down crying and deleted it. I was overwhelmed and sensitive. I resent the details later, but he thought I blocked him because the earlier message was gone, and he couldn’t see my profile photo. I told him I needed to talk (I wanted to clarify any misunderstanding), but he replied late at 11pm. By then, I was in so much pain that I took pills to sleep and missed his message. The next morning, I texted him that I wanted to talk, but he didn’t reply.

After a week of silence, I sent a couple of follow-ups, but still nothing.

I feel terrible like I messed up something that could have been good. I'm taking a break from dating because I really like this guy and must focus on my health. But I'd like closure or to know how I could have prevented things from going south, at least.

AITA for ruining what could have been a good relationship? What do you think I could do to prevent this in the future?",2,1734312181.0,Bumble,5,0.75,False
1hf7ql4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyConsumerReviews/comments/1hf7ql4/auraglow_professional_led_teeth_whitening_system/,Auraglow Professional LED Teeth Whitening System - a coffee addict's solution to professional-grade whitening at home,"After trying literally every teeth whitening solution out there (seriously - from drugstore whitening strips to expensive UV systems), I've finally found what I consider the holy grail of at-home dental whitening technology. My aggressive coffee habit (3-4 cups daily minimum, plus the occasional red wine, don't judge) was starting to show, and professional dental whitening treatments were quoted at $600+ at my local dentist's office - hard pass.

I've been using the Auraglow Professional LED Whitening Kit with 35% carbamide peroxide gel for about 2 months now, and here's my detailed experience:

What's actually working for me:

* The dental-grade LED acceleration light plugs directly into your phone or any USB device instead of needing separate batteries or charging. My husband, who's equally obsessed with teeth whitening, pointed out this is infinitely more convenient than our old battery-operated system that would die mid-treatment
* The professional-strength whitening gel doesn't cause tooth sensitivity like other systems did (and I have naturally sensitive teeth). You get enough gel syringes for 12 complete whitening treatments
* Visible whitening results appeared faster than expected - noticed a significant difference after just 3 thirty-minute sessions
* The mouth tray design actually stays in place, unlike those generic one-size-fits-all trays from other kits

The technical details that matter: The 35% carbamide peroxide concentration is the same professional strength that dental offices use. Each whitening session is 30 minutes, and the gel adhesion technology keeps it in place better than strips or other delivery systems. The LED light acceleration technology serves a genuine purpose - it catalyzes the whitening process for faster results, similar to in-office laser whitening treatments.

Real talk about the investment - it's mid-range for professional LED whitening systems (around $30), which is significantly less than I've spent on professional dental whitening or even premium whitening strips over time. For the professional-grade technology and materials you get, it's exceptionally reasonable.

The not-so-perfect parts (keeping it real):

* The professional LED mouthpiece takes some getting used to. Took me a few treatments to figure out the optimal position for maximum comfort
* You need to remain relatively still during the whitening treatment. I usually just binge-watch something or catch up on emails
* Have to maintain consistent whitening treatments to preserve results (but that's true for any teeth whitening method)
* The whitening gel syringes require careful application to avoid waste

Additional benefits I've noticed:

* Works on both natural teeth and dental work (though results vary)
* The LED light coverage is more comprehensive than other systems I've tried
* Zero enamel damage even with regular use
* Storage case keeps everything organized and clean between treatments
* Customer support actually responds quickly (had a question about gel application)

Bottom line: After extensive experience with 5+ different home whitening systems and professional treatments, the **Auraglow Professional LED Whitening Kit** is genuinely the most effective balance of professional-grade results, comfort, and value I've found in the at-home teeth whitening category. While it's obviously not exactly identical to a $600 dental office treatment, it's surprisingly close for something you can do in your own bathroom while watching Netflix.",2,1734312147.0,MyConsumerReviews,0,1.0,False

I finally gave in last week as I just needed to feel like a real person. It was so enjoyable to enjoy simple things in life like making cookies with my kids and actually eating them , sharing appetizers with my family, eating cheese for the first time since I can remember, going to a party and actually eating something, having a baguette with dinner  - the simple things that most people get to enjoy every day and take for granted. To top it off I really love cooking and entertaining - it’s actually my passion and that has  been taken away from me. 

I’m just ranting a bit as I’m so frustrated with this journey. I’ve been doing the diet since last March with a break over the summer and I don’t even know if it’s completely working. How do you manage to stick with it for months and months and when you don’t see results for such a long time?  When I’m really really diligent things get a little bit better with my symptoms but not enough to justify the sacrifices I’m making.  

 I find it so so difficult to stick with the diet without solid results. I eat reasonably healthy overall - no processed foods, little sugar, lots of greens, juicing - but giving up bread, fruit, dairy, the rare coffee I once enjoyed is just so difficult. Social situations evolve around food and I’m just finding this time of year really hard:(  Just a rant.  Anyone else in this boat?

I tried every year to get friends to commit, but I couldn't get anyone to commit. This year I said screw it and went at it alone.

The overall experience was cool. Downtown St Louis had some fun things to check out during the day. The dome racing exciting to watch. Everyone I met was very friendly. I couldn't believe the amount of race fans there. Everywhere you went in the city, there was just a sea of race shirts.

The bad stuff was how sick I got during and after the event. The first night being there, my throat and lungs were burning from what I guess would be the fumes inside. After 3 days of that, my body was just depleted. After, I believe I contracted covid and then had a week of hell trying to recover from that when I got home. Also, the city and the dome itself is just not equipped for the influx of people. Starting with the hotels, restaurants, and bars. Nobody had nearly enough staffing for the volume of people in the area. Lines everywhere, all day long. Want a coffee in the morning? 1 hour wait at Starbucks. Want a sandwich for lunch? 1 hour wait at the deli. Want a shitty dry $14 hamburger inside the dome? Too bad, they're already sold out. Starving after the races are over because you haven't been able to eat all day? Well the 2-3 restaurants that are still open that late have 1+ hour long lines. The dome doesn't let you leave in the middle of the races to get food nearby either. Once you leave, you need to pay for admission to get back in. The surrounding businesses need to have temporary staffing boosts during this weekend, or the city should bring in food trucks from other areas to help with the demand during the day. Especially since this event has grown every single year. They said 30,000 tickets sold for Saturday night, which had them open the third level. I pretty much went 3 days in downtown living off snacks because I didn't want to stand in lines.

I would say its a one and done type of event. Try it once to say you did it, and then enjoy it at home on Flo Racing because it's not worth the travel, the illness, and the lack of amenities to watch an indoor demo derby.",8,1734311775.0,WorldofOutlaws,16,0.91,False

1hf7hay,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hf7hay/difficult_situation_with_the_inlaws/,Difficult situation with the in-laws,"Bear with me it’s a long story. My husband (24m) and I (23f) have been together for 6 years and married for 2 years. We just had a baby girl in the summer of 2024. So a year ago we started trying for a baby. At that time we were in good terms with his family I loved them and I thought they loved me, I thought they were like a second family to me. I wasn’t ready to tell our families we were trying to have a baby yet but I was close to my sister in law (18f) so I told her to keep it a secret. Not long after that it was my husband’s birthday so I arranged with my mother in law to have a small gathering at her place and to get there early to help cooking. His family is Mexican and my family were exited to learn how to make authentic Mexican food. So everyone arrived early ( like 5 minutes after me and my husband had arrived) and helped cooking the food including my husband in the small kitchen. We were about 12 to 15 people and only 6 to 8 people for in the kitchen. Since there was already a lot of people in the kitchen I entertained the other guests. At some point there was some ingredients missing so I went with my dad to a few grocery stores to find it, we bought it and came back. The evening went on great, or so I thought. Dinner was good everyone was smiling and talking. For context I am very open. I was raised that way, I rarely judge, there is no taboo for me and my family we have just always been that way. Anyway so it just so happened that I made a few jokes identical to the ones my guy best friend did and they were ok with it. Like slapping a guy on the thighs because we were joking around and like ruffling his hair. That guy just happens to be my sister in law’s boyfriend. Anyway later the desert was good with everyone except me. Now hear me out I have a repulsion for anything that contains coffee I have always been this way. I tried many times to drink it but every time I vomit it out immediately and the smell makes me very nauseous. The cake was milk and coffee flavoured but I didn’t know that, seing the colour I thought it was chocolate and I love that. As soon as I put it in my mouth I almost vomited but it didn’t want to be disgusting and dirty everyone so I ran to the bathroom and spit it out. I never said it was bad but when I went back to the table I had to explain that I don’t like code and it tasted like it. So the following week my mil and sil talked with my husband while I was at work. So this is what my husband told me was said. Sil told him I stopped the contraceptive pill and asked if he was aware. To which he said he was of course because it’s a decision we had made together. Then she proceeded to say I was indecent and made her and her boyfriend uncomfortable talking about sex and touching him. ( the boyfriend is a mechanic and had told us about more extreme jokes his guy friends had made with him and he was ok with those I only had said as a joke that “some things needed taking care of” while discretely eying sil back and forth for him to get it). They added that I was supposed to help cooking. That I was rude to say i didn’t like the desert and that I was steeling all the attention at his birthday. When we tried to have a discussion the 4 of us together sil was very mean, insulted my husband to the point where he shed a few tears. Mil didn’t even listen, tuned us out the whole time. So they didn’t talk to me for a year, my husband went to see them like 3 to 4 times since then. They live next door which really sucks but since I became pregnant really fast we couldn’t move and we couldn’t afford to move. They weren’t there the whole time for us during the pregnancy while on the other side my parents helped a lot, they even organized the baby shower. Fast forward to this summer our baby girl was born and the day after (still at the hospital) my husband calls his mom to tell her she was of course supper happy and wanted to meet her the same day. I was tired so I said i didn’t mind. She came to our place when we got home after my parents made us dinner and spent the afternoon with us because they came to pick us up at the hospital. She talked only to my husband and gave me a hello and bye. Our baby is now 4 months old and she came a few times since then and always the same thing she takes my daughter speaks to her in Spanish as If it’s her own daughter and tell her to call her abuelita (which is like grandma in Spanish) and speaks to my husband and ignores me except to say hello and bye. My husband already told her to stop ignoring me it worked a little but not much. I was very disappointed to learn that they never liked me, thought that i was tricking my husband into having a baby with me, that they were sexist and conservatives. Even though we were married in church before having a baby. Me and my husband agree that she can see her once a month maximum and she will not be called grandma because that term is earned and I feel like she doesn’t deserve it. I really don’t want her to see, touch or talk to my daughter at all but my husband wants our daughter to know her at least. AITAH?

1hf7fzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hf7fzb/aitah_for_having_my_husband_around_during/,AITAH for having my husband “around” during hangouts and not walking my friend to her car?,"Please be honest because I'm honestly so unsure. Also, I apologize because I am known to blabber unnecessarily and writing is not really my forte.

So I (20F) recently got married to the most incredible man (22M) that I've met while I was still in community college. I am a Muslim woman, so we didn't ""date"" in the Western style, but we took a liking to each other and got engaged when I was 20, and we've been married for nearly six months now. I have a few friends I've known since high school that I still hang out with occasionally, let's call them Sarah (19F), Janice and Emily (both 20F). Sarah is still at the community college, Janice transferred to a fairly nearby university, and Emily is still working as a retail worker-- props to all of them. I am a housewife and I also run a small Etsy business, while my husband is a CNA. Recently, I found out about these improv classes that our community center has on Saturday evenings, and I thought it would be fun for the four of us girls to do together. They agreed with me, so we all enrolled. One thing I forgot to mention about me is that I am ""overly paranoid"", I suppose. Before I was married, I would never have gone out during the nighttime and my friends would tease me because I would walk them to and from the bathroom, even in the day. Not to sound too damsel-in-distress-like, but I am so glad that I have my husband around to protect me now. He isn't very fit, but he's burly enough that people wouldn't try to bother me.

I guess this is where I start to be the AH? Whenever we go to those improv classes, I  would always make my husband stay somewhere nearby for safety, so he stays in the community center's library until our class is over. (He's a huge bookworm like me, so he's happy to do so). I didn't think much of this arrangement because he wasn't actually hovering over us, so I didn't think my friends would mind. After class, Emily, Janice, Sarah, my husband, and myself would walk to the The Coffee Bean nearby so that the girls and I could have our weekly chat and my husband sits at another table. (He does this because in my religion, husbands will try to separate themselves from their wive's friends to make them feel more comfortable. For example, when I tell him I'm having my friends over at our place, he'll step out the house and find something to do). Emily usually leaves first because she works the earlier weekend shifts, so my husband and I walk her to her car. She never expressed any discomfort, as far as I could tell, so I've kept doing this for the past few weeks. 

Last week, though, as as we were walking her to her car, she asked if she could speak to me alone, so my husband walked a couple feet away. She then starts to berate me for constantly bringing my husband over to our hangouts and that she hated how I was acting like I was some kind of princess that needed protection, and how I was pushing this onto them. She was talking about how I used to be an independent woman, but now I was just some fragile little housewife that needs her man everywhere. This really hurt me because I didn't think it was a big deal. I think I'm still as outgoing as I had been, and I just wanted to settle down. Absolutely no hate to all the working women out there because I think that you are all so incredible and strong willed, but I never really wanted a fast paced, stressful life, so I was happy to be a homemaker instead. I don't think that makes me weak at all. I asked her if she was maybe just uncomfortable with my husband walking with us because she didn't know him that well, but she said that she was uncomfortable with the thought that I was treating her like she needed some guy around to feel safe in general. Maybe I don't understand how it feels because growing up in a Muslim household, I was taught that the men in my family were there TO keep us away from harm, but I guess that may have been insulting to Emily? Anyways, I decided to stop walking her to her car after that because I didn't feel comfortable walking back by myself, without my husband. 

So yesterday, we had improv classes again, which mostly went as it normally goes. I didn't tell our other friends about Emily's complaints because I felt embarrassed that I was making her uncomfortable, though unintentionally, and it was a little awkward between us. Like usual, when we were getting coffe, Emily was leaving early, but this time I didn't walk her back to her car. About half an hour later, my husband and I were driving back home when I checked my phone and I saw that Emily posted a couple of voice messages in the group chat. She was shouting at me, telling me how I was a bad friend for letting her walk out by herself, and how she thought that there was a man following her to her car. She told me that I should have been outside, at least, to watch and make sure that she was okay, and that I wasn't being a girl's girl. I feel bad because I usually wouldn't let a girl walk around by herself, but I literally just did what I thought she wanted? I didn't want to tell the others about it, but I had to defend myself, so I apologized and told her that while I regretted letting her go by herself, she was the one who told me that she didn't want my husband around as protection and that I've stated numerous times to at I don't feel safe outside without him around. Sarah was really angry about it, saying that it wasn't fair that Emily was pinning the blame on me and that it's weird that she doesn't like my husband, because he has always been respectful of them. I appreciate Sarah  for defending him and me, but I think that it's totally valid for Emily to feel uncomfortable around him because, after all, it's not like he's HER husband. However, I totally think she's wrong for trying to act like I was intentionally trying to put her in danger to make a point or something. (Though I might have been a little petty because she was making me out to be some meek, needy housewife). 

I am all up for your opinion, though. Do you think I should have still made sure she was safe or was I right to stay safe myself?",0,1734311247.0,AITAH,9,0.5,False

I have repeatedly told Amanda (My older sister) to leave Jason (my husband) alone, because I know they have polar opposite political views. I noticed that she was going through a post of Jason's last night hear-reacting to opposing views on it. 

**I sent her this message last night**: Hey, I just want to kindly remind you that if you don't like something Jason has posted you don't need to interact with it. 

# 

She didn't respond, but unfriended Jason

**Afterwards I sent her this:** 

I need to share something that's been weighing on me. This morning, I noticed that you unfriended Jason. I want you to know that I'm okay with that—honestly, I think it might be for the best. If boundaries can't be respected, sometimes space is necessary. That said, it still hurts that you didn't respond to me before taking that step.  
	I know you and Justin have different beliefs than Jason and I, and I've always accepted and respected that. However, what's been hard for me to accept is the way Jason is treated—by you and others in the family—just because his opinions differ. I don't agree with your beliefs either, but I do my best to respect your perspective and keep my thoughts to myself. I wish that same respect could be extended to Jason and me.  
	Over the past few years, I've felt a growing distance between us, and a lot of it comes from how I feel during our interactions. Too often, I walk away feeling dismissed, talked down to, or unsupported. I've started avoiding talking or seeing you because I feel I will just get hurt again. For example, when you screenshotted one of Jason's posts and shared it in the family group chat to make fun of him, it crossed a line for me. You said it was a joke, but it didn't feel that way. It felt like an attempt to mock him publicly and, by extension, me. I'll admit I reacted poorly, and I'm sorry for that. But I need you to understand that Jason is my husband, whom I love dearly, and the father of my children. There should be no question of mutual respect for him in our family because he is family.  
	Also, when I shared my dream of working in the healthcare field, your response crushed me. You said it wasn't for me because the field is ""too competitive."" I cried for an entire day because it felt like my dreams weren't supported by the person I looked up to the most. That's why I didn't tell you when I quit my job at the bank—a job I hated—and went back to school to pursue those dreams. I deserve to be supported, not looked down on. And the truth is, I've been thriving! I've found a group of people who believe in me, and I'm proud to say I have a 4.0 GPA as an adult college student. I would've loved to celebrate that with you, but it's hard to share those victories when I feel like I can't count on your support.  
	Even smaller moments have hurt deeply. When I told you I learned that an iris is a sphincter, your response—""You really didn't know that?""—made me feel small. No, I didn't know, and it's not something everyone knows. If the roles were reversed, I would've let you share what you learned without diminishing it. I even talked to my therapist about how much that moment upset me. I wish you could let me have my excitement without feeling the need to point out what you already know.  
	Additionally, when I posted about my PTSD and starting treatment, I was overwhelmed by the love and support from so many people in our family. But from you? Silence. Can you even imagine how much that hurt me? Growing up, you and Josh were my heroes. You were my safe space, the person I turned to. But now, I barely recognize our relationship. Sometimes, it feels like you enjoy putting me down. When you laughed about me not being in Grandma's will, it wasn't about the money (I think Grandma should donate everything to her favorite animal shelter)—it was about how easily you can hurt me without even thinking twice.  
	Furthermore, when I told you about moving to Iron Mountain and buying a house, I was excited to share something joyful with you. But calling Iron Mountain ""ghetto"" and dismissing my decoration ideas as ugly felt intentionally hurtful.  
	I know this message is long, but it's not meant to attack you or make you feel bad. I just needed to tell you how I've been feeling. At one point, I even considered going no contact with you because I couldn't see a future where you would even be kind to me. Jason, of all people, talked me out of it because he knows how much I love and care about you and Niko.  
	Instead, I've decided to take a step back from our relationship—not to close the door, but to give us both some space. If you still want a relationship with me and my family, that decision is entirely yours. I won't force anyone to stay in my life, but I also can't continue to allow myself to be hurt repeatedly.  
	If you do want to rebuild our relationship, I'd like to have an open and honest conversation about how I've been feeling so we can move forward together. If you're not ready for that, I'll respect your choice and continue to step back until you feel the time is right.  
I love you.



**This is what Amanda wrote me:** 

Amber,   
  
I’m going to try and address your comments as best I can.   
  
Firstly, I didn’t respond to your comment you made earlier in regard to not interacting with Jason’s posts because I didn’t see it until 5:30 this morning and had to get myself and Nicholi ready for school and work. I got to work and worked.   
  
I’m not on FB much at all and I don’t get messenger or FB notifications. I turned it off because I just don’t care about FB. My posting history will show that. 3 posts since August.   
  
I don’t treat Jason any differently than anyone else. When he’s around I’m respectful towards him and friendly.   
  
Yes, we have different views but I don’t post on a social media platform and expect that others of different views don’t comment or interact. I saw his post and read the comments. I didn’t comment on his post or interact with him in any way. I liked someone else’s comment and decided at that point I should just remove myself from the situation.   
  
He was on my friend’s list for one reason: to get updates and photos of you and the kids. There haven’t been many posts like that for quite some time as it was so I did what was best for me.   
  
And yes, I was just joking around because when I saw the post at 5AM about the gingerbread transgender cookies. I was saying it was way too early for a post like that. I would have shared that in the group chat even if it wasn’t Jason who posted it. It was a “I haven’t even had my coffee yet and I’m seeing posts to deal with politics”.   
  
Regarding your second comment, I have always been supportive of you. I don’t talk down to you or dismiss your comments. I want nothing more than you to be successful in life. When I said it was a competitive field, I was speaking from my experience trying to get into the healthcare field. Overall, it is a competitive field because it is the fastest growing industry and there are many people trying to get into the field. It had nothing to do with you pursuing a career in the medical field. I never said you couldn’t do it or that you had no chance. There was no reason for you to assume that was my intention when I said that. Congratulations on your GPA. I’m glad that you’re doing so well in school.   
  
Also, when I said you didn’t know? I was joking around because I didn’t know either. I was enjoying your messaging in the family chat with what you’ve learned and chimed in about things that I learned as well when I went to college to try and be supportive and add onto the conversation.   
  
Regarding your PTSD post. I’m not on FB that often. When I did see it days later, I didn’t know what to even say to a post like that so I didn’t comment. It’s not like I didn’t care about your post or you.   
  
As far as you moving, I don’t know enough about Michigan for you to even take that comment seriously. I didn’t even know where iron mountain was in Michigan until recently. The only parts of Michigan I know about is the part that I lived on the border of. Every state is similar with rural and suburb parts. My “ghetto” comment was not to offend you but to make light of the fact that you’d be moving and it would be harder to see you and the kids.   
  
Regarding Grandma’s will. I wasn’t laughing at you. I was laughing at the fact that none of us are probably in her will because mom is going to be in her will and that will probably be it. At the end of the day, does it really matter if we are or not? No, it doesn’t. It’s her possessions and her savings and she can do with it as she pleases.   
  
I don’t make fun of you. I’m sorry that you take the things that I say out of context or hurtful as it’s never my intention.   
  
I do love you but rather than cut me out of your life or stepping back as you have been I’d rather you ask questions about things I say or tell me you feel one way or the other rather than just assuming I get my rocks off on hurting my little sister and you spend the night crying.   
  
I very much have a sarcastic and dry sensor of humor. I’m almost never serious. So ask questions like “are you being serious?” Or “do you actually think or feel that way?”

**This is what I wrote her next:**

As you can see I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about your response, and while I appreciate that you took the time to address my concerns, I need to be honest about how it made me feel. It came across more as a defense of your actions and intentions than an acknowledgment of how your words and actions have affected me. While I understand that you didn’t mean to hurt me, intent doesn’t negate impact. The pain I’ve experienced is real, regardless of your intentions, and it feels dismissive when you explain things away or play them off as jokes.  
  
When you said the only reason you kept Jason on Facebook was to see pictures of my children, it was beyond disrespectful. Jason is not just a conduit for updates about my family—he is my husband, the father of my children, and someone I love deeply. To frame it that way made it seem like he wasn’t good enough for anything beyond that, as though you hold so little respect for him as a person. That sentiment doesn’t just hurt Jason; it hurts me. I am a package deal with Jason—you cannot have one without the other. Hearing you dismiss him in that way makes me question whether our relationship can even move forward. If you can’t respect him, you’re not respecting me.  
  
You also mentioned not knowing what to say when I posted about my PTSD, and I need you to understand how that silence affected me. I didn’t need the perfect words—I just needed something. Even a simple “I love you” or “I’m here for you” would have meant so much. Your silence felt like a lack of care or support, and that added to the pain I was already experiencing. Acknowledging someone’s struggles doesn’t require perfection; it just requires effort, and the lack of any effort from you in that moment spoke volumes.  
  
When you say things like “I didn’t mean it that way” or “you took it out of context,” it shifts the responsibility onto me for how I interpreted your words, rather than recognizing the role your actions played in causing that hurt. Psychologically, this is known as blame-shifting, and it’s deeply damaging to relationships. It puts the burden on me to justify my feelings or change my perspective instead of fostering mutual understanding and accountability. It’s not fair to expect me to carry the weight of managing how your words come across when healthy relationships require both people to take responsibility for their communication.  
  
What I needed to hear was something like, “I see how my actions hurt you, and I’m sorry for causing you pain.” Acknowledging my feelings would have gone so much further in helping us rebuild trust than justifying or explaining your actions. Accountability isn’t about whether you meant to hurt me—it’s about owning the fact that I was hurt and committing to making changes to prevent that from happening again.  
  
If we’re going to move forward, accountability is essential. That means not just explaining your intentions, but truly accepting responsibility for the impact your actions and words have had. If you’re unable or unwilling to take that step, then I don’t see how we can move forward. Respect, trust, and accountability are the foundation of any meaningful relationship, and without them, we’ll stay stuck in this painful cycle.  
  
I love you, but love alone isn’t enough. I need to feel like my feelings, my family, and my boundaries are being respected. I am willing to work on this relationship, but only if you’re willing to meet me halfway. If you can’t take responsibility for your actions and commit to change, I can’t continue subjecting myself or my family to this hurt. The choice to move forward is yours, but I need to protect my own peace, even if that means stepping back. 

  
Furthermore, if you choose to move forward in mending our relationship and taking accountability, I am requesting that you apologize to Jason. I am not asking you to be his friend or even to like him, but an apology would demonstrate that you are willing to make things right with me. This request is not unreasonable, and I want to be clear that I am only willing to move forward in our relationship if you are willing to take this step.  
  
An apology would show that you understand how your actions and words have affected Jason and how they have impacted my relationship with him. Your treatment of him has made him feel devalued as a member of our family, which has caused hurt for both of us. Jason is not just my husband; he is part of this family. Disrespect toward him doesn’t just hurt him—it hurts me too.  
  
I will give you until the end of this week to decide whether you are willing to take this step. The apology does not need to be long or drawn out. Something as simple as, “I’m deeply sorry for how my actions and words have come across to you as a family member. I respect you as a person and not just as my sister’s husband,” would suffice. However, if you are unwilling to take this step, that choice reflects on you—not me. I also want to make it clear that I will be reading the message if you send it, and I will not accept a cheap or backhanded apology.  
  
If you want me and my kids in your life, I need to see that you are willing to put in the work and take responsibility for your actions. This apology isn’t just about Jason; it’s about showing mutual respect in our relationship and creating a space where everyone feels valued and supported. I will no longer tolerate jokes at Jason’s expense or mistreatment of him. Jason has done nothing to deserve this kind of behavior, and I cannot and will not have someone in my life, or my kids’ lives, who feels entitled to belittle him.  
  
I understand that what I’m asking for might be difficult, but I am asking you to put aside the justifications and genuinely put yourself in someone else’s shoes. I want you to see how your actions have treated both Jason and me over the past few years. You have hurt me deeply, and I’ve allowed myself to be a doormat for too long, enduring that hurt. Setting these boundaries is necessary for us to have a healthy relationship and to enjoy each other’s company without causing more pain.  
  
This request isn’t about punishing you or making you feel bad—it’s about respecting my boundaries and my family. If I don’t hear from you, that’s okay. I have already said I’m willing to take a step back from our relationship. However, if I do not see an apology to Jason by the end of the week, I will no longer be willing to work on our relationship until you do.

  


**This is her finale response:**

 As I said previously, it was not my intention to hurt you. My explaining my side of it was immediately turned into blame-shifting rather than you realizing it was me explaining to you that I wasn’t trying to hurt you. This can’t be one sided.   
  
You did attack me with the numerous comments of exchanges that have occurred over the last 5+ years considering you failed to talk to me about any of it until now. How was I ever supposed to know how you felt or that I hurt you if you didn’t talk to me about it?   
  
Your remark about who I am as a person for not commenting on your PTSD post is a real treat. Who made you so self-entitled to think that I am a person who doesn’t value you for not commenting? Did you ever consider that something like that on a social media platform is not something that I’m comfortable with commenting on? No, you didn’t. Instead, you were so self-absorbed that you immediately decided that something we BOTH went through was something I would be okay with having shown to the world. No one needs to know what I went through when it comes to our childhood and I don’t feel the need to address it on a social media platform.   
  
If you wanted to call me and discuss what we went through as kids and what you went through with your sexual assault, I would have made the time and make sure you were OK but for you to assume that me not commenting on a post is a declaration of my personality and self-worth is ridiculous. I understand that you haven’t moved on from things in the past, but I have. I also went through a rape, and I also dealt with our childhood trauma. But I learned to cope with it and sought the help that I needed. I understand that you have not learned to cope with things from your past or the emotions that you deal with on a daily basis because everybody goes at their own pace but you attacking me goes over the line.   
  
Your opinion on my comment about how he was on my friend’s list so I could get updates was a fairly extreme way to take it. He was posting more updates of your activities as a family more than you were. I would love seeing them since I rarely get to see you or the kids. Lately, it hasn’t been posts about family and has been becoming overwhelmingly political. Me removing him from my friend’s list was MY boundary to help respect yours. It was me drawing a line so I didn’t upset you. You can say I’m alienating him all you want but he’s doing that to himself and I have EVERY right exclude him from my friends list WITHOUT your permission.   
  
Now you’re telling me that you’ll use the kids and our relationship as a punishment because I don’t like what Jason constantly posts on a social media platform—Because I liked someone’s comment on a post. I’m sorry but that does not show any sign of disrespect. That shows that we have different views. If you feel as if he is being treated differently you both should consider not constantly posting politically radical posts on a FB page that everyone can see.   
  
I don’t want to hear about how you bite your tongue on our different views. We don’t post political posts and rarely talk about politics. Very seldom does it even come up. Then there’s the both of you posting constantly. You wonder why so many people in your family, you know the ones you keep alienating, show concern? Maybe it’s posts like “raising a communist household” when we live in a capitalist country or posts that show no morals or values when it comes to a man’s family not have closure with finding out who murdered him? Is no one allowed to show that they’re concerned about you or your life?   
  
I know for a fact that you and Josh have had several conversations in regard to my fiancé and my choices because Josh told me about the things you’ve discussed while he was drunk. You can’t demand respect for yourself and Jason when you can’t give the same in return. I didn’t throw a fit or accuse anyone of anything because I know it was done out of love and concern.   
  
With this being said, attempting to bully me into an apology to Jason just so I can have a relationship with you and the kids is grand. I will not give that to you or him. I have never said anything to devalue him as a person or spoke to him in any demeaning way. I will not live my life walking on egg shells or being professional with you because I don’t know what will be taken the wrong way and not communicated. Especially if your emotions and boundaries are the only ones to be considered to have a relationship and mine are disregarded as being a bully or a worthless person. If I can’t be my joking and sarcastic self then us remaining to be in contact just won’t work.    
  
At this point, I’m saying goodbye. I wish you nothing but success and happiness in life and the kids grow up healthy and happy. I wish that this isn’t your ultimatum as this hurts deeply. There will be no further contact from me unless you both consider what your actions and words have done and apologize to me.  
  
I will still always be here for you, if you need me, like I always have been. I love you all.

  
I couldn't fight with her anymore because I honestly can't stand conflict. 

**My finale response was:**

Ok, I accept your goodbye.

1hf7f9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hf7f9i/is_she_interested_in_me_romantically_or/,Is She Interested in Me Romantically or Professionally? Confused After First ‘Hangout,"I recently met a girl at work, and I’m really confused about her intentions. She’s very social and seems comfortable talking to everyone, but when we worked our first shift together (and really talked for the first time), she seemed especially interested in me. We had great conversations at work, and she even said we should talk more after work.

When I texted her later, she seemed very straightforward and professional—completely different from how she was at work. She ended up asking me to hang out at a coffee shop.

At the coffee shop, the vibe was… interesting. She was comfortable talking to me, but it felt very professional, almost like an interview. She asked a lot of questions about my future, personality, and outlook on life, saying she wanted to get to know me better. She wasn’t flirty(in my opinion), but she did compliment my personality and perspectives.

The conversation had a lighthearted tone, but she also mentioned business topics, and at one point said, “This is something I like to do with people.” That comment threw me off and made me wonder if this is more of a professional networking thing than a personal interest.

At the end of the hangout, she said she wanted to meet up again, but she also sent me a book and asked me to read it so we could discuss it—kind of like a teacher assigning homework.

For context, I’m 20 and she’s 21 (almost 22). I’ve been in one long-term relationship since high school, so I don’t have a ton of dating experience, but I thought I’d be able to recognize romantic interest. Now, I’m not so sure.

I feel like this could’ve been my first “grown-up date,” but I can’t tell if she’s into me romantically and just has a professional vibe, or if this is more of a business networking kind of thing.

What do you think her intentions are based on her actions? And how should I approach this moving forward?",2,1734311186.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1hf7e00,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hf7e00,Pão de queijo - Brazilian cheese bread,"First time I’ve made them. Mom always made them and stuck a bunch in the freezer for me to bake later. I must admit it came out well. 

Note: You ask 100 Brazilians how to make cheese bread and you’ll get 100 recipes. I like the fennel seeds in them but you can omit. You can find polvilho azedo (sour manioc starch) in Brazilian stores and even online. 

I like to eat them with strong and sweet black coffee (cafézinho). 

- 1kg of polvilho azedo (sour manioc starch)
- Tablespoon of salt
- 1.25 cups of water
- 1.25 cups of milk
- 1.25 cups of oil
- 2 tablespoons of fennel seed
- 6 eggs
- .5kg of shredded Parmesan

- Toast fennel seeds
- Boil liquids and fennel seeds, turn heat off as soon as it boils
- Mix dry contents in bowl
- Pour liquids into bowl and mix. There should be enough liquid for all the polvilho to hydrate.
- Let mixture cool
- Add eggs and mix.
- Add cheese
- Use ice cream scooper to portion dough. Wet hands with olive oil and roll dough into balls.
- Place balls onto cookie sheet
- Bake at 350F degrees for 25 minutes or until it’s golden on top

- Any dough that won’t be baked that day
    - Spray cookie sheet with oil
    - Place dough balls tightly packed onto sheet
    - When there’s no more room for dough balls lightly spray tops of dough balls and place plastic sheet on top
    - You can place additional dough balls on top of the first layer of balls. When completed lightly spray dough balls and cover with plastic sheet.
    - Freeze overnight and transfer dough balls to ziplock gallon bag.
    - To bake place frozen dough balls into 350F degrees oven for 25-30 minutes or until it gets golden.
