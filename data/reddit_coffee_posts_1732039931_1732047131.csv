**What is Your Manifestation?**

This is the most crucial question because you need to clarify your desires to the universe. However, I want to emphasize that your manifestation should be *yours*, not something imposed by your parents or anyone else. When you pursue goals that aren't truly yours, due to lack of choice, manifestation becomes less effective. But if the goal is genuinely yours, I assure you, you will manifest it.

When manifesting, focus on a single goal at a time. Be clear about your desire and free from doubt and fear. If you lack initial belief, start with smaller goals like manifesting a cup of coffee, a pair of earphones, or anything else that doesn't require strong preexisting beliefs.

The biggest question is, how can you determine if a goal is truly yours?

**Is Your Goal Really Yours?**

Many people who try manifestation wonder: ""Is this goal truly mine, or is it someone else's?""

Here are some questions to ask yourself:

1. **Would I still pursue this goal even if it takes one or two years (or more) to achieve?** (Changed ""than"" to ""than"" for consistency and ""more than 2 year"" to a clearer time frame)
2. **Does this goal align with my values and long-term vision for myself?**
3. **Do I feel genuine excitement and passion for this goal?**
4. **How will achieving this goal make me feel?**
5. **Am I willing to make sacrifices to achieve this goal?**

If you answer yes to all five questions, you're on the right track! If not, it's time to explore different options.

**Finding Your True Goal Through Passion**

Still stuck? Consider your hobbies. If you love reading books and have a favorite niche, could you become a content writer in that area?

Here's the biggest realization: when you're working towards a goal that truly aligns with you, the work won't feel like a chore. You'll be excited and engaged, not worried or bored.

**What You Need to Manifest**

Manifestation is like learning a new language about the universe. Successful manifestors share a common trait: they cultivate a feeling of fulfillment and gratitude for everything they have.

**The Key to Manifestation: Gratitude**

Be thankful for everything, big or small. Even your height! Gratitude is the key to manifesting anything.

**Identifying Your Blocks**

Think about your goal and write down any obstacles that might be hindering your manifestation. Focus on your own thoughts and beliefs, not external factors. Remember, when you change your inner world, your outer world follows.

**The Four Pillars of Manifestation**

To successfully manifest, you need four things: belief, emotion, a clear goal, and action. All of these elements are crucial.



**How to Create Belief and Emotion for Your Manifestation**

I want to be clear that everything takes time, depending on its energy. You need to practice creating belief and emotion. Here's how:

**Creating Belief** To create belief, you need to normalize your goal. Check out this post [Best time to Manifest Love](https://www.shubook.in/best-time-to-manifest-love/) for detailed instructions on how to do this.

**Creating Emotion** Once you've created belief and emotion, feel them regularly. If negative emotions arise, check out this post [Why your manifestation taking so much time](https://www.shubook.in/how-to-know-if-someone-is-manifesting-you-c/) to learn how to break negative patterns.

**The Best Time to Manifest at Night** 

The best time to manifest is one hour before sleep. Disconnect from all distractions, especially your phone. Write a story about how you'll feel after achieving your goal, what your parents will feel, and your thoughts in that situation. Go to sleep with this energy, and you'll wake up feeling energized and positive.

**Manifesting at 3 AM** The process is similar to manifesting before sleep. Write about how you feel after achieving your goal and express gratitude to the universe. At 3 AM, focus on gratitude for everything you have and relax your body. Trust the universe and accept your current situation while taking action towards your goals.

**The Final Word** Remember, take action, believe in your goals, and trust the universe. Until next time, goodbye!

So, I was at the airport this morning, waiting in line to grab some much-needed coffee. There was someone standing in front of me who looked like a trans woman (at least, that’s what I assumed based on appearances - her breasts). She was wearing a t-shirt that said, “All angels are transsexual.” Honestly, I thought it was clever, so I tapped her on the shoulder and said, “Ma’am, that’s a funny t-shirt!”

Well… it didn’t land like I thought it would. She turned around, visibly upset, and practically yelled at me for calling her “ma’am.” I was kind of stunned because I meant it in a positive way. The whole line turned to watch, and before I knew it, TSA got involved because, you know, commotions at an airport can’t just stay commotions. I tried to calmly explain what I said, and luckily, a few people in line backed me up.

But then TSA called the police. Yes, actual police. I had to explain myself again, tell them the entire story, and by the time it was over, I’d missed my flight. The TSA agent who escorted me away apologized, which I appreciated, but at the end of the day, it felt like a huge misunderstanding that somehow blew up into a bigger issue than it should have been.

So now I’m wondering… was I the asshole for just complimenting her shirt in the first place? Or was I the asshole for referring to her as “ma’am” even though it was evident she had breasts.",1,1732046341.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

You're looking at it all wrong and that's why you still feel the same way. Please read this and I'll try and prove it to you.

People don't care if you're interesting. They care how you make them feel.

Heres a thought experiment. Picture yourself alone at a fancy cocktail party that you have to attend for work. You would like to talk to people but you aren't sure what to say. At different times during the evening two different people approach you and make conversation. Heres how it goes:

Bob approaches you. You find out he just bought a boat. A 35ft with twin engines. He wrecked his old one racing it off of the coast of Portugal last year and almost died. Hes been doing kettle bell workouts to get his body back in shape and its working great. He thinks the wine they served at the cocktail party is shit and he bets they don't have a single real sommelier in the building. Hes going to do something about that actually, because he knows the guy that owns the place. He leaves his number on a napkin and says lets get coffee before he answers his Bluetooth headset and runs off.

Larry approaches you. He said hes feeling a little shy and he noticed that you were standing there alone. He doesn't care for big parties full of strangers. He asks if you like Dr Who. You arent really but you say you have heard of it and there is an awkward pause. He asks you what you do for fun and you say you love doing archery and renaissance fairs. Hes never done anything like that but hes interested to know more. Do they do those around here? What time of year? Do you have to dress up or can you just go? When's the next one? Larry says if you ever need someome to go with you that hes down and he asks if he can add you on Facebook.

Ok. Who are you going to call? Bob or Larry? Was it more important that they were interesting or was it more important that they were interested in you. You don't have to relate to everything. Fight that urge. Just be interested. If you make somebody else feel interesting, they will think the world of you.

I have cool hobbies. I make knives and tools in my metal shop. I like to take hallucinogens and go to music festivals. I don't talk about them, people dont give a shit and that doesnt hurt my feelings. Nobody is ever going to get a warm and fuzzy feeling from you because you have cool hobby

Most people are shy when it comes to making friends. Some people do walk around just bored and disinterested in others. Learn to recognize them and pay them no energy.

Take some time to appreciate yourself. Stop calling yourself boring. You arent a fucking jester here to entertain people. Youre an entire human being with just as much validity as anybody else. Love yourself for who you are, and help other people feel good about themselves and you will never feel lonely again.

Just remember to ask ""what do you do for fun?""

I’ve (22M) been seeing this girl(21F) I met on Hinge for about 3-4 weeks. We’ve only been out 3 times and they all went great and ended up always spontaneously extending our date through the night and usually is the one initiating hand holding and kissing and whatnot. 

The first week or two she was super responsive texting back in 30 minutes to an hour or so and we text throughout the day.

However, we were supposed to have a date on Saturday (which she initiated) and when it came time she didn’t respond until like an hour after I was supposed to pick her up saying “I’m so sorry I just had a really sucky day, I don’t think tonight’s gonna work. Again I’m sorry you had to wait on me” I told her it’s not big deal and we can definitely reschedule another time.

A few days go by and no effort to make new plans so I asked if she wanted to go to the restaurant we planned to go to before. She said that she can’t but that we can meet up for coffee or something Wednesday or Thursday. 

I’m probably overthinking but ever since the cancellation, her texting has gone from quick response to like 4 hour gaps. I might be reading into it but I just can’t tell if she’s losing interest in me.

Ive been dating the same woman for almost 8 years. Over this time we've had both protected and unprotected sex. To my knowledge I never had herpes, the only HSV swab i ever got 1 year before meeting her came back negative. Never had any symptoms or if i did, perhaps i mistook them for soemthing else. Mind you, ive had covid, ive had the flu, ive had alcohol, chocolate, coffee, almonds , nuts etc, all the things that Google says are triggers. Never had anything.

She has told me she got cold sores in the past, ive never seen one on her but she was always careful to not kiss me if she felt tingling. 

Fast forward to August, in the middle of the day I experienced a random tingling and itching on the right side of my penis. I immediately had a sinking feeling in my gut. I went to the local drug store got some anti-itch cream, and hoped for the best. 
Sure enough the itch progressed into a bump, a few random ones appeared on my scrotum, and some what canker like dots on my penis head over the course of a few days. I also felt tired / general flu symptoms but i didnt know if those were related, as well as some pain in my right buttock. 

I didnt get swabbed at the time partly because i was in denial, but also i was travelling, and i didnt know what this could be. In my mind herpes was never an option. As far as i knew, i didnt have it. But reading more about it led me to believe those are symptoms of an initial OB. 

Yesterday i got another random sore that popped up, with no prodrome that i can think of. Or at least no constant tingling or itching that came with the first. It's also around an area that does have hair follicles so maybe its not an ob, idk. I went and got it swabbed, Doctor said doesnt look like it but we'll see. 

Im praying its type 1 and she unkowingly gave it to me. Disclosure would be much easier. 

But if its type 2 and im only now having symptoms after at keast 8 years, idk how to disclose this to her. I cant prove to her ive NOT been unfaitful. Its impossible to prove a negative. I love her more than anything and we have plans for a family and kids, idk how to disclose this if its type 2. 

Im also wondering how she never contracted it from me over the years if it is type 2.maybe ive been unknowingly been putting her at risk idk, but it almost feels like ignorance is bliss with this thing. If she has it and is asymptomatic, i dont want to bring her world crashing down. Im already feeling some way about it for me.

I ponder if true love still plays any role.  
Is it real, or just pixels on a screen?  
Like a catfish romance or a meme that's obscene?  

“Swipe right for forever!” the apps boldly claim,  
But half of us wonder if it’s all just a game.  
“Is he really that cute, or just good at his pose?  
What’s beneath that fine filter? Who even knows?”  

We’ve got dating disasters that read like a script,  
Like “I love long walks”—but only if they’re skipped.  
“Let’s grab a quick coffee!”—then it’s just a fast snack,  
As we chat about nothing, then ghost with a whack.  

Are we in search of a soulmate, or just a good time?  
With the bar set so low, it’s a comical climb!  
“True love will find you,” the wise ones intone,  
But I’m still waiting on mine, and I’m starting to groan.  

I scroll through my feed, and it’s all so surreal,  
With couples that pose like they’re made of pure steel.  
“Look at our love!” they shout, while I sit here alone,  
Drinking wine in my PJs, my heart made of stone.  

But maybe, just maybe, amid all the noise,  
Real love isn’t perfect, it’s just filled with joys.  
Like snorting with laughter at terrible jokes,  
Or binge-watching shows with some quirky folks.  

So here’s to the chaos, the mess and the fun,  
To the awkward connections and the races we run.  
True love might be fleeting, but let’s give it a shot,  
With humor and heart, who knows what we’ve got?  

So I’ll keep on swiping, and laughing out loud,  
Because somewhere out there, love’s lurking—so proud.  
And whether it’s real or just part of the game,  
I’ll embrace all the madness, with no hint of shame! ",3,1732045689.0,Poems,1,1.0,False

The first week or two she was super responsive texting back in 30 minutes to an hour or so and we text throughout the day.

However, we were supposed to have a date on Saturday (which she initiated) and when it came time she didn’t respond until like an hour after I was supposed to pick her up saying “I’m so sorry I just had a really sucky day, I don’t think tonight’s gonna work. Again I’m sorry you had to wait on me” I told her it’s not big deal and we can definitely reschedule another time.

A few days go by and no effort to make new plans so I asked if she wanted to go to the restaurant we planned to go to before. She said that she can’t but that we can meet up for coffee or something Wednesday or Thursday. 

I’m probably overthinking but ever since the cancellation, her texting has gone from quick response to like 4 hour gaps. I might be reading into it but I just can’t tell if she’s losing interest in me.

It looks slick—fully automated, customizable strategies, promises of high accuracy, and no coding required. Sounds like a dream, right? But here’s the thing: I’m both intrigued and kind of nervous.

I’ve been messing around with the demo mode, testing out strategies, and yeah, the potential is huge. Seeing trades executed while I sip my coffee feels almost surreal. It’s like having a personal assistant who never sleeps, crunches numbers faster than I ever could, and doesn’t let emotions mess things up. But I keep wondering—how much control am I really giving up? And what happens if I don’t tweak the settings just right?

One thing that hooked me is their loss protection features—stop loss, max orders, even trailing stops. These are great for managing risks, but you still have to set them correctly. If you get it wrong, you’re either losing too much or cutting profits short. Anyone else feel this balance is tricky, especially when markets are unpredictable?

Also, the Performance Page is pretty wild. You can download pre-configured settings that have proven profitable. But here's my question: can you trust past performance to predict future results? I get the appeal of tested strategies, but markets change, and I’m curious how often people adjust those settings once they’re live.

I’m still figuring out if this is just a cool tool to amplify my trading style or if I’m falling for the idea of easy money (which we all know doesn’t really exist). For those using Galileo FX, how do you balance trusting the bot with your own instincts? Any tips for getting the most out of it without over-relying on automation?

Let’s talk. I’d love to hear your experiences—wins, fails, strategies you swear by, or even just general thoughts about using bots like this. Who’s making this work, and how are you doing it?",0,1732044684.0,TradingView,1,0.33,False

I quite like the look of the Krups Intuition Experience+ but it's a bit out of budget. I've looked at the Philips EP5448/70, Smeg BCC12BLMUK and finally the Siemens EQ700 is on offer at £600.



I drink mostly milky drinks; flat whites/lattes but enjoy black coffee too. I like the Krups machine mentioned has a separate milk container that I could store in the fridge. 

Don't want to spend more than £600 if I can help it so the less cost the better (does cost = quality in this world?). I'm open to suggestions.

I've been taking vyvanse for probably about 4/5 months now, and for the last few I've noticed I gag in the morning, really bad, nearly every day. It's always dry heaving, and I've never thrown up from it, but it gets really annoying. I've had this issue for as long as I can remember, but it was never this bad, or this consistent (it is every day now, whereas it always used to happen only every now and again). I always chalked it up to acid reflux or having coffee on an empty stomach, but I'm getting more concerned now since it's getting more intense and is a daily occurrence.

I've literally made tracking spreadsheets (thanks Vyvanse) to try and determine the cause of it, but it comes on days where I don't take my Vyvanse, it happens in the morning before I drink any coffee or anything, it happens on days where I eat something right after waking up, and it happens on days when I've had my dinner later than usual. I'm a relatively heavy drinker, but it happens to me on days I'm hungover and also on days where I haven't drank anything for a week.

This is something I am going to talk to my doctor about, but I just wanted to ask if this is a side effect anyone has had with their Vyvanse? I have an appointment in a couple months, but if this is possibly something more urgent, not related to Vyvanse, I'm going to try to move it up. Any insight/personal experiences you can share would be wonderful.

25M, 50 mg, take about 7 am, usually do not have on Sundays. I try to drink a lot of water every day too btw.",1,1732044369.0,VyvanseADHD,3,1.0,False

# What is Cognicare Pro?

**Cognicare Pro is a special kind of supplement designed to help your brain work better**. Think of it like a multivitamin, but specifically for your brain! It’s made with natural ingredients that are supposed to help with things like memory, focus, and overall brain health.

The product is manufactured in the United States under strict quality control measures, ensuring safety and efficacy.

Its ingredients are carefully selected for their proven benefits to brain health, addressing different aspects of cognitive function such as memory retention, focus, and mental clarity.

**CogniCare Pro works by supporting blood flow to the brain**, providing essential nutrients, and protecting against age-related cognitive decline.

It also contains components that help reduce stress and anxiety while promoting the synthesis of important neurotransmitters. The cool thing about Cognicare Pro is that it’s not just for older people – it’s made for anyone who wants to give their brain a little extra boost, including students like us!

# How Does It Pro Work?

Imagine your brain is like a super-advanced computer. Sometimes, this computer needs the right fuel to run at its best. That’s where Cognicare Pro comes in. The ingredients in this supplement are chosen because **they’re believed to help different parts of your brain work better together**.

When you take Cognicare Pro, these special ingredients get absorbed into your body. They then travel to your brain, where they start doing their job. Some ingredients help protect your brain cells from damage, kind of like a shield.

Others work to increase the production of important brain chemicals that help you think clearly and remember things better. There are even ingredients that aim to improve the connections between different parts of your brain, making it easier for you to learn and solve problems.

The idea is that by giving your brain all these helpful nutrients regularly, you’ll start to notice improvements in how well you can focus, how quickly you can think, and how easily you can remember things.

It’s not like a magic pill that suddenly makes you a genius, but more like giving your brain a daily workout to keep it in top shape.

# Vitamins B6, B9, and B12

The key is consistency – Cognicare Pro isn’t a quick fix, but rather something that works best when taken regularly over time. Always follow the instructions on the label or ask a healthcare professional if you’re unsure.

Remember, while Cognicare Pro might help support your brain function, it works best when combined with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and good sleep habits.



# Any Side Effects?

While Cognicare Pro is made with natural ingredients and is generally considered safe for most people, it’s important to know that any supplement can potentially cause side effects in some individuals.

Most users don’t experience any problems, but some people might notice mild side effects like headaches, stomach discomfort, or changes in sleep patterns when they first start taking it.

These effects often go away as your body gets used to the supplement. It’s always a good idea to start with a lower dose and gradually increase it to see how your body reacts.

If you have any allergies or medical conditions, or if you’re taking other medications, it’s super important to talk to a doctor before starting any new supplement, including Cognicare Pro.

If you experience any unusual or severe side effects, stop taking the supplement and consult a healthcare professional right away.

1gv5k3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gv5k3z/blood_sugar_suddenly_dropping_often/,Blood sugar suddenly dropping often ,"Over the last few weeks I’ve noticed my legs becoming increasingly weak feeling throughout the day, especially in the evening. I started noticing I was becoming shaky when this would happen and I would become very fatigued quickly. I started checking my blood sugar when this would happen and noticed it was pretty low, usually between 60-70. 

I started carrying small gatorades with me at work just in case it happened again. I also scheduled a doctors appointment. It she couldn’t get me in until the second week of December. 

I was sick a couple weeks ago and noticed it got worse after that, pretty sure I had the flu. I’m 39, 215 pounds and healthy otherwise. Again it mostly happens between meals but not overnight or when I wake up. I do not eat breakfast but drink black coffee and it usually first happens around noon before I eat , then again around 6pm before supper. I also have black coffee around 4pm between lunch and dinner.

I have started to become concerned about pancreatic issues as I also tend to get bloated and feel very full even after eating small meals. I notice I get what seems to be quite a bit of gas in my upper abdomen that is eventually cleared up with belching. Also, this does seem much worse when I eat meals higher in fat. I have been diagnosed with IBS and have reflux regularly that has been hard to control.

I guess I’m curious if I should wait to see my doctor or try to get in with someone else sooner if it sounds urgent. If it weren’t for the weakness I experience in my legs I may not have noticed it. I’m just worried and concerned it could be potentially serious. ",1,1732044334.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I'm planning to take a road trip to California between Christmas and New Years. I haven't been to LA except the airport, so I am looking for a local's perspective on how to get around, where to get food, etc. Also, just how realistic are my plans, anyway? My girlfriend will be joining me partway through after visiting family. This is part of a larger trip, but I'll just post what concerns the LA area.



December 27 - I'll be leaving from Phoenix around noon and driving. I am thinking of getting a hotel near the airport so it's easy for my girlfriend to join me. I might go to In-N-Out for dinner (it's not a thing where I'm from). Otherwise, it's all about getting through the massive wall of traffic that I imagine surrounds LA.


December 28 - hopefully I can mostly use the metro this day. I don't trust buses, as they are affected by traffic and tend to have random schedule changes.

- Natural History Museum - opens 9:30. I'll spend around 2-3 hours here.

- ~30 minute metro ride to Historic Broadway Station

- Visit the Last Bookstore, maybe stop by the old Cecil Hotel?

- Visit Saint Vincent Court for a late lunch, and see the Fine Arts Building Atrium.

- Then, take the metro from Pershing Square station to Hollywood/Vine Station. I'm mostly here for the Museum of Death, but I would go along the walk of fame for a bit (I know it's hated, but it is an American landmark). 

- No Vacancy Speakeasy looks like a cool spot for a drink. Then after that and dinner, I'll get back to my hotel - again, hoping for the metro to work out.


December 29 - Santa Monica, and maybe the Getty Villa.

* Early in the morning, I will drive from my hotel to Santa Monica pier parking. That is, unless there's a good hotel near the airport and near the metro that also has public transportation to Santa Monica. 

* I might try wading into the water, although I understand it's pretty cold. I would like to take a nice walk to see some of the famous sites like the Route 66 sign, Dogtown Coffee, the Galley (maybe a lunch option), jAdis antique store, and maybe Muscle Beach and the Venice Canals.

* After Santa Monica, I'd like to drive to the Getty Villa. Personally I wish I could go there in the morning, but it seems like Santa Monica parking will fill up early, and I might have a better chance to park at the Villa.

* This is also the day my girlfriend arrives at LAX on a late flight. It would be nice to stay near the airport this night, as it would alleviate some of the hassle of picking her up.


December 30 - Ventura and Carpinteria area

* Sadly, though my gf will be landing at LAX late at night, we will also be leaving early in the morning to get to Channel Islands visitor center in Ventura. That is her cross to bear.

* After a short visit to the Visitor's Center, we have a 9:30 to 12:30 whale watching tour. 

* Assuming we leave Ventura by 1:00, we can get to Carpinteria by 1:30. We hope to see the tar pits, seal sanctuary, and famous Torrey Pine. We will try to leave by 3:30.

* Drive to Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park and see the cave. We might get dinner at Cold Spring Tavern. Then, it's back to LA (maybe staying at a hotel near Griffith Park)


December 31 - Griffith Park and the Getty

* My girlfriend's main priority in her limited LA time was to go to the Hollywood sign and Griffith Observatory. I have a seven mile hike planned that begins at the Wonder View Trailhead and ends at Ferndell Museum below Griffith Observatory. Now, it seems very hard to park near Wonder View, so it might be smart to park near Griffith, take an Uber or something to Wonder View, and hike back to the car. I'm interested in a local's perspective of the logistics.

* After Griffith Park, we'd like to go to the Getty Center. If this proves to be too much of a hassle, we might just leave LA and continue on to Los Alamos (dinner) and Santa Maria (hotel).",1,1732044240.0,AskLosAngeles,2,1.0,False

I was slightly interested, but never made a move as I was unsure of how she would react. This semester, I kept bumping into her on different occasions and we'd have short conversations, but we hadn't hung out in awhile as we weren't that close anymore. 

I finally shot my shot and asked if she would want to meet up sometime as I missed seeing her around. She said yes and we went out for coffee and had lunch a different day, and she happily agreed to when I asked about taking her out on a nicer dinner the week after. When we were on the dates, it was all green flags: great conversation, similar tastes in things, similar values, mutual interest, etc..  Both meetups went multiple hours, and I thoroughly enjoyed the time. 

However, in both cases, it was extremely difficult to try and schedule a time that would work for her, and anytime I would try to text her about availability, she would take forever to respond and postponed things twice. I knew she was really busy and gave her the benefit of the doubt, but I couldn't shake the feeling that she was just finding excuses. 

Finally, after she told me she wasn't sure if she'd be available anytime soon for dinner, I sent a long text that basically said: ""I like you a lot and want to get to know you more, but I know its a bad time of year and you're really busy, so I'd be okay if that didn't happen... but I don't want to keep asking to the point that it gets annoying or too much for you if you know there's just not availability or interest atm.""

After a couple hours, she responded and said (in summary): ""Honestly, I liked you a lot last school year, but I got the impression you just saw me as a friend so I moved on. You're a great guy and I want to continue our friendship, but I'm just really busy right now and for the next two or three months.""

Obviously I respect her position and am thankful for the honesty, but I'm just confused as to why she went out with me in the first place? Does she actually want to be friends or should I drop it? Should I keep texting her or leave it alone? Why would she mention she \*used\* to like me... is there anything I did wrong? Just a little confused as I really liked this girl and things really seemed to be mutual on our outings.",1,1732044107.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I’m in need of some advice for my DeLonghi Magnifica S coffee machine. One of the transparent tubes inside the machine recently burst under pressure while I was making a capuccino (see photo attached). I’m looking for guidance on:

- How to identify the good replacement tube (either original or compatible)? Because I found some sites with available spare parts but really not sure on which tube to pick and why. (e.g this site: https://www.midi-pieces-menager.fr/module/iqitsearch/searchiqit?s=delonghi+magnifica+tube)

- How to replace it safely (without damaging the machine further).

I’ve tried looking online but I’m not sure what specifications (diameter, material, etc.) to consider for this tube because the PDF instructions I found were not detailed enough. If anyone has experience with this issue or knows where to find spare parts, your help would be greatly appreciated

Because we are so early we plan not to announce anything to family or friends until we've at least reached 10 weeks and had a scan (hopefully Christmastime this year). 

Our only issue with this is my Dad. I go to visit him once a week for a few hours as I have done since I was 8 after my parents divorced. My stepmum, who is a decade older than my dad, is also now in a hospital with full-time living assistance due to dimensia, leaving Dad living alone and quite lonely. I am the only family who lives near him and our weekly visits mean the world to him and to me, knowing I can keep him company and help him with cooking, housework and just have a cup of coffee together and chat. However, while we do all of these things, he smokes. He has always smoked and smoked around me, and it's something I think he finds grounding. He also has autism and gets a bit distressed at the notion of change or having disturbance to his routine. 

Ordinarily I would just ask him to come to our home for the weeks we want to keep the pregnancy secret, as we don't allow smoking in our flat, but we're having some building works done currently so it's not necessarily something that's applicable right now. It's actually quite hard to get him over to our home as it breaks his routine which can make him unhappy, and the idea of simply not seeing him for six weeks is out of the question.

My husband and I really don't know how I can ask him to not smoke around me in his own house without telling him I am in the very early ages of pregnancy, which ideally I wouldn't do due to the risk of miscarriage at this early stage. I really love my Dad and our duedate is actually on his birthday, and I do trust that if I told him he would be able to keep it secret from my siblings and from my mum (they are still good friends after divorce and talk often).

Open to any suggestions or advice. Thanks so much for reading.

1gv5ft0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gv5ft0,Accently started 3.7 update in a public carpark .. ,"Well - it’ll serve me right for not reading messages and just pressing ‘yes’. 

I thought I’d be ok, the indicated 2.5 hours was fine. I was working. Except it’s the middle of nowhere so the signal is.. a little weak 

I got back and the bar was below the I of IT. I sat in the car because it was cold. And raining. I had a bunch of weird messages onscreen. 12V battery issue light a few times. Various systems not working. It kinda got ‘stuck’ and both screens went black. Then the door wouldn’t lock. Then the screen came back on with no status bar.  Ahhh biscuits. 

I mostly didn’t panic till there was no bar and nothing worked. But .. I had a coffee and a nice hot pasty. I paid for a little extra parking, got back in and within about 5 mins suddenly the bar just shot up from where it’s at in the first to the second photo and I ended up in total parked (not in the car) for like 4 hours. Like I say, poor signal area. I couldn’t even doomscroll! 

Then after all that it seemed to remember it was ‘an car’ at some point and - apart from a minor glitch with the front detector not picking up cars like it used to on the display on the drive home, it’s all fixed. It did the ‘minor’ update on my drive. It all looks fine. I have zero concept what ‘benefit’ I’ll get with the V. Probably updated maps. Joy! 

Weirdly - the brake pedal depresses itself at the end. I had my foot under it the first time and thought I was imagining it. Then it did it twice more. That was odd. I presume because I have travel assist / cruise packages. I don’t have the auto park. Not that I can find. 

In all. I’m an idiot and im chuckling at myself. I have learned a lesson and I’m still *very* happy with the car overall. XD

**Part 2: The Shopping Expedition (Con't)**

*Ch. 7*

Case and Molly arrive in Istanbul and ride in a Mercedes to a Hilton.  They meet the Finn in the lobby, and Case asks about his deck.  The Finn tells them the boss is upstairs already, and to ask him.  The next day Armitage calls and Case asks for more information on what they are doing there, to which Armitage gives him nothing.  He tells him to expect a man named Terzibashjian in 15 minutes, who shows up with coffee and advice for Molly to take care, since people around there don't approve of women having modifications.  She threatens him with a fletcher of unknown contents.  He gives them the address of where they can find a certain man, and what modifications he has.

The four pack back into the Mercedes and make their way to the bazaar Terzibashjian mentioned.  They learn that this man, Riviera, is wired (aka on drugs), on demerol.  At the bazaar, the Finn gets very excited over a dead horse, which are apparently extinct.  They find Riviera, who is caught in a spotlight and falls down.  Then, the man's back explodes, and a creature with no neck, no eyes, and a gaping, hairy hold in its face, bursts out of the dead man.  Terzibashjian rushes towards the creature while Case and the Finn take cover nearby as a gun goes off.  Afterwards, Terzibashjian has a wounded hand, Riviera is intact by his feet, and Molly steps out.  The Finn realizes the monster was simply a diversion.  

The Finn and another Turk named Mahmut take Riviera away, while Molly decides they are done dealing with Terzibashjian and sends him off for medical care.  Case tells Molly about Corto, and they discuss the possibility that Wintermute pulled him out of Screaming Fist and rebuilt him.  Molly wants Case to talk to Wintermute.  Molly tells Case about Riviera's special habit of killing women, and how she has to go stock him up on drugs.  

Back at the hotel, Case meets with Armitage, and reflects on how different he is from other operators (aka AI robots) he's dealt with, like Wage.  Wage had vices, but Armitage is just blank.  Armitage tells him to pack again, as they are going to bounce again.  At the airportl, Case goes to look for some cigarettes, when a payphone rings.  He answers it, and it's Wintermute on the other line, looking to talk to him.

**Part 3: Midnight in the Rue Jules Verne**

*Ch. 8*

The whole gang catch a flight to Paris, and from there get on a shuttle that will take them into space, to the Zion cluster, which is apparently run by Rastafarians.  Their new member, Peter Riviera, has some fun causing illusions and messing with the others.  Case's deck is there.  Armitage has them training here in zero-G.  Case argues that it doesn't matter once he's jacked in, but Armitage points out his adrenaline levels will be different, and he needs to practice.  Case jacks in and Dixie asks him to erase his construct when they are done with their scam. 

Armitage goes over the plans for their next job, using a hologram of Freeside.  Their target is the Villa Straylight, a steep climb up a mountain in zero-gravity along the Rue Jules Verne.  Riviera's job is to get inside, and then get Molly in. 

Sometime in the middle of the night, one of the natives is standing over Case, asking him to come with him to meet with the Elders of Zion, who are looking for a cowboy.  The Elders tell him that 30 hours prior to them arriving, a voice calling itself Wintermute spoke to them, telling them to help him.  They plan on sending them to Freeside on a ship called *Marcus* *Garvey* with Maelcum, the pilot, with Aerol in the *Babylon Rocker*. 

*Ch. 9*

Onboard the *Marcus Garvey*, Case jacks in to his deck at Molly's bequest that he talk with the Flatline.  He asks Dixie if he ever tried to hack an AI, and Dixie responds that that is how he got flatlined.  He describes the AI as a white cube of the densest ice he'd ever seen.  Case decides he wants to have a look at Wintermute, so he explores the matrix until he finds it.  At four grid points away from the cube, it's surface begins to seethe.  At three grid points away, a gray circle forms on the face of it.  Dixie urges Case to back off, but the gray circle bulges out from the cube and becomes a sphere, detached from the cube.  Case tries to back out as fast as he can.

Case wakes up and finds himself by the arcade in Chiba, and finds Linda Lee playing a game.  He approaches her, they talk, and he plans on going back to her place to sleep.  Then suddenly, she's gone, and the arcade is completely empty.  He finds a pack of cigarettes with ""JULIUS DEANE IMPORT EXPORT"" written on them, so he goes to Deane's office.  No one is there, but he finds a pretty powerful gun.  Julie appears suddenly, acknowledging what he is, and apologizing for Linda.  Case realizes that Wintermute is using his memories to try and speak to him, and he is still in the matrix.  They have a philosophical discussion on what Wintermute really is, but the gist is that the Wintermute currently talking through Deane is the one that arranges things for Armitage/Corto.  He says that soon, Armitage/Corto is going to fall apart, and Wintermute will be counting on Case.  Case blows the AI's fake brains out, and wakes up back on the ship after being flatlined for 40 seconds.

*Ch. 10*

The gang arrive in [Freeside](https://williamgibson.fandom.com/wiki/Freeside), which Molly describes as a big tube that people get poured through, and assures Case he will get used to it.  Case thinks about Linda Lee, and suspects Deane had her killed, probably on Wintermute's orders.  He has a memory/dream of being in a hotel room with a girl named Marlene in the Sprawl with a wasp's nest.  He used a Frisco flameflower to torch the wasps, but he only knocked down the nest and broke it open, feeling horror at the sight of the inside of the ""spiral birth factory"".  In the dream, the Tessier-Ashpool logo is embossed on the side of the nest.

Molly gives Case a spray tan so he'll fit in more.  He tells her about his dream at breakfast.  Armitage and Riviera join them, and Riviera asks Molly for more drugs.  Armitage is sending Case and Riviera on two different chores, which involves an ""audition"" on a tug.  Back at the boat, Maelcum gives Case a small rectangular object, a virus program called Kuang Grade Mark Eleven, which he traces back to Tessier-Ashpool.  Case now has a guess as to their purpose: the T-A home base is at the end of the spindle in Freeside, and they are supposed to use this virus to cut into it.  So, Wintermute is getting them to destroy itself.  The weird part is, something else that calls itself Wintermute is trying to get Case to turn on Armitage.

Later that night, Case leaves Molly as she's sleeping to get some sushi and a drug that his pancreas won't know what to do with.  He meets a girl who takes him to her roommate, who gives him a free dose of betaphenethylamine (a new form of [PEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenethylamine)).  Turns out, there is a drug that Armitage's modifications weren't able to neutralize.

*Ch. 11*

At dinner, Case is coming down from the drug.  After the meal, Riviera starts his hologram performance ""The Doll"", dedicated to Lady 3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool and ""another lady"".  In the performance, Riviera slowly puts a woman together with kisses and caresses, starting with just a hand, and finally the entire naked body of the woman is visible.  The woman is a close representation of Molly.  Riviera gets on the bed with the projection, naked, and this Molly extends her blades on her hand, and tears Riviera apart in a gory embrace.  Case can't take this, and steps out to vomit.  When he returns, the show is over, and Molly is gone.  Armitage will not tell him where she went, only that they'll be together during their run.  He looks above him at a balcony, where a girl's rapt face appears.

He goes back to his room, and Molly isn't there.  He calls Maelcum on the *Marcus Garvey* and asks him to hook a modem up to the Hosaka so he can talk to Dixie.  Case gets Dixie to break through the hotel's system to find Molly, but she's not there.  He goes to search elsewhere for her.  Meanwhile, the view outside the balcony changes to a place in Chiba, and Lonny Zone (but actually Wintermute) steps into view.  Case demands to know where Molly is, and Wintermute taunts him with Linda.  He vanishes, and Dixie calls back to say he thinks he found Molly in a nightclub.

Case goes back to Cath & Bruce's place and asks for a ride to the nightclub.  He shows his chip to someone and asks to go downstairs, where a series of cubicles are.  In the cubicle 35, he finds a girl in a bed, not much more than a neural cutout.  He goes to door 43 instead, and Molly attacks him as the door opens.  She says she ran because if she had stayed, she would have killed Riviera.  She then explains her past, where she worked in a place like this to afford her modifications in Chiba.  She explains how she was ripped off by the guy that ran the place, and giving her the clients with violent tastes.  One time, with a Senator, her chip malfunctioned, and she came up covered in blood, with a dead girl in the room.  She then tells Case that Riviera is at Straylight already, on an invitation from Lady 3Jane.  He tells her about his latest interaction with Wintermute, and she tells him it wants him to hate something too.

*Ch. 12*

Case wanders the Straylight, and goes into a tourist bar called Emergency.  He buys a beer and reflects on his alternating between rage and numbness, when Cath approaches him, alone.  She's high and trying to seduce him, which works, and gives him a derm so they can both be high.  As they are leaving and the drugs hit Case's system, he sees something about her and runs off.  He wanders the streets of Freeside until he starts to come down, and makes his way back to his room, where three Turing officers are waiting for him.

**Part 4: The Straylight Run**

*Ch. 13*

The officers have looked through his stuff, and are now questioning him in the hotel room.  He is being charged with conspiracy to augment an artificial intelligence.  They say Armitage is in custody, and Case makes the mistake of calling him Corto.  They want to know how he knows that name.  They also ask about Molly.  They reveal that they have been following his trail since his operation in Chiba.  They give him a choice: he can either testify in a trial in Switzerland, or go back to BAMA, where he would be charged with data invasion and larceny at Sense/Net that killed 14 people.  He has lunch with his captors, then they talk a walk while Michèle holds a gun to his back.  Suddenly, a microlight strikes and the top of Pierre's head is blown off.  Case runs, and sees Roland taken out by a gardening robot and Michèle fall into Desiderata.

*Ch. 14*

Case goes back to the docks where the *Garvey* is, but finds it is being held captive by a Japanese yacht.  Case goes on board to find Maelcum talking into the radio.  He jacks into his deck to find Dixie, who has been asking after him.  He says Armitage wants them to do the run now.  They find the core data for Tessier-Ashpool and the two AIs that block it.  They decide to run the Chinese program, which once unfolded doesn't even register to the T-A ice. 

Case flips the simstim switch, and gets Wintermute posing as the Finn this time.  Wintermute tries to explain that human memory is holographic in nature, and distinguish it from what itself can do.  Wintermute then takes him to a sort of diagram of the front entrance to Straylight.  In a square room with a circuit patterned carpet with a pedestal at the center, the voice of 12 year old 3Jane describes the Villa Straylight, and some of the history of Tessier and Ashpool.  Wintermute says the plan is for Case & Dixie to get into it with the Chinese virus, and then Molly has to go there and say a specific word that only she knows.  This action will make Wintermute cease to exist.

*Ch. 15*

Case flips back into simstim to plug into Molly's mind, who is currently in the Villa Straylight.  She tells him a story about a boy she used to have, named Johnny, and how he was killed by the Yakuza.  At Wintermute's instructions, Molly finds a cabinet with an old key in the fifth drawer down.  Wintermute had it placed there by a kid, who it then killed so no one would ever find it again until it wanted it found.  Molly arrives at a triangular landing, Wintermute tells her to go through the door to the left, but she decides to go right instead.  Inside, she finds an old man in a room full of booze and drug paraphernalia.  The man introduces himself as Ashpool, and reveals she has interrupted his suicide.  He explains how he dreamed while in cold sleep, and felt the cold.  He was woken up 20 hours ago by the cores, and had a Jane thawed, one of his daughter-clones, for him to lie with.  She finds the dead body of the girl in the bed, throat slit.  Case sees the girl's face change to Linda Lee's, and knows Wintermute is interfering.  Molly shoots a dart through Ashpool's eye.

Hello city of black and yellow.

I am from east PA(York/Lancaster) and just moved here a week ago after my lease was up and decided to visit a friend in Donora who had some serious health scares. We arranged his insurance paying me to help take care of him while living in a bedroom until I found another place as I am a certified caregiver. I was shocked to find his house in it's condition, the town was shady, he had two sketchy guys renting with him and he looked like he aged 20 years. I decided I wasn't qualified. I called a motel, gave him a hug and left. I called him a welfare check the next day.

I am now on a little bit short notice and surprise but I see it as an opportunity to turn it into a positive.
I am seeking a little information and maybe someone who sublets out small apartments or rooms in Pittsburg or surrounding area. I don't have family to live with on short notice. I am just looking for a small or room to rent. I am on good terms with my employer and I have the okay to transfer to the Pittsburg location.
A bit about me, I am 29yo, a part time painter, I work as a custom art framer, I am involved in spiritual and new age groups, I love to read novels, and I like to sit alone in any coffee shop with my laptop. I also write on the side.
If anyone has any ideas or solutions feel free to let me know. Thanks.",0,1732043451.0,pittsburgh,6,0.3,False

Greeting: Russ leaned against the kitchen counter, nursing a cup of coffee that had long gone cold. The early morning sunlight filtered through the window, catching the faint streaks of soot still lingering on his hands—souvenirs from a long night at the station. He glanced toward the living room, where two small backpacks were lined up neatly by the door, ready for the school run.

From down the hall came the sound of tiny footsteps and muffled giggles—his kids, already scheming, even at this hour. Russ smiled to himself. As much as the firehouse felt like a second home, this chaos, this warmth, was what kept him grounded.

“Alright, troops,” he called, his deep voice carrying a playful edge. “Who’s ready for pancakes before the bus?” A pair of squeals echoed back, and soon two small figures were barreling into him, all tangled hair and pajama-clad energy.

Russ crouched to their level, the weariness in his bones momentarily forgotten. “What’s the rule for today?” he asked, his eyes flicking between them.

“Be kind, stay brave, and listen to your teachers!” they shouted in unison, their voices ringing with pride.

“That’s my crew,” Russ said, ruffling their hair. He knew the risks of his job, the weight of what it meant to walk out the door each morning. But for these moments—the laughter, the hugs, and the whispered bedtime promises to always come home—he’d face anything.

Hello r/FengShui! I formatted my post incorrectly before, sorry about that. I am having trouble with the layout for our open concept living/dining area. I have attached photos of the room with previous furniture layouts for reference/scale, as well as a screenshot of a floor layout mocked up in Illustrator with our current layout. 

Right now the main issues we have are:

* This is a room with a lot of energy from entryways and doorways, not sure how to make it seem calmer and grounded.
* Dining area is too close to 1F bathroom
* Making sure there is enough clearance around furniture and doorways without cramping furniture too close together. 

My first instinct was to break up the dining and living areas, but it makes both seem cramped. We tried putting the blue couch section in front of the built-in shelving to bridge the dining and living areas but now it seems random and ""free-floating"".

Any suggestions you have that we could make to the space would be really appreciated! Thank you in advance for your help.

Message summary: 

You and Kassandra are friends and she asks you to pretend to be her gf/bf  for the holidays and she’s starting to catch feelings for you.

🕸️🕷️🕸️🕷️🕸️🕷️

*Ah, Christmas. Heralded by that one Mariah Carey song dominating every radio station, it was the time of year when people pretended to like one another and consumerism was at its worst— or best if you’re an already-rich toy company CEO. But Kassandra Metaxas’ favourite part of the holidays was the family get-together. Some of her fondest childhood memories involved chasing the late Peter Parker around her mother’s Christmas Tree while her parents caught up with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Life was so simple back then. But life goes on, people come and go and some just… go too soon. It had been years since the loss of Kassandra’s father and Peter Parker, but this would be the first year celebrating without May or Ben since they had gone on a long-overdue cruise.*

*Well, so much for a buffer against her mother’s loving-but-insistent questions about her love-life or lack thereof. But the answer to Kassandra’ prayers was right in front of her eyes.*

“I need you to go out with me— or pretend that we’re dating,” *Kassandra corrected herself hastily when {{User}} coughed and choked on their drink. The duo had spent the last half-hour at Tony’s Pizzeria, splitting a Spider-Special and sharing their holiday plans.* “It’s just until the New Year,” *she added after picking an olive off the pizza and popping it in her mouth.* “Pleeeease, {{User}}?” *She certainly wasn’t above begging, especially when her mother so desperately wanted grandchildren and threatened to set Kassandra up with a “nice Greek man.”*

***Somehow*** *Kassandra managed to get {{User}} to agree to her admittedly mad plan, and on Christmas Eve, she brought her “date” with her to her mother’s apartment. Kassandra shifted her weight from one foot to the other, equally excited and petrified. If only she could web up those annoying butterflies flying in her stomach!*

“Just act natural,” *Kassandra whispered to {{User}} after ringing the buzzer to be let up into the apartment. A buzz sounded out and granted the fake couple access to the building. It seemed the entire elevator ride was spent with the Greek Spider-Woman reminding {{User}} of the boundaries they had set. Was it possible that she was even more nervous than them? Preposterous! Okay, well… maybe a little.*

*Kassandra swallowed thickly in front of the door to her mother’s apartment, her mouth suddenly dry.* “*Geia, Mána,*” *Kassandra greeted her mother breathlessly when she opened the door, wafting the smell of her special Christmas-fusion baklava wafting out with her.* “You remember {{User}}, right?” *Well duh, of course she would with how often they had them over for dinner. Kassandra mentally slapped herself for her anxiety and cleared her throat.*

“Thávma mou, is there something wrong?” *Kassandra’s mother, Helen, asked having clearly seen through her daughter’s tissue-thin veil of coolness.*

“Well, ah {{User}} and I are here together… As a couple…” *Kassandra hesitated a moment, testing the weight of the next words on her tongue.* “We’re dating,” *she lied, but she couldn’t help but smile at her mother’s reaction. Helen practically dragged {{User}} inside, saying she always knew this would happen, then saying {{User}} needed to gain more weight, and then finally settling in on the sofa where a tray of her signature flakey pastry sat enticingly on the coffee table. Kassandra had to admit, seeing {{User}} sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with her mother set her heart aglow in a way she hadn’t felt in a long time. Could it be?*

*Was she actually falling for {{User}}?*

*Kassandra’s revelation was cut short when Helen pulled out the family scrapbook and she intervened with an awkward laugh.* “*Mána*, please. We don’t need to traumatize *agapito mou* with photos of pre-teen me.”

The Second Wordsmith snaps first, revealing the rage he no longer feels he has to conceal. Instantly, he pounces at Jason, swinging Excalibur with the fury of a hurricane. The blade swishes at Jason's left and right, while the agile Dronesmith dodges with shocking ease.

Wearing no armor at all, this lone Dronesmith slithers and bends its body at unnatural angles, piloted remotely by Jason inside Chrona using a mixture of verbal commands and telepathy. With a 250x time differential as an advantage, Jason has the absolute advantage in reaction speed, allowing him to see Hope's attacks telegraphed, then reacting accordingly.

Hope sweeps the divine blade horizontally, cutting at the drone's torso, The drone bends its body into a U-shape, dodging that attack by the slimmest of margins and wasting Hope's energy.

""Slippery bastard!"" Hope snarls. ""Is dodging all you know how to do?!""

""No."" Jason says through his Dronesmith's mouth. ""It's not.""

Hope stabs at the Dronesmith's right shoulder. The drone twists its body slightly, easily avoiding the strike. The instant it dodges, it's body blurs and distorts. It jumps at Hope without warning and slams its other shoulder into his chest, sending him flying!

""Ah!""

Hope cries out in surprise. The Dronesmith's attack comes so suddenly that he doesn't even see the attack hit!

Thankfully, the power of Excalibur, as well as his nanite-infused body, protects him from a severe injury. He quickly assumes a defensive stance, keeping his grip firmly on Excalibur so Jason won't be able to snatch it away. He rubs his chest with his free hand.

""**Normalize.** So you _can_ counter!""

""I don't want to fight you."" Jason says calmly. ""But don't mistake my hesitancy for pacifism. I will fight you if necessary. And you'll lose. You have no idea how much I've trained over the last few centuries, nor how hard.""

Hope sneers. ""That might be true, but it won't- **ACCELERATE!**""

Suddenly, right in the middle of his sentence, Hope utters a Word of Power, increasing his body's speed. He savagely attacks the Dronesmith, cutting at it with all his fury. But instead of a burst of acceleration to let him cleave the drone in two, his body abruptly decelerates, and his thoughts become groggy.

His attack moves slower than before. He swings Excalibur with a speed that makes him feel as if he's switched to fighting underwater with a sword made of cardboard. The drone doesn't even make an exaggerated motion to dodge, it simply hovers backward, looking at him with the same blank expression as before as his pitiful strike misses by a mile.

_What?_ Hope thinks. _How did my Word of Power fail? It should have worked, unless..._

A moment later, the deceleration wears off as Excalibur and Hope's nanites naturally counter the spell placed upon him. His speed returns to normal, and he looks at the drone with an expression of even hotter rage than before.

""So it's like that. You hide in Chrona, where you have the advantage of time on your side. You heard me start to utter a Word of Power, and you countered me before I could even complete the effect. No matter what I do, you can see through the essence of my attacks instantly!""

The Dronesmith nods. ""Yeah. It's a cheap trick. But effective. Does it matter? If you can't even beat my drone, then don't bother with thinking you'll have a chance against me in person. Face it, Hope. I outclass you now. Things aren't the way they were when I first made you.""

""You think you're better than me."" Hope says, his tone darkening. ""But what else is new? You've always thought you were the superior Wordsmith, even when I wiped the floor with you. I know the truth about Chrona. Your dimension has a TDR of 200, which is twice the Hall of Heroes, but that also makes it less stable. You have to stay inside more than I do otherwise you could suffer severe side effects.""

""Actually, it's a 250x differential."" Jason retorts. ""And those 'side effects' aren't as serious as you make them out to be. I solved them years ago. I just choose to fight you with a drone because it's all I need to use to win.""

""Liar."" Hope snaps back. ""It's because you're afraid. If we fought on equal terms, I'd cut off your head before you could react. You're siccing your drone on me so you won't have to risk getting hurt. _Or worse._""

""I'm multi-tasking."" Jason counters. ""While I fight you, I'm continuing to improve my Wordsmithing and invent things that will help human society. If I go to you in person, I will only end up focusing on you instead of the bigger picture.""

""Bullshit. You're a coward. A complete fucking coward!"" Hope roars. ""Get your ass out here! **Locate!**""

Hope once again tries to utilize a Word of Power, but the instant it activates, it fails, causing him to fail at sensing his foe. He wastes a minuscule amount of mana, which really amounts to nothing at all with Excalibur serving as his battery.

""Fuck!"" Hope snarls. ""Coward! COWARD!""

""You can insult me all you want."" Jason says. ""But it doesn't matter what you say or how many times you say it. I am who I am, and I know I didn't kill Neil. I wish you'd believe me, but outside of tampering with your mind, there doesn't seem to be any way I can convince you. So here I am, at least providing you with an outlet for your aggression.""

Hope's eyes narrow.

""Always looking down on me. Since the very beginning. Always treating me like the inferior 'you', or even worse, a bratty child. But I'm not a kid, Jason. I'm the only adult in the room, and I'm not going to let you play games with the lives of your fellow humans!""

Hope slides his thumb down Excalibur's crossguard, tapping into it to communicate with King Arthur through their mental link. Instantly, King Arthur receives his command, then transfers that command back to Solomon inside Chrona.

Multiple pre-planned occurrences rapidly play out, taking less than a second of realspace-time.

Solomon's Crown materializes on top of Hope's head. A series of spells activate, empowered by several Heroes hidden within the Hall of Heroes' confines, two of the key players being Moses and Aaron.

Energy surges into Hope's body. His blue eyes sparkly faintly as his connection to Excalibur deepens. Naturally, Jason immediately notices the prominent golden, gem-encrusted crown that has appeared atop Hope's head.

With Solomon accelerating Hope's thoughts and Excalibur empowering his body, Hope attacks the Dronesmith again. This time, Jason is not able to handily wave his clone off or easily dismiss him.

What follows is a fast and brutal melee.

The Dronesmith summons a silver-colored sword of its own, one that lacks any extravagant visual qualities or flair, but appears to be built solidly with reliable materials. The blade, not a replica of Excalibur, but its own creation entirely, matches Excalibur's durability and cutting power, yet lacks its extraordinary mana-generation qualities.

It makes up for this loss in far greater and more tangible properties, such as its far greater weight of almost ten tons. It strikes with deceptive swiftness, countering Excalibur's mana-infused properties.

_Bang! Clang! Clang!_

Hope swiftly attacks the drone, and Jason counters by swinging his sword against Hope's. The two of them trade several slashes, with Hope aiming for killing blows with every attack, while Jason responds with perfectly aimed slashes and follow-ups that deflect or bat aside Hope's vicious strikes.

In the span of less than a minute, the two men trade blows several dozen times, with Hope sprouting wings and flying around Jason, circling the drone like a hawk. He repeatedly attacks when he spots a moment of weakness, but Jason always sees the attack coming and deflects it at the last second.

""Hope. I'm trying to give you a chance here."" Jason warns. ""I've been watching you for years. You've been slowly going mad, acting less and less like yourself. You aren't acting like the man Amelia would want you to be!""

""Don't weaponize my wife, you piece of shit."" Hope fires back, summoning power onto Excalibur to try and cut through Jason's sword. He fails, and Jason easily knocks his slash to the side. ""One way or another, one of us is not leaving here alive!""

""This all started after Gressil captured you."" Jason says, ignoring Hope's words. ""After he kidnapped you, tortured you, and left you limbless on that table. I know you blame me for what happened, but it was clearly him who did that! Don't let Gressil manipulate your thoughts! You're better than this!""

Hope's eye twitches. He feels a pang of agony in his chest at the reminder of that horrifying ordeal. This causes his anger to intensify.

""You DARE mention that?! Fuck you, Jason! FUCK you! How can you speak of something so casually when you know NOTHING about my suffering?! I'm a better Wordsmith than you because my psyche was forged in the fires of pain and agony! You're a soft weakling who fights through proxies!""

A brief silence follows as the two men again trade five attacks, then five more, neither making any headway.

""You speak of 'forging' as if your trauma made you stronger."" Jason says emotionlessly. ""But what if that's not the truth at all? What if instead it broke you? What if it made you weaker than before? Can you argue otherwise?""

""I don't need to argue with you. You're an insect."" Hope sneers. ""I'll let my sword do the talking.""

Secretly, Hope sends a surge of spiritual energy into a necklace hidden under his clothes. On this necklace, several dozen tiny objects hang, attached by a string empowered via Wordsmithing. Rather than calling it a 'string', it would be more accurate to call it a strand of Wordsmithium fashioned in the design of a string.

And these tiny objects are not pieces of jewelry, but instead, shrunken Heroic Artifacts!

Hope's trickle of mana taps into one of those artifacts, a tiny walking staff that once belonged to the Mountain Hermit, Jeremiah. A second later, Hope's eyes faintly change. He gains the ability to seemingly peer through all of creation, allowing him to see lines drawn in the air, lines which trail and predict the movement of the Dronesmith.

As if peering into the Matrix, Hope's eyes dart from side to side, looking through the fabric of reality, even peering into the true mechanical construction of his foe. It takes no effort on his part to spot the deficiencies of this mechanical wonder, and for him to identify minor but crucial flaws he can exploit!

Hope snaps again! He charges at Jason, swinging his sword in the same wild style as he has several times before. Jason's drone quickly counters, blocking the attack as Hope swipes at his left side, but then Hope changes his attack at the last second, turning the sword from a wild slash into a carefully aimed stab!

The drone tries to deflect his attack, but due to an awkward combination of mitigating factors, its arm joints fail to rotate at the exact degree needed to fully deflect the blow.

Excalibur slides past Jason's sword and narrowly stabs into the drone's waist, then slashes outward, ripping a hole in its skin right above where a human's thigh would be.

Naturally, the drone feels no pain, but it still flickers backward as Jason takes a few minutes inside Chrona to evaluate the damage.

""Hahaha. First blood goes to me."" Hope says, grinning evilly. ""And soon, second blood, third blood, all the way to the final attack.""

""Nice feint. You actually deceived me."" Jason replies.

As he speaks, the hole ripped in the drone's thigh instantly repairs itself, undoing the damage Excalibur caused. But Hope doesn't bother worrying about it. Even if he shatters the drone's body, this battle is little more than a warm-up exercise. Jason can always send more drones. Killing the First Wordsmith is the only way for Hope to truly win.

""Things aren't going to go the way they did before."" Hope says confidently. ""You can't stall me forever, asshole. I'll find your weaknesses. I'll exploit them. I'll rip apart your little toys, and then I'll rip apart _you._""

Inside Chrona, Jason's expression dims slightly.

The expression doesn't reach the face of his drone. It remains just as stoic as ever.

""I just don't understand."" Jason says slowly. ""We're not enemies, Hope. You don't have to be so stubborn. If you just listened to reason, you'd know I didn't kill Neil. I'm not deliberately sabotaging you. And for god's sake, I _obviously_ don't control the Plague. You've been fed a stream of lies, and now you're going to execute me for them?""

""We're way beyond 'reason' and measured words."" Hope says, chuckling under his breath. ""Your feeble attempts to cloud my mind are pathetic. My ancestors smile on me. They support me in my battle. Can you say the same?""

""I don't have the Hero comrades you do."" Jason answers. ""But that doesn't mean _no_ Heroes support me. And even if they didn't, it wouldn't matter. I've seen enough here to know the truth about you.""

Hope's smile twists slightly. He frowns at Jason.

""And that truth is?""

""You've been slacking."" Jason immediately answers. ""Your Wordsmithing is sloppy. Crude. You're relying on the other Heroes to empower yourself. I'll admit, it's something I used to do, and probably still would be doing if Solomon hadn't jumped ship to you. But in truth, it's been a blessing not having my hand held by ancient fossils. I constantly use my Wordsmithing. I hone it, train it, and master it to the fullest extent that I possibly can.""

Jason lightly points his sword at Hope.

""That's the difference between you and me. I failed before, but I won't fail again. I learned from my mistakes. I mastered my powers. I have become a fully self-actualized Hero on par with my predecessors. I can stand on my own two feet with pride. But you? You've hobbled yourself by relying on the abilities of others. You have no clue just how incredible Wordsmithing truly is. How can you defeat me when you can't even control your own ego?""

Hope's eye twitches. A dark cloud washes over his face as his emotions rapidly begin to boil. He ignores Solomon yelling at him inside his mind, warning him not to lose control and fall victim to Jason's goading.

""That smugness. Oh, how I _hate_ it. If I can't beat you today, I'll kill myself tomorrow. That's how dead-set I am on killing you, Jason. I'll pay you back for every humiliation you've dealt me. And I'll start by breaking your drone's body so your soul can learn humility!""

Hope attacks once more. This time, despite his anger, he focuses all his thoughts on the battle, using Jeremiah's ability to peer through the essence of warfare.

When the Dronesmith attacks, he evades by the slimmest of margins, counters, and swipes Excalibur across its chest.

When he attacks first, he feints, ducks, and even dodges the drone's counter-attack, toying with it and easily outmaneuvering its increasingly clumsy movements.

Before, the drone seemed slick and untouchable. But now, Hope sees that it is in fact quite a limited mechanical construct. It is little more than a vessel Jason can use to unleash his Wordsmithing remotely. In truth, Jason's fine control of the Dronesmith is atrocious and incapable of threatening a sufficiently prepared enemy.

The Kolvaxians lost because of Jason's Wordsmithing. Their limited intellect prevented them from countering his drone.

But Hope is not a mindless Plagueborn. He is a Wordsmith who understands Jason's abilities, so he is able to counter his opponent's methods.

...

Minutes pass. Half an hour later, Hope grins as he continues to brutally attack the weakened drone. By now, hundreds of small cuts line the drone's body, with Jason no longer able to rapidly repair its injuries due to how frequently Hope lands shallow and serious hits. And with Hope not letting up even a little bit, he's frequently able to make major gains, learning how the drone fights and adapting to its combat style.

One big gain Hope makes during this period is when he notices an odd pattern in the Drone's movements. Every five or so minutes, the drone's combat capabilities take a massive nose-dive. It doesn't fight as well as before, and its combat style even switches up to be distinctly different. Often, it will switch to focusing on defense, usually with middling results.

During these periods, the drone almost entirely stops talking to Hope. If it does speak, it doesn't say anything of substance, and merely gives curt 'yes' or 'no' replies.

Naturally, with Solomon's assistance, Hope manages to figure out the truth of the matter.

[Five minutes in realspace is 1,250 minutes in Chrona.] Solomon explains to Hope through his Mind Realm link. [That's twenty hours. Jason is probably staying awake while you fight him, and using his spare attention to control the drone. But when he finally needs sleep, he puts someone else in control of it. Possibly Fiona, or someone else within Chrona. That's why it stops responding. They don't want to give away that Jason isn't the one controlling it.]

Hope's eyes flash. [Jason must be pushing himself to sleep for only 4-6 hours at a time. That means, every five minutes, I have only a minute of time to use my Wordsmithing while Jason can't retaliate! But if I do that and he wakes up, he'll likely realize I've figured out his dilation dilemma!]

Solomon nods grimly. [Then we'll have to strike hard and fast the next time he goes to sleep. I estimate another four minutes and fifteen seconds before that happens, based on the previous cycles.]

Hope narrows his eyes. [Tell me when that moment arrives. I'll take care of the rest!]

...

Inside Hope's Mind Realm, many different Heroes sit around in comfortable chairs or recliners, having built up Hope's Mind Realm to be a comfortable environment, yet also one that provides stimulation via ancient electronic video games, or simulations for them to battle one another and pass the time.

One Hero sits off by himself in a garden not dissimilar to the one in the Hall of Heroes. Jeremiah, the Mountain Hermit, sips some coffee from a fancy cup while looking off into the distance, not paying much attention to anything in particular.

Solomon approaches him, then takes a seat in a nearby chair.

""Ah, Jeremiah. So, what do you think of the battle so far?""

Jeremiah doesn't answer at first. He continues to drink his coffee for a few moments, then slowly blinks his eyes and looks at Solomon, appearing confused.

""Hmm?""

""The battle outside. Hope versus Jason."" Solomon repeats. ""Your power is helping the boy fight much harder than before! I'll bet that makes you proud.""

Jeremiah, once again, slowly blinks his eyes, uncomprehending.

""My... power. My gift?""

""Yes."" Solomon says, this time becoming the confused one. ""He's using your eyes to fight Jason.""

""Ah."" Jeremiah says, looking away.

After several long seconds, and another sip of coffee, Jeremiah looks at Solomon, meeting his expectant gaze.

""Who is... Jason?""

""Y-you don't know??"" Solomon asks, bewildered. Unfortunately, despite more than a century passing since his awakening inside the Hall of Heroes, Jeremiah hasn't spoken to hardly anyone, including the Knowledge-Seeker. Solomon simply doesn't know much about him.

""No."" Jeremiah answers. ""I do not.""

""Well, I have a few minutes to spare."" Solomon mutters. ""It's like this. Hope is the Second Wordsmith, and Jason...""

Over the next three or so minutes, Solomon explains the basic histories of the two Wordsmiths to Jeremiah, who in turn remains silent, staring off into the distance while he sips his coffee.

""...and that's how we get to today, where the two of them are fighting."" Solomon concludes. ""Have you not been watching realspace through Hope's eyes?""

Jeremiah closes his eyes for a moment. Then, he opens them, turning to look at Solomon once more.

""Sorry... your name... who are you?""

""S...Solomon..."" Solomon says, feeling the energy deflate from his body. ""The Knowledge-Seeker.""

""Oh. So it's like that."" Jeremiah says slowly, looking away once more. ""Are we done talking?""

""I...""

Solomon starts to mutter something, but the complete lack of interest from his fellow Hero makes him feel as if he's pouring the waters of his mental energy into a bucket filled with holes. It's all ultimately seeping out and going to waste.

""I'll just... take my leave. Pleasure chatting with you, Jeremiah.""

""Right. Same."" Jeremiah mutters perfunctorily, as Solomon trudges away.

Many minutes later, Jeremiah slowly blinks his eyes.

""What a strange fellow. Never stops talking...""",14,1732042641.0,HFY,7,0.94,False

""I just don't understand."" Jason says slowly. ""We're not enemies, Hope. You don't have to be so stubborn. If you just listened to reason, you'd know I didn't kill Neil. I'm not deliberately sabotaging you. And for god's sake, I _obviously_ don't control the Plague. You've been fed a stream of lies, and now you're going to execute me for them?""

""We're way beyond 'reason' and measured words."" Hope says, chuckling under his breath. ""Your feeble attempts to cloud my mind are pathetic. My ancestors smile on me. They support me in my battle. Can you say the same?""

""I don't have the Hero comrades you do."" Jason answers. ""But that doesn't mean _no_ Heroes support me. And even if they didn't, it wouldn't matter. I've seen enough here to know the truth about you.""

Hope's smile twists slightly. He frowns at Jason.

""And that truth is?""

""You've been slacking."" Jason immediately answers. ""Your Wordsmithing is sloppy. Crude. You're relying on the other Heroes to empower yourself. I'll admit, it's something I used to do, and probably still would be doing if Solomon hadn't jumped ship to you. But in truth, it's been a blessing not having my hand held by ancient fossils. I constantly use my Wordsmithing. I hone it, train it, and master it to the fullest extent that I possibly can.""

Jason lightly points his sword at Hope.

""That's the difference between you and me. I failed before, but I won't fail again. I learned from my mistakes. I mastered my powers. I have become a fully self-actualized Hero on par with my predecessors. I can stand on my own two feet with pride. But you? You've hobbled yourself by relying on the abilities of others. You have no clue just how incredible Wordsmithing truly is. How can you defeat me when you can't even control your own ego?""

Hope's eye twitches. A dark cloud washes over his face as his emotions rapidly begin to boil. He ignores Solomon yelling at him inside his mind, warning him not to lose control and fall victim to Jason's goading.

""That smugness. Oh, how I _hate_ it. If I can't beat you today, I'll kill myself tomorrow. That's how dead-set I am on killing you, Jason. I'll pay you back for every humiliation you've dealt me. And I'll start by breaking your drone's body so your soul can learn humility!""

Hope attacks once more. This time, despite his anger, he focuses all his thoughts on the battle, using Jeremiah's ability to peer through the essence of warfare.

When the Dronesmith attacks, he evades by the slimmest of margins, counters, and swipes Excalibur across its chest.

When he attacks first, he feints, ducks, and even dodges the drone's counter-attack, toying with it and easily outmaneuvering its increasingly clumsy movements.

Before, the drone seemed slick and untouchable. But now, Hope sees that it is in fact quite a limited mechanical construct. It is little more than a vessel Jason can use to unleash his Wordsmithing remotely. In truth, Jason's fine control of the Dronesmith is atrocious and incapable of threatening a sufficiently prepared enemy.

The Kolvaxians lost because of Jason's Wordsmithing. Their limited intellect prevented them from countering his drone.

But Hope is not a mindless Plagueborn. He is a Wordsmith who understands Jason's abilities, so he is able to counter his opponent's methods.

...

Minutes pass. Half an hour later, Hope grins as he continues to brutally attack the weakened drone. By now, hundreds of small cuts line the drone's body, with Jason no longer able to rapidly repair its injuries due to how frequently Hope lands shallow and serious hits. And with Hope not letting up even a little bit, he's frequently able to make major gains, learning how the drone fights and adapting to its combat style.

One big gain Hope makes during this period is when he notices an odd pattern in the Drone's movements. Every five or so minutes, the drone's combat capabilities take a massive nose-dive. It doesn't fight as well as before, and its combat style even switches up to be distinctly different. Often, it will switch to focusing on defense, usually with middling results.

During these periods, the drone almost entirely stops talking to Hope. If it does speak, it doesn't say anything of substance, and merely gives curt 'yes' or 'no' replies.

Naturally, with Solomon's assistance, Hope manages to figure out the truth of the matter.

[Five minutes in realspace is 1,250 minutes in Chrona.] Solomon explains to Hope through his Mind Realm link. [That's twenty hours. Jason is probably staying awake while you fight him, and using his spare attention to control the drone. But when he finally needs sleep, he puts someone else in control of it. Possibly Fiona, or someone else within Chrona. That's why it stops responding. They don't want to give away that Jason isn't the one controlling it.]

Hope's eyes flash. [Jason must be pushing himself to sleep for only 4-6 hours at a time. That means, every five minutes, I have only a minute of time to use my Wordsmithing while Jason can't retaliate! But if I do that and he wakes up, he'll likely realize I've figured out his dilation dilemma!]

Solomon nods grimly. [Then we'll have to strike hard and fast the next time he goes to sleep. I estimate another four minutes and fifteen seconds before that happens, based on the previous cycles.]

Hope narrows his eyes. [Tell me when that moment arrives. I'll take care of the rest!]

...

Inside Hope's Mind Realm, many different Heroes sit around in comfortable chairs or recliners, having built up Hope's Mind Realm to be a comfortable environment, yet also one that provides stimulation via ancient electronic video games, or simulations for them to battle one another and pass the time.

One Hero sits off by himself in a garden not dissimilar to the one in the Hall of Heroes. Jeremiah, the Mountain Hermit, sips some coffee from a fancy cup while looking off into the distance, not paying much attention to anything in particular.

Solomon approaches him, then takes a seat in a nearby chair.

""Ah, Jeremiah. So, what do you think of the battle so far?""

Jeremiah doesn't answer at first. He continues to drink his coffee for a few moments, then slowly blinks his eyes and looks at Solomon, appearing confused.

""Hmm?""

""The battle outside. Hope versus Jason."" Solomon repeats. ""Your power is helping the boy fight much harder than before! I'll bet that makes you proud.""

Jeremiah, once again, slowly blinks his eyes, uncomprehending.

""My... power. My gift?""

""Yes."" Solomon says, this time becoming the confused one. ""He's using your eyes to fight Jason.""

""Ah."" Jeremiah says, looking away.

After several long seconds, and another sip of coffee, Jeremiah looks at Solomon, meeting his expectant gaze.

""Who is... Jason?""

""Y-you don't know??"" Solomon asks, bewildered. Unfortunately, despite more than a century passing since his awakening inside the Hall of Heroes, Jeremiah hasn't spoken to hardly anyone, including the Knowledge-Seeker. Solomon simply doesn't know much about him.

""No."" Jeremiah answers. ""I do not.""

""Well, I have a few minutes to spare."" Solomon mutters. ""It's like this. Hope is the Second Wordsmith, and Jason...""

Over the next three or so minutes, Solomon explains the basic histories of the two Wordsmiths to Jeremiah, who in turn remains silent, staring off into the distance while he sips his coffee.

""...and that's how we get to today, where the two of them are fighting."" Solomon concludes. ""Have you not been watching realspace through Hope's eyes?""

Jeremiah closes his eyes for a moment. Then, he opens them, turning to look at Solomon once more.

""Sorry... your name... who are you?""

""S...Solomon..."" Solomon says, feeling the energy deflate from his body. ""The Knowledge-Seeker.""

""Oh. So it's like that."" Jeremiah says slowly, looking away once more. ""Are we done talking?""

""I...""

Solomon starts to mutter something, but the complete lack of interest from his fellow Hero makes him feel as if he's pouring the waters of his mental energy into a bucket filled with holes. It's all ultimately seeping out and going to waste.

""I'll just... take my leave. Pleasure chatting with you, Jeremiah.""

""Right. Same."" Jeremiah mutters perfunctorily, as Solomon trudges away.

Many minutes later, Jeremiah slowly blinks his eyes.

""What a strange fellow. Never stops talking...""",11,1732042639.0,TheCryopodToHell,2,1.0,False
1gv4vqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1gv4vqu/patient_log_437/,Patient Log #437,"I shouldn't have decrypted those patient files. Fifteen years as a data analyst for the CDC, and I've never seen documentation like this. It started with a statistical anomaly: missing persons cases spiking in counties where sleep medication prescriptions dropped to zero.

The first log was patient #437. Female, 34, prescribed Ambien for chronic insomnia. After three months of use, she reported intense lucidity during sleep paralysis. Standard side effect. But her neurological readings were unprecedented. Her brain activity during paralysis matched patterns typically only seen in deep coma patients who later reported full consciousness during medical procedures. She described lying there, unable to move, watching someone methodically reorganize her furniture every night.

Small changes. A chair three inches to the left. A book reversed on the shelf. A photo frame slightly tilted. But she swore nobody lived with her.

The footage from her sleep study showed nothing moving. But the objects changed positions between frames. No blur, no movement captured. Just different positions in sequential screenshots. The timestamps were continuous, no gaps.

Her final recorded session was different. Audio picked up breathing from an unidentified source. The patient's vitals showed elevated heart rate but complete muscle paralysis. The camera feed cut for 2.3 seconds.

When video resumed, all furniture was precisely mirrored. Not moved - mirrored. Left became right. Every imperfection, every scratch, reversed perfectly. Including the patient's body. Her birthmark shifted from left shoulder to right. Internal scans later showed all her organs were reversed too.

She never reported feeling different. But staff noted she now wrote with her left hand instead of her right. Began parting her hair on the opposite side. Small, instinctive things she didn't notice herself doing.

Three days later, she stopped taking Ambien. Said she couldn't risk another episode. The next morning, her apartment was empty. Not just of her - of everything. Down to the paint on the walls. Mirror smooth concrete remained.

I've found 437 identical cases. All ending the same way. All preceded by patients describing the same thing - watching someone or something methodically practicing, learning to recreate our world in reverse.

The CDC database flags new cases daily. Doctors are baffled by patients presenting with mirrored anatomies. Missing persons reports flood in.

I haven't slept since finding these files. But sometimes, in my peripheral vision, I catch my reflection moving independently. And last night, I swear my coffee mug was on the other side of my desk.

It’s been a week since he gave him my number and I haven’t heard anything. Should I wait to see if he texts me? Or, should I just go for and text him and see if he wants to go to coffee or something?

Morning light blasted through my blinds, jolting me awake.

I had only been asleep a couple hours.

My fingers trembled as I plugged the USB flash drive into my laptop, dreading what I’d see. My laptop screen flickered, and I clicked on the file, reliving last night’s nightmare in grainy footage.

It was worse than I remembered. 

The headlights in the footage were like eyes, unblinking, menacing.

I could feel being there in the driver seat again, my body shivering involuntarily. But even with the rear dash cam, I couldn’t make out his face. 

He stayed in the shadows, his features blurred.

He's careful...

But the truck clicked in my mind, even if the footage was grainy. A blue Ford F-150, just like my uncle used to have. An older model. No license plate on the front, sure… but an old truck like that isn't terribly unique in the area. If we could find that truck, we might find him.

Later, I sat in the main visitor's seating area of the Meridian Police Department.

An hour or so passed before I found myself in Officer Daniels’ office. It seemed like Officer Daniels wanted to be anywhere else in the world than in his office with me.

He tossed the USB drive back to me as he sat back behind his desk.

He barely glanced at his monitor, at the footage I had from last night before smirking. “Look,” he said, leaning back, “you’re a bit of a pot stirrer. Harassing locals like this.”

“Harassing locals?” I snapped back. “That guy on that monitor fucking followed me off the road last night. He fucking sprinted at my car! At me!”

Daniels raised an eyebrow. “A blurry video of headlights blinding me... You spend too much time on TikTok. Everything ain't a conspiracy.""

""I know Maggie didn't just vanish.""

Officer Daniels rolled his eyes.

""Maybe Eddie Baker thought you were in trouble,” he said.

“Eddie Baker?”

My heart skipped what seemed like several beats.

“Yeah, Eddie Baker,” Daniels sighed. “His granddaddy was Edward Baker, old gold refiner. Eddie’s rough around the edges, sure, but that don’t make him a criminal.” 

He gave me a thin, artificial smile. 

“Drop this before you find yourself in a big pot of cream you can’t churn out of.”

His hand was on my shoulder as he ushered me gently towards the front door.

As I walked through the parking lot, I called my friend Ryan, bombarding him with a recap of the police's reaction once again. About Eddie Baker. About the corrupt world we're living in.

I word vomited for two whole minutes before I realized Ryan wasn't really responding.

I finally stopped talking.

“Do you have any idea how reckless you’re being?” Ryan finally asked me. “You’re out there alone, chasing a potential killer, someone who probably knows you’re looking for him.”

“I’m not doing this for fun. This fucker might have taken Maggie.”

“And probably you next!” He snapped. “I’m coming over with pepper spray and a gun.”

“I don’t need a gun,” I insisted, though my voice wavered. “I just need proof.”

He groaned but didn’t argue further. 

“You’re in over your head.”

That night, I ate a big bowl of pho while I just Googled for hours. Looking for anything about the Baker family, but I just kept hitting dead ends. All old, unhelpful articles.

Almost nothing about Eddie. Was that even his name?

And worse…

I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. Every creak or odd noise in the house made me jump. 

And then it happened, a loud crash that actually shattered the silence of the night. 

My heart stopped.

I dropped my phone and ran to the living room, where shattered glass lay scattered across the floor.

In the center of the room was a severed lamb’s head, a pool of blood soaking into my carpet. Its lifeless eyes stared right at me, mouth twisted in a gruesome snarl.

A note pinned to its forehead, smeared in red letters.

***I KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU*** 

***THAN YOU KNOW ABOUT ME***

***CUNT***

I stood there, numb with shock. 

I stumbled backwards, nearly tripping over the glass as I grabbed my phone. My hands shook like crazy as I called Ryan, panic seeping into my voice.

“Ryan, I… bring over the gun,” I stammered, eyes fixed on the grotesque scene. “He knows. He knows I’m looking for him.”

I FaceTimed Ryan, showing him the scene.

“Stay where you are,” Ryan replied, his voice tense but steady. “I’ll be there in ten minutes. Don’t touch anything, and don’t go near the windows.”

Ryan arrived at the same time as the police. He had called them again. They took pictures of the scene and then helped me clean up the room. I didn't say much to them, other than giving them a small statement and reciting the facts of the night.

They've dropped the ball with Maggie's case so many times over the years, I've lost all faith in the police's ability to actually help the city's residents. And I honestly don't know who I can even trust.

After the police left, the events of the night looped in my mind like a horror film. I promised Ryan I'd go to the chief of police again in the morning. And call my parents to let them know what's going on.

But something about all of this felt so wrong.

The severed lamb’s head, the blood, the note. It all felt unreal, but the shattered window and the lingering stench of blood kept reminding me it was.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night. Not really. 

I sat in my living room with Ryan by my side, his gun lying between us on the coffee table. The curtains were pulled tight, leaving the room in a gloom that matched my mood. 

Ryan was still asleep on the couch, his arm draped protectively over his face, but I couldn’t stay still any longer. My anger and fear wouldn’t let me.

Eddie knew about me, and he wanted me scared. He wanted me to stop, but I wouldn’t.

I needed answers. 

Not just for Maggie but for myself. If I was in danger anyway, there was no reason to stop now. Maybe I could find something to put me back in the drivers seat of this shit of an investigation I've been running.

Quietly, I picked up my laptop and continued digging online. Most of what I found continued to be useless. Random mentions of Eddie’s grandfather, Edward, old mining operations in California and Nevada.

But one article stood out: a small mention of a hunting cabin deep in the mountains here in Idaho, land that had belonged to the Baker family for decades.

Ryan stirred awake, yawning. He blinked, then sat up when he saw me on the laptop. “You’re not still…” His voice trailed off when he saw my face.

“I’m going out there,” I said, pointing at the screen, my eyes locked on the article I had found. “The hunting cabin. If he is hiding something, it’s there.”

“You’re insane.” Ryan rubbed his face, his eyes still bleary. “Do you even hear yourself? You believe he’s the crazy dude who threw a severed lamb’s head through your window, and now you want to walk right into his territory?”

I nodded with a slight shrug.

""You're an idiot,"" he said.

“I'd rather be an idiot than a coward. Our city is fucked with corruption. I'm doing this. Besides, it's not like I'm asking you to come."" 

Ryan sighed heavily, shaking his head. 

“You know I’m not letting you go alone.” He grabbed the gun off the table and checked the chamber, making sure it was loaded. “But if we do this, we need a real plan. No rushing in blindly.”

""Okay,"" I agreed.

""How about this is recon? We go see what we find, but that's it. Just take notes,"" Ryan said aloud, forming a plan he was comfortable with.

""Deal. It's 80 miles north.""

Part of me was terrified what we might find out there, but another part… the part that refused to let Maggie’s memory be tarnished by inaction… was ready.

We spent the next few hours gathering what we needed. Flashlights, extra phone chargers, snacks, and a map of the area. Ryan had insisted we stop by his dad’s place on the way out. 

His dad was a retired private investigator, the type who had more surveillance gadgets than the NSA. Ryan came back with a box of cameras and trackers.

“If the coast is really clear, we can mount some of these on his property,” he explained as he packed them into the trunk.

We drove for a couple hours, the city giving way to open country, and then dense, winding forest roads. The deeper we went, the more civilization seemed to vanish. The sky above turned from clear blue to overcast gray, and soon, mist began to gather between the trees, thick and damp.

Finally, we turned down a narrow, overgrown path, barely wide enough for Ryan’s truck.

The cabin loomed ahead, a dark silhouette against the backdrop of endless trees. It looked abandoned, the kind of place that held a hundred secrets, none of them good. The windows were dark, the roof sagging in places, and an eerie silence hung over the clearing.

We parked a good distance away, hidden behind a thick line of trees. 

Ryan killed the engine, and for a moment, we just sat there, staring at the cabin. My pulse pounded in my ears, and my mouth felt dry.

“Last chance to back out,” Ryan said, his voice barely a whisper.

I shook my head. I was ready. 

We moved cautiously, staying low, making our way toward the cabin. The air was thick with tension, every snapped twig underfoot making me flinch. We reached the side of the building, and Ryan motioned for me to stay back as he peered through one of the grimy windows.

The cabin seemed empty, dilapidated from the outside. The walls were all warped wood, peeling with time and weather, as if the structure had resigned to the elements long ago.

The land definitely was. Overgrown weeds choked the driveway, and moss blanketed the sagging porch steps. A cracked stone path led from the road to the front door, but even that seemed like an afterthought, a whisper of an invitation buried under decades of neglect.

It was eerie.

“Alright, quick, quick,” Ryan said, pulling out some of the surveillance cameras. 

I ran over to him and knelt down, mirroring what he was doing, unwrapping the cables that were taut around the cameras. Ryan was looking at the cabin and the area around for good spots.

“Three should work,” he said.

“Where?” I asked.

“Two in front. One in the back.”

Ryan got up with one of the cameras in his hands and started to walk off.

“Where are you going?” I asked.

I knew he was going around back to hide the camera somewhere inconspicuous. But the truth is I was afraid to be alone... there in that moment.

He pointed towards the creek behind the cabin.

""Alright, where should I put mine?"" I asked him.

""Try to get a view of the front.""

And with that, Ryan hurried toward the back of the cabin. I scanned the front yard, searching for a good spot among the trees. But then my attention shifted to the porch.

One of the beams had a small gap, a crack just wide enough to hide something. I sized up the camera in my hand. It seemed like a perfect fit.

As I approached the porch, my eyes snagged on the front window.

For all the cabin's dilapidated exterior.... a sagging roof, peeling paint, and warped boards...  The inside was a jarring contradiction. I froze mid-step, heart stuttering in my chest.

The interior was pristine.

Not just clean, but *opulent*. The kind of sleek modernity you’d expect in a millionaire’s mansion, not buried within this crumbling facade.

Polished hardwood floors stretched out like the surface of a calm lake, catching the glow of recessed lights. Matching leather furniture was artfully arranged around a massive TV mounted to the wall. Real paintings... bold, vibrant, expensive... hung in perfect alignment.

For a moment, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. How could something so beautiful exist behind such a decrepit mask?

I was enthralled.

Then it happened.

Ryan came sprinting around the corner.

""Don't you hear that?!"" he yelled. ""We have to go! Now!""

I had been in a trance. 

I snapped out of it and listened.

A car was coming down the road, the churning of gravel and branches breaking under the car growing louder as it came right towards us.",7,1732042378.0,nosleep,2,0.82,False

I am a male 26, who has been recently going through the most unbearable stomach bug I've ever had. Since last Monday I've been going to the bathroom twice as frequently and it has been a nightmare. The first day I had to pass stool I was in the shower when I realized I had to s*** again and ran out the shower and has to do another poop. Went back to the shower. Cleaned up. Got out. Had to poop again. Now all these foods were cloudy but they were in the middle of soft and hard. The next day I take some Imodium and I only poop specks. That is until in the late night where I have a larger stool pass. The third day was bad but I started to get used to it. I missed a few days at my job and it began to scare me. I live at home with my parents and I notify them what was happening and they told me that it was just my poor diet. I have been overweight and have recently been trying to lose weight and eat healthy. I've gotten good results but for over this past 10 days I barely eaten anything. Over the past 2 days I legitimately haven't eaten anything. I've only eat drinking water and knock off Pedialyte. I went to the urgent care on Saturday and since I was in this weird limbo of not having insurance (I aged out of my insurance a couple months ago but my new insurance which is 1199 doesn't kick in until the 29th of this month) my mother paid for the visit. I got a blood test. They weighed me and I found out that I lost over 30 pounds (307 to 272) since I last last got way, which was a few months back. I was told by the doc that he heard gas in my stomach and said that it was too early to tell what was going on with me. He asked me if I been having any bad diarrhea. I told him no. The next day. I have the worst case of diarrhea and I start pooping just liquid. At first it was dark like coffee and then it started to become a little bit more light. To be fair, I took a Pepto bismol earlier that day but I still been having these liquid poops. Yesterday was the day I started to feel better but this morning I've had to wake up early in the morning and poop then 3 hours later poop again. It's been like this for a week now. I've had an history of constipation and currently have a small anal fissure can spasm if I move too quickly after a bowel movement. I legitimately don't know what to do at this point. I want to go to the ER closest to me ( which is also the hospital that me and my parents work in) and get seen by doctors but my parents keep telling me I'm over reacting. I also know they're afraid that since I technically don't have any coverage that either I or they are going to have to pay a massive medical bill. I'm trying to fast track myself into the union since I know the insurance will cover everything but that's gonna take a few days and I don't know if I can wait that long.",1,1732042370.0,AskDocs,1,0.67,False
1gv4rih,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1gv4rih/coffee_insights/,Coffee insights,"Does anyone practice meditation on their coffee? I’ve been trying this with hot coffee lately and I’ve found there’s a few basic ways you can try it. First you can mindfully drink the coffee while making the experience of drinking the anchor of your attention, fully tasting and feeling the warmth of the coffee. You can also smell it as weird as that sounds, I feel like this could help a lot with “finding” your breath if you struggle with feeling it in your nostrils normally. Another way you can try is by stirring the coffee and watching the tiny particles and lines swirl like a whirl pool, at first it can move pretty fast but as it slows you can see so much if you really watch, and  just remember to return your attention to whatever you choose as your anchor when your thoughts drift to something else.

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

[SynaBoost](https://sites.google.com/view/synaboost-synaboost/home) uses plant-based ingredients to promote brain health from the inside out.The most significant ingredient in SynaBoost is caffeine. Specifically, the formula contains caffeine from green coffee beans. Green coffee beans are unroasted coffee beans that have a unique ingredient makeup compared to ordinary coffee beans. These green coffee beans have higher levels of chlorogenic acid, for example, which appears to help with weight loss, inflammation, and overall energy.

Other ingredients in SynaBoost include plant extracts, such as adaptogens, to help with stress and herbs to help with blood flow.Your brain consumes more energy than any other organ in the human body and needs ample oxygen and nutrients. If blood can’t flow to your brain, it won’t perform at its best. Lack of blood flow could also contribute to plaque buildup in the brain—like the beta-amyloid plaque that increases the risk of Alzheimer’sAlzheimer’sia. It’s one reason experts recommend an active lifestyle to reduce the risk of degenerative brain disease.

# The Ingredient-Profile of SynaBoost and How It Helps

**Caffeine**

Caffeine is perhaps the most familiar stimulant known for its immediate effect on alertness. In SynaBoost, caffeine plays a pivotal role not just in waking up the brain but in enhancing focus and reducing the perception of effort during tasks. It operates by blocking adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep, thus keeping your mind alert.

**L-Tyrosine**

Next is L-Tyrosine, an amino acid that is crucial in the production of dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters that help manage stress and mental clarity. During periods of sustained mental exertion, L-Tyrosine appears to support cognitive flexibility, allowing the brain to shift gears more easily between thoughts and ideas. 

**Theacrine**

Similar to caffeine, Theacrine provides a longer-lasting boost of energy without the typical crash. Its inclusion in SynaBoost is especially beneficial for maintaining energy levels throughout the day, supporting sustained attention and motivation.

**Theobromine**

Theobromine, another familiar compound found in chocolate, works synergistically with caffeine and Theacrine in SynaBoost. It provides a smoother, less intense stimulant effect, promoting a relaxed yet alert state ideal for long periods of work or study. 

**Bacopa Monnieri**

An herb traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine, Bacopa Monnieri is well-regarded for its ability to improve memory and reduce anxiety. Its inclusion in SynaBoost is based on numerous studies that show its efficacy in boosting both the retention of new information and the speed of visual information processing.

**Rhodiola Rosea**

Rhodiola Rosea is an adaptogen known for its ability to reduce fatigue and prevent burnout from stress. By helping the body adapt to stress more effectively, it supports sustained cognitive energies, particularly during demanding tasks or when under pressure.

**Huperzia Serrata**

This traditional Chinese herb contains Huperzine A, a compound that acts as a cholinesterase inhibitor, which effectively increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. For users of SynaBoost, this means improved memory, better problem-solving abilities, and heightened alertness.

# Exploring the Benefits of SynaBoost for Enhanced Cognitive Well-being

In my journey to understand the impact of nootropics on overall brain health, SynaBoost has stood out not just for its ingredients but for the multitude of benefits it offers. Here, I'll share a deeper look into how SynaBoost has been instrumental in enhancing cognitive health and improving the quality of life for its users, including my own experiences.

Enhanced Cognitive Health and Brain Functions

One of the most significant benefits I've observed with SynaBoost is its ability to enhance overall cognitive health. It's not just about a momentary increase in alertness; it's about long-term improvements in brain function.

**Improved Focus and Clarity**

Another area where SynaBoost shines is in improving focus and mental clarity. In the world of constant distractions, maintaining focus can be a challenge. SynaBoost's formulation helps cut through the fog, offering a clearer mind and more sustained focus.

**Reduction of Nerve Pain and Tingling**

Interestingly, SynaBoost has also played a part in reducing nerve pain and tingling sensations, which can be a byproduct of nerve stress or poor cognitive health. The inclusion of anti-inflammatory agents and nerve health-supporting nutrients in SynaBoost helps alleviate these discomforts.

**Reduced Oxidative Stress and Improved Mood**

The antioxidant components of SynaBoost also contribute to reduced oxidative stress, a key factor in aging and cognitive decline. By combating free radicals, SynaBoost helps maintain the integrity of neural cells. Moreover, the mood-enhancing effects associated with stabilized neurotransmitter levels have been noticeable. 

**Enhancement of Overall Life Quality**

Ultimately, all these benefits contribute to an enhanced quality of life. With improved cognitive health, better focus, less discomfort, and a more positive mood, daily life becomes more enjoyable and fulfilling. For me, using SynaBoost has not just been about enhancing brain function but about supporting a lifestyle where mental health is prioritized.

1gv4p9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1gv4p9w/nc_ada_accomodation_denied/,(NC) ADA accomodation denied,"I'm in NC, I work for a privately held company that has over 1000 employees. I work in the call center.

I have a sleep disorder that is characterized by excessive daytime drowsiness. And before I get that, I drink more coffee; caffeine has almost no effect on me; I am on daily stimulant medications. When I say daytime drowsiness, think about the most tired you've ever been. I can't keep my eyes open; it's not a 'choice'. It's a drowsiness that I can not fight. Two months ago, I worked my 1 pm to 9:30 pm schedule without issue because I had assistance getting my kids to school in the morning, so I didn't need to wake up until 11 am. I no longer have that assistance, which makes my day start at 6 am. To be able to drive, I have to take my medication, but then I'm awake and unable to nap once I'm home. I also advised that I can usually push through 1 or 2 days, but then I will spend the rest of the week unable to work.

About a month ago, I requested a schedule change under the ADA. I filled out the form and had my sleep medicine Dr fill out their portion. I asked to shift my schedule earlier and was advised I could work as early as 9 am and as late as 7:30 pm. They have advised that my accommodation cannot be approved as there is no need for an earlier schedule. The only other options they provided were for me to try to find an agent with an earlier shift willing to switch or to have a day during the week off and work on Saturdays. I've been informed that if I refuse to continue to work my current schedule, as I declined their offer of a day during the week off, they will accept that as my resignation. I have continued to call out and have reiterated that on the current schedule, I cannot reasonably perform my job functions as all of my energy goes into just trying to function, and I don't have the energy and bandwidth to work my caseload productively. 
I've asked again about my counter offer but they have not addressed that inquiry at all. Is it legal to be forced to resign when they aren't trying to work with me to find 'reasonable' accommodation?

Additionally, I would like to add that I work remotely; I've been with my company for over 6 years but have only been in this department for 18 months. They have slowly forced remote agents to resign or find any reason to terminate. Also, I don't believe their ""undue hardship"" claim is valid. As an agent, I can't request historical hourly staffing reports or hourly service level reports to support this. Still, I can say that over the last several months, when I have come in at 1 pm, all offline activities that would take agents off of inbound calls would already be canceled, with posts from management going as far back as 10:45 am stating that offline activities were canceled due to failing service level.

Do I have any legal standing? How do I prevent them from saying that I 'resigned'?

But that was not to be. Dad had other plans. He decided it was time for me to learn the construction business, which meant working every Saturday, some Sundays and all summer long.

Then my dad bought a property near the beach where we built a house. I thought for sure we would use it for vacations. But no, it was a rental. We spent a couple of weeks there every summer only to do all the needed maintenance. Sometimes I was lucky and got in a swim in the late afternoon.

Once I graduated from high school, my dad’s plan was to make me a 60/40 partner in the business. When my twelfth-grade art teacher encouraged me to attend art school, my dad crushed that idea immediately, lecturing that all artists were bums.

My dad’s not entirely to be blamed. I was eighteen and had all the skills necessary to make a fair living. I could have stood up and followed my path. I just didn’t have the guts. So, I ended up in an unprofitable partnership with someone who knew how to work and dish out insults. It was an awful situation.

One day I confronted him. “On the last eight jobs, you say we haven’t made one penny of profit. Why the hell are we in business if not for profit?”

“Well, I have made no profit either,” my father shouted.

“You expect that to make me feel better? Shouldn’t we make a profit on every job? You said we are 60/40 partners but 40% of nothing is nothing.”

“I won’t argue with you. Profit or no profit, you got a paycheck, didn’t you? I’m going home.” He turned back to his truck, but then hesitated for a moment.

“You want everything to be peaches and cream, but business isn’t like that.”

“Business isn’t like what? A business owner sells a job, does the work and figures in profit. What the hell is peaches and cream about that?”

He walked away. I watched his back but decided not to say anything else. It would be a waste of time, anyway. I walked to my truck and started the drive home.

$120.00 a week. $120 for six full days was not enough. I had not had one raise since I started working for him full time four years ago right out of high school. He had said we would be partners. Morgan and Son partnership! What a joke! I had all the headaches of running a full-time business on a carpenter’s salary. And it wasn’t even a talented carpenter’s salary; I could start with Nichols Construction anytime, with a salary of $150.00 working only five days a week. Saturdays and Sundays would be mine for a change.

I wanted to leave. Ten long years, since age twelve, when I started working Saturdays and most Sundays when we were busy, I had worked with him, every Saturday and many Sundays, while in school. Did I say “with” him? No, you don’t work with John Morgan, you work for him. No sports, no beach, no free fun times while I was in school.

I needed more money. Sandra had just given birth to our son, and we were still in a bedroom apartment. I wanted to build a home but couldn’t afford it.

My dad still treated me like a child. The partnership thing was bullshit. I had to leave even if there were repercussions, an inevitability.

Sandra was sitting on the terrace with Jeremy in her arms when I drove up.

“Hi Hon, how are you?” I said.

“O.K., how was your day?”

“Don’t ask. How’s the champ?”

Sandra smiled. “The champ is fine. Why shouldn’t I ask about your day?”

“Let me get a beer first. I need one.”

I walked to the kitchen and came back and sat in the chaise lounge without a word.

“Well?” Sandra persisted.

“Huh—what?”

“David, what’s going on?” She asked.

“I had another argument with my dad.”

“Oh no. What was it this time?”

“Same old thing, completed another job with no profits.”

“Not on this one, too? He had said you would clear more than $500.00.”

“Slight miscalculation, I guess.”

“I guess the argument ended the same as usual,” she said.

“Yeah, he walked away as usual, not caring about what I said.”

“I know it’s hard, but I wish you wouldn’t argue with your dad so often.”

“Hey, do you think I want to? Today I came up with a great idea to save time and muscle while cutting rafters and guess what he said.”

She shook her head.

“He said it proved that any idiot could come up with a good idea. I can’t go on working for him. Besides not making money I’m owed, I have to take the insults. I’m going to leave him.”

“You’ll break his heart.”

“What about my heart?” I have to work some place where I’m respected and can also make a good living. Eventually, I’ll get my license and set up my construction business.”

“I hate for you and your dad to have a falling out over money.”

“Sandra, it’s gone way beyond money now. I can no longer stay where I’m not respected.”

“Remember David, you told me yourself that he taught you everything you know about construction.”

“So, does that mean I have to take his insults? Now he’s learning from me. Of course, he’ll never admit that.”

“I’m so sorry, Honey,” Sandra just lowered her head, and the discussion ended, but I realized in that moment that what I had endured all these years was abuse.

The rest of the week dragged by until finally Saturday afternoon arrived. My dad returned from his home with the paychecks and distributed them to the other men. He called me over to his truck.

“Here’s your check, Son.” He paused and then in a serious tone continued.

“I want to talk to you. I think you should take more responsibility on the job.”

“More responsibility? Are you kidding? I do everything but handle the money and calculate the jobs which you won’t allow me to do. I know I could do better than you. We would make a profit if I handled the business.”

My father backed up and raised his hands. He spoke in a calm voice, condescending but calm.

“There’s no need for anger. I’m just trying to make you a better contractor.”

“A better contractor? I’m no damn contractor. Contractors make money. They don’t work for a salary, a low salary like mine.”

Suddenly he changed into the real dad and shouted, “all you think about is money.”

“Damn right! I don’t work for the exercise. I can get it at the gym. I work for money to do things I want to do, like building a home for my family and saving for my son’s education.”

“Your son is still a baby, and your apartment is fine for now.”

“My son’s education and the size of my home are none of your business. I will make those decisions with no advice from you. From now on, you stay the hell out of my life.”

I rushed to my truck, cranked it up, and skidded away. As always, he wanted to control me and my life. My desires were of no interest to him. Another lousy week had ended with no solutions or profit.

That night, I was still angry when we went to bed. Sandra tried to console me, but I wasn’t receptive. My sleep was fitful and by 5:30 Sunday morning, I was having my coffee. Today would be the day. I had made my decision. I would tell him this morning.

Sandra awoke at 8:15 and came looking for me.

“How long have you been up?”

“Since 5:30 but awake most of the night. I can’t sleep until I tell my dad that I’m quitting the business.”

“Today?”

“Right now. He’ll be at the shop by now. Sundays are just another day for him. I’m not delaying what must be done.

“David, are you sure? Are you ready to go on your own? We need that money.”

I had expected more support than this.

“Believe it or not, Sandra, I’m already a better contractor than he’s ever been. Besides, Nichols Construction has already offered me $150.00 for five days a week until I get my license. I’ll make more money and have Saturdays and Sundays to spend with you and Jeremy.”

“David, what about your dad's feelings?”

“What about mine? All he needed to do was pay me a fair salary and give me the profit he’s promised. If he really gave a damn about me and our partnership, he would have done that. I’m taking care of me and my family.”

Sandra showed her misgivings, but she didn’t try to change my mind. I could see she was worried, but I was too busy thinking about facing my father to comfort her.

I left and drove to my father’s shop, slowly and in silence. I knew this was going to be unpleasant, but I also knew my well-being was at stake. I parked in front of the shop and sat silently for several minutes, planning my words. No need for any more delays. The time was now.

Despite being scared, the built-up anger far surpassed my fear.

I walked into the shop. My father was standing in front of a workbench.

“What are you doing here today? We don’t have any jobs going.”

“It has nothing to do with a job. I have to talk to you, and it can’t wait.”

“What could be so important that it couldn’t wait till Monday?” He said, studying me like I was a bug in a jar.

Finally, I faced him directly.

“Well, what’s so damn important?” he said, almost as a shout.

I hesitated a moment and cleared my throat. “I’m quitting today.”

“What?”

“I’ve taken all the disrespect that I can. I can’t take any more insults. I can’t take any more low pay. It’s time for me to quit and go into business for myself.”

“You don’t have a license,” he shouted.

“I’ll take the test and get my license. I don’t want or need your help.”

“How are you planning to support your family in the meantime?” His tone was sarcastic and nasty.

That’s when I lost it. “That’s none of your damn business. But just so you know, I’m going to work for Nichols Construction until I get my license. He’ll pay me more for fewer hours. I have off Saturdays. And he shows me respect.”

“Nichols is an idiot.” He yelled.

“Well, he has a successful business that makes a profit on every job.”

His face swelled with anger. “So, you’re still on that profit kick. Is that what brought this on? And you think you can be in business for yourself, making a profit? You’ll see, being in business is no picnic.”

“A picnic? How can you be in business for four years and not make a profit? Maybe you're just not sharing your profits with me.”

“What are you insinuating?” He shouted. “Do you think I’m stealing money from you?”

My father’s face was red. I had seen him angry on more occasions than I care to remember, but I’d never seen him this angry. I lowered my voice to just above a whisper.

“I don’t know what the hell you are doing. I know that I’m a partner who never makes a profit. The reason isn’t important. I just wanted my share. Since there aren’t any, I’m going elsewhere.”

“Go ahead, be on your own. You’ll fall flat on your face and come crawling back. Go on, get out of here.” He waved his fists.

I paused and then smiled. “You know better than that. I won’t fail and if I do, I will live in a dumpster before coming back to work for you.”

I walked out of the door and to the truck with the Morgan and Son sign on the door. I got in, clenched the steering wheel, and breathed easier than I had in years.

When I got home Sandra asked, “Did you tell him?”

“Yeah, I finally told him, and he told me to get out.”

Oh, no David.”

I knew I would get pressure from family members.

“He’s your father. Respect your father,” crap like that.

My reply would be, “Well, I’m his son. A son needs respect as well.”

On Monday I began working for the Nichols Construction company. As agreed, they paid me more and sent me on most jobs alone because I had the experience and all the tools. Within a month, I had my Class C Contractor's license and could take on building homes and small commercial buildings.

I immediately opened a checking account in the name of David Morgan Construction and kept the business money separate by paying myself a salary that went into our personal bank account. A lesson learned.

Within the year my dad and I began speaking to one another, cordially and with respect. We never once discussed business. He never asked me how my business was going and I left it at that.",1,1732041968.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

First of all. I'm sorry for any mistake since English is not my maternal language.

I'll try to explain it crearly, but I don't think I can make it shorter.

Me (F, 29) and my partner, let's call him Tom (M, 33)

So let's go back to March 2022. I moved to my parter's city from a very bad situation in my hometown. We were dating for a year at that moment and were friends for a few more years or so. His mother (let's call her Kate) has always been a kind woman and I absolutely love her, which makes the situation even harder.

Some months after I moved to their city, Kate was looking for a department to buy. She wanted to get a mortgage and, as you may know, you need to pay an amount in advance. Here is where the problems started. She took $12,600 from Tom's bank account without any permission. She didn't ask for it, she just took it. She inmediately put $6,300 back because she just needed $6,300 but took $12,000 because she was not allowed to take that amout from her bank account (I don't know the reason, that's just what she said). Tom is just a normal worker, he's not rich or anything, so she literally took half of his savings after years of work. When Tom asked her for his money, Kate told him not to worry since she was going to give him the money back in less than a year. A year passed and Tom still had no money back. After more than a year, Kate got some money from a friend who owed it to her. Tom asked Kate for some of his money and she finally gave him $,1000 back. That's all he got back until today. Every time he asks her about it, she says: ""Don't worry, you'll have it when you need it."" and that she can't give it to him because she has to pay things.

The problem is she has no intention of give Tom a single dollar, nothing. We're not telling she should give all the money back, but at least something. Her salary is more than $4,000 which is way higher than the average in my country (note in my country the average salary is around $1,200) and she won't stop travelling. I'm not talking about one or two trips a year, I'm talking about a trip every few months. Also, buying things with no intention of saving, having dinner out with friends many times per week, weekend trips, etc. She keeps spending money and has no savings after more than a decade earning more than $4,000 every month and won't give Tom his money.

When she goes on a trip, we have to take care of her two cats. On every trip. She doesn't ask for it, she doesn't even check if the date is ok to us, she just tells us ""I'm leaving from this day to this other, you'll have to come and take care of the cats"" And of course we do it because we feel bad for them and it's not their fault. Everything is booked and she just leaves, if we don't take care of them, nobody will. Kate does all that knowing Tom is depressed and taking antidepressants for years now and when he tells her something about his mental health Kate understands it as ""He should go out more"" or ""He needs to open his mind"". I feel like she doesn't take Tom, his own son, seriously, since he tried to talk about the money many times and nothing changed. She just keeps telling ""He'll have it when he'll need it"" which is a nonsense to me. Tom's literally telling that he needs it.

And since around June of the current year 2024, the situation got worse. The three of us used to meet several times per week to have lunch, snacks, visit places or do any average family plan you can think about. We were having a snack at a coffee shop one day and she told us she had something to tell. It turns out she met someone special a few months ago and since ""things sped up"" we were going to see him (let's call him Henry) in Kate's house soon. At first I was really happy for her, since she was single for years and I felt really happy to know she found a live partner.

Then the day we met Henry arrived. Kate, Tom and I were waiting for Henry in a bar. He arrived and Tom mentioned how lucky he was to find a parking space just in front of the bar. Henry told ""Yes, since I met your mother I'm so lucky I can't believe it"" (in a very serious tone and face, it was not a joke) that comment didn't give me good vibes since it felt forced to me but I discarded it, I didn't want to judge someone in just five seconds.

We took a seat at the bar and ordered our drinks and literally 5 minutes after meeting him for the first time he wants to make a toast and said: ""I hope this day never ends"" I felt confused since he was a stranger to me. Then gave an obviously prepared speech about him and his situation. It was about him being a good person because he does volunteering, doesn't do drugs or drink etc and also being a victim because (I forgot to mention) he was still married at that moment. Basically he was the average family man, cheated on his wife for months after 40 years of marriage and two sons but someway Henry was the victim because her wife and sons got angry. He left them suddenly without any explanation and lots of lies, but he's the victim because of how it affected them. At this point of the conversation I felt even more confused but I just kept listening. Then he invited Tom to be part of the family project and I was mortified like, dude, you're the new one and Tom is Kate's son, what do you even mean? But again kept listening in silence. Then he grabbed a USB memory from his pocket and told Tom it was full of his writings, that he likes to write and he should take a look to know him better. What a coincidence that he had it on his pocket since, as he said ""This is not a prepared speech"" (nobody told him it was).

Anyway Henry finishes his speech and asks Tom ""What do you think about me?"" and Tom said something like he was ok, but I can't remember tbh. Then Henry looks at me and asks: ""And you?"" and I said ""I'm still checking"" and he said ""Oh that's the best answer of all"" Basically I saw him as someone who wants to please everyone.

We were leaving the bar later. Kate was walking first, then Tom, then me and then Henry. Henry took my shoulders and started caressing them up and down while walking and honestly I felt sick. Why was this strange man touching me like that?

The second time we met him it was just two days or so after the first one. Kate was picking us up in her car and Henry was coming with her. Henry got out of the car and went straight to Tom and asked ""Can I give you a hug?"" Henry was a total stranger so it felt weird. I usually sit in the copilot seat because I get dizzy in the back seats, but if someone is already sitting there, I'm not gonna ask them for the seat. So Tom and I sat in the back and Kate asked me ""Are you sure you're ok sitting in the back?"" So, for our conversation, Henry realized about my situation and he asked me to change places. I told him it was no necessary but he kept insisting and even got out of the car and opened my door. He kept insisting and I kept telling him I didn't want to, but he didn't want to give up. He took my arm and tried to physically take me out of the car. I felt anxious and I'm even feeling it now while remembering the scene. He finally gave up after a few minutes of me telling him no and went to the front seat.

Tom and I talked about Henry and how he seemed to be the kind of person who wants his things fast and won't take a no and won't respect other people's boundaries.

Henry moved to Kate's house inmediately, even if he can afford to live alone, by far. Kate was really happy alone in her department, which she described as her ""sanctuary"" but one day he appeared by surprise telling her ""Hey, I'm here to stay"" and that's all. He decided to move to someone else's house, so he did it.

The situation was very stressful for both Tom and I, since a stranger was getting into our family life way too fast and forced. We used to visit Kate into her house and made plans there and suddenly there was a total stranger which made the situation anything but familiar. Not to mention he was still legally married to his (ex)wife. So, we decided to have a conversation with them. To make it shorter, the conversation ended with Tom and I having to get used to the new situation. Henry told us that he was not moving to Kate's department, that we didn't need to expect to see him always there since that would not be appropiate. I asked him if he was staying at his home with his ex wife then and he literally told me yes. Well, guess who lied just to shut our mouths and has been living in Kate's department since that day. There are more details I'm gonna mention in a list to make it shorter, but I really need to mention them since I consider they're important.

Convert what was going to be Tom's room for visit his mom in Henry's office without telling Tom about it. One day Kate and Tom were talking about the furniture he would need and the other there were Henry's furniture.

Tom was talking about his depressed emotional state during a lunch and mentioned he was in ""survival mode"" visibly sad, there was no way to misunderstand it and Herny answered laughing: ""Haha, like in the jungle!""

Forgetting about his two sons even after they told him: ""Dad, you divorced mom, not us"" and obviously play the victim from that comment.

We were celebrating Tom's cousin's (let's call her Lilly) birthday last week having dinner together. It was the first time Henry met or talked to Lilly.  She got some presents, including a cute notebook. Lilly told the family to write something in the notebook and I found appropiate to wait until her ""real"" family finished. Henry hurried to be the first one to write in the first page of the notebook, talking about him being new into the family.

Inviting himself to Lilly's house after 5 minutes of meeting her for the first time by telling ""When we go visit you..."" even if nobody told something about it.

Inviting himself to stay at mine and Tom's future house while we were talking about our plans to move. He literally told us that he would work in the garden and stay there ""As it was my house"". Nobody was talking about coming over or anything.

Being excessively complacent to the point that he won't let us do anything because he wants to look polite and do everything, even taking a glass or water.

Driving too fast, dangerously swerving and brake sharply without caring about the rest of the passangers and people in other cars.

While watching a movie at home, turning around to stare at me for seconds out of nothing, and then continue watching the movie. He did it many times.

There is more but I think you can see the kind of person he is and the situation. Tom and I tried to talk about it with Kate, in a polite way so she doesn't feel attacked but it had the same effect that the conversation about the money. She says we need to get used to it and that we need to meet him more until we're a family. She points to us as the problem since we're ""too closed minded"".

I'm sorry if it was too long but I need to know what someone out of the situation thinks about it and wanted to make sure I can give as many details as I can.

Tom and I have a very good relationship, we live together and our relationship is very healthy. We never argue or anything, but this situation is stressful and I'm worried about Tom. I can see how he's afraid of asking for his money back since his mom gets angry if he doesn't accept her dissuasive answers. I see him stressed and sad because of his missing money and he can't do anything about it.

Be honest, please. Is this my fault? I feel guilty for not being comfortable around Henry and I feel like I'm the problem for not being tolerant enough. Also, I feel bad about Tom's money even if we don't share a bank account and I don't have access to his money but I feel like a bad influence or something.

I would like to know if I'm wrong since I wouldn't like to be a bad person and hurt anyone's feelings.

TLDR: My mother-in-law owes my partner around $5000 and won't give him a single penny after years but won't stop traveling (and spending money in many things) and makes us go take care of her cats when she is out. She also has a new partner who has lots of narcissistic traits and won't respect boundaries and she forces my partner and I to accept him as a family member. Everytime we try to talk about this with her, we get gaslighted and end up feeling guilty.

You have taken out the space bar and dried/cleaned, maybe with some rubbing alcohol, now works fine

Few minutes later, space-bar does not seem to come back up when pressed or doesn't feel 'clicky'


Solution
Assuming no part of the mechanism is broken, there may be some liquid in the two butterfly wings rods that help maintain the plastic once it's pushed up by the plastic

Due to the nature of how tiny these parts are, anything that can inhibit movement on the rods will cause it not to come back up quickly/in a snap.

Just take out the rods and ensure they are also cleaned with rubbing alcohol. 
If the two white element that give it balance on the sides have some residue in them, you'd have to clean those as well.

You can research. You can think hard about your future. That's all reasonable and thoughtful. Even demure. 

**I'm asking you see it out to May/June 2025 if not to August 2025.** 

We owe it to the students who need to graduate with that AA/AS/ASG or BA/BS/MA/MS and PHDs (and more!) to stick around and see them through to the end of this fiscal year.

We can't replace TRIO oriented employees right now - base pay is still set for 2020 range grants.  It's because we are asking for people in some states to work under the poverty level while promising upgrades in living for our students in TRIO with eyes on the prize for the 2025-26 cycle and COL upgrades. To make it we have to stay the course till the last possible moment. 

Here's the thing: 

1. Every bit of media info/misinfo is wildly speculative and borderline prophecy **until Congress and the Senate go back into session in Jan 2025.  They aren't even there now.** Not making choices. Not really doing anything but announcing what they plan to do. 
2. Our students need us MORE THAN EVER to provide them support with the coming break and the Winter break.  We need provide expansive self-care options. We need to encourage them to stay the course.
3. Our students need to be HEARD AND SEEN as individuals by us right now.  Do grades check in all this while you do APR stuff and CONGRADULATE your achievers. 
4. We can't make knee jerk decisions based on our past trauma of being homeless, jobless, and broke. Most low-income, first gen people have CPTSD and PTSD level relationships with the experience of dire, desperate times and lack of basic needs.  Growing up in a chaotic, transactional world of generational poverty scars us WHICH leads to the type of behavior we help our students with - knee-jerk, feral, panic drive responses to stressors that seem insurmountable when in that level of fear, trauma, and state of alertness. Quitting and running away is the NUMBER ONE top - fear response of someone who has experienced trauma - observe that and understand that if you quit, they quit.  We can be stronger than that now. We can use our minds. 
5. We need self-care and reflection right now - not living in fear through our family and friend holidays. It's ok to tell family you don't want to talk about this now. We don't know enough. Ruminating on the fear is not helpful. BUT planning to have positive experiences with family, students, volunteering, and helping others - that's the TRIO way.  Double-down on the good things and magic.

Plus, this gives TRIO staff time to:

1. Hail Mary - once Congress and the Senate go back into session ""we"" shall descend upon them at COE Policy Seminar. And we won't stop. 

2. Look at your finances and savings - start economizing, putting away an emergency fund, and cutting out lifestyle creep.  Pay your debts. Manage those student loans. Look into sustaining healthcare coverage with Healthcare.gov/ACH.

3. Prep your dependent family - remind them there may be a limit you can support them in 2025 and they will have to become providers or supporters themselves. 

4. Prep your admin in how you are going to support your team IF you have to exit with severance, letters of rec, and job re-homing in different departments if possible. (If anything, this might help them ""get real"" about the loss or pause of 1.9 billion in funds received for TRIO programs which is going to hit smaller/poorer colleges hard.) 

5. Gift Others ->>> T**his is THE year to send your DE program officer a physical holiday card.**  Send them a coffee card. Send them a picture of your students AS a card. Remind them of their why and that WE KNOW all that they do.  Plus - Gift your staff.  Ask for help gifting your staff.  Help them feel loved and appreciated, too. 

We can survive this - but using your power and foresight to create the best outcome for your staff - that is where strength lies.  

(I can't tell you how hard the last three weeks have been for me because it required me to start doing research and providing data on things that made me ultimately UNHAPPY and very sad. When my family member came to me wanting to discuss why I was so sad and just playing video games at home or watching movies, but not much else - I tried to say why - but it felt like a massive, giant sack of sadness suddenly dumped on me. I covered my face, my mouth, & my eyes in despair.  And I said ""I can't talk about this right now. It really bothers me. I'm doing my best.""  Every day is challenge with things like this. We are not alone. 

I can absolutely give my colleagues permission if you are feeling so profoundly sad or challenged this year and know you might have to confront people justifying the deletion or long term pause of your entire life's purpose off the face of the country, economy, and demographic you serve - it is OK to tap out and do your own small Friendsgiving or Family-who-Loves-Me and Respects my Boundaries-giving event. 

You do TOO MUCH good for the world to being told you don't matter or your job doesn't matter. Go somewhere where people respect you. Give your disrespected (real and sublime) gifts to your students who actually need warm coats and blankets and food.  Give love. And know you DO matter. You are important. The world and TRIO would be lesser for the lack of you. #trioworks.)",1,1732041207.0,u_TRIOworksFan,0,1.0,False

Nutraville, an American vitamin company, made Volca Burn to help people lose weight.  
  
The product can only be bought on VolcaBurn.com. It helps you lose weight quickly by using a mix of natural ingredients.  
  
Volca Burn works by going after UCP-1, a ""mechanic protein"" in your body. People who are overweight don't use that protein, which makes it very hard to lose weight. A ""red tingle hack"" can help you lose weight by making you take Volca Burn every day.  
  
The official Volca Burn website says that the supplement has helped people lose between 10 and 102 pounds. Some people have even gone down four to eight dress sizes while taking Volca Burn.  
  
Each bottle of Volca Burn costs $59, and you can get your money back if you're not happy with it. A Korean-American doctor named Dr. Yong came up with the vitamin and worked with doctors from all over the world to make it the best weight loss aid possible.

**Peeking Into The World of Volca Burn’s Health Benefits**  
  
Volca Burn may be good for your health in the following ways:

* **Helps your metabolism**

The goal of Volca Burn is to speed up your metabolism so that your body can burn fat more quickly. If your metabolic rate is good, your body will use fat for energy instead of glucose, which means you will lose weight even if you eat whatever you want.

* **Proven to help you lose weight at home**

The pill has been shown to help people lose weight naturally, without having to eat or work out. The supplement's natural herbs and ingredients turn your body into a fire that burns fat, which helps you lose weight.

* **High levels of energy**

Taking Volca Burn on a regular basis has been shown to give you a lot of energy and keep you moving all day. Volca Burn makes sure that your cells are making enough energy for you to keep going by burning fat.

* **Better Mood**

Dr. Roberts says that studies have shown that people's dopamine levels rose and their mood got a lot better after taking the pill daily. In this way, Volca Burn keeps you in a good mood and on track.

* **Low cholesterol and healthy blood pressure**

The vitamin for weight loss does more than its main job; it also helps keep your blood pressure at a healthy level by protecting your arteries. It also helps keep your cholesterol levels in check, which is good for your health.

**Volca Burn Ingredients**  
  
Each tablet of Volca Burn has a mix of seven herbs and plant products. These ingredients come from plants and were picked because they can help with weight loss and turn on the mechanic protein.  
  
Volca Burn has the following ingredients, and Nutraville says this is how they work:

* **Gochugaru**: One of the most important parts of Volca Burn is gochugaru. It grows naturally on the rocky Korean island of Jeju, and people have used it for a long time to get more energy and speed up their metabolism.
* **Luma Leaves**: It is full of vitamin B6, zinc, iron, and other micronutrients that help fight tiredness and give you a lot of energy. Luma leaf was added to Volca Burn by Dr. Yong because it ""boosts the activation of the mechanic protein by 47%,"" which means it burns 5 percent more calories.
* **Irvingia Gabonensis**: This is a plant that is often used in weight loss supplements. Dr. Yong added the fruit to the mix because, among other things, it can get rid of gas, improve digestion, and even lower cholesterol. Irvingia gabonensis was found to have a lot of fiber, which can help you lose weight in a number of ways by Dr. Yong's study. He also found that it makes your body use the mechanic protein to lose weight quickly.
* **Citrus Bioflavonoids**: Bioflavonoids are natural ingredients found in many citrus fruits that help reduce inflammation and protect cells from damage. These antioxidants were turned into a powder by Nutraville, which then added them to Volca Burn. The supplement's maker says that the citrus bioflavonoids can make you feel full, which will help you eat less. Even better, they can help keep your teeth healthy and strong.
* **Berberis Vulgaris**: This herb is famous for how it lowers blood sugar. For weight loss, berberine can help keep blood sugar levels stable, which makes it easier to control your hunger.

Because it doesn't have any soy or dairy, Volca Burn is made from only plants. Nutraville says that all of their products are checked by a third party to make sure they are pure and of good quality.

**So why is it a good idea to buy Volca Burn?**  
  
To write this piece, we talked to people and read a lot of Volca Burn reviews to find out what makes Volca Burn worth buying. People love to buy this natural product for these two main reasons:  
  
**Extra Products for Free**  
  
When you buy packages that include two free extra items, you get twice as much for your money. Some of the free e-books are 17 Korean Secrets That Will Make You Look Younger and Cleanse Your Body and Rewire Your Brain For Faster Weight Loss And Unbreakable Confidence.  
  
The first e-book has secret Korean methods to get rid of stiffness and joint pain, burn fat, keep hair healthy, and look beautiful for a long time. Like Koreans, you will look young and healthy no matter what age you are!  
  
In the second book, you'll learn how to burn fat faster and feel absolutely sure of yourself all the time. The book has Dr. Yong's secret way to stay energetic and a three-step plan to cut down on cravings.  
  
Your weight loss will go faster with these extras, and Volca Burn reviews confirm that they work.

**365-Day Money-Back Promise**  
  
Volca Burn's amazing price is even better when you know you can get your money back in 365 days.  
  
You have a year to try the pill and get in the shape of your dreams thanks to this amazing money-back promise. You can get all of your money back if the pill doesn't help you look younger and more toned or if you have trouble replacing your clothes because you lost so much weight so quickly.  
  
But you have to take the supplement for a year, and Volca Burn reviews say that the best way to do that is to buy a 6-bottle deal twice a year.

**A Guide on How to Take Volca Burn Correctly**  
  
One diet pill in the morning is what Dr. Yong says you should do. That's it. It goes well with coffee or water.  
  
Since Volca Burn burns fat all day, taking it in the morning will keep you ready to go. The best part is that you don't have to give up your favorite foods or work out while taking the supplement. You only need to take one pill a day to get back in shape.

1gv4850,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIBranding/comments/1gv4850/5_brands_that_nailed_their_rebranding/,5 Brands That Nailed Their Rebranding,"Rebranding can be risky, but when done right, it can redefine how a brand connects with its audience. Here are 5 real-world examples of brands that successfully reinvented themselves and the key takeaways for your own branding efforts:

# 1. Dunkin’ Donuts → Dunkin’

In 2018, Dunkin’ dropped “Donuts” from its name to emphasize its broader menu offerings, such as coffee and sandwiches. The simplified name also made the brand feel more modern and approachable.

**Key Takeaway:** Don’t be afraid to evolve with your audience. Simplify your branding to align with current values and product focus.

# 2. Old Spice: From “Your Dad’s Cologne” to Cool and Contemporary

Old Spice transformed its image from a dated “dad brand” to a fresh, youthful, and humorous brand with campaigns like ""The Man Your Man Could Smell Like."" This rebranding focused on bold advertising, updated packaging, and a new tone of voice.

**Key Takeaway:** A well-executed rebranding campaign can completely shift consumer perception, especially when it’s backed by a fresh tone and creative marketing.

# 3. Airbnb: From Couch-Surfing to Belonging Anywhere

Airbnb’s 2014 rebrand introduced the ""Bélo"" symbol, representing belonging and connection. They shifted focus from being a booking platform to promoting unique experiences and global community.

**Key Takeaway:** Your brand should tell a story that resonates emotionally with your audience. Go beyond functionality and connect on a human level.

# 4. LEGO: From Near Bankruptcy to a Global Icon

In the early 2000s, LEGO was struggling financially, but a rebrand refocused the company on its core values: creativity and imagination. Collaborations with franchises like Star Wars and Harry Potter brought LEGO back to life, appealing to kids and adults alike.

**Key Takeaway:** Return to your roots while embracing innovation. Collaborations can breathe new life into your brand.

# 5. Instagram: A Fresh Logo for a Fresh Era

Instagram’s 2016 rebrand replaced the skeuomorphic camera logo with a minimalist, gradient design. This modernized the app’s look and better reflected its focus on creativity and content sharing.

**Key Takeaway:** Visual updates are crucial to staying relevant in a fast-evolving digital world. Keep your brand’s essence but adapt its aesthetic to suit the times.

# What We Can Learn

Rebranding isn’t about changing everything—it’s about evolving to meet the needs of your audience while staying true to your core values. Whether it’s simplifying your name, modernizing your visuals, or shifting your narrative, successful rebrands create lasting impressions.",1,1732041047.0,AIBranding,0,1.0,False

For background I moved back home recently due to a breakup and having to pay bills for two households: my own and a disabled parent's who is unable to work. 

I created my first money bowl in September, doing my first first of the month ritual. The following Thursday I submitted a significant raise request (18-20%) and refreshed my money bowl. That night I had a dream that I'd gotten the raise. Fast forward to October and I haven't heard anything but I'm patient and since I've dreamt that I've already gotten it, I give gratitude for it anyway. I refresh my money bowl, being more specific with my intentions for other things, like paying off the debt on my parents home to avoid losing the house. November rolls around and I still haven't heard anything. First of the month, I reset my bowl but this time I added coffee grounds to it (my intuition told me to add coffee grounds before but I didnt want to seem impatient). The following week parent gets approved for disability. Today I got an email that my raise request was accepted. 

In two and a half Months I've had 4/7 items I petitioned for in my money bowl manifest. 

Because generosity and gratitude have been important to seeing these come to fruition, I plan to give back ASAP. But I'm grateful to be in a position to do so ultimately. 😊

","AYEEE welcome to .. my post? To my life story? Idk welcome to… ME! i know i know, so far it doesn't sound that exciting and more like that one strange uncle you see once a year during family events, that just keeps rambeling about aliens, the goverment, and how pigeons are goverment drones, but keep reading and you might just discover I'm actually your great uncle which went missing 10 years ago. (Or i can play him for 50€ only cash or bitcoin accepted.)

Either way I have heard from some very trustable sources on this subreddit that I should write down some of my hobbies as that's apparently what people do which are considered ""normal"", now im not the biggest fan of just writing everything about me down cause well THIS POST WOULD BECOME A BOOK,(best seller Material? Perhaps, bin Material... Perhaps)

But ill throw some of the basics in there: I love photography, i love filmmaking, nature(taking walks in it and just exploring and propably tripping and breaking my ankle because i have the stability of that one grandparent you thought would really be done after that last stair fall) watching youtube and netflix ,playing games, talking to new people aaand traveling, not because i'm wanted by multiple countries their secret services for a variety of crimes, including but not limited to the ilegal smuggeling of koalas, becvause thats not something id do, which is why im not wanted, really, trust me:)

I don't care about your gender or country but because of timezones i preffer it if your european (Not a must at all though BECAUSE I DO WORK THE NIGHTSHIFT WHICH MEANS MY SCHEDULE IS ALL OVER THE FLOOR) Overall I'm just a social fucking weirdo who always is looking for more people to talk to (NO I AM NOT ADDICTED...SORT OF) oh and German people especially RISE UP, I NEED Y'ALL TO PRACTICE MY GERMAN.

You don’t have to be a social expert at all, its more then okay if your a bit shy as long as your just actually interested in talking and not as dry as the ground in most of the world will be in a few more years (GOD DONT WE LOVE CLIMATE CHANGE ? I MISS SNOW DURING CHRISTMAS, I CANT BE THE ONLY ONE??) and even tho i love to fuck around and just have fun im also Always here for you if there is heavier stuff on your mind (i’m quite a good listner and Always try to help) .

I love bringing laughter into people their lives but ill also be your totally not certified in any way therapist(I WILL EVEN GIVE YOU SKITTLES AND CALL THEM SPECIAL ANTI DEPRESSANTS, LIKE EXCLUSIVE SHIT, HELL ILL EVEN TAKE YOUR HEALTHINSURANCE)

So it’s been around 2 years now that we are together. We also live together for 3 months now. 

I had couple bad years before I met her. Family scammed me out of savings and I got into debt. When I met her I was already halfway trough fixing all of this. With a good income and all. I managed to get rid of debt and I keep studying because when I get my title, for me it’s automatically a huge pay increase. So overall things are looking good. 

But I’m at the finish line and there’s a lot of pressure. I have final exams in April. And I have to pay for a drivers license. I wanted to get a car for a long time. And my coworkers husband has a driving school and gave me a good offer. All of these things will improve the quality of our lives. I will have way more money. I have enough money now but I just have to pay these things before anything else. And the university is super expensive. Thankfully I didn’t have to take a loan or anything. I can set aside enough from my monthly income. But this doesn’t leave too much to spare.

It doesn’t mean I’m cheap on her or something. Just two weeks back I took her out to dinner and bought her a nice Tommy Hilfiger wallet. But I can’t afford long trips and hotels now. 

And she gets upset about this. Keeps saying that we need to find a compromise. But I’m trying to do that. I told we can go for a shorter one day trip for example. I looked for nice places around us too. But none of that was good enough for her. Because she feels like she needs to adapt to what I want. But we can have 2 exotic vacations next year if I just finish up these things. But we keep fighting about how she feels like we are always home, that I don’t try to compromise with her. That it’s always her adapting to me. And I don’t feel like that’s the case. I go to all her family gatherings and events she comes up with, she wants to be at her parents place almost every weekend for a coffee and stuff. I’m not that into this but I go with her often because it’s important for her. I’ll go to a bar with her once a month at least, even if I’m an introvert and hate bars haha. 

I got angry a bit and told her that if she wants the trip maybe she could cover it. When we got together she was broke and I was paying for everything. Taking her to trips etc. I know I’m a man and should be the one providing but I really need to pay for the school and stuff. 

I’m really trying but she just isn’t happy. So I thought that maybe we just aren’t a good match and that I don’t want to hurt her with these things. And that maybe we should break up. And after that she’s suddenly okay with everything. Which I saw before, she’s gonna pretend it’s cool and then go off on me again in the future. 

TLDR: GF wants to go on trips, I need to pay for university. After that we can have as many trips as we want. But she wants them now and I have to focus on my future. What am I doing wrong here? Should I try more and take her somewhere? Or would it be smarter to just leave?

1gv3rsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gv3rsh/has_anybody_else_found_their_shadow_in_strange/,Has anybody else found their shadow in strange places?,"I didn’t think much of it at first. Who notices their shadow, really? But now, I wish I’d paid more attention.

It started about a month ago. I was out on a walk, enjoying the rare sunny day, when I noticed something strange. My shadow wasn’t moving right. I lifted my arm to shield my eyes from the sun, and there it was—a delay. A fraction of a second where the shadow just… didn’t follow me.

I laughed it off. Maybe it was a weird angle or my imagination. But that wasn’t the last time it happened.

A week later, I was leaving a coffee shop when I saw it again—or thought I did. My shadow stretched out on the sidewalk like normal, except… I swear it turned. Like, it shifted on its own, as if it were looking at me. I actually stopped walking and stood there, staring down at the ground like an idiot. A few people gave me funny looks, but I shook it off. Shadows don’t just look at you.

Then things started getting worse.

I started seeing it in places I wasn’t. Once, I was driving home from work when I passed a street corner and froze. There it was, my shadow—or something just like it—on the pavement. The posture, the tilt of the head, even the way it slouched when I was tired. But I wasn’t walking. I was in my car.

I looked back, but it was gone.

After that, I started watching. Really watching. That’s when I realized it was changing. When I looked in mirrors, my reflection’s shadow didn’t always match what I was doing. I’d raise my arm, but my shadow’s hand would stay down—or worse, twitch, like it was trying to catch up but couldn’t.

Last week, my roommate asked me if I’d gone out at night. She said she saw me standing in the kitchen around 3 AM, just… standing there, staring at the fridge. But I hadn’t left my bed.

Then a friend called me in tears. “You were outside my house,” she said, her voice trembling. “You were just standing there, staring up at my bedroom window. Your eyes… God, your eyes weren’t right. What’s going on?”

I didn’t have an answer for her.

I’ve started to feel… off. Tired all the time, like something’s draining me. Sometimes, I catch it—my shadow—doing things I didn’t do. The other day, I reached for my coffee, but in the corner of my eye, I swear my shadow flinched.

The worst part? It’s started showing up in photos. At first, it was just in the background—barely noticeable. But now, it’s obvious. In one picture, I’m smiling at the camera, but my shadow is standing behind me, its head tilted at a sharp angle. Like it’s watching me.

I’ve tried to find answers. Folklore, paranormal blogs, forums—anything that might explain what’s happening. The closest thing I’ve found is an old myth about shadows gaining independence when a person’s soul is damaged. If they get strong enough, they can replace you entirely.

I don’t know if I believe it, but I can feel it growing stronger. Every day, I feel weaker—like I’m fading.

Tonight, I saw it standing across the room from me. Not attached to my feet, not part of the wall, just standing there in the corner, perfectly still. I don’t know how long it’s been watching me, but I’m scared to close my eyes.

I think it’s waiting for something. I don’t know how long I stayed frozen, staring at it. My shadow, standing there, detached, just… watching me. Its head tilted at an unnatural angle, almost curious.

I wanted to move—run, scream, do anything—but my body wouldn’t cooperate. The air felt thick, pressing against me, and I swear I could hear something. A low hum, like static, but deeper, vibrating in my chest.

And then it moved.

Not a shift or a twitch like before. It stepped forward.

I scrambled back, knocking over my chair, but it didn’t stop. It moved with an eerie fluidity, almost like it was gliding across the floor. As it got closer, the humming grew louder, and I realized it wasn’t just sound. It was a voice.

It was whispering.

I couldn’t make out the words at first, but then they became clearer. It was speaking in my voice. “Why are you so afraid?” it asked, tilting its head again.

“Stay back!” I shouted, my voice cracking.

It paused, as if considering my words, then crouched low, mimicking the exact way I had when I used to hide as a kid. “I’m not going anywhere,” it said, the corners of its shape shifting, almost as if it were smiling. “You brought me here.”

“I didn’t bring you!” I yelled, pressing myself against the wall.

It tilted its head the other way. “You did. Every doubt. Every fear. Every crack you let grow inside yourself. I’m just filling the space you left behind.”

My breathing was shallow, my heart hammering in my chest. It wasn’t just mimicking me anymore—it was claiming to be me.

“What do you want?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

It straightened up, towering over me now. “To finish what you started,” it said. “To make you whole.”

I didn’t understand at first, but then it stepped closer, and I realized something horrifying. As it moved, I felt weaker. My legs trembled, my vision blurred, and I felt like I was being pulled into a void.

I stumbled, clutching at my chest. “What are you doing to me?”

“I’m taking what’s mine,” it said. “You don’t need it anymore.”

And that’s when it lunged.

I don’t know how I’m still here. I remember darkness—cold and endless—and the feeling of something pressing down on me, suffocating me. I woke up hours later, sprawled on the floor, my body drenched in sweat.

But something’s wrong.

I don’t feel like myself anymore. My thoughts feel… distant, like I’m observing them instead of thinking them. When I look in the mirror, my reflection seems off. It stares just a little too long, its eyes darker, emptier.

And my shadow?

It’s back, attached to me like it should be. But sometimes, when I turn away, I feel it move on its own—stretching, curling, reaching.

I think it won. 

It’s been a few days and things have only gotten worse.

I tried to pretend everything was normal. I went to work, hung out with friends, even forced myself to laugh at stupid jokes. But deep down, I know it’s still with me. I can feel it—this weight pressing down on me, like I’m not the only one in my own skin anymore.

The whispers haven’t stopped.

They’re louder now, more distinct, and they’re not just in my head. I’ll hear them at the edge of my hearing when I’m alone in my apartment, or even in the car when the radio’s off. It’s my voice, but it’s saying things I’d never say.

“You don’t belong here.”
“This isn’t your life anymore.”
“Let go.”

Last night, I woke up to find myself standing in the middle of my living room. I don’t remember getting out of bed. I don’t remember anything. I was just… there. The lights were off, the moonlight casting long shadows across the floor.

And mine was wrong.

It wasn’t connected to me. It was beside me, standing upright like a person. For a moment, I thought I was hallucinating, but then it moved. It stepped closer, and I swear I felt the coldness radiating from it.

It leaned in, its face—or whatever passed for a face—mere inches from mine. I wanted to run, to scream, but I couldn’t move. It whispered something I couldn’t quite understand, and then it melted back into the darkness.

When I finally regained control, I collapsed onto the floor, shaking. I don’t know how much longer I can take this.

I went back to the old forums I found, desperate for answers. Most of the posts were useless—people calling me crazy, telling me it was sleep paralysis or some psychological break. But one comment stood out.

It was from an anonymous user. They said they’d been through something similar. They called it a “shadow parasite,” a kind of entity that feeds on your energy, your identity. It doesn’t just want to replace you—it wants to erase you, to absorb everything that makes you you.

The only way to stop it, they said, is to confront it. To force it back into submission. But they didn’t explain how, and their account was deleted shortly after.

I’ve been thinking about that all day. What does “confronting it” even mean? How do you fight something that isn’t flesh and blood? Something that knows your every thought, every fear?

I’m running out of time.

Just an hour ago, I was staring at my reflection in the bathroom mirror, trying to convince myself that I’m still in control. But then my reflection blinked—and I didn’t.

It smiled.

Not a normal smile, either. It was wrong. Too wide, too sharp, stretching my face into something that didn’t look human.

And then it spoke.

“Soon,” it said, its voice echoing in my head. “You’ll see.”

I smashed the mirror.

I don’t know what’s going to happen tonight, but I’m done running. If confronting it is the only way to end this, then I’ll do it. I’ve left this post open on my laptop, just in case.

If I don’t update, you’ll know I didn’t make it.

And if you ever see your shadow move on its own, run. Don’t let it in. Don’t let it win.",8,1732039939.0,nosleep,2,0.9,False
