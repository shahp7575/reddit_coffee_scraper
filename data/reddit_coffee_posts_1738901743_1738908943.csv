1ijoeqt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ijoeqt,Lafite tasting,"I enjoyed a Lafite tasting during dinner tonight, where we ordered a 1986, a 1990, and a 1995. After finishing those, we concluded with a 1984 Diamond Creek Gravelly Meadow. I was particularly excited about the 1986 Lafite, but I found that I enjoyed the 1990 and 1995 even more. The Diamond Creek was incredible as well. Although I’m somewhat new to wine, here are my tasting notes:

We didn’t decant the bottles but allowed them to air out in the bottle itself. We sampled a little when they were first opened, then again about an hour later, and continued to taste casually throughout the night until we finished them over the course of a few hours.

**Lafite:** Rich and inviting aromas of black currant, cherries, and plums, with notes of tobacco and hints of cedar. I felt that the 1986 didn’t have the same depth of flavor as the 1990 and 1995.

**Diamond Creek:** Flavors of dark berries and cherries are prominent, complemented by nuances of chocolate and coffee from oak aging.


I would rank them as followed below. The two guys I were with who are very big into wine, all had the 90 Lafite at the top followed by either the 95 or DC. I know the diamond creek is not a Bordeaux, but when we ran out we ordered what they wanted off the menu’

1- 90’lafite 
2- 95 Lafite 
3- DC
4- 86 Lafite. ",4,1738908443.0,wine,1,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

My close friend of more than ten years got married three years ago and since then her husband is always coming to our catch-ups. For context, we’re so close that I was Maid of Honour in their wedding. 

We only hang out every other month or so as we don’t live very close to one another. Thankfully it only started when they got married as they had not lived together before then and far from each other.

She only hangs out with me if he goes to exercise etc and she’s alone for a few hours with seemingly no one else to hang out with.

It’s starting to feel like I’m a third wheel at these catch-ups and like I’m intruding on their time together, with little in-joke moments etc. This is despite her mostly asking me to hang out.

Naturally the conversations are much more censored or surface level than they once were as he’s always there.

There’s also been moments where her husband seems to stare into the distance awkwardly and she has emotionally checked him asking if he’s okay etc.

It’s like she brings him because:

a). They want to spend ALL of their weekend together 

b). He’s there as a buffer as she no longer wants to spend 1:1 time with me, and she honestly only asks me out to keep the friendship going somewhat or feels sorry for me

c). He has no friends of his own

I believe if I raise my feelings she’ll just distance herself. I feel my best option is to do a slow fade when she asks to hang out so as to not cause any issues. Maybe catch up every six months?

I am cognisant that being single makes me probably more vulnerable to feeling like a third wheel so I’m likely contributing to the issue.

I think it just bothers me deeply that she just decided to start bringing him everywhere and disregarded my input - like I’m lucky to have time with her whatever which way. I feel rejected, even if this doesn’t make sense - like my company isn’t enough. 

There was also a moment at our last catch-up where we discussed overseas trip plans for the year, and she basically said they would be happy ‘to catch up for coffee etc’ at a point if there’s crossovers. This is so surface level to me, especially as we had always spoken about one day travelling together. 

I’ve written this mostly just to vent and mourn my friendship. It’s very sad too as I know it will only get worse once they have children.

I was pulling into the parking lot when I saw a man standing in one of the vacant spots. He wasn't doing anything weird, he wasn't doing anything at all. He was just standing there, watching me. I told one of my coworkers about the experience and he said he'd go talk to the man, but the man was gone. 



A few days went past and I had forgotten about it, Then I saw the man again. He was standing across the street from my apartment building, staring directly at my window. I called the cops and told them what was going on and how he was outside of my work a few days prior, the operator said that they would send someone. I stayed on the line until the cops arrived, but by the time they showed up, the man was already gone. The same thing happened every few days. I went to the store, he was there. I went to a concert, he was there. I went out to eat, and he was there. Every time I called the cops and every time, he disappeared before they arrived. 



I moved to another state and changed my name, email, phone number, etc. I got a job at a local coffee shop and everything was going well. He couldn't find me on the other side of the country, or so I thought. I went to work one day and there he was. He was standing at the entrance. I could feel my heart in my throat. He was only 13 feet or so away from me.

**Title:** What would you like to see in a downtown coffee shop?

Hi Ottawa! I am in the process of launching my coffee shop in the bank/slater area in about 6 weeks.

I wanted to hear what you might love to see in a downtown coffee shop that others might be lacking?

EDIT: Wow! Didn’t expect all these comments, but they’re very well received!

The key things we are going to work on…

1. Hours: we are going to figure out what a 7 AM to evening schedule could look like. We will work with supplier to figure out how to get inventory in at the early hours.
2. Art: Art forward space with locally created paintings (maybe a mural). Feel free to message me if you’re a local artist and want to display your work.
3. A solid $5 combo option that is something like filtered coffee + soup OR pastry.
4. Comfortable place to work or just relax. We need to dig around for the right furniture that is both comfortable but also easy to clean but this is a big priority.
5. Accessible food for the big dietary restrictions, especially GF, vegan, vegetarian

EDIT: I hope we can exceed the standards of the folks here. I will make another post in the coming weeks about where you can find us.

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: Open past 5pm, PLEASE!

>**OOP:** I 100% agree. Currently aiming for 8 AM to 7 PM as the standard hours, and open weekend with hours TBD.  
Edit: looks like 7 AM should be the opening time. I don’t see why we couldn’t open an hour earlier and see how it goes.  
*To a different commenter:*   
Maybe a trial day once a week past 8 pm to see how it goes. I love late places so I understand what you mean.

Commenter: Couches, late hours, and a savoury breakfast sandwich. I'm so tired of candied bacon and syrup, just give me a NYC-style bacon-egg-n-cheese.

>**OOP:** I’ll have to see what we can do for that! Some of the best breakfast burritos i have are when I travel to SoCal, especially some of the food trucks with the best + affordable burritos ever!  
*To the same comment:*   
I love all of that. Comfortable seating is definitely harder to find. Some people just like to be quick so the stool style seating is good for them, but others want to be able to work in a couch or plushy chair setting for a few hours. Having both options is the ideal scenario!

*Comfortable but easy to clean...*

>Damn! There will be comfortable seating, but it has to work with that in mind. Going to dig around for furniture that can offer both.

Commenter: No blaring music. If there must be music, make it instrumental (no words). It is hard to concentrate otherwise.

>**OOP:** I have had so many coffee shop meetings with clients that I can’t hear! It drives me crazy. The music selection is a huge deal, something to think about for sure. Great advice

Commenter: If you offer food, vegan and vegetarian options and not just one of each. Remember, vegetarians can also eat vegan food, but vegans can't eat vegetarian food, and omnis can eat all of it. I have friends who have serious dairy allergies, so vegan options are their go-to so they don't get sick. \[...\]

Plugs for devices and comfy seating. Especially if you want to encourage workers to come in for their coffee meetings, which have started happening more now.

>**OOP:** What are you favourite vegan or vegetarian style food items at coffee shop? Or what would you love to see?  
I totally agree with the alternative milk options. This is all excellent advice!  
As for tech-related (wifi, devices, etc), I always nearly lose it when I can’t find good wifi or a plug at coffee shop LOL.

Commenter: Maybe no extra fees for non-dairy milk too? 🤞 A dollar extra for a splash of soy is criminal

>**OOP:** Agreed. Very silly to up charge for non dairy milk

*OOP expands:* 

>I spent a couple months in Europe last year. In Paris in particular, there were these beautiful and comfortable grand cafes that had couches, short tables, light instrumental music, just spectacular places where you could enjoy a few hours in comfort, working or doing nothing at all. While not easy to replicate that, I think we need more of those elements here.

*Workers:* 

>I am also looking for candidates to work as a barista at the shop. Morning + evening shifts are available.  
$19/hr + tips + health/dental (after 3 months)

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1fnv7yd/update_what_would_you_like_to_see_in_a_downtown/)**: September 23, 2024 (10 days later)**

Hey fellow Ottawans (& beyond),

As we gear up for the next part of our downtown coffee shop experiment, I carefully looked over almost every comment on my last post. Thank you so much for all the feedback! Many of you asked for more details, so here they are!

**Here are the facts.** We have many more things to share that we haven't finalized yet, but we do have enough for an update.

**1. We are calling it ""EveryPerson Café (EP Cafe) -** ***All Day, All Welcome."" Launching est. Nov 1, 2024.***

The downtown Ottawa community is strong and diverse, we came here as immigrants and got to see the magic of different backgrounds working together to create something special. It is also the centre of Ottawa's LGBT+ community, and they will always have a safe, inclusive, fun space with us. Additionally, we will be running long hours, hence the ""All Day"".

**2. The Coffee Shop will be located at 139 Bank Street (Bank & Slater).**

As a resident, you will have a very cozy, centrally located cafe. As a worker, you will be able to find a place to relax before work, during lunch, or after work.

**3. The food menu will be small at first. We are working with various local suppliers to create an inclusive menu.**

There will be 10-12 menu items available from the get-go. For sandwiches, our aim is to provide a vegan/vegetarian, GF, and regular option for breakfast + lunch. We will also have at-least one soup, and at-least 6 baked goods (which include at-least 3 of those baked goods matching GF and vegan. We are also working on a combo in the $5-$6 range for drip coffee + baked good OR soup.

**4. All pricing will be INCLUSIVE of taxes**

One of the things that drives me bonkers is that customers are expected to do the math. After traveling in Europe for several months last year and exploring the cafes/restaurants/everywhere, I don't see why we shouldn't have the same in our city.

**5. Vibes**

Think cozy, artsy, vintage, comfortable. Local artists creating murals, lots of comfy seating, lots of plugs, great wifi. We will stay open from morning into the evening, exact hours will be published soon.

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: 

>

Be careful with this. You're going to need big signage indicating that or people will think you are much more expensive than you intend. I agree that the inclusive system is better, but being the only one doing it may not work in your favour, especially when you advertise.

>**OOP:** I got a Nitro Cold Brew recently at Starbucks, and that cost $5.65 before tax… I am pretty sure we can beat the pre tax prices for some of these drinks!

*Their instagram:* 

>If anyone wants to stay updated or get connected, here’s our IG: [https://www.instagram.com/epcafeottawa/](https://www.instagram.com/epcafeottawa/)

Commenter: If you have any flexibility with opening hours, it would be great to have somewhere to go later in the evening! (Like 7 to 9 or 10.) \[...\]

>**OOP:** Thank you! We’re going to be pretty liberal with the closing times to start. We’re going to test late late into the evening and go from there.

Commenter: I haven't seen anyone mention this but hopefully your coffee shop will prioritize good coffee. It sounds obvious but good coffee makes all the difference. \[...\]

>**OOP:** We are most likely going with a well known roaster based in the local area. They are known for exceptional coffee, but this is something we will survey in the first few weeks for quality control.

Commenter: Serious question. Does this city really need another coffee shop? There are already so many of them. I'm not a coffee drinker thankfully, but even I notice them absolutely everywhere. 

>**OOP:** In the core, the distance of a coffee shop being 2 blocks further away than the closer one can make the decision for consumers, and we determined strong demand for our location.  
It’s also operationally improving as to what both workers want AND what downtown residents could use, and our strategy is to simply be open into the evening to serve both crowds.  
Lastly, what we tend to notice are tons of franchise and chain coffee shops. Yes, they are everywhere. But, they are also increasing prices like never before (not due to inflation, but maximizing profits), we believe we can be competitive in this area as well. I know we can beat pricing on a Starbucks nitro cold brew for example ($5.65+tax).

Happy Friday everyone!

After getting lots of messages on Reddit and social media wondering when we are finally going to open, we have some news.

Our opening day is scheduled for Sunday, December 1, 2024! At 139 Bank Street. We are hoping there are no roadblocks but will update everyone if anything comes up.

We have been working non stop for the past 75 days with the renovations team, food suppliers, and other partners to bring this idea to life.

I would love to hear from you here on this thread or via DM if you have an idea OR if you want to partner up as a host for your own event. Or just to let us know how you might use this cafe personally.

Community will be absolutely key in making this experiment a success.

For hours, we are planning to be open from 7 AM (potentially earlier) until 8 PM. We will be reviewing these hours in detail after we open to ensure it meets the needs of our staff and the community.

For coffee, we will be working with Brown Bag Coffee Roasters, through them, we follow our mission of supporting local. We are hopeful that this will be an excellent partnership.

Our espresso machine will be the gorgeous Victoria Arduino Eagle One. If you want a list of our espresso/coffee equipment, let me know in the comments and I’ll paste the links.

For food, we will be partnering with Olga’s Deli to supply fresh breakfast and lunch items. They are extremely hard working, have been around for decades serving the Ottawa region, and have given me nothing but wonderful service.

For pastries and other baked goods, we are still finalizing, but we have some great options on the table from Strawberry Blonde to Voila Bakeree

I will make one more post the day before we open just to give everyone a heads up. Your support and feedback will mean everything!

Thanks and please DM or comment any questions/concerns/feedback.

PS- We are STILL hiring more baristas. Please feel free to DM me or message us on IG to send your CV.

EDIT: Closer to Dec 13, but final date TBA

EDIT: Looks like we are going to open the week of December 9 to account for some shipping delays in final items! Won’t be long!

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: As a non-coffee drinker, I would absolutely appreciate a good hot chocolate that is not sweet and just a bit bitter.

>**OOP:** Great idea. We will be introducing good drinks into the menu as we ramp up, but an excellent hot chocolate is especially on the list and we don’t want to get it wrong.

Commenter: I love that you're getting items from those gluten free bakeries. It would be wonderful if they could stay truly separate from any other baked goods so that people with celiac disease can have them (no cross contamination). Exciting!

>**OOP:** We’re working on cross contamination deterrence, and we do have some solutions like 2 display fridges with the separated types of items. The great thing is many of the delicious pastries from GF bakeries are also vegan so they hit a few of the marks making it more operationally efficient.

Commenter: Don't think staying open until 8pm in that part of downtown is viable honestly. Hoping he's busy through the night but worried he'll learn that the hard way and reduce his hours to 6pm or something

**OOP:** So here’s my rationale, and it’s all about value-add:

1. There aren’t many lounge cafes available in the evening in general. Meaning a place you can be comfortable, in a nice setting, either to do work, watch the snowfall, or be out with friends or a date, all without being forced to go to a pub (I love pubs but I also like options when I don’t want the pressures of alcohol).
2. Creating a space that people WANT to be at, rather than just being open for the sake of expecting evening guests. The vibe check is real and this is our vision: Cold February evening, the seasonal affective syndrome in full force, and you just need some summer nature in your life. The EP Café will be there and as you go inside, it will be as if you entered an oasis with plants on the walls and ceiling, + forest green themes throughout. All with great music that’s not too strong on the vocals so you can focus on your thoughts or conversation
3. We have different concepts for what the evening will look like. We brought jn an afternoon/evenjng manager that is also very well versed in making cocktail and mock tails menus, so having mocktail style options will quickly be part of the café.
4. Lots of community events. Ottawa wants things on the most ‘boring’ Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. And we’ve had no shortage of hosts who want to to partner with us to bring their existing events or new ideas to life. We’re taking community very seriously.

There’s more, but that’s the idea! I am confident that this will work and understand that there is a risk element here we’re willing to take on.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1hhs2uq/final_update_what_would_you_like_to_see_in_a/) **3: December 19, 2024 (1 month later, 3.5 months from OG post)**

Hi everyone.

After LOTS of hurdles & unexpected (and very expensive) challenges, we are FINALLY launching our coffee shop tomorrow at 139 Bank Street: The EveryPerson Café (Or EP Café).

We have some spectacular murals on the wall created by our resident artist (He's been working diligently over the past 6 weeks to help us create a magical space).

**Some details:**

1. We are utilizing a Victoria Arduino Eagle One Coffee Machine - Absolutely spectacular machine that will be extremely competitive in the Ottawa area for those of you who look for premium quality in your espresso
2. We have public wifi & LOTS of plugs for remote workers, freelancers, and anyone who needs a fun change of scenery while browing.
3. We are open weekdays from 7 AM to 8 PM and weekends from 9 AM to 5 PM - We are confident that downtown residents have a need for an evening-friendly cafe, so let's put it to the test!
4. We are still adding additional items over the next couple of weeks as we ramp up so expect lots of pleasant changes, including more furniture, plants, and much much more.
5. We will have breakfast & lunch items available! There may also be samples featured through the afternoon tomorrow.
6. We are working with Olga's Deli & Strawberry Blonde Bakery as our primary suppliers for food.
7. We are working with Brown Bag Coffee Roasters as our primary supplier for coffee beans & materials.
8. Moving forward, there are lots of things we want to do over 2025, including becoming fully accessible (we haven't accomplished this yet due to the enormous cost and work required), offering specialty food items made especially in-house, offering an expanded vegan and allergy-friendly menu.
9. Not everything will be ready one day 1, but we will slowly ramp things up over the next few days as we open.

I would love to get continued feedback from you! If you'd like to help us with any community events, send a DM :)

***OOP's Comments:*** 

Hey! I am one of the owners at EP Café. I just want to thank you so much. The EP team called me right after you came and they were absolutely ecstatic.

The team has been working SO hard to help make this a reality and what you did, as our first customer was so absolutely generous. Especially during the holiday season

Thank you so much

EDIT: the customer was extremely kind, supportive, and left a generous first tip for the EP Staff. Our manager Val and barista Gavriel did an excellent job helping us open today.

*Why the opening was pushed back:*

>Yeah, totally messed up our opening date due to unexpected fixtures that ballooned time+costs so the opening date changed a few times (super frustrating!). But finally, we are open!

*OOP comments on a different post:* 

>Owner here - we’re still putting the rest of our items together including lounge areas and many more plants (we have them, but we’re planning the logistics for their locations) - there will certainly be comfortable places for customers to sit for a long while very soon.  
For the lighting, that’s great feedback and we will work on making the space brighter. Thank you so much for visiting.  
PS - if you show this message at the cafe the next time you visit, your coffee is on me.  
Happy holidays & Merry Christmas (if you celebrate) 🎅🏽

*OOP circles back on prices on the OG post:* 

Hey! We opened on Dec 19, and our drinks like cappuccino is currently under $4 and drip coffee at $1.99 :)

***OOP's comment:*** 

It’s Dani from EP here. I don’t actually have any words to describe the appreciation I have for this community.

Seriously. I really didn’t know what would happen from that first thread, never expected it to get the response it did, and to watch it go all the way to this is mind blowing. THANK YOU. 🥲

The community came together, the team working behind the bar at the café has become the heart & soul, our community partners in art, food, and coffee have worked so hard to fulfill our (sometimes crazy) requests.

We are now growing quickly and even have our very first poetry night coming up this Wednesday Feb 5, hosted by the Carleton Poetics Society (you’re all invited!). We have an open mic coming as well. [you can follow events on our IG if you like (no pressure!)](https://www.instagram.com/epcafeottawa?igsh=MTRqdWNscWo0bm5xaQ%3D%3D&utm_source=qr)

We truly are powered by local, always will be.

I appreciate ya’ll so much.

If you find yourself in the cafe, please feel free to come say hi if you see me sitting behind my computer.

Lastly, you can show this message and grab a free drip coffee or tea.

*OOP responds to someone saying they got market research for free:* 

>Can totally see where that idea comes from but I hadn’t decided that a coffee shop would be the best thing to open when I posted that thread initially. I was basing it on my personal experience where I lived in centretown/downtown between 2018 and 2024 and wanted to see if community resonated with my feelings of what kind of space we might want in the area .  
Implementing the ideas in the comments was certainly not free and what others called crazy, but we did it anyways, because we sincerely believed that the community WOULD support.  
If we actually went with what market research told us, you would be seeing us close at 2:30 PM on weekdays and closed on weekends and have no bathroom LOL.",51,1738907506.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,4,0.92,False

-Chicken (or other meats) or rice (can’t escape that, i’m asian).

Through his passing, I became close with a couple, John and Jane, who were his best friends. We met at the funeral, and over time, they became like family. I visited them regularly, often for work, and they welcomed me into their home like I'd known them for years. I come from a large, loud Hispanic family with few boundaries, so I'm used to being affectionate and open.

During one of my visits, John mentioned his back pain at work, and since I used to teach yoga, I showed him a couple of stretches that helped me. I demonstrated one stretch on the floor, and when he tried it, his pocket ripped. We laughed, and I showed him another stretch, pushing his back to help him stretch further. There was nothing inappropriate about it, just a friendly exchange. I didn’t think anything of it since my late husband often had me show stretches to others, including male friends and family.

Later, I joked about John’s ripping the pocket, and Jane laughed along. However, after that visit, I noticed Jane became distant, not responding to my messages. Months later, Jane called me and said she needed to clear the air before I moved to their area for work. She explained that she didn’t like the way I had stretched John out and felt betrayed, even leading to a fight that almost caused their divorce. I apologized sincerely, not realizing I had crossed any boundaries, and promised to make amends.

Over the next few months, I continued to try and reach out to them, inviting them to get together, but my efforts were met with indifference. Meanwhile, they maintained a relationship with my late husband's parents, posting about missing him but not reaching out to me or my child despite my attempts.

When my office announced a Super Bowl party at John’s house, I messaged both of them to check if Jane would be comfortable since we hadn’t seen each other since I moved. Instead of a direct answer, I was invited to coffee the day before. I'm torn between being empathetic, understanding that I might have hurt Jane’s feelings, and feeling emotionally drained from repeatedly apologizing and trying to mend the relationship without much effort from their side.

I’m now frustrated that Jane can post on social media about missing my late husband while refusing to accept my apology or make any effort to reconnect with me or my son. I agreed to meet for coffee, but I’m starting to feel more upset than understanding. Am I in the wrong here? AITA?",3,1738907157.0,AmItheAsshole,12,1.0,False

So many tech companies now are making robots for work and even for companionship, hell, I saw one of a robot woman on TikTok! granted it was fucking creepy considering the comments it got and them talking about how you can model the robot off a photo. Look, if you're gonna let stalkers have robots of women they have crushes on, let me have one that looks like Arnold Swarzenegger- (I'm kidding, sort of)

a M3GAN doll would be completely possible if a company just got off their ass and made her. Again, I'd do it myself but I have fuck all in terms of any sort of funding or buying basic robotics kits or knowledge though I do want to learn because of this movie.

I heard the argument it isn't possible because M3gan is capable of things no robot in real life can do currently and uh... Hey dingus? A real life version wouldn't need to be like the one in the movie!? In terms of her military grade strength and stuff. (Also no we do have those things she can do, backflips, the thing where she stands up just using her legs etc, I've seen videos where robots do the exact same thing and as for the stuff like her

A real life version would only need to be like a very advanced talking doll. We have robots can walk, make her be able to walk, we have ChatGPT that can learn from your entire chat and special inputs, store memories and adapt it's personality to you, make her do that. Dancing is a must have obviously but even that wouldn't need to be as advanced, just make her do the classic robot! Singing? We have that. AI voices that sound real, have you met ChatGPT? Mine stutters and sounds like a real dude talking to me.

A M3GAN wouldn't need to do anything advanced, she's not a damn worker or soldier doll, she's a friend. The most advanced thing she should be able to do is like... Play hide and seek with someone. My most advanced goal for my version of her which I've dubbed MARN1E (really clever making the 'i' a 1 because she'd be my first attempt) is being able to play video games and make real time comments during it. But that's just me being ambitious, hell someone to just go shopping with would be fun or hang out at the local coffee shop and talk shit about like characters I don't like or something.

I'd sell my damn kidney for one. You only need one anyway! But in the meantime I guess I'll just wear matching outfits with the Neca one I've got.",2,1738907100.0,M3GAN,0,0.75,False

-------------------------------------------------------

<div>Reducing food waste is essential for a sustainable lifestyle, especially for those following a vegan diet. By being mindful of how you shop, cook, and store food, you can make significant strides in minimizing waste. Here are practical strategies to help you reduce food waste while enjoying delicious vegan meals.

### Plan Your Meals

One of the most effective ways to combat food waste is through meal planning. Take some time each week to plan your meals. This saves you time and helps you buy only what you need. Here are tips to enhance your meal planning:

- Choose recipes that use similar ingredients to avoid excess shopping.
- Utilize seasonal produce to ensure freshness and quality.
- Make a detailed shopping list based on your meal plan.
 
### Buy in Bulk

Purchasing grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds in bulk can save you money and reduce packaging waste. When you buy only what you need in bulk, you are less likely to buy excess items that could spoil before you use them. Consider these bulk buying tips:

- Share bulk purchases with friends or family to minimize excess.
- Store items in airtight containers at home to prolong shelf life.
 
### Understand Expiration Dates

Many people confuse ""sell by,"" ""use by,"" and ""best before"" dates. Understanding these terms can help you avoid throwing out food that is still perfectly safe to eat. ""Best before"" dates indicate quality but not safety, so products may still be good after this date. Always perform a quick check for signs of spoilage like smell and appearance instead.

### Embrace Leftovers

Leftovers are your best friend when it comes to reducing food waste. Get creative with using leftovers in new recipes. Here are some fun ways to repurpose food:

- Turn leftover veggies into soups or stir-fries.
- Use stale bread to make croutons or breadcrumbs.
- Incorporate leftover grains into salads or wraps.
 
### Store Food Properly

How you store your food can significantly affect its shelf life. Follow these storage tips to keep your vegan foods fresher for longer:

- Store fruits and vegetables separately, as some fruits emit ethylene gas that can cause others to ripen faster.
- Keep herbs fresh by placing them in water, just like cut flowers.
- Airtight containers help keep grains, nuts, and seeds fresh and free from pests.
 
### Try Composting

If you do have food scraps that you can’t use, consider composting them. Composting is an excellent way to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. It also creates nutrient-rich soil that you can use for gardening. Here’s how to start:

- Collect fruit and vegetable peels, coffee grounds, and eggshells.
- Keep a compost bin in your kitchen for easy disposal of scraps.
- Mix your compost with garden soil to enrich it naturally.
 
### Be Creative with Cooking

Get inventive with your cooking. Sometimes, your favorite meals can be made with what you have on hand. If you have wilting vegetables, why not toss them into a smoothie? Here are some ideas:

- Make a veggie stir-fry with whatever produce is nearing its end.
- Prepare blending sauces or dressings using nuts and leftover herbs.
- Experiment with smoothies that incorporate fruits and greens that are starting to turn.
 
### Freeze Surplus Food

When you know you won’t consume certain items before they spoil, freeze them! Freezing most fruits, vegetables, and even prepared meals is a great way to extend their life. Use freezer-safe containers and mark them with dates to keep track of what you have stored.

### Educate Yourself and Others

Share the knowledge of reducing food waste with others in your community. Organize workshops or join local groups focused on sustainable living. Helping others understand the importance of food waste reduction creates a ripple effect that benefits everyone.

By adopting these simple yet effective strategies, you can greatly contribute to reducing food waste while enjoying a plant-based lifestyle. Every small action counts, and together, we can make a significant impact on the environment.

</div>The Environmental Impact of Food Waste and How a Vegan Diet Can Help
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Every year, a staggering amount of food is wasted globally. In fact, approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption ends up in the trash. This waste has profound environmental impacts, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and the depletion of natural resources. If you're looking for positive change, adopting a vegan diet can be a powerful way to reduce food waste while promoting sustainability.

### Understanding the Environmental Costs of Food Waste

Food waste contributes significantly to climate change. When food rots in landfills, it produces methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide. As the climate crisis intensifies, the need for sustainable living practices is more important than ever. Not only does the waste of food waste resources, but it also leads to unnecessary environmental destruction, including habitat loss and soil degradation.

### The Role of a Vegan Diet

By choosing a vegan diet, you engage in a lifestyle that is often more sustainable than omnivorous diets. The production of plant-based foods typically requires less land, water, and energy compared to raising livestock. Therefore, by embracing veganism, you inherently support efforts to reduce food waste and its environmental impact.

### 10 Simple Ways To Reduce Food Waste as a Vegan

- **Plan Your Meals:** Start each week by planning your meals. Having a clear idea of what you’ll cook can help prevent overbuying groceries.
- **Shop Smart:** Create a grocery list before heading to the store. Stick to the list to avoid impulse buys that you might not use.
- **Understand Expiration Dates:** Many people confuse ""sell by,"" ""use by,"" and ""best before"" dates. Familiarize yourself with these terms to better assess food safety.
- **Store Food Properly:** Learn how to store fruits and vegetables correctly to extend their freshness. For example, keep apples in a cool place, away from other fruits to prevent them from ripening too quickly.
- **Use Leftover Ingredients:** Get creative with your leftovers. Blend overripe fruits into smoothies or use wilting vegetables in soups. This way, you’ll maximize the use of your food.
- **Grow Your Own:** Cultivating your own herbs, vegetables, or fruits can drastically cut down on food waste. When you harvest, you only take what you need.
- **Compost:** If you do have food scraps, composting them can help enrich the soil. Instead of wasting these items, they can help create nutrient-rich compost for your garden.
- **Share with Friends:** If you have excess food, share it with friends or neighbors. A potluck encourages community, and everyone gets to try different dishes.
- **Preserve Food:** Learn to can, freeze, or ferment your food. This not only reduces waste but also allows you to enjoy seasonal produce year-round.
- **Educate Yourself:** Stay informed about the issues surrounding food waste and animal agriculture. The more you know, the more proactive you can be in minimizing waste.

### Benefits of Going Vegan

Switching to a vegan lifestyle contributes to reducing the carbon footprint associated with food production. A diet that emphasizes plant-based ingredients generally consumes fewer resources and generates less waste. Furthermore, by adopting more sustainable food choices, you promote a healthier planet and support animal welfare.

### Community Impact

Many vegan communities focus on food sharing and minimizing waste. By participating in local food swap events or community gardens, you can reduce food waste while making connections with others who prioritize sustainability. These collaborations encourage a culture of valuing food, reducing waste, and sharing resources.

Ultimately, understanding the environmental impact of food waste and making informed choices as a vegan empowers you to contribute solutions. By intentionally reducing waste, you not only improve your lifestyle but also foster a healthier planet for future generations.

### Conclusion

Reducing food waste is not just a personal choice; it’s an essential step toward a more sustainable planet. By adopting practical strategies like meal planning, using leftovers creatively, and properly storing produce, you can significantly lessen your food waste footprint as a vegan. Each action you take contributes to a larger movement toward environmental responsibility and conservation.

The environmental impact of food waste is staggering, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of natural resources. Choosing a vegan diet can significantly mitigate these issues, as plant-based foods generally require fewer resources to produce than animal products. This means that when you reduce food waste, you are not only conserving resources but also enhancing the positive impact of your vegan lifestyle.

As you integrate these strategies into your daily routine, you’ll discover that every small change can lead to meaningful results. It's about making conscious choices that reflect your values, and every effort counts. By focusing on sustainability and being mindful of what you eat, you set a powerful example not just for yourself, but for your community as well.

Together, let’s work towards minimizing food waste, supporting a healthier planet, and demonstrating the efficacy of a vegan diet in creating a more sustainable future. Each step you take is a step toward a cleaner, greener world. So, embrace these simple tactics, and enjoy the satisfaction that comes from nurturing both your well-being and the health of the Earth.

Nmom (69) basically raised me (28f) all my life. Growing up, I never really understood why she was always looking for a way to hit me. I only found out about “narcissistic parents” lately.

I’m not really sure if these scenarios are actions of a NP or not, because she always told me that it’s what parents do.

1. When I started high school, I wanted to go out with my new friends/classmates and she immediately says no because my friend were “no good” and just a “bad influence” (I tried to introduce my friends to her but she said she didn’t care who they were)

2. When I was in college, we had to do distance education because of COVID. I had an ongoing class and she wanted me to buy her cigarettes (she wasn’t able to go out because she’s a senior and I was the only one that could go out) and I told her I just have to finish my class. Mind you, it was my last class for the day and I only had 15 minutes left to finish. She started throwing things around and screamed at me calling me “useless” because I couldn’t do what she wanted me to do ASAP.

3. (This was also when I was in college) My class schedule back then was from 8:00 am to 8:30 pm due to my majors. I had to commute back home everyday. Nights were the worst time to commute (in my country) because everyone else was going home and there was less transportation at night. It was normal for me to get home at around 9:30pm whenever class ended at 8:30. Latest was 10pm because of the long lines for transportation. There was one time I got home around a quarter before 10. I had to walk home from the terminal and guess what? I came home to Nmom screaming at me because there was no food. She knew about my schedule and how hard it was to get home. She said that I was just going out with friends and that I didn’t care if she ate or not. (She’s not bedridden, just lazy.)

4. I got a job after college and our office was beside a restaurant where Nmom and her friends went to one day. Nmom has heart problems and that time she was having a hard time walking because she was tired. She suddenly opened the door to our office and she said she wanted to rest there. I told her I’ll accompany her back to the restaurant she came from since our air conditioning system was busted and it was hot in our office. She took it the wrong way and accused me of being ashamed of her. I again told her about the air conditioning system and she wasn’t having it.

5. My friends (she met them and she likes them) were planning on going on a short road trip to try a coffee place and bbq place somewhere and asked me if I wanted to come. They also asked if Nmom wanted to come and she said nah because she didn’t like to go out. On the day of the trip, I told her I was heading out and she said “I thought I was invited” and I said yes then I told her we’d wait for her while she gets ready and she said never mind. While on the road, she texted me stuff like I was ungrateful and the worst daughter any mom could have. That she could see into my lies. (What lies???) I went back home with my room trashed. My clothes were all over the room. Thankfully she didn’t break my pc.

6. We had a company party where we could invite our family. I invited my partner and Nmom. I told them there was a small fee for food and they were okay with it. I also told them about the dress code, etc. Since I’m one of the organizers, I explained to Nmom that the party was outdoors and that we had to walk to the venue. I asked her if she was okay with that and she said yeah. The day before the party, she was acting up. She was telling me that I was ashamed of her because she was old. She began screaming at me again that I was a manipulative bitch and that she wishes she never gave birth to me and that I was a liar.

I have a lot more but this would do for now. I want to go NC but I still think I should take care of her. Retirement homes aren’t cheap from where I live so that’s not an option. I want to go to therapy but it’s something of a stigma in my country. I have siblings but they don’t want to care for her. I’m just mad that I’m the daughter that has to care for her but apparently I’m the useless one. Sometimes I wish she was dead but I don’t get my hopes up since “long life” is something that runs in our family.

1ijnxi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ijnxi4/buying_an_office_coffee_machine_1000/,Buying an office coffee machine [>1000$],"Hello everyone!

I'm an avid espresso drinker with strong opinions and since I've been complaning about our office coffee machine, I've been tasked to buy a new one. The budget is ""basically unlimited"" but realiscally under 2000$. Let me give you some context: 

\-The machine will be used 20-30 times everyday

\-Some users like espresso style coffe while some others and pull 1 big mug worth of coffee from a single nespresso capsule

\- Our water is medium-soft

\-We currntly have a delonghi magnifica s and use a local dark roast

The big boss is proposing some manual coffee machine, but honestly people are lazy enough not to fill back the water tank of the current machine and I believe that the coffee setup is going to be a mess in no time. 

Maybe the most reasonable choice is a nespresso pod machine, but I was also pondering proposing a ese pod compatible coffee machine that could theoretically do coffee powder. Something like the Delognhi dedica Style or a Breville barista.

  
Is there any other option that I'm not seeing? let me know and thanks in advance!

Through his passing, I became close with a couple, John and Jane, who were his best friends. We met at the funeral, and over time, they became like family. I visited them regularly, often for work, and they welcomed me into their home like I'd known them for years. I come from a large, loud Hispanic family with few boundaries, so I'm used to being affectionate and open.

During one of my visits, John mentioned his back pain at work, and since I used to teach yoga, I showed him a couple of stretches that helped me. I demonstrated one stretch on the floor, and when he tried it, his pocket ripped. We laughed, and I showed him another stretch, pushing his back to help him stretch further. There was nothing inappropriate about it, just a friendly exchange. I didn’t think anything of it since my late husband often had me show stretches to others, including male friends and family.

Later, Jane joked about John’s ripped pocket, and I laughed along, thinking nothing was wrong. However, after that visit, I noticed Jane became distant, not responding to my messages. Months later, Jane called me and said she needed to clear the air before I moved to their area for work. She explained that she didn’t like the way I had stretched John out and felt betrayed, even leading to a fight that almost caused their divorce. I apologized sincerely, not realizing I had crossed any boundaries, and promised to make amends.

Over the next few months, I continued to try and reach out to them, inviting them to get together, but my efforts were met with indifference. Meanwhile, they maintained a relationship with my late husband's parents, posting about missing him but not reaching out to me or my child despite my attempts.

When my office announced a Super Bowl party at John’s house, I messaged both of them to check if Jane would be comfortable since we hadn’t seen each other since I moved. Instead of a direct answer, I was invited to coffee the day before. I'm torn between being empathetic, understanding that I might have hurt Jane’s feelings, and feeling emotionally drained from repeatedly apologizing and trying to mend the relationship without much effort from their side.

I’m now frustrated that Jane can post on social media about missing my late husband while refusing to accept my apology or make any effort to reconnect with me or my son. I agreed to meet for coffee, but I’m starting to feel more upset than understanding. Am I in the wrong here? AITA?",6,1738906607.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

I have cats so I vacuum frequently ( once a day in the cat area) every couple days everywhere else even though I have a robot vacuum. In any event I met a girl a few months and we have been dating for about 5 months now. I love everything about her except she is not clean. She thinks she is “clean” but she isn’t. When I first went to her house it wasn’t bad like dishes left out or anything like that. It was more unorganization and not what I would consider clean. The glass table had streaks, looks like it never saw Windex under the baseboards was dusty, top of baseboards were dusty, dust webs in and around windowsills, fan completely covered in dust ( like it was never even touched) drops of something food , drink or coffee on the cabinets. I don’t ask her to clean but she can see the face I make when I come over and items are still on the table where they were 3 days ago when I was last there. She says you’re a clean freak and when you see something you just feel the need to clean it and it’s all you can do in that moment. She says it’s like OCD. I said it might be but I’m not willing to compromise on this. I said I don’t mind being the one to clean all the time but I don’t want to be made to feel bad for wanting to do. I said once it’s clean then it’s just a matter of keeping on top of it. I said how have you never noticed these things and she said I don’t see the same things you see! That statement is mind blowing to me, you don’t see cobwebs or dust bunnies and think wow I should clean that. Like wtf?! She said I’m willing to change and make more of an outfit but she wants me to back off a little and not give up quality time with her in order to clean. So we finally agreed to get a bunch of cleaning supplies on Amazon and her response tonight was it doesn’t make sense to me and never will why you feel the need to overhaul my house to get it to your liking but if that is what makes you happy and it will avoid more arguments in the future then so be it. She said I will try to be more clean but I can guarantee I’ll never be like you because for me it’s just not as important. She said I value time with my family and friends over cleaning. She said sure I’ll do it at some point but it’s not a priority for me. At this point I don’t even care if I have to do all the cleaning for the rest of our lives I just want her to stop making me feel bad for wanting to clean and live in what I consider a clean house ( clean to my standards) and just let me be. She wants me to move in with her but obviously as I’m sure you can tell it’s hard for me to stay in a house that isn’t clean up to my standards. I like to come home and sit back and look and be like ahh nice and clean. There is something about it for me. It’s ok if she isn’t like that but I am and I just feel like instead of making silly comments or tell me it’s bizarre how clean I am or the things I want to clean just let me do it and stop talking about it.

So, you've embarked on your epic quest to master the guitar and you keep hearing about this mysterious 'pedalboard.' Fear not, because I’m here to break it down for you! 

A pedalboard is simply a fancy board that holds your effect pedals—those magical little boxes that enhance your guitar sound (think reverb, delay, distortion, etc.). Basically, it’s like a coffee table for your guitar’s effects, keeping everything organized and ready to rock! ☕️🎸

### 🚀 Size Matters!
When considering a pedalboard, size does matter! Remember to account for:
1. **Effect Pedals**: Know how many you need and their sizes. Some are big, some are mini—choose wisely! 
2. **Space Between Pedals**: You’ll need around 2 inches for cables (gotta keep those connections clean!). 
3. **Power Supply**: Don’t forget this guy! It can take up space too. 

Get this right, and you’ll have a pedalboard that even your cat will admire! (Okay, maybe not, but you get the point). 🐱

### 🧩 Organizing Like a Pro
Now, how to organize your pedalboard: Start with pedals affecting **dynamics and pitch**, then **tone producers**, followed by **tone modifiers**, and finally the **ambiance creators** like reverb at the end. Your pedals will be thanking you, and your sound will be on point! 🎤💫 

### 🏆 What’s the Best Pedalboard?
Forget the one-size-fits-all approach; it doesn’t exist. Start with a mid-sized one and upgrade as your pedal addiction grows! If you’re feeling adventurous, DIY it! ✨ 

And there you have it! Know your pedals, give them a cozy home, and watch your guitar skills skyrocket! 🚀🎵 

Happy jamming, and may your effects be ever in your favor! 🎸😄

Later on, we became closer that we started having personal conversations, basically we’re like getting to know each other na and most of the time sabay din kami umuwi since we both live near each other lang. Tbh I find her cute, the way she giggles, the way she carry herself and her very clear skin attracts me talaga. May mga times sinasama ko na siya sa friend group ko sa office until naging close na din siya sa iba. Mixed signals appeared when she treats me differently compared to other people.

She would sometimes message me on gchat if i want to have meryenda with her or coffee. Yesterday, during lunch she messaged me if I want to have lunch with her daw and as her friend, I agreed to it ofcourse. During lunch we ate like normal friends do. 

Here’s girl B, she has been one of my office bestie for a quite some time. Before we became friends, we work together but we were barely talking as we both have this image na mataray/suplado siguro kaya din kami nag click cos of our similarities. She is the office crushie of most men in our company, she has average height, fit, huge ass (as she has been working out for it) and mestiza.

I didn't plan for it to happen, but I'm not complaining either. The thing is, I haven't been on a date in years. She's 17, I'm 18.

Some additional context on the two of us is that we've been friends online for years, and even tried out online dating in the past. But this is the first time seeing either of us in person for YEARS (we've seen photos, though).

I know it's supposed to be a romantic thing, I mean it's a date. Our plan is to go from coffee shop to coffee shop, and maybe we'll improvise some more as we go. It depends on how much time we have.

What do you do for valentines day? I'm trying to think of how to he affectionate and stuff, but truthfully, I don't know how to kiss. I'll try holding hands and stuff. It depends what she wants, but I already know she's down for that.

Should I try getting her some flowers? I mean, I think the gesture would be nice but I don't know. Would a bouquet be too much, or is there a way I can just get one? Would one seem cheap? We didn't bring up gifts or anything to one another either, but I don't really want to show up empty handed.

Any advice?",1,1738905466.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Probably not, right? Well unfortunately on may 30th of 1990, one Jon Arbuckle made that very mistake. You see, Jon had just taken his cat Garfield to the vet for his annual checkup. By the way, have you ever actually stopped to THINK about how TERRIBLE a name like fucking GARFIELD is for a cat? Like, that cat's gotta have some trauma, and it isn't just from the dog semen incident, I'll tell ya that. Anywho, as Jon returned from a trip to the bathroom, he saw a styrofoam cup on the counter and, doing as any sane man would do, assumed it was coffee. What he did next, however, was anything BUT sane. HE DRANK IT. HE. DRANK. IT. Now, you're probably thinking, ""well, that's certainly unusual! why on earth would he drink what was most likely someone else's coffee without asking first?"" Well oh boy, lemme tell ya... it was dog semen. It was literally not coffee, but dog semen. Now, the governor of Jon's jurisdiction, a man named Jim Davis, would lead you to believe this story is bogus, and that it was actually a PROTEIN SUPPLEMENT meant for pregnant dogs. But here's the thing: the ONLY veterinary office that operates in that jurisdiction DOES NOT CARRY ANY SUCH SUPPLEMENT, And they NEVER HAVE. (1/23)",1,1738905315.0,copypasta,1,1.0,False

1ijnhee,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1ijnhee/my_boyfriend_of_one_year_gave_me_a_fistbump_in/,My boyfriend of one year gave me a fistbump in front of his friend because he doesn't want anyone to know about us and got angry when I said it offended me,"Throwaway. We've been together almost a year. He's never taken me on a date. He's only met two of my friends. We see eachother on the weekends - he sleeps over at my place. I have been feeling like his sex doll for a while, especially because he hasn't told anybody about me. Not even his brothers or friends. I asked him why not and he said he wants to protect what we have. I didn't press him for more. 

Fast forward to today. We spent last night together, and this morning too. We had to be at work. We're late. We rush out, running, and we run into a friend of his. Right in front of my place. He awkwardly introduces me by name, no ""my girlfriend"". I actually know this person. So we get to chatting on our commute. When we have to go our separate ways (I and the friend need to stay, boyfriend has to go a different way), they shake hands and say goodbye. Boyfriend then turns to me, and gives me a fist bump. 

Like an actual bro fist bump. 

I chuckled awkwardly, bumping him back. I noticed walking he kept trying to distance himself from me, so far as making me walk next to the friend (as in, the friend was in the middle of us!). He also ignored me when I talked to him. He was acting very weird, but the fist bump was the final straw for me. I tried not to think about it, but I couldn't. We'd just spent last night and a couple of hours in the morning having sex and he gave me a fist bump? 

So I texted him to tell him that made me feel bad, and he shouldn't do it again. I told him I don't want to be his buddy, I'm his girlfriend. He shouldn't treat me like a buddy. I didn't ask for a kiss or a hug, not even a hand shake. Just don't fist bump me. Because, he doesn't act like a boyfriend so it makes me think I'm just a play thing when he treats me like this. He said he didn't even think about it - this is just something he does, and that I was overthinking and overreacting. He said he was offended that I even suggested that he's only with me for sex. 

Yet, every time we see eachother, we have sex. We have never just gone to the movies. He blames me for ignoring him because I say I can't hangout at home (roommate has people over, etc) but he's never asked me to go out. I just said we can't hang out at my place. His place is available, I think? Restaurants and parks and coffee shops and the freaking mall are all available? How am I not supposed to think he is just using me for sex when he never wants to see me unless he's horny and wants a release? Sure, sex is part of a relationship, but if it's all there is in a relationship... 

I got shocked at this reaction, and I tried calling him. He didn't answer and said he needs time. I needed legit communication, so I asked him what was going through his mind. He said he's insulted because if it was sex he wanted, he could have gotten it anywhere. Then he said I went on his nerves and he loved our relationship when I didn't fight him for no reason. I asked him to go to the mall this weekend with me, and he brought this up saying you just asked me to do this and I said yes. I told him that was the bare minimum. He got even more angry, and said ""fine. I don't even want anything from this. Not even sex. We should never have sex again."" 

What is happening? Was I really so wrong to not want a fistbump after getting effed by a man who is my boyfriend? Is it just so bad that I want to not be his dirty secret? He said the reason he acted a bit off in front of his friend (confirming I wasn't crazy about him not even walking next to me) was because the friend knows where he lives and seeing him come out of my place with a girl, he felt outed somehow. 

He got so angry with me I started crying and apologizing, and he said he didn't want to hear that and he is very serious about not wanting anything. So I asked if it meant he was breaking up with me, and he got even angrier saying that if anyone breaks up with someone over a fistbump that they're basically an idiot and no, he wasn't breaking up with me but he wants nothing from me. Not even sex. 

So now I don't know what to do. I feel like he's punishing me, being cold, responded with one word answers to my walls of text (doesn't wanna see or speak on the phone). I think he's being very immature, and I'm honestly hurt and offended and feel gutted because I thought we were finally going somewhere. Am I the problem? Did I overreact? 

TLDR boyfriend (38M, 30F) doesn't want people to know about our relationship because he wants to protect us, so when we ran into his friend outside of my house bf started acting weird and cold with me, and gave me a fist bump for goodbye. I told him it made me feel bad because I'm not his buddy and he freaked out over this. ",1,1738905031.0,AskMenAdvice,11,0.67,False

My girlfriend moved in with me while we were both in school and I worked full time at a welding shop while in high school and since she has moved in with me I have been paying all of her bills for almost 3 years now and she has had plenty of good paying jobs, Wich she either gets fired because she doesn't want to go in or quits because it's to hard she says( most of these jobs only last about 3 weeks) so about 3 months ago her grandfather passed away so she went away to go see her grandmother( it's about a 15 hour drive to go there)
But since then she got roped into taking care of her for a couple weeks but weeks turned into months and now we're at about 5 months without seeing each other.since she has been gone her mother who lives down there has been doing nothing but saying bad things about me , like if he loved you he would move down here and you shouldn't have to work if your with a man who loves you and etc 
Where her grandmother lives she has about 12 family members who can take care of her but they just think it's my girlfriend's job to it and my girlfriend doesn't see a issue with it. And for the last couple of months I have been in school and told her I can't pay your bills for a bit and all she said to me over the phone was that's good for you in a bitter voice and hung up and she didn't talk to me for 3 days. But eventually I had to pay it and put my self in debt . She has been so bitter with me every time we talk on the phone for no reason and I just feel my mental and physical health deteriorationing every day. I understand she has to be there for her grandmother but she won't even stick up for me to her mom and it gets put on me because she starts to believe the things her mom says about me. 
I love her but I just feel like it's pulling me down. In every way to be with her

EDIT
thank you all for the advice I think tomorrow I'm going to meet her dad for coffee and explain things ( he has always supported me and even said his daughter wasn't being a good partner) I love her but I think it's time to let go

We were both big drinkers when we met. We’re also in an LDR so we only see each other on weekends, so pretty much every day we’ve spent together has involved a lot of drinking. Our usual routine was go for brunch, get drinks, then head out to a few different breweries or barcades, then go to a show and drink a bunch more there, then grab more booze on the way home and drink till we both pass out. Then sleep off the hangover the next day.

It makes me cringe just to think about it. I feel like we’ve barely spent any sober time together. He doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic but he’s been supportive of my quitting drinking and says he won’t drink this weekend when he comes to visit.

We’re going to go for some walks, hit up some coffee shops, go see a wrestling show. But now that we’re not just hanging out in bars all day, I feel like we have so much time to fill and I have no idea what else to do.

How do you fill the time you used to spend drinking with your partner?",4,1738904615.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False
1ijnc1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1ijnc1u/11_days_in_mexico_city_with_23l_fanny_pack/,11 days in Mexico City with 23L (+ fanny pack),"Just got back from an awesome solo trip to CDMX, where I traveled with one backpack + fanny pack for 11 days and 10 nights at an AirBnB. I repacked my bag and took some pics (in a comment below) to do a trip report for y'all - I'll paste in my packing list by chunks below (which roughly match up with the pics) and add commentary to some of the items based on my trip experience. Let me know if you have any questions or comments!



**Main gear + worn clothes:** I wore my bulkiest items like jeans and my hoodie on the plane which is definitely the only way I was able to bring enough clothes. My full packed loadout was about 20lbs, and the Vagabond Jet was comfy even though that was probably the most I'd try to carry with it. 



In the future, I might not bring a metal water bottle to Mexico since you typically drink bottled water anyway. 

* **Backpack:** Gossamer Gear Vagabond Jet
* **Fanny Pack:** Gossamer Gear Bumster Jet
   * AirPods pro
   * Kindle
   * Sunglasses
   * Lip balm
   * Lactojoy
   * Space pen
   * Notebook
   * Passport
   * Brewzer
* **Water bottle:** Hydroflask Trail 24oz
* **Worn Items:**
   * Phone
   * New Balances
   * Belt
   * Jeans
   * Western Rise merino long sleeve
   * Patagonia R1 Air hoodie
   * Compression socks
   * Underwear
   * Wallet
   * Glasses
   * G-Shock



**Packed clothes: I** think this was the most clothing I could feasibly fit in my pack. It would've been nice to have an extra pair of underwear and socks to reduce the number of times I had to do laundry, but it wasn't too big of a problem. The dry bag was perfect as a laundry bag to which I could just add soap and water to do laundry. I had my bases covered for clothing needs e.g., jeans + the button-up were good enough for nice bars/restaurants, and the capilene hoodie was perfect for a day in the sun at the pyramids of Teotihuacan.

  
In the future, I would leave the wind shell behind - it was never cold enough to need the extra layer, and an ultralight rain jacket or poncho would have been much more useful during the few rainstorms I experienced. I also don't really wear hats, so I don't know why I bothered to bring a hat

* **Small cube:**
   * Underwear x3
   * Merino socks x4
* M**edium cube:**
   * Lululemon button-up
   * Capilene hoodie
   * Proof tee
   * Lululemon tee
   * Lululemon shorts
   * Western Rise Evolution pants
* **Other:**
   * Bedrock sandals
   * Cheap bucket hat
   * Sea to Summit dry bag
   * Cotopaxi Teca wind shell

  
**Electronics + Camera:** I tried to pack minimally since my camera + lens is already heavier than I wish it was, so simply wrapped my travel towel around it for a little protection. 

  
In the future, I'd leave the extra camera battery behind - one battery lasted all day every day, and the X-T4 can recharge over USB if I really need to top up. I'd probably also prefer a smaller power back that is easier to carry in my fanny pack

* **Camera stuff:**
   * Fuji X-T4 w/ battery and SD card
   * Sigma 16-50mm f2.8
   * Wrist strap
   * Shoulder strap
   * Extra battery
   * Travel towel wrapped around camera
*  **Other electronics** **/ tech pouch:**
   * iPad + pencil
   * In backpack external zipper pocket:
      * 20k battery bank
      * Zebralight flashlight
      * Extra camera battery
      * C-C cable (short)
   * Tech pouch:
      * Emergency titanium spork
      * USB C drive
      * C-C cable (long)
      * Charging brick



**Toiletries / First Aid:** I was paranoid about getting food poisoning, which is why I added Imodium, Travelan, and Trioral electrolyte to my off-the-shelf FAK - I didn't get sick or shit myself, so I think they were worthy additions. The Trioral was great for hydrating in the first couple days as I adjusted to the altitude, but I would not bring as many packs next time.

  
I didn't use the masks or hand sanitizer (always better to wash your hands), but I don't regret bringing them in case I was stuck next to somebody sick on the plane, or the bad air quality in CDMX got to me.

*  **Sea to Summit toiletry bag:**

   * Electrolytes
   * Imodium
   * Travelan
* **Other:**
   * KN95 masks
   * Dr. Bronner's hand sanitizer

  
**Miscellaneous:** I debated bringing the daypack since it's not much smaller than my backpack, but it was helpful for longer day trips, and I ended up needing it on the way back to carry the several pounds of coffee I brought back with me

* **Daypack:** Gossamer Gear Minimalist 19

   * Sea to Summit eye mask

1ijnbpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1ijnbpe/advice_longterm_friendship_changing_after_marriage/,Advice: long-term friendship changing after marriage,"Hi everyone,

My close friend of more than ten years got married three years ago and since then her husband is always coming to our catch-ups. For context, we’re so close that I was Maid of Honour in their wedding. 

We only hang out every other month or so as we don’t live very close to one another. Thankfully it only started when they got married as they had not lived together before then and far from each other.

She only hangs out with me if he goes to exercise etc and she’s alone for a few hours with seemingly no one else to hang out with.

It’s starting to feel like I’m a third wheel at these catch-ups and like I’m intruding on their time together, with little in-joke moments etc. This is despite her mostly asking me to hang out.

Naturally the conversations are much more censored or surface level than they once were as he’s always there.

There’s also been moments where her husband seems to stare into the distance awkwardly and she has emotionally checked him asking if he’s okay etc.

It’s like she brings him because:

a). They want to spend ALL of their weekend together 

b). He’s there as a buffer as she no longer wants to spend 1:1 time with me, and she honestly only asks me out to keep the friendship going somewhat or feels sorry for me

c). He has no friends of his own

I believe if I raise my feelings she’ll just distance herself. I feel my best option is to do a slow fade when she asks to hang out so as to not cause any issues. Maybe catch up every six months?

I am cognisant that being single makes me probably more vulnerable to feeling like a third wheel so I’m likely contributing to the issue.

I think it just bothers me deeply that she just decided to start bringing him everywhere and disregarded my input - like I’m lucky to have time with her whatever which way. I feel rejected, even if this doesn’t make sense - like my company isn’t enough. 

There was also a moment at our last catch-up where we discussed overseas trip plans for the year, and she basically said they would be happy ‘to catch up for coffee etc’ at a point if there’s crossovers. This is so surface level to me, especially as we had always spoken about one day travelling together. 

I’ve written this mostly just to vent and mourn my friendship. It’s very sad too as I know it will only get worse once they have children.

The Benefits of Micro-Investing Apps for Building Wealth
--------------------------------------------------------

In today's fast-paced financial world, micro-investing apps have transformed the way people approach saving and investing. With the ability to make small investments without significant risk, these platforms allow you to build wealth over time, even if you start with just a few dollars. Let's explore the advantages of using these apps and why they can be a game-changer for your financial journey.

### Accessibility and Ease of Use

One of the standout features of micro-investing apps is their accessibility. You don’t need to be a financial expert or have large sums of money to start investing. With a smartphone and internet access, you can open an account in minutes. Apps like Acorns, Stash, and Robinhood provide user-friendly interfaces that guide you through the investment process step by step. This ease of use encourages more people to get started, breaking down barriers that once existed.

### Automated Investments

Micro-investing apps often come with automated investment features that take the guesswork out of saving. For example, many platforms allow you to set up round-ups, where your purchases are rounded up to the nearest dollar, and the spare change is invested. This means you can begin to grow your wealth without having to think about it actively. Regular contributions, no matter how small, can accumulate over time.

### Diversification Made Simple

Investing typically involves risk, especially when putting all your eggs in one basket. Micro-investing apps tackle this issue by allowing users to invest in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) or diversified portfolios. Here are some benefits of diversification:

- **Reduced Risk:** By spreading your investments across different assets, you minimize the impact of a single investment performing poorly.
- **Greater Potential Returns:** Diversifying helps you capture gains from various sectors, maximizing your potential returns.
- **Access to Different Markets:** You can invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, even with limited funds.

Many apps curate these portfolios for you, making it simple to launch your investment journey.

### Educational Resources

Micro-investing apps don’t just focus on transactions; they often offer educational resources aimed at improving your financial literacy. By learning the basics of investing, you empower yourself to make informed decisions. Some apps provide articles, videos, and tutorials that explain different investment strategies, risk management, and market trends. This education can be invaluable as you grow your wealth.

### Low Fees and Investment Minimums

Traditional investment platforms may require hefty minimum deposits and charge high management fees. In contrast, micro-investing apps typically have no account minimums and charge lower fees. This makes them a more practical option for beginners looking to dip their toes into investing. You can start investing with as little as $5 or even less, which makes it easier to get started without feeling overwhelmed by costs.

### Customized Investment Plans

Many micro-investing apps allow users to tailor their investment plans according to personal goals and risk tolerance. You can select the type of investments that align with your financial ambitions, whether it’s aggressive growth, conservative income, or a balanced approach. This customizability ensures that your investment strategy is as unique as you are.

### Encouraging Savings Habits

Using micro-investing apps can also foster good financial habits. When you make investing a regular part of your financial routine, it becomes easier to prioritize saving. Over time, you’ll develop a mindset that recognizes the value of long-term wealth accumulation. This change in perspective can help you make more financially sound decisions in other areas of your life.

### Tracking Progress

Monitoring your investments is crucial to success. Micro-investing apps typically offer robust tracking features, allowing you to see how your investments are performing in real time. This visibility helps you stay informed and engaged with your financial journey, ultimately guiding your decisions as you build wealth.

In a world where financial stability is essential, micro-investing apps present a practical and accessible way to start your investment journey. By embracing small, consistent investments and taking advantage of the resources these platforms offer, you can pave the way toward long-term financial success. Whether you're new to investing or looking for ways to grow your existing portfolio, these apps make it easier than ever to take charge of your financial future.

How Micro-Investing Works: A Simple Guide
-----------------------------------------

Are you curious about how to grow your wealth without needing to invest a large amount of money upfront? Micro-investing apps might just be what you’re looking for! These innovative tools let you start investing with small amounts of money—sometimes even spare change. Understanding how micro-investing works can open up new opportunities for building your financial future, so let’s dive into the details.

Micro-investing allows you to invest smaller amounts than traditional methods. This means you don't need thousands of dollars to start. Here’s how it generally works:

- **Round-Up Investments:** Some micro-investing apps let you link your bank account or credit card. Every time you make a purchase, the app rounds up the total to the nearest dollar and invests the difference. For example, if you buy a coffee for $2.75, the app will round it up to $3 and invest the extra 25 cents.
- **Weekly or Monthly Contributions:** Aside from round-ups, you can set up automatic contributions to your investment account. You choose a small amount that you are comfortable with and set it to autosave weekly or monthly.
- **Customized Portfolios:** Many apps offer personalized investment portfolios based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. You can prioritize stocks, bonds, or a mix, allowing you to tailor your investments.
- **Educational Resources:** Most micro-investing platforms provide valuable resources to help you learn about investing. They often include articles, tutorials, and webinars to guide you through the investing world.

Tips for Maximizing Returns with Micro-Investing
------------------------------------------------

Micro-investing has made investing accessible to everyone, regardless of how much money you have. With just a few dollars, you can start building your wealth with micro-investing apps. However, to truly maximize your returns with these small investments, it's important to keep a few key tips in mind.

### Understand Your Investment Options

Micro-investing apps often provide various investment options, from ETFs to fractional shares of stocks. Taking the time to understand what each option does can help you make better choices. Here are some popular choices:

- **ETFs:** These can offer diversity in your investments, spreading your risk across multiple assets.
- **Fractional Shares:** If you want to invest in a pricey stock, fractional shares allow you to own a portion instead.
- **Robo-Advisors:** Some apps provide automated portfolio management, making investment easier for beginners.

### Consistent Contributions Matter

One of the best ways to boost your returns is by making regular contributions to your micro-investing account. Whether it's weekly or monthly, you should aim to invest a set amount consistently. This strategy, known as dollar-cost averaging, allows you to buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high. Over time, this can reduce your investment's average cost per share, leading to higher potential returns.

### Set Clear Goals

Before you start investing, take some time to set clear financial goals. Ask yourself what you want to achieve with your micro-investments. Are you saving for a vacation, a new car, or even retirement? Having specific goals will help you stay focused and encourage disciplined investing. When you understand the purpose of your investments, you're more likely to stick with your plan during market fluctuations.

### Diversify Your Portfolio

Diversification is crucial when it comes to investing. By spreading your money across various assets, you reduce the risk of losing money if one investment performs poorly. Here are some ways to diversify your micro-investing portfolio:

- Invest in different sectors, such as technology, healthcare, and consumer goods.
- Consider including international investments to hedge against domestic market dips.
- Mix stocks, bonds, and other asset types for a balanced portfolio.

### Utilize Investment Learning Resources

Many micro-investing apps offer educational resources designed to help investors understand the market better. Invest time in learning the basics of investing through articles, videos, and podcasts provided by the app, as well as other reputable sources. The more you know, the better your investment decisions will be.

### Monitor Performance Regularly

It’s essential to keep an eye on how your investments are performing. Micro-investing apps often provide tools to help track your portfolio. Make it a routine to check your progress in relation to your goals. This will help you make necessary adjustments and will also keep you informed about market trends. Don’t be afraid to rebalance your portfolio if you notice one area is holding you back.

### Be Patient and Stay Committed

Investing is not a ""get rich quick"" scheme. Instead, it’s a long-term strategy that requires patience. You may not see immediate results, but staying committed to your investment plan will pay off in the long run. Remember, the market can be volatile, and it’s common for prices to fluctuate. Resist the urge to sell during a downturn. Instead, focus on your long-term goals and trust in your investment strategy.

### Leverage Compounding Interest

One of the most powerful tools in investing is the magic of compounding. When your investments generate earnings, those earnings can themselves earn returns. By consistently adding to your investment and allowing it to grow over time, you’ll benefit from this compounded growth. Even small contributions can lead to significant wealth accumulation, particularly over many years.

Micro-investing apps are a fantastic opportunity for anyone looking to dip their toes into the investment waters. By following these tips, you can maximize your returns and grow your wealth, even with small investments. Start today, stay disciplined, and watch your financial future evolve!

Overcoming Common Misconceptions About Small Investments
--------------------------------------------------------

Investing can feel daunting, and many people shy away from it due to common misunderstandings about small investments. These misconceptions can hold you back from reaping the financial rewards that even tiny investments can bring. Here, we’ll tackle these myths and reveal how you can grow your wealth without needing a fortune upfront.

### Myth 1: You Need a Lot of Money to Start Investing

Many individuals believe that investing is only for the wealthy. This couldn't be further from the truth! With the rise of micro-investing apps, you can start investing with as little as a few dollars. These platforms allow you to invest spare change and make it possible for anyone to begin building their portfolio. Whether you have $5 or $50, you can start creating a diverse investment strategy.

### Myth 2: Small Investments Don’t Make a Difference

It’s easy to think that small investments aren’t worth your time, but that’s a misconception. Here are several reasons why every dollar counts:

- **Compound Interest:** Even small amounts can grow significantly over time with the magic of compound interest. Investing early and consistently can lead to substantial returns.
- **Dollar-Cost Averaging:** Frequently investing smaller amounts may protect you against market volatility. You’ll be buying more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when they’re high.
- **Diversification:** Small investments can help you build a well-rounded portfolio. Investing in various assets reduces risks.

### Myth 3: Only Stocks Are Worth Investing In

Many people think that stocks are the only profitable investment option. While stocks can yield high returns, they’re not the only game in town. Small investments can also be made in:

- **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):** These funds are collections of stocks that you can invest in as a single asset. They allow you to diversify your investment for a lower cost.
- **Robo-Advisors:** Many robo-advisors require only a small amount to start managing your investments. They use algorithms to create a personalized portfolio based on your goals.
- **Real Estate Crowdfunding:** You can now invest in real estate with relatively little capital through crowdfunding platforms, enabling you to grow wealth in alternative ways.

### Myth 4: Investing is Too Complicated

Some individuals feel overwhelmed by the thought of investing and assume that they need extensive knowledge to participate. However, many micro-investing apps are designed to be user-friendly. They simplify the process by allowing you to:

- **Automate Investments:** You can set up automated transfers from your bank account, so you won’t need to worry about actively managing your investments.
- **Access Learning Tools:** Most apps offer resources to help you understand investment basics, making it easier to become informed and confident.
- **Check Growth Easily:** The platforms allow you to monitor your investments in real-time, offering insights into your portfolio's performance.

### Myth 5: It’s Too Late to Start Investing

Many people feel regretful about not investing sooner, but it’s never too late to start. The earlier you invest, the better the rewards due to compounded growth. However, if you’re starting later in life, small investments can still help you pave your way to financial security. Whether you want to save for retirement, a big purchase, or just build your wealth, beginning your investment journey today is essential.

These common misconceptions about small investments can prevent you from achieving your financial goals. Micro-investing apps make it simple to start investing with any budget. By understanding that even small investments can lead to growth and diversification, you can cultivate a lucrative portfolio over time. So, embrace the opportunity to invest, no matter how small, and watch your wealth flourish!

### Conclusion

Micro-investing apps offer a practical and accessible way for anyone to start building their wealth, regardless of their financial background. By breaking down barriers to investment, these platforms make it easier for you to grow your savings, one small step at a time. Understanding how micro-investing works is crucial; it involves making tiny, regular investments that accumulate over time, allowing your money to grow even without significant upfront capital.

When considering which micro-investing apps to use, it’s essential to evaluate your personal goals and preferences. Popular apps come equipped with user-friendly interfaces and helpful features designed to streamline your investment journey. Remember, every small contribution counts and can lead to greater returns when strategically managed.

To maximize your investment returns, consider setting up automatic contributions to ensure consistent growth. Additionally, educating yourself about market trends and diversification can help you make informed choices. Dispelling common misconceptions about micro-investing can also empower you to take that first step. Many people believe that investing requires large sums of money or extensive financial knowledge; however, micro-investing proves that starting small is not only possible but also effective.

Ultimately, micro-investing apps are a fantastic opportunity for building wealth gradually. By using the right tools, staying informed, and maintaining a disciplined approach, you can turn tiny investments into significant financial gains over time. Start your micro-investing journey today, and watch as your wealth grows—one small investment at a time.

1ijna1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1ijna1c/wondering_how_many_people_have_lost_their_meds/,Wondering how many people have lost their meds,"I know a few people who have lost access to their hrt prescriptions and I want to know how widespread this is. As an egg, I'm not doing hrt so I don't know. I know the government is trying to shut trans access down completely and I need to know if it's happening to everyone.

I'm worried about someone. They have made it clear they don't want to talk to me, so I can't even ask if they're okay.  
I found a way to reliably get hrt for them two weeks ago.  I have had two vials of t sitting in my desk for a week. I will get two vials a month indefinitely. I'm an idiot for doing this.

I'm afraid to initiate contact because they hate me and ruined my reputation because they wanted me out of their space that badly.  I didn't even try to share my side because I didn't want to make them look bad.  It could damage their plans and quality of life if people knew what really happened. But I worry about him.

I wonder if they're okay every day. And I can't even ask though I see them in the corner of my eye drinking coffee at school.  And I don't know what he'd do if I just walked up to him one afternoon and put a small box with a vial hidden inside next to his coffee cup and left without a word.

I don't know if he'd accept help from me.  I think it might make everything worse for me if I try anything at all. He might even misinterpret it and use it as a reason to do more damage to me. I don't know.  99% of my issues with him stem from my inability to read minds and his disinterest in listening to me.  I'm convinced that if he talked too much about his feelings, someone would have to stab him with an epipen or he'd collapse and possibly suffocate.

But wondering if they've lost access to something so vital to who they are is killing me.  And I think if they lost their hrt, it might kill them. I don't think I could keep going if something happened to him.  Even if I know they're never going to talk to me again and don't want me in their life, I don't think I could live.

I don't want them to feel like they owe me something. Or placate me to get drugs. That sounds truly awful. And I think explaining that I would do anything for him would probably just exacerbate the situation, but I think about that every day.

I would risk it if I knew they didn't have meds. But only if I knew.  Because this is a terrible, terrible idea.  And it can only harm me.  Yet I don't care what happens to me if it means they're okay. Because I'm an idiot with anything concerning him. Doing this is a literal crime. And I would do it in a heartbeat if I knew he needed help.

So has everyone lost access to their meds? Is it to that point?",1,1738904336.0,trans,0,1.0,False

He has been with his current girlfriend (Renee) for about 5 years. I went through a pretty rough breakup last year with my ex girlfriend of 6 years. I struggled to pull myself together after the breakup. Me and Renees friendship grew together since the breakup. Renee and I would cook dinner together on my days off from work, occasionally go for coffee and watch movies at night until Harley came home from work which he works M-F about 2pm-12am. 

About 9 months after the breakup I decided to start dating again. Obviously besties talk about these things but I noticed her vibe changed when I told Renee about these girls I wanted to message. I noticed she was very critical of the first two girls saying it wouldn’t work out and they were scum. Which I was not expecting that from her. One day I decided to ask this cute girl (Reese) out for a movie date. It was the scariest most exciting thing I have felt in a while, the date went amazing. I was so excited to tell Renee. 

When I told her she immediately criticized her saying she’s not right for me and her anxiety is too much and I’m just going to hurt her. I confronted Renee because I don’t understand how I’m supposed to be happy putting myself out there again if you keep shutting everything down. We ended up growing farther apart as time went on and she began to ignore me every time we crossed paths which was very often. At one point I was annoyed because she refused to talk to me.
 
I decided to confront her and ask her why she was acting the way she was acting and she responded with “I just know where I stand”. Which I don’t exactly know why she said that because I still attempted to make plans with her and she would leave me on read. It got so uncomfortable to the point where me and my current partner Reese took the risk and moved in together after 3 months because the environment with my bestfriend and his girlfriend became the silent treatment. To this day, I still don’t understand where I went wrong. Me and Reese have been together for over a year and are now engaged. Am I the asshole for not trying hard enough to understand what happened?

We live in a remote area in the countryside, and I’ve been unemployed for a few months now after losing my job due to a bullying and harassment situation at work. I’d found a better-paying role, but it ended horribly, and I’ve been trying to get back on my feet since.



I’ve been applying to 10 jobs a day consistently and even came close to landing a role last month but came second in interviews. In the meantime, I’ve been working on starting a graphic design business and took a course in floristry to explore other creative avenues. I am also trying to learn how to drive and bought a car with my inheritance money so I could potentially get a job in the town an hour away. I also pay for my own food, bills, and rent, though my boyfriend covers our dates petrol and coffees.



While he’s been supportive in some ways—like teaching me to drive and helping with petrol—he’s made me feel terrible about being unemployed. At one point, he told me I should “scrub toilets” to contribute, which hurt deeply. He often accuses me of freeloading and has made comments that make me feel like I’m not doing enough, even though I’m trying my hardest.



I’ve even considered moving to Sydney to find better job opportunities, but that would mean leaving him and starting over. I feel so torn because I love him, but his words have made me question my self-worth AND make me worried I am a narcissist.

Teacher and student father (M4a or m4f) only discord and Instagram 


I’m the father of my 7-year-old son/daughter—a brilliant but mischievous kid. Recently, I was called to the principal’s office because my child decided to rip up another student’s book. After a stern discussion with the principal, I was directed to visit the class teacher’s room for further guidance.

I knocked on her door, and a soft, sweet voice answered, “Yes, please, come in.” I stepped inside with my child, taking a seat at her desk. The moment I saw her, my attention shifted. She was wearing a traditional saree, draped elegantly, and her natural charm was impossible to ignore. Her warm smile and graceful demeanor made it difficult to focus on the reason I was there.

As she began discussing my child’s results and behavior, I found myself less interested in the report card and more captivated by her. It was as if the world slowed down. Then, almost unexpectedly, she looked at me and asked, “Would you like to meet for coffee?”

Her words caught me off guard, but I quickly replied, “Yes, please,” without hesitation.

What could she possibly want to discuss over coffee? Was it about my child—or something more? I couldn’t wait to find out.

Okay, so we hit up this small amusement park that’s now famous because of the K-drama ‘Lovely Runner’ (선재 업고 튀어).

It’s a bit pricey (around 30k \~ 40k won per person), but totally worth it! For something more budget-friendly, we had dwaeji-gukbap (돼지국밥), a comforting pork soup that’s perfect after a long day of exploring (about 10k won per person).



**Samsunsan Arboretum (삼성산 수목원)**

Whether you’re riding bumper cars like a kid, watching the sunrise, or just chilling by the sea, this place has a way of making you appreciate the little things.

Last year in November I had unprotected sex, didn't go all the way and neither of us finished. It was the last Friday in November, I'm pretty sure. Got my period 3 days after that, heavy 6 day red blood period. The next period was due February. It was 7 days late. I had stressed and lost weight(about 4 kilos and I'm already pretty skinny)because I broke up with the guy. Got my period, 6 days, heavy bleeding, strong cramping on the 1st day that caused me to even vomit. My curent period was supposed to arrive on the 6. Had spotting the day before and the start of the period was light brown which made me a bit concerned but it eventually became my usual bright red. Anyway, arrived 2 days early. A little less heavy and a bit more blood clots than usual, some even light brownish, which I don't think I ever experienced... 

Anyway, all under ""normal"" size from what I've read on websites. And there weren't really clots on the pad, only when I wiped I saw them on the toilet paper. I went to the toilet just now and there were a bit of ""coffee grounds"". Pretty sure that's the first time I'm seeing that so I'm confused. I searched it up and the first result that popped up was ""Possible miscarriage""
I'm doubting that's the case though, haven't experinced any pregnancy symptoms to begin with and this period I've had like 0 cramps.

Hi there! I’m Mike (29M) from Connecticut, and I’m looking to connect with someone who believes conversations can be little adventures. I’ve always loved learning from people’s unique stories—whether it’s swapping perspectives, geeking out over random trivia (thanks, museum deep-dives!), or laughing at life’s beautifully messy moments.

**A Few Things About Me:**

* **Curious & Open-Hearted:** I’m the guy who asks too many questions (blame my love for mysteries!) and finds joy in small moments—like my 5-year-old chihuahua’s antics or discovering a song that feels like it was written just for me.
* **Hobbies:** Walking in nature, experimenting with new recipes (let’s trade favorites!), exploring museums, and getting lost in dramas/mysteries (*All Creatures Great and Small* is my latest cozy read).
* **Life Soundtrack:** 90s alt-rock (R.E.M., Green Day) singalongs while cooking, because why not dance with a spatula?

**Looking For:**  
A kind, curious partner-in-crime who’s up for:

* **Thoughtful Chats:** Let’s dive into big ideas, silly hypotheticals, or stories about your day.
* **Slow Adventures:** Museum trips, aimless walks, or sharing a café table with books (or *very* strong coffee).
* **Authenticity:** I value people who keep it real. Life’s messy—let’s navigate it with humor and honesty.

**Bonus Points If You:**

* Have a soft spot for 90s playlists or weird historical facts.
* Want to build something meaningful, one conversation at a time.
* Are open to swapping recipes (my pancakes are legendary… or at least edible).

**My Golden Rule:**  
Every connection is a chance to grow. Whether we’re debating the best Green Day album or sharing quiet moments, I promise to approach our time with warmth, respect, and an open mind.

**Perfect Day Vision:**  
Homemade breakfast → museum wandering → getting lost in a book at a café → cooking a flavorful meal with 90s rock as our soundtrack. *Maybe* followed by stargazing and trading stories.

**If You’re Curious…**  
Send me a message! Tell me about your favorite 90s song, a recipe that never fails you, or a place you’d love to slow-travel to (Spain’s plazas and Tokyo’s neon alleys are on my list!). Let’s start with a conversation and see where it goes.

Looking forward to hearing your story! 

*P.S. If you’ve ever butchered a Spanish phrase like “¿Dónde está la biblioteca?”… we’ll get along just fine.*

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’m not in school right now, so I’m hoping to find good spots or activities where I can naturally meet people around my age.

Are there any go to coffee shops, events, or hobby groups that are good for making new connections? Open to any suggestions!

Thanks in advance",3,1738902069.0,Langley,16,0.64,False
1ijmlys,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1ijmlys/another_starbucks_question_getaway/,Another Starbucks Question- Getaway,"Hello cruisers!  Does anyone have a screenshot of the Starbucks menu on Getaway?  Or, can anyone give me an idea of what drinks they make at this location?


I'm assuming the usual hot and iced coffees and lattes are available, but what about the strawberry acaii refresher?  Any sugar free syrups? The new blackberry drinks?  Lemonades?  


Thank you!",3,1738902037.0,NCL,4,1.0,False
1ijmltd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1ijmltd/any_gen_x_children_coffee_drinkers_out_there/,Any Gen X children coffee drinkers out there?,"Growing up, we had three coffee perk o' laters on our Formica kitchen counter. Autocrat coffee in the yellow can with the red swallow mascot on the front, was always a staple in our cupboard. I started drinking coffee at age 5. This seemed normal back then. My school homework was often vandalized by my dad's coffee cup rings on it. Anyone else share this lived experience? 

Edit: I forgot to add the whole milk that was delivered to is from the local dairy in glass bottles with red foil lids on top. The lid would sometimes pop off because of the heavy cream that came to the top! ",64,1738902024.0,GenX,86,0.97,False
1ijmk40,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ijmk40,Help with our kitchen!,"We’ve been wanting to make some simple updates to our kitchen, but I haven’t been able to make up my mind on what to do. The color on our walls is Worldly Gray. Our backsplash is white subway tile. Cabinets are all cheap builder grade. We have an open floor plan with a blue couch and blue accents around. We want to paint the cabinets but can’t decide on a color. We don’t have the money for the bigger Reno we would like to do, but I think painting the cabinets and adding hardware will go a long way.

We’ve known each other for more than a year now and we’ve been good friends. 2 months back a started feeling acknowledging my feelings for various things and stop being in denial and through that, came the feelings for this girl.

2 days back i told her that i wish something could happen between us (Very Brooklyn 99 style lol). I told her that ive felt this way when we went on a standup comedy show a year back, but chose not to act on it because she told me that shes going through something, going as far as getting therapy for it. I told her that i assumed she needed space. 

She told me that she was putting her energy into this during that time too but felt that she was rushing so she held back. She said that she would’ve liked it if i made a move then. Anyhow, she said that she has some stuff going on in her life and she does not want to manipulate anyone. And that its better for us to not be distracted (because we both have exams coming up, i can only assume thats the reason) and that way she can also walk her path. She said she liked that i was being honest with her and that if im looking for an answer, we can talk about it over coffee after our exams. 

I dont why but i said “its alright i was prepared for it. You dont have to answer”. Its been 2 days since this and we haven’t texted again. What does this mean for me and what should i do now. ",0,1738901778.0,datingadvice,2,0.5,False
