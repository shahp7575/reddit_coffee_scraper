I met a very nice woman at Sister Luisa's tonight, and I realized that we didn't exchange numbers. I got distracted because the conversation was so engaging. We connected on our shared interest of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. I admitted that I hadn't seen Star Trek and you recommended Voyager. I think you also mentioned cosplaying as Sheena. I shared about reading the Tolkein books in school, and working in water resources. I'd love to see if we feel the same if alcohol isn't involved over a cup of coffee or so.

1p7wu94,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1p7wu94/the_perfect_society/,The Perfect Society.,"Part I — “When Everything Works”
 
You are standing in the middle of the playground, but you are also sitting on the swing, your small hands clutching the chains as they wobble slightly under your weight. A scrape burns on your knee; the gravel left a tiny scratch that flares when you shift your weight. Your friend approaches, frowning, holding a toy you wanted. You want to shout. You want to cry. You want to run away.
 
But you don’t.
 
You feel the gentle hum of something beneath your thoughts, a soft, guiding vibration that steadies your panic before it takes form. The scrape stings, but your tears are gentle, controlled, meaningful. Your friend’s frown softens instantly, not because they were forced, not because they were told what to feel, but because something within both of you has aligned — the words unspoken, the meaning of the tone, the weight of your own small hearts. You exchange a glance, a nod, and the toy changes hands without a sound. Conflict resolved. You can’t remember exactly why, and it doesn’t matter — you feel satisfaction, a quiet sense of completion. Everything is fine. You always knew it would be.
  
You are now older. Standing in the kitchen, the hum of the refrigerator fills the space as sunlight slants through the blinds. The argument begins quietly: a word here, a tone there, nothing explosive, nothing monumental. You feel irritation bubble like water heating in a kettle, but the sensation never spills over. The other person — your partner — frowns slightly, and your own voice aligns, softening, finding the balance between what is said and what must be understood.
 
GOP whispers to you, not in words but in comprehension. The conflict unwinds. What was once sharp becomes fluid, a negotiation of tone and intention that requires no anger, no shouting, no pain. You both know exactly what the other means, and yet you also know exactly what you mean. Every argument you’ve ever had before is folded neatly into clarity. The air is still. The kitchen smells of coffee. You are both at peace, and you don’t even notice the perfection of it — you simply live it, as if it has always been this way.
  
The classroom is loud in the way a classroom can be when children are children, but the sound is never chaotic. You are the teacher, but you are also the observer at the back of the room, and you are a student, and you are the whisper of the hallways. A student cries softly in a corner, a bully glowers briefly over their shoulder, but you feel the current running beneath the walls, the gentle tide of understanding that pervades everything. One gesture, one glance, one soft intonation — all tension dissolves. The child who was crying knows they are seen, they are understood. The child who acted out knows they are understood. You stand in the room, and the classroom breathes evenly. No one will leave scarred. No one will leave angry. It is, again, simply the way things are.
  
Somewhere above the city, in a room lined with polished wood and the smell of paper and leather, you are a politician. Someone speaks sharply — a critique of policy, a slight misalignment in tone — and you feel the heat of pride, the spark of indignation. But then, it dissipates. GOP does not remove the thought; it clarifies the intent. You hear not the criticism, but the meaning behind it. The conversation resolves itself in minutes that feel like seconds. Legislation proceeds. Compromise forms naturally, without struggle. You stand there and marvel at the absence of conflict, the ease with which disputes resolve themselves. Humanity has learned, in this world, to understand without breaking.
  
And finally, at the border, at the thin line that separates nations, soldiers stand tensely, weapons ready. A small misstep occurs — a foot shifts the wrong way. The other side reacts instinctively. You feel panic rising in your chest, and yet you also feel it dissolve before it becomes action. GOP weaves clarity through fear, aligns perception with reality. Orders are followed, not out of fear, but out of understanding. Conflict evaporates before it can bloom. War is not a memory. War is a concept, a word without weight. The world stands, unbroken, peaceful, functional — perfect.
 
You step back, and you are all of it. You are the child, the adult, the teacher, the politician, the soldier. You feel the soft hum beneath every moment, the invisible hand that guides without control, that clarifies without intrusion. You do not question it. You cannot imagine life without it. And in this perfection, there is comfort, and in this comfort, there is the fragile brilliance of being human untested by struggle.
 
Everything works. And you have always known it would.



Part II — “When Everything Stops”

You wake to the scrape on your knee again, but this time it stings and burns in a way that feels bigger than it should. The gravel is sharp. Your friend yells, or maybe you do. Words stumble out in jagged, uneven fragments. You try to tell them you’re hurt, but the sound doesn’t land. They misinterpret. You misinterpret. Your chest tightens, and tears prick, but they’re not gentle — they’re loud, messy, uncontrolled.

You don’t understand why your small hands shake. You don’t understand why your legs feel weak. The scrape is just a scrape, but everything feels like the world is ending.

No one steps in to clarify. No invisible hand smooths the tension. You are alone in your chaos, and the playground, which once breathed with gentle alignment, now vibrates with misunderstanding. And yet, you are only ten. The weight is too much. You cry harder, and your friend cries too, and suddenly everyone is screaming, and it isn’t anyone’s fault — it’s just being human, unpracticed, unprepared.


---

You are older. You are standing in the kitchen. The sunlight slants through the blinds, but it no longer feels calm. One small critique — an unwashed cup, a word misplaced — sparks a flame. You shout. They shout. Your words collide, ricocheting off walls, bouncing into misunderstandings you cannot parse.

You both cry, but the cries are uneven, jagged, hopelessly uncoordinated. You want resolution, but you don’t know how. You panic. You stomp. You sink to the floor. The other person folds in on themselves like a paper doll, twisting under the weight of emotions you cannot hold.

You are both adults, and yet you feel as fragile as you did at ten. You are screaming, sobbing, grasping for a system that no longer exists. You are all of yourself — and none of yourself at once.


---

You are in a classroom. The students are screaming, some yelling, some crying, some hitting. You are the teacher, but you cannot breathe calm into the room. The bully misreads a glance; the victim panics. You shout instructions, but the words feel hollow. Nothing sticks. Children shriek and run, some colliding into desks, some into each other, some into the walls.

You are exhausted within seconds. You’ve spent decades seeing humans resolve problems before they start. Now, even a simple disagreement becomes a hurricane. The room is chaos. The floor is tears. The walls echo shrill voices, and you feel utterly powerless. You are not guiding. You are surviving.


---

You are a politician. A meeting begins. Someone raises a critique — sharp, piercing, unfiltered. Instantly, panic rises. Voices collide, overlapping, contradictory, incomprehensible. Papers fly. Someone slams a fist. Someone breaks down. Everyone misunderstands everyone else.

Nothing resolves. Compromise is impossible. Orders are ignored. Proposals collapse into cries, threats, and silence punctuated by sobs. You want to reason, to negotiate, to clarify meaning, but the tools you had — patience, empathy, alignment — have vanished. You are all intellect and no emotional infrastructure. You can see the logic of compromise, but your body and mind are toddlers. You cannot act.


---

And finally, at the border, at the thin line that separates nations, soldiers stand tensely. A small misstep — a twitch, a gesture, a misread signal — ignites fear. Panic spreads like wildfire. Commands are shouted but ignored. Weapons are lifted, then dropped, then lifted again. No one can process who is threatening whom.

And you are one of them. You try to understand, to act with clarity, but your mind keeps colliding with your heart and your instincts. Nothing aligns. Fear swells. Miscommunication multiplies. Every reaction becomes an accident, every decision a tragedy in miniature. The world doesn’t end in bombs or fire. It ends in screaming, crying, confusion — a global tantrum that no one planned for, no one could prevent, no one could imagine.


---

You are all of it. You are the child, the adult, the teacher, the politician, the soldier. And yet you are none of it.

The hum that once guided everything is gone. The invisible hand that clarified hearts, aligned souls, translated intentions, whispered peace — vanished. You are left to interpret chaos alone. You stumble, cry, misstep, collide.

You try to stand. You fall. You cry. You scream. You understand nothing, but you feel everything.

And that’s how the world ends.






“Not with war. Not with famine. Not with fire. But with a single, global temper tantrum.""

1p7wrqe,https://regancipher.com/anc-comparison/,ANC comparison tool,"Many of you know me from my YouTube channel and presence here and over at Head-fi, and you'll hopefully reinforce that my approach to reviews is a little more scientific than a lot of the more subjective channels out there, with a focus on measurements and binaural samples and what that means to you in real life. 

I've been toiling with ways to try and bring those measurements to you guys. Obviously my FR measurements are on squiglink, but there's plenty more involved in my testing, and I've finally made a breakthrough with two of those specifics - ANC and transparency effectiveness. 

In my reviews, I take my simulated ears into a coffee shop and on the subway here in London, and record the environmental sound, then the sound the mics detect with the earbuds in, to allow you to hear for yourself what you'll expect to experience. 

Using Room EQ Wizard and blasting pink noise at the ears, I can do the same in a controlled environment and also produce graphs that will show you how effective the noise reduction algorithm for each earbud that I test is at different frequencies. 

For whatever reason. I can't upload pictures to Reddit, so to see it in action you'll have to click the link, but in short, you can compare up to four sets simultaneously, and the grey line is the level of environmental noise in the scene. The further the line is away from the grey line, the better the noise reduction is at that frequency, and the reverse is mostly true with transparency. It's designed to be a bit more interactive, supplementing those binaural samples or subjective views rather than replacing them.

I'll add more models and AI-based explanations in the future, but currently LLMs are very poor at interpreting graphs in this way so it could be a while.

1p7wpjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p7wpjl/i_think_my_18m_girlfriend_19f_is_cheating_on_me/,I think my (18M) girlfriend (19F) is cheating on me,"As the title states, I think my (18M) girlfriend (19F) of 6 months is cheating on me, and there's a couple reasons why.

Background: This past week me and her have been fighting over some things that in my opinion seem a little insane. There's a shopping center close to my house (2 minute walk away) that has a small coffee shop as well as a bank and some other shops. My girlfriend was at this coffee shop, and since she was so close I asked her if she wanted to swing by to see me for a couple minutes. Keep in mind, before this I had not seen her in a week or two. She said she needed to run to that bank before it closed, and so I asked if she wanted to come over after. She had then told me that she was off to see her friend after that, and didn't really want to stop by. I expressed that it made me slightly sad since I hadn't seen her in so long but it was okay if she did not want to come over. She then slightly blew up on me, saying that it was not okay for me to insert myself into her plans and that my life did not need to revolve around her. Okay, maybe she's having a rough day. Then she proceeded to say she was actively with her friend, when previously it was that she was going over to her house. That was a little weird, but I digress. That argument ""ended"",  but emotions were still tense. About a day after, I suggested we start hanging out more frequently so things like this didn't happen. Both she and I are busy people, but regardless I consider our relationship to be a top priority and not a problem to fit into my schedule. She went on to get angry at me, saying that she didn't have enough time to hang out with friends or family let alone me. After this argument, I decided to give her some space in which I did not receive a reply for 43 hours (yes exactly). We decided a time to meet up and speak about things, which I think went very well. She has been going through an emotionally charged time, so I am cutting her some slack on her emotional regulation right now even if she did things to hurt me. Now, let me get into it.

During this time we were arguing, she was reposting things online that could only be related to her Ex Boyfriend (19M), which she dated for the entirety of high school. Things with captions such as ""How it feels to talk to somebody you used to love"" and ""When you think you met the love of your life but he breaks your heart."" Both seem conflicting, but I assume they are both about him. Fast forward to present day, she came over and we hung out. She was a little cautious about showing me things on her phone, but we normally scroll on TikTok on her/my phone on the couch together so this was a little weird. She was quick to close notifications that popped up on her phone, almost as though she didn't want me to see them. I also saw a folder on TikTok that she had that was named after her ex boyfriend with 3 exclamation points. I tried to ask to see some of the videos she had been saving since we were arguing in an attempt to 100% confirm I wasn't delusional in what I saw, but she denied showing me, got defensive about opening it for some reason, and changed the subject. Also, anytime she switched to messages she would slightly turn her phone as to prevent me from seeing something. Another point, since we ""made up"" she hasn't been facetiming me or calling me at night (for context, this was something we did EVERY night since we got together). Now she apparently enjoyed not facetiming every night. All of these things seem a little weird to me, and all of them together make me feel like there's a chance she could be trying to get back with him or if not could be talking to him again (which I would consider cheating since we explicitly talked about not speaking with our ex's) Her environment has also been changing, especially due to the fact she is in college now and is working a lot with some people who may or may not be good influences (I haven't met them for a good feel on them). On the other side of this though, she picked a show for us to watch and we got food and hung out, and she seems okay with kissing and cuddling and such.  
  
Some more background, when her and her ex boyfriend broke up I was the best friend, and she pursued me about 12 hours after they broke up (not kidding). We had an argument similar to this early on and she went back to him and would facetime him at night instead of me. That got solved, and for the past 6 months has been openly shit talking him to everyone including ""to his face"" (through mutual friends that informed him and on social media). 

My question for you guys is do you think this is something that I should investigate further? I think that if I get the chance I will attempt going through her past calls, texts, and maybe her TikTok folder because as much as I do not want to be a overbearing boyfriend, I think this constitutes it. I also am a chronic overthinker, so could I just be overthinking this? Is there a plausible chance she's cheating? Any thoughts would be great!

Some nights
I swear I can hear it—
old worlds changing reels
behind my eyes,
film flapping in the projector
like it’s tired too.

I walk the seam
between what was
and what might be,
hands in my pockets,
heart full of contraband futures
I’m not licensed to carry
but do anyway.

Coffee in my hands
like a minor sacrament,
steam rising
in crooked little prayers
that never learned the words
but still show up
every morning.

One foot planted
on the cracked sidewalk
of “this is how it’s always been,”
the other tapping
to an unruly rhythm
no one’s written down
but I keep hearing anyway.

I never fit,
never really wanted to,
so I started taking notes instead.

I count the glitches—
the half-beat pauses,
the eyes that flinch
at the wrong syllable,
numbers humming quietly
under people’s faces
like secret subtitles.

Static leaves voicemails.
WiFi breathes through walls,
Bluetooth ghosts
drift across parking lots,
and I stand there,
misplaced antenna
trying to tune a station
that only broadcasts
to the bruised and stubborn.

I read the space
between words,
the unspoken clause
that trembles
after “I’m fine.”

Strangers unload
entire lifetimes
over scratched counters
and sliding doors,
just because I asked
how they were
and actually meant it.

Meanwhile,
I’m out of warmth
but still handing out
the last of my fire—
giving away umbrellas
in my own storm,
holding up ceilings
with shaking arms
so someone else
can rest a minute.

My bones know
what my mouth won’t say:
this is costing me.

Born into a relay race
of unfinished debts,
I took the baton anyway
and kept running,
even when the track
turned into broken glass
and family silence.

Knees stiff from cold concrete,
back sore from carrying
everybody’s almosts,
eyes burning from nights
where sleep is an optional update
I keep postponing.

I talk tough,
swear like I’m allergic
to reverence,
but I still file tickets
with the universe—
bug reports on injustice,
crash logs on loneliness—
and the cosmos
auto-replies “received”
in a language
I only half remember.

Love, for me,
is a quiet rebellion
I keep losing
and rejoining.

No posters,
no manifestos,
just unsent messages
stored like backup copies
of a life that almost was.
Names folded small
in the back pocket
of my becoming,
crease lines softened
from all the times
I nearly let go
but didn’t.

I live in the in-betweens—
parking lots at midnight,
side streets humming
with unfinished conversations,
dog pressed against my leg
like a small, warm oath
that I’m not as alone
as the paperwork suggests.

I say I’m done,
that I don’t care,
then stay up all night
rewriting the same prayer
until it looks like
a grocery list
with hope scrawled sideways
in the margins.

Call it stubbornness,
call it faith,
call it a nervous system
that refuses to stop
listening.

All I know is this:

I am here
to witness the glitch
and call it pattern,
to watch the tower fall
and name the dust
a blueprint,

to stand at the bend
where yesterday sighs
and tomorrow fidgets,
bass from some distant car
thudding like a second heart,

and keep scribbling
until the page
starts sounding
like somewhere
a person like me
might finally
belong—

and if you’ve read
this far into me,
you already know
more than most.",1,1764230048.0,fieldnotesofbecoming,0,1.0,False

Her: 21F,  doing a Master’s in Italy
We are both from the same county and met through people from a shared friend group here.

At first I wasn’t super attracted to her, because I wasn't really looking for anything it was when I firstly moved in Italy and still trying to blend in, but as we talked more I developed a very strong emotional connection. Now I’m honestly half in love with her and really struggling with the “grey zone” we’re in.

We started hanging out a lot on campus (3–4 times a week), usually lunch or coffee.

She invited me over to her place twice at night:

Night 1: “Come over for Monopoly”:  we never played, just sat on the couch side by side and talked for hours about relationships, sex, past experiences, emotional stuff.

Night 2: I cooked for her at her place, again couch, again deep, open conversation.

She told me things like she doesn’t easily form deep bonds in relationships, she’s bad at reading “signs”, she’s under stress with studies, she wants to “live in the now and not overthink the future”.

I also opened up emotionally a lot (not as a strategy, it just happened) which is not usual for me. From then on my feelings really escalated.

There have been many moments that feel like we’re a couple, without any label:

Always sitting next to each other on the couch, not opposite or while together in public when someone approach to talk to us, she automatically takes a very couple-like position next to me while standing and talking to the other person.

She’s comfortable asking me to help with intimate house stuff like making her bed,
hanging her laundry together (bras/underwear in plain sight, she’s not awkward about it), cooking for each other, sharing sweets she bakes “and keeps some for me”. She once invited me to sit in one of her classes “so I see what she goes through”.

We have light physical contact (I gently touch her arm/side and she always seems comfortable, sometimes we hug each other especially for goodbye with ""resting"" her head on my chest).

We talk about personal/family issues, stress, sex, exes, future, etc.

So basically: very emotionally close, very “homey” and intimate, but never a kiss, never explicitly romantic (a lot of sexual though) words, although there have been times that I felt we were close but something always keeps her from proceeding.

Key moment:

One night we were both tired, walking very close, almost touching hands all the time. There was a lot of romantic tension, I could feel it everywhere in me and I could tell from her stance she was feeling something similar. In a square, she looked at me with this very intense, emotional look like she was ready to cry and said:

Be patient and everything will be fine.

I told her I trust her. She was not face to face with me, because obviously she was emotionally unstable that night, so she turned her back and walked away to the bus stop while I stood there still watching her going away.
The tension was so high I thought we were one breath away from something happening (kiss, or at least a clearer move). Nothing happened.

After that night, things shifted, after the tension she distanced herself, but her best friend visited, so she was very absorbed with her for 4-5 days.

Her stress about coursework and exams increased a lot (she tells me this openly). Her behavior became hot–cold, with fewer messages.

One time she replied the next day and another one she didn't even noticed the message until we accidentally met each other in the campus 2 days later. She avoids 1–1 night plans more often (mostly about dinners, but then again proposes to go to concerts together).

Example:

One time (at the beginning) we went out to eat just the two of us, it felt like a date and I paid.

Next time I suggested going out, she brought friends and everyone paid separately.

The third time she asked me to go out for dinner after I just came back from Switzerland. I thought we were getting somewhere with her proposing dinner. I arrived at her place to go together to the restaurant. She was well dressed and she was stunning but then she told me that she will have to go to a birthday party at 22:30 and that she's so sorry she didn't tell me that beforehand.

One time she said she doesn't have enough time to hang out at night, but then I see she went out with her friends. That hurt.

Meanwhile I fell really hard for her, sometimes I can’t properly sleep, my heart's racing, constantly overthinking her every move.

Recently: very “couple-like” behavior again

I had no hot water at my place. She basically said “why didn’t you tell me?” and suggested I come shower at hers.

That night:

She was relaxed and nicely dressed at home preparing to go to a birthday party, doing her makeup in front of me.

She cooked for me, asked me to make her bed, we hung her laundry together (again, lingerie in plain sight), we talked about Christmas decorations (once again having the same thoughts and taste), she talked about flowers she likes and her clothes size.

There was playful teasing (I joked “I’ll eat you together with the omelette” in a light, funny way — she laughed it off comfortably with a playful look).

On the metro goodbye:

She hugged me tightly, I whispered “thanks for tonight” and she made a soft, warm “awww” sound while""resting"" her head on my chest, she suggested we meet for lunch/coffee on campus on Monday/Tuesday “like usual”. It felt very “almost relationship”, but her general vibe is still more “safe, close friend” than clearly romantic.

How things feel now

It’s the first time in my life I feel this deep about someone with this level of daily intimacy.

My everyday life is affected: sleep issues, constant thinking, anxiety when I feel “friendzoned”.

I feel like I’m giving 80% emotionally;
she sometimes gives 50%, sometimes maybe less.

At the same time, I know she’s under a lot of pressure with studies. I know she has a history of not forming very deep attachments in relationships. She has told me she wants to live “in the now” and not think too much about later. She says she has a lot of patience and doesn’t get easily crushed or desperate.

We will both be in this city for the next 2 years for our degree, so there’s no Erasmus deadline. That probably makes her feel there is no rush to define anything.

Also, every time I give her space without disappearing, and I’m more relaxed and confident (like this week), she becomes noticeably warmer and more interested again.

A few extra details

Once, when we hadn’t seen each other for days and I was very emotionally off, I ran into her and her visiting best friend by chance on a night out.
I thought she was ignoring me and I was obsessively watching her from a distance,
but later she casually described in detail when and where I met one of her American friends that night, which means she was also watching and listening what I was doing and saying and with whom, while she was her back turned on me and she was talking and listening to another guy, while her friend was holding her from her hand.

She’s called me “darling” several times recently, even in front of her student on a video call and remembers specific details about where I was, with whom and especially dates. I tried to mention some dates that are ""important"" for our relationship and I made a mistake about the date and she corrected me about the exact date. So she’s clearly aware of me, not oblivious.

What I’ve decided for now

Together with some self-reflection and previous advice, I decided to:

Reduce intensity: see her 1–2 times per week on campus, fewer messages, no “always available” behavior, no constant favors,bno acting like a full-time boyfriend (house tasks, emotional dumping, etc.).

Keep being warm but with boundaries: short hugs, light physical contact only if natural, no initiating long “couple-like” nights at her place, keep my own life fully going (friends, travel, hobbies, work/studies).

I am NOT in a crisis right now.
I feel calm and clear-minded, just with this underlying quiet frustration:
I genuinely don’t know her intentions.

What’s eating me inside

It's not that I don't have experience with relationships. I had some girls before in my life, but I have never felt the same for any woman before and also I have never faced this situation again.

My problem is not “how long can I handle this?” – I could handle the current dynamic for quite a while if I knew what direction it might have.

My problem is the ignorance about her intentions: Is this a slow-burn thing where she could see something more with time, once stress eases and conditions are better for both of us?
or does she basically like having me as an “almost-partner”:
emotional closeness, safety, intimacy, some flirt…
but no commitment, no sex, no responsibility — and no real intention to ever go further?

I don’t want to be “boyfriend without title/payoff” while she keeps her real romantic energy for someone else later.

At the same time, I don’t want to force her into a decision right now while she’s overwhelmed with exams etc, or blow up a connection that is clearly meaningful to both of us.

What I’m thinking about doing

My rough plan (open to be challenged): keep this lower-intensity, boundaried version of our connection through the exam period. Focus on my life, studies, friends, sleep, etc.

Observe if she: still actively seeks me out 1–1, keeps the “almost couple” behavior or distances.

Then, after the heavy exam stress is over, when I’m more stable emotionally, I’m thinking of having a very calm, honest talk.

What I’d really like advice on

Am I reading the situation reasonably, or does it sound like I’m romanticizing normal friendship?

Does this “wait until after exam period + then honest talk” plan sound mature, or like I’m postponing the inevitable?

How do I avoid slipping back into “full boyfriend mode without title” while I still care this much? Any practical tips?

From a woman’s perspective:

Could this be genuine “slow-burn, I’m scared/stressed” energy?

Or does it more often mean “I like having you close, but I don’t actually see you romantically enough for a relationship”?

Is there something you think I should change right now in my behavior (either too much or too little)?

I’m not looking for “move on, she’s using you” one-liners or “just confess your love tomorrow”.
I’m trying to handle this in a way that respects both her reality and my own emotional limits.

Friendship","

Hey, I’m Nick. 24. Southern Minnesota.

I’m pretty quiet when I first meet people, but once I get comfortable, I’m that goofy, loyal friend who hypes you up over literally anything. I don’t take life too seriously. I’m mostly just trying to meet people I genuinely click with.

**About me**

If the weather’s even halfway decent, I’m outside. Hiking, biking, fishing, wandering around with no plan, all of it. If there’s even the slightest chance of seeing the northern lights, I’m chasing them. And honestly, laying in the middle of nowhere staring at the sky is one of the best feelings ever.

The gym is my grounding place. I go a few times a week just to keep my mental and physical health in check.

My favorite color is pink, even though I somehow only own black clothes.

I also cook. Like… actually cook. And if we become friends, there’s a good chance you’ll end up getting fed something fancy for no reason other than “I felt like making this.”

I love movies; especially horror, and I have a soft spot for those ridiculous ’90s action films that are so awful they become masterpieces.  
I thrift a lot too. I’m always on the hunt for old Disney VHS tapes and other tapes I can get my hands on

I’m big on physical media in general. Books, manga, movies. if we go thrifting together, I *will* vanish into the book and VHS aisle for an embarrassing amount of time.

Some nights I’m sweating in League or CS, other nights I’m peacefully farming in Animal Crossing. I also love retro gaming. I still use my PS1 and Wii like they came out yesterday.

**My vibe?**  
honestly, if you’re kind, a little weird, and into doing fun random stuff, we’ll get along.

I’ve got tattoos, a closet full of band tees, and a music taste that makes zero sense but somehow works.

If we get along, I’d rather hang out at some point in person! Grab coffee, thrift, movie night, stargaze. (If you're local!)

**Green flags**

* Loyal
* Supportive
* Will actually show up
* Good relationship with my mom

**Red flags:**

* Occasionally clueless
* Slow to open up
* Mental health is a work in progress

**Beige flags:**

* Lives in black clothes
* Night owl
* Will stop everything to point out a cute animal
* Winnie the Pooh is peak comfort

**Music:**  
Everything from Rap to Emo/Screamo to Yacht Rock to Classic Country to Nu Metal. Bowie, Prince, ABBA, Linkin Park, Creed, Steely Dan, Paramore, MCR, SOAD… the list is endless.  
Recently obsessed with South Arcade. if you know them you earn bonus points.

**What I’m looking for:**  
Just good people, honestly. Someone a little weird, up for random adventures or chill nights with pizza and horror movies. Someone who likes talking about hobbies, swapping music, that kinda thing.

If you’re curious, hit me up.

And being in the U.S. (or maybe Canada) makes things easier with time zones! Please refrain from messaging if you aren't. I likely won't respond as such large time zone differences make it hard to have lasting meaningful connections.",1,1764229516.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Part 1

The mornings were never gentle; we only believed they were.

Salt and pine hung in the air like two old perfumes, mingling into something half-sweet, half-rotten, and the sea below hummed with its own low intelligence—a constant murmur that felt more like breathing than waves breaking on the rocks. When I woke before dawn as a kid, it wasn’t the gulls I heard first. It was that sound underneath everything, the ocean thinking.

Hunter would meet me at the path below his family’s house, emerging from the fog like someone stepping out of an unfinished sketch. His glasses never sat straight, his hair never quite obeyed gravity. We’d walk together toward the schoolhouse—an aging trailer perched on the cliff’s edge, as though it were clinging there in fear of whatever lay below. The sea stretched out in front of it, flat and gray and much too wide, like a blank page that had been left out too long.

There wasn’t much on Megoneway: a few scattered houses with curtains that always seemed drawn, a dock where fishing boats arrived once a week with the caution of visitors to a haunted place, and the old lighthouse whose lamp had failed years before but still pointed its dead glass eye toward the horizon. We used to dare each other to look through its windows. We always did, and we always left quickly, too unsettled to say why. Whatever sat inside that hollow tower never felt abandoned. Only patient.

Afternoons were for skipping stones until our shoulders ached, climbing trees that leaned just a little too far toward the water, and listening to the island’s constant whisper beneath the wind. Back then, I thought the world was small—measured in trails, cliff edges, doorways, and the distance between my house and Hunter’s. Small enough to hold. Small enough to understand.

I remember this clearly.

Or I think I do.

Because sometimes, when I drift into sleep now, I see us again on that path, but the air is different. The sky feels closer, pressing down like a ceiling. The ocean doesn’t glitter; it stares. The wind doesn’t touch me; it circles, cautious, as if it senses something approaching that doesn’t belong.

Hunter’s hand finds mine, but his skin is colder than the morning should allow. His mouth moves, shouting something I can’t hear. The sound is crushed beneath a roar that starts in the distance and then suddenly sits inside my chest. The low murmur of the sea deepens until it becomes thunder, then a tearing vibration in the ground itself. The air fills with the smell of smoke and metal, like a burning machine.

The earth shudders, not like earth, but like something beneath it is turning over.

And then—

White.

Not light. Not fog. Not anything I have words for. Just a blankness that wipes away depth and distance and sound in one sweep. The air turns thick and cold, deliberate in its silence, as if it is deciding what to erase.

I reach for Hunter, but his outline is already dissolving. It doesn’t blur; it unravels, piece by piece, like he was never quite solid to begin with. The whiteness swallows him methodically, the way a hand might clear a table.

Just before it takes me, I hear my name.

Not shouted. Not spoken.

Remembered.



The first thing I heard that morning wasn’t my alarm. It was the ocean.

It was always there, murmuring beneath the cliffs like a second heartbeat under the floorboards. Even in our little house, where the windows rattled and the pipes complained, the sea found a way in—a low, steady pulse at the edge of every sound. On bad nights, when the dreams were at their worst, that hum felt like fate. Today, it just felt like a headache.

My alarm shrieked at seven. I fumbled for it, slapped it silent, and lay there for a moment staring at the ceiling, watching faint lines of light seep around the edges of the curtains. Another day of school. Another day of pretending everything was normal. Another day of walking through hallways with people who had once attended my funeral.

I rolled onto my side.

Hunter was already stirring, his profile just visible in the pale light. His glasses were balanced precariously on his nose, as though they’d tried to abandon him in his sleep and failed. His red hair stuck out in three different directions. For a moment, he looked younger like that—closer to the boy I dimly remembered from before everything went white.

“Morning,” I muttered.

He blinked slowly, focusing, like he had to climb back into his body before he could answer. “Morning,” he said. His voice was rough, but there was a hint of softness at the edges he only ever used with me.

Clove Warren. Seventeen. Five foot three. Brown hair that never settled the same way twice. Green eyes people stared at a little too long, like they were trying to place where they’d seen them before. Hunter Hopkins. Seventeen. A little taller, a little sharper around the edges, the kind of boy who always looked like he hadn’t slept enough and had read something terrible at three in the morning.

We lived together in a small rental house on Megoneway, the island I was born on and, depending on who you asked, the island I should have stayed buried off of. To those who had never heard of it, it didn’t exist. To those who had, it was a rumor, a dot on maps that made fishermen frown. For the thirty or so people who still called it home, it was simply the island, said with a tone that carried every memory they’d never talk about.

I pulled myself out of bed, padded to the closet, and pulled on a loose t-shirt, jeans, and worn sneakers. I’d never been much for dresses or makeup; there’s a certain vanity that disappears when you’ve seen your own body turned into a patchwork of scars in the mirror. Still, I brushed my hair, straightened my shirt, made sure my glasses were clean. There’s a kind of armor in looking put together, even if everything underneath feels held together by frayed string.

By the time I stepped into the kitchen, Hunter had coffee going. The smell was harsh, bitter, grounding. We ate in the kind of silence that doesn’t feel empty—just full of things we both know already. He handed me my mug, and our fingers brushed for half a second. Neither of us remarked on it.

“Ready?” he asked after a while.

“As I’ll ever be,” I said.

We walked the familiar path to the school together, our footsteps falling into a rhythm the island probably remembered better than we did. The trailer—the same one we’d gone to as kids, rebuilt, repainted, but still undeniably the same—sat hunched near the cliff edge. The wind tugged at the metal siding. The sea stretched out beyond it, vast and dull and too quiet.

I could feel eyes on us before we even reached the door.

Megoneway didn’t forget things easily. People tried; they built routines, went to work, pretended the cracks in their memories were just age or stress. But they didn’t forget. Not really. I could see it in the way some of the adults looked at me when we passed them in town—the faltering double-take, the quick glance at my wrists if my sleeves weren’t long enough, the way conversation died mid-sentence. I had been mourned here. Buried in the collective memory. And then, one day, I wasn’t.

They’d all thought I died in the explosions. It was easier that way. There had been so many bodies, so much smoke. No one questioned the missing child for long. A grave was dug, a stone placed, a name engraved: CLOVER WARREN. LOVING DAUGHTER. LOST, NEVER FORGOTTEN.

Clove. People had always gotten my name slightly wrong.

Five years later, I walked into a bus station on the mainland with no memory of how I’d gotten there, my body a map of thin, deliberate scars. And a familiar voice cut through the noise.

“Clove?”

I hadn’t known my own name. But I knew his.

The island had not needed to know those details. As far as most people were concerned, I’d been “found.” That was all. The truth lodged somewhere between mine and Hunter’s and refused to move.

That morning, sitting through classes, the hours slid past almost without substance. Teachers talked. Students whispered. Pens scratched paper. I nodded at the right moments, wrote down what I was supposed to, laughed when my friends laughed. On the surface, I probably looked fine. Underneath, something in the air felt misaligned. The hum of the sea through the floor seemed louder. The light through the windows felt thinner, like it had been stretched too far.

It was near the end of the day, when everyone was already counting the days until summer break, that Hunter caught up to me outside.

“Last week of school,” he said, bumping my shoulder with his. “Almost free.”

“Free for what?” I asked. “Working ourselves into an early grave?”

He gave a small, crooked smile. “You say that like we weren’t already doing that.”

We did have a habit of taking on things we shouldn’t. Not monsters or ghosts—nothing that clean. Just… rumors. Bad places. Stories of people who went into the fog and came back different, or didn’t come back at all. Cases. That’s what we called them. It sounded more professional than obsessions.

“That big one,” I said softly. “You still want to go through with it?”

His smile faded. The space between us tightened, like the air itself was paying attention. “We can talk about it tonight,” he said. “After school.”

He didn’t have to say which one.

The one with the girl in the mountains. The one with the scars that looked like mine. The one that, even from a distance, felt like a hand reaching back toward us from whatever had taken me.

We parted ways for last period. The heaviness in my chest followed me into the classroom and settled there, quiet and patient, like it had nowhere else to be.

I didn’t know yet that by the end of the day, I’d be sitting beside Hunter in a hospital room, holding his hand while he tried to crawl his way out of the past.

I only knew that something in the air felt wrong. The ocean sounded too loud. The sky felt too low.

And somewhere, in a place my memory still refused to touch, something was waking up.


Part 2

Leaving Clove at the door of her classroom always felt wrong, like tearing a page out of a book halfway through a sentence. But the school trailer had been built without our comfort in mind, and Mr. Whitlock had made it very clear that my habit of wandering the halls “without purpose” wouldn’t be tolerated this late in the year.

“You’re on thin ice,” he’d said, like the whole island wasn’t.

I walked the narrow corridor toward his class, counting the steps out of habit. The walls felt closer than usual, the air thicker. The chatter of other students slid past my ears in blurred strands—snatches of jokes, complaints about tests, summer plans that involved anywhere but here. I slipped into my seat just as the bell cried out overhead, a strained metallic ring that bounced too long off the walls before dying.

“Punctuality,” Mr. Whitlock said, giving me a look over the rim of his glasses, “appears to be a skill you’re just barely acquiring, Mr. Hopkins.”

“I’m learning from the best,” I replied.

A few kids snickered. Whitlock didn’t. His expression didn’t quite harden, but something behind his eyes shifted, like he wanted to say more and swallowed it back. “Sit,” he said. “If you’re going to haunt my class, you may as well do it from the right place.”

The lesson began. Equations marched across the whiteboard. Pens scratched. The radiator rattled once and then fell silent. After a while, the sound of Whitlock’s voice turned into a dull cadence, syllables blending into each other until they stopped feeling like words and more like weather—something that simply happened around you.

That’s when the feeling started. A subtle wrongness, like a picture on the wall hung a few degrees off-center.

The light overhead flickered. Once. Twice. It dimmed slightly, staining everyone’s faces a washed-out yellow. I tried to focus on my notebook, but the numbers I’d written seemed to curl at the edges when I stared at them too long, like they were trying to become something else.

A low sound drifted through the floor under my feet. It could have been the boiler. It could have been the ocean. It sounded like both, and neither.

I swallowed. My mouth was dry.

“Hunter.”

I jerked slightly. I hadn’t heard anyone come up behind me, but the voice had been right there, too close. I turned my head. No one stood near my desk. No one was looking at me. Whitlock continued scribbling on the board, his shoulders tense.

I must’ve imagined it, I thought.

Then it came again.

“Hunter.”

Not out loud. Not in any way I could point to. It just existed in my mind the way an intrusive thought does, fully formed, not my own.

My hand tightened around my pen, knuckles whitening. The wrongness in the room swelled, like pressure building behind my eyes. The fluorescent bulbs hummed unevenly. The air felt thin and too dense at the same time, like I couldn’t get enough oxygen no matter how deeply I breathed.

I pushed my chair back and stood up.

Every head in the room turned toward me, perfectly in sync. Not with surprise. Not with annoyance. Just—turned, as though they’d all been waiting for me to move.

“Mr. Hopkins,” Whitlock said sharply, chalk freezing in his hand. “Sit back down.”

“I need to—” I started, but the words stumbled. I suddenly wasn’t sure what I’d been about to say. I just knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that I shouldn’t be here. Not in this room. Not in this light.

“You are not excused,” he said. “Sit.”

His tone carried something that didn’t belong to him. It sounded like a rule he hadn’t written, one he was required to enforce. The skin on the back of my neck crawled.

“Hunter.”

The third time, it wasn’t a voice at all. It was a memory of a voice. It pulled at something deep in my chest, the same way Clove’s name had cut through the din of the bus station years ago.

My vision blurred at the corners. The board at the front of the room smeared into white. The hum of the lights merged with the low, distant roar of the sea until I couldn’t tell which sound was coming from where. The floor vibrated faintly beneath my shoes.

Then everything went sideways.

I wasn’t standing in the classroom anymore. I was on my knees under the schoolhouse trailer years ago, hands pressed into cold dirt, smoke rolling overhead. Clove’s small hand was crushed in mine. The fog rolled in, thick and absolute, erasing color, then depth, then sound.

A black-gloved hand reached into the whiteness and closed around her arm.

“Hunter!”

The shout came from far away and right beside me at once. My name, this time, not in my head. The memory shattered. The classroom surged back into place in a flurry of shapes and frightened sounds. Desks scraped. Someone gasped. Then everything went white again—but this time it was hospital light, hard and sterile, and the fog was only the blur of consciousness fading.




The world returned as light. Not warm, not forgiving—just relentless. It pressed at my eyes until I had to squint. Machines beeped in irregular rhythms nearby, like a mechanical heart trying and failing to find a steady beat. Voices murmured beyond a half-drawn curtain, drained of emotion by thin walls and long shifts.

My head rang dully, like I’d pressed a seashell to my ear and couldn’t get the ocean back out.

When I turned my head, Clove was there. Sitting in an uncomfortable plastic chair, hunched slightly forward, fingers wrapped around my hand like her grip was the only thing tethering me to the bed.

“You’re awake,” she said. Her voice was soft, but it carried a tension that had nothing to do with fear and everything to do with recognition.

“What… happened?” My throat felt raw.

“You collapsed in Whitlock’s class.” Her eyes flicked up to the monitors, then to my face. “You weren’t breathing right. The nurse thought it was a seizure. Or maybe a cardiac thing. They said—” She stopped. Swallowed. “They didn’t know what to say, actually.”

There was something in the way she looked at me—a question she’d already answered for herself and didn’t want to hear confirmed.

“I don’t want to be here,” I muttered.

Hospitals meant records. Tests. Numbers that didn’t make sense, charts that raised questions, questions that led to more. I didn’t have anything obviously wrong with me on paper, but I didn’t trust that to last.

“You’re safe here,” she said automatically.

“I’m not,” I said, sharper than I meant to. “I’m not safe anywhere people start asking the wrong kinds of questions.”

Her grip tightened around my fingers. It wasn’t comforting; it was anchoring. “You keep thinking you’re running away from places,” she said slowly. “You’re not. You’re running from what keeps finding you.”

I stared at her. For a long moment, the hospital room felt thinner than it should have, like the walls were just props on a stage and something lay humming behind them.

“Something’s happening to us again,” I whispered.

Her jaw clenched. “No,” she said softly. “It’s not happening again. It never stopped.”

She glanced at the machines. The numbers climbed and fell, small green peaks on black. “Whatever started that day,” she added, “it’s still going. We’re just finally in its way again.”




We left the hospital as soon as they would allow it, which was still several hours later than I wanted. The doctor talked about stress and lack of sleep, about dehydration and diet, about following up if the episodes continued. He didn’t say PTSD aloud, but I could see it lurking behind his eyes, a word he didn’t want to attach to a seventeen-year-old without more proof.

If he’d seen the inside of my head, he wouldn’t have needed proof.

By the time we made it back home, the sky was sliding toward evening. The light took on that muted, almost metallic quality it always did before the fog rolled in. Clove moved around the kitchen in small, efficient motions, making something to eat even though it was clear neither of us was hungry. I sat at the table, staring at the surface of my cooling coffee as though it might rearrange itself into something that made sense.

The episode had left me shaken in a way the others hadn’t. Not because it had been more violent, but because it had felt… synchronized. Like something outside me had decided to replay the memory this time, not my own brain.

“You saw it again,” Clove said eventually, breaking the silence. “Didn’t you?”

I nodded. The words stuck in my throat. “I always see it.”

“The same way?” she asked.

“Mostly,” I said. “Sometimes the angle’s different. Sometimes I think I see more. Or less. But it always ends the same way.”

“With me gone,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“With you taken,” I corrected quietly. “Gone would’ve been easier.”

She winced, like the word itself cut. For a moment, I wished I could pull it back. But there was no gentle version of what had happened. No word that could sand down the edges without lying.

“Hunter,” she said after a while, “is this case really a good idea?”

I looked up. Her face was pale, but her eyes were steady. The question sat between us like a third person at the table.

“We don’t have much of a choice,” I said, because that was easier than admitting the truth: that I didn’t know how to stop.

“That’s not what I asked.” Her voice tightened. “Last night, you told me you dreamed it in more detail than before. Today, you collapsed in class. And you want to go chasing after a dead girl whose scars look like mine. You really don’t see the problem?”

Of course I saw it. That was the problem.

“I can’t ignore this, Clove,” I said. “I’ve been trying to for years, and it’s not working.”

She laughed once, a brittle sound. “You call that ignoring it? Building entire case files, memorizing every strange disappearance within a three-hundred-mile radius, cross-referencing scar patterns and trauma reports? That’s not ignoring. That’s… feeding it.”

I opened my mouth, then closed it again. She wasn’t wrong.

“You think I don’t know I’m obsessed?” I said finally. “I do. I know exactly what this looks like. I know how it sounds when I start talking about fog and patterns and experiments like I’m expecting someone to pat me on the head and say I’m paranoid. But tell me this: if we don’t look into it, who will?”

She didn’t answer.

“If we ignore it,” I went on, “what happens the next time someone like you disappears? The next time someone like that girl turns up on a trail with their skin turned into a blueprint? Do we just—pretend it’s random? That it’s… nothing?”

Her expression shifted at the word blueprint. Her hand drifted unconsciously to her forearm, fingers hovering over the place where her scars were.

“You don’t remember anything,” I said, more gently. “You don’t get the luxury of obsessing over details the way I do. You wake up in a bus station one day with a body you don’t recognize and five missing years. You don’t know where to put that, so you don’t. You just try to keep going.”

“And that’s wrong?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “It’s not wrong. It’s just different. We both survived the same event, but I remember the explosion and the fog, and you remember nothing. I have nowhere to put the images in my head except into patterns. You have nowhere to put your missing memories except into silence. We’re both drowning. I just happen to be screaming while I do it.”

Her shoulders sagged a little. The anger in her face softened into something else—fatigue, maybe. Or sorrow.

“You don’t have to scream alone,” she said. “But you also don’t get to drag me under with you and call it helping.”

The words stung, mostly because they were true. I looked away.

“Then come with me,” I said. “On this one. On this case. Not because it’ll fix anything. Not because it will make the past easier. But because it might be the first thing that gives us something other than questions.”

The room was quiet but not still. Outside, the distant hum of the ocean rose and fell. I imagined the fog already coiling out there beyond the cliffs, gathering itself for one of its slow marches inland.

“Together,” I added quietly. “No secrets. No shutting you out because I think you’re too fragile to handle it. No late-night research spirals without telling you what I’m looking at. If it’s going to eat me alive, you deserve to at least see its teeth.”

Her lips twitched despite herself, not quite a smile. “That’s a terrible metaphor.”

“Yeah, well,” I said. “I’m not exactly well-rested.”

She studied me for a long moment. Then she nodded, once.

“Together,” she said.

The word felt less like comfort and more like a pact.

I got up, went to the bedroom, and returned with a battered folder. I opened it on the table between us. Grainy photos, copied reports, handwritten notes in my own restless scrawl. Clove leaned forward, eyes flicking over the images.

“She was found on a trail,” I said. “In the Smokies. Official cause of death: shock, trauma, blood loss. But look.”

I slid a photograph toward her. A pale arm, half-covered in leaves. Lines cut into the skin in clean, deliberate strokes. Symbols without language. Shapes that meant nothing and everything, depending on how long you stared at them.

Her breath hitched. Her hand ghosted over her own scars as if to compare. There was no need. The resemblance was already obvious.

“They thought she’d been… mutilated,” I said. “Ritual. Psychopath. Whatever word made them feel like they could file her away in a box and forget. But the cuts didn’t go deep. They were shallow. Precise. And the pattern stops right before the spine.”

“Like mine,” she whispered.

“Not identical,” I said. “But close. Close enough to feel intentional.”

“How many?” she asked.

“Four victims so far,” I said. “All within the past month. All young women. Brown hair. Green eyes. Similar height, similar build. It could be coincidence. But we both know it isn’t.”

She didn’t argue.

“Whoever did this,” I continued, “is working toward something. Your scars go further. These look like… earlier attempts. Unfinished drafts.”

The phrase made her flinch.

“You think I’m a finished version?” she asked, voice flat.

“I don’t know what you are,” I said quietly. “I just know you’re alive. They’re not.”

The silence that followed was heavy and strange. She stared at the photo, then at her own arm, then back. Some part of me wanted to reach across and close the folder, to give her even a few more minutes of ignorance. But that part of me was the same part that had tried to “protect” her by keeping things back. And we’d just agreed not to do that anymore.

“So what now?” she asked.

“Now,” I said, “we go where she died. We walk the trail. We talk to whoever found her. We listen to what they don’t think they’re telling us. And we see if the fog there feels familiar.”

“Familiar,” she echoed, like the word tasted wrong. “You think it travels?”

“I think it never left,” I said.

Outside, the light dimmed further. The first fingers of fog began to creep across the distant water, pale and patient, gathering itself for whatever came next.

For the first time in years, my obsession had direction. For the first time since she’d come back, Clove and I were walking into the past side by side instead of dragging each other there in fragments.

It didn’t feel like hope. Not exactly.

But it felt like the beginning of an answer.

And sometimes, that’s even more dangerous.

He looked like the kind of guy who has been retired for  years but still wakes up at 6 am out of habit. Khaki jacket, newspaper tucked under his arm, that vibe. We sat there in silence for a while until he suddenly turned to me and  asked if I knew anything about birds. Not like in a weird way, genuinely curious. I told him  not really, just the basics. Then he goes I think this crow has been following me all week and points across the street. And sure enough there was this big crow perched on the stop sign  staring right at us. He said every morning this bird lands somewhere near him and waits . At first he thought he was imagining it but now he was convinced the crow had a routine.  So we started talking about absolutely random things. His old job, my commute, the weather , how crows apparently remember faces. At some point the crow hopped closer and he whispered like we were in a spy movie don’t look now but he’s coming over. Which, of course,  made me look instantly. The crow puffed up, cawed once, then flew off dramatically like he had  other appointments. The old man sighed and went there he goes again like they were co workers  and he was late to a meeting. When the bus finally came he stood up, grabbed his paper , and said thanks for talking to me kid, most people dont anymore. And something about the way he said it made me feel weirdly emotional. Like maybe it mattered to him  more than I realized. It definitely mattered to me. I got on the bus smiling like an idiot.

Which you might think that this is just another ""rage quit"" postor another petty low blow to them. However, this is not the case.

What I'm about to write is something we should keep in mind, I hate seeing aspiring artists and authors quit because of a good-for-nothing but money generation machines.

Once you stop caring about the technology out there and cut yourself from all that AI fiasco, you'll never feel anxious about AI stealing your art.

I know all kind of art is under plagiarism, I'm well-aware of that, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy art the traditional way. If you're an artist, keep drawing for yourself, if you're a fantasy author, keep writing for yourself. No one will pick up the brush and finish your paint, and no one will hold you papers and call you to finish your plot.

Art is a personal thing, once you realize it, why caring about AI? 

And when you decide to publish it, always copyright your art, when your book is on the shelf, always oppose the AI.

Prime example is Gachiakuta's artist, she clearly said don't feed my work to AI, did that stopped her from being a popular artist? No.


Even if AI is now adopted by the world and the defenders keep doubling down, that's another chance to keep moving. You're a human being, and it's sad to see people degrading themselves and say ""AI does it better than me"". No, even your piece that you call jank has more soul than a perfect AI picture.

1p7w6au,https://www.reddit.com/r/Food_packaging_LOKYO/comments/1p7w6au/decoding_coffee_paper_cups_the_most_popular_sizes/,Decoding Coffee Paper Cups: The most Popular sizes in Coffee Shops,"As a coffee shop operator, you know that every detail matters to customer experience, operational efficiency, and profits. Among the many decisions, the size and type of coffee paper cups (especially single-walled vs. double-walled) may seem simple, but they have a far-reaching impact.  
The right choice can improve customer satisfaction, control costs, and strengthen the brand; the wrong choice can lead to customer churn, increased waste, and reduced profits.  
In this article, we will take a deep look at the most commonly used paper cup sizes in coffee shops and analyze the key differences between single-walled and double-walled paper cups to help you make a wise business choice.

https://preview.redd.it/c0rj8f6e5r3g1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f52ae30aaf1a214b93184c89daeecdbcda28b2b

Personalized custom coffee paper cups are not just containers for coffee, but also a key part of your business:

Customer experience: The feel, insulation, and drinking comfort of the cup directly affect customers’ feelings about the beverage and brand. A hot cup or quickly cold coffee is the fuse for bad reviews.

Cost control: Paper cups are one of the largest items in continuous consumables. Size selection affects the cost of raw materials per cup, and single-layer/double-layer material selection directly affects the purchase price.

https://preview.redd.it/djk8frug5r3g1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87121c1844896ef6a0942336d7fee8e48f776fc4

Operational efficiency: The cup size must match your coffee machine’s cup output, milk tank capacity, and workbench space. The wrong size may lead to production delays, overflows, or inefficiencies.

Brand image: Personalized coffee paper cups are walking billboards. Size, material texture, and printing design all silently convey your brand positioning.

# Coffee Shop Essentials: The Most Popular Paper Cup Sizes

The following are the paper cup sizes that have been proven in the market and are most commonly stocked in coffee shops.

1. 4oz (118ml) – For espresso/small drinks:

* Applicable drinks: Single/double espresso, macchiato, piccolo latte, small cappuccino.
* Business points: Essential size to meet core Italian drink needs. Single-layer cup is the most cost-effective. Make sure the cup can be firmly placed under the coffee machine’s diverter.

2. 8oz (237ml) – Classic “small cup” mainstay:

* Applicable drinks: “small cup” drip coffee, Americano, flat white, piccolo latte, cappuccino/latte (traditional proportions).
* Business points: It is the key size that reflects the value of “standard cup coffee”. Double-layer paper cups can significantly improve the hot drink experience and efficiency (no cup sleeve required), and are a wise investment for professional coffee shops.

3. 12oz (355ml) – “Medium” sales champion (must have!):

* Applicable beverages: “Medium” drip coffee, latte, cappuccino, mocha, Americano, hot tea, and iced force.
* Business points: **12oz coffee paper cup** with the highest sales volume! Double-layer paper cups are a key factor in enhancing customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and a professional image. This size can well balance the amount of drinks, cost, and selling price.

4. 16oz (473ml) – “Large” standard and iced drink main force:

* Applicable beverages: “Large” hot drinks (drip, latte, etc.), almost all iced coffee, iced tea, cold brew main container.
* Business points: **16oz coffee paper cups** are the fastest growing size, especially in the North American market. Double-layer paper cups are the key to improving customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and professional image. Hot drinks must use a double-layer. Ice drinks are cost-effective with a single layer. It is a crucial cup type to increase customer unit price.

5. 20oz (591ml) and above – Exclusive for super-sized iced drinks and special blends:

* Applicable beverages: super-sized iced coffee/cold brew/ice tea, frappuccino-style smoothies, specialty special blends, and “super-sized” hot drinks in some markets.
* Business points: An important size to meet specific customer groups and increase customer unit price. For iced drinks, cost control is the key for single-layer cups. For super-sized hot beverages, the cost-effectiveness of double-layer cups must be carefully evaluated. Ensure that there is enough space on the bar to store and operate large cups.

Conclusion  
12-oz and 16-oz coffee are the absolute best-selling sizes for hot drinks. Double-walled paper cups are recommended to provide an excellent customer experience, enhance the brand's professional image, and simplify operations. Single-walled paper cups are an economical choice for iced drinks and cost-sensitive scenarios.

1p7w6af,https://www.reddit.com/r/elf/comments/1p7w6af/im_launching_the_new_elf_offseason_tracker/,I'm launching the new ELF Offseason Tracker!,"First off, it's still a work in progress, but this gives you a preview.

I've currently integrated the new Offseason Tracker on the main page: [https://elfpedia.eu/](https://elfpedia.eu/)

# New

* All entries are now managed via our own backend and therefore no longer need to be written in endlessly long wiki tables. This significantly improves loading times for you!
* That was a lot of work yesterday, but I've already entered the first confirmed transfers into the database during my testing.
* New is the Nationality field, so you can access this information directly. (As a bonus, I'm also including the country flags.)
* Above the table on the left, you can select the number of entries to display in the top left corner (default: 10).
* Above the table on the right, you can use the free search across tables to filter.

# What's coming next

* Advanced search; this is still a bit of work, but the goal is to combine various search criteria. So i.e., show me all DL and LB from a specific country, or with the status ""Import,"" etc.

# Call for help

* ELFpedia is a lot of work, and we can always use support in any form. So, if you're interested in helping maintain our data - no problem! Knowledge of wikitext or programming is NOT required; I have everything running in backends with their own databases, and it's essentially done via simple forms that need to be filled out. (see attached picture)
* If you'd like to support us with a coffee to help cover server costs, rather than with your work, you can do so here: [https://ko-fi.com/elfpedia](https://ko-fi.com/elfpedia) \- this also helps move the project forward!

Rich history, art, food, and landscapes all packed into a country you can cross in a day by train. There are details and customs worth knowing. Planning a trip to Italy? Stay connected with RedteaGO while exploring this beautiful country. Let's discover [Italy](https://esim.redteago.com/esim-italy) together!

**Did you know?**

* Rome has more fountains than any other city in the world, with over 1,500 providing safe drinking water.
* Venice is slowly sinking at an average rate of 1–2 millimetres per year, and some areas experience regular flooding during high tide.
* The world’s oldest operating university is in Bologna, founded in 1088 and still active today.
* In the Dolomites, you can find the unique pink limestone glow at sunset, known locally as *enrosadira*.
* Cinque Terre’s colourful villages are linked not only by scenic trails but also by a small local train line, making it easy to hop between them.
* Sicily’s Mount Etna is Europe’s most active volcano, with eruptions recorded for thousands of years.

**Etiquette and practical tips**

1. Choose your season wisely Spring (April–June) and autumn (September–October) bring mild weather and fewer tourists. In July and August, expect high temperatures and busy streets, especially in places like Rome and Florence.
2. Check ahead trains High-speed lines such as Frecciarossa make city-to-city travel quick, but rural routes can be slower or less frequent. It’s worth checking Trenitalia or Italo schedules before you set out.
3. Validate your ticket before boarding For regional trains and buses, paper tickets must be stamped in the validation machines at the station or bus stop. Forgetting to do this can lead to fines, even for tourists.
4. Book major attractions in advance The Vatican Museums, Uffizi Gallery, and the Last Supper often sell out weeks ahead in busy seasons. Advance booking saves you both time and disappointment.
5. Church Dress Codes Dress modestly when visiting churches; shoulders and knees should be covered. This is strictly enforced at sites like St. Peter’s Basilica.
6. Know the “coperto” Many restaurants add a coperto (cover charge) of €2–3 per person for bread and table service. It’s a standard part of dining, not a scam. Tipping is modest, service is often included in the bill and locals typically just round up or leave small change.
7. Coffee etiquette is different Coffee culture in Italy is quick and purposeful, most people drink it standing at the counter, which is cheaper than sitting at a table. Cappuccino is typically a breakfast drink. After late morning, locals switch to espresso or macchiato. Ordering a cappuccino after lunch might get you a curious look.
8. Sundays can be quiet Many shops and smaller restaurants close on Sundays, especially outside big cities. Plan your shopping or travel days accordingly.
9. Drink from the fountains In Rome and other cities, public fountains called nasoni offer free, safe drinking water. Bring a reusable bottle to save money and reduce waste.
10. Reliable internet helps a lot An Italy eSIM plan from RedteaGO is handy if you want steady access without relying on café Wi-Fi. If you’re mainly in Italy, [RedteaGO’s Italy eSIM plans](https://esim.redteago.com/esim-italy) are budget-friendly, for example: If you’re exploring more than Italy, the **Europe 37-country plan** lets you use data across most of the continent (France, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Greece, etc.) and some options include calls and texts.
   * **3 GB / 30 Days – $6.00** (perfect for short trips)
   * **10 GB / 30 Days – $11.00** (ideal for heavy Google Maps or Instagram use)
   * **20 GB / 90 Days – $16.50** (great for long stays or digital nomads)

With a little preparation, you’ll spend less time figuring things out and more time enjoying Italy. If you’ve been, what’s one thing you wish you had known before your trip?",1,1764228598.0,RedteaGOGlobal,0,1.0,False

I am not really new to the hobby, i already have two fully painted warhammer 40k armies, but the first one i painted after the GW color scheme and like a beginner and the second one i did not plan beforehand and it became a personal scheme but a very chaotic one.

Now i want to have the third one correct but i dont really have a clue how.

So i want to share what my train of thought is right now and i hope for your help. Keep in mind i can not perfectly use any technique. But at least i have an airbrush and enough models to test.

My goal i an Adepta Sororitas army for Warhammer 40k, in a weeping angels theme from the series dr who. I saw you don't want reference pictures here but a quick google search should explain it pretty well. Its scary living statues. They should look like under the blue night sky with several candles below them for light.

My plan is to prime my minis with Grey Seer Citadel cans, just because i find it faster and easier than airbrush.
Afterwards i plan to use blue grey from AK to airbrush them from the top, then grey blue from AK from the bottom. I then found a video explaining how to make marmor like effects with a wash and coffee strain like work. I plan to use blue and brown wash for this. Weapons and parts of the armour get some verdigris base color before dry brushing brass.

After having all the stone finished i would plan how many candles sit on the base and make candle light accordingly. Therefore I would use white ink in an airbrush and fluorescent orange from Vallejo over it. Then a dark red aurora and a yellow center by hand.

This is the overall plan i have for the minis. I would love to hear some advice, some obvious mistakes, references (i already studied ministurista as the god of OSL) or maybe most important color suggestions.

1p7w3gg,https://i.redd.it/7dxga3un4r3g1.jpeg,The Divorce He Never Saw Coming,"I walked into the law office with my divorce papers clutched in my hand. Four years. Four years as Sophia Moretti, wife of James Moretti, heir to the most powerful mafia family in the city.

Today, it ended.

The lawyer didn’t even look up when I walked in.

""I’d like to file for divorce,"" I said, placing the papers on his desk.

He finally glanced at me—messy ponytail, faded jeans, my backpack still slung over one shoulder. His expression turned stern. ""Young lady, divorce isn’t something you file on a whim.""

I understood why he didn’t take me seriously. I looked like a college student who had wandered into the wrong office, not someone who had been married for four years.

But I was prepared.

""Just stamp the papers,"" I said calmly. ""I’ll get my husband’s signature.""

The Moretti estate was too quiet when I returned. The guards at the gate didn't even blink as I passed—just another invisible fixture in James' world.

I headed straight for James' study. The door was slightly open, and I could hear laughter inside.

Then I smelled it.

Truffles.

James always said he hated strong smells in the house. No garlic, no fish, nothing that lingered. But now, the air was thick with the scent of expensive white truffles, the kind you only get if you are the right person.

I pushed the door open.

There he was. James Moretti, my husband, sitting at his desk, relaxed in a way I'd never seen with me. And beside him was Vicky Rossi, his childhood best friend, back in the city this year after her divorce.

She was feeding him a piece of bread covered in truffles, her fingers lingering just a second too long.

Then James saw me. His smile disappeared.

""Sophia,"" he said, voice cool. ""I didn't expect you back so soon.""

Vicky turned, her perfect red lips curling into a smile. ""Oh, Sophia! We were just having a snack. There's only enough for two, but I'm sure we can—”

""I'm fine."" I cut her off, stepping forward.

I slid the document across the polished mahogany desk, the rustle of paper unnaturally loud in the silent study. James barely glanced up from his whiskey with his glass froze midway to his lips. James' eyes narrowed slightly. ""What's this?""

""The university needs a signed safety liability form,"" I flipped it open to the signature page.

""For my research project,"" I swallowed. ""Since you're my only family now.""

The truth sat heavy between us. My parents had been gone for years, killed in a suspicious car accident that first pushed me into James' world. He knew better than anyone how alone I was.

James frowned, ""Let me see that—"" My nerves suddenly tightened like piano wires. He never asked to read anything. Normally he'd just sign whatever university paperwork I put in front of him without a second glance.

Why today? Why now?

""Oh James,"" Vicky laughed, placing a hand on his arm. ""You're too serious! It's just a form. You remember how many forms we had to sign for the charity gala last month?""

As the heiress to Rossi Enterprises, one of the Moretti family's most important business partners, Vicky had moved effortlessly in James' world since her return. They were always together now, at galas, auctions, and those smoky backroom poker games where deals got made. Everywhere James went these days, Vicky seemed to appear at his elbow, her designer dresses complementing his tailored suits like they were a matched set.

He hesitated, then grabbed his fountain pen and signed with a quick flourish, the same way he signed death warrants and business deals.

I took the papers back before he could see the bold ""DIVORCE PETITION"" header on the first page.

Vicky smirked, ""Honestly, James, you treat her more like a kid sister than a wife.""

James didn't deny it. Just took a sip of whiskey.

I turned and walked out before they could see my hands shake.

The door closed behind me.

I was free.

Walking through the marble halls of the Moretti mansion, I clutched the signed divorce papers in my hand. The ink was barely dry, but the marriage had been over long before today.

I remembered how different James used to be. The way his warm hands would trace my spine when he thought I was asleep. The possessive way he'd pull me into shadowed corners at family gatherings, his mouth hot against mine.

Now he barely looked at me.

My parents died when I was sixteen. Don Moretti, the reigning head of the Moretti mafia family at the time, took me in as a favor to my father—his former driver who'd taken a bullet for him. That's how I ended up living under the same roof as James Moretti.

James was everything I shouldn't want. Cold. Dangerous. Ruthless. By twenty-five, he'd already taken over half his father's operations. The newspapers called him a ""young entrepreneur."" The streets knew better.

I kept my distance at first. Made myself invisible. Until that night four years ago, when James came home covered in someone else's blood.

He found me in the kitchen patching up my own knife wound, a gift from one of his father's men who thought the boss's charity case made easy prey.

James didn't speak. Just took the bandages from my shaking hands and cleaned the cut himself. When his thumb brushed my inner thigh, I should have pushed him away.

Instead, I pulled him closer.

We married three weeks later. A business arrangement, James called it. Protection for me, legitimacy for him. I almost believed him—until Vicky Rossi came back to town and suddenly his late meetings doubled.

Vicky. The Rossi heiress. Their construction empire worked closely with the Moretti family. Since returning after her divorce, And now that her French husband had filed for divorce, she'd become a constant presence——slipping into James' meetings, his cars, his life.

Last month proved it.

I'd waited six hours at Dante's—the restaurant James owned through a shell company—for our anniversary dinner. His right-hand man Michael finally showed up at midnight with a diamond bracelet and an excuse about ""business troubles.""

The next morning, I saw the photos in the gossip column: James and Vicky at the opera, her fingers tucked in his tuxedo pocket where he usually kept his gun.

That's when I started planning my exit.

The divorce papers were my final exam. James signed them without reading—too distracted by Vicky feeding him stolen glances and stolen kisses.

Now, standing in the mansion's gilded foyer, I traced the notary's embossed seal with my thumb. In a month, this paper would be my ticket to freedom.

No more gilded cages. No more pretending.

James could keep his empire. His violence. His Vicky.

I wanted my life back.

Chapter 2

Vicky claimed her penthouse needed renovations after her return. That’s how she ended up in our guest suite—temporarily, of course.

James approved it before I could object. ""The Rossis have been business partners for for decades,"" he said, as if that explained everything.

Now she floated through our home like she owned it—lounging by the pool in designer bikinis, hosting her parties in our wine cellar, always finding reasons to interrupt when James and I were alone.

Tonight, I caught them in the study, heads bent over some legal documents. Vicky’s long finger traced a line on the paper, lingering too close to James’ hand.

""Sophia!"" She smiled when she noticed me. ""We're planning my new home theater. You should join us.""

""I have lab reports to grade,"" I said, clutching my nightgown. We're divorced now. Whatever James does. Whoever he's with. It's none of my business.

Vicky's laugh tinkled like broken glass. ""Always buried in your books! James used to do my math homework when we were kids - you tutored me yourself, didn't you James? My math skills are all thanks to you.""

James chuckled lightly. ""Math was simpler than laundering casino profits."" His eyes flicked briefly to me, a silent check for reaction.

I kept my face carefully blank, staring at my feet. How touching, their childhood bond still going strong after all these years. I'd just be here, counting the days until I could escape this charming reunion.

By midnight, I was reviewing lab data when James entered our bedroom. The scent of whiskey and Vicky’s cloying perfume clung to his shirt as he sat beside me on the bed.

""Still working?"" His fingers brushed my shoulder.

I stiffened instinctively. Yet when his hand slid down my spine, I arched into his touch like a starving woman offered crumbs.

Pathetic, some rational part of my brain whispered. But four years of loneliness had carved a hollow space inside me that only James could temporarily fill, even if he'd never stay.

His lips found my neck as he unbuttoned the front of my nightgown. I closed my eyes and let myself forget—

—until my stomach turned violently.

""Sophia?"" James froze as I clapped a hand over my mouth.

The queasy feeling disappeared as fast as it hit me. ""Just...ate something odd at the lab today,"" I offered weakly. The birth control pills I took religiously made pregnancy impossible, but my stomach seemed to rebel at the thought of Vicky sleeping right beneath us while James touched me.

Just then, a crash came from downstairs.

""James?"" Vicky’s voice floated up the staircase, trembling. ""I heard glass breaking... I think someone’s in the house.""

I felt James’ body tense. Duty called.

He was out of bed before I could speak, grabbing the pistol from his nightstand. ""Stay here,"" he ordered, already halfway to the door.

Turned out to be nothing—just the housekeeper dropping a plate. But when James returned hours later, he went straight to the shower without a word. I pretended to be asleep.

The next morning, I nearly choked on my coffee when I saw James flipping through my research institute application forms—the ones I’d stupidly left on the kitchen counter. My stomach tightened.

""Biomedical engineering?"" He held up the application to the Swiss institute's application, his brow arched. "" When did you arrange this overseas project?""

I forced a shrug. ""My classmate asked me to grab the forms for her."" My fingers curled into my palms—out of sight, out of mind—but not before I caught the faint tremor in my pinky finger. Damn it.

James turned a page, scanning the details. ""Zurich. You’d hate the snow.""

Of course he didn’t remember. Two winters ago, I’d dragged him to a cabin in Vermont just to watch the flakes fall. He’d spent the whole time on the phone with his lawyers.

I didn't respond. Just look at him coldly.

He set down his coffee, his dark eyes locking onto mine with unsettling intensity. ""You don’t need another degree. I could appoint you lead researcher at Moretti Medical tomorrow.""

That’s the problem. Every achievement I had, every paper, every grant, was shadowed by the Moretti name. I opened my mouth to retort when Vicky’s laughter cut through the tension.

""Morning, darlings!"" She breezed in, her silk robe fluttering as she perched on the arm of James’ chair. ""James, the lawyers need us to review the new casino contracts before noon."" Her slender fingers brushed against James' shoulder in a familiar gesture.

James stood up without another glance at my applications. ""We’ll take it in the study.""

As they disappeared down the hall, I yanked the forms back. My hand steadied as I reached the Marital Status.

Single.

Chapter 3

The research fellowship in Switzerland would last for four years. The director had emailed twice already, eager for me to start by fall. Four years abroad. Far from James. Far from Vicky. I sent ""Accept"" before I could overthink it.

Last night played on repeat in my mind. I'd actually considered—just one last time—initiating something with James. A final memory to take with me. But he'd spent the evening with Vicky, probably whispering sweet nothings under the moon.

That's the difference between love and...whatever this is.

What I couldn't understand was how a man could feign desire so convincingly for someone he didn't love. To prevent a repeat of last night's humiliation, I decided to clear out my things today. Three weeks until the divorce was finalized. Three weeks of avoiding this house.

Most of my life was already at campus housing—just one suitcase of clothes here. The only personal item was the photo album in the nightstand.

I flipped through the thick leather cover. Every month like clockwork, I'd dragged James to a photo studio. Me smiling like an idiot. Him stiff as a statue, looking anywhere but at the camera.

The album landed in the trash bin with a thud. Even the recycling truck wouldn't want this tainted love story.

For years, I'd been an audience member in James Moretti's life. Now the curtain had fallen. Time to make my exit.

The next two weeks blurred with thesis revisions and lab work. I barely thought of James—until his call interrupted my Friday research meeting.

""I'm outside your lab,"" his voice crackled through the phone.

Since when does James Moretti play chauffeur?

His black sedan idled at the curb. I slid into the leather seat, inhaling the familiar scent of his cologne and gun oil.

""You haven't been home."" His eyes stayed on the road.

""Lab's busy.""

""Good."" His fingers tapped the steering wheel. ""Vicky thought you were avoiding her. She's moving out next month—says it's 'inappropriate' now.""

I yawned. ""Tell her not to bother. I don't care.""

James' grip tightened on the steering wheel, his knuckles paling to bone-white. A flicker of surprise crossed his face. He opened his mouth—probably to praise my ""maturity""—but stopped when he noticed my closed eyes.

I feigned sleep to avoid conversation, but the exhaustion was real. For the first time in years, my dreams weren't about him.

Ten days until Switzerland.

I stood in the supermarket aisle, staring at the dried hawthorn slices in my hand. I hadn't eaten these since childhood, but lately my stomach churned at everything else. My recent period had also been delayed.

The pregnancy test confirmed my fears.

""twelve weeks along,"" the doctor said cheerfully. ""Congratulations!""

I nearly laughed. Twelve weeks. That meant it happened during James' and my last time together—right before Vicky returned.

My hands shook as I dialed James' number. At twenty-four, facing this alone terrified me—

A familiar ringtone echoed down the hallway.

James stood twenty feet away, his black coat draped over Vicky's shoulders as she whispered something that made him smile. I hung up and ducked into the stairwell.

""—avoid strenuous activity,"" the doctor's voice carried through the cracked door. ""And no intercourse for two months.""

Vicky was pregnant too.

""I'll make sure she rests,"" James said, that tender tone I rarely heard.

I shot out of the stairwell like a bullet, desperate to escape, only to crash straight into a nurse carrying medical charts. The papers went flying as we collided, creating just enough noise to draw attention from down the hall.

James emerged from the examination room just in time to see me scrambling to help pick up the scattered documents, my face burning with the effort to appear composed.

""Sophia?"" He frowned, stepping forward. ""Why are you here?""

""Stomachache."" I crumpled the ultrasound slip in my pocket.

Vicky materialized beside him, clutching her own scan. ""James told me you skip meals."" She patted his arm. ""We should get her some ginger tea.""

I couldn't tear my eyes away from the ultrasound photo in Vicky's hand. The grainy black-and-white image seemed to pulse under the harsh hospital lights.

James' face went pale. ""Sophia, let me expl—""

""James!"" Vicky's fingers dug into his sleeve like claws, her voice dripping with false sweetness. ""We talked about this.""

I saw the conflict play out across his face, the way his muscles tensed, how his hand twitched before curling into a fist.

Then Vicky pressed her cheek against his shoulder, whispering something that made him freeze. His arm dropped to his side like a dead weight.

I turned away before they could see my face crumple. Behind me, I heard James take a half-step forward—

""James!"" Vicky's voice turned sharp. ""You promised.""

The elevator doors closed on the image of my husband standing frozen between two women, his eyes locked on me with something that almost looked like regret.

Outside, winter air slapped my face. The research acceptance letter lay buried at the bottom of my backpack. Four years. A groundbreaking study. A life far from this mess.

And now—a baby.

My hand rested on my stomach—still flat, but everything had changed. The sidewalk stretched endlessly in both directions.

For the first time in my life, I had nowhere to go.

Chapter 4

For forty-eight hours, I'd been drafting and deleting emails to the research institute. How do I tell the director I accidentally pregnant by my soon-to-be-ex husband? My fingers hovered over the keyboard when my phone buzzed.

Michael: Boss wants to see you at the gates.

Since when did James send his right-man as a messenger boy?

I spotted James leaning casually against his Mercedes, the morning sunlight softening his sharp features in a way that made my breath catch for a moment. The way the light traced his jawline, the slight crinkle at the corners of his eyes as he noticed my approach - it was unfair how my pulse still quickened at the sight of him after everything.

I quickly looked away, fingers fumbling with my backpack strap as if it demanded all my attention. Four years of marriage, and my traitorous body still reacted to him like we were newlyweds. The heat that rose to my cheeks, the way my skin remembered his touch - biological betrayals I refused to acknowledge. Old habits, I told myself firmly. Just muscle memory, nothing more.

""Sophia."" He removed his glasses, revealing those dark eyes that used to make my knees weak. ""Dinner tomorrow. Dante's. Eight o'clock.""

Dante's. The name alone sent acid creeping up my throat. That was where I'd sat for six hours on our anniversary, staring at cold osso buco while James ""handled business"" with Vicky.

""I'll be there,"" I heard myself say, the words leaping from my lips before I could temper them. The automatic response surprised even me—why so eager to sit across from the man who'd chosen Vicky over me at every turn?

But hesitation would raise suspicions. James could smell weakness like blood in the water. If I was going to keep this baby—and I had every intention to—I needed to do things right. Hiding the pregnancy meant nothing if I didn't first sever all legal ties between us. James Moretti wasn't the type to let anything slip through his fingers, least of all a child. And if he ever found out I'd kept his heir from him...

No. The divorce had to come first. Clean. Official. Irreversible.

This dinner would serve two purposes: First, the divorce. Then, when oceans separated us, I'd decide how to tell him about the baby. If ever.

The restaurant's chandeliers cast knife-sharp shadows across the white tablecloths. Tonight, he'd chosen the private wine cellar where we'd had our first date.

His fingers wrapped around mine as he set down the Barolo bottle—not just brushing past, but actually holding my hand for the first time in four years.

""There's something I need to explain about what happened—""

The cellar door crashed open. Michael rushed to his side, looking strained.

""Mr. Moretti, Ms. Rossi cut her wrist. She is in the ER now...""

I know this story is mildly outrageous and sounds like some 16yo drama but I promise it is all real life, unfortunately, and not AI. 

I (38F) dated A-30sM (3 months) and B-30sMtF (2 years). A year before any of that I went through a divorce that was pretty bad on my mental health. During that time, I became close friends with C-30sF. 

A and I went to a festival and I realized I wasn’t what he was looking for in a relationship. Due to my divorce, I wasn’t there yet and realized I needed to break things off cause stringing him along at the fast pace rate he was moving seemed toxic AF. I was going to talk to him when I returned. C meets up with us Day 2, she had only met A ONE time prior to this and it was at a concert so they didn’t talk. I tell C what’s going on with me mentally and I felt like such a shitty person about all of it. 

C decides to tell A everything I said and pretty much broke up with him for me. I was obviously upset spent the whole time there by myself and isolated - they took over the camping area, I paid for, my tent, car everything. We return, she tells the whole friend group if they talk to me she isn’t talking to them and proceeds to be best friends with A. 

Over about a year A starts to talk Tod me again at concerts, met B, hung out a few times but only at shows and concerts so again not much talking at all. 

B and I took a break over the summer, B and C ran into each other and that’s the first time B and C exchanged numbers - to meet up at the event if they needed anything. No conversations before this and none after until…

B and I called it quits in September. Well, more like B discarded me and it will take years of therapy to undo the lying and gaslighting. C texted me, I was out of town for work, in October cause she saw my insta stories asking if we were still together, if I was ok… I felt safe and told C all of the shit I had been processing. 

10 days later, B and C met up for coffee and a beach walk, unbeknownst to me. 

C and I have talked multiple times since their little meet up, she also just went through a bad breakup… she NEVER mentioned it. Then C met up with B again after for coffee and even told them about the conversation we had… still no mention of it to me. 

I have blocked C on everything, didn’t even reach out to see if she had any explanation. I don’t even think it’s worth the energy.

Additional context: C never sought any romantic relationship with A and would not date B because of sexual preferences. So that’s off the table. ",1,1764228312.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

# 1️⃣ Queen Victoria Market

More than just a market — it’s food, culture, weird souvenirs, coffee, and the best people-watching in the city. Go hungry. Grab a doughnut from the American Doughnut Kitchen van if you know, you know.

# 2️⃣ The Royal Botanic Gardens

Melbourne at its most peaceful. Perfect for a stroll, a picnic, or just lying under a tree pretending you’re not jet-lagged. The views over the lake and the Shrine are unreal.

# 3️⃣ Fitzroy & Collingwood

This is Melbourne’s personality concentrated into two suburbs. Street art, indie shops, record stores, rooftop bars, vintage clothing, weird bars, amazing food. If you want the “Melbourne energy,” it’s here.

# 4️⃣ St Kilda & the Pier

Beach, boardwalk, sunset, penguins (yes, actually), and a classic Melbourne vibe. Grab some fish and chips, walk the pier, and enjoy one of the best sunsets in the city.

# 5️⃣ The National Gallery of Victoria (NGV)

Free entry, world-class exhibitions, stunning architecture, and one of the most photographed water walls in Australia. A must-do even if you’re not a big “museum person.”

We hit it off and realized that we had a mutual friend in common.  He is at the end of getting a divorce ( he filed six months ago. He moved out of their home and purchased his own condominium )and our mutual friend seemed excited for us to get to know each other as she thought we would be a good match. He asked me out on a coffee date which went very well and he sent a lovely note after thanking me for taking the time and saying how much he  enjoyed it Then I got a phone call from our mutual friend that his soon to be ex-wife Heard about the coffee date and got very angry. She screamed at our mutual friend, thinking that she had somehow set us up which she did not and created some problems -after that he seemed to cool. We saw each other at some industry events and we were flirtatious, but he didn’t ask me out again however he was on a short speaking tour and he wasn’t really in town very much. He has four children so when he is in town, he spends most of his time with them. This was about six weeks ago over that time. There were a couple of check-in over Instagram, but I noticed that he wasn’t checking my Instagram stories as much over the last two weeks or so then we both were speaking at another convention a couple of days ago -we saw each other and greeted each other warmly. I still felt the spark. He seemed genuinely happy to see me but again didn’t make any overtures to set up another date. I never really gave much thought to the fact that his soon to be ex-wife was so angry about me and I suppose that could factor in somehow although I’m not giving it that much weight I mean he’s an adult man he can do what he wants anyway he has a business account That started following me about a week ago although I know it’s not just him on the account. it’s at least him and his assistant, but I was surprised to see that he unfollowed me on his private account that is actually not public. I mean, if the wife wanted to see who he was following, she easily could, and to be honest it hurt me. I did not expect that. I actually thought that this would be more of a slow burn and that I would give him times since he’s dealing with a divorce, and I wasn’t in any rush to get to know him that quickly and was feeling encouraged by our Connection, even though with all the traveling there wasn’t a lot of follow through. I know that reaching out to him directly and asking him why he felt the need to Unfollow me on his own account and yet still follow me on his business account. Seems like it would be counterproductive if I want to still be available should he want to explore this connection in the future  his friend that is my mutual friend is not a very close friend, but I do think if I mentioned to her that he unfollowed me and if I’m honest and say that it did hurt my feelings that it will get back to him I’m not sure that that’s a huge problem, but I did want to run it through the filters of Reddit community. 
I would really like to keep the door open because people do sometimes come around again when their lives calm down and that would be lovely, but I also would like to be honest with my friend and hope that she doesn’t spin it in a way that makes it seem like I’m Devastated or something like that.

My wife decided it was time to go to the stopping mall. She needs new clothes, a new designer bag and our son needs some toys. I am hesitant to bring up that I need new freshly roasted coffee from the local shop. With all my courage I bring it up and had to come up with several reasons why the cheaper supermarket beans aren't cutting it. I know it won't be my greatest night after bringing this up but I win the argument. 

Happy as a child I come home and start to pull my beloved espresso shot. ""Damn it's way to finely grinded, the beans must have been fresher than expected"", one shot two shots eventually 4 shots are wasted in the dialing in process. While I am enjoying my well balanced espresso I start to think about the fact I almost used 100gram of my 250gram coffee bag for this espresso. 

I start to sweat thinking if I would want to go through this ordeal again next week having another weekend with a grumpy wife. ""Should I change my taste buds and accept stake supermarket beans or Nespresso?"" Or ""Should I divorce my wife losing half of my possessions""? Though decisions while I only wanted to enjoy a nice espresso.""

Obviously this is a massive exaggeration of events but regardless it never feels nice to throw away espresso shots during the dialing in process. After the introduction to Turboshots I was able to massively reduce my waste and it feels so nice. The only change I made is to start on the coarser end of the scale and using a bigger cup which allows atleast 60ml. When I see the flow rate is to fast I just go for a 1:3 ratio trying to aim for a 15sec shot. I still throw away some shots when I come closer to my extraction time of a 1:2 ratio but I am happily settling with a turboshot which on its own brings up other tones from the coffee bean.

What's your opinion on Turboshots and how do you use it? All the time? Or you mix it up? Or like me just to safe a bad shot?

Agricultural commodities, including rice and grain, require precise protection during global shipment to counter moisture, pests, and spoilage risks. Utilizing specialized hermetically sealed container liners is a crucial strategy for container liners suppliers. These liners establish a low-oxygen, high-carbon dioxide environment, effectively controlling pests without chemicals and precisely regulating moisture to maintain product integrity. This technology extends shelf life, locks in nutritional value for storage of food grains, and dramatically reduces product loss, securing commodity value.

I imagined storms ruining plans constant mud and feeling stuck inside a tiny space with nowhere to go. But one rainy weekend completely changed how I see life on the road. I was parked near a state park and the rain poured nonstop for almost two days. At first I panicked no hiking no exploring no chance to enjoy the scenery I had come for. But then I decided to just slow down. I brewed a big pot of coffee pulled out a stack of books I’d been neglecting and watched the rain hit the roof of my RV. The sound was soothing in a way I hadn’t expected.

By the second day, I even found myself walking outside under a raincoat jumping over puddles and laughing at how much fun it could be. Cooking comfort food in my tiny kitchen hearing the water hit the windows and knowing I didn’t have to rush anywhere made the whole experience strangely comforting. That weekend taught me that RV living isn’t just about sunny adventures it’s about learning to enjoy life even when conditions aren’t perfect.

# Introduction

Leaving home for a foreign university tests your resolve. The journey offers immense rewards, but pitfalls exist. Many students fail to prepare for life overseas. Money, time, and opportunities get lost. You must avoid these common errors to succeed.

**Here are the top 10 mistakes students make when studying abroad:**

# 1. Sticking to a Home Bubble

 Fear drives students to find comfort in groups from home. This choice limits cultural exposure. You miss the chance to learn a new language. Local customs remain a mystery. Break away from familiar faces. Make friends with locals. Consider a student from India in London. He lives only with other Indians. He eats only Indian food. He returns home without better English skills. He fails to understand British culture. **Isolation wastes the global opportunity. Join a local club instead.**

# 2. Mismanaging Finances 

Living costs in foreign cities will shock you. Students often treat the first few months like a vacation. Money disappears quickly on eating out. Funds will run out before the semester ends. Create a strict weekly budget before departure. Cook meals at home to save cash. Track every dollar spent. A student in New York might spend $20 daily on coffee. This habit costs $600 a month. These funds pay for textbooks or utilities. Buy a coffee maker. **Save the difference.**

# 3. Underestimating Academic Rigor 

Foreign universities demand independent study. Professors will not spoon-feed information. Plagiarism rules are strict. Consequences are severe. Citations are mandatory. Read the syllabus immediately. Start assignments weeks in advance. A student submits an essay with copied paragraphs. The university expels her for academic dishonesty. Her visa gets revoked. She returns home in shame. **Write your own words.** **Use library workshops to learn proper citation methods.**

# 4. Breaking Visa Regulations 

Immigration laws are unforgiving. Working excess hours invites deportation. Ignoring expiration dates causes legal trouble. Read visa conditions carefully. Follow every rule precisely. Do not risk education for a quick paycheck. A student in Canada works 30 hours a week off-campus. The limit stands at 20 hours. Immigration officers discover the violation. They deport him. They ban his reentry for five years. **Monitor work hours strictly. Report status changes to the international office.**

# 5. Neglecting Mental and Physical Health 

Stress hits hard when family is far away. Many students ignore illness symptoms. They ignore signs of depression. The situation becomes an emergency. Healthcare without insurance costs thousands. Secure comprehensive health insurance before departure. Locate the campus clinic during orientation. A student ignores a toothache for months. The infection spreads. Emergency surgery costs $5,000. He lacks dental coverage. **Routine checkups prevent financial pain. Prioritize well-being.**

# 6. Choosing the Wrong Housing 

Cheap rent often means a dangerous neighborhood. A low price implies a long commute. Distance wastes valuable study time. Energy gets lost on buses. Research the area thoroughly. Read reviews from past tenants. Prioritize safety over saving a few dollars. A student rents a basement apartment to save $100. The commute takes three hours daily. She misses morning classes. Her grades suffer due to exhaustion. **Choose housing near campus. Time holds more value than cheap rent.**

# 7. Suffering in Silence 

Pride prevents many students from asking for help. They struggle with coursework alone. They fight loneliness in secret. Universities offer counseling and tutoring. Use these resources. Advisors want to assist. Speak up early. A physics student fails two exams. He fears judgment. He tells no one. He fails the course. He loses his scholarship. A single meeting with a tutor would have saved his grade. **Visit professors during office hours. Ask questions when confused.**

# 8. Packing Unnecessary Items 

You do not need a year’s supply of toiletries. Heavy kitchen appliances create a burden. Airlines charge high fees for excess baggage. Hauling heavy bags exhausts the traveler. Most daily items are available locally. Pack essential documents. Bring prescription medicine. Buy the rest upon arrival. A student packs a rice cooker and winter coats for a summer term. The airline charges $200 for overweight luggage. The voltage difference destroys the appliance. Check the weather. **Pack light. Buy household goods locally.**

# 9. Delaying Career Networking 

A degree alone guarantees nothing. Students often wait until graduation to look for jobs. This delay is a mistake. The job market is competitive. Attend career fairs during the first semester. Connect with professors. Build a professional network immediately. A graduate with high grades applies for jobs in May. He has no contacts. A classmate with lower grades gets hired. She interned in January. She met the recruiter at a campus event. **Start building relationships on day one.**

# 10. Disrespecting Local Norms 

Every culture operates on unwritten rules. Loud behavior might offend locals. Specific gestures imply insults. Ignorance marks you as an outsider. Observe how people interact. Listen more than you speak. Respect the host culture. You will gain respect in return. A student tips a waiter in Japan. The staff member feels insulted. Tipping is rude in this culture. The student feels embarrassed. R**ead about cultural etiquette before travel. Adapt behavior to fit the environment.**

# Conclusion

Success abroad demands proactive effort. A degree requires more than attendance. You must build a life. You must manage a budget. Respect the laws of the host country. **Take responsibility for the experience. Make smart choices daily. The future depends on actions taken now.**

I’ve been exploring **Ayurveda** for gentle, consistent detox methods, and I wanted to share a simple practice that has made a noticeable difference in my energy and **digestion**—the **Warm Ghee Morning Ritual.**

It's literally just adding a teaspoon of quality [A2 Ghee](https://kamdhenugauveda.com/product-category/a2-ghee/) to a cup of warm water and drinking it first thing in the morning.

# Why I Started (and Why it Works):

I was feeling sluggish, and my digestion was irregular. The traditional Ayurvedic explanation for this is often an accumulation of **Ama** (toxins) in the body. Ghee is the antidote used in many cleansing therapies.

* **The Gut Connection:** Ghee is essentially a healthy fat that acts as an **internal lubricant**. When you drink it, it helps smooth the passage of waste through the intestines. This promotes more regular bowel movements and helps clear out the build-up that causes sluggishness. It’s a very gentle, natural **gut cleaner**.
* **The Detox Carrier:** Ghee is known as a *deep-penetrating* substance in Ayurveda. It has the property of binding to fat-soluble toxins in the body's cells and helping to draw them out, carrying them toward the elimination pathway. It’s a daily, gentle detox rather than a harsh cleanse.
* **Balancing the System:** For those familiar with **Doshas**, this is fantastic for pacifying **Vata** (which governs movement and can cause dryness/constipation) and is highly nourishing.

[A2 Ghee](https://preview.redd.it/r07rkbjlzq3g1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0016a2ad2a1835d9820bbee7803a668c9443d3bf)

# The Ritual (The How-To):

1. **Water:** Heat up about 8 oz of filtered water until it is pleasantly warm (like a weak tea).
2. **Ghee:** Stir in **1 teaspoon of high-quality A2 Ghee**. (The quality matters here—look for traditional **Bilona method** ghee.)
3. **Timing:** Drink this on an empty stomach. Wait 30-45 minutes before having your coffee or breakfast.

1p7vlee,https://www.reddit.com/r/RVLiving/comments/1p7vlee/the_unexpected_joys_of_living_on_the_road_full/,The Unexpected Joys of Living on the Road Full Time,"Last year, I took the leap and started living in my RV full time and honestly it’s been a mix of chaos adventure and surprisingly small joys. At first I worried about how tiny the space was and whether I could adjust to living with minimal stuff. The first few weeks were rough I forgot to empty the gray water tank twice ran out of propane unexpected l , and struggled to find spots to park where I felt safe and comfortable. But slowly, the rhythm of life on the road started to make sense. I began noticing little things I never appreciated before: waking up to the sunrise over a quiet lake sharing coffee with strangers who quickly became friends at campgrounds and realizing that a clean, organized  space can feel cozier than a big apartment ever did. Even grocery shopping became an adventure planning meals around what could fit in my tiny fridge forced me to get creative and I discovered new recipes along the way. What surprised me most is how much freedom comes from living smaller. I have fewer distractions less clutter and more time to focus on what really matters exploring, reading hiking or just sitting outside listening to birds. It’s not perfect and there are still days when I miss having more space or a normal routine but the tradeoffs have been worth it.

I’d love to hear from others what small, unexpected joys have you discovered while living the RV lifestyle that you never anticipated before hitting the road",2,1764226576.0,RVLiving,2,0.75,False

Tried it in my coffee this morning and it actually worked well, didn’t leave any weird taste. Then I used it in a small batch of cookies and they came out pretty normal, texture-wise felt almost like sugar.

I’m curious if anyone here cooks or bakes with allulose regularly. Does it behave differently in larger recipes? Any tips or things to watch for with texture or digestion?

Welcome to the **official Advent Calendar master thread,** the place to hang out, compare notes, share brews, debate tasting impressions, and collectively lose our minds over how fast December is flying.

Whether you’re brand-new to specialty coffee or someone who casually owns ten different brewers and have a dedicated brewer shelf, you're welcome here. There’s no right way to taste these coffees. 😊 We'll just share curiosity, good vibes, and maybe the occasional “wait… am I actually tasting jasmine or am I imagining things?” moments. 

# What to Expect Here   

Every day, we’ll update this thread with:

* the **daily coffee reveal**
* tasting notes + process info

You’re invited to jump in with:

* your own tasting notes
* your brew method of the day
* your triumphs (“I nailed the extraction!!”)
* your “I did not expect that” reactions

Lurkers are welcome. Enthusiasts are welcome. Over-caffeinated December zombies are welcome.

# Spoilers

We’ll tag each day as clearly as we can so you can scroll carefully if you’re opening yours later in the day, but do know that coffee info (spoilers) will be here!

1p7vi8c,https://i.redd.it/tz67gs82yq3g1.jpeg,My gentle experience with Ho’oponopono & blue solar water (it truly changed how I feel inside),"Over the past few months, I’ve been diving deeper into natural healing practices. By chance, I came across the book **“Zero Limits”**, and it opened a completely new door for me.  
Since then, I’ve been practicing **Ho’oponopono** every day with the four simple yet powerful phrases:

**I love you**  
**I’m sorry**  
**Please forgive me**  
**Thank you**

What surprised me the most is how different my energy feels when I combine this practice with **blue solar water** — water stored in a blue bottle and left under sunlight for a short period.

To my own experience:  
✨ The water tastes *cleaner, fresher, and softer*  
✨ I naturally drink more water (at least 2 liters a day now!)  
✨ It makes cooking and even my morning coffee feel lighter  
✨ Drinking becomes a mindful moment instead of a routine  
✨ I feel calmer, clearer, and more connected to myself

I don’t see this as something mystical.  
To me, it’s a gentle reminder of how **intention can shift the energy we carry**, and how even something as simple as water can become healing when we approach it with gratitude.

The blue bottle symbolizes cleansing.  
The sunlight brings warmth and renewal.  
The words bring us back home to ourselves.

I’m not sharing this to convince anyone — just hoping that someone who needs a little softness today might find comfort in this practice too.

If anyone here also practices blue solar water or Ho’oponopono, I’d love to hear your experience.",1,1764226265.0,Hooponopono_Morrnah,0,1.0,False

She then came and was commenting on the contents of random food stuff in my fridge. I realised later on that day that she must have found my pens. She is judgemental about people taking mounjaro due to ""diabetics not having easy access to it as people are using it for weight loss"", also due to some of the side effects (we work in healthcare and have seen some stuff). She, herself has said how she struggles to lose weight with just diet and exercise alone and how her doctor doesn't care when she expresses this.

I have insulin resistance, metabolic disorder and have been clinically overweight since my early 20's and later clinically obese. Food noise was constant and I felt out of control. This drug isn't magic, you don't just take it and lose weight and I don't understand why that is so hard for people to understand. You have to eat right and exercise for it to have an effect, well in my case anyway. The drug has fixed my biological markers that made diet and exercise redundant for me before and also without the food noise I can now listen to and feel my hunger cues like a ""normal person"" and the realisation that not everyone had these obsessive thoughts about food like me has also been eye opening. Just because I don't have diabetes I don't know why I should be judged. I have other health conditions that the drug corrects and I can finally lose weight. What is wrong with that? 

So yes, I do not tell people I'm on it because people are horrifically judgemental but I do tell people the benefits of the drug for people with metabolic disorders, PCOS, insulin resistance etc.

I've found the posts and community here extremely helpful so I wanted to share my experience of my first month in case it's helpful to anyone newbies or lurkers who are considering starting. tl;dr Just start! 

About me: 

* 39/F
* Height: 5'6""
* First dose: 10/26/2025
* Starting weight: 275lbs
* Current weight: 266lbs (-9lbs)
* Current dose: 2.5mg
* Pen or vials? Vials
* Injection site: Stomach
* Self-pay or insurance? Self-pay through LillyDirect
* Other diagnoses? Low thyroid, but all other labs normal
* Alcohol use? None, I was sober before I started taking Zep.

**Why did I start taking Zepbound?**

* I was tired of gaining weight despite being active and eating well, and I knew that calorie restriction/excessive exercise would NOT work for me.
* I'm tired of being in a larger body that doesn't fit into clothes I want to wear, movie theater/airplane seats, etc.
* I was intrigued and humbled by the positive news stories about the wide-reaching health effects of this drug, from tamping down cravings for drug and alcohol to alleviating long COVID symptoms. 
* I read as many news stories about studies as I could and realized that GLP-1s do a LOT more than just suppress appetite. These are complex drugs that resolve metabolic dysfunction and tell your body it's okay to burn (not just desperately cling to) excess fat.
* I have many friends who use hormones to meet their health goals. I thought, if they can take hormones, why can't I?
* This sub! Your success stories and the positivity in this community really inspired me.

**Which apps have been most helpful?**

* MyFitnessPal for making sure I eat enough and get enough fiber/protein
* Shotsy for tracking shots
* HappyScale for tracking daily weigh-ins

**Any side effects?**

* I got the ""Zep flu"" the day after my first shot. Extremely fatigued, inflamed lymph nodes that were swollen to the touch, and nausea. This resolved within 24 hours and hasn't happened since. 
* Heartburn and diarrhea when I eat high-fat foods like cheese and guacamole. 
* Occasional nausea and lightheadedness.
* Incredibly vivid dreams.
* So. Much. Peeing.

**Any foods I can't/don't eat?**

Before Zep, I was a coffee-drinking chocolate fiend who drank an eight-pack of sparkling water every week. But in the last month, I have no cravings for:

* Coffee
* Sparkling water
* Sweets/candy
* Pasta
* Pizza

I've had a pint of Haagen Dasz ice cream in the fridge for a month and I can't finish it. Bizarre!!!

**What's in my weekly grocery cart?**

* Carbs: High-fiber bread, tortillas, potatoes
* Proteins: Chicken breasts, sliced turkey, ground turkey, cooked salmon, tuna in a pouch
* Dairy: Siggis yogurt, Fairlife milk, Fairlife protein shakes
* Produce: Leafy greens, apples, bananas, citrus, berries
* Frozen: Frozen blueberries, frozen mango, frozen salmon or turkey burgers
* Pantry: Chia seeds, popcorn, fruit snacks/fruit leathers, roasted salted pumpkin seeds, trail mix, granola, high fiber cereal

**Advice for needle-phobes**

I have a big fear of needles and was totally convinced that I couldn't self-inject, but I can and you can do it, too. 

Things that helped me with needlephobia: 

* Working with my therapist to discuss my fears/anxieties.
* Take my shot at night after dinner so I can just relax and go to sleep after. 
* Put something soothing/silly on the TV in the background (I like *What We Do in the Shadows*). 
* Have a friend come over and watch me do the injection. 

**What's next?**

I have to take a pause for the next six weeks for surgery, but I'm excited to start back up again in the New Year. Here's to a wonderful 2026 for all of us!",4,1764225803.0,Zepbound,1,0.84,False

I've self-pubbed two books and have serialized two others. I would love some feedback on my cover letter blurb

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

  
Dear \[Agent name\]  
  
Who could love Jenna Carvel's black soul? Certainly not Frank ""Kurt"" Coleman. After she bullies him throughout the 90s, Kurt couldn't care less when she has a mental breakdown in first-period history. The only thing on his mind is graduating and getting out of Orlando to chase after Erica, his first love. 

But when Jenna comes back, she's transformed. Gone are the dress-code-skirting outfits, her partying stops, and those sneers are now sweet smiles. Kurt had always been drawn to her outer beauty, but what is he supposed to do when her inner beauty starts to match? How can he even consider someone who caused him so much pain?

Jenna's life plays out worse than Kurt ever imagined: kicked out of her house at 18, her life spirals into addiction and abuse. Kurt is the last person she ever suspected would save her, but he is the only person who does. Jenna would do anything to pay him back for the two years of peace that he gives her to reconcile her life.

Expecting death, Jenna wakes up in 1997—once again 17—and has a breakdown in class. Refusing to follow the same fate, Jenna first mends the shattered relationship with her mother before setting out to give Kurt a life of happiness by stopping him from making the wrong choice of chasing after a woman who will never love him. If she just so happens to replace that woman in his heart, that's more than fine with her, as he's the only person she could ever love.

*Grunged* is an Upmarket Romance complete at 82,000 words. It will appeal to fans of Emma Scott's *Falling Like Stars* and Toshikazu Kawaguchi’s *Before the Coffee Gets Cold*.

1p7vc9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1p7vc9d/how_i_finally_learned_to_actually_focus_while/,How I Finally Learned to Actually Focus While Studying (Without Losing My Mind),"Okay, real talk. I used to be *terrible* at studying.

I'd sit down with my books, fully motivated, maybe even had a coffee ready… and then two hours later I'd realize I'd been staring at the same page while scrolling through my phone. Sound familiar?

It took me way too long to figure out that the problem wasn't me being lazy or dumb. I just had no clue how to actually *focus*. So here's what changed everything for me - no BS, just stuff that genuinely worked.

# The 25-Minute Trick That Saved My GPA

I stumbled across this thing called the Pomodoro Technique during finals week when I was desperately Googling ""how to not fail everything.""

Here's the deal: you study for 25 minutes like, *really* study, no cheating, then take a 5-minute break. That's it. Do this 3 or 4 times and suddenly you've gotten more done than those marathon 3-hour sessions where you're half-asleep by the end.

The first time I tried it, I was skeptical. Twenty-five minutes felt weirdly short. But something about knowing there's a break coming made my brain actually cooperate. It's like tricking yourself into focusing, and honestly? It works.

# Your Messy Desk Is Sabotaging You (Sorry)

I know, I know—this sounds like something your mom would say. But hear me out.

I used to have papers everywhere, random pens, old coffee cups, textbooks I wasn't even using. And every time I sat down, my eyes would just... wander. To the mess. To that random receipt. To literally anything except my notes.

One day I cleared everything off my desk—took like 5 minutes—and the difference was instant. My brain felt less crowded. I could actually think. It sounds simple because it *is* simple, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work.

# Stop Drowning Yourself in To-Do Lists

This was a game-changer for me. I used to write these massive to-do lists with like 15 things on them, thinking I was being productive. Instead, I'd just feel overwhelmed before I even started.

Now? Three tasks. That's the rule.

Pick the three most important things you need to get done that day, and focus on those first. When you finish them, the feeling is incredible. You actually feel like you accomplished something instead of being stressed about the 12 things you *didn't* do.

Some days I only finish two. That's fine. Progress beats perfection every single time.

# Your Phone Is Not Your Friend Right Now

This one hurt to admit, but my phone was destroying my focus and I didn't even realize it.

Even when I wasn't actively using it, just having it *there* on my desk was enough. I'd see it light up, or I'd think ""maybe I should just check if anyone texted,"" and boom—10 minutes gone.

Now I put it in another room. Flight mode if I need an alarm. It felt weird at first, almost uncomfortable. But within a few days, I realized how much clearer my head was without that constant pull to check notifications.

We seriously underestimate how much our phones mess with our concentration.

# Study Like You're Building Something, Not Cramming

This is the one that actually made studying feel less painful.

I used to try to learn everything all at once—read it, understand it, memorize it, all in one go. My brain would just shut down from overload.

Then I started breaking it into layers:

* First pass: just read through, get the general idea
* Second pass: actually try to understand what's going on
* Third pass: practice problems, test myself, make it stick

It sounds like more work, but it's actually way less stressful. Your brain stays calm because you're not trying to do everything at once. And the crazy part? You actually remember stuff this way.

  


Look, none of this is revolutionary. There's no secret hack or magic formula. It's just about working *with* your brain instead of against it.

Some days will still be hard. Some days you'll still get distracted. That's normal—you're human. But these five things genuinely changed how I study, and more importantly, they made it feel less like torture.

Try one or two of these this week and see what happens. You might surprise yourself.

Think it would surprise the shop stall that 1 lt cans are available and screws come in 5mm increments too, unlike where I come from they try and have ex trade’s on the shop floor helping customers.

Got 3 jobs out of the way now, next is to Finnish off walk in robe, feeling lazy today decided to just tidy up some, will bring the washing machine and kitchen table and chairs tomorrow which been stored in my condo for nearly 5 months now, meanwhile service guy for Toto shower mixer gave us the news that the shower mixer has been connected incorrectly so I will be doing some jack hammering later next week, and no no chance I’m going to let the builder do it, was pleasantly surprised when I fitted in the washing machine tap this morning that water came out if it.

I took the view early on that I would not spend much on tools, that was before I decided to tool up for this new house, I stuck to my guns and shopped on price, at the end of the day there cheap enough to throw away and replace if one breaks down, that track saw wish I had one years ago back in AU when I was still keen to do everything myself, it works very well, the compound mitre saw would annoy me if I used it daily it’s got a few bugs that slow you down if you want to tilt or rebate, but it was cheap, the nail gun, electric, shoots 35mm into soft wood after that it’s hit and miss, I didn’t want a compressor though I know it would have got the job done much better, that cheap copy planer, feels like the makita 190b, happy with it.

And it’s bread making day, first bake at the new place, we will stay over the weekend again, I do the dough then refrigerate for several days but at least 30 hrs but this time will bake Sunday, 1to 3 day slow proof increases flavor, blend two flours together, depending if I want a lighter bread, for rolls I do.

I got into bread baking cause I tired of the bread I was getting here in Pattaya, like some of its ok, I’ve tried baking soughdoug it comes out fine, the miss prefers yeast bread so that’s what I mainly do, really once you start you won’t go back to store brought bread, learned to make yogurt too it’s pretty simple and since my partner was chomping through 1 lt of Australian imported yogart a week decided to see if I could make it, I like it thick Greek style where she likes it runny, but I make it and I win.

1p7v2ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1p7v2ue/types_of_tablet_stand_which_one_matches_my_needs/,Types of tablet stand: which one matches my needs?,"Finding the right tablet stand can make a huge difference in how you use your device every day. Whether you're watching videos, reading recipes in the kitchen, or joining video calls, having your tablet at the right angle matters more than you might think.

**Desktop Tablet Stands**

These are the most common types you'll see. They sit on your desk or table and hold your tablet upright. Desktop stands usually have adjustable angles so you can tilt your screen to reduce glare or find a comfortable viewing position. They're perfect if you use your tablet in one spot most of the time, like at a home office or kitchen counter.

**Floor Tablet Stands**

If you like using your tablet while sitting on the couch or lying in bed, floor stands might be your best option. These come with a long adjustable arm and a base that slides under furniture. You can position your tablet right where you need it without holding it or propping it against pillows. They work great for marathon streaming sessions or video chatting with family.

**Gooseneck Tablet Stands**

These flexible holders attach to surfaces using clamps or mounts. The bendy neck lets you position your tablet at almost any angle or height. People love these for kitchen use since you can mount them to cabinet edges and move them out of the way when cooking. They're also popular for bedside use.

**Portable Tablet Stands**

Small and lightweight, portable stands fold up and fit in bags easily. They're not as sturdy as desktop models, but they're convenient for travel or moving between rooms. If you take your tablet to coffee shops or use it in different places around your home, a portable option makes sense.

**Tablet Stand with Keyboard Support**

Some tablet stands come designed to hold both your device and a keyboard. These turn your tablet into something closer to a laptop setup. If you type a lot on your tablet for work or school, this style gives you better ergonomics than hunching over a flat surface.

**What to Think About Before Buying**

The right tablet holder depends on how you actually use your device. Think about where you spend most of your screen time. Do you need something adjustable? Will you move it around a lot? What's your tablet size and weight?

Also consider stability. Cheaper stands might wobble or tip over, especially with larger tablets. Look for options with non-slip pads or weighted bases if stability concerns you.

You can check out different options and find what works for your setup [here](https://athomewave.com/tablet-stand). Reading reviews from other buyers helps you understand which features actually matter in daily use.

**Making Your Decision**

You don't need to overthink this. Match the stand type to where and how you use your tablet most often. A simple desktop stand works fine if you mainly watch videos at your desk. Floor stands make sense for couch users. Gooseneck models give maximum flexibility in the kitchen or bedroom.

The good news is that tablet stands aren't expensive, so trying one out won't break your budget. You can browse through various tablet stand options [at this link](https://athomewave.com/tablet-stand) to see what catches your eye and fits your needs.

Once you get the right stand, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it. Your neck will thank you, and you'll actually enjoy using your tablet more when it's positioned properly.",1,1764224774.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

Both are great for relaxing outdoors, but they work differently depending on what you need.

**Space and Setup**

A hammock with stand wins if you want flexibility. You can move it around your yard, patio, or deck whenever you want. No drilling into anything. No permanent setup. Just place it where you feel like chilling that day.

Porch swings need a solid overhead structure. You'll need strong beams or a pergola to hang them safely. If you're renting or don't want to drill holes, this could be a dealbreaker.

**Comfort Level**

Porch swings give you that classic sitting position. Great for reading, having coffee, or chatting with someone. You sit upright with back support.

Hammocks let you stretch out completely. You can lay flat, curl up, or even take a nap. The gentle swaying motion helps you relax faster. If you're looking for maximum chill mode, hammocks usually win here.

**Who Can Use It**

Porch swings work better for groups. Two or three people can sit together comfortably. Perfect for families or hanging out with friends.

Most hammocks with stands are built for one or two people max. They're more of a solo relaxation spot, though some bigger models can handle couples.

**Weather and Durability**

Both options need some weather protection. Porch swings under a covered porch stay protected from rain. Hammocks with stands should be moved inside during storms or covered up. The fabric can wear out faster if left in harsh weather.

**Price Point**

You'll find both options at different price ranges. Generally, basic hammocks with stands start cheaper than quality porch swings. But fancy models of either can get pricey.

**The Bottom Line**

Pick a porch swing if you want a permanent seating area, have the right structure for hanging, and enjoy sitting upright with others.

Go with a [hammock with stand](https://athomewave.com/hammock-with-stand) if you want portability, full-body lounging, and easy setup anywhere in your yard. You can check out different options and styles at this [hammock with stand collection](https://athomewave.com/hammock-with-stand) to see what fits your space and budget.

Both are solid choices for outdoor relaxation. Think about your space, how you like to relax, and whether you want something permanent or movable. That'll point you in the right direction.",1,1764224703.0,AmazonThing,0,1.0,False

The first thing I do every morning now is turn my 7 a.m. alarm back on put on my long ignored running shoes and jog through the streets outside my apartment.

The moment I opened the door and felt the cold air hit my face I woke up without needing any coffee. I suddenly realized that I was not running away from anything. I was returning to myself. I had found my way back.

For a long time I let emotions push me around. When I felt wronged I bought sweets. When I felt tired I drank. When I could not sleep I stayed up late watching dramas and scrolling through novels just so the loneliness floating around my life would not feel so loud. But after the breakup I became surprisingly quiet inside. I did not feel like my world fell apart and I did not think I had failed. For the first time I understood clearly that I needed to take responsibility for myself with gentleness and stability.

So I started eating again with intention as if I were taking care of a child who needed consistent nourishment. I ate on time ate clean and chose food that made my body feel at ease. I stopped using sugar as a reward and stopped using alcohol as a sedative. I let my body return to neutral and stopped letting my heart be dragged around by every wave.

I also stopped staying up late with shows and novels. I knew the excitement they gave me was only a quick distraction and could never fill the emptiness underneath. So I began turning off the lights earlier allowing each day to start from a truly rested morning. These changes sound small but they were things I could never manage to do before.

At 34 I finally understand something simple yet incredibly hard to practice.

Elaine was sixteen years old and had a summer job at a Pittsburgh shopping mall to help save money for college.   She was on break, looking at a window display, when he approached her from behind.

When she turned around, he said, “My name is Randy,” and shook her hand.  He had an easy, disarming manner.  A professional-looking camera was hanging around his neck.  “I work for the Rising Star Modeling Agency.”   He gave Elaine a business card.  “We’re doing scouting for new models right now.  You’ve got a fresh look.  You should drop by our office.”

When she got off work, Elaine took the bus straight downtown to the Rising Star Modeling Agency.   There were dozens of beautiful young girls walking in and out of the sleek offices, which were on the third floor of a fancy office building.  The walls were covered with posters of glamorous looking models in designer clothing.  She didn’t recognize any of them, but she was sure they were top fashion models.

A chain-smoking, middle-aged woman named Ms. Crawford interviewed her.  She studied Elaine’s face, asked Elaine to turn around.

Elaine was tall, almost five-foot-ten, and had her mother’s figure—modest breasts, a flat stomach, and long, slim legs.

“I think you have a lot of potential.  Do you have a comp card?”

“A what?” Elaine said.

The woman sighed as if she were dealing with a total amateur.  “A comp card is a piece of paper that has your photos with different poses and tells potential clients all about you—your height, weight, dress size, shoe size.  Like this.”  She showed Elaine one.  “No agency will hire you as a model until you have a comp card.”

Elaine blushed, embarrassed by her own naïvety.  “How do I get a comp card?”

“You start by getting some top quality photos.  You can use whatever photographer you want, but I can only recommend Randy.  A comp card costs two hundred dollars.”

“Two hundred dollars!” Elaine gasped.  It was a small fortune to her.

Ms. Crawford sighed.  “Look, honey, do you want to be a model or not?”



\* \* \*

Elaine emptied her bank account and paid the two hundred dollars.  Posing in different outfits under the bright lights and with all the colorful props was thrilling.  Elaine felt a heady rush when she picked up the comp cards.  She looked spectacular in all the different photos.  Now she was a real model!

She gave the cards to Ms. Crawford and went home, waiting for the phone to ring.



\* \* \*

Ms. Crawford did not call.  Two days passed, then a week, then ten days.  

Elaine finally decided to go talk to Ms. Crawford and see what was wrong.   

When she reached the agency, Ms. Crawford  was standing next to the open window, smoking, talking on the phone.  She seemed to talk forever.  Finally, she hung up and looked at Elaine.  “Yes, dear?”

“I...I was wondering if there were any modeling jobs for me yet.”

“And you are...?”

“Elaine Brogan.  I left my comp cards with you almost two weeks ago.”

“Oh.  Yeah.  I thought you looked familiar. You’re B list, right?”

“B List...?”  Elaine didn’t know what she was talking about.

She went over to a file cabinet.  “Let’s see... Bailey, Bennington, Bernstein...Brogan.”  She pulled out Elaine’s file, glanced at the stack of comp cards, then put it back and shut the drawer.  “Everything is in order.  Is there anything else?”

“What does ‘B List’ mean?”

“Means you’re untrained.  You’re not client-ready.  Modeling is a highly competitive field, honey.”  She blew out smoke, looking at Elaine.  “It’s tough to get work unless you’re client-ready.”

“How do I become client-ready?”

“Training of course.”  She handed Elaine a color brochure that showed all the different classes the agency offered.  When she saw the price for the whole program, her eyes bugged out.  “Two thousand dol—”

“Do you think you could be a successful doctor without any training?”

“Well I—”

“A successful lawyer?”

Elaine didn’t speak.

“A successful engineer?  Honey, modeling is no different than any other profession.”

Elaine felt stupid again.  

She left with the brochure.



\* \* \*

“Two *thousand* dollars?” Elaine’s father said, staring at the paper.

“Modeling is no different than any other profession, Dad.  If you want to be a successful doctor, you have to have training.  If you want to be a successful lawyer, you—”

“I know all that.  But two thousand dollars...”

“You don’t think I’m pretty enough to be a model?”

“Of course you’re pretty enough.”

“Then what is it?”

“It’s just that...I was hopin’ you’d choose a profession where you’d use your brains.”

“It’s only a hobby, Dad.  I don’t expect to do it as a *career* or anything.”  The truth was, Elaine had fantasies about being a supermodel and having her picture splashed all over the cover of *Vogue* and flying all over the world and being filthy rich.  She wasn’t keen on the idea of going to college.

Patrick scratched his head, looking at the brochure.  “I don’t know...seems like this could be a scam to lure a lot of gullible young girls—”

“It’s not a scam!  Why do you always have to be so suspicious?”

“Lainie...”  Patrick sighed.  He gazed into his daughter’s big blue eyes.   He couldn’t say no to her.  “Is this really that important to you?”

“Yes,” she said emphatically.

When he finally agreed, Elaine threw her arms around him and kissed his cheek.  “I’ve got the best father in the whole wide world!”



\* \* \*

For Elaine, the rest of the summer was an exhilarating blur of activity.  She took classes on how to walk the ramp and catwalk, on hair and skin care, on fitness and diet, and on positive mental attitude.  She attended seminars covering what to do in the “green room” and backstage, how to create good portfolio poses, and the use of body language.   Outside of the agency, she also signed up for aerobics classes to burn off extra fat.

Her father brought home a ten-foot length of wood and sanded it down so she could practice “walking the beam,” for catwalk training.  He installed a huge mirror on her bedroom wall to help her refine movements and improve her posture.

Elaine slowly transformed from the proverbial ugly duckling into a swan.  She didn’t consider herself naturally beautiful, but she learned to make the best use of everything she had.  She learned to buy clothes that accentuated her long legs and downplayed her small bust, and to do it on a budget that created a classy impression.    She learned to smile more often, and to hold her head high when she was afraid.  In general, she became much more aware of her posture and facial expressions and learned to move with much more grace and finesse.   

Elaine worked hard, day and night, anxious to complete all the courses as quickly as possible, so she could get her career off to a roaring start.

In mid-August, she finished the last class offered by the agency, *Acting in TV Commercials*. She excitedly took the certificate down the hall to Ms. Crawford.  

“All done,” Elaine said.

“All done with what?”  

“With the acting class,” Elaine said, proudly holding up the signed certificate.  “I’ve completed the entire program now.”

“Congratulations,” Ms. Crawford muttered. With her cigarette dangling from her mouth, she took the paper and turned to the file cabinets.  “What’s your name again, honey?”

Elaine gritted her teeth.  “*Brogan*.  Elaine Brogan.”

She pulled Elaine’s file out, dropped the certificate in with all the others, and shut the drawer.

“We’ll call you.”



\* \* \*

Two long weeks passed.   School started.  Elaine heard nothing from the agency.  She had expected the phone to start ringing off the wall for auditions.  But every night when she got home, there were no messages on the answering machine. 

She finally took the bus downtown to the agency and went straight to Ms. Crawford’s office.  The woman was on the phone, as usual.  Elaine impatiently tapped her fingers on the counter until she hung up.

“Can I help you?”  Ms. Crawford said, lighting up a cigarette from the fire of the previous one.

“Yes.”  Elaine mustered up her courage.  “I want to know why you’re not calling me for any jobs.  I’ve completed the entire training program, and—”

“What’s your name, dear?”

Elaine couldn’t believe it.  “Brogan!” she snapped.  “*Elaine* Brogan!”

“Don’t get snippy with me, honey.  We have hundreds of girls at this agency.”

“I’m sorry...I’m just a little upset.  You told me that when I finished the training classes, I would be able to get modeling jobs.”

“I told you no such thing.”

Elaine blinked once.  “You said that to be client-ready, I had to have training.”

“That’s right.”

“Well?  I’ve taken every training class you offer.”

“Yes, that’s right.  You’ve done all the group training.  To be client-ready, you also need individual training, one-on-one, with Mr. Eskew.”

Elaine fought the anger that was growing inside her.  “And how much does that cost?  Another two thousand dollars?”

“My, you’re the jaded one, aren’t you, missy?  It so happens that personal training with Mr. Eskew is free.”

Elaine was taken aback.  “Free?”

“You have to be personally selected by Mr. Eskew.”

“Oh.  And how does that work?”

“By asking for an interview.  Would you like me to schedule one for you?”

“Yes, of course.”  She added, “Please.”

Ms. Crawford went to a desk calendar and opened it.  “Let’s see...Mr. Eskew has an open slot three weeks from—”

“I want an interview *now*.  I don’t want to wait three weeks.”

Ms. Crawford stared.  Elaine’s heart was beating hard with anxiety, but she intended to hold her ground.  She wasn’t going to let herself be pushed around anymore.

The woman ran her pencil down the calendar.  “There has been a cancelation for six-thirty tomorrow night—would that suit you?”

“That’s perfect,” Elaine said.  

Elaine turned to leave, then looked back.  “Thank you.”

Ms. Crawford blew smoke out of the side of her mouth.  “The pleasure was all mine.”



\* \* \*

Ronald Eskew, the owner of the agency, was a handsome man.  In his forties, he had a swarthy complexion, long sideburns, and a droopy mustache.  He was always immaculately dressed.  The only time Elaine ever glimpsed him was on the elevator or passing through the hall to his office.  He was always with a beautiful young girl or two, who were decked out in expensive designer outfits. 

For her interview, Elaine wore what she thought was her best outfit, a pair of skintight white jeans that showed off her long legs, and a top that revealed her flat stomach.  She spent her last three weeks’ pay to have her hair styled and splurged on a professional makeup job, even though she could have done it herself now.

She took the bus to the agency.  For some reason, she did not want her father to know what she was doing, so she told him she had to work at the mall.  The weather could not have been worse.  It was pouring down with rain, the wind blustery.  Even with her umbrella she was wet from the knees down when she arrived at Rising Star.  

Ms. Crawford let her right in—she didn’t have to wait.

“Well, Ms. Brogan, it’s a pleasure to meet you,” Mr. Eskew said.  “Please have a seat.”

She sat down on his leather couch.  His office smelled of cigar smoke and musky aftershave lotion.   He closed the door, then pulled up a chair and turned it backwards, sitting directly across from her.  He was so close their knees were almost touching.    He wore a lot of gold jewelry.  She noticed that he had a Rolex watch.

Taking her comp card from her sweaty hand, he glanced at the front, then the back, then looked her up and down, pausing to admire her figure.  His gaze rested on her bare stomach.  “You have a fresh look.  There’s a certain innocence about you that’s appealing.”

“Thank you.”

He set the comp card down on the coffee table, then looked into her eyes.  “I know I don’t have to tell you how competitive the modeling profession is, Ellen.”

“It’s Elaine.”

“Right.  Elaine.  To make it in this business, you have to bring out your true self, your uniqueness.”  He motioned to her.  “You know what I mean?”

Elaine nodded.

“The camera picks up what you’re thinking, what you’re feeling, your...*attitude*.  That’s really what it’s all about.  *Attitude*.”  He moved his hands a lot when he talked.

He glanced back down at her stomach.  It seemed like every time he looked there his droopy mustache gave a little twitch.

“With my personal coaching,” he went on, “I bring out the model’s uniqueness.”  He peered down at her knee, then reached out and put his hand there.  Gazing into her eyes again, he said, “Would you like to receive personal coaching, Elaine?”

“Well...”  She wanted to brush his hand away.  “I’m not sure I—”

“Would you like to go on photo shoots in the Caribbean?  In Paris?  In LA?”

“I—”

“To own expensive clothes?  To have so much money you can buy whatever you want without giving it a second thought?”

His hand slid up her thigh.  Elaine looked down at it, unable to move.  She abruptly rose.

“I don’t like you touching me,” she blurted.  “I’m only sixteen.”

He looked up at her, frowning with disapproval.  “You’re acting like you’re twelve.  Professional models have to be mature.”

For a second, Elaine felt an impulse to repress what she was feeling and try to act more “mature,” but then she realized it was just more manipulation.  Everything was crystal clear to her now. 

“This agency is just a scam,” she said.  “I know what you’re doing.”

“And what is that?” he said, raising an eyebrow.

“I’ve seen those other girls—”

“What other girls?”

“The others...”  Elaine realized that she had no concrete evidence of anything this slimy man did.  “I want my money back.  I spent two thousand dollars here, and I want it back!”

“I’m afraid that’s out of the question.”

“Really?  Then I think I’ll go to the police and tell them what you just did to me.”

“And what was that?” he said, raising his eyebrow again.

“You...”  She realized she had very little to say*.  He touched my knee.*

“Yes?” he said.

“I’ll—I’ll tell my *father* what you did.  He’s six-three and weighs two hundred and fifty pounds.  He’s a construction worker.”

Mr. Eskew’s dark complexion lost a little of its color.  He watched her for a few seconds.

“There’s no reason to make threats,” he said, cordially.  “At Rising Star, we guarantee satisfaction.”  He stepped behind his desk and crouched to one of the cabinets. She heard clicking.  It sounded like he was opening a safe.

“Two thousand dollars, you said?”

“That’s right.”  Elaine was sure this was some kind of trick.  She couldn’t believe he would actually refund her money.

He shut the safe and placed two bundles of one hundred dollar bills on the desk, then pushed them towards her.  

She stared at them.

“Go ahead.  Take it.”

She picked them up before he could change his mind, putting both bundles in her purse.

“I hope you see now that we are a reputable agency, and that you will tell others so.  Just because your personal expectations weren’t met, it doesn’t mean the same will hold true for other girls.”



\* \* \*

When Elaine reached the lobby, she saw that it was still pouring with rain outside, and then realized that she had left her umbrella in Mr. Eskew’s office.  She wasn’t about to go back and get it.  

She flew out the door and dashed down to the bus stop.  By the time she reached the shelter, she was soaked to the skin.  But she was grinning ear to ear.

She had gotten all the money back!  Every last dollar!

Her father would be proud of her.  He had been right all along.  He would have the satisfaction of saying “I told you so,” but at least she got the money back. 

As she waited for the bus, she began to worry.   Something was bothering her.  It felt too easy.  She glanced up and down the rainy street.  What if Mr. Eskew called some thug to intercept her and steal the money back?

Making sure no one was watching, she took the bundles from her purse and slid them into the front pockets of her jeans.  

The bus soon arrived.  Elaine took a seat in the back and worried all the way home, glancing out the rear window every so often, afraid someone might be following along in a car.

When she reached her stop, she asked the driver to wait for a second while she stepped out and checked the road behind the bus, but no car was following.

She quickly made her way home.  She didn’t live in the kind of neighborhood where it was safe to carry more than ten dollars around in your purse.  But then, nobody expected her to have any money, and everyone on her block was terrified of Patrick Brogan.

Elaine found her father in his usual position, sitting in front of the TV set, a beer in his hand.   

“How was your day, sweetheart?”   He looked more closely at her.  “You’re soaked, Lainie!    You better change clothes.”

Elaine pulled the two damp bundles from her pockets and deposited them on the coffee table in front of him.

“What’s this?” he said, sitting up. 

“All the money we spent at Rising Star, Dad.  Every penny.”  She leaned over and put her arms around his neck and kissed him.  “You were right.”

“About what?”

“It’s a scam.  All they do is...well, I’d rather not say.  The point is, I got the money back.”

Her father looked at the two stacks of bills in amazement.  

“I want you to put it in the bank, for college,” she said.

Patrick gazed at his daughter with admiration in his eyes.  “You’ve grown up, honey, you know that?”



\* \* \*

In her bedroom, when Elaine took off her wet jeans, she shuddered, remembering Mr. Eskew putting his hand on her leg.  Then she noticed that there were two grayish stains on the white material over the pockets, where the two bundles of bills had been.

*Even the man’s money is dirty*, she thought, as she put the jeans in the laundry hamper. 

She hoped the stains would come out.



\* \* \*

The following evening, when Elaine and her father were eating dinner, there was a knock at the door.

“I’ll get it,” she said, rising from the table.  She went to the front door and cracked it open, leaving the chain in place. The first thing she saw was the flashing of blue light on the houses across the street.

“Is this the Brogan residence?” a man in a gray suit asked.

“Yes.”

He flashed some kind of badge with a star on it.  “US Secret Service.  Open the door, ma’am.”

Stunned, Elaine unchained the door and pulled it back.  There were not one, but two men in gray suits.  

“Does Patrick Brogan live here?” one said.

“Well...yes.”  She swallowed, having a very bad feeling.  “Dad,” she called, but he was already stepping up behind her.  

“What’s going on?” he said nervously.

“Patrick Brogan?” 

“Yes...”

“Did you deposit some cash this morning at the First National Bank branch over on Penn?”

“Well...yeah, I did, but—”

Handcuffs snapped around his wrists.  “You’re under arrest for passing counterfeit currency.”   

The other man said, “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney...”",1,1764224620.0,u_Ill_Rough214,0,1.0,False

**Part 3** 

John picked up on the strange man like I had. We had talked back and forth, batting around ideas of what to do about the strange man that didn’t belong. We talked to him around the coffee pot and during the questions and answers section, seeing if we could make sense of what he was doing and why he might be there, but any attempt to do so failed.

The man’s way of speaking wasn’t normal. It didn’t flow properly. His articulation, his word choice, the idiomatic expressions he used, while all accurate seemed odd and disjointed. In a still frame you couldn’t tell him apart from anyone else, but in motion he didn’t quite fit.

He’d always come to therapy late with some excuse; his bus ran late, he stepped in a puddle and had to go home and change his socks—excuses that you could except on their own but happened too frequently for them to be true. And with any question you asked him he always had an answer ready for you.

John and I had theories of why he might be there. John joked that he might be a therapist in the room tasked with monitoring our progress, or that he was a homeless man that dressed nice and really liked the coffee.

As time went on, session after session, our curiosity began to build and build until it reached a fever pitch. John and I went to therapy early one day to get one of the nicer chairs with the little red cushion on it to make the hour and a half we spent there more bearable. We decided to confront the man after the meeting. We, of course, had our reservations about confronting a guy who could possibly be going through the same struggles we were going through, but every fiber of my being was telling me that wasn’t the case.

The meeting went well, as well as it did any other day. We see him leave and as we’re walking out into the parking lot, we decide to do it.

John shouted, “Hey!”

The strange man slowly turned around.

John spoke, “What are you doing here? It doesn’t seem like you’re actually here to get better. It seems like you’re doing just fine.”

The man began to list the same problems he said he had during our sessions with him, but John and I were no more convinced than when he had told us the first time.

John continued, “We don’t really think that’s true. It doesn’t seem like you’re trying to fix the problems you say you have. It doesn’t even seem like you take the meetings seriously. What are you even doing here?”

The man chuckled to himself. A subtle smirk spread across his face. “Ok, you’re right. I don’t belong here, but I can’t really tell you why I’m here.”

John and I began to get agitated and surprisingly aggressive in the conversation.

I spoke up, “No. We need to know why you’re here in the meeting. This is our safe space and you’re violating it. It’s not right.”

His attitude shifted from playful to compassionate as he began to speak, “Look, I’m not doing this on purpose. I’m not a bad guy, but what I’m doing is really important. I can’t tell you right here and now, there’s too many people that could hear, but if you meet me here tonight around eleven o’clock, I’ll tell you.”

“We’re not meeting you in the damn parking lot at eleven o’clock at night,” I said.

“Well, if you want to know why I’m really here—if you want to know what’s really going on, then you better be in this parking lot at eleven o’clock. That’s all I can tell you. I’m not going to hurt you. I just have a big secret, and I can’t go around telling everybody.”

“Well, why tell us?” I asked.

He looked me in the eyes and said, “It’s because you noticed.”

It felt like he was complimenting us, like we had stumbled upon something others hadn’t, like we were special. It stroked our egos in just the right kind of way and our curiosity needed to be satisfied, so John and I made our decision.

Like curious little cats, John and I met in the parking lot later that night to meet the strange man that didn’t belong.

10:45, 10:50, 10:55, 11:00… nothing, he was late.

11:05, 11:10, 11:15, and still nothing.

He obviously wasn’t showing up. Can’t say we were too surprised.

Maybe he was bullshitting. Maybe he tricked us. Maybe he’s sitting in the bushes seeing if we looked stupid waiting there that late at night. We spent the time laughing and joking in the empty lot. We played around until about 11:30, when we decided it was a good time to leave.

We headed through the dimly lit parking lot towards our cars that were parked side-by-side at the end of the empty lot. The little light that was present sporadically speckled the area and was quickly enveloped by the vast darkness of the night, seemingly making a barrier around the edges of the property.

As we’re walking forward, just from the darkness, faint silhouettes emerge directly in front of us. Five cloaked individuals standing there seemingly motionless against the darkness, their faces obscured in silhouettes. Their cloaks lay like wet drapery over the hand and foot of each figure. I could start to see them breathing, swaying ever so slightly.

John and I are not amused. We stare for what feels like minutes but were more likely seconds. We glance at each other and share a look for a moment. Without talking, we both started backing up slowly; signaling to the people in front of us that whatever they were up to, we weren’t interested in finding out.

But it was too late to leave. The trap was set and sprung.

As we back up, two of the figures dart into the left and right edges of darkness. They were so unnaturally fast, disappearing in between blinks of an eye. We back up, taking quicker, wider steps. Two more disappeared again into the darkness, leaving only one straight in front of us. We both turned around to run, but there was already one in front of me and another in front of John.

*‘That’s impossible. Are there more than just five?* *They were at least 30 yards away a second ago.’* 

I tried to run away, but whatever direction I took, there was one to block my path. They moved in quick surreal movements, as if gravity were a force unbound for them. They could’ve stopped me from leaving the parking lot, but I knew they were toying with us. While running away John disappeared behind the building, but I can only imagine he was experiencing the same horror I was.

I think back to when I was jumped—the pain, the helplessness I felt that day. I think that maybe I can use momentum against a faster opponent. I swing to hit what would be the jaw of the figure.

What should feel soft and vulnerable feels like coarse steel, like iron clamping down on my hand. It was as if I hit a brick wall. A jolt of pain shot through my arm sending me to the ground. It stood, completely unbothered, looming over me.

I tried in vain to run again as my heart was beating out of my chest. While I was running, a fist moved at that same impossible speed I had seen moments before, clothes lining me to the ground. I felt the air escape my lungs and a loud pop in my lower back as I struggled to breathe. I managed to get a few breaths of air in between coughs. I attempt to roll over and crawl away, when I see John still on his feet trying to fight. He had made his way back closer to me.

The two that were with John were humoring him as they dodged every punch he threw at them. I could see them effortlessly outmaneuver him with every punch thrown. I continued to crawl when I felt a hand grip on my belt pulling me up in the air and flinging me helplessly back onto the ground. I instinctively held out my arms trying to brace for the fall as best as I could. As I fell onto the ground, I let out a scream. My right arm felt like it was splitting in half. Another figure was right beside where I landed and kicked me in the ribs. I rolled onto my stomach coughing up blood on the ground.

It hurt worse than the first time. I knew my wounds were reopening. Writhing in pain, I now see John getting beat just as badly as I was. Once again, I think back to being attacked outside the grocery store. I remember being scared, feeling helpless, feeling weak. I decided not to run. I wasn’t going to cry. I wasn’t going to cower. However hopeless it was, I was going to fight.

I stood back up with my right arm limp from injury, but my left still functional. I charged at one of the figures. They stayed in place, unmoving, untroubledly wanting to see me break my hand again. They expected me to punch, but I wasn’t going to fight fair. I pull my left hand backward to throw a punch. As it launches forward, before making contact, I undo my fist pointing my fingers forward directly at their eyes. They moved, but not until it was too late. I was met with some resistance but managed to pierce through. Blood rushed like tears down their eyes, dripping down at my feet. For the first time, I had done something. I heard a loud deafening scream, but it sounded different. Looking closer I saw flowing brown hair peeking out from the hood of the figure. It was a woman—I had been fighting a woman this entire time.

Before I knew it, I was back on the ground, my left arm broken as well. I couldn’t move. I was helpless once again, getting beat worse than I could’ve ever imagined. John gave up quicker than I did and as a reward he got off a little easier. I knew it was over. I had been lucky the first time, but this time wouldn’t be the same. My will to live had reached its limit. Everything that I was, everything that I could’ve been was gone.

One of the figures moved over to us as three others watched. He pulled down his hood revealing himself to be the strange man; the man that didn’t belong. When I looked at his face, he looked different. He looked less human and more like an animal. I looked at his teeth, and his canines were like that of a large German shepherd. The strange man smiled showing off his new sharp teeth before he spoke.

“Do you want to die?”

I laid there building up the strength to talk.

“No.” I said, “I-I want to live.”

“Do you want to be as strong as I am now?”

I didn’t want to be strong. I just wanted to survive, and I knew John wanted the same.

I said what I thought he wanted me to say. Attempting to sit up, I feebly responded, “Yes.”

John echoed my reply.

After hearing our words, three others behind him removed their hoods as well, revealing different faces and ages. Two men and another woman. Their eyes pointed towards the man without saying a word. Each one was smiling with those same sharp white teeth.

The strange man extended his arms down turning over his palms and spoke again.

“I’ll offer you strength and power. You will never feel helpless again, but for this you owe your undying loyalty to us, your service, and your life if we so choose.”

We both agreed, not that we had much choice. I reached out with my mangled fingers to meet his hands. Before they could meet, he took them away, indicating there was no joining him, no acceptance, no forgiveness, no salvation. It was a lie. My death was the final punchline to a cruel practical joke. I lost the last bit of my strength and fell over as he dove on top of me, sinking his sharp teeth into my neck—his hands wrapped firmly around my shoulders. With my head pushed to my side, I see a woman on top of John biting into his flesh and seeming to really enjoy it.

I was dead. I know I was dead. There was no white light I had to chase, no heaven, no hell. My consciousness slipped into an endless void. A void I couldn’t touch, hear, or see, but knew was there, nonetheless. I was suspended in vast nothingness.

Before too long the void emptied out and took me along with it. I felt a coldness. I heard a hushed echo. I could see a faint light.

1p7uzew,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1p7uzew/video_essay_about_porn_addiction_never_once/,Video essay about porn addiction never once mentions the demonization of male sexuality. Plus my thoughts on the “goonicide” incident.,"You can watch the essay I’m referencing by looking up, “the disturbing world of gooning” on YouTube. It has over 1 million views so it’s not that obscure.

I don’t understand how stuff like this gets so popular. A video essay on porn addiction that never mentions the need to destigmatize male sexuality or addresses why men and boys are pushed towards porn to begin with. Is it perhaps because, unlike women who are taught to be proud of their sexuality, men are stereotyped as predators and told that having sexual needs is disgusting and a thing to be ashamed of and hidden? No? Oh yeah, obviously it’s entirely social media’s fault that children are increasingly developing their sexuality online and in isolation. It really is a chicken before the egg situation, isn’t it? These problems didn’t start with social media and that’s never acknowledged.

What’s even worse is the example used at the beginning: a man is recorded with his pants off in the drive-through of a Hooters-like coffee shop, which is obviously a disgusting, horrible, and unjustifiable action. However, instead of just forwarding the video to the police, the manager decided to post the video online, which resulted in the man getting doxed and him committing suicide. He had a wife and son. What I find ironic about this whole situation is that the same women who make a living profiting off of the sexual repression of men, are angered and disgusted by it when they’re confronted with the inevitable results of their decisions in person. 

I don’t have any problem with sex work and I won’t pretend to know what situations in life led those women to work there, nor will I excuse the disgusting actions of the man in that drive-through. However, when you make a living off of men like this every day, either on social media or in person, I think it’s common human decency to extend a bit of empathy to someone who clearly has a problem, or at least to his family, and think before publicly humiliating him, (a form of mob punishment that has become all too accepted in our society)
