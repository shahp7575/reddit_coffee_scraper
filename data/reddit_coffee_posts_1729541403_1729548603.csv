1g921wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g921wc/i_made_the_mistake_of_hiring_a_psycho_that_stole/,I made the mistake of hiring a psycho that stole my life,"I'm sorry this is really long but bear with me. I (27f) work a desk job at a small insurance company. I am the only one that is in my position and knows how to do my job so taking time off can sometimes be tricky. I typically take vacations that overlap the weekend and holidays so any day I miss off work, I just catch up on when I return. However, about a year ago ago, I wanted to take an international trip that required me to take the entire month off. I wouldn't be able to come back and catch up on what I missed because the work would be piled up and unfinished for an entire month. My boss approved my request under the condition that I temporarily hire someone to cover my desk. This is where everything went down hill.

I posted on LinkedIn that I was looking for a temp to cover my desk and disclosed the pay and that the person hired would be trained for a week prior to my departure. I got a message from a girl, let's call her Laura (28f) that has worked the same position at a notable insurance company in the past, she had a clean resume, graduated from UC Berkley and she was really nice. She mentioned that she left her previous job to pursue something bigger and was currently between jobs. I brought her up to my boss and we decided to hire her.

During the training week, she was very attentive, punctual, professional, and nice. We ended up forming a friendship in that week because we had a lot in common. A couple of days before I left for my trip, I invited her out to drinks with my friends and boyfriend. We had a great time and my friends got along with her really well. I had to leave early to start packing and everyone stayed to continue the hang out. I felt relief knowing that the month I was gone, someone reliable was covering my desk and loved that she was getting along with my friends.

When I got back from my trip, I thanked her for covering for me and we parted ways but wanted to keep in touch. I noticed she cleaned and organized my entire office and there was no work left over. She did an amazing job. My boss and I had a meeting to touch base and catch up on what happened in the month I was gone. He said that Laura did and excellent job and she loved the environment and asked if there were any open positions. Unfortunately, there were no open positions at our company but I texted her and told her I'd keep a look out for any positions that open up.

About a month later, I took some time off to go on a local trip. I was only missing 2 days of work but I texted Laura and asked her if she wanted to cover me just so she can get some money and I wouldn't have to catch up on what I missed. Yet again, when I returned she did an incredible job and apparently made a lunch of meatball sliders for the entire office on one of the days I was gone. I thought it was a little weird that she was going above and beyond but brushed it off cause maybe that's just her style.

A couple of weeks go by and my boss asks to speak to me. He told me that for the past few months, my performance has been low. I will admit that I got comfortable at my job and started slacking off a bit but I always made sure my work was done. He started bringing up issues about my coming in late to work but it didn't matter because the days I came late, I stayed late to get my work done. He also mentioned that my attire was unprofessional which is odd because he's never had a problem with it before. Then my boss started comparing me to Laura and emphasized on how she's on top of everything, professional, punctual, yadda yadda yadda. I knew exactly where this conversation was going. He ended up letting me go and low and behold, who got hired to take my position? LAURA.

It doesn't end there. After I got fired, I focused on trying to find a new job. I tried to see the silver lining and realized that yeah I liked my previous job but it wasn't fulfilling and saw this as an opportunity to find something better. A few days later, my friend, let's call her Emily (26f) messages the group chat and invites us all out to a billiards place to hang out. I felt like I was kind of in a slump the past week so I got excited to go out. However, I show up to the billiards place and guess who's there amongst my friends? LAURA.

I got really agitated that she was there and asked Emily why she was invited. She told me that they had been in touch ever since we all went out for drinks a couple of months ago. At this point no one knew my work situation but I ended up telling Emily that I got fired and she stole my job. Emily brushed off my complaint by telling me that I complained about that job anyways and that maybe it's a good thing. I'm typically an optimist and did realize that it's not Laura's fault.

I pulled Laura aside to just try to clear the air and get some closure. She was very kind and respectful about the entire situation. She told me it was never her intention to take my position and offered to talk to my boss about about her quitting and letting me get my job back. I was really bothered by my boss and how things were handled and so I didn't care about going back. Plus I felt selfish to encourage Laura to quit just so I can have my job back. I decided to let it go and carry on through the night. Again we had a great time the entire night.

The next morning, I noticed that Laura was added to our group chat. I don't know why but it rubbed me the wrong way. My boyfriend (27m), let's call him Steve, slept over that night so when I noticed that she was added to the group chat, I vented to him about my concerns. I told him I felt weird having her in the group chat and so close to my friend group, especially given what happened at my work. He told me that it was just too fresh for me and that I just needed to take some space. So I took some space.

Over the course of a couple of weeks, I saw that Laura was really active in the group chat and making all these plans with my friends. I'd get invited to go out but declined and made an excuse that I was trying to focus on myself. It kind of bothered me that Steve knew how I felt about the situation but he went out with our friends without me. One day, I had a conversation about it with him and told him I'm not comfortable with him always going out with them and being around Laura. It's very unlike me to be this controlling but I was really bothered with the whole situation. Steve and I ended up getting into a big argument about it and he called me jealous. I got really pissed at him and wanted space from him too.

I ended up doing some research on Laura because I felt there was something off about her. During my research I discovered that she never went to UC Berkley, her resume was all fake, and apparently the last place she worked at was a Mexican restaurant and she got FIRED cause she threw food at a customer. She lied about literally everything and had me fooled. Maybe I'm a psycho for going into a deep stalk and calling her previous employer to get all of these details, but I realized that she's the real psycho. I was still pissed at Steve but I had to tell someone and since he's been my boyfriend of 3 years, I wanted to confide in him. So I called him and told him everything.

The conversation we had was a mess. He didn't care to listen to me and kept calling me jealous and making excuses for her. He said she probably didn't disclose all of these details because she felt insecure and just wanted a fresh start. I get his point but it still bothered me that I'm trying to tell him that she's crazy and I don't want to be around her. It seemed like she was constantly in my life and I couldn't get away from her. She was always active in the group chats, hanging out with my friends and it started to feel like my friends were pushing me aside.

One day, I finally decided to go out with my friends with Laura there and I wanted to make a comeback and set boundaries with her. We went to do karaoke at one of those private rooms with the couches and the vibes and she kept trying to steal the show but no one seemed bothered by it. I tried to act unbothered by it since my boyfriend got in my head about me being the crazy one. It was my turn to sing and while I'm singing, I'm noticing Laura took my spot on the couch right next to Steve and she and him were whispering to each other. Something came over me and I just got incredibly jealous. I felt like they were talking about me and I got really angry. So mid song, I stopped singing and yelled at her to get the hell away from my boyfriend.

The vibe changed and I could tell everyone got really uncomfortable. I went off on Laura and called her a psycho and called her out on all of the things I know about her. I'm not the jealous type but this just hit different and brought out an ugly side of me. I felt really embarrassed and rushed out of the room and went outside to get fresh air. Emily came out to comfort me which I thought was really nice and made me feel like someone actually cared about me. I confided in her about how I felt towards Laura and all the information I found out about her. I went on a rant about how she's taking everything from me, but as I kept ranting, I could tell that Emily thought I was crazy. I remember she said ""Laura is really nice and she would never do something evil like that"". She felt like my attack on Laura was unwarranted and that I should of had a private conversation with her instead of airing out her business. I got really ticked off because it just seemed like everything was always about Laura. Emily was still trying to be supportive and see my side but I could just tell that she was just so convinced that Laura was an innocent little angel.

I calmed down and decided to go back inside but when I went back inside, I saw Laura was crying and everyone was comforting her. It was extremely shitty seeing that Steve was comforting her instead of coming out to check on me. Something burned inside of me and then one of my friends told me ""I think you owe her an apology"". I snapped and told them all to screw themselves and left.

Maybe I was wrong for not controlling my emotions but I really don't understand how people can't see what she's doing. A few days went by and I was honestly so burnt out. The group chat was flowing as if nothing ever happened and yet again, it seemed like all the attention in the group chat was always about Laura. I decided to leave the group chat because I couldn't handle it anymore. I didn't want to talk to Steve because I was really upset with him and I just wanted to isolate from everyone. I started to feel really lonely for a few weeks and felt shitty that no one cared to reach out and check on me. Steve checked in here and there but it just felt really dry.

After a few weeks, I messaged Emily and asked her to grab coffee with me. She replied 2 hours later and told me that she already had plans with Laura. I felt like I lost my job, my friends, and my best friend. I decided to sleep over at my boyfriends house that night because I was really lonely even though I was still annoyed with him. It felt comforting being with him but I felt like his mind was elsewhere. We usually talk and cuddle or watch a movie or something but the whole time at his place, we were both just quiet and he seemed really distant and distracted on his phone.

The next morning he got up to shower and my curiosity got to me. He left his phone on the nightstand and in the entire 3 years we've dated, we have never looked through each other's phone because we fully trusted each other. But my gut and curiosity told me to look through his phone. I found messages between him and Laura. There was nothing too provocative but during the last couple of months they've been texting back and forth. She was text him things like ""I'm really sad that your girlfriend doesn't like me"" and stuff like that. And he sent her messages telling her private information about me. He told her that I was diagnosed with anxiety and that's why I lose control. I felt like he completely breached my trust and privacy exposing these personal things to a girl he KNOWS I don't like.

When he got out of the bathroom, I confronted him about it. We got into a huge fight and argued about how it's not okay that he's even texting her behind my back, let alone confronting her and telling her my business. He got mad at me for even going through his phone behind his back. The argument got nowhere and I told him I needed a break. I couldn't be with him in this moment when he hasn't had an ounce of support for me. So we decided to break up.

Later, I found out through a mutual friend that Laura and my friend group would sit there and talk shit about me. Everyone in the group was convinced that I was a psycho jealous person. They think that I'm like this because I'm not the center of attention anymore but I never even thought I was. I am in just utter disbelief that no one sees what I see even though I told them her past and that she's the crazy one. Everyone cut off contact with me. One of my friends even had a birthday get together at his apartment and didn't even invite me. I hated Laura and felt like she ruined my life.

A month later, I see an Instagram story from the bar we typically hang out at and something caught my eye. I replay the story and there's Laura in the background completely rubbing up on Steve!! They literally look like the prodigy power couple! I lost it when I saw this and I get that Steve and I broke up but it's actually insane that she TOOK my boyfriend too!

I know I'm completely wrong for this but I went full rage mode. I went to Laura's place in the middle of the night and smashed her car up. Yeah I'm crazy, but guess what? She is too. I know I was wrong for doing that but I was just so angry and couldn't figure out what else to do. With my luck, she drove a Tesla which is also a really weird red flag because how can she afford a Tesla if her only prior work experience was at a Mexican restaurant?? Anyways, I'm a dumbass and completely forgot that Tesla's record EVERYTHING.

She saw me on the dash cams smashing up her car. Thank god she didn't press any criminal charges (because she's soooooo nice) but she did file a lawsuit. I literally have nothing, I don't have a job, my savings are going down, and I drive a beat up 2006 Honda Accord. And now she's trying to sue me for all of the nothing that I have.

Now we're in the present. I am completely broken. I still don't have a job, I lost my friends, I lost my boyfriend, but most importantly, I lost my sanity. I have been doing somewhat okay though. I started seeing a therapist about a month ago and that's really helping. I finally feel heard but a part of me is paranoid that Laura is somehow going to steal my therapist and turn her against me too. I have been doing a lot of things on my own. I started to go hiking, doing different activities, and using my alone time to reflect and grow. The court date for the lawsuit is in February and I am really nervous for it. I don't care about losing anything anymore but there's a part of me that will forever be haunted by Laura. It's hard for me to get close to anyone and trust anything anymore but I'm hoping, as time goes by, I will heal, my situation will improve, and I'll get a fresh start. I am trying again to be optimistic but now I learned to not be so naive. Thank you all for listening to my rant because I really needed to get this off my chest.",1,1729547872.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1g921w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1g921w7/battle_of_neurodivergences/,battle of neurodivergences,"I 29F recently moved in with two friends 28M and 26NB who I like as people but absolutely despise living with as they are both so messy.

We are all neuro-divergent, and I know this is what contributes to them being forgetful, not being able to clean up, not seeing things in plain site. It does deeply bother me since I have ASD and ADHD, but over the years I have learned to keep things organized a certain way, and do a little cleaning every room I'm in to maintain it.

I have high attention to detail so if the common area or kitchen are messy when I'm trying to do something I will have to stop and clean it in order to focus. I really value having peace and order in my home and am upset that doesn't seem to be possible.

Since moving in I have been a little passive aggressive and bitter sometimes, which is not ideal. We talked and settled on trying to remind other people to clean if something is bothering us. However I see every time they use the kitchen there will be tons of bowls, open food on the counter, used napkins not in the trash, spills, trash out, dishes full of food and water in the sink, food stains. I let my roommate borrow my French press once which was fine, but after using it they left 6 dishes on the counter, plus their ground coffee was spilled all over the counter. I waited a few hours then asked them to clean but they were going out and wanted to do it later so I just ended up cleaning it myself.

It's getting to a pattern where I will deep clean the kitchen when I use it or at the end of the day, and then it's completely trashed again in the morning. I don't think it makes sense to need to remind someone to pick up each individual thing, there would be too many, and also I know they can see the huge mess.

I hate that even when I clean up I am not recognized and appreciated, and the mess comes back immediately. I am worried this will start to cause more serious issues like spoiled food, animals getting in the house, cats being neglected and causing a mess or eating something they shouldnt. At the same time I don't want to keep cleaning up after them like a parent.

The vibes are bad sometimes because I feel like a nag asking for help to clean up their own mess and when I have asked everyone to clean up they seem reluctant. I sometimes say something mean by accident because I'm so upset they don't care they are creating a disgusting and unpleasant situation for me.

I don't want this situation to go nuclear, but I am very upset pretty much every day and not sure what I have control over. Any advice would be appreciated.

PS. Also I know some people will immediately say that because they have ADHD I should understand where they're coming from and tolerate it. I also have ADHD and ASD and other chronic illness I need to manage and constantly cleaning others mess impacts me too. I am not naturally a clean person but I learned to be through trial and error and because I realized I want my life to be neater and I will have to build habits every day to achieve it. I've also realized the value of getting things done sooner rather than later especially since you need to be on it to take care of medical issues.

Biggest and most annoying one is foot and leg swelling. Ughhh it hurts and makes walking and standing unbearable even though I know I should do these things because they‚Äôll probably help. 

The other symptom is randomly fast heartbeat. I went to my psychiatrist the other day and they took my blood pressure 3 times because it was 120 bpm. I‚Äôm usually in the normal range. 

Not sure what‚Äôs causing this. I started T3 in July and began taking both that and my levothyroxine (75mcg for ~2 years now) at night. My only thoughts are it could be my Adderall or morning coffee?

I bought some compression socks online and am waiting to talk to my doctor about this. But does anyone have any tips for reducing the swelling in the meantime?",1,1729547041.0,Hypothyroidism,1,1.0,False

1. A way to seat four people comfortably.
2. A coffee table would be great.
3. A rug would make it classy! We don't have carpet because we have pets.
4. At holidays, a place to put a tree.
5. Somewhere for a TV to go when we're not obsessed about our fireplace or being extraordinarily social and entertaining. When people visit, we want to sit around the fireplace and chat like grown-up adults.
6. A place to put a cat tree (energetic cats that love big windows, and we need to distract them from the fireplace) - preferably one that won't move around because the cats like consistency over challenges

Current problem items/elements that need working with:  
The internet/etc, comes in on the right side wall

I have the following:

1. A couch (82? inches long, fits 3 people) - my gut tells me this couch is too big
2. A chair and a half (40ish inches long, aka 1 person and one average size dog pretending they're a cat)
3. a cat tree (19x24in base)
4. a 60"" tv

I know this space needs appropriately sized things but I need to know what size furniture I'm looking for  
What size couch is good here?  
What size rug?  
Where do they go in the room?

I throw my mercy to you, Reddit; thanks in advance.

He was seated in his favorite corner of the quaint caf√©, a steaming cup of coffee beside him. The rain tapped a gentle rhythm against the windows, creating a cozy, secluded atmosphere. Ethan, smartly dressed and engrossed in his work, barely noticed the world around him.

The doorbell chimed softly as a new customer entered. Ethan glanced up, more out of habit than curiosity, and his gaze settled on the newcomer. She was captivating, to say the least. Her black hair, slightly damp from the rain, clung to her neck and shoulders in delicate tendrils. Her green eyes sparkled with a lively curiosity, and she wore a smile that seemed to light up the room.

She approached the counter and ordered a cappuccino. Ethan found himself unable to look away. There was something enchanting about her, something that pulled him in like a magnet.

She took her cappuccino and looked for a place to sit. She found a seat by the window, the rain providing a picturesque backdrop. Ethan watched as she took a sip of her drink, savoring it with closed eyes.

After finishing her cappuccino, she stood up to leave. In her hurry, she forgot her purse on the table. Ethan noticed it just as she walked out of the door. Without thinking twice, he grabbed the purse and rushed outside to catch up with her. By then, the rain had stopped, leaving the air fresh and cool.

""Eyy!"" he called out, hoping to get her attention. She turned around, her green eyes widening in surprise.

""You forgot your purse,"" Ethan said, handing it to her.

""Oh, thank you so much!"" she exclaimed, clearly relieved. ""There's something very important in here.""

""No problem,"" Ethan replied with a smile. ""I'm Ethan.""

""Isabella,"" she responded, shaking his hand. ""Nice to meet you, Ethan.""

As they stood there, the remnants of the rain glistening on the pavement, both felt that this chance encounter was just the beginning of something special.

At first I thought she was very attractive, but we did not talk much. Over the last month or so, we‚Äôve been talking at almost every event and I have had some one-on-one time with her. I noticed that in group events, where she knows some of my friends and I know some of her friends, she doesn‚Äôt go out of her way to come talk to me, but would be very responsive and conversational when I approach her or say hi. 
I became interested in her and am excited to see her every week we have a common activity or event. Last week, I asked her if she wants to grab coffee after playing soccer, we did, and I walked her to her car. The same day, she texted saying that her friend bailed and can‚Äôt go to some art event they were going to, and asked if I wanted to go with her. We went there together but then her friend caught up with us. 
The day after, I asked her if she wanted to go to the park and chill/ draw, she said yes and we talked for a couple of hours. It was a really good time but we made no plans after. 
I feel like this is developing more into a friendship, but I am really into her. And for context; I have gone out on so many dates over the last year, not a flex or anything, just emphasizing that I normally don‚Äôt get too nervous around girls, and can pick up signs or hints, but with this girl, I do get nervous and can‚Äôt really read her. I actually am really into her. 
I do feel like we have chemistry, and I would be surprised if she didn‚Äôt notice that I am trying to spend time with her (more than what a normal acquaintance/ new friend would). 
I would ask her out for dinner, and i know that that‚Äôs the only way to know, but still, I‚Äôd rather know beforehand if she is looking at this as a friendship or not, because I do want to keep my friendship with the rest of the friend group and not make it awkward (went through that once and it ruined the friendship).

(Last post for the day I promise lol, appreciate the ones that read)","It was late‚Äîtoo late for a good meal, but the rumble in my stomach made the neon glow of the diner unavoidable. I pulled my rig into the gravel lot, the headlights slicing through the darkness, illuminating the flickering sign: ‚ÄúEvelyn‚Äôs Eats: Open 24 Hours.‚Äù

The moment I stepped inside, I was hit by the warm smell of coffee and something sweet. The diner was a relic from another time, with red vinyl booths and a jukebox playing soft country tunes. A few patrons were scattered about, their faces obscured in shadow, but their eyes seemed to follow me as I walked to the counter.

Evelyn herself was behind the register, an older woman with a warm smile, her silver hair tied back in a bun. ‚ÄúWhat can I get you, hon?‚Äù she asked, her voice syrupy sweet.

‚ÄúJust a coffee and whatever you recommend,‚Äù I replied, taking a seat at the counter.

As she poured my coffee, I glanced at the other customers. A couple sat in a booth, their hands clasped, but their eyes were distant, like they were lost in a memory. A man in the corner was hunched over his plate, his face partially hidden by the brim of his hat. I could hear the clinking of cutlery, but no one spoke.

When my food arrived, it was a strange concoction‚Äîpancakes, bacon, and a side of something green that looked suspiciously like‚Ä¶ leaves? I didn‚Äôt question it; I was too hungry.

‚ÄúDig in!‚Äù Evelyn encouraged, her eyes glinting in a way that made me uneasy. I took a bite, and it was surprisingly good. As I chewed, I noticed something odd about the other patrons. They were all staring at me now, their eyes wide and unblinking.

Suddenly, the man in the corner spoke, his voice gravelly and low. ‚ÄúYou should leave while you can.‚Äù

I froze, fork halfway to my mouth. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúEvelyn don‚Äôt take kindly to strangers,‚Äù he muttered, not looking up from his plate. The couple in the booth nodded slowly, their hands still clasped tightly.

I chuckled nervously, trying to brush it off. ‚ÄúJust passing through. I‚Äôll be out of here in a bit.‚Äù

Evelyn leaned in, her smile never faltering. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find we have a special kind of hospitality here. Best not to stay too long.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine. I looked around the diner again, and the shadows seemed to shift. I caught the couple‚Äôs eyes‚Äîthere was a desperation in their gaze.

I tried to dismiss the tension, convincing myself I was just tired from the road. I finished my food quickly, the unease growing like a gnawing ache. I reached for my wallet, but when I looked up, the diner was empty, save for Evelyn and the man in the corner.

‚ÄúWhere did everyone go?‚Äù I asked, my voice unsteady.

‚ÄúThey left,‚Äù Evelyn said, her tone as sweet as ever. ‚ÄúThey were just here for a bite. You‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre here for something more.‚Äù

The man lifted his head, revealing a face that was ashen and gaunt, eyes sunken deep into his skull. ‚ÄúGet out, man. Now!‚Äù

I dropped my wallet and bolted for the door, my heart pounding in my chest. As I reached for the handle, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun around to see Evelyn standing there, her smile now a twisted grin.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave yet,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt even tasted the special.‚Äù

I shoved past her and burst into the night, the cool air hitting me like a wave. I sprinted to my truck, fumbling with the keys. I could hear Evelyn‚Äôs laughter echoing behind me, shrill and mocking.

As I climbed into the cab, I glanced back at the diner. The neon sign flickered ominously, and for a brief moment, I could see the faces of the other patrons pressed against the windows, their expressions blank and hungry.

I started the engine and tore out of the lot, the gravel crunching beneath the tires. I didn‚Äôt stop until I reached the highway, my heart still racing. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that they were watching me, waiting for my return.

To this day, I avoid that stretch of road. But sometimes, late at night, I can still hear the echo of Evelyn‚Äôs laugh, reminding me that some diners serve more than just food.

* Black seed oil capsules (I just added this like 2 days ago)

She does this every time someone says ‚Äúdrink‚Äù. She does the same thing when someone uses ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù as a catchall - ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get together for coffee and catch up.‚Äù She is not a recovering alcoholic. She is not on the spectrum. 

I just got fed up with the ridiculousness. Every time I have to say I have things other than alcohol, even though it should be very obvious that‚Äôs the case. I‚Äôm tired of explaining it. 

I know my decision to be a bad host was petty, but AITA? 

I may be the AH because I know this about her and could have asked in a different way. But do I really need to?!",22,1729545988.0,AmItheAsshole,32,0.96,False

I'm going through an awful lot right now and I'm not in a good place mentally and physically, I just really need to reconnect with people after everything I've been through. I know maybe it's a utopian expectation to meet decent people here but I'm going all in here. 

as to my hobbies, I like literature, some video games, etymology, social studies in general, cooking and drinks/beverages; not so much mixology but I'm interested in coffee, wine and beers and sometimes pairing them with food. I'm very into music in general, so please don't ask me what genres I like because I cannot answer that. There's barely any that I don't like and I'll even listen to those because this is my hobby as a previously aspiring sound engineer. I also draw and paint a little and am into crafts.

1g9180q,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/1g9180q/manifestation_from_my_experience/,Manifestation‚Ä¶ from my experience,"Some of you can‚Äôt manifest because you are not set up to manifest. And that‚Äôs the most simple truth you‚Äôll ever hear. 

Your current iOS was designed by the toddler version of you and it‚Äôs trying to run complex apps like abundance and fulfilling love. Shan‚Äôt happen‚Ä¶ EVER!

I have been in the manifestation game for like 20 years‚Ä¶ from Seth Robert days to Thomas Troward to Vadim Zeland to Goddard to Maurice nicoll to Jerry and Esther etc.

‚Ä¶ yet I was a bonafide bum through about 17-18 of those years. Did all these things that everyone talks about on these pages. Zilch, I was worse than the National average. Sometimes didn‚Äôt even have ¬£5 to my name.. in my 30s.

So if you haven‚Äôt got a history of manifesting things, it‚Äôs a sign that you‚Äôve encoded limiting beliefs in there somewhere. That means these superficial tricks will not work for you... you‚Äôre not set up for what you so painfully desire.

The only thing that will work in that case is giving yourself permission to feel worthy of what you desire. 

**Ask yourself this and be honest**: by my own valuation, what do I believe is the core attribute for the desire you want? What kind of person do I believe deserves this?

If it‚Äôs personal love that you want, you might believe the core attribute is having self love. Dedicate yourself to embodying that as a daily aim. Do it in your own way. 

Ask yourself if you were promised ¬£1M if you could be 1% more self-loving in 24 hours, what would you do? It might be you‚Äôll start going gym, or getting massages etc. Or you might believe the core attribute for love is being someone that‚Äôs vulnerable. 

Forget about feeling good or feeling the wish fulfilled.. means nothing. 

If it‚Äôs money, you might believe the core attribute is being generous or following your passions. Dedicate yourself systematically to being more generous with your time and money. Systematically. Forget feelings and emotions.

Aim for worthiness.. a worthiness you can intellectually justify. Worthiness is the key to attracting what you want ‚Ä¶ worthiness is manifestation faith. 

You‚Äôre NOT going to suddenly begin to change decades of hard luck story by affirmations. That‚Äôs not how it happens. 

The lack circumstance is only reflecting your internal misalignment and that distance is fixed‚Ä¶ unless you make OVERstatements in the direction of those core desires.

My life changed drastically within a month when I started virtue signalling generosity. Boom, ¬£100,000 from nowhere. At that time, most money I ever touched at one time was like ¬£2,500. In my mid-30s. I knew then for sure something fundamental had switched .. and it was deliberate.

**My emotions arc:**

When I was deadbeat and broke, I was desperate for money.

Then I began to systematically give more. Small things like putting salt and coffee and toilet paper in the communal areas of my shared house.

After about two weeks, it started to become normal to do these things. I even forgot I was doing them. I think when my mind realised that there wasn‚Äôt any negative impact from being more generous, it made it normal to do.

Then I got a phone call like 2 weeks after that. ¬£100k.. totally unexpected.

Guess what? I wasn‚Äôt even stoked. The only excitement I got was connecting it to the worthiness actions I had begun doing. But I didn‚Äôt feel like I needed the money urgently anymore by that time, but I was super grateful. 

When you truly overstate these core attributes for a while, the need for the desire itself dissipates. Not completely, but there‚Äôs no emotionality around it as much.",1,1729545736.0,lawofattraction,0,1.0,False
1g917ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g917ss/wifes_workplace/,Wife‚Äôs workplace ,"My wife works at a caf√©/coffee shop as the front of house manager. They primarily serve coffee & pastries, but it‚Äôs a nice cozy space. Many folks will work from ‚Äúhome‚Äù there, and/or study, read, etc etc. Your basic coffee spot in a big city. 
Considering she has an hour+ commute, and I‚Äôm in between/job searching right now, this often means I don‚Äôt see her for 10+ hours a day, five or six days a week‚Äî unless I go with her and hangout at the caf√© and apply for jobs, do other work, etc while she works. We like being able to see each other even if it‚Äôs in passing, and she enjoys being able to take her lunch break with me. 
However, her manager has given her a hard time about me being there, and several times has asked me to leave, to make room for other customers. Today, she was asked to sign a policy that essentially said ‚Äúall friends/family of employees are effectively banned from the premises except on rare occasions, and cannot use seating that‚Äôs intended for other customers‚Äù.

Now, I understand some of this. However, my wife has worked in coffee/coffee shops for 10+ years. I‚Äôve known her for five of those years, and at 4 different caf√©s. Not a single one of those shops, nor any manager, has ever had an issue with me working from ‚Äúhome‚Äù there, nor spending any time there, nor taking seats for customers. They are, after all, caf√©s, where the primary purpose is for customers to sit down with a cup of coffee. 

In light of this situation & policy, what would you do? My wife is a very respectful person but she feels like this is overreaching and makes her incredibly stressed just thinking about me stopping by to say ‚Äúhi‚Äù, or grab a cup of coffee with her on her break. 
Should she leave her job in search of another with a less stressful situation?

This morning I noticed what looked like a smeared mop streak on my hardwood flooring about 10 feet in length. Today wasn't a mop day and I didn't notice it yesterday morning when it did mop, so I think it happened during its vacuum routine this morning. Confused I looked around and discovered it sucked up a hairball from the cat that appears was deposited on a nearby area rug in the same room.  At some point it started mopping and ended up making the mess I discovered.  Turning over the freo was petty gross, but cleaned it all out, cleaned the carpet, and then tried to use the mop function to clean up the Hardwood floors. I sent the Freo in three times to try and mop up the mess. It wasn't able to do it. I first tried on mop setting without freo mind enabled, two passes, Normal moisture, and meticulous. That made some improvement, but largely still there. I then enabled the freo mind thinking it would notice the soiled area and clean it up. It didn't. Lastly I edited the map to adjust the floor material to marble which indicates a stronger downward pressure on the mop heads and it still didn't remove the mess. Ultimately cleaned it up with a damp paper towel.  Anyone have any suggestions on what I might do differently to see improved results on a particular trouble spot?  The mess in question  was predominantly a thin layer of smeared wet cat food. It had dried, but looked something like a dried coffee stain on the floor, so thought the freo z would recognize it as a trouble spot.

Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 75% of viral songs on TikTok started with a paid creator marketing campaign, according to one major label marketer's estimates. However there's currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo. Captioning a video with #ad or similar disclosure is required by the FTC when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post, but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song. Some larger creators fetch over $10,000 to use a song in one of their videos, while smaller creators can receive as little as $25 depending on their follower count.
___
The **FTC** adopted a **‚Äòclick to cancel'** rule last week, which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it, and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships. Additionally, businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website, and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online. 
___
**Google** is giving its **Shopping platform** a major overhaul with the help of AI. The company added features like: 1) AI generated shopping assistance, which aim to simplify search with friendly guidance that provide advice and recommendations on what to purchase. 2) Personalized shopping feeds that are comparable to TikTok's ""For You"" feed and showcases recently viewed products at the top, making it easy to resume shopping. 3) New deal finding tools such as price comparisons, price insights, and price tracking, as well as  new dedicated and personalized deals page. 
___
**OpenStore** introduced **OpenDesk**, an AI-powered customer support tool that helps brand respond faster to customers and gain insights on their interactions. The tool enables brands to combine all their customer messages into one central dashboard, with messages automatically organized by topic so that teams can prioritize time-sensitive threads and their most valuable customers. OpenDesk can also auto-draft responses that can be personalized with relevant customer data such as order history, which appear next to the messages pane. Its analytics tools introduce a customer experience metric called ‚Äútickets per order‚Äù to more accurately evaluate and size the potential impact of customer pain points or opportunities to improve your business. OpenStore built OpenDesk to support its own customer service needs across the 40+ e-commerce brands it operates, and now it's opening the tool up to other companies.
___
**Permira** completed its $7.2B acquisition of **Squarespace**, officially taking the company private again. With the completion of the deal, Squarespace is no longer listed on the NYSE. As part of the transaction, Squarespace founder and CEO Anthony Casalena rolled over a majority of his existing equity and continues to be one of the largest shareholders in the company. He will also continue to serve as the company's CEO and Board Chairman.
___
**Mercari** and **Poshmark** are reconsidering their recent shift to buyer fees, away from seller fees. Mercari is currently testing adding buyer fees back into the item price, and Poshmark messaged users indicating that it is rethinking its new fee structure. 
___
**Etsy** sent out a notice informing sellers that moving forward, **Shippo** and **Shipstation** will be the only third-party shipping services to be offered on the website. This means that other providers like Pirate Ship, Easyship, and ShippingEasy will no longer be offered as an integration. There's since been much confusion around what this notice actually means. Pirate Ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an e-mail and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to their connections in the future would be able to continue using Pirate Ship. They later said they are confident that they will, but it's all a little blurry right now as to what to expect with shipping partners and Etsy. 
___
1WorldSync released its fourth annual **Consumer Product Content Benchmark Report**, featuring insights collected from 1,750 shoppers across the US and Canada. A few highlights from the report include: 15% indicated that they are shopping on D2C sites more than in 2023, compared to 21% who are using D2C sites less (which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces). 49% of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews. 31% of shoppers now use ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other AI assistants to help inform their choices, up from 22% last year. However consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking. Just 35% said they found AI tools to be accurate often or always.

**The UK government** is set to introduce **regulations on BNPL** products, aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices. A consultation on the draft legislation began on Oct 17th and will remain open until Nov 29th, with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback. The proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks, clear disclosures, and protections under the Consumer Duty, aligning BNPL with existing credit card rules, much like what the US recently did. The government would offer a transition period for BNPL companies to catch up to speed, to avoid disruptions in the market.
___
**Meanwhile in the USA‚Ä¶** The Financial Technology Association filed a lawsuit challenging the CFPB's new rule on BNPL products, saying that the rule ‚Äúoversteps legal bounds.‚Äù In May, the CFPB ruled that BNPL vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards, such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender. FTA President and CEO Penny Lee said, ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the CFPB‚Äôs rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts, oversteps legal bounds, and risks creating confusion for consumers. The CFPB is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of pay-in-four BNPL products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures, in excess of its statutory authority, and in an unreasonable manner.‚Äù

The tell-all article highlights her interview and new hire experiences at Amazon for the second time, as well as shares how the company has changed under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. Ramo' post received thousands of likes and engagements, with dozens of current and former Amazon employees sharing their similar frustrations about the company in the comments.¬†

**Bonanza**¬†is¬†removing¬†the $2¬†tax¬†fee that it implemented last year for sellers who choose not to use its platform to print shipping labels. Now they want a cookie for their generous move. LOL. The company wrote, ‚ÄúWe understand that every dollar counts. To help lower your expenses and streamline your operations, we are removing the $2 shipping assessment fee starting in November. This last assessment you will receive is November 1st so this means more savings for you and a simpler, more cost-effective process.‚Äù Does it count as ‚Äúhelping to lower expenses‚Äù if you're the one that added the fee in the first place?

**Indian online retailers and marketplaces**¬†sold over $6.5B¬†worth of goods in one week of festive sales, marking a 26% increase YoY. Mobile phones, electronics, consumer durables, home and general merchandise accounted for 3/4 of the total sales.
___
**British authorities**¬†are¬†investigating TikTok¬†for potential money laundering and terrorism financing taking place on its platform via its TikTok Coins, which can be converted back into real money. The regulatory concerns are similar to those associated with cryptocurrency exchanges
___
**X**¬†alerted users¬†that effective Nov 15th, their data can be used to train AI models for third party collaborators, which would extend the data's availability behind the company's own Grok AI model and let X license it to outside companies (like Reddit does with Google). The policy update indicates that users have the ability to opt-out, but it doesn't make it clear how to do so at this time. X is¬†also planning¬†on changing how its block feature works. The change would allow blocked people to see your public posts (instead of seeing nothing like now) ‚Äî they just won't be able to like, repost, or reply. News of these changes resulted in a surge of¬†1M new users¬†signing up for Bluesky in a 48-hour period.¬†

**Amazon**¬†announced plans¬†to invest in three nuclear energy projects that will use a new type of miniature reactor to generator power. AWS Chief Executive Matt Garman said, ‚ÄúNuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040.‚Äù

**Amazon**¬†is¬†piloting¬†a new small-format grocery concept in Chicago called Amazon Grocery that's meant for quick fill-in grocery runs with items like coffee, fruit, and grab-and-go meals. The pilot store is located within the same building as its Whole Foods store, with the goal of removing the need for Whole Foods customers to have to shop elsewhere. Just sell soda in Whole Foods and get it over with already!
___
**Apple**¬†is¬†now allowing businesses¬†to display their logos in phone calls, e-mails, map listings, and Apple Pay transactions. Apple's Business Connect launched in January 2023 and previously let users confirm their details, add photos, offer promotions, and receive orders, but now the new capabilities help businesses personalize their everyday phone call and email experiences.
___
**Blinkit**, an India-based delivery company that promises to deliver groceries and household goods in 10 minutes,¬†introduced¬†a 10 minute return and exchange service for clothing and footwear in select cities The move aims to address common online shopping concerns, such as size and fit issues, by making it relatively instant to swap out your purchases. At that point, the delivery driver might as well wait at your door while you try on the shoes!
___
**Taboola**¬†is¬†unveiling¬†a new AI-powered chat assistant called Abby to help make it easier for advertisers to create and run campaigns. Businesses will be able to enter conversational prompts like, ‚ÄúI own a flower shop and want more people to come to my website to buy flowers,‚Äù and from there the chatbot will spin up an ad campaign including both the text and images.
___
**Alibaba**¬†launched¬†a new large language model called Macro MT that's focused specifically on translations, with the hope of aiding buyers and sellers with cross-border e-commerce and trade efforts. Macro MT will integrate into Alibaba International's platforms including AliExpress, Lazada, and Trendyol, and will support 15 languages at launch, with more on the way.
___
**The Korean government**¬†published plans¬†to require e-commerce marketplaces to pay sales proceeds to sellers within 20 days of when a customer makes a purchase (which is still fairly long in my opinion, but better than nothing). The plan also requires the marketplaces to deposit at least half of the sales proceeds in financial institutions to ensure that sellers can recover at least some of their money if the platform goes bankrupt. The changes are in response to the¬†recent drama¬†with WeMakePrice and Tmon.¬†
___
**Amazon**¬†reprised¬†its ‚Äúholiday beauty haul‚Äù for a fourth year ‚Äî which is its annual two week event where it runs discounts between 10% and 50% off on thousands of gift sets and beauty products on brands like BareMinerals, Clinique, and Maybelline. This year the event will run from today, Oct 21st, through Nov 3rd, with new deals dropping at various times throughout the two weeks.
___
**Meta**¬†fired two dozen¬†Facebook employees at its Los Angeles HQ for ‚Äúabusing‚Äù their $25 meal credits by buying every day goods instead of meals. How does Amazon know I don't eat hand cream? That's personal. Aside from those particular terminations, Meta also¬†laid off, repositioned, and relocated¬†other employees from various departments including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, which the company says is to align with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.¬†
___
**Google's most senior executive**¬†overseeing search and advertising, Prabhakar Raghavan, is¬†leaving the position¬†to become chief technologist after four years leading the company's core business. CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a staff memo, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.‚Äù Nick Fox, a long-serving search executive, will replace Raghavan in the role.
___
**Airbnb**¬†launched¬†a new Co-Host Network that allows hosts to find top-rated co-hosts to help manage their properties. Currently only hosts with at least a 4.8 rating and a minimum of 10 hosted stays are invited to join the network, which is active in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the UK, and the US. Really brilliant idea! Airbnb owners are often looking for management for their properties, and no better place to find it than on the platform itself.¬†
___
**X**¬†dropped¬†**Unilever**¬†from an antitrust lawsuit accusing several companies and advertising groups of conspiring to boycott the platform, which it claims led to a decline in ad revenue. The two companies reached an agreement, with X committing to uphold Unilever's brand safety standards on the platform. Unilever brands include Dove soaps, Hellmann's condiments, and Pepsodent toothpaste. So is the plan to drop the lawsuit only against companies who agree to continue advertising on X? That seems like a weird ‚Äúsettlement‚Äù. Usually settlements don't inflate advertising metrics.¬†¬†
___
**Adobe**¬†started distributing¬†an AI model called Firefly Video Model that can generate video from text prompts and offers a special focus on making the AI footage blend in with conventional footage. Ely Greenfield, Adobe's chief technology officer for digital media, told Reuters, ‚ÄúWe really focus on fine-grain control, teaching the model the concepts that video editors and videographers use ‚Äì things like camera position, camera angle, camera motion.‚Äù
___
**Walmart**¬†is¬†offering¬†an extended holiday returns policy for any items purchased from Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2024 ‚Äî excluding wireless phones, protection plans, AppleCare, precious metals, and luxury items. (What's considered a ‚Äòluxury item' nowadays? Like an apple? Fruit's expensive now in the US.) All non-excluded items can be returned until January 31, 2025. Meanwhile Costco is like, ‚ÄúHold my beer‚Ä¶‚Äù
___
**WhatsApp**¬†is¬†getting a new chat memory feature¬†that gives users a more tailored experience when searching on the app by remembering things like their interests, likes, and enjoyment, or if they are vegan. The feature is still in beta, but once it launches, users will have control over what the chatbot remembers, and they'll be able to remove and update data.¬†
___
**eBay**¬†introduced¬†a new ‚ÄúTop-Service‚Äù label in Germany, allowing commercial sellers to stand out on the platform by highlighting certain aspects of their service, such as timely shipping and above average customer service. Sellers do not need to sign up to be eligible to receive the label, which does not have a cost. Alongside the change, eBay Germany is dropping its ‚ÄúeBay Guarantee‚Äù and ‚ÄúeBay Plus‚Äù logos.
___
**Bestbuy Baby**, which has nothing to do with Best Buy the electronics retailer and is actually a baby retailer that had been part of the Bed Bath & Beyond group, is¬†closing all of its brick-and-mortar stores¬†to relaunch as a strictly online platform. The retailer previously closed and liquidated 115 locations last year when its parent company went bankrupt, but then months later announced a new strategy and the opening of 11 new stores, which will soon be shuttered.
___
**TikTok Shop**¬†is¬†introducing the sale¬†of refurbished electronics from select sellers on its platform, all which are required to meet specific performance standards. For example, sellers must provide reports from an approved 3rd party like PhoneCheck, Blancco, or BlackBelt, who inspect and rate the quality of the refurbished products. Currently only ‚Äúpremium‚Äù or ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù items can be sold.
___
Plus 9 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest, including **Klarna** selling most of its portfolio of short-term, interest-free loans to Elliott Advisors, a London-based hedge fund, for ¬£30B.

The nightlife feels dead an even when I went to an Erasmus event it was like 20 people and most of them were already together so no chance.

1g90sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1g90sad/how_i_got_a_sweet_little_revenge_on_my_ex/,How I got a sweet little revenge on my ex,"My ex and I dated for almost an year. He took my virginity and I always wanted to do all types of things with him. I made that man so happy in bed, one time I blew him 3 times in one day just because I wanted to.
I told him once that I would like to do a threesome, with a girl because I also had a secret wish of doing things with a girl, so that would be the best of both worlds.
He expressed that that was a kink of his aswell. When we talked about this it was very early on, I don‚Äôt think we were even dating yet.
When it got brought up again later in the relationship, I said that you couldn‚Äôt have a threesome with someone you love, but now looking back I only said that because he didn‚Äôt make me feel secure in the relationship, so I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable doing that with him because our relationship wasn‚Äôt stable enough. Complicated stuff. 

Well we broke up some months ago, because while we did have fucking good chemistry, it wasn‚Äôt working so well emotionally.
He was pretty shitty to me especially after the breakup. He got with another girl like not even a month later and if it was just for sex I would have understood, but it seemed that it was to fill the emotional void aswell, and I can‚Äôt stand people that do that. 

A few weeks ago he asked me if I wanted to meet up for coffee or to talk, I said that coffee was a bit much but that we could talk. I found it weird that he wanted to meet up with me when he is already seeing someone else, but he always said he wanted to remain in my life. Pretty sure the girl doesnt know anything about me or about anything at all.
Well we met up and this is where I got my revenge. I told him I had done a threesome, and he was PISSED, his face showed it instantlly. I‚Äôm a very good girl but I am good in bed and very confident in my body, and he always liked that. His new girl doesnt seem to be like that at all, but oh well he made his choice. 
Im not like this at all but this time it felt sooo good to a get a little innocent revenge.",0,1729544649.0,pettyrevenge,3,0.38,False

1g90r95,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/1g90r95/request_birthday_cards_to_celebrate_33_usa/,[Request] Birthday Cards to celebrate 33! [USA],"Hi all! Just a little request here for some birthday cards for my 33rd birthday coming up November 15th!

  
Let's just say that 32... really sucked. I lost both my mom and my dog of 12 years. Both my husband and I had various sicknesses that knocked us out for several weeks. And overall we haven't really had the opportunity to adjust and grow in this new place we called home (we moved about 3 months before my birthday last year to a brand new city and state). That's not to say that there wasn't a lot of good to be found this year, it's just been overshadowed by all the sadness....

So, I'd love to start off 33 the right way with lots of happy mail from you all. If you have an extra birthday card lying around your stash, would you perhaps be willing to send it my way? It would truly make my day.

  
If you'd like to perhaps find a card just for me, I love anything to do with: animals (especially dogs and cats), tea, coffee, baked goods, children's literature, Disney, The Muppets, Snoopy and the Peanuts gang, Animal Crossing, and anything cottage-core feeling. Purple is my favorite color.

  
If you're willing to send me something, thank you in advance, but of course I'll post a thank you on the wall as well. Also, if we've exchange mail this year, double check with me about the address-- I'm moving at the beginning of November, so I wanna make sure I actually receive the amazing thing you send me.",5,1729544578.0,RandomActsofCards,5,1.0,False

Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 75% of viral songs on TikTok started with a paid creator marketing campaign, according to one major label marketer's estimates. However there's currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo. Captioning a video with #ad or similar disclosure is required by the FTC when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post, but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song. Some larger creators fetch over $10,000 to use a song in one of their videos, while smaller creators can receive as little as $25 depending on their follower count.
___
The **FTC** adopted a **‚Äòclick to cancel'** rule last week, which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it, and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships. Additionally, businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website, and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online. 
___
**Google** is giving its **Shopping platform** a major overhaul with the help of AI. The company added features like: 1) AI generated shopping assistance, which aim to simplify search with friendly guidance that provide advice and recommendations on what to purchase. 2) Personalized shopping feeds that are comparable to TikTok's ""For You"" feed and showcases recently viewed products at the top, making it easy to resume shopping. 3) New deal finding tools such as price comparisons, price insights, and price tracking, as well as  new dedicated and personalized deals page. 
___
**OpenStore** introduced **OpenDesk**, an AI-powered customer support tool that helps brand respond faster to customers and gain insights on their interactions. The tool enables brands to combine all their customer messages into one central dashboard, with messages automatically organized by topic so that teams can prioritize time-sensitive threads and their most valuable customers. OpenDesk can also auto-draft responses that can be personalized with relevant customer data such as order history, which appear next to the messages pane. Its analytics tools introduce a customer experience metric called ‚Äútickets per order‚Äù to more accurately evaluate and size the potential impact of customer pain points or opportunities to improve your business. OpenStore built OpenDesk to support its own customer service needs across the 40+ e-commerce brands it operates, and now it's opening the tool up to other companies.
___
**Permira** completed its $7.2B acquisition of **Squarespace**, officially taking the company private again. With the completion of the deal, Squarespace is no longer listed on the NYSE. As part of the transaction, Squarespace founder and CEO Anthony Casalena rolled over a majority of his existing equity and continues to be one of the largest shareholders in the company. He will also continue to serve as the company's CEO and Board Chairman.
___
**Mercari** and **Poshmark** are reconsidering their recent shift to buyer fees, away from seller fees. Mercari is currently testing adding buyer fees back into the item price, and Poshmark messaged users indicating that it is rethinking its new fee structure. 
___
**Etsy** sent out a notice informing sellers that moving forward, **Shippo** and **Shipstation** will be the only third-party shipping services to be offered on the website. This means that other providers like Pirate Ship, Easyship, and ShippingEasy will no longer be offered as an integration. There's since been much confusion around what this notice actually means. Pirate Ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an e-mail and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to their connections in the future would be able to continue using Pirate Ship. They later said they are confident that they will, but it's all a little blurry right now as to what to expect with shipping partners and Etsy. 
___
1WorldSync released its fourth annual **Consumer Product Content Benchmark Report**, featuring insights collected from 1,750 shoppers across the US and Canada. A few highlights from the report include: 15% indicated that they are shopping on D2C sites more than in 2023, compared to 21% who are using D2C sites less (which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces). 49% of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews. 31% of shoppers now use ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other AI assistants to help inform their choices, up from 22% last year. However consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking. Just 35% said they found AI tools to be accurate often or always.
___
**The UK government** is set to introduce **regulations on BNPL** products, aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices. A consultation on the draft legislation began on Oct 17th and will remain open until Nov 29th, with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback. The proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks, clear disclosures, and protections under the Consumer Duty, aligning BNPL with existing credit card rules, much like what the US recently did. The government would offer a transition period for BNPL companies to catch up to speed, to avoid disruptions in the market.
___
**Meanwhile in the USA‚Ä¶** The Financial Technology Association filed a lawsuit challenging the CFPB's new rule on BNPL products, saying that the rule ‚Äúoversteps legal bounds.‚Äù In May, the CFPB ruled that BNPL vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards, such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender. FTA President and CEO Penny Lee said, ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the CFPB‚Äôs rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts, oversteps legal bounds, and risks creating confusion for consumers. The CFPB is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of pay-in-four BNPL products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures, in excess of its statutory authority, and in an unreasonable manner.‚Äù
___
**Former Amazon employee**¬†Stephanie Ramos¬†shared the reasons¬†why she quit Amazon just 11 weeks after rejoining the company, which she previously worked at for six years. The tell-all article highlights her interview and new hire experiences at Amazon for the second time, as well as shares how the company has changed under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. Ramo' post received thousands of likes and engagements, with dozens of current and former Amazon employees sharing their similar frustrations about the company in the comments.¬†
___
**Bonanza**¬†is¬†removing¬†the $2¬†tax¬†fee that it implemented last year for sellers who choose not to use its platform to print shipping labels. Now they want a cookie for their generous move. LOL. The company wrote, ‚ÄúWe understand that every dollar counts. To help lower your expenses and streamline your operations, we are removing the $2 shipping assessment fee starting in November. This last assessment you will receive is November 1st so this means more savings for you and a simpler, more cost-effective process.‚Äù Does it count as ‚Äúhelping to lower expenses‚Äù if you're the one that added the fee in the first place?
___
**Indian online retailers and marketplaces**¬†sold over $6.5B¬†worth of goods in one week of festive sales, marking a 26% increase YoY. Mobile phones, electronics, consumer durables, home and general merchandise accounted for 3/4 of the total sales.
___
**British authorities**¬†are¬†investigating TikTok¬†for potential money laundering and terrorism financing taking place on its platform via its TikTok Coins, which can be converted back into real money. The regulatory concerns are similar to those associated with cryptocurrency exchanges
___
**X**¬†alerted users¬†that effective Nov 15th, their data can be used to train AI models for third party collaborators, which would extend the data's availability behind the company's own Grok AI model and let X license it to outside companies (like Reddit does with Google). The policy update indicates that users have the ability to opt-out, but it doesn't make it clear how to do so at this time. X is¬†also planning¬†on changing how its block feature works. The change would allow blocked people to see your public posts (instead of seeing nothing like now) ‚Äî they just won't be able to like, repost, or reply. News of these changes resulted in a surge of¬†1M new users¬†signing up for Bluesky in a 48-hour period.¬†
___
**Amazon**¬†announced plans¬†to invest in three nuclear energy projects that will use a new type of miniature reactor to generator power. AWS Chief Executive Matt Garman said, ‚ÄúNuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040.‚Äù
___
**Klarna's BNPL payment options**¬†are¬†now available¬†to¬†**Apple Pay**¬†users in the US and UK with options including pay in three or four installments and financing for higher-ticket items. The offering will be expanded globally, with Canada set to be added next in the coming months.¬†
___
**Amazon**¬†is¬†piloting¬†a new small-format grocery concept in Chicago called Amazon Grocery that's meant for quick fill-in grocery runs with items like coffee, fruit, and grab-and-go meals. The pilot store is located within the same building as its Whole Foods store, with the goal of removing the need for Whole Foods customers to have to shop elsewhere. Just sell soda in Whole Foods and get it over with already!

**Apple**¬†is¬†now allowing businesses¬†to display their logos in phone calls, e-mails, map listings, and Apple Pay transactions. Apple's Business Connect launched in January 2023 and previously let users confirm their details, add photos, offer promotions, and receive orders, but now the new capabilities help businesses personalize their everyday phone call and email experiences.

Macro MT will integrate into Alibaba International's platforms including AliExpress, Lazada, and Trendyol, and will support 15 languages at launch, with more on the way.

The plan also requires the marketplaces to deposit at least half of the sales proceeds in financial institutions to ensure that sellers can recover at least some of their money if the platform goes bankrupt. The changes are in response to the¬†recent drama¬†with WeMakePrice and Tmon.¬†

This year the event will run from today, Oct 21st, through Nov 3rd, with new deals dropping at various times throughout the two weeks.
___
**Meta**¬†fired two dozen¬†Facebook employees at its Los Angeles HQ for ‚Äúabusing‚Äù their $25 meal credits by buying every day goods instead of meals. How does Amazon know I don't eat hand cream? That's personal. Aside from those particular terminations, Meta also¬†laid off, repositioned, and relocated¬†other employees from various departments including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, which the company says is to align with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.¬†
___
**Google's most senior executive**¬†overseeing search and advertising, Prabhakar Raghavan, is¬†leaving the position¬†to become chief technologist after four years leading the company's core business. CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a staff memo, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.‚Äù Nick Fox, a long-serving search executive, will replace Raghavan in the role.
___
**Airbnb**¬†launched¬†a new Co-Host Network that allows hosts to find top-rated co-hosts to help manage their properties. Currently only hosts with at least a 4.8 rating and a minimum of 10 hosted stays are invited to join the network, which is active in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the UK, and the US. Really brilliant idea! Airbnb owners are often looking for management for their properties, and no better place to find it than on the platform itself.¬†
___
**X**¬†dropped¬†**Unilever**¬†from an antitrust lawsuit accusing several companies and advertising groups of conspiring to boycott the platform, which it claims led to a decline in ad revenue. The two companies reached an agreement, with X committing to uphold Unilever's brand safety standards on the platform. Unilever brands include Dove soaps, Hellmann's condiments, and Pepsodent toothpaste. So is the plan to drop the lawsuit only against companies who agree to continue advertising on X? That seems like a weird ‚Äúsettlement‚Äù. Usually settlements don't inflate advertising metrics.¬†¬†

1g90pex,https://www.reddit.com/r/DavidHawkins/comments/1g90pex/1_year_update/,1 year update,"Hello Community.

  
I came across Doc in march of 23. I read Letting go for the first time in April of that year, and that summer I dove into practice. from then to now I've posted here once or twice, but nothing consistent. I have sat in the feeling and allowed it to the best of my ability without distraction. I have done this practice as thoroughly as I can. 

  
I came into it with a massive fear that still lingers, and I continue to let go on it. I found Doc because of other conscious practices. one of them was the law of assumption which basically states that any feeling if persisted in will harden into fact and manifestations liken to that feeling will appear in my life.

  
so my fear in letting go was that if I sit in the feeling with the intention to relieve the pressure and allow it, then the manifestations of that feeling would continue in my life, thus keeping me relatively ""trapped"" there.

  
at first this was the situation- however, to be completely honest. it has gotten 100% worse. I have found myself in an impossible snowball. Poverty, apathy, involuntary celibacy, guilt, fear, and misery is my baseline. my car is always breaking, unforeseen bills appear, my children love me deeply but I feel like a horrific failure of a father. I have not had a date in years, I am always over draft. I lost my Job with no income in sight, I am months behind on bills. I get a job interview, only to be text right before it or days before telling em the position has been filled. it's like there is a barrier between myself and any form of success. I would be beyond surprised if this post even gets up as if some cosmic thing prevents it. 

  
I am struggling mightily, worse than maybe ever. and art feels like it's been this way my entire life. I've done therapy, meditations, retreats, letting go, persisting, meds, plant meds, leaning into life completely and allowing what ever wants to happen, and trying to manage it. I feel like nothing works for me. I dont use any substances outside of coffee, and I feel like my entire 4 decades of life are truly a waste.

I don‚Äôt know how much time I have so I‚Äôll try to keep this short. I‚Äôve barricaded the door but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll hold much longer. I‚Äôm trapped in this tiny utility closet with no way out except for that door, and I can already hear their wet cracking and squelching. Good, that fucking sound. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm getting out of here alive, so I‚Äôll try to get the message out to the outside world. I‚Äôm done for, but maybe some of you can send help to anyone still alive. If there are any.

The sounds are gone, but it might just be alerting it‚Äôs friends. Maybe it‚Äôs left for good, but I can‚Äôt get my hopes up. I need to focus on getting the message out, then maybe if I‚Äôm not actively under attack I‚Äôll try to get out. 

Anyway, I guess I have to start somewhere. I‚Äôm Andy McNamara, 43 years old, janitor at Junesburgh Highschool. First odd occurrence? That must‚Äôve been last Thursday, when they found that dead dog. 

Junesburgh High isn‚Äôt a big or famous school, but we do, erm did have a pretty decent swim team. Really the only thing we had to offer. The building is connected to the local swimming pools by a corridor, and the swim team practices there pretty often. Well, I wasn‚Äôt personally there to witness it but apparently last Thursday the kids found a dead dog in one of the pools. Drowned, the poor thing. I don‚Äôt think it was clear who‚Äôs dog it was, although I heard rumors of it being old man Jonesy‚Äôs beagle. Kids were pretty shook up, but their coach, Sally Vernon, took care of it. She didn‚Äôt even call me in to take care of the body, but she‚Äôs always been a pretty hands-on type person so I figure she dealt with it just fine on her own. 

No one knows exactly how it got there, the pools are open to the public but obviously dogs are not allowed in there so that doesn‚Äôt explain it. Maybe it snuck in somewhere, I don‚Äôt know. How a dog managed to drown is a different mystery, considering there are stairs going into the water in the shallow part. But, there‚Äôs no way to explain it. A tragic happening, that shut down the pools over the weekend, but nothing more. Or so we thought.

Things were back to normal on Monday, expect for the kids complaining about a foul smell in the bathrooms and in the showers. We‚Äôve had multiple issues with plumbing in the past so no one thought about it, just assumed it‚Äôd be gone after a day or two and if it was any longer then we‚Äôd maybe check it out. Stupid bastards.

It was today, on Tuesday that something went really wrong. See, I was taking my lunch break in the security guard‚Äôs room. The security guard himself, a young man named Henry Anderson, may God rest his soul, was a fairly nice kid, a little bit of an overachiever considering he was paid pennies to guard a small town highschool, but other than that perfectly pleasant. We‚Äôd gotten pretty close, comparing our work experiences and helping each other out whenever possible. We were both eating lunch, dry sandwiches and watery coffee, talking about nothing special when suddenly Henry‚Äôs walkie-talkie crackled to life. It was Sally. She sounded frantic. 

‚ÄúHenry, Henry you need to get here, now! Something‚Äôs-‚Äú

She cut herself off. Henry and I looked at each other. There were noises in the background. Strange noises. It was hard to hear through the crackly walkie-talkie, but it sounded like frantic babbling. Maybe crying? Sally yelled something unintelligible, then returned.

‚ÄúHenry turn your goddamn cameras on, then get your ass over here. There‚Äôs something in the pools‚Äù

The walkie-talkie abruptly shut off, and we sat in silence for a moment.

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Äù mumbled Henry. He leaned over, and fiddled with his computers. The security cameras overlooking the pools were only on at night, for the privacy of the visitors and to only look out for nightly intruders. But this was clearly an emergency. Henry got up and grabbed his baton, the most dangerous weapon he was allowed to carry.

‚ÄúYou keep an eye on that, I‚Äôll see what‚Äôs going on‚Äù

I just nodded, put down my coffee cup and moved over to the computers. Henry ducked out of the room and I heard him jog away. The corridor to the pools was only a couple minutes walk away from here, he‚Äôd be there in a moment if he ran.

I switched on the right cameras and took in the sight. The cameras were old and the footage blurry and grainy as all hell, but I could make out the strangely dim poolroom. I saw the biggest pool in somewhat clear view. I couldn‚Äôt entirely make out what was going on. I saw the drain in the middle as a dark spot, that seemed to writhe under the disturbed surface. At first I thought it was simply a trick of the light and shifting waters, but no. There was something billowing around, out of the drain. Something dark and ‚Ä¶ hairy? Whatever it was it was moving out of the drain, seemingly growing from the size of a cat or small dog to something bigger as it got more space to move. Something vaguely resembling a person. The shifting surface made it hard to get a grip on it‚Äôs appearance, but it seemed to have two arms, a torso and a head. It also seemed to be covered in hair.

Suddenly I saw movement in the corner of the screen. I‚Äôd been staring in a trance at the thing. But now I saw Sally. She was moving irrationally. At first I thought she was having a seizure, but as she stumbled more into frame I saw the humanoid thing gripping her, almost like a hug. It‚Äôs face was buried in her neck, which seemed strange until it yanked it‚Äôs head away and I saw the huge, gaping wound in her throat. Blood sprayed, and the creature dig back in, tearing of more meat. Sally‚Äôs head lulled back, only held on by a few tendons and some skin. The creature dropped her, and crouched over her, tearing into her lifeless body. Blood began pooling, dripping into the water, dying it bright red.

I stared in horror. It was all over in a few seconds, but watching that thing rip into her flesh and bones like it was nothing felt like watching a seven hour snuff movie. I saw something red and tube-like slip into the pool and realized with a choked sob that it was her intestines.

I was about to shut off the computer when I remembered Henry. Oh God, Henry. He‚Äôd be there any second. I grabbed my walkie-talkie with such force I worried I‚Äôd break it, and practically screamed.

‚ÄúHenry! Henry!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey man, what‚Äôs going on? You see something on the cameras?‚Äù

‚ÄúHenry get the fuck outta there! You need to run!‚Äù

‚ÄúMan you‚Äôre freaking me out. Saw a bunch of students running out of the corridor, what, did they find another do-‚Äú

Henry got quiet. Very, very quiet. I didn‚Äôt see him on the cameras but I knew he stood by the entrance to the pools. I could hear heavy breathing in the walkie-talkie.

The creature in the pool was crawling up the steps, but froze as it spotted Henry. 

I could feel the tension so thick it was suffocating. I didn‚Äôt dare to breathe. From the walkie-talkie I could hear a faint tearing and cracking over the static, and a much clearer, much closer whimpering.

‚ÄúHenry‚Äù I whispered, mostly to myself. I don‚Äôt think the walkie-talkie even picked it up. Henry‚Äôs whimpering grew into a low groan. The creature lunged.

The scream that echoed out from my walkie-talkie was the most horrific thing I‚Äôve ever heard. It filled the security guard room for a second, before being cut short with a series of terrible tearing, cracking and ripping noises. I shrieked myself and hurled it away from me, smack into a wall where it broke. I just sat there, screaming for a second before breaking into sobs. I vomited right on the floor, splashing my pants and shoes with undigested sandwich. I couldn‚Äôt stop dry heaving and crying. I couldn‚Äôt even think straight. What was that thing? I glanced back at the screen and felt another wave of panic and nausea. There were four of them on land, in view of the camera, and more coming from the drain. Their features were blurred by the static, but I could make out thin, gnarled bodies and bony limbs with odd-looking joints. Inky skin with some tufts of wet hair. Vaguely humanoid heads. And God, they were big. It was hard to tell exactly but they must‚Äôve been at least seven feet tall, in their strange hunched postures. 

What was left of Sally‚Äôs body slipped into the pool, turning the already red-tinted water even murkier, making it harder to see the things crawling out of the drain. I saw blood pooling in the corner of the screen, and knew it was Henry.

The creatures suddenly began moving. They went offscreen, into the corridor. Into the school. 

I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit that I panicked. I mean, there ain‚Äôt no HR training for ‚Äúdemons crawling out of the pool drains and eating people‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. The security guard has access to the PA system, for security purposes. I threw myself in the thing, barely able to keep my voice from giving out.

‚ÄúAll students and teachers, I-‚Äú

I had no idea what to say, so I improvised.

‚ÄúSomething terrible has happened in the pools, you need to take cover in your classrooms. If you‚Äôre not in one, either go into the closest one or lock yourself in the bathroom and don‚Äôt go out. You understand? This is an emergency, don‚Äôt go into the halls for the love of God, just stay put!‚Äù

My voice gave in and I just collapsed, trying to calm my breathing. We were going to be fine. This was ok. I was ok.

That‚Äôs when I heard it. It was far in the distance. It was a sound I will never forget. A wet sort of cracking, like cracking eggs. And then this almost squelching sound. Accompanied by this incessant dripping noise.

I didn‚Äôt need to see what it was. I knew exactly what was prowling the halls.

A quick glance at the door almost made me break down again. It wasn‚Äôt locked. I hurled myself at it, locking it and then immediately pushing over a shelf to barricade it. I didn‚Äôt care about the noise. I needed to keep that thing out. 

I stood completely still, not daring to do anything else. It was all quiet and still outside.

What first hit me was the smell. It crept through the cracks like smoke, an overwhelming stench of sewage and chlorine. I tried my best not to cough as it got stronger. And then the sounds got louder. The cracking, the dripping and the squelching. I tried not to gag. I covered my face and tried to breathe normally. IamsafeIamsafeIamsafeIamsafeIamsafe, I chanted in my head. 

When I looked up again I screamed.

Pressed against the tiny window on the door was the most horrific face I‚Äôd ever seen. Pitch black skin covered in an oily layer. Rotted flesh flaying off, revealing something hard and smooth below. Random tufts of hair that looked more like what clogs your sink rather than normal hair. A large, staring eye. Watching me. Quietly observing. It was pressed so hard against the glass I could hear the strain that was put on it. It had smeared something dark red all over it.

We just stared at each other. All that was heard was that dripping and a deep, labored breathing that wasn‚Äôt my own. 

Then, as quick as it had appeared it disappeared. Leaving a red sheen on the glass, with minuscule cracks formed on it. I sucked in a massive breath, and tried to stop myself from passing out.

Something slammed into the door with such force it shook the room. I shrieked and stumbled back. Another slam, window shattering and showering me with glass. Another, and the door was groaning under the force. It wasn‚Äôt going to hold. 

I got to my feet, glancing around in a panic. Nothing to use as a weapon. Then I spotted the door. A door that lead out to the neighboring corridor. Out to more monsters.

I hesitated. Another slam, and part of the door splintered. I threw myself as my escape door, barely able to twist the knob but finally succeeding, running into the corridor and throwing the door closed behind me. 

I ran. I didn‚Äôt know where I was running, I was just trying to get away. I didn‚Äôt stop until that smell was gone, and until I couldn‚Äôt hear the crashing sounds in the security guard room. 

I stopped and leaned against a wall, trying to catch my breath. My lungs hurt, my legs burned. I saw black spots dancing around. I took a moment to breathe, then anxiously checked my surroundings. It was silent, and empty. That scared me even more.

My next plan was to head for the exit. I needed to get help. I wasn‚Äôt far from the main entrance, I just needed to get there. My steps echoed and my breathing seemed to fill the halls, I was so tense it hurt. Legs shook so bad I could barely walk, but I kept on going. It wasn‚Äôt far, just had to get to the entrance. 

I passed several classrooms, where it was quiet and dark. That was a good thing, hopefully. I consider knocking on the door to see if I could slip in and hide with them, but I doubted they‚Äôd let me in. I needed to get to the entrance. Just had to get there. It was close. The things probably hadn‚Äôt gotten that far. Just get to the entrance, it‚Äôs so close.

I turned a corner, freedom so close I could taste it‚Äôs funky air. Wait-

It was there. A creature, easily twice my height. Right in front of the door, hunched over the body of Mary-Anne Wilkinson, the principal. It was tearing of huge pieces of flesh, chewing with grotesquely wet sounds, easily cracking bones between it‚Äôs powerful jaws. Her guts spilled out over the floor, blood smeared all the way to the door. She‚Äôd been so close, fighting the monster to the end. But it hadn‚Äôt mattered. Now she was food for this demon from the drain, which was completely focused on it‚Äôs feast. It hadn‚Äôt noticed me. I shook so badly it should‚Äôve heard me but no.

The thing tore into her arm, grinding bones to dust and shredding her bicep muscle. That‚Äôs when I heard it. A low, quiet moan.

She was still alive. 

I couldn‚Äôt stop the horrified little squeak that escaped my throat. The thing‚Äôs eyes immediately snapped up, looking right at me. 

Something warm and wet tricked down my leg. The monster observed me, tilting it‚Äôs head to the left. Contemplating me. All while chewing on a piece of skin and meat. 

I felt lightheaded, and wondered if passing out was the preferable way to go.

The thing swallowed loudly, tilted it‚Äôs head back and let out a deep, guttural bellow. It shook every bone in my body, caused my teeth to clatter and my muscles to tighten. Then it went back to feeding, ripping Mary-Anne‚Äôs arm clean off it‚Äôs socket. 

I fled. I could hear excited , inhuman chattering somewhere in the corridor but I didn‚Äôt dare look back. I ran until I saw an open door, which I hurled myself through. I flipped over every shelf, pushed chairs and tables against it, then curled up in a corner, trying to stay quiet. 

And that catches you up to everything that‚Äôs happened. I‚Äôve been here for hours. I‚Äôve heard screaming, howling, chattering. That smell has passed me more times than I can count. It took me a damn long time to realize I had my phone i my pocket, and I cried with relief. That was until I realized I couldn‚Äôt call anyone. Something‚Äôs blocking my calls, and the police won‚Äôt even pick up. I don‚Äôt understand. I have some Wi-Fi, but I can‚Äôt get in contact with anyone. 

I‚Äôm posting this here so that maybe someone can help me. Please, if you can, call the police, fire department, the goddamn military to Juneburgh Highschool in Maryland! We need you. The ones that are left.

It‚Äôs been so quiet since I started writing. Maybe they are gone? I can‚Äôt take this anymore, I‚Äôm going to try to get out. I‚Äôm pretty close to an emergency exit I think. If I don‚Äôt update this I‚Äôm probably dead. I just wanna say, Madeleine, I‚Äôm so sorry, and Stacy, I‚Äôm even more sorry. Please forgive me. I love you. I need to go. I‚Äôm sorry.

I'm in my early 40s and he was in his early 70s. I moved out of my house and across the country when I was in my early 20s, I had a great relationship with both of my parents. We tried to get together as much as possible, but it wasn't enough. We'd talk every other week, but sometimes it stretched to once a month, maybe even longer. My mom and dad came to visit me a couple of times, and I visited them every other year or so. Not often enough.

4 and a half years ago I had a daughter and my mom and dad were both thrilled and crushed. Happy they were grandparents, but also sad that they wouldn't see her often. She was born at the peak of COVID and it was a complicated pregnancy, so they couldn't come to see her until she was 2. My grandmother passed away last year and I made a choice to bring my daughter out to meet all of my family members and spend time with my mom and dad. Life's too short I thought, she needs to meet everyone while she has a chance (life's short...understatement now).

Got a call from my mom this morning - my dad woke up for work and left the house. He stopped to pickup coffee on the way, but then returned home not feeling well. He came back into the room where my mom was still sleeping and told her that he thought ""something was wrong"". He laid down on the bed while my mom called 911 and he never got back up off that bed.

I just got back home from our visit last week, and now my dad is gone forever. He'll never see his grand daughter grow up, and I'll never see him again. I'm filled with regret now, I didn't spend enough time with him and didn't appreciate enough the time we had. He wasn't in the best health, but certainly nothing life threatening we were aware of, I'm just in shock and I feel numb. Now I'm planning a trip back for a funeral, trying to decide if my daughter should come along, and trying to determine how to explain to a 4 and a half year old that her ""Grumps"" is gone.

1g90eux,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarolinaBeach/comments/1g90eux/visiting_in_november/,Visiting in November,"Hi everyone! 

My husband and I will be visiting in early November. Neither of us have ever been to the area, but we are looking forward to it! I had a couple of questions, which I'm researching on my own, too, but it's nice to get info from multiple sources. 

* **Fly Fishing:** My husband likes to fish, specifically fly fishing. All the companies I've seen are about $500 for a half day so I suppose that's the going rate. With price seemingly the same across the board, is there a company you'd recommend over the others? 

* **Co-working Space:** On the first day of our trip, my husband will need to work. Since we can't check into our VRBO until 3pm, we are looking for a co-working space with a daily pass (not a monthly membership). I found one, The Common Desk - it's about 30 minutes from the area. That's fine, but I'm wondering if there are any other co-working spaces closer to Carolina Beach OR if there are any great coffee shops in Carolina Beach that are good for working (i.e. not as crowded/loud/etc)? 
   * We may consider asking our VRBO host if we can check in any earlier that day so that he can work from the condo, but that's not a guarantee and we understand that. Looking for backup plans (co-working space, coffee shop) if need be. 

* **Carolina Beach Boardwalk:** We know we are visiting during the off-season (life just worked out that way - we wanted to see the beach this year and this is the only time we can do it). Is the boardwalk totally closed down this time of year? Is ANYTHING on the boardwalk opened? We likely wouldn't ride the rides anyway, but any games/shops/restaurants that might still be open? Is it available for you to even walk around the boardwalk or, if it's closed for the season, do they prohibit you from even going on it in the first place? 

* **Restaurants:** Give me your best recs! Unfortunately, my husband is deathly allergic to shellfish so that limits our options (I know, why are we visiting the beach then? Again... because we want to!). We're open to most types of food and are fine with a mix of high end and hole in the wall places. We'd like a good steakhouse one night if possible. 

* **Activities in general:** Honestly, we kind of just want to chill. Read a book on the beach depending on the weather. Sit on the condo balcony and enjoy some wine. Whatever. BUT we also want to plan a few things as well. We don't want to overload ourselves, but we'd like a few things on the schedule that will get us out and about. Any recommendations (in addition to fly fishing recs mentioned above) for: 
   * Ferry rides 
   * Sunset boat cruises 
   * Museums and/or history related things (inside or outside)
   * Any other noteworthy things to do in the area! 

I know I'm asking a lot in one post so I appreciate any guidance or recommendations you have! Thank you so much. ",2,1729543727.0,CarolinaBeach,1,1.0,False

**A young waitress recalls her bizarre experience with a regular customer. The customer's mannerisms are routine, but that changed (and ended) that night.**¬†

***I received the following account:***

""Hi. I've been reading your site and thought that my story would interest you. One of my jobs, when I was young (18), was at a Coney-Island-style restaurant in my city. The restaurant was open 24/6, we closed at 3 am Sunday morning, re-opened at 6 am Monday morning, but stayed open all the time the rest of the week.

This particular thing happened at about 2:30 am on a Friday. I was the only waitress on shift and the owner was in the kitchen cooking. We were the only two people there.

At the time we had a regular I‚Äôll call Max. Max was a barfly and a senior citizen. He would come in every night after the bar closed; he would have coffee, two eggs over-easy, and wheat toast. He ordered the same thing every time and every time his total came to $4.37. He‚Äôd give me $6 and tell me to keep the change.

So as I‚Äôm rolling silverware and waiting for our old pal Max I see a few emergency vehicles go down the main street towards the bar. Lights and sirens are on. About a minute later Max comes in, I get him coffee and ask him if he knows what‚Äôs going on. He just shook his head no. So I told my boss Max was there and my boss waved at him through the kitchen window and within 3 minutes Max‚Äôs order was up. He‚Äôs sitting at the counter and after a little while he slaps down some money and says, ‚ÄúKeep the change, honey‚Äù like he usually does, and walks out. I went over to cash out the check and the food hadn‚Äôt been touched, neither had the coffee, and there was a $100 bill on the counter. I was a teen mom and perpetually broke so that much money was basically life-changing at the time.



I saw in the paper on Sunday that Max had been involved in a fight at the bar that night and had been fatally injured."" F

He moved in with us in 2015 when I was 13 years old and married my mum shortly after. He has 50 shades of trauma including being a US veteran who served in afghanistan, emotionally and physically abusive parents of his own, and a bunch of other things that have resulted in severe anger issues. Growing up, getting screamed at multiple times a week while we sobbed was the normal routine for my brother and I. He uses our fear of his outbursts for get us to say and do whatever he wants (is this coercive control?? idk) 

I have a complicated relationship with my mother because of this. I understand that she is a victim in her own right and that he uses fear to control her too, but she things the sun shines out of his ass. She is constantly making excuses for him because she loves him. She is so passive and has never tried to protect me or my brother. He has her convinced that her husband should come before her kids (as she told me verbatim) and that she shouldn‚Äôt keep secrets from him ever. 

My younger brother moved out several months ago because he couldn‚Äôt take it anymore so it‚Äôs just been me at home. There was an explosive episode the other morning (i would say argument but that implies that i was saying anything back lol) and it was pretty bad. We had a ‚Äúfamily talk‚Äù about it last night and it was basically just gaslighting 101. Please see below for a direct quote from my step dad:

‚Äúthe reason I get angry is because you really agitate me. And the only people I let agitate me are the people I care about. So when I get angry at you it‚Äôs because I love you‚Äù

Yeah‚Ä¶ anyway. My Bio Dad has been very helpful. He has found a place for me to live which I can afford on my income and is in a different city. Whenever I decided will be a good time to move out, he is going to drive down to me and help me move everything into the new place. I think it might be best to not tell my mum and step dad that I am moving until right before the move date because they have been very clear about not wanting me to move out and have been really discoursing because ‚ÄúI still need to learn some lessons‚Äù whatever the fuck that means. 

Once I move out, I know that I need to go no contact. do not plan on having a discussion with my step dad about going no contact because i can already tell you that that won‚Äôt go very well. But I do want to have a conversation with my mum. I understand that she is not my responsibility and that she is a grown adult, but even enough I am hurt by her, I cannot justify leaving her with him. I know I probably won‚Äôt be able to convince her that she is in an abusive marriage and deserves better but I want her to know that if she ever decided she wanted to leave, I am in her court and I will do what I can to help her. 

Do I take her out to coffee right before I move and try to get through to her? Do I write her a letter? If anyone has done something remotely similar I would really appreciate your wisdom. 

Ultimately I am really scared for the next few weeks and I don‚Äôt know if I have it in me but I know that I can‚Äôt stay here. Any advice re: moving, no contact, or literally anything at all would make me feel slightly less terrified lol. Thank you ",3,1729543372.0,narcissisticparents,4,1.0,False

I haven't been tattooed by him before. The tattoo took 2 days. The first day he behaved professionally or rather respectfully. No nicknames, no sexual or intense vibes. He did half of the tattoo (took 6 hours) and we agreed to finish the rest a few days after. 

When the second and last day came he behaved completely differently. During these 6 hours he could not stop staring at me intensely and smiling. He knows my full name, but he still chooses to call me ""honey"" when he talks to me during the tattooing process. I asked about his age, to which he says he is 26 years old. And then he asks about my age, to which I say that I am 22 years old. He then says ""What do you think of my age? Is 26 too old for you?"". I then say no and that ""26 is a good age."". He blushes, becomes shy during the whole process. He makes excuses to maintain body contact with me during the tattoo. For example, bumping his hand into mine, or putting his own on mine, but in a sly way. At first he would put his airpods in and listen to music during the tattooing process and wouldn't take them out to talk to me when I asked him about it. But on the second day he chose not to listen to music and just talk to me for 6 hours. Every time I talk to him he turns completely red and shy, smiles and stares intensely into my eyes endlessly without blinking. He literally gives me ""fuck me eyes"" sorry for the expression üò≠ And constantly leans close to me when we talk, so that there are only a few centimeters between us. He asks me through the process ""How do you feel? Do you feel pain? Are you in pain?"" with a slightly sexual facial expression. When I say it hurts, he pushes harder and harder, like he's enjoying it. He acts caring and asks (about 15 times) if he should bring me water or coffee, and leans in all the time when he walks up to me. When he speaks to other guests, his voice is normal. But when he speaks to me, his voice becomes seductive, intimate and erotic. I felt a sexual and intimate connection with him. Every time he applies cream to my tattoo, he rubs intensely everywhere for a full 15 minutes each time. 15 minutes each time to apply cream to just one side of my forearm? (my arm is thin and small lmao). 

When we finished the tattoo and we had to say goodbye he walked up to me, took my hand and kept shaking it. And turned red and shy again. We agreed that he should complete my arm with colors (it is now only black and grey). But he is going back to his country in a week and a half. And he only comes back to my country again to tattoo after 2 months. 

He promised me when he tattooed me (on Friday) to give me a cream to put on my tattoo. But when I got home I realized he forgot to give me the cream. Whether it was on purpose or not I don't know. So now I have to go back to get the cream from him. I wrote to him on Instagram (we've written together before about the tattoo) that he forgot to give me the cream. He says I have to come back in 3 days and pick it up. I ask what time of day is better for him that I come by and pick up the cream. And then it says on Instagram that he has read my message, but left me on read. (He constantly posts stories and is online most of the time. Especially after my message, he posted 20+ stories). So now I don't know if I should just show up randomly to get the cream, what if he's not there at the time, or busy with another tattoo?

And what does his behavior mean? Why is he caring and flirty face to face but ignores my messages on Instagram and gives me the cold shoulder? (not the first time I've been ignored by him online). It's so confusing.

The gift was well received by the barista thanks to the savvy counsel I received here! I told her they could hang it in the coffee house if she was uncomfortable accepting it. Her response, ""what, no, I want it!"" She was visibly excited and thanked me multiple times. Her reaction made me feel good and glad I took a chance.

Thanks again for all the input and  different perspectives shared.

Original post TDLR: 56M switched coffee shops after a divorce. A kind barista, also a struggling artist, has been friendly and even gave him her number to send pictures from his trip to Mexico. He sent her a picture of a painting she loved, and now he's considering buying it for her. He's wondering if gifting it would be weird or overstepping and needs advice before deciding, as he's heading home soon.

Advice ranged from purchase and gift it to this is too much, and you run the risk of coming off as creepy, buy a regular souvenir.

He's on the autism spectrum and has got ADHD as well. I have ADHD, dyspraxia and dyscalculia with major mental health issues.

We've lived together for 5 months now and the honeymoon phase has more or less subsided. We had a massive argument today about cleaning the house.

I've always been very messy and disorganised and I have a lot of stuff in relatively small flat. I've never really been bothered by mess and with my previous housemates I had issues regarding that. I just can't see mess and even when I do, it doesn't bother me or I don't have the mental or physical capacity at the minute to tidy up. That's one big reason why I moved to a flat on my own.

Now my boyfriend has moved in and if I can't see most mess, he's totally blind to it! And he's even more messy than I am. The situation in my flat has escalated to the point where we have maggots crawling on the kitchen floor. Absolutely disgusting! 

The dishes have piled up, the recycling pile is taller than I am, there's empty bottles and boxes everywhere, dirty laundry all over the floor, kitchen counters are a disaster, cat hair everywhere, human hair everywhere, no room on the coffee table, the bathroom is in a state. Just trash everywhere!

We agreed that his task would be to do the dishes and take the bins out and I would do pretty much everything else as I work from home. But he hasn't done the dishes fully now for weeks. The other day he told me to let him know when the bin is full.

Couple days ago I said to him that we need to talk about cleaning. His response was ""there's no point talking about it, we just need to do it"". 
I try my best on picking up trash and keeping up with laundry for both of us, but I struggle. I suggested we make a list of tasks and get the most of this mess sorted and then we should hire a cleaner who'd come over once a week to maintain the cleaning. He said there's no need for either of those cause ""we just need to do it"".

Today I snapped and started the argument after I had to pick up our shopping. I felt like I have to do every little and big thing in the household. I've also been paying all our bills since he's lived here as he was unemployed until this past month. Now that he's working, he says that he needs to relax and rewind from the day of work he's done. So he's not doing the dishes even on his days off.
I told him how exhausting it is for me to do all the mental labour of trying to notice things and then ask him constantly to do simple things for us. Like, I have to tell him when the bin is full and to take it out as he can't see it himself (and even when I do that, he usually forgets to take them out when he leaves for work).
He said that clearly I don't have an ounce of understanding how he struggles with his autism and ADHD. I told him that I'm mentally exhausted and that I'm miserable in this flat right now. Even I don't know where to start with cleaning this place!

I feel hurt that he thinks I don't understand, even though I struggle with exact same things. I said to him that he could learn to notice these things, that's what I've had to do too. But he stopped talking and shut me out after that.

So am I the asshole for asking him to step up here?",0,1729542247.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

Fast forward a few months and I reached out to her saying I‚Äôd like to cry and continue. I‚Äôm busy too but I enjoyed the time. I figured it was worth a shot and honestly was shocked when she said ‚Äúyeah we can see each other again‚Äù. I offered Sunday morning, but she couldn‚Äôt make that so she rescheduled to Sunday at 5

I‚Äôm ok with that, and I had a great idea to get coffee and watch a sunset. I told her to push back meeting to 515 because ‚ÄúI have a plan‚Äù, and she told me ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs ur plan because I have work at 6‚Äù

Keep in mind she already had work from 11-4 that day (hence why she rescheduled) and then from 6-11 she was busy as well (between work and her sorority). 

My brain was like ‚Äúwhy would you agree to meet Sunday when you have no time?‚Äù I told her that I had no clue what to do at that point. I want to see her but she‚Äôs being overburdened and while I want to be part of her life that relieves stress I don‚Äôt know her schedule at all and it‚Äôs very difficult to make plans if I‚Äôm just playing a guessing game

She then sent me‚Äúhow about we reschedule for another day and I‚Äôll tell you my schedule and everything? I appreciate you a lot Ik this is annoying and I‚Äôm sorry about that‚Äù. I asked her if she was willing to do a quick phone call at 11 that last nifht, to which I got no response. This morning (I think) I messaged her saying ‚Äúyo lmk what ur schedule is looking like, it‚Äôs gonna work trust üò§‚Äù (or something like that) and I haven‚Äôt gotten a response yet

I talked to my friend and he said she‚Äôs leading me on and bread-crumbing. She‚Äôs given me a lot of signs she does want something (telling me she wants this to become something, saying yes to dates, and even telling me she appreciates me), but her actions haven‚Äôt been making an impact and they‚Äôre empty words. He mentioned she‚Äôs putting a complete lack of effort, saying that his sisters boyfriend works 3 jobs and is in school and has still managed to find time to meet up, and that he honestly hasn‚Äôt found a logical excuse for her actions solely through our text conversations. 

A big ‚Äúif she wanted to she would‚Äù, basically recognizing she is very busy but the fact she couldn‚Äôt even respond to my message asking for a FaceTime was damning since he could ‚Äúgaruntee she was free then‚Äù

He also noted me telling her I wanted a conversation about our communication and how she said ‚Äúdw I‚Äôll be upfront and honest‚Äù while sending actions that that statement was a complete lie (telling me she wants to meet up but then giving me times where it would legit be impossible, and not making time when she is free to meet too)

This is my first time talking to a girl, and I honestly really don‚Äôt want to believe him. But unfortunately he hasn‚Äôt given me a reason to not trust him while she has given me multiple reasons to not trust her.

I genuinely just want to know what happened because this crap is so tiring and I honestly don‚Äôt know how lenient and understanding I can be before my frustrations blow up in the worst way",1,1729541903.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

**GENDER:** MALE  
**HEIGHT:** 5'11  
**WEIGHT:** 143kg  
  
Hi all, I've been observing the posts here and they've very much helped to keep me on track with my diet, seeing the results of their journey from people. I'm an overweight guy, who's attachment to food and eating has left him generally unfit. I'll eat when I'm sad, when I'm bored... I've found intermittent fasting so far has helped me take control over those feelings. I'm posting in mind to find advice from others who have walked this lifestyle for the first time in hopes for a physical change, however I fear my mentality with food has changed instead and perhaps not for the best.

I'm two weeks into intermittent fasting doing 18:6 - So far it's been successful, starting with trial and error before I got to grasp with easier ways of making these changes to my life; Mostly with using Apps to track my eating/fasting window, to count my calories so I'm in a calorie deficit. I've aimed for 1,200 Calories in during the day, which is usually achieved with lunch, a low-calorie snack and dinner, and nothing else except black coffee to nip at those cravings in the night.

I break my fast with my college lunch break, about 12:30 in the day - My fasts usually end 10:30 by the time it's over, and I've found pushing myself another two hours is something I'm proud of accomplishing. When leaving college, I have dinner shortly after, around 3PM-4PM, and start my next fast. Is this too early, when I'm not eating until 12:30PM the following day?

My goal isn't really as much of a goal, as it is more of an idea of seeing myself slimmer. I don't weigh myself, and I don't have much of an idea which weight would be something to strive for - I suppose I'm just hoping to see where it goes over the next few months physically, even it at the best of times it's difficult to summon any hope that this process will lead to that change. But those are just little doubts I try bat away.

I wanted to come here, in a community I've been silently following, and interact with it for the first time! I suppose then, my question would be, how did you retain a **healthy** relationship with food while going through your journey? Currently when I eat, I don't take as much pleasure in it - Quite the opposite. I feel bad about doing it, and I worry now those emotions are replacing my previous but at the opposite end of the spectrum.

Infact tonight, I broke my fast at the encouragment of my family to eat something, as I began far too early in the day to keep me saciated and feeling happy - And doing that, well, it made me devistated... and I don't think I should be feeling that? I'm not sure what to feel with approaching this change in mindset.

How do I **do** intermittent fasting, and also maintain a healthy relationship with eating? Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts and worries, any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",1,1729541738.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False

I was watching a video the other day and someone noted that they were in a converted van, they had full electrical, but they had their burner as propane instead of electrical. Their reasoning was two-fold -- why use up their precious wattage if they were off-grid and it gave them an alternate cooking option if their electrical was out. 

Which got me wondering? How do people choose which instrument to use for cooking over others? What even are the variables? I'm assuming that whatever I get will have enough electrical to run a fridge, freezer and microwave. I'd love a small oven, but can get by without, and I'm flexible on propane or electrical burner, although I always assumed electrical. I want indoor cooking, not outdoor, if that matters.

Hence the question. If you were doing something like heating water for a simple Cup O' Noodles / Mr. Noodles, would you:

a. Put a kettle or pot on a propane burner and save your electrical?

b. Plug in an electric kettle, as you would ensure you had plenty of electrical to spare?

c. Nuke it in a microwave, again as you have electrical to spare?

Do people even USE electric kettles, or toasters, etc.? or is that too much draw for the electrical? Obviously, the right answer will be to use whatever you have, but assuming you have all three choices, what variables make you choose to use one over the other? I see lots of people showing off coffee options, but little explanation of why they went with what they did other than size...

I'm not sure I'm describing the question well enough, any and all views welcome.
