And I'm struggling to make the same cup with the same coffee taste the same on a day to day basis. Or even twice in the same day. Once the coffee will have a drawdown time of 2 minutes 30. And in the afternoon it will be nearly four minutes, where I did everything the exact same as in the morning. It sucks because I'm paying good money for excellent single origin light roast specialty coffee.

I've tried so much and can't seem to figure out what I'm doing wrong.

* I get my beans at a local roaster in town that is known all across Europe, regularly featuring in magazines and winning awards
* I grind my beans at home with my Baratza Encore. Usually on 20 (right down the middle) but sometimes 22-24. I rarely go lower than 20.
* I almost always use filtered tap water, filtered with a Brita.
* I use the Hario V60 filters in the cardboard box (the ones from the Japanese factory)
* I use a 1:16 ratio, usually that translates to 20 grams of coffee to 320 grams of water or 15 grams of coffee to 250 grams of water.
* I use a kettle which monitors and maintains the temperature chosen. I can choose between 40¬∞C, 80¬∞C, 90¬∞C and boiling. I always go for 90¬∞C.
* I bloom the grounds for 45 seconds with about 50-60 grams of water. Followed by a main pour just over 200 grams, wait 15 seconds and then pour the rest (I also have big issues with grounds that are sticking to the filter paper)
* After brewing, I swirl my brewer to destratify the coffee.

One day, the coffee tastes exactly the way I want it. Not too big on the bitters but clean, bright and more acidic than bitter. The day after, it's the other way around, even though I use the same coffee and method.

Am I still doing something wrong? Is there something I'm missing? What is causing me to be so inconsistent? Or is that inherent to pourover brewing?",1,1737238067.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

My dog‚Äôs name is Pinot, he is 3 years old and he is (literally) the center of my universe.

Yesterday, I noticed he yelped when playing and again when I picked him up but today he is totally fine. We took him to a coffee shop and petsmart, he was acting like himself no yelps! I was thinking about bringing him back to the vet to get an X-ray (we didn‚Äôt the first time because they didn‚Äôt think it was totally necessary). I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences? I‚Äôm scared he may have arthritis or something like that but he‚Äôs only 3.

As background, our coffee station is entire employee funded.  We have a Nespresso machine at work and a very old fashioned drip machine that seems to always break.  In addition I'm severely allergic to hazelnuts and someone at work keeps using hazelnut pods in the Nespresso machine and I'm tired of having to use an epipen at work.  I refuse to bring in good quality coffee for the office machine as people have a tendency to forget to put the lid on the coffee canister or make basically mud with massive amounts of coffee grounds in the machine.  Sometimes I'll start a pot of coffee and go back to my desk while it's brewing and return and find it empty as everyone else has taken a cup. I'd rather just do a pour over for myself with a smaller carafe.

I‚Äôm a 32yo guy from Southern California (San Diego, to be specific) looking to connect with fellow travel lovers who are interested in building something for the long-haul.

My primary interest is finding a long-term relationship, but I‚Äôd like to start by building a solid friendship as I am definitely one of those hopeless romantics that wants to end up with his best friend. While I‚Äôve never been in a rush to find my forever person, I will admit that as time goes by, nothing sounds better than finally finding that lasting relationship where we are true partners and will always be there to ride shotgun for each other through the crazy journey that is life.

**About Me:**

* [**Appearance**](https://imgur.com/a/iIR98R6): 5‚Äô7‚Äù, half-white/half-latino, tan skin, brown eyes, curly black hair, wear glasses, have a couple tattoos, and a little extra roundness around the belly area (though I'm actively working on it).
* **Personality**: I would describe myself as an extroverted introvert. I tend to be more reserved (especially when I first meet someone), and definitely need some alone time, but I genuinely enjoy being around people. Being self-aware is important to me and I‚Äôm always trying to better myself in some way or another. I would generally describe myself as an eternal optimist, caring and people-oriented, but also very driven, ambitious and have a lot that I'd like to do in my life. I don't smoke or partake in any drugs, and generally will only drink in social settings. I‚Äôm an INFJ, Sagittarius, and Ravenclaw if you‚Äôre into any of those things. My top love languages are quality time, words of affirmation, and acts of service.
* **Career**: I have a great work-from-home job at a large public health nonprofit, serving cancer patients specifically. Giving back and helping people (even in small ways) are things I‚Äôm very passionate about, so it would be great if my future partner cared about those things as well. Extra points if you also work in a ‚Äúdo-gooder‚Äù field like health, education, nonprofits, etc.¬†
* **Interests**: I love spending quality time with the people in my life, whether that be during a cozy night at home or on our next whirlwind travel adventure. Traveling is definitely one of my passions. I have a laundry list of places I‚Äôd love to visit around the globe and also have a goal of seeing all 63 of the U.S. National Parks (road trip, anyone?). Also have a soft spot for cultural activities like visiting museums, live theatre productions, and am looking to try going to more concerts this year.¬† I am also a bit of a foodie, and love trying new restaurants or finding a great local bakery, and will definitely go out of my way for a good cup of coffee.

**What I‚Äôm Looking For:**

* A woman near my age, preferably within 5 years of me in either direction (27 - 37 years old). But I‚Äôm open to someone outside that range if we otherwise have a lot in common.
* Someone who shares similar interests to those I mentioned above. A big must is someone who loves to travel and would gladly race me to the car as we head out for a spontaneous weekend trip. I‚Äôm always open to trying and learning about new things, so I look forward to supporting my partner‚Äôs interests as well.¬†
* A partner who is similarly goal-oriented, who genuinely cares about others, is passionate about the things they invest their time in (whether that be your career, community, relationships, etc.), but who also just likes to have fun, wants to spend time together no matter what we‚Äôre doing, and will indulge my late night taco cravings.
* I don‚Äôt really have a preference for physical characteristics as I would gladly choose a good heart and shared interests over anything else. But I realize that mutual attraction is still important, so I hope you‚Äôd be comfortable exchanging photos once we‚Äôve gotten to know each other a bit (link to my photos are above).
* I‚Äôm open to you being located anywhere in the US, but please have the ability and interest to eventually meet in-person if we were to really hit it off.
* Please also have an end goal of building towards a long-term, committed, and monogamous relationship. While I‚Äôm not in any rush, I would eventually like to build a life together, whether that be here on the West Coast, wherever you are, or maybe even somewhere new for the both of us.

I know I‚Äôve written a lot, but at the end of the day, I‚Äôm really just looking for a good person that I can be myself around (and vice-versa) who wants to make amazing memories and build a comfortable life together. Fingers crossed that could be you!",1,1737237674.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1i4ilib,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1i4ilib/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

If I don‚Äôt drink coffee, I will probably be asleep by 11 pm and have vivid dreams and Deep sleep.

If I drink even one I struggle to sleep and end up sleeping at around 1 am and remember barely any dreams and don‚Äôt feel well rested in the morning.

So I‚Äôve been wondering why this happens. 

Caffeine has a half life from 6-9 hours which means in 12 hours to 18 hours, you will still have half of the amount of caffeine you consumed. 

The way adenosine triggers sleep, is that it accumulates through the entire day until it reaches a point to make you sleep.

But if you block this accumulation with a high dose of caffeine, instead of having that accumulation kick off at let‚Äôs say 9 am, it will start at 5 pm.

And by the time you need to go to bed you won‚Äôt have enough.

I‚Äôm a 32yo guy from Southern California (San Diego, to be specific) looking to connect with fellow travel lovers who are interested in building something for the long-haul.

My primary interest is finding a long-term relationship, but I‚Äôd like to start by building a solid friendship as I am definitely one of those hopeless romantics that wants to end up with his best friend. While I‚Äôve never been in a rush to find my forever person, I will admit that as time goes by, nothing sounds better than finally finding that lasting relationship where we are true partners and will always be there to ride shotgun for each other through the crazy journey that is life.

**About Me:**

* [**Appearance**](https://imgur.com/a/iIR98R6): 5‚Äô7‚Äù, half-white/half-latino, tan skin, brown eyes, curly black hair, wear glasses, have a couple tattoos, and a little extra roundness around the belly area (though I'm actively working on it).
* **Personality**: I would describe myself as an extroverted introvert. I tend to be more reserved (especially when I first meet someone), and definitely need some alone time, but I genuinely enjoy being around people. Being self-aware is important to me and I‚Äôm always trying to better myself in some way or another. I would generally describe myself as an eternal optimist, caring and people-oriented, but also very driven, ambitious and have a lot that I'd like to do in my life. I don't smoke or partake in any drugs, and generally will only drink in social settings. I‚Äôm an INFJ, Sagittarius, and Ravenclaw if you‚Äôre into any of those things. My top love languages are quality time, words of affirmation, and acts of service.
* **Career**: I have a great work-from-home job at a large public health nonprofit, serving cancer patients specifically. Giving back and helping people (even in small ways) are things I‚Äôm very passionate about, so it would be great if my future partner cared about those things as well. Extra points if you also work in a ‚Äúdo-gooder‚Äù field like health, education, nonprofits, etc.¬†
* **Interests**: I love spending quality time with the people in my life, whether that be during a cozy night at home or on our next whirlwind travel adventure. Traveling is definitely one of my passions. I have a laundry list of places I‚Äôd love to visit around the globe and also have a goal of seeing all 63 of the U.S. National Parks (road trip, anyone?). Also have a soft spot for cultural activities like visiting museums, live theatre productions, and am looking to try going to more concerts this year.¬† I am also a bit of a foodie, and love trying new restaurants or finding a great local bakery, and will definitely go out of my way for a good cup of coffee.

**What I‚Äôm Looking For:**

* A woman near my age, preferably within 5 years of me in either direction (27 - 37 years old). But I‚Äôm open to someone outside that range if we otherwise have a lot in common.
* Someone who shares similar interests to those I mentioned above. A big must is someone who loves to travel and would gladly race me to the car as we head out for a spontaneous weekend trip. I‚Äôm always open to trying and learning about new things, so I look forward to supporting my partner‚Äôs interests as well.¬†
* A partner who is similarly goal-oriented, who genuinely cares about others, is passionate about the things they invest their time in (whether that be your career, community, relationships, etc.), but who also just likes to have fun, wants to spend time together no matter what we‚Äôre doing, and will indulge my late night taco cravings.
* I don‚Äôt really have a preference for physical characteristics as I would gladly choose a good heart and shared interests over anything else. But I realize that mutual attraction is still important, so I hope you‚Äôd be comfortable exchanging photos once we‚Äôve gotten to know each other a bit (link to my photos are above).
* I‚Äôm open to you being located anywhere in the US, but please have the ability and interest to eventually meet in-person if we were to really hit it off.
* Please also have an end goal of building towards a long-term, committed, and monogamous relationship. While I‚Äôm not in any rush, I would eventually like to build a life together, whether that be here on the West Coast, wherever you are, or maybe even somewhere new for the both of us.

I know I‚Äôve written a lot, but at the end of the day, I‚Äôm really just looking for a good person that I can be myself around (and vice-versa) who wants to make amazing memories and build a comfortable life together.

1i4ih5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i4ih5j/sp_dormant/,[SP] Dormant,"On the 22nd floor of a gleaming skyscraper, the floor-to-ceiling windows brightened just as Dan‚Äôs first morning meeting concluded. His schedule was back-to-back meetings, so he beckoned for Sienna to get a fresh cup of coffee. As he looked at his calendar, he gestured for Sienna to wait a moment.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the forecast today?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a steep drop starting in the early afternoon, the city has issued a freeze-in curfew today.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, can you let my wife know to meet me in the underground for lunch? The usual fake-fish sushi place, with the skylight.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'll let her know‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôll send in your next meeting.‚Äù

As Dan adjusted his waistband thinking about lunch, one of his newest analysts hopped into the chair across from his desk. Mark, the fresh recruit, was a young man in his 20‚Äôs and adequately hungry for a taste of the private equity world.

The blistering wind frosted the steel mullions, but the crackling did not agitate Mark.

‚ÄúBoss, I gotta ask, has Canada always been like this? Are the freeze-ins normal?‚Äù	

‚ÄúSpoken like a true immigrant‚Ä¶ no, they started around 30 years ago. At first, it was every few years. Gradually, it started to happen every winter‚Äù, Dan gestured with a winding wrist towards the sprawl. ‚ÄúIt was not so extreme or cold either, it became deadly about a decade ago. The first bad freeze got rid of our homeless problem, because it came without warning. The second one killed some rich kids, so now, we have the climate AI to predict it. That same data architecture is used to power the assets in our acquisition, do you see where I‚Äôm going here?‚Äù

A frenzied gust of southerly wind buffeted the building, but Dan was unfazed. Trying to mirror his mentor‚Äôs composure, Mark imagined an unseen, hairline crack in the building facade.

‚ÄúIf we acquire the ability to draw data from Helios‚Äôs remote imaging systems, we can leverage it for our agri-holdings. Alvin and I have been able to verify their claims in thawing vast tracts of frozen land to arable land using their satellite network. The technology is sound and elegant; the array of suborbital mirrors is feasible. In speaking with the Helios board, 95% of them have approved our intent to acquire. They have nominal outstanding debt and liabilities, and they are willing to sell at‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm late‚Ä¶.‚Äù, Alvin stumbled into Dan‚Äôs office with Sienna in tow.

‚ÄúYour wife confirmed‚Äù, Sienna set the fresh coffee in front of Dan and left, closing the door.

‚ÄúHow was your little field trip? You look‚Ä¶ tired‚Äù, Dan said to Alvin as he fumbled his folders around. Alvin‚Äôs eyes were pink from all the driving and flying.

‚ÄúAlvin, I was just catching Dan up on our due diligence. Tell us about your trip to the test fields, were you able to get an independent ecological assessment on viability?""

‚ÄúI did get to verify with an ecologist and the local farmers association on its viability. Everything looks to be in order for the deal to pull through‚Ä¶‚Äù, Alvin paused for a moment and juggled a thought.

Dan sensed hesitancy, ‚ÄúSay more.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, there was a mass casualty event that may or may not be related.‚Äù	

‚ÄúHow is that possible? We‚Äôre looking at acquiring satellites, what does that have to do with casualties on land?‚Äù Mark asked.

‚ÄúIt appeared to be  the nearest township to the test area, the thawed edge was about 10 kilometers from the town center. Three days after the test, all 49 residents were found dead and naked outside, flash frozen. The coroner confirmed that they all froze to death. What‚Äôs strange is that it looked like they rushed out of their homes all at once, at about the same time of the last freeze. Some victims even shattered through their own windows trying to get out.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds like an odd tragedy, but I‚Äôm not seeing the relevance to this acquisition‚Ä¶‚Äù	

‚ÄúI asked the ecologist what she thought and she said something that might tank this deal. She thinks it has to do with thawing the ground indiscriminately. Apparently, the frozen soil can harbor old, old viruses, like ancient and primordial species. When Helios thawed the land, they may have unearthed something that infected the town.‚Äù

‚ÄúWHOA, whoa, whoa, we don‚Äôt know this; that is speculation! What is she? The ecologist? She‚Äôs not a virologist, like you said, she doesn't know this for sure‚Äù, Mark was caught flat-footed.

‚ÄúI know how this sounds. I was very concerned at first, but the local authorities seemed to think this is more superstition than anything biological. They have no reason to believe or even suspect that the deaths are related to the Helios tests.‚Äù

Dan turned to the window and stared out to the expanse of his city that was bracing for the afternoon freeze. The winter sun had cleared the fogged edges on the windows; a harsh zinc light sliced across Dan‚Äôs office.

‚ÄúGive your phones to Sienna outside and come back‚Äù, Dan said without turning.

When the two returned, Dan was sipping on his black coffee.

‚ÄúHave you two ever had cow‚Äôs milk? And I‚Äôm not talking about synthetic milk proteins‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm talking about real milk, *not* from a lab.‚Äù

The two shook their heads.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think so,‚Äù Dan put down his mug, ‚ÄúWe are on the cusp of our agricultural revolution in Canada; this technology can unlock arable land the size of the Albertan Republic. This can remake our country into a superpower, and *we* can be the first to have real *fucking* food again in half a century. If we play this right, we also have the added benefit of being stupid-*fucking* rich!...‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Alvin interrupted.	

‚ÄúI want you two to get this deal done, take it to the finish line. Don‚Äôt squander the opportunity because some nut-bag scientist thinks there‚Äôs a new coronavirus. Come back when you have all the filings ready for me to review.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy that‚Äù, Mark saluted as Alvin sulked to the elevator.



In the 20th floor pantry, Alvin looked out the window flanked by countertops of cloned coffee cartons and stainless steel appliances. Hunched and hushed, Alvin dialed Dr. DeForest.

‚ÄúDr. DeForest, Erica,.... This is Alvin from last week. I need to ask, do you have any updates on that sample?‚Äù

‚ÄúHi Alvin, I do. It is an unknown virus to my knowledge. I can‚Äôt say for sure‚Ä¶ but the samples we took seem to behave aggressively when the ambient temperature is *cold,* like below freezing. The viral behavior is like an extremophile‚Ä¶ I have no reason to believe it kills by hemorrhaging its host but I do have a theory on what may have happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is your theory?‚Äù	‚ÄúThis is all speculative, please understand that, but I think the virus can incubate in a host and hide in the spinal column‚Ä¶ like chicken pox. When the right conditions are met, the virus can reactivate. I think this virus might be provoking the immune system to trigger a runaway fever to overheat the host body. The host, unable to kill the virus, finds the colder temperatures to cool off. I think that is how they all died in that town, Alvin. The virus survives by boiling internally and then freezing them; they thrive because their goal is to *become* inactive. It‚Äôs quite elegant...""

‚ÄúPlease, I just need to know how transmissible it is‚Ä¶‚Äù	

‚ÄúImpossible to know for sure now, but if I were you, I would stay away from Helios. They have no environmental compliance or oversight, no regulatory obligation. This is an ecological and pandemic-level disaster waiting to happen.‚Äù

‚ÄúI need to think ‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôll call you back‚Äù, Alvin started to hyperventilate and bolted to the restroom. Trying to catch his shallow breaths, Alvin threw his arms above his head and pulled at his unwashed hair. He paced the bathroom in circles until he could no longer walk straight. In the throes of panic, he pressed his forehead on the floor-to-ceiling glass and looked out to the city. He thought about the people that might get infected and die if the deal went through. If he refuses, then another ambitious person will just close the deal and chance the virus anyway. With each breath Alvin took, the glass and mirrors in the restroom got foggier and foggier; he slumped in the inescapable box of his company‚Äôs making.



Transfixed to the constant influx of emails on his phone, Dan descended to the subfloor to meet his wife for lunch. His corporate eyes screened two to three emails at a time.

‚Äú*DING! Beware and be aware, our city‚Äôs mandatory freeze-in curfew is in effect. Remaining outdoors between now and midnight may result in loss of limbs and or death. Stay warm together indoors and underground. This message is brought to you by the Office of Emergency Management. DING!‚Äù*

Dan stepped off the elevator into the underground concourse lined with shops and food vendors. As he marched his thick-heeled dress shoes across the travertine, his presence was registered by fellow managing directors on their lunch outings. The clumping alerted his wife who had stood waiting for him underneath their familiar skylight as they had ritually done. When he saw her, he began to trot, eager to break his day's doldrum.

As he reached the skylight, a shadowy-figure shot through with a whipping force. An icy mortar struck his wife while frost-licked shards of glass hailed all around her. The sickening impact had caved her head into her torso and buckled her joints like a juicy marionette. The second sensation Dan felt was a ferocious cold that made his eyes glassy. Slippery chunks of flesh rolled out from the impact and dispersed limps all around.

Dan did not hear the screams, nor did he heed the warnings to evacuate. In the chaos, an oblong ice ball skid from the carnage to his trembling feet. When it tumbled to a stop, Dan saw Alvin‚Äôs beady red eyes inside a dented, disembodied head.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. Right now I've been playing around with some watercolors. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

I‚Äôm CharmedCynic, a 30-year-old Japanese-American (second generation/""nisei"") woman living in Stamford, Connecticut, working as a middle school math tutor. Education and teaching light up my world, and I can‚Äôt wait to continue growing in this rewarding field.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù with deep brown almond-shaped eyes, medium-length dark brown hair, two pierced ears, and three tattoos (a rose on my upper right shoulder, a bluebird on my right hand, and a lilac on my left forearm). My style blends classic and artistic‚Äîmodern yet timeless, just like my personality.

I enjoy life‚Äôs simple pleasures: sipping a cranberry vodka or gin and tonic while soaking in city lights, or sharing a good laugh over coffee and cake. I prefer quiet moments to loud parties and meaningful conversations over shallow chatter. Politically moderate and non-religious, I live a balanced life and aim to stay grounded.

So, why am I here, especially on Reddit, when there are so many dating apps? Glad you asked! It‚Äôs because Reddit feels more authentic than those apps. You know the drill, right? You meet someone, go on a date, and then realize it just doesn‚Äôt click. And afterward, there‚Äôs that empty feeling that lingers. Maybe they talk over you when they're drunk, dominate the conversation, or even ghost you with no explanation. And before you know it, you‚Äôve deleted the app, reinstalled it, and started the cycle all over again.

Well, I‚Äôm here to help you break that cycle. If you choose to respond to this post, you might just be putting an end to the repetitive dating app grind‚Äîfor good. What I‚Äôm looking for is an old-fashioned romance. The kind where you go on actual dates, where you‚Äôre picked up at your place and the date never takes place at their home. I want to go somewhere out in public, somewhere with a cash register. It‚Äôs about creating memories in real-life settings, not just online or in someone‚Äôs living room.

When I‚Äôm not working, you‚Äôll find me writing, drawing, listening to synthwave, or indulging in nostalgic 80s/90s films. I‚Äôm a die-hard fan of the original *Gossip Girl* (2007‚Äîno reboot, please!) and would love a partner who‚Äôs down to binge it with me. My favorite films include *Dogfight*, *Cruel Intentions*, *Stand By Me*, *Career Opportunities*, *Secret Admirer*, and *The Bling Ring*. My playlists are filled with dreamy tracks like ‚ÄúSunset‚Äù by The Midnight, ‚ÄúSummer Eyes‚Äù by Coastal, and ‚ÄúMiracle Love‚Äù by Lazer Club.

While I value my independence, I‚Äôm ready to share my life with someone who feels like my best friend. I‚Äôm looking for a connection rooted in laughter, trust, and genuine care. I want us to be that couple who shares inside jokes, enjoys the small moments, and always has each other‚Äôs backs. Romantic moments are my favorite‚Äîthose quiet seconds when you lock eyes, smile, and know you‚Äôve found your person.

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**

* **Age Range:** 28-37
* **Height:** 5'10"" or taller
* **Build:** Slim/fit/lean
* **Lifestyle:** Drug-free (no molly, edibles, coke, etc.) with moderate drinking okay
* **Location:** Connecticut or within 25-35 miles, US/Canada preferred
* **Relationship Goals:** Long-term, monogamous, with marriage potential. Bonus points if you‚Äôre open to starting a family someday!

**A few non-negotiables:** You‚Äôre emotionally available, employed, stable, single, and not in touch with exes (I think it‚Äôs important that we‚Äôre both fully present). You communicate openly and value consistency‚Äîit‚Äôs the small, thoughtful texts and actions that mean the most to me.

If you‚Äôre kind, stable, and seeking a relationship filled with joy and mutual respect, I‚Äôd love to hear from you! Please include a photo in your message, and if we vibe, I‚Äôll happily share one back. Let‚Äôs see where this journey could take us! üíï",2,1737237169.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

My job responsibilities usually involve a lot of moving around and being on my feet. I am also frequently tasked with moving and lifting heavy things, whether it be bags of green coffee or shipments for our clients.

I have a complicated health history. I contracted a very serious case of tuberculosis while traveling abroad several years back. I received intense treatment for the illness but due to incomplete/improper treatments my illness developed a severe degree of drug-resistance. It also decided to hop around to other parts of my body amidst the poor treatment I received, so I‚Äôve had several reoccurring cases of TB in my reproductive tract. It‚Äôs been the worst and most painful experience of my life and I wish every day that I hadn‚Äôt traveled abroad as a college student.

While working two years back, I strained really hard to pick up a box on the ground and felt an immediate dragging sensation in my pelvic floor. I had it assessed a month later and discovered that I had a uterine prolapse. I discussed the situation with my doctors and they believed the prolapse was likely a combination of the intense stressing at work and the havoc the TB caused on my reproductive organs. They recommended that I see a pelvic floor PT and be fitted for a pessary, and I have done both things, which has greatly improved my discomfort and enabled me to continue working my job, which I love.

Well, I had another major problem this last Thursday. I was roasting coffee like usual and had to move a bag to get it off the floor and onto its end so I could scoop the coffee into a barrel for roasting. The bag was likely around 150lbs. When I went to lift it on its end, I lost my grip and it basically knocked me over and onto the ground. I hit my shoulder and head on the concrete and felt a horrific strain in my pelvic floor as I tried to get the bag off of me and get myself off the floor.

I have not been right since. I had immense improvement of my POP symptoms for months and I am now back to square one. I have had vaginal bleeding and difficulty passing urine for the last two days. I am unable to sleep at night and feel a pressure sensation in my abdomen. I have felt weak and lightheaded and have lost my appetite.

I went ahead and called my doctors and scheduled appointments to be seen, but I am wondering if I need to go to an ER prior to these appts, which aren‚Äôt until February. I am trying to remain calm and not jump to conclusions about it, but this is a new level of pain I have not experienced before. I would almost describe it as a stabbing, dragging pain that shifts with every move I make. Getting up and down from a chair, into and out of my bed, riding in the car, and generally living life has become unbearable in the last 48hrs.

Any advice as to what I can do in the meantime to ease my symptoms?

1i4hyp3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4hyp3,"Margaux 15, two versions","So last year I bought quite a few bags that were driving me crazy and it turned out pretty amazing.

One of those was the Margaux 15. I wanted her so bad lol (or the 17) but most of the sellers had it in +$300 which I wasn't paying at all, and at the same time I didn't wanted a PU bag so I had to do a ton of research.

But at the end it turned out pretty well! Both bags are from different sellers (one DHGate, one in AliExpress) but both are leather and smell amazing üò©. Also, hardware feels pretty good (sturdy and heavy), stitching is on point, finishes are great. 

First I bought the Brown/Burgundy in smooth leather, from DHGate. It arrived super well packed though the leather was moderately stiff at first, so I doubted for a minute. I haven't used leather conditioner yet but I've been massaging her, punching her, and it has worked pretty well hahaha now it's softer, but I realized that in the construction they added some kind of hard material to keep her structured. I also think the handles are longer than the original version but that's fine because I can carry her on my shoulder! The price was around $120 with shipping. 

The suede one that's like Mocha/Caramel is from AliExpress. This arrived horribly packed, super tight, no filling, nothing! so I had to fill it out and let it sit for a few days. This one smelled nasty at first but it dissipated like in 10 minutes. This one's super soft and after the strong smell, it smells so good! The price was around $143 with shipping after coupons.

I'm sad that there's no longer a link for the suede one since they had a really great dark and deep coffee color that I wanted so bad (I'm addicted to color brown).

I'm sharing it here because I think these were really nice finds and they're both beautiful bags! No, not exactly like the auth but in their own way and I love it.

1i4huat,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i4huat/one_good_man/,One Good Man,"The weather was lousy, and getting worse.  The blizzard had all the qualities that made winter what it was, cold, harsh gusting winds, snow and ice enough to force him to keep the trucks defroster on all the time.  Still he only had a small section of windshield to look out through.   He was grateful for the weight of the old camper setup he had secured to the truck bed behind him, it gave the rear wheels some purchase on the treacherous road.  A part of him wondered just what he was doing out here, in the middle of the night, on an empty highway rolling through the mountains, the nearest person the lonely gas station attendant he left twenty miles back.   He remembered the gas station and grunted, so much for local advice he thought.  He'd asked the attendant if the road would be passable in the storm, and got a nod and assurance that he'd make it ok.   Not that it mattered much, he'd be OK if he got stuck.  He'd retreat to the camper, where he had food and water, enough for a couple days, longer if he was cautious, and by then the highway would probably have been cleared, or the state police would be by, looking for people like him.  Other idiots, he thought.  He grunted in a sort of half laugh at his own summary.

He'd been looking down for a bag of some snack from the station, and he'd seen the girl just in time to avoid hitting her.  ""Aww Shit!"" he yelled, cranking the wheel over, the truck skidding in the snow, came to a stop canted across the highway.  Luckily his was the only vehicle out there.

He dug behind the seat, and found the old flashlight in his tool kit.  Pulled it out, amazingly it still worked.  He hit the hazard lights, and got out of the truck.  He started walking back toward where he'd seen her flash by, hoping he'd missed.  He was pretty sure he did, but damn, he was scared.

He found her hunched over in the cold, next to the road.  He was relieved she was still standing.  ""Are you OK?"" he asked, real concern in his voice.   As he got closer, he could see that she the clothes she was wearing were not enough to survive in this storm for long.  She was thin, to the point he'd have called her scrawny, her wet hair hanging down around her head, her arms clutching the thin jacket around her that was the only shelter she had from the elements.  As he got closer, he asked again, more gently, ""Are you alright?  Why are you out here alone on a night like this? ""  She looked up at him, her head not quiet coming upright,  she just stared at him.  He noticed she had dark eyes, and looked sunken, and tired.  ""You know you almost got killed?"" now he was getting a little angry, the fear and adrenaline not having any other use.   She flinched at that, more at the tone of his voice.  He calmed himself, he was getting cold, she must be almost frozen.  ""Lets get in the truck OK?""  he said.  She looked at him, her eyes grew wider, and she shook her head, just a short shake back and forth. She hunched a little more.  ""Look, you're in no shape to be out here, and I'm getting cold too.  Let's get in the truck, it'll be out of the wind, warm and dry.""  The short quick shake, again.  He thought, yea, I know kid.  Middle of the night strange old man in a beat up pickup truck, trying to get her into his truck.   Its a fine world we live in he thought.  

""Look"" he said, ""I promise, I won't hurt you.  Swear to God."" he said, ""lets just go get warm"".   She looked at him, hard, in a way that made him feel subtly uncomfortable.  He waited.  He was cold, but he'd be damned if he was going to let her freeze to death out here. Finally she nodded, another quick head motion,  He held out his hand, she took it, her hand approaching his like a timid bird,  Jesus he thought, she's as cold as ice.  He lead her back to his truck, still running in the middle of the highway.

He led her to the passenger side, opened the door and titled the seat forward.  He rummaged around and pulled out the old army blanket he kept back there,  He took her wet coat off and tossed it into the truck, he put the blanket around her shoulders, and helped her into the truck.   Closing the door he stomped through the snow to the drivers side.  He got in and shoved the heater controls to maximum.  He twisted the vent vanes so that the majority of the hot air was headed her way.  She had pushed herself into the corner of the cab, as far from him as she could.  He looked at her, sympathy and curiosity warring in his mind.

""Don't wrap the blanket around you all the away, leave the front open and let the hot air in to warm you, like a little tent."" he told her. She moved her arms towards the heater vents in the dashboard,  the blanket falling open.  She held her hands in front of the vents, warming them, as if over a fire.

""Are you hungry?"" he asked.  She looked at him, ""How about some water?"" he tried.  He flipped the dome light on, and rummaged around.  He had most of a water bottle left from the gas station.  He found it, and held it out to her. ""Sorry it's not full, but it's all I have""  She looked at it, then leaned towards him to take it.

Jesus Christ he thought, is she pregnant too?  The bulge of her stomach had been invisible in the dark blowing snow, and her hunched posture had helped conceal it.  She sipped the water, then drank thirstily.  He took this chance to really look her over.  She was rail thin, except for her midsection, where her belly bulged, her skin was very pale, He could see dark rings under her eyes, which were dark, brown maybe, he couldn't tell in the trucks lousy dome light.  Her hair was dark with wet, but he could see it was light in places,  Her ears poked out from between the drenched locks.  That's odd he thought, she noticed him looking and quickly adjusted her hair.  Self conscious he thought.  She had no piercings or tattoos that he could see, no jewelry.  Her clothes were thin, her stretchy leggings hung a little loose, her thin sneakers, were wet and warn, with no socks. The only nod to the weather was the ragged sweatshirt she was wearing, as thin as she was, it was still too small. As if she was wearing a child's size.  That and the light windbreaker was all she had had on to protect her from this kind of storm.  Crazy he though, absolutely crazy.

She drank the water, and seemed to relax slightly.  He thought he'd try again.

""How'd you get out here?"" he asked, ""did you go off the road?""  He hadn't seen any signs of a wreck, but if they'd slid off the road, in this weather, he'd may very well have missed any signs of it. She didn't look hurt, there was no blood, just wet and probably having hypothermia on top of shock.

""Do you have family near by?"" he tried a different tact.  At this point, he was mostly concerned with getting her someplace safe, where ever that might be in this wilderness. He could see that she was still very wary.

""Look"" he said, ""I am not going to hurt you, OK?""

This time she looked at him, and he heard, ""I know"".  Ah Good he thought! Something at last.  Her voice was soft, and he thought she had an accent.  Irish? He thought.  He hadn't heard that since he was a boy, listening his grandmother tell him stories, but hers was different yet familiar.

""I want to get you someplace safe"" he said. ""There was a gas station about twenty miles back, maybe a couple hours in this weather, but we can call your folks when we get there, and they can come get you.""  She shook her head.

""No"" she said, ""Not back there."" She shook her head, and her arms clamped around her, she drew back into the corner of the cab.

Jesus, he thought, what have I gotten myself into.  Something else came to his mind, about no good dead going unpunished.  He looked at her, trying to be as nonthreatening as possible.

""Are you in some kind of trouble?"" he asked.  It was looking like she was, and it was something really bad.  She looked at him for a long moment, he could see her eyes welling up, then her head dropped.

""Yes"" she said,  he couldn't see her face, but he could see her shoulders start to heave up and down, soft noises came.

Shit, he thought, Shit shit shit on horseback.   He was not very good at comforting, despite having been in relationships for most of his life,  a sucking chest wound he could deal with, a crying woman, and he was awkward at best.

""Hey, it's OK"" he said.  He reached over to try to embrace her on her shoulders.  She pulled away, so he placed his hand on her shoulder, trying to reassure her.  ""It's OK.  I won't hurt you, and I won't let anyone else hurt you either, OK?""   She still sobbed, falling over against his side. He held her in an awkward one armed embrace,  his face having a very, What-in-the-hell-do-I-do-now look on it.   He patted her back, and just kept telling her it was going to be OK.  Eventually she stopped sobbing.  He looked down, damn, she was out.  Sleeping.  He reached over and wrapped the blanked around her and a seat belt, not the best he thought, but better than nothing.  He shifted the truck into gear.

""If not back there"" he said to himself, ""then forward it is""  he straightened the truck and started making his way through the storm once again, driving as carefully as he could, more out of care not disturb his fragile passenger than for the storm raging outside.

As he drove, he'd look down at her occasionally. she slept the sleep of the utterly exhausted.  She was a pretty girl, he decided, but there was something he couldn't place that made her look just different enough that he had to work to see it.  He chalked it up to being exhausted, half starved, half frozen, and pregnant.   As she slept and he drove, one of her ears poked out from her hair.  He saw it, and got a good look, now that she wasn't awake to hide it.  A good look at her ear just added another question to the many that were running around in his head as he drove.  

Oh man, he thought, What have I gotten into?   He shrugged.  Not like he'd have to worry about consequences.  He laughed, quietly so as not to wake her. He looked at his exhausted, bedraggled passenger.  No, he decided.  He would help her, what ever it took, and that was that.  With that thought, he focused on driving through the storm, his mind quiet his decision granting him the peace of certainty, the only sounds the ones from the old truck laboring along in the storm, and the soft regular breathing of a very exhausted girl lying next to him.

She woke in a dim grey-white light. She was warm and mostly dry.  Suddenly the thing she was lying on moved.  She sat upright quickly.

""Good Morning"" he said.  He stretched a little, as much as he could in the confines of the truck.  Rubbed his face and looked at her.  He had a strange smile on his face. She considered him for a moment.  Memories of last night coming back.  He could tell that she had made some kind of decision just then.  He sat and waited patiently.  He figured she would talk when she was ready, and he wouldn't push.

""Good Morning"" she said.  His smile widened a bit.

""Where?"" she asked.

""Oh, about 10 or 15 miles past where we met."" he said. ""I got too tired and pulled over. The storm is still going on, but it's day light now at least.""

She nodded.  She groaned quietly and touched her stomach, the way she did it confirmed his theory from last night.  The gesture was probably universal.

""How far along are you?"" he asked.  She looked puzzled for a moment.  He had a fleeting thought that maybe she wasn't pregnant and he had just made a blunder.

""Not sure"" she said.  She placed her hands on either side, and stared at herself for a few moments, as if the answer was written there.

""Not sure"" she repeated, then ""Hungry?"" it was both a statement and a question. He nodded.

""I bet"" he said, ""Shall we retire to the dining room for breakfast?"" ha asked,  She simply looked confused, hopeful, but confused.  He shrugged.

""Follow me""  he got out of the truck,  there was a stomped down path to the back of the truck from when he'd gotten out to clear the exhaust so the carbon monoxide wouldn't put them to sleep for ever.  The snow was well above his knees outside the path he noted.

He cleared the snow with his boot, and kicked the step down.  He held the door open with a flourish, and pointed into the camper. She hesitated.

""Foods in there"" he said, with a nod.  She stepped up and in, and he followed.

""It's cold now,"" he said, "" but I'll get the heat running and the stove will help.  It'll be toasty warm in a bit.""  ""Have a seat"" he said, pointing the the foam cushion chairs next to the little table that served the camper as dining room and kitchen.

He opened the little camper fridge, and ask, ""So what'll it be?  bacon? Eggs? sausage? I have some milk, and maybe some cereal somewhere. Or oatmeal?""  He looked hopefully at her and waited for her answer.

""Eggs and Bacon"" she said, but it came out all one word, eggsnbacon.

""Eggcellent!"" he said, but she didn't seem to get  his attempt at humor.  Dad jokes, he thought, they can be an acquired taste.  He decided to go safe, he made scrambled eggs, and crispy bacon.  Some toast, he had butter and some jam.  Strawberry apparently when he found the jar.  As the bacon cooked, he got the coffee pot started too.  God knew he could use a cup, or two. 

He set out two plates, knifes and forks,  two cups.  He added one for her which he filled with milk, in case the coffee was too much.  He served up the food, sat and started eating.

After a few minutes, he paused.  She was staring at him, and not eating.

""Hmm,"" he said, wiping his lips, ""Sorry, I've been eating alone for so long I kinda forget about my manners and such.""   She looked at him. and picked up her fork, hesitantly.

""If the eggs and bacon are too much, start with the toast."" he suggested. He remembered the pregnancies he'd lived through, and how the appetite and stomach could be at war at times.

She picked up a slice of buttered toast, nibbled the corner, then ate it hungrily.  He nodded encouragingly.  Then she picked up the fork and started on the eggs.  She saw that he had taken the bacon and put it on the toast like a sandwich, and she followed suit.  for a time there was only the sounds of eating.

He was just sipping his second cup of coffee, she had finished eating and after having tried the hot black coffee, decided to drink the milk instead. 

""Well,"" he said, ""I cooked, I guess that means you clean up?"" she looked at him.  ""Ah, the sink is under this folding bit here"" he explained.  He demonstrated how it worked. Helped her gather the few dishes.  After a slow start, she got into it.  He wasn't being misogynistic, he believed that giving her some activity that brought some assemblance of normal life to her would help.  Besides, it would keep her busy while he took care of refilling the trucks fuel tank from the spare gas cans.   He hadn't burned much getting up here, but he'd rather keep fuel in the trucks tank, than in the spare cans.

""Save some hot water, and you can use the shower, after"" he recalled that most of the time the women in his life liked regular showers.  The camper had a cramped shower/toilet combination. It worked, even if it wasn't luxuriously appointed.  ""I'm going out to clear snow and see if we can get going again.""  He stepped out and closed the door.

The truck was on the side of the road.  The blizzard wind had drifted snow against one side, it had also scoured the middle of the highway down to pavement, while piling occasional drifts up in places.   He figured he could get back on the road, and make some miles, if he went slowly.  He cleared the drifts away from the truck, filled the tank, and went back inside.

She'd finished the dishes, and had put them away.  He nodded approvingly. ""Nice Job"" he said, he meant it.  She'd not only washed the dishes, but had straightened up, and cleaned a bit more.  The camper was actually presentable.  He figured he'd have to search for a few things, but it might be worth it.

""How about a shower?"" he asked.  She looked puzzled. ""You want to get cleaned up?""

""Like the dishes?"" she asked.

""Yes"" he laughed, but she looked at the sink, concerned.

""No, no, not in there"" he laughed again, ""In here"" he opened the small closet/bathroom/shower door.  She looked inside as he turned on the light.  He turned on the water and shower head.

""I only have soap, no shampoo or anything fancy, and the hot water only lasts about 10 minutes, but you'll probably feel better.  I'll find you some fresh clothes to wear too.""

She looked at him, ""Clothes?""

""Yes, the ones you have one are in bad shape.  I'll leave some clean ones on the table and you can change after you shower.""  he explained.

The look on her face changed, and not in a way he liked.

""Clothes off?"" she said, the look of fear from last night coming back.  He had a sudden unpleasant realization.  I'm an idiot he thought.

""I'll show you how to lock the door, then I'll go wait in the cab of the truck.  Knock on the rear window when your done.""  he said.  Then he dug out some of his clothes that through wishful thinking and good intentions, would fit her.  An old sweatshirt that was tight on him now, and a pair of work pants, some wool socks.  He showed her how to lock the door, grabbed his coffee and sat in the front of the truck.  He tried finding weather information on the radio, and studied the highway atlas he had.  Old fashioned, but he didn't need the attachments that came with having a smart phone, though he was regretting that decision a bit now.  He really wanted to get this young woman to a place where he could leave her safely.  Eventually there was a soft knock on the window dividing the cab from the camper.

When he got back into the camper, he saw she was dressed in the old clothes he'd left out. The arms and legs rolled up to account for the extra length, her gravid belly helped filling things out.  Still she was almost lost in the oversized sweatshirt and pants but she looked a lot better, the food and hot water adding a little color to her pale cheeks, and her eyes had lost some of the dark circles.   As she moved, he saw that she was holding the pants up one handed.

""I can help with that,"" he said pointing to her waist.  He rummaged through a drawer or two and came out with a length of rope, it wasn't fancy but it would do.  As he approached her with it however, she backed away, into the corner of the camper, her eyes widening in fear.

""Whoa, whoa miss! This is for your pants.""  He pointed at the rope, and then at her pants. He showed her his belt.  She wouldn't let him approach her with it, so in the end, he just set it on the table and backed away.  She laced it through the loops in the pants and tied it in the front, adjusting it's position for comfort over her swollen abdomen.  While she worked he found himself wondering just what kind of hell she'd run off from.

He noticed that she'd thrown the old clothes into the trash, along with the remains of breakfast and the other debris.  He nodded, understanding that what ever she had associated with those clothes, she wanted behind her.

""Well,"" he said, ""We can get moving again if your ready.  I Figure we can make it to the next town through the pass well before midnight, barring any trouble.  Are you ready to travel?""   She looked at him, a grim look of determination set on her fine, pale features.

""Yes,"" she said, ""Away, from here.""   He nodded,

""OK, lets get going then""  he led her out of the camper, and the climbed into the cab.  The rugged old trucks engine coughed to life, and they ground off into the snow.

They'd been driving about twenty minutes or so, slow but steady going, making more distance than he'd expected.  He glanced over at her a few times as they drove, making a better assessment of her in the daylight.  She was very pale, but not albino, her hair, now cleaner and dry was a light color, not blonde exactly, some silver and gold mixed perhaps.  Her eyes were dark, and now in daylight, were a bit larger than average.  Not beyond the normal, but noticeable. Especially to someone with his background, where noticing details was a vital thing for survival.  He also noted marks on her wrists, and one ankle, the kind that would be made when someone was tied or shackled for a long time.  This and the pale skin, came together and the theory that she'd been locked up somewhere for some time came to his mind, combined with her pregnancy and her obvious fear of him and he didn't like it, he did not like it at all.  It made him angry, and he didn't want her to pickup on that.  He had to stay calm, safe, let her settle down, enough so maybe she could tell him what happened.  He decided to try some small talk. 

""You know, in all the excitement, I never got your name,"" he said. ""My names Nick, at least thats what my friends call me, what's yours?""

""Name?"" she said.

""Yes, What should I call you?"" he asked.  He was wondering if she was trying to figure out an alias.  In her condition, protecting herself in anyway made sense.

""My mother called me.\_\_\_\_\_"" she said.  Her name sounded like a string of random consonants and vowels, almost musical.  He struggled a few times trying to pronounce it.  She alternately grimaced or smirked with each attempt.

""I can't really manage that,"" he said, ""could we do a shorter version? How about Lacey for short?""

""Lacey?"" she said. She seemed thoughtful.

""Yeah, just for now, until I can get the hang of your real name."" he said.

""Lacy"" she said again, nodding.

""Very Nice to meet you Lacy,"" He said, offering her his hand.

""Nice to meet you""  she replied, the barest hint of a smile on her face.  She held out her hand too.  He took it gently and gave it a shake.  He was glad she was finally opening up a little.  He was also curious, her hand had felt... different.

They'd been on the road another hour or so, when she suddenly sat up straight.

""Stop"" she said, a hint of urgency in her voice.

""What?"" he'd been focusing on a tricky bit of roadway.

""STOP"" she said again, he saw her face tinged with green, and knew what that meant,  He braked to a stop a bit quicker than he meant to, but just in time.  She opened the door and was just able to lean out before she vomited.  The contents of her stomach splashing quietly in the snow by the road.   She heaved a few more times, then leaned back into the truck, wiping her mouth.  She shut the door, and sat back breathing heavily after her exertion.

""Sorry"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

""Don't worry about it"" he said, ""I've been through a few pregnancies, it happens.""  He handed her a water bottle and a few napkins he had dug out while she was busy. She took them with a look of gratitude that made his heart break. As if kindness was rare for her.

""You OK now?"" He asked, as she finished cleaning up.

""Yes, OK now"" she said.

""Ok, we'll stop in a bit and I'll try to get something easier on the stomach for you.  So you can keep it down.""

She nodded. ""Food was OK, tasted good, not right though"".

""Yeah, that can be tough when you're pregnant.  Sensitive stomach, strong smells."" he'd learned about this with his children.  It seemed unfair to him that his wife had to go through all that while his experience of pregnancy was one of wonder and amazement.

They'd been driving another two hours or so, when he spotted a vehicle off the road.  It looked like it had slid off and rolled down the embankment, the ragged trail of parts sticking up at odd angles in the snow, all barely visible in the blowing swirling snow.

""Uh Oh"" he said, ""looks like someones in trouble.  I'm going to stop and check it out.  You stay here.  In fact, why don't you climb up into the camper and get some food, if you're feeling better.""

She looked at him, ""OK"".

He climbed out of the truck, and worked his way down the embankment, it was slippery, but the deep parts of the snow gave him enough purchase.

The wreck had ended upright, after rolling down the embankment.  The roof was pushed down about a foot, and all the glass was gone, or hanging in jagged patches.  The front end was almost gone, which must have been what left the trail of debris he'd first spotted.  When he got to the drivers side, he found the driver, a man about forty or so, leaning heavily to one side.  Snow had blown in around him, it had been stained red in a great patch on the seat next to the driver.  He reached in and felt for a pulse, the mans neck was like ice, but there, there was a very weak fluttery pulse.  The driver was still alive.  Probably not for long, but if he could get him up to the camper, get him warmed up and stop the bleeding, maybe he could get him to the next town.   As he looked around further, all hopes of saving the driver faded.  The truck must have been carrying building supplies or something.  A piece of pipe, about two inches in diameter had punched through the back wall of the cab, the seat, and the driver, about a foot of it protruded from the drivers lower abdomen, tangling with the steering wheel.   If he pulled the pipe out, the driver would rapidly lose what ever blood he had remaining.  If he left him here he'd freeze to death, if he didn't finish bleeding out first. He pondered, then decided.  He'd grab the blankets and first aid kit from his truck, and pull the pipe out. If he could stuff the wound with gauze he mabe could slow or stop the bleeding, giving the driver an infinitesimal chance that he could get to the next town before he bleed to death.  It was unlikely, but leaving him here to die alone wasn't an option.  He made his way back up to the truck.  He got to the cab, and she was not there.  Good he thought, she's getting some food.  He didn't want her to see what was happening down the embankment.   He grabbed the blanket, and his first aid kit, for what it was worth, and headed back to the wreck.

When he got to there, he checked the driver again.  He'd wasted his efforts, the man had died alone in the snow in the few minutes he'd taken to get to his truck and back. 

""Damn"" he swore softly.  He knew there had been little chance, but still, it was a sad way to go.  As he was placing the blanket over the drivers rapidly cooling corpse, he notice a strange mark on his neck, about halfway between the jaw and the collar.  A flower shaped bruise?  What could have caused that?  Something flying about in the truck during the rollover probably. He finished wrapping the driver in his makeshift shroud, and paused for a minute, in silence.

""Sorry Buddy"" he said, and started back to his truck. 

As he walked up the embankment he noticed something else, curious and concerned he made his way back to his truck.   He was relieved when he opened the cab and found her sitting in the passenger side seat.  She looked to be asleep, or nearly so.  She looked better than she had since they'd met.  Good he thought.  He started the truck and pulled off.  She stirred a bit.

""Going now?"" she said.

""Yes, no reason to stick around."" he replied.

""Good"" she said, and drifted off to sleep.

He looked at her, and wondered about what he'd seen on the way back up from the wreck.  A second, much smaller set of footprints in the snow,

I didn‚Äôt expect the scents to be this light and happy. In fact, I didn‚Äôt even know that white rose as a note exists. But here I am; thinking that this is a peculiar rose; a rose that acts like  a sunflower. This is Rose that you can take out to a cookout, coffee and museum dates, not the Rose in a formal gala wearing all pink while feeling nervous before receiving an award. I wish all those ouds could get this kinda rose to be mixed with. And as a man I can easily pull this off. And this could be a dumb reach easily, too.

**Arabian Orient**
Like the other one, I haven‚Äôt looked up all the notes. But the opening is pretty strong with saffron. I personally dislike it, if it‚Äôs too strong it could give me a headache. But the thing with saffron, it kinda comes and goes; either it‚Äôs a Persian djinn (as Iran is the biggest producer of Saffron) or it‚Äôs a quantum particle. I think this is what happens with most popular bottles with saffron in it (BR540, anyone?). 

But as soon as it disappears, all the other notes remind me of most flea markets in the Middle East; not a mesh of spices that would choke you, but a unique scent experience that you don‚Äôt typically find at home. It‚Äôs not middle-eastern-y, I can smell cardamom and vetiver in the background. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think this will fall into my ‚Äúlove‚Äù category. I can see myself wearing this type of fragrance once in a while. Getting a full bottle? Probably not.

Once again I‚Äôve been put in charge of international nurses day. No budget Ofcourse. Last year my DON paid for everything out of his own personal money but this year he has retired and I‚Äôm not sure who will be DON. I have a feeling they will want everything for nothing (what‚Äôs new lol)

This is what I did last year (edited so it may help) 

Last year all nurses got a key ring saying thankyou (they did like that).
All night shift nurses got some fancy Byron bay biscuits and those instant coffee sachets (nice ones)
We had award ceremony with restaurant vouchers, Lush, T2 and Kikki K gifts 
We did Pictionary with the two nursing directors and our DON made them do slightly phallic objects like a urinal. The nurses thought it was hilarious.
There was also cake
We had a Florence nightengale lamp (picture). Supposed to order real thing in from England this year.
The lunch room was filled with balloons and the lead up was poles wrapped in crepe paper etc

This year our lunch room is gone because of renovations where we did the ceremony
We no longer do cake
My DON personally paid for everything himself- he‚Äôs retired

Also nursing doesn‚Äôt get along with allied health so them helping definitely won‚Äôt happen.

This year‚Äôs theme is: Our Nurses. Our Future. Caring for nurses strengthens economies

1i4ht9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BronwynWhiteRaven/comments/1i4ht9m/productionism_is_the_real_future/,Productionism is the Real Future,"Give a man a fish, he eats for a day. Teach a man to fish, he feeds himself for life. I was taught this when I was very young and despite such knowledge being a part of our culture I was raised to treat the things I could do for myself as hobbies not staples, while being turned into a consumer. Many years later and I now do a lot of things for myself, though I still don't fish since our rivers are polluted here. I've come to term it productionism, the cure to consumerism, resting on the concept that the greatest poverty is a poverty of skill and knowledge.

As we're threatened by our southern neighbours and tariffs soon begin to make life harder for us, it's productionism that will see us through and help us return to and uplift ourselves. Who we are can once again be reflected in the goods we produce and trade, and in some cases it can liberate us from the clutches of polluted and toxic industries that have only weakened, fattened, and made us and the very earth we're a part of, sick. We've paid for the Americanization of our culture in more than just money.

Much like most of us leave school and still hold false beliefs about how our own government works, we also come out without skills that can sustain us in any way other than to make us good labourers and consumers. Unless someone is lucky enough to have parents that were skilled themselves and were able to transfer those skills to them, we're all in the sinking consumer boat together. It wasn't until I was in my  late 30's that I really started to learn the most important things I now know. Like how to really cook, make my own bread, soap, shampoo, creams, how to knit things to keep my family warm. How to go to nature for the answers to my ills, not to shoppers drug mart. Seems small when I list it here, but the life it's given me is one I wouldn't trade for anything. It's a life I wish I had been able to realize a lot sooner.

What can we do for ourselves and how does it benefit us?

First to survive what's coming we must surrender our vices. The junk food. The booze. Smoking. Drugs. The corrupt vanities. These are things that in the best and especially the most difficult of times will rip your soul out and corrupt not only you, but your nation with you. Leading us into even darker times. There may be a day when our profoundly coffee addicted nation can't get coffee. Until the day comes you won't know how true of an addiction it is. Our health is most important now. Quitting while you have a choice is a privilege. Sometimes waiting until you're forced to, is too late to stop the trouble it brings.

Productionism is one way to ensure that we can support our health and our lives. By making things for our selves we can ensure the best ingredients in our foods, baked good, cosmetics, & soaps. removing industry from the equation with all its effluent pipes and effluvia. All the most fundamental of things that we need to sustain a measure of decency without the ""luxury"" of buying it at a store. We can make our own clothes, build our own houses. I come from people who once made the very spoons that fed the settlers on the east coast more than a hundred years ago. The very chains that the ships used to come to shore. What happened to us? We've forgotten ourselves.

Getting started on making things for yourself can seem messy. But necessity isn't only the mother of all invention, it's also the mother of all change. I know many people started making their own bread during covid, I started before that by a bit because of food sensitivities to the additives in bread, and organic bread was hitting $8 a loaf, way out of my comfort zone. I once did the math, using organic flour and making your own bread is the same cost as buying a store bought conventional cheap loaf of bread every day. You can move from bread made in factories, full of chemicals, fillers and GMO's, to 100% organic, just by making it yourself and maybe even save a little bit of money. Once upon a time my mother made it seem like bread came from machines and was too hard to make. Like buying all this store bought food was some kind of achievement. Like sitting in front of a tv was preferable to the living and loving act of making bread. (Forgive her for she was also a product of consumerisms influence) When I learned otherwise my life changed, and became better, happier, and healthier... now my partner regularly gets to enjoy the smell of fresh buns in the morning and goes to work with a fresh home made bun to use for his breakfast sandwich instead of factory produced bread. The lady at the breakfast place he goes to just asked if he would bring her one because it smells so good in the toaster. Even she doesn't want the bread they sell. I wrote down the recipe for her instead.

I developed a chemical sensitivity many years ago, it removed a lot of choice from my life. It became the mother of the necessity of change for pretty much everything. For a long time I sat in a kind of lack, not having what I needed, trying to compensate. Even shaving my hair off. Today I make my own shampoo, conditioner, creams, soaps, use soap nuts for dish soap, and hand wash and hang dry our laundry. I've purged every vice, some begrudgingly, but by necessity, and I know that God's prepared me through this for what's to come. For every choice we make to produce for ourselves what we can we reduce the suffering in the world, and the suffering that lays ahead for those stuck in the consumer machine. When we do for ourselves what we can, increasing our skills and knowledge, we increase the value and quality of our lives right now and in the future. In this generation and the next.

This government pays lip service to issues like the environment, using them as pretexts to rob us of our sovereignty and liberties, to impose progressively socialist agendas. While they tell us we need carbon tax on our homes they're shipping in food from foreign countries at gross environmental costs that we can entirely grow here in Canada. Why should my oregano come from Poland? And why is Oregano grown here more expensive than what's shipped across the ocean? Why should our venison come from Norway? Or Salmon from Scotland? It's needless trade to make others rich and us feds but for a day.

These globalist and consumerist policies are only increasing each generations distance from self sufficiency and making each generation more dependent on the state. Communism isn't a solution to this, it will still be ""pink soap for everyone"" toxic stinking cancer causing goop. True liberty and a true future for all generations comes from breaking the yoke of mental slavery to consumerism. making things for ourselves is not a hobby, it's a necessity, and the time is coming which will make that all to obvious. The thing is that when you make things for yourself, you tend to have more than you need, sometimes just enough to give some away, or even bring it to market. Imagine a nation of people producing things again. Sharing with neighbours, bringing them to market, for real free trade among fellow Canadians. A nation by and for us. Not only saving our health, money, and the environment, but enriching our lives in multiple dimensions.

The solution is in our hands.

1i4hq16,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4hq16,Ditched the gaming laptops and started using one RV AC Powerbank,"As I said I ditched the gaming laptops and those inverters that drain the truck batteries pretty fast.
Decided to show this because my truck decided to shit the bed and I had to get a replacement mid trip.

Setup here is a Legion GO + USB-C Chinese LCD
The picture is the consumption during the photo with YouTube playing and the screen connected.

The best part is that I can control the power on the fly that the legion go uses down to 5w just for movie watching.

To power everything is a Bluetti AC180 that can also power the microwave 1400w, and the  coffee machine 1200w.

A little pros and cons between the battery and the inverter.

Pros:
No installation required like the inverter.

 I can switch tractors fast and take my AC power with me.

It fully charges during driving in about 6h connected to the 24v socket, so less idle time on the engine when parked to use my shit.

On a full charge during a rest day using the microwave twice 10m each time, several uses of the coffee machine and the legion go + screen for 9h still 17% left.

With a cable you can slow charge one truck  battery (you can't charge both in 24v only 12v).

More truck battery left for heating or AC parking.


Cons:

It's bulkier, hence occupies more precious cab space.

More electrical stuff that can eventually break down.

Today he invited me to get coffee with him over his 15 minute break. There's a cafe in the lobby of the building he works at. 
I agreed and met him.
We don't kiss. It's fine. I didn't initiate and he was showing me the koi pond. 
However, when we start walking towards the cafe, I put my hand on his arm, like usual, and he fully and immediately shook me off him in a way that was incredibly triggering for me. Like I was disgusting to him. Like he didn't want anyone to know he was practically married to me. Like we hadn't been sharing a bed.
We walked to the cafe. Me, exactly two steps behind him. Him, not looking back at me. 
It's not a big place, but there are a few tables, it's not packed. Maybe 1/3 full. Almost busy, but not quite. 
He gets the coffee hands both to me and tells me to wait for him outside. I comply and sit at the only little table out front.
He picks up two slices of pie from inside, then walks out and immediately past me, doesn't stop, or look back. Turns a corner and gets on an elevator. 
I'm not able to follow him in time, so once I also make it blindly around the corner, he's nowhere to be seen until only his arm sticks out of one of the elevator doors. 
I get on board. 
There is another person onboard. 
Neither one specifically acknowledges me (though I don't expect the stranger to do so). 
After the stranger departs, my boyfriend becomes somewhat more animated, but in my head, I am still trying to catch up on the situation. 
He takes me to the roof of the building. The view is amazing, but I'm still processing the journey to it. 
He leads me to his preferred spot, then says ""Hey, let's drop this weird energy."" 
I say ""I'd like to, but my feelings are hurt."" 
He says he didn't do anything wrong, and just didn't want to show his affection in front of the office. The only affection I was asking for in the moment was to just touch his arm, but his reaction to it was more like I was trying to get him to spit in my mouth right then and there. 
I said I'd like to end the discussion and talk about it over lunch, so I could calm down and proceed things, because I acknowledge that I'm prickly about public affection because of how I've been treated. 
He is almost angry at that, and says he's done nothing to deserve being treated this way and that I should be able to let go of it. 
I said that I can't, and repeated that I wanted to talk about it later. 
He kept going. Kept saying that I was being obstinate. That I was being childish and unreasonable and difficult. He kept saying that he was blameless and that I was being mean to him. 
I apologized and said that I'd like to leave. 
He walked me to the stairwell, but immediately blocked the path and started again telling me how mean and unfair I was being. I apologized and told him that I was uncomfortable having this conversation in a stairwell and that I would like to continue the discussion over lunch. 
He turned and lead me back to the elevator though a silent hallway. 
He tried to take my hand, but I pulled mine back, and told him I was uncomfortable showing him affection here in the hallway. 
He asked if I would be okay on the elevator. I said no. 
He said I was being obstinate and stubborn and toxic. 
I apologized and said I didn't want to have this conversation. 
We boarded the elevator. 
People were already on it. 
Probably hearing parts of our conversation. 
We rode down in silence before departing to the attached parking deck. 
He walked me out through the back stairwell onto the street, pausing again to tell me how cruel I was being. 
How he only wanted to get coffee and go to the roof. He apologized for not letting me hold his arm but said I was being unreasonable for reacting. 
I apologized and said that I would like to continue the conversation over lunch, stepped onto the street, and assumed he would go back to work. 
He followed me down the sidewalk and stopped me by grabbing my hand harder than I could pull away from without being visibly angry myself.
He kept saying how mean I was being. How inconsiderate. 
I apologized and really told him that he needed to stop and that I would talk about it over lunch, at home, then walked away while putting my earbuds in and starting my audiobook. 
He followed me. Grabbed my hand hard. And lead me home as I tried to actually pull away from him there in public on the sidewalk, almost to the point where I would have looked distinctly angry at him. 
At least one passerby had heard our last exchange and said something to him that I didn't catch, but also didn't deter him from continuing to follow me or lead me on somewhat forcibly. 
He brought me all the way home like that. 
Him occasionally scolding me, and me saying nothing. 
At home, he got angry and told me that I was putting him in a box. I was being cruel. He was only trying to tell me how he felt and to talk about his emotions and I was shutting down and trying to prevent him from expressing himself. I was mean. I was rude. I was going to be alone because I treat people who love me so poorly. 
Then he asked me to kiss him and I said no. 
Then he took the house keys and left.

After years inside a windowless office, it's amazing to have natural light and see outside. If the weather were warmer, I could get fresh air, as well.  
It's so peaceful. If I want, I can listen to music or podcasts *without headphones.* My old office was noisy and cliquish; now I don't have to deal with the drama and chatter.  *I can use my own bathroom.* I don't have to deal with the nasty break room. No brown bagging it. I wear what I want, no dress code.  
I can sleep later and feel so much more relaxed starting my workday, since I don't have to rush around gathering everything up to leave.  
And the big one, no driving to work in bad weather! I can sip coffee while looking out at a snowfall, where I used to stress about the state of the roads.  

What I miss: Some friends, and friendly faces. I do think it's possible this will come to weigh more as time goes by. But I can stay in touch with my friends if so desired. So far, the benefits of a comfortable working environment outweigh the downsides. I'm hoping it stays that way.",4,1737234695.0,workfromhome,3,0.83,False

What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a powdered supplement designed to be mixed into your coffee. Unlike traditional weight loss pills or shakes, Java Burn is unique because it dissolves seamlessly in your morning coffee without adding any taste. According to the manufacturers, Java Burn is formulated to enhance the fat-burning process by boosting your metabolism and improving your body‚Äôs ability to burn calories more efficiently. The supplement contains natural ingredients known to help in weight loss, all without any harmful stimulants or additives.

¬†

Ingredients of Java Burn

One of the key factors that people consider before using any supplement is its ingredients. What are the ingredients in Java Burn that make it effective? The product is made up of several natural compounds that are known to aid weight loss:

¬†

Green Tea Extract: Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract can boost metabolism and increase fat burning.

Chlorogenic Acid: This compound, found in coffee, reduces the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system, helping to prevent fat buildup.

¬†

L-Theanine: An amino acid that works to improve focus and reduce anxiety, making it an excellent complement to the caffeine in coffee.

Chromium: This mineral regulates blood sugar levels, helping to curb appetite and reduce cravings.

¬†

These ingredients work synergistically to deliver the promised benefits of increased fat burning and improved metabolism. Users have reported significant results, praising the supplement for helping them lose weight without the jitters or crashes often associated with caffeine-heavy products.

¬†

¬†Where to Buy Java Burn

For those wondering where to buy Java Burn, the official website is the safest bet. While Java Burn on Amazon is a popular option, buying directly from the manufacturer ensures that you‚Äôre getting the authentic product. Additionally, purchasing from the official site often comes with special offers and discounts that aren‚Äôt available on third-party platforms.

¬†

Java Burn is also available at select retailers like Walmart, but availability may vary. Whether you buy it online or in-store, make sure to check that you‚Äôre purchasing from a reputable source to avoid counterfeit products.

1i4heyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1i4heyp/need_tipsrecs_on_some_light_roast/,Need tips/recs on some light roast.,"I'm a V60/espresso guy but recently bought the aeropress for travel. Having a bit of a hard time dialing in light roast bean I have: Guji Ethiopian, light roast, natural process.

What's your typical settings/recipe?

I think I am getting closer but nowhere as good as v60 pour. I wonder if this is an aeropress thing or grind adjustment. Heres's my data so far

Grinder: 1zpresso Q.

attempt 0: 45 clicks, temp 204F, Aeropress recipe

\- Taste like tea lol

attempt 1: 42 clicks, temp 204F, James Hoffman recipe 1:18

\- Not good, watery, no body no acidity.

attempt 2: 38 clicks, temp 204F, James Hoffman recipe 1:18

\- Better, still watery, little body, no acidity

attempt 3: 30 clicks, temp 204F, James Hoffman recipe 1:18 (this is here I'm at)

\- First thing I noticed is that I am espresso territory grind size lol but good new is that I finally have body, fruity notes are starting to come in so I know I'm getting close but damn I did't realize I have to go so so fine.

I am taking a break from coffee lol too much caffeine before noon already today. So I am asking for my next cup, maybe one after dinner lol.

Here's my idea for the next one:

\- 35 clicks, temp 204F, James Hoffman recipe 1:18. I tried to avoid chasing too many variable to keep the dial more consistent but I think I might explore adjusting the bloom time 2mins down to 1min or 30s at a finer setting.

EDIT: just to be clear I did use the same bean/grinder for v60 and definitely got a way better cup! I'm trying to replicate it on the aeropress or as close as possible.",1,1737234409.0,AeroPress,4,1.0,False

For months, I've been staring at my finances, that tangled mess of transactions and forgotten subscriptions, and thought, ""There HAS to be a better way."" Every month, I'm manually sifting through PDF statements, trying to remember if I¬†still¬†need that streaming service I signed up for on a whim at 3 AM. The frustration was real.

Then, a stupid idea popped into my head. A glorious, insane idea.¬†**What if I just‚Ä¶ built the damn thing myself?**

And then the even¬†stupider¬†part hit:¬†**What if I tried to do it in a weekend?**

Yeah, I know. Hear me out.

Fueled by an unholy amount of coffee and the burning desire to escape financial spreadsheet hell, I decided to embark on a 72-hour coding odyssey. The goal? To create a functional MVP of an app that could finally tame my financial chaos. I christened it¬†**SlothFi**¬†‚Äì because even managing your money should feel a little bit‚Ä¶ well, less frantic.

**The Breakdown of My Descent into Madness:**

* **Day 1: The Dawn of Delusion:**¬†I spent most of the first day wrestling with the core concept. How do I make this¬†actually¬†useful? I knew I wanted PDF statement processing, a way to track subscriptions (the bane of my existence!), and some kind of intelligent categorization. Cue frantic scribbling on whiteboards and more coffee.
* **Day 2: The Coding Crucible:**¬†This was where the rubber met the road, or rather, where my fingers furiously pounded the keyboard. I dove headfirst into integrating libraries, battling with APIs (shoutout to Gemini and Ollama for the AI muscle!), and trying to make a UI that wasn't completely hideous. Sleep? What's sleep? I think I saw it mentioned in a documentation file somewhere.
* **Day 3: The (Almost) Finish Line:**¬†The exhaustion was setting in, but the end was in sight. Polishing the rough edges, squashing bugs that looked at me funny, and desperately trying to make sure the ""Get Started"" button actually did something. There were moments I thought I‚Äôd collapse onto my keyboard, but the thought of finally having¬†my own¬†financial management tool kept me going.

**So, what did I manage to cobble together in this self-imposed pressure cooker?**

**SlothFi**¬†(even in its raw, just-born state) boasts these features:

* **One-Click Expense Tracking:**¬†Upload your PDF bank statements, and using the power of Gemini and Ollama, SlothFi attempts to categorize your transactions. It's not perfect, but it's a damn good start.
* **Subscription Management:**¬†It tries to identify recurring payments and lets you keep track of your active subscriptions. No more accidental renewals!
* **Bill Management (Basic):**¬†A simple calendar view to see upcoming bills (still very much a work in progress!).

**You can see the beast (in its current form) here:** [**https://slothfi.in**](https://slothfi.in)

**(Yes, it's a bit rough around the edges. Yes, there might be bugs. I literally built this in 72 hours. Be gentle!)**

**Why am I sharing this with you, the glorious denizens of** r/SideProject\*\*?\*\*

Because I need your brutally honest feedback. I'm sure I've missed obvious things. I probably made some terrible UX choices in my sleep-deprived state. Tell me what you think!

* **Does this solve a problem you have?**
* **What features are missing?**
* **What's completely broken?**
* **Any UI/UX suggestions?**

I'm not trying to launch the next unicorn overnight (though, wouldn't that be nice?). I just want to build something genuinely useful, and I know the collective wisdom of this community is the best way to get there.

So, go ahead, tear it apart (constructively, please!). Try it out. Let me know what you think. And maybe, just maybe, this insane weekend project will actually turn into something awesome.

**TL;DR: I tried to build a financial SaaS in 72 hours. My brain hurts, but I made something! Check out SlothFi and tell me what you think.**

Thanks in advance for your feedback! Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go find that mythical ""sleep"" thing I heard about.

1i4hew3,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1i4hew3/in_flux_what_is_the_best_weight_to_use_a/,"In Flux, what is the best weight to use a character Lora to generate images of the character that depart substantially from certain characteristics of the character?","I have a character Lora that I created for a particular person. I am trying to create some images using certain characteristics belonging to the person while ignoring others. For instance, the character is a human being, but in some instances I want to make an image of the character as a non-human. I was trying to create an image of the character with the character‚Äôs face and upper body, but with the lower half of a squid (i.e., tentacles). When I was trying to do this, Flux consistently generated images with human legs (and with tentacles sort of as ‚Äúaccessories‚Äù) and no matter how I phrased the prompt, it would not replace legs with tentacles. In this case, there happens to be another Lora on Civitai which has half-human/half-squid, and ultimately I was able to do so using both Loras.

That being said, I am wondering if there are things I should be doing in order to utilize the characteristics I‚Äôm talking about (most commonly, the facial features) while allowing Flux to create creative imagery. I‚Äôm aware of the ‚Äúblock weight‚Äù settings that are supposed to use the face characteristics only, but even when I did that it was consistently coming back with legs. Similarly, I tried doing a prompt where the person‚Äôs face was appearing in the steam arising from a cup of coffee, and the images generally were just pictures of the human being‚Äôs head coming out of a cup of coffee (i.e., a fully materialized human head, as opposed to steam with the facial characteristics).

Should I be adjusting the ‚Äústrength‚Äù settings in the Lora node? I am using the rgthree Power Lora Loader, if that makes any difference, since I often combine Loras. The Lora weight I typically use is set at 1.00, but that‚Äôs mostly because I‚Äôm very new to this and don‚Äôt necessarily know a lot about what adjustments to make.

Should I also be using particular samplers or schedulers to try and do what I‚Äôm trying to do? I usually just leave it set at dpmpp_2m and switch between beta, simple, and sgm_uniform, but again that‚Äôs because of my limited experience.

First I found a point of reference, in the beginning of 1.2 >!the sons of Calydon find Perlman's crashed airship and debate what to do with him. !<From Piper's comment, the amount of money on the bounty could buy 5 steeltusks.

Now for the math, assuming that the steeltusk is similar to that of your run-of-the-mill semi-truck. Your brand new semi-truck will run on average $250,000, multiply that by five and you get $1,250,000.

Ok here comes the tricky part, from posts on interknot>!Perlman's!<bounty is worth 5,000,000 dennies. and to get the exchange rate from DNY to USD we need to divide 5,000,000 by 1,250,000, and then flip it for the other way around, so throwing that into a calculator we get a rate of:

4 DNY to 1 USD

1 DNY = .25 USD

now here are some price conversions both in game and real life.

Coff cafe coffees:

Most coffee is 2,500 DNY -> 625 USD or 37,500 monochromes  
With the New Eridu Special is 1,500 DNY -> 375 USD or 22,500 monochromes

at Waterfall Cafe:  
Vegetable Noodles is 1,800 DNY -> 450 USD or 27,000 monochromes.  
With the more high-end options being 5,000 DNY ->  1,250 USD. or 75,000 monochromes  


Median price to live in las vegas:

I'm 26M, and due to financial circumstances, currently live with my Mother, who is currently determined to get the essence of banana on just about every food item I've bought, as well as every kitchen surface, utensil, the kettle, etc. in the full knowledge that they make me utterly nauseated.

Whenever I ask her to simply wash her hands, or keep the fruit bowl in a permanent space, rather than constantly shuffling it, she will in turn accuse me of ""dictating"" her eating habits, to the point of ""coercive control"".

I'll explain that it's utterly absurd that I should care about or determine her eating routine, so long as it doesn't take my food along for the ride.

Her response? ""EXACTLY. YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT MY FEELINGS""

Seemingly, it's a betrayal that I can't be at one with her newly fruitarian habits, as though the sensation is ""shared"".

As a result, I've had a very expensive week, getting coffee and eating out where possible.

I'm stunned that over something as fundamental as food, they're willing to cause maximal chaos.",4,1737234242.0,raisedbyborderlines,3,1.0,False

1i4hbeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i4hbeh/aita_for_asking_my_man_what_would_be_easier_for/,"AITA For asking my man ""what would be easier for you to make"" when he said if he has to ""make sandwiches everytime you don't cook I'll get pissed off""","Hello Reddit, I've never posted on here but I do enjoy hearing the stories (that I'll no longer be able to enjoy) on tik tok, and this has been burning on my mind for awhile so I thought, fuck it, let's ask the audience. 

I (29 F) work a full time job as a sales rep at a cell phone company, and still come home and cook, clean (when I'm able), do the laundry, and all while being 36 weeks pregnant. My man (32 M) is a UAV pilot who works full time as well, though he hasn't been deploying as much, so a lot of the time he comes home from lunch and eats the leftovers from dinner. 

For awhile, I had been meal prepping his lunches because it makes it easier on me, since I can space out having to cook every night to every other night or so by retaining leftovers that he doesn't eat for lunch, and I can get off of my feet for a while and just relax. Granted, my pregnancy has been fairly easy on me (i.e. no morning sickness, not too many mood swings, etc.) But the EXHAUSTION is something that i can't quite shake. Plus with my daughter getting as big as she is now, I have unbelievable pain in my nether regions from where her head is currently sitting. 

For some context, when we first got together, he didn't mind making dinner's for us or heating up some pre cooked chicken nuggets for us for lunches, and never really held me to such high expectations of cooking (aside from making his and his dad's breakfast every morning i stayed the night) so I guess I never really knew what I was getting myself into until we moved in together.

But as soon as we did, that all changed. Suddenly, he's told me that he's been ""honest"" about what he expected out of a partner this whole time, stating that he wants a woman who is happy to make her man happy by being ""nurturing"", and making sure he's fed. And by fed, he expects breakfast, lunch, and dinner to be provided daily, and it goes so far as to him not even being able to be bothered to re-heat leftovers from the night before, and expects me to bring it to him while he games on his PC. 

When i bring up how exhausted I am, he usually ""jokes"" and says ""are you sure you're not OVARY-acting"" (so fucking funny üôÑ), and he's once told me that I've used pregnancy as an excuse for things it shouldnt actually excuse. Mind you, I get off of work typically around 6:30pm at the earliest, 7:30pm at the latest, and that i not only cook all of the food, but still have to do all of the grocery shopping myself (though I admit I just do curbside because shopping inside will take too long, and again, I JUST WANT TO RELAX). So I pick up the groceries, bring them up to the apartment, put them all away, and set to work on dinner and sometimes even meal prepping his foods straight after I finish with dinner (eating in between). This means that sometimes I'm cooking for 2-3 hours at a time, and this only preps about 1 week's worth of lunches and breakfasts, and I have to do it all over again the next week. If he doesn't have the breakfast burritos, he prefers i wake up before him to have his egg whites with turkey done and a slice of toast with coffee (which i admit, i haven't been doing lately because i can barely sleep with having to pee all throughout the night and struggling to get comfortable, and snooze as close as I can to when I need to get ready for work). Once, I told him how much pain my back and feet are in after an especially long cooking session, he just told me to ""wear my maternity belt and cushioned shoes to help with the pain"".

He's also asked why i don't ""do the things I used to when we first got together"", like ""dressing up for him"" (i don't wear make up at home and prefer to hang out in my pj's, which are usually just a mix match of joggers or pj pants and whatever graphic tee or tank top i have on hand), so he thinks i look a bit frumpy all of the time. He also says i don't (sorry for TMI) initiate intimacy with him anymore, and that i talk all the time about how pregnancy hormones make me in the mood, but I dont act on it (again, I'M SORRY THAT I HAVE TO WORK TO EVEN GET THAT ACTION, TOO!!). Mind you, 9 times out of 10 he doesn't initiate, either, so I assume he doesn't want to. Plus, I'll admit, by this point, I'm not as attracted to him as I used to be. Maybe it's because subconsciously he's become more like a dependent than a partner, and I'm not into children, thank you very much....

Not only that, but the cleaning is mainly my doing as well, though he does clean up the dishes for me after I cook, which is nice. He changes the litter for me currently as well, only because I can't due to pregnancy. But laundry, actual cleaning and scrubbing, all me. I broke down my first trimester due to exhaustion, sobbing about how difficult it is to maintain this lifestyle, and admittedly when we first moved in, I'd agreed that I'd do it, since he paid all of the rent with me only covering utilities. But I didn't imagine how hard it is to be responsible for two full grown adults, and now having a baby on the way is making me extremely stressed just thinking about maintaining work, a baby, and a full grown baby. I'd offered to split everything money-wise 50/50 if it meant that we could split household chores and cooking 50/50, and he said that he would ""feel like roommates, and attraction would fade"", pretty much meaning he wouldn't want that because it's ""not what he wanted"", and would end things with me. So I basically gathered from the convo ""step in line, or kick rocks"".

Fast forward to two nights ago, and I was, as always, reheating our leftovers for us and making a fresh batch of fried rice as a side (there wasn't enough for him, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and he noticed there wasn't enough for his lunch the next day. I said that he could just eat what was left and I'd figure something out for lunch, but he insisted I eat it for the baby's sake. He then asked what he'd do about lunch, and said that I needed to be more mindful about us running out of leftovers and if we were, that i needed to ""cook again"". I said he could just make a sandwich when he got home, since he works only 4 minutes from our apartment, and he said that ""if i have to keep eating sandwiches for lunch when you don't make anything I'm going to get pissed off"".

So i sort of rubbed my eyes in frustration and said in an annoyed tone ""is there something easier that you can make for yourself?"" To which he responded ""do we really need to have this conversation again? What did we agree on??"" And I had responded again, a bit dejected, ""you pay the rent, and I do the 'womanly' duties of the house."" Then he walked away, muttering something about how he'll ""figure something out for lunch"", but he was clearly pissed. 

He's now refusing to speak to me, and even yesterday after I brought home groceries and was making dinner, I saw him go in the kitchen clearly looking for something to snack on, and told him I'd bought his favorite chips, and he curtly responded with ""thanks"", turned on his heels, and went back to the room, slammed the door shut, and resumed gaming with his friends.

I'm about to bring my first child into this world, and now I'm uncertain on hers and my future.... He's made it clear he won't let me take our daughter from him, and I don't know if that means he'd go for full custody, or what... So part of me wants to make peace, the other is screaming at me to run. So, AITA?

P.s. Sorry for such a long read, but all of this has been eating at me since the beginning of my pregnancy, and I don't have anyone else to talk to about it. Until I figure out my next move, I dont want to tell my family/friends because I feel like I already know what they'll say.",2,1737234134.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Guy here 28 from isb , i used to always full of life in , around 6 years ago it all started with a panic attack one day and after that became a victim of serious anxiety issues and panic attacks. Long story short
I did coupe up with it after some treatments.
It kinda vanished and i got better again

Then after few years it again came back and made me very uncomfortable. I started having social anxiety and i started fearing leaving home alone. But still I always tried my best to go through this illness and kept going! So i used to live a life with getting better for some months and sometimes a year but then again my dad days come back! 

This created a lot of fear and insecurities inside me i also developed facial dismorphia aswell. And used to think i am not good enough. I never was able to figure out what was exactly happening with me. Anyways i kept going‚Ä¶

I loose the hope and one day i met a stranger  online who gave me that light i needed since a long time and that person made me feel safe and gave me that confidence i needed to live and made me feel alive again. I told that person all my inner fears and that person absorbed them all and it brought a huge spark in me that i never imagined in past and i started driving and started going out again 
My life started getting normal! And i was more then happy! 
(That person was engaged and I knew it, i never asked that person for anything except company and we used to laugh and talk a lot and with time i started getting very  stable) 
i started praying regularly and i felt everything was going right and one day it all ended  ( i cant explain here as this would get super long then) 

After comming back to life and slowly slowly 
i started feeling alone again and the nightmare of panic attacks again came back with more intensity till a point i told my self  its the end i cant live like this 
The fear of death started making me think is life is just a lie and its not worth to follow materialistic things and stuff i used to go after

So i told myself i have to change myself and help humanity now. I want to give charity i want to become a beautiful human i want to pray a lot I just want to become the best person i can be. Yet i have the fear of being alone, i am an only child and i just have a huge fear now. 

I realised that when i used to talk to ‚Äòthat person‚Äô i started comming back to life and it was the best time of my life. 

I am ready to live alone whole of my life but i just sometimes think that maybe maybe i can find someone again who can be by my side and support me and i can support her! And we can try our best to make our lives great! 

About my personality: 

I am a very ambi vert person, 
My current issues made me an introvert but i still want to live life again and go to nice coffee shops or go into the mountains and travel! I love the idea of camping and cooking steaks. 

I love to make my close friends happy and i am emotionally empathetic person, at this stage i really wanna come Close to deen that i am trying yet i am still not able to reach that level 

I do want kids and i love children tbh
I wanna take them to park and chill with them haha

I am graduated and i belong to good family who is very supportive and very sweet with me. They have been with my 24/7 with my bad days and i am sure my dad and mum are literally one of the nicest person youll meet. 

What i dont want in a partner: too materialistic, i myself love to buy things and stuff but i just like that thinking where we completely forget our real purpose in this world and start comparing our selves with people and get jealous cuz of materialism 
- i want her to be understanding that i do have a provider mindset and i want to take care of her but i can go out often untill i am not fully recovered. I am more then ok with you using driver and the car
- I want you to support me and give me hope about the future! 
- Be honest with my about your past as i brought the courage to say everything here yet i did not told this to people i know in real

1i4h4nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1i4h4nn/dead_bedroom_lite_some_tips/,Dead Bedroom Lite- Some Tips,"Hi everyone-

I‚Äôm new here and for anyone in a dead bedroom lite situation (I‚Äôm with a partner who is breastfeeding and 11 months post partum with pelvic pain and zero desire for sex), I just thought I‚Äôd share some helpful tips that have helped us go from really really bad communication, sleeping in separate rooms, lots of resentment to sleeping in the same bed, cuddling, kissing, communicating, her taking her clothes off and intertwining legs, her holding my body tight while I jack off.

1.  Take care of yourself.  Shower, hit the gym or find some body weight exercises at home, eat well, get off your phone at night, be at your peak. Do this every day.  

2. Buy yourself something nice.  If it‚Äôs something you would encourage your partner to do- getting new underwear, getting a massage, new socks or those jeans you wanted‚Ä¶ do it.  Do it a couple times a month.  

3.  If your partner is being rude, passive aggressive, and not treating you the way you want to be treated, use the proper way of expressing your needs- I felt angry and frustrated and felt like I didn‚Äôt know how I could help you when you were throwing dishes around in the kitchen. I need better communication- it‚Äôs okay to be angry sometimes.  If they‚Äôre angry all the time but only around you, let them know, but keep it focused on specific events, don‚Äôt dredge the past and make it focused on how it makes you feel and what you need and how you can work together to fix it.  

3. Carry the mindset of- I love this person.  We‚Äôre in this together, and we‚Äôre going to make it work together. I‚Äôm here for you, and it‚Äôs the little daily things that matter more than the big things.  Deeper down, carry the mindset of I can give it my all after the relationship is over or I can give it my all before then.  

4.  Treat your wife like you are on the first week of dating.  When you‚Äôre out and about, you think about her and bring her back a muffin and the local events newspaper.  You buy her a shirt at an interesting coffee shop you went to.  Some being a bitch, and be a fun person again.  Hug and Kiss her every time you or her leave the house and in the morning and at night.  Tell her you love her.  You take the kiss don‚Äôt ask.  This is your job.  

4a. Appreciate your wife.  I really appreciate you taking care of setting up those doctor appointments- it‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt always remember.  I appreciate you getting the kids clothes all ready for swim lessons.  It‚Äôs not easy to keep track of that stuff and you just make it happen.  

5.  Get your ass off the couch and take care of your house.  Don‚Äôt do chorefare, but if you have a stay at home wife, you go above and beyond and do it for you and your family.  You‚Äôre not doing it for her.  Have goals and stick to your timelines.

5a.  Be a better listener.  You‚Äôre not a good listener- stop solving the problems.  Read up on how to listen, and consider why your wife is nagging at you.  Turn your brain off and stop thinking of responses.  

6.  Get your wife sleep, alone time, out of the house.  I give my wife all of Sunday and say get out of the house and go enjoy yourself.  When I‚Äôm home on the weekends and weekday, I take the baby monitor and take care of my kids.  

6a.  If you‚Äôre not making meals, learn.  Cook dinner a couple nights a week and let your wife know which days.  Make sure she knows you love cooking and you‚Äôre excited about trying a new recipe this week.  

7.  Read the room- don‚Äôt hug your wife when she‚Äôs doing dishes.  

7a. Re-establish non sexual context- I told my wife I‚Äôm taking a break from asking her for sex, that I‚Äôm done having bad maintenance sex with her and asking her for sex.  I said the ball is in your court whenever you‚Äôre ready.  I said that sex and intimacy is incredibly important and essential for me and I want it in my relationship.  The important take away here is sticking with what you say- at night when she came back to the bed, I asked her to cuddle with me days later, I asked her if I could scratch her back days after that, and weeks after that, I said I want to cuddle without her pj‚Äôs for a little while (she keeps them on because she‚Äôs on nightly kid duty- this is obviously the partial cause of the issue).  She took off her bottoms and intertwined her legs with me and we flipped around spooning each other.  Did I pop a boner?  Yes.  Did I escalate?  Absolutely not. I massage her ass, scratch her legs, back neck, and ask her if I missed any place- oh yes, scalp etc.  stick to your word on this.  I had some bossa nova playing on the radio while taking care of the kids this afternoon by myself, grabbed her close to dance, and after a few moments, she initiated a passionate makeout session (in front of our kids lol).  We had barely been pecking each other 2 months ago.

8. Convey your physical needs in a healthy way.  What has worked for me- after watching a good movie together‚Ä¶ I say I‚Äôm super horny and I‚Äôm going to masturbate.  I‚Äôd love it if you held me or lay next to me.  She says yes, and starts gently patting my chest as I‚Äôm going at it.  I go at it harder, and reach back, grab her ass and pull her tight to me.  She grabs me tight on my chest and starts massaging me.  I tell her I love her, I don‚Äôt escalate, just hold her ass in my one hand and keep saying dirty ish things- oh I miss that tight little pussy of yours.  Afterwards she says something along the lines of ‚ÄòI know you need more‚Äô.  I tell her what I want- I look forward to tying you down and having my way with you.  Now flip over- I‚Äôm giving you a massage and some back scratches.  Don‚Äôt fucking escalate with your hands.  Enjoy what you have.  Consider asking her to join you as you masturbate instead of directly asking her if she wants to.  ‚ÄòHey I‚Äôm super horny and am going to masturbation, I‚Äôd love it if you wanted to just be next to me while I do.‚Äô  Be okay with the rejection and have a nice loud sensual masturbation session with yourself.  Turn off the porn.  Learn about your body.  My wife once commented that I sounded like I was having a lot of fun.  I was. 

8a.  Don‚Äôt fucking stonewall.  I‚Äôve tried it and it makes everything so much worse.  Read no more Mr nice guy and be open in communication when you‚Äôre frustrated about the little things.  When you‚Äôre really frustrated about your lack of intimacy, you tell your wife exactly what you‚Äôre feeling.  I‚Äôm feeling horny and I want to feel love and passion with my partner and I want my kids to see love and touch in their household and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre getting that.  I want a partner that is working on this with me- getting help from dr, asking for help, being open, figuring out how to create touch and intimacy again (my wife doesn‚Äôt help much at all- this seems very typical here).  I tell my wife that I don‚Äôt hide our intimacy relationship problems from friends and family anymore, and I tell her this won‚Äôt work for me and that our relationship is going down the shitter if I need to.  

 Enjoy the small moments of intimacy, take things slow, set sexual boundaries.  Take a hug and grab your wife, but don‚Äôt overstay your welcome- let go before she does.  Read ‚Äòcome as you are‚Äô.  

8a.  Communicate.  Talk about interesting things with your wife.  Feed her brain.  Watch movies and talk about them afterwards.  Talk about experiences and ask questions.  First date energy.


9.  Enjoy yourself.  My wife hopped naked into the private family shower with me (and the kids running around my feet) at the ymca today and grabbed me tight and made out with me.  I didn‚Äôt ask for it.  

9a.  Flirt with people in front of your wife.  This is a little edgy, but when you‚Äôre at Costco, pick the line with the cute girl and be a sexy dad at the register and chat up the girl at the register when you‚Äôre with your wife or not.

10.  This is a very very weird one, but if you wear glasses, get contact lenses now!!! The wife has not only commented that she likes seeing my face, but there is definitely some face reading and eye contact that was not happening before!!!! Like sexy eye contact.  She looks at me much more now!  

11. This is one I‚Äôm about to start working on.  Get a babysitter NOW.  Plan a date and tell your wife that you both are going out on X day.  Don‚Äôt ask her to help you plan it.  Just fucking get it done and pick a few activities that you think you‚Äôd both like. You‚Äôre going to talk about your kids the at first and that‚Äôs okay.  Then you‚Äôre going to realize you don‚Äôt know anything about each other anymore.  That‚Äôs okay too.  Revel in the pain.  Make shit better.  Date your wife.

I know a lot of you have way way worse situations than me, but for anyone that is going through a post partum dead bedroom with a lot of resentment, I really hope this helps.  Get your wife out of the house or downstairs away from earshot of the kids and back to doing the things she likes, and get her some exercise.  ",7,1737233634.0,DeadBedrooms,0,0.9,False

The only times I've had to resort to discharging a BM in my diaper is when I am knowingly sick with the flu or otherwise somewhere by myself as a last resort. Yet today was a completely different situation in public at a restaurant with my roommates. 

They're all aware of my disposition and management, so when the small diner had no available restrooms to dash to when a sudden urgency hit, and no neighborhood businesses open... It hit like a brick. 

Apparently something upset my stomach, and when met with coffee gave me an instantaneous void in a matter of minutes. They embarrassment was met by looks of disgust from patrons and concern for my roommates. 

Our food had yet to hit the table and there was no way I was going to sit there like that. So I had to go to the car to get my diaper bag and come back in the restroom restaurant to wait for available restroom. Standing in my own filth for the better part of 10 mins. 

The only saving grace was my daily regiment of chlorofresh to reduce urine smells, and in this instance eliminated major smells that would have driven customers out the door. 

 Thankfully the person in front of me was well aware of what had transpired, and let me cut in line. Only to find that the restroom had a tiny little trash can that was not big enough for my biohazard waste bag, so I had to exit the restroom with my soiled diaper in the bright bag then carrying it out to their dumpster out back. 

I've never felt so ashamed and discouraged, not to mention I have completely lost my appetite over the embarrassment once I went back inside and our food had arrived. Only to have it topped off by an affirmative comment from our 50yo waitress as we paid, who mentioned something like her father also has IBS and she's no stranger to these situations. 

I don't think I could ever return and risk facing the staff or potentially seeing any diners who witnessed the entire situation. I think I'm just going to crawl in a hole and die this weekend. I'm so sorry for those of you who have to deal with the situations on the daily.

1. Drop spot for coats, shoes, kids backpacks, etc.   
2. Place for cat/dog food/water bowls  
3. Overflow storage for non-food house items like scissors, pens/pencils, notebooks, etc. Appliance storage would be a bonus. 

I made up some ideas with these renders but they are limited in what they can show. Right now the idea is to have a hall tree behind that door on the left (to garage), for coats and shoes and such, and then a breakfast nook on the right. I'd like that space to be cozy and aesthetic but functional as well. I like the idea of a nook so there is a space to sip coffee and read in the morning. In general we already have plenty of seating (island plus dining table past the kitchen), so I want to consider all the possibilities that might work. 

The renders are pretty rough in that I could only use the tools available, but hopefully you get the picture. The one render is from that front wall where the plants currently are to give reference to what the rest of the kitchen is planned to look like.

1i4gz1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProfitecGo/comments/1i4gz1b/tips_on_the_profitec_go_after_15_years_of_use/,Tips on the Profitec Go after 1.5 years of use. ,"I was inspired by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProfitecGo/comments/1i0uhwr/anyone_else_preferring_35s45s_shots_on_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) talking about shot times . I came to the same conclusion and was thinking about all the other quirks / tips I encountered over the time I have used it. This is a list of things that are hopefully useful for new users. I've played with the shower screen, puck screen, new tamp, baskets, distribution tools, new grinder etc. but these are the things that I found were most impactful.

First of all, the way the Profitec Go stock is actually REALLY good. There is really no need to upgrade anything, just use it the way it is until you want to buy some new toys. Here are my list of tips and I'll talk about upgrades later.

**Tips / Tricks:**

\#1 Before pulling a shot, run water through the portafilter, this helps not only pre-heat the portafilter it also primes the lines. If you do milk drinks like me, the last time the valve was set was probably to the wand to steam milk. Running water through the portafilter directs the water towards the group head, helps heat everything up and puts some water through those water lines and reduces the amount of air pockets leading up to the puck before pulling a the shot. This is just a quirk with these single boiler machines, where the boiler has to do 2 things. My shots got more consistent after doing this step and takes a bit less time to ramp up the set pressure when pulling hosts.

\#2 Leave the stock pressure at 10 bar with the blind filter (comes this way from the factory). This will lead to 9 bar dynamic pressure through the puck. Also the pressure gauge is not right before the puck so there is no real way to tell the real pressure at the puck. SO LEAVE IT at 10 bar, there is a pressure drop after the pressure gauge. I tried playing with the pressure did it not lead me to more consistent shots. Good puck prep and tip #1 lead me to more consistent shots. I tried playing with pressure and it did not help for me.

\#3 Set your steamer to 140C. Before steaming milk, bleed the water out of the wand twice. I know the manual says 5 seconds twice or whatever. The way I do it is purge the water out of the steam wand until boiler temperature drops to 130C, then it goes back up to 140C and then empty the wand again until it drops to 130C. Wait until the boiler gets to 140C again and then steam milk. I know some people upgrade the nozzle to a single hole one. IMO practice latte art is more important. I attached some pictures of my progress over 1.5 years. Tip #3 + Lance Hendrick video + TIME (practice) + stock Profitec Go is how I got my results.

\#4 Descale your boilers occasionally. I put citric acid into the water tank. I cleaned mine after 1 year, probably waited a bit too long. I noticed after cleaning that my temperatures got to target a lot faster. Likely because the scale build up insulates the heating element a bit. I try to do Cafiza clean once ever month but that doesn't help descaling the boiler, in fact the Cafiza doesnt even get to the boiler, just the valve.

\#5 I tried those fancy spinning distribution tools but ended just grinding into a cup that fits my porta filter, shaking it up and using a needle WDT tool for the surface. Blind shaker leads to more consistent shots as demonstrated by Lance, but I just make sure its shaken before putting into the portafilter. Don't go crazy on these fancy distribution tools, waste of money and doesn't lead to more consistent shots. I think the biggest problem is those spinny tools pentrate the puck completely and don't work its way up to the surface like if you were do it by hand. If you do it by hand you sort of start at the bottom an work your way up, where as those spinny ones just full penetrate throughout the spin, and then you pull it off. When you pull it off there is a hole from top to bottom of the puck.

\#6 Time your shots based on when liquid hits the cup, NOT the Profitec time. If you use the Profitec timer you'll be off by about 8 seconds compared to what everyone else is suggesting. So if your aiming for 18g coffee in and 36g out in 30 seconds. Start a separate timer when the espresso hits the cup and aim for 30 seconds OR aim for about 38 seconds in Profitec timer time. The reason for this is the Profitec Go naturally has a longer ramp up. Maybe the pumps aren't as strong or the way the water lines are routed. If you aim for 30 seconds Profitec timer time I've always had shots that were too fast and/or under extracted. Fast shots also lead to really inconsistent shots from my experience. If you are aiming for 30 second profitec time shots, they will always be faster than what you are actually aiming for. If the shot is running faster that means the grind is not as fine. If it isn't as fine then there is likely more channeling. Channeling leads to unpredictable flow paths through the puck and leads to unpredictable shot times.

**Upgrades**

Shower Screen - Don't bother upgrading this, just do tip #1 and you should be fine. The key here is even PRESSURE through the puck not even drizzle through the puck. Espresso isn't pour over. Pour over you need to be more careful with how the water hits the coffee grounds and how it flows. Espresso just needs to make sure there is even pressure through the puck which is very different. I tried upgrading the shower screen and the result was no change at all. The videos of people showing how water flows out of the shower screen don't show anything, especially when using a puck screen. The puck screen should help disperse the water evenly when the puck is ramping up in pressure, and keep the coffee grounds flat at the top.

Puck Screen - YES I would do this. Keeps your group head a bit cleaner, lets the pressure build up faster by filling up the head a bit,

Fancy distribution tools - don't bother, just use a needle distribution and try to shake your grounds before putting it into the puck. I tried the fancy ones and just resulted going the cheapest route. Shaking grounds + 3d printed WDT is what I use.

Bottomless Portafilter + Basket - Bottomless portaftiler is pretty nice for seeing if there is channeling, and just watching the espresso come out is kind of fun, but honestly not needed for good tasting espresso. Also the stock basket is really good. I upgraded to the IMS basket and didn't notice anything different. I think the stock basket is actually built by VST. I think someone mentioned on r/espresso somewhere.

Grouphead Gasket - Yes I would replace the stock black one to the red silicone one. The black one historically has known to dry out and crack much faster. It's used on other profitec product liens as well. It's not a rush to do this one as the black one will last a while. Use up the stock black one for a year before upgrading to one of those red silicone ones.

Tamper - The stock tamper is pretty good, I use the normcore one though because it is auto leveling. I don't like making sure the tamp is level by feel. I don't think there is a big difference though if you can focus on keeping your tamp level, which is not my case in the mornings. I think Hoffman did a video of different tamp angles and I think you have to be off by at least 15 degrees to start noticing a difference. So there is quite a bit of wiggle room if you're using the stock tamp.

I hope this helps new Profitec Go users. I've done quiet a bit of trial and error to find out the stock machine is actually really legit. It just has some quirks that you have to figure out over time.

**My current setup if you're curious**

Profitec Go + IMS Shower Screen, Generic puck screen, 3D printed threaded WDT, Normcore Tamper, Red silicone group head gasket. 

DF64V + 3D printed lid that replace the wood lid and fits can also fit on top of the  Normcore dosing cup so I can shake it + 3d printed holder that holds the normcore dosing cup under the grinder, spray bottle for RDTing beans

I'll take some pics of my setup if you're curious. I designed some 3d printed stuff that might be useful to others.

1. Paint everything around you Sea Foam Green (Navy NSN Green, no substitutions) or Off-White to ensure you live in a clean, happy environment. Every Friday, set an alarm on loud for a short, but hated, drill sound. Then get up and manned only with a bucket, sponge, and a greeny. Clean one area over and over, even if it is already spotless.
2. Repeat back everything spoken to you. Repeat back everything spoken to you.
3. Sit in your car for six hours at a time with the motor running. Keep your hands on the wheel. But don‚Äôt leave your driveway. Log readings of your oil pressure, water temperature, speedometer, and odometer every 15 minutes.
4. Buy a trash compactor; use it only once a week. Store the rest of the garbage in your bathroom.
5. Don‚Äôt watch movies except in the middle of the night. Have your family vote on which movie to watch, then show a different one.
6. Wake up at midnight every night and make a peanut butter sandwich, using stale bread. For more credit, make your own bread, but cut 3-inch thick slices and use these. Optional: warm up some canned Ravioli or soup.
7. Use 18 scoops of coffee per pot and allow it to sit for 5 to six hours before drinking it.
8. Every so often, yell ""EMERGENCY DEEP!"" run into the kitchen and sweep all pots, pans, and dishes off of the counters onto the floor, and then yell at your family for not having the kitchen area ""Stowed for Sea!""
9. Put on the stereo headphones (don‚Äôt plug them in), go to the stove and stand in front of it. Say (to no one in particular) ""Stove manned and ready,"" and stay there for 3 to 4 hours. Say (once again and to no one in particular) ""Stove secured"", then roll up your headphone cord and put them away.
10. Pull out your refrigerator and clean behind it for 4 hours, and then put it back when you are done. Have your family come and check every 10 minutes with a flashlight to see how you are doing.

**>>>>>>>>>> SUMMARIES <<<<<<<<<<**

[**Mercury's**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-in-glass_thermometer) **Moods:**¬† It's fall, and Hans Castorp is head-over-heels in love with Frau Chauchat! Just a simple *hello* or *merci* from [that little red-haired girl](https://youtu.be/RwHa5dLYaMA?si=tUm2FJGALL_04BIJ) brings him ecstasy!¬† With great chivalry, he rescues her from sunlight in the dining room by drawing the curtains. He tries catching her eye by loudly conversing with Joachim and Hermine Kleefeld on the patio, but she looks at him disdainfully. This causes such a depression in Hans that his temperature normalizes - the horror! One day, he forces Joachim to hike extra fast to catch up to her, and - victory! - he is able to get a friendly nod in response to his greeting. Not exactly pencil shavings, but it raises his temperature back up to a simmering 100!¬†

**Encyclopedia:** The sanatorium residents are waiting for their Sunday mail when Herr Settembrini pulls Hans Castorp aside to debate with him. Herr Settembrini has been invited to contribute to an [encyclopedia of human suffering](https://encyclopedia.uia.org/). The goal is to encourage self-perfection so that society can eliminate all societal ills, which is considered the root of all suffering. Settembrini and Hans Castorp discuss the differences between the body and the mind, practical and intellectual work, natural forces and human reason. Settembrini warns Hans Castorp that as an engineer, Hans is unable to contribute to the elimination of human suffering up on the mountain where only intellectual work can be pursued, and it would be better to return to the flatlands where he can improve himself and society, even if it threatens his physical health. He also warns Hans not to be changed by the ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù proclivities of so many of the guests, who behave in ways Settembrini considers base and unsophisticated.¬†

**Humaniora:**¬† Hans Castorp and Joachim are enjoying another October day when Director Behrens comes along.¬† Behrens and Hans wax poetic about their mutual [love of cigars](https://cigarobsession.com/2018/08/08/maria-mancini-magic-mountain-maduro-cigar-review/) and then Hans asks the director about his painting hobby.¬† Behrens enthusiastically invites the cousins to view his paintings right away, and they head to his home to indulge in art, cigarettes, [Turkish coffee](https://www.foodandwine.com/coffee/how-to-make-turkish-coffee), and long speeches about medical topics.¬† They compare the professions concerned with studying humanity ([*humaniora*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humaniora)), which straddle the line between art and science.¬† Behrens has painted Frau Chauchat, which obviously fascinates Hans Castorp.¬† The painting itself is amateurish and mediocre, but Behrens has used his medical knowledge to help capture her skin realistically.¬† Noting this, Hans gets way too into learning the details of human anatomy, physiology, and chemistry - he learns about fat, blood, lymph, rigor mortis, etc.¬† The two men conclude that life is death, the difference being that as matter is transformed during life, the form is retained.¬† Hans is really keyed up and declares he could have been a great doctor because life - and, therefore, illness and death - interest him so much!¬† Joachim would rather be taking his rest cure, which he really needs.

**Research:**¬† Winter arrives, and with it the realization that Hans Castorp will be missing Christmas at home as he remains in the sanatorium.¬† The patients start planning how to sneak out and enjoy some of the sports and other pastimes of the healthy visitors to the ski slopes and lodges just below them, including [skijoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skijoring).¬† Reading is also a popular pastime at the sanatorium, what with all the resting and long stretches of time to fill, and sometimes a book becomes so popular that everyone fights over it.¬† Currently, people are vying for a turn with *~~Fifty Shades of Grey~~* *The Art of Seduction* which is causing quite a stir.¬† Hans Castorp is doing his own hot and spicy reading one evening - he‚Äôs learning all about the medical origins of life in its gory details.¬† Despite the cold and its ill effects on his breathing and rising temperature, Hans lingers on the balcony to read.¬† As he researches cells and reproduction and human anatomy, he envisions a female form standing before him.¬† (We get a very detailed breakdown of the medical facts Hans Castorp learns as he investigates the beginnings of life, concepts of consciousness, and pathology and death.¬† I will not try to summarize or explain these details because, unlike Hans, I would ***not*** have made a very good doctor and gotten super obsessed with medical textbooks.)¬† Hans even seems to consider engineering to be his *former* profession at this point.¬† He is learning to see the relationship between the science of structure that he learned when studying to be an engineer and its corresponding structures in human physiology.¬† Hans isn‚Äôt any closer to figuring out the meaning of life, but he does experience - or imagine - a kiss from the female form that he envisioned leaning over him as he read his heavy research book.¬†

**Danse Macabre:**¬† Christmas arrives and Hans Castorp is surprised to find that the holiday does little to break the routines of the sanatorium guests.¬† The biggest disruption seems to come from the visit by Director Behren‚Äôs son Knut, who all the ladies go wild over.¬† On Christmas, there is a real concert put on, and Hans finds he can only enjoy the music after the departure of Frau Chauchat at the intermission.¬† Settembrini, too, leaves early after making fun of the performances a bit.¬† Shortly after Christmas, the Austrian horseman dies and Hans finds that he wants to talk about it.¬† This is strictly against the rules, and Frau St√∂hr is irate.¬† In response, Hans becomes determined to visit the Austrian horseman‚Äôs room to pay his respects and pray before the body is removed.¬† He drags Joachim along, of course.¬† The widow and Hans have a long conversation, and Hans is so moved by the moral and spiritual benefits that he comes up with a new plan.¬† To defend human dignity and improve the moral nature of the sanatorium, Hans (and Joachim) will begin to pay more attention to the seriously ill and moribund patients that are usually kept completely separate from the social wing and its less ill guests.¬† They will send flowers anonymously, followed by brief social calls.¬† Not only is it the right thing to do, Hans muses, but it would be medically interesting as well.¬† Behrens approves their plan even though it breaks the rules.¬† Hans and Joachim visit many patients and hear their stories, and most of them die within days of their encounter with the cousins, who gain a reputation as ‚Äúyoung cavaliers‚Äù.¬†¬†

Hans is pleased with the moral progress and spiritual uplift that he and the moribund patients all seem to gain from these visits.¬† There are several obstacles, however.¬† First is the fact that many of the sanatorium residents persist in behaving in scandalous ways, having affairs and gambling and carousing.¬† Then, there is the awful Frau St√∂hr, whose use of malapropisms and slang, her love of gossip and scandal, and her mood swings over the progress of her illness seem trivial and insulting to Hans Castorp‚Äôs defense of human dignity.¬† A new patient, who suffers from epilepsy, also creates an affront to Hans‚Äô spiritual striving when one of his seizures causes such a disruption during a meal that many of the women begin to carry on with their own ‚Äúconditions‚Äù and flee the dining room.¬† Hans is shocked that the man is able to recover in only a short time and soon rejoins his wife and finishes the meal.¬† Although concerned for the man‚Äôs health and safety, Hans Castorp is also struck by the ‚Äúfrivolous slovenliness‚Äù highlighted by the incident, and determines to renew his efforts to befriend the moribund.¬† One particular favorite of Hans (and Joachim) is a teenage girl named Karen Karstedt, a destitute private outpatient that lives on her cousins‚Äô charity and remains near the sanatorium at the insistence of Director Behrens.¬† Through the winter, Hans and Joachim go on frequent outings with Karen:¬† they hike the Alpine countryside, attend winter sporting events, go to the movies, and visit caf√©s.¬† Karen is delighted by it all, and Hans is delighted at her delight.¬† In February, the three spend time together alongside Frau St√∂hr, who cannot seem to figure out what the trio‚Äôs real relationship to each other is.¬† She suggests that Hans is using Karen as a meager substitute since he cannot find a way to tell Frau Chauchat of his feelings, and Hans admits to himself that this is somewhat true, but he thinks *all* of the moribund patients he visits provide him with a distraction and an outlet for his time and attentions.¬† Walking with Karen one afternoon, Hans decides they should stroll through the local cemetery despite Joachim‚Äôs concerns that this is inappropriate for Karen‚Äôs sake.¬† They see many gravestones marked with very short lifespans. Then they find a plot where no one has been buried yet and Karen is observed to be smiling.¬†

**Walpurgis Night**:¬† At this point, Joachim has been at the sanatorium for an entire year, and Hans Castorp is approaching seven months of residence.¬† He reflects on the importance of holidays to keep time moving smoothly along, from Christmas to New Years and now on to [Mardi Gras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardi_Gras), which will lead to [Midsummer Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer) before they know it.¬† Settembrini makes his usual mocking style of commentary and alludes to the irony of celebrating a holiday with [*danses macabres*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyknBTm_YyM) amongst people who may very well be dead by the next celebration.¬† On the day of Mardi Gras, the guests go all out with drunken revelry that includes masquerade, ridiculous costume changes, music, parlor games, and illicit dancing! Settembrini goes around quoting poems and people are passing cryptic verses written in pencil, including one about a ‚Äúmountain mad with spells‚Äù from Settembrini to Hans. (Here‚Äôs [an analysis of Goethe‚Äôs *Faust* ](https://www.gradesaver.com/goethes-faust/study-guide/summary-walpurgis-night-walpurgis-nights-dream-gloomy-day-field-night-open-field-dungeon)\- beware of spoilers - which is where this verse is drawn from and from which the chapter title ‚ÄúWalpurgis Night‚Äù derives.) You know things are out of control because people are ***using familiar pronouns***!!! Behrens even gets in on the fun, serving a brown [arrack punch](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/good-eats-company-punch-recipe-1948159) while wearing a Turkish fez.¬† The director also introduces a parlor game where people try to draw a pig while blindfolded, resulting in ridiculous and indecipherable images.¬† The game becomes wildly popular, and when it is Hans Castorp‚Äôs turn, he declares that the stubby pencil he is handed is unacceptable.¬† He begins shouting for a proper pencil and weaving through the rooms, heading straight for Frau Chauchat who is wearing a new sleeveless dress that shows off her sickly, pale arms.¬† Things come full circle for Hans as he musters the courage to ask Clavdia for a pencil, which she produces along with a warning for him to be careful with it (just like Hippe, although her decorative pencil is much different than the school boy‚Äôs practical one).¬† They begin to talk about poetry, order, and freedom - Germans like Hans value order while Clavdia cherishes her freedom, which has been granted to her by her illness.¬†¬†

Reality comes crashing down for Hans Castorp as Clavdia drops two bombs:¬† Joachim (and Settembrini) are sicker than Hans seems to realize, and she is leaving the sanatorium the next day after dinner.¬† She wishes they had talked intimately like this earlier in her stay, but she has been here a whole year and even if she returns, Hans is unlikely to be around since his own condition is so minor. (Hans disagrees, and also thinks his own lovesick condition is just as serious as his cousin‚Äôs tuberculosis, in any case.)¬† Hans is overcome by her looming departure, and he finds himself on his knees declaring his eternal love for Clavdia.¬† He expresses how speaking to her so intimately is like a dream for him and he raves about the relationship between illness and love, love and death, death and life until Clavdia tells him it is a bit too much.¬† She predicts that his [fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYxoAJ3Boyc) will be much higher after this, then says goodbye and leaves the room with a final reminder to return her [pencil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vViMeAkOsv8).",5,1737233047.0,bookclub,20,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day.

But basically I'm writing a book, and I started it with the FMC's perspective. I was like half asleep today and it hit me that it would be more compelling(??) easier for me to write(??) from the MMC's perspective instead. The book is a romance/murder mystery. 

MMC is a father of one, and a widower. He's a detective on the police force and had to move to a new city. He meets the FMC there in a coffee shop meet cute kinda scenario. The book will explore his mindset and struggles with raising his son and dealing with the loss of his wife. It will also explore him accepting that it's okay to love again with the FMC. the book will have explicit scenes of the MMC alone and with the FMC. 

So my question is, would this appeal to men? Is it something anyone here would be interested in? I'd also like to know what else is popular here ‚ô• thank you!! And pls be kind lol ",7,1737232831.0,Romance_for_men,10,0.89,False

1i4gpl1,https://i.redd.it/wufc8yj1ctde1.png,Cubot is Dead- Copypasta theory.,"It all started with an innocent video called ""Sonic x Shadow: Twitter Takeover"". During it, a question arises about what Sonic and Shadow think of Orbot and Cubot. At the end of the answer, Orbot himself appears, offering them coffee. Then... I fell off my chair. ""Where's Cubot?! They always stick together!"" - I thought. Then, something hit me. What if Cubot died? After all, why else wouldn't he serve coffee with his friend? Sonic didn't say anything about Cubot being dead, but he didn't have to know, right? I dismissed my suspicions for a moment, explaining to myself that maybe Cubot was busy with something with Eggman. Unfortunately. It turns out that over time, more and more evidence has come to light. The latest episode of Tailtube about the New Year is a perfect example. Tails connects with a few characters there, asking them about their New Year's resolutions. The character who connects with him at one point is Orbot. AGAIN. It's not Orbot and Cubot.  And Orbot himself! Where's the other one? They were inseparable! It's impossible for him to be so busy building his car for Sonic Racing: Crossworlds... right? Orbot's words alone are also disturbing. Before Tails rudely hung up on him (I was very offended. I swear. We're nicer in Eggman Empire), he asks if he can tell you about his resolutions. Why would he do that if Cubot was somewhere near him? He seemed so sad saying that. As if he was looking for support. Mental help. Comfort!  As if the friend he always shared resolutions with was no longer by his side...

In that case, I started to wonder when was the last time we saw Cubot? 
He certainly couldn't have died before Frontiers, because Sage mentions wanting to meet them, and Eggman doesn't correct her that one of her brothers is already dead. As it turns out, Cubot's last real appearance is in ""The Murder of Sonic The Hedgehog"".  In this masterpiece, he appears at the end in Eggman's base, as a cheerful and lively robot. The next game after ""TMOSTH"" is Sonic Dream. While I didn't play it, due to the lack of an Apple phone, I quickly looked through all the cutscenes for further evidence and guess what? My GOAT Cubot is not there! Orbot of course is also gone, but his absence can be explained by being busy mourning his buddy. And before you say ""But we saw Cubot in Shadow Generations!"", remember that this game takes place during Sonic Generations. Many years before Cubot's potential death after Frontiers and ""TMOSTH"". 

So asking me how Cubot died? What happened? Personally... I have a clue though. 
The last thing Cubot does on screen is drawing a bath for Eggman, along with Cubot. What if he fell into that bath and died? We don't know if he's waterproof.  Sure, many of Eggman's robots can withstand contact with water, but shouldn't ""Cubot"", a robot literally named after ""cube"", go down? Perhaps his design and name from the beginning symbolized a square going down in the water?
Maybe, we'll see the details of this ""Fatal Bathtub Incident"" in the IDW comics, once the story moves beyond Frontiers?

At this point, I'm certain that Cubot is no longer with us. Eggman didn't rebuild him. Probably focusing more on Sage, and Orbot was left all alone... It's a truly tragic story and maybe the saddest death in the series, right next to the death of Eggman Nega (Also, unseen on screen).
So don't be surprised if in Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, Orbot is all alone, or not at all, because he sinks into a depression that causes him to lose his driver's license...

Today Verge Of Tears. ,"Yesterday I went to the blood lab to do some fasting blood work in the morning. I drank some water to hydrate and went. I was feeling good. Little nervous as I don't know many fans of needles.

So I get a new trainee phlebotomist to do it. She is fine. Needs some help from the main phlebotomist. As soon as she comes over to take over I feel like my body is vibrating. My fingers and feet. I kept putting my hand in front of my face to see if it was trembling like I felt it was. It was shaking a bit but not how I felt. My entire body sweat.

The nurse came over and they got me into a reclining chair and I bent my knees. I was feeling like shit but I was still in a somewhat happy mood. I was cracking jokes and trying to stay positive. The nurse and I were chatting as I was drinking some water and snacking on some animal crackers. 

About 20 minutes later they took my blood and I was out of there. I was freezing the walk to the parking lot where my ride was waiting. The rest of the day I just felt off but good enough. 

Skip to today. I am ok. Woke up and had my coffee, took my meds, and ate some breakfast. Started thinking about my upcoming week and how I'm starting college at almost 40 on Wednesday and what I needed to get before that.

Now I'm on the verge of tears for about an hour or two. don't want to cry. I'm not in a place where I can let it out. What do you do or would do in this situation? Eventually when I get back home later I'll probably have a nice little break down and cry. Release it.

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started!

I found myself in a relationship straight out of high school, which lasted for about 8 years. The past couple of years I've worked on myself a bit more. I have a few dating app profiles, but nothing that really ever went anywhere and honestly between finishing school full time and work full time there just wasn't much time. And it's a bit embarrassing to admit, but I'm realizing that for the self-growth I have no idea what I'm doing.

I met someone (26F) I'd like to ask out, but I cant really find a good way to. We'd ran into each before at events, so enough to recognize each other. By chance we ran into each other again at an event about a month ago. My friends had already gone off to do their own thing and they invited me to hang out with their group. They were fun and we've exchanged a couple short messages since then, but nothing major. I'm not trying to do anything big. I really just would like to see if they'd like to hang out or a grab a coffee or something. 

My problem is finding an opening. The times we've ran into each other and when they invited me to join their group, they weren't working the events or it was after they were done working. Recently though, their busy season has started and so while we still occasionally still run into each at events and talk for a few minutes, the fact of the matter is they are currently working when that happens. I don't feel comfortable asking someone out while they are working. While we have messaged a couple times, I don't know if it's really enough that it wouldn't be a bit weird to send one out the blue seeing if they'd want to hang out the next time I'm in town. 

Is there an easier way to go about this? Am I just overthinking things? Or should I just kind of accept that I really should have asked when we hung out before, and shelve it?

I knew my mother would think I‚Äôm overreacting so I just took some vitamin fizzies that my mom always has at home which should‚Äôve made me feel just a smidge better but nothing. I asked her if we could go to our house doctor because my friend at the time who is a third year med student is starting to think I have iron deficiency anemia. She mother said yes, we just need to go to the doctor who‚Äôs closer because I explained that I‚Äôd need to have my blood drawn for an iron deficiency test, and so my mother called the local doctor and the receptionist just never got back to us and I‚Äôve been repeatedly asking my mother to just call her back when she has time and she always she‚Äôll do it later but never does. 

For some context, money is not an issue here because we have health insurance. However, I do think she isn‚Äôt going through with this because of her financial anxiety. When I was growing up and still to this day, if I asked for something no matter how big or small it was the answer was always ‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt have money for that‚Äù even if we did. Now money is a little tight and I‚Äôm a little upset that my mom won‚Äôt even talk to her boss about a raise or send her resume to other companies (which is the better option because her current employer is liquidating the company) because right now I am on my bed and I‚Äôm drinking coffee with milk to avoid the cramps from how hungry I am. I‚Äôm so confused about her anger with my sister too, my sister recently got a job and is doing really well and with her money she buys take out because she knows we actually never have food (we scratch up 3-4 meals a week, only dinner) and my mom is mad that my sister isn‚Äôt saving her money and ‚Äúwasting‚Äù it on McDonald‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Girly pop WE ARE STARVING!!!

I‚Äôm starting to think this is a lack of consideration thing, because my mother eats like a mouse. If she‚Äôs hungry during the day then she‚Äôll make some toast and that‚Äôs it, then she won‚Äôt eat again until tomorrow. But I‚Äôm sure you can see what this lack of having is doing to me mentally- I‚Äôve had an eating disorder before, and I feel like it might be coming back, usually when we do have money and we buy snacks and food then I feel guilty for eating it because the money my mom spent to buy this could‚Äôve gone to something more important, like getting the breaks in her car fixed, so to avoid that guilt I‚Äôve stopped asking for it. I‚Äôm just so confused and I can‚Äôt do anything but wait to leave the house so I can finally just be cared for, even if I‚Äôm the one taking care of myself. But I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting because I don‚Äôt understand her work situation, I am just a 16 year old who‚Äôs only worry in life is too much homework and boys, as she would say. Am I overreacting? I just wanna eat something and be satisfied with my relationship with food but my mother is stressed because of money, I just don‚Äôt know when she‚Äôll change the situation because I do need her care I‚Äôm still a kid.

# INTRODUCTION

What is waiting, except expectation? Nothing more than nothing. The game's name was ""Hollow Knight"", and i feel that all of us have become one. The pain we have gone through. The pain that is left. It's all because of a video game... Pixels on a screen. When I talk about the pain, I'm not only talking about our pain, as silkposter. I'm talking about everyone involved in this. Do you think XBOX liked when they thought the game would come out in a year? Do you think Nintendo likes it? Do you think Leth is enjoying this? And, most importantly... Do you think Team Cherry themselves like to keep doing the game?

Of course, that's something that they can control (the amount of time that passes before the release, that is), but something they can't control, at the same time. Here is my thesis: the more time that passes, the more hype there is, and the more time it has to pass to meet the fans' expectations. Or at least that what I'm assuming they're thinking.

When it inevitably comes out, I don't know what will happen to this community. I can't really predict it, as I'm not a prophet (I'm not Satin Polar, after all), but I think that a lot of people will be upset. The one thing that I can say for sure is that E1331 will finally have to get a job.

Waiting, expectation...

What is it that we truly seek? Are we really waiting for the game anymore? I feel like a lot of us got lost in the way and aren't even waiting for it anymore: we are now waiting for it to be over.

I don't want the game anymore. I don't want a release date. I just want to stop the insanity that Team Cherry has brought upon us.

After a long, restless sleep, I woke up transformed into a bug. Feeling dizzy, I tried to get up, but my legs couldn't stand the weight of my body. Confused, I looked at them. They were all harmed, like someone came in with a bat and started beating them.

But the fact was, there wasn't a door someone could've entered the room. The walls were all completely blank, with no decorations or windows. The only furniture in the room was the mattress where I was laying.

Suddenly, I saw something in the middle of the cube-shaped room. A chocolate cake with a card.

""This all has to be a dream"", I thought. ""My usual room has windows, bookshelves, a desk with my computer and a chair"".

I then looked at my body.

""What is going on with this bug shit, anyways?""

I made another attempt to stand up. Feeling hungry, my intention was to reach for the cake and eat it. The last meal I remembered having was yesterday.

""Yesterday..."", I thought, before using my arms to rotate my body to be sideways in the mattress. Using all the strength I had, I pushed my arms and successfully stood up, before falling down on the cold floor. Looking at my legs, they were still harmed, seemingly without repair.

Laying down on the cold floor, the only thing I could think of was the chocolate cake in front of me.

""Guess I'll have to do it with my arms, then"", I said before using my small arms to push my self towards the cake.

Suddenly, there was someone in front of me. I looked up at them, noticing I was the same height as them, just that I was a battered bug and they were a normal person.

Before I even said anything, the person started attacking me. They hit me in the face, the torso, the legs... Everything but the arms.

""STOOOOP!"", I screamed. ""PLEEASEEE!""

But they didn't stop. In fact, they started hitting even harder.

Minutes, hours, days passed, until they disappeared in the bat of an eye.

Feeling excruciating pain all over my body, I tried to make one last push towards the cake. And another. And another. Each movement feeling even more painful than the last, and every ounce of hope of reaching the cake before my death vanishing.

Until I did it.

I had the cake right in front of my face. I had made it. I could finally eat it.I tried to grab a piece of it with my hand, but then... I noticed it was a rock.

Confused, I tried again. And again. And again. And again.

I screamed. I screamed more than I have ever screamed in my entire life. In tears, I prayed that someone would save me. But no one came.

Eventually, I grabbed the card that was beside the cake. It read: ""The cake is a lie"".

\*\*\*

I woke up. My computer screen was in front of me.

""Thank god it's over"", I thought. ""What a nightmare.""

Then I looked at the screen. It was a tweet from fireborn that said:

""Leth reached out to me to confirm there was no Silksong ARG and that the changes to William's account and the tweet were a nothingburger. Apologies to have misled everyone. The cake was a lie.""

I was so wrong. The nightmare wasn't over.

A train was riding from Switzerland to Saint Petersburg. There were two young men on one of the compartments.

One of them looked like he wanted to talk. He had blonde hair and blue eyes. His clothes didn't look too expensive, but they didn't look cheap either. At first glance, he would've seemed like an innocent man, for his facial expressions and voice.

The other one was the complete opposite. He had black, curly hair and brown eyes, and his clothes looked worse than the first one's. Not because they were cheap, but because of how worn out they were. He had a serious expression and was immersed in the reading of a newsletter.

When the second one was done with the newspaper, the first asked:

""Any news?"", he said.

""Apart from another silkpost from E1331, not much."", the other replied.

""I still can't believe we haven't gotten official news in such a long time"", the first one said. ""Aren't they afraid that the hype will eventually disappear?""

The second one smirked, and said:

""Do you really think that the hype will ever run out?""

""No... but there will definitely be less hype if they keep acting like this"", the first one said, almost as if he was embarrassed of what he had said earlier. ""Do you think they really are still working on it?""

""Of course."", said the one with brown eyes. ""What I don't know is if it's worth the wait""

""No cost too great."", the first one quoted.

""Except death, in this case.""

They sat in silence for a few seconds.

Then the blonde one said:

""Maybe they shouldn't have announced it that early""

""And maybe we shouldn't have even created hype surrounding it... but talking about 'ifs' is useless now"".

They sat in silence again.

And the train kept going, and going, and going... But it never reached Saint Petersburg.

Two persons sat in a cafe located in a busy street. There was a great ambience. The noise of the people talking with each other was soothing, almost like it was a calm melody that reminded you that you aren't alone in this world.

""A cup of coffee, please"", said one of them.

""Make it two""

The noise kept going.

One of the persons was a relatively young man, who was tall and would be considered attractive by most people. The other one was the complete opposite. It was an old man, who seemed to have his days counted. He wore glasses, and always had a serious expression, in contrast to the young man, who was smiling all the time and seemed to be happy.

""I saw the way you looked at that waiter"", the old one said.

""Oh come on."", said the young man, laughing. ""Do you have any problem with it?""

The noise kept going.

The old man chose not to reply to his question. They sat in silence for a few seconds. Then, the old man said:

""Time has worn me out, kid. Don't think that everything I say is really me...I lost myself on the way here""

""But you only live two streets away"", replied the young man.

""Do I?"", said the old man, acting like he didn't know. ""Either way, I wasn't talking about that. Everything I've lived, everything I've gone through... It's all gone now. I achieved everything I wanted to, and I did everything I ever desired. But what do I have left, now that it's all over?""

The young man suddenly felt unwell.

""Don't say that. You aren't dead yet."", he replied.

""Oh, don't say that"", the old man said. ""I was already dead the moment I was born""

The young man started to feel even worse.

""I never had a choice. I knew this moment would come, and I only decided to keep going because of this exact reason""

The young man felt like he was drowning in the noise. He felt it get louder and louder. His vision started to fail, and then turned completely black. It felt like an eternity before he slowly recovered.

""Guess they aren't bringing the coffee anytime soon, huh"", the old man said.

# Conclusion

Yes, the cake might have been a lie. But remember to not get too upset by it. We have already waited a long time, but i feel like this might be the last stretch.

I'd like to end with a note of hope. I'm sure that when the game comes out it will be great and we will all enjoy it. Who knows, maybe we will even miss these times, when we still had Hollow Knight content confirmed.

It opens smack dab with an intense coffee smell, and it‚Äôs not a bitter espresso but a lovely, dark, smooth, fresh brewed, caramel coffee. That caramel is sweet, but not sickly or cloying, IMO.

The amber I think ties everything together nicely, but it‚Äôs not the star of the show by any means. 

NOW, this part is for those of you who said it was gonna smell like pancakes or freaking curry ü§£ I think that amber, caramel, and vanilla gives it a maple syrup touch, like I can see what you mean, but my nose doesn‚Äôt smell it separately from the coffee note, so I don‚Äôt get that gourmand-y breakfast-y vibe aside from, drinking coffee is associated with breakfast time.

1i4gfwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1i4gfwl/moka_pot_leaking_from_threads/,Moka pot leaking from threads?,"Not sure if anyone has done this before but I figured id make this post for anyone who runs into this problem because it seems very common. I‚Äôve been using a moka pot for almost a decade and this still happens to me occasionally. 

If anyone has anything to add or if you disagree with anything, please comment!

Main reasons for the leaking:

- old gasket. 
- new gasket is too stiff. 
- coffee grounds or other material in threads preventing a good seal. 
- coffee is ground too fine and clogging the top screen, forcing pressure to the threads and valve. 
- threads or funnel filter are warped/damaged. 
-  top part is cross threaded. 

Solutions:
- replace old gaskets
- break in new gaskets by *overtightening* the top a few times before using in full capacity (do not leave a moka pot overtightened for more than a few minutes).
- make sure grounds are not rounded over the top of the funnel or anywhere outside of the funnel/in the threads. 
- *grind coarser*
- replace damaged parts
- confirm the top is screwed correctly before bringing the pot to pressure 

I‚Äôll add edits as needed for more suggestions or alterations. ",7,1737231714.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

1i4gefv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrianThompsonMurder/comments/1i4gefv/where_was_bt_going_at_645_am_m_what_was_the/,"Where was BT going at 6:45 am m? What was the lead-up to his d**th like, and other thoughts ","Apologies if this has already been discussed, but I‚Äôve been pondering a few questions about BT and his whereabouts and behavior prior to his death. 

First, why was BT up and about at 6:45 am, which is more than an hour prior to the start of the 8 am UnitedHealth Group investor‚Äôs conference? He doesn‚Äôt appear to be wearing workout clothes, and could easily have grabbed coffee or water in his Marriott hotel instead of going out. Most conferences have catered meals, so I don‚Äôt believe he was going out for breakfast. Note: The Marriott and Midtown Hilton are 3-5 minutes of walking distance apart. 

This could be as simple as him taking an early morning walk, but he could have left at 7:30 am and taken a longer route to the Midtown Hilton to get 30 mins of exercise in. 6:45 am seems incredibly early for NYC in December. 

Imagine if BT was a woman: there would be sentiments about how she shouldn‚Äôt have been out alone, shouldn‚Äôt have been out in the dark, should have worn reflective clothing, etc. 

Either this was an early walk, plain and simple, or there was something or someone that prompted him to get dressed and leave his hotel so early. 

Second, he doesn‚Äôt appear to be holding a portfolio or laptop bag, which may rule out the possibility of him heading straight to the Midtown Hilton to set up a presentation or something. But as CEO, he probably has a whole team to set things up for him so my observation here may be moot. BT is wearing his suit jacket which means he was already dressed and ready. Was he heading somewhere other than the Midtown Hilton?

Third, the shooter had to have known BT‚Äôs morning routine and got very lucky with timing. Many folks have already talked about this online so I won‚Äôt go into it. 

Fourth, what were the weeks leading up to BT‚Äôs death like? Did he inadvertently share his schedule with the shooter? I mean, you can call or email an administrative assistant, pretend to be another executive, and piece together someone‚Äôs availability. ‚ÄúOh hi Sheryl. Ran into BT on the golf course and he told me to call in and schedule a Zoom. He‚Äôs open for meeting until noon right? And can you verify his mailing address? My wife is sending out Christmas cards, haha.‚Äù

Moreover, was BT ever in direct contact with his killer? Someone posing as enthusiastic reporter or prospective employee? 

Fifth, what if the shooter had missed their target? What if a mail delivery or cleaning crew had blocked the sidewalk? What if BT decided to sleep in? Would the shooter have tried again later that day? What if the cops caught the suspect immediately before they made their getaway? I‚Äôm curious about what the Plan B might have been and what contingencies were planned for. I find the combination of careful planning and reliance d elements of luck (ie BT‚Äôs timing and the expectation that he would exit from a specific door of the Marriott) to be really intriguing.

1i4gcuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1i4gcuj/surgery_success/,Surgery Success!,"Hi all - I‚Äôm another lurker, first time poster who‚Äôs been reading this sub religiously once I discovered I likely had gallstones. I just had surgery on Monday and just wanted to post about my experience so far since a lot of stories on the internet aren‚Äôt the best experience. 

33F. Overweight, but otherwise in good health. This was a scheduled laparoscopic surgery. 

I‚Äôd been having attacks for about a year with my first in January 2024. Me, being a dumbass, brushed it off as extremely bad heartburn for like 6 months until I finally googled the right combo of words that made everything click into place. I got confirmation of stones in October, saw a surgeon in mid December, and got it out this past Monday (1/13). 

This wasn‚Äôt my first surgery rodeo, so I wasn‚Äôt really nervous until I was literally about to transfer to the operating table lmao. The anesthesiologist gave me something to essentially take the edge off that made the ceiling spin (me: man, this is making me feel like I‚Äôm in college again!) and next thing I know I‚Äôm in the recovery room. If you‚Äôre nervous about going under, I can promise you that the anesthesiologists do their best to reduce your anxiety. You‚Äôll also get a consult with them before going in so you can meet them and ask any questions you may have. 

Waking up was a bit rougher than I anticipated because I had a burning feeling around the top incision. I think I rated it around like a 4-5? They gave me meds and that took the edge off. Apparently this is very normal. 

I ended up going to stay with my dad, who lives 2.5 hours away from me, because I live on my own in a studio.  If you have an option to have someone stay with you or to stay with someone, do it! It was honestly a big relief because all I wanted to do was sleep and not move. My surgeon only had me take Tylenol/Ibuprofen ‚Äî my dad had some 500mg Tylenol on hand and I brought some 600mg Ibuprofen from my wrist surgery last spring. The first day or two I was taking about 1000mg of Tylenol every time I could take it. I was definitely very very sore and had trouble getting up/getting into bed. The first 24 hours I could only have broth and of course, I need to be on a low fat, low cholesterol diet for 6 or so weeks. 

One thing I didn‚Äôt see anybody mention was that during the first 24 hours, it‚Äôs normal for you to bleed from your belly button. I was a little panicked because it seemed like a LOT of blood but it went away by Wednesday and it was more ‚Äúseepage‚Äù that looked like a lot due to how it collected. Also expect a looooot of bruising. I had some gas pain, but it wasn‚Äôt anything unbearable. Was constipated for a couple of days, but have been having normal BMs since then. And by normal, it‚Äôs not the loose, greasy, yellow grossness I was having pre-surgery. 

Tuesday, I started eating ‚Äúnormal‚Äù foods (though trying to limit fat) and have been extremely lucky so far that I‚Äôve been able to have my daily coffee, my oatmeal with blueberries (though made with water), etc. I‚Äôve mostly been eating chicken, some sort of veg, eggs, salmon, crackers, air fried sweet potatoes, etc. Anything that seems exceptionally fatty/rich (mashed potatoes üò≠ pilaf üò≠), I‚Äôve tried a few bites of to see how my body reacts ‚Äî no issues, but I don‚Äôt want to push it yknow. And drink looooots of water. If I dash food (due to my dad not wanting to cook or cooking something I can‚Äôt eat lol), I‚Äôve been requesting all dressings/sauces on the side so everything is as plain as possible. 


Today is day 5 and I‚Äôm generally just sore/bruised  still and haven‚Äôt taken many pain meds after day 3. I definitely didn‚Äôt realize how horrible I‚Äôd been feeling pre-surgery until I hit day 2/3 and was like ‚Äúwow I forgot what not having constant burning/back pain/etc felt like‚Äù. I‚Äôm honestly itching to get back to work (desk job) and even plan on trying to make it into the office at least 1 or two days next week (which will be days 8-10). Overall, I‚Äôm extremely happy I went through this!! I‚Äôm excited to see how I start feeling once I‚Äôm a few more weeks out; hopefully I‚Äôll continue to feel normal again. 

(Also - bc the app is being weird on my phone - bring a squishmallow/small pillow/fluffy towel/something for the first couple of days to hold against your stomach!! That tip saved me and I want to reiterate it lol)",4,1737231490.0,gallbladders,2,1.0,False
