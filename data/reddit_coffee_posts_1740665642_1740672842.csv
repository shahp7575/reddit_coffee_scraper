Do I try harder or go away?,"We’ve been in a relationship for 3 years already, 2 of these years we spent living and working abroad in a country we met in - we both knew living in this country is going to be temporary. From the beginning he was transparent he wants to live in his hometown which is tiny village in a country neighbouring with mine. I agreed to that even though I was apprehensive since I’m not a fan of the countryside. I love nature and outdoor activities but I prefer to live in a big city because I thrive much better in busy and fast environment. 1 year ago we moved to his house in the countryside, first problem I noticed was work since there are basically no jobs here, especially not for someone who doesn’t know the language fluently. Thankfully I was able to land corporate job in finance with possibility of working remotely for most of the time with only 4 days a month in the office in the city. I didn’t get even one 100% remote offer so I had to accept hybrid job even though my boyfriend wasn’t happy that I’m going to spend few days a month there. Other problems started to appear. I found out it’s super hard to find friends in a tiny village in a foreign country, especially when you’re 30 and most of the women your age around you already have children and groups of friends they’ve had since they were kids. Another thing is that I find village really boring. I am aware there are hundreds things to do around here, hiking, mountains, sports of all kind etc. but I miss just being able to go out of my house, jump onto the metro and go to a pub, cafe, theatre etc. Most of our free time here in the winter we spend on our phones or watching movies. I finish work at 5 when it’s already dark so outdoor activities are for weekends only. I feel suffocated, I am becoming depressed (I started SSRI which helps a bit) and I pick fights with my boyfriend because of it and I’m not proud of that. I love him a lot but I’m slowly losing my mind. He is trying to be understanding but as he hates the city, he can’t comprehend why do I prefer tiny flat in the city from huge house with garden in a countryside… he’s also telling me that it’s not boring here because there’s always something to do around the house, some outdoor activity etc. and if I wanna go for coffee I can drive to nearby town. I know he is right but for some reason I feel unmotivated to do anything at all and I am starting to wonder, should I try much harder to like it here or just have serious conversation with him about how I feel living in this place? We spoke about it several times and he told me I need to make the decision to stay or go by myself because he will not move from here and he was transparent about it from the beginning (I am aware of it and I obviously understand why he wants to live here and nowhere else). I am not sure about what my next steps should be. Should I let go or try hard to fall in love with the place even though my heart doesn’t feel it (yet)? 

TLDR: we live in my boyfriends hometown in a countryside, I struggle here and keep wondering if I can make it since I am definitely a city person. I am slowly starting going crazy. Should I try harder or my gut is telling me this place is not a good fit? ",2,1740672326.0,relationships,0,1.0,False
1izj8hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/1izj8hw/is_it_too_far_fetched_to_have_a_genitive_case_for/,"Is it too far fetched to have a genitive case for possess and also a construct state for associations between nouns that are not possessive in nature but would take syntactically genitive constructions in English, Spanish, or other PIE languages?","TL;DR I'm a horrible ADD mess with notes all over the place who abandons and revisits projects like a 'father who went out to get milk but still wants to feel good about being a father.'



This probably comes from some kitchen sink nonsense, because it's in a project that's 20+ years old that I dabble on then abandon for months to a few years at a time.



I know it's not necessary for a fic-lang to be naturalistic, but I care about this one being naturalistic. One of the problems I have in that realm is that I didn't originally start with a proto-language, and I kind of back constructed the proto after the project existed for a few years.



I think the original thought was that it would be neat to have speakers differentiate between possession and belonging vs other types of associations that aren't truly possessive/belonging.



I'm thinking things that might even be compounds in English, ""light side\[of The Force\]"", ""path of light"", ""coffee wizard (spells are not coffee based, they're just a caffeine fiend)"", ""camino de luz"", ""mago del café"".



This question honestly came about from looking at some old notes, where I had markers for both genitive and construct state. I was trying to name/translate something, and also realized that in a language that is supposed to be head-initial, I have primarily suffixes. That led me to a wild flurry of trying to figure out how to fix things, what to keep, what to change, and what to get rid of.



I think the original attempt at translation for ""coffee wizard"" was `coffee.CONST person.I` Class I is spiritual entities, paragon examples of a clade, ancestors and gods. Nouns are null marked for their native class. Then i realized I'd done the construction wrong. So I then went to `person.I coffee.CONST`. Realized, again that I'd gotten the construction wrong, but also had changing the word order trigger the realization that head-initial tends toward prefixing.



So, the next thing I did was abandon focus on the construction itself, and go into a focus on fixing the affixation issue. Not by just taking the suffixes and making them prefixes, but by figuring out how to get at it from the fictional/constructed history of the language. Eventually I came to either `CONST.person.I DEF.coffee.∅` or `DEF.person.I.coffee.GEN` and am thinking, in this case, I can just compound and be done with it `DEF.person.I.coffee.∅` or `DEF.person.coffee.I.∅`.",1,1740672312.0,conlangs,0,1.0,False

I have deviated septum which I think is the problem but here are rest of my symptoms.

I'm having back pain for 5 to 6 months the back pain is not serious or anything as far as I know it's just there I don't even notice it when I'm really thinking about it it's there and I can feel it. I know it sounds like a Fantasy type thing but that's best I can describe it.

I also have like neck popping thing also going around like when I move I can feel neck popping not crazy or any thing.

I some times have pressure/ pain very low around my eyes and nose I wear glasses btw


I got back x ray like 3 months ago but doctor said it's nothing and told me to exercise like work and move kind of.

I don't know if this is related but I have a less sense of feel like lower then other I think. I don't feel taste like how I think others feel, it is also hard for me to know if I have any problem with pain as I don't feel it very much like about 5 years ago I kicked a rock and got toes facture but it took me 3 days to realize something serious cause swelling was not going away.

I can also dry scoop coffee and it don't taste that bad. I can eat food without any spices or salt like boiled veg or chiken without any spices.

1izj7eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1izj7eh/quit_caffeine_sleep_improved_huge_now_worse_again/,Quit caffeine... Sleep improved huge.... Now worse again,"40M. Not on any kind of medication. Poor sleeper for years. Triggered by a stressful event and made worse by what eventually became a full on addiction to coffee which I didn't realize until just recently was a huge part of the problem. Whle my anxiety and stress eventually subsided for the most part, the addiction to coffee(caffeine) remained strong until I began reading just how impactful caffeine can be on a persons sleep. So on December 10th 2024 I cut out ALL caffeine for good. No coffee, no iced tea, not even chocolate. After a week of brutal headaches and withdrawal symptoms something amazing began to happen. For the first time in what must have been 6-7 years I began getting that nice sleepy and droopy eyed feeling before bed. I couldn't keep my eyes open and craved sleep hard. I'd drift off to bed within 15 minutes which is something that NEVER happened while on caffeine. I thought to myself this was it and a real change was happening. Caffeine was messing up my body for years and now my sleep was finally changing for the better and that phase of my life was over. That's what I thought...

Then, I'm not sure what happened. Slowly but surely, after only a couple of weeks max, I began to struggle again. I never tossed and turned again for an hour like I did on caffeine and still don't, but in what I can only describe as a complete mystery, for some reason that sleepy droopy feeling I remember from that first week disappeared and pretty much never returned. The biggest problem however, has been the early awakenings. 90% of days I wake up too early. When I should be sleeping until around 7-730am, I'll instead wake up at 5-530, which will leave me feeling completely shot most of the day. I typically fall asleep around 11. I've tried everything I could at this point. It doesn't matter if I eat somewhat healthy all day and it doesn't matter if I'm scarfing down pizza or a cheeseburger for dinner. My last meal is always at least a few hours before bed and I also don't go too crazy with electronics before bed, though it should be noted that even in that one beautiful week where I was super sleepy before bed, I used my laptop in bed every night before I drifted off. I still don't have any caffeine at all and my anxiety is nothing at all like it was years ago. For the most part, I go to sleep quite relaxed, but I'll admit I still likely have some underlying subtle anxiety, but its no different than any minimal anxiety I've experienced in the last year or so and never ever did I have this constant struggle with early awakenings, even on caffeine. To be clear- the big struggle when on caffeine was mostly related to falling asleep and poor sleep quality. Now that I'm OFF caffeine the problems have become early awakenings.

At this point I know there aren't really any concrete answers. I guess I'm just looking for support... and if someone might have some sort of advice, I'll take it. I look back at that first week post caffeine and just can't understand it. I can't understand how I slept so well and fell asleep so easily. Its not like I had weeks of horrible sleep before that and somehow I built up a weeks worth of sleep pressure. Perhaps it was just a sudden change going on in my body chemistry after getting off the drug of caffeine after many years. In any event, I'm still sleeping poorly most nights. I know that at 40 I am getting a bit older now, but its simply not ok for me to be sleeping this poorly on such a consistent basis. Its also extra heartbreaking knowing that I thought I cracked the code by quitting caffeine only for me to realize I didn't. That said, I still do feel better than I did while on caffeine. Even nights when I don't sleep well, I feel tired, but when on caffeine I felt like I got hit by a bus.",1,1740672234.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

1izj6mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1izj6mn/part_2_of_everything/,Part 2 of Everything,"A week earlier Sarah sat crossed legged on Ellie's bedroom floor, her arms stretched high above her head, back straight in a black leotard and tights.

""Don't hum Sarah"" Ellie rolled her eyes

""You'll be lighting joss sticks next. This is Pilates, not meditation.

Sarah looked up at Ellie, sitting neatly on the middle of her bed in a huge pink towelling robe, her wet hair pulled back behind her ears. Sarah poked out her tongue and began to bend over to the right, humming loudly.

""Feel the stretch down your side?""

""Uh huh.""

""Great, and now the other side, and stop humming.""

Sarah closed her eyes and lent slowly to the left.

""Tight abs, straight back, that's it.""

Ellie tilted her head and pulled a comb through her wet hair. She looked down at Sarah affectionately.

""When are you meeting him?"" She tugged at the knots as she spoke.

""Saturday, for lunch. That new Brasserie thingy place near World's End.""

Sarah opened her eyes and looked at Ellie. Neither of them said anything and neither of them smiled.

""Are you ready for this now?"" Ellie spoke softly, watching her friend carefully. Sarah swallowed.

""Yes, I think so. It makes my heart race just thinking about it...""

Ellie smiled. She knew that feeling very well indeed and was thrilled that her best friend was going to experience the same rush.

""...and I really, really want to buy some new clothes. You completely out-wardrobe me now, I feel soooo frumpy next to you.""

Ellie knew that this was most definitely not true. Sarah had the most beautiful face she had ever seen, and would look fabulous in a bin liner.

""Start off slowly. Draw him in. You need to actually feel his emotions when he gives you money. If you can get on his wavelength he will come back again and again. Look for a chemical reaction between you and feed on that.""

Sarah lowered her hands and placed them on her knees. She moved like a prima ballerina, serenely and full of grace. Ellie adored watching her, and just knew how good she was going be at this.

""OK, thanks hon. How many have you done?""

Ellie looked hurt.

""That is a bit harsh girlfriend. All of them loved gifting me. They just couldn't help themselves, and you can see why, can't you darling?""

Ellie flung her head back theatrically pulling her robe down over each shoulder and shook from side to side, like a burlesque stripper. Sarah laughed out loud.

""Well, that is as maybe, but you took a lot of money from them, didn't you?""

""All in good time honey. All in good time. It will spoil the thrill if you start comparing your conquests with mine. Let me guide you through this first one, and then I will lift the veil a little higher. Fair?""

Sarah pushed her bottom lip out sulkily and started to hum again. Ellie threw a pillow at her head playfully and switched on her hairdryer.

Sarah was hungry after her meeting with Simon, and decided to stop for a coffee on her way back to her flat. She sipped a small latte, leaving a red mark on the rim and called Ellie. A plump pasty young man with a ponytail hunched over a laptop looked up at her and smiled briefly as she tore open a sachet of brown sugar and sprinkled it over the froth. She looked back at him and blinked slowly.

""Oh my god, you rang. I have been pacing the room like a caged thingy.""

""Tiger?""

""Yes, tiger, like a caged tiger. Now tell me what happened?""

Ellie jumped up and down in her kitchen looking out of the window as the breeze rustled through the plane trees""

""Well, I ignored his hand shake, flirted with the waiter, ordered lobster and champagne for both of us, he handed over an envelope with £2000 in £20 notes in it and I left before the food came. I wasn't there more than 5 minutes.""

Ellie smiled, running the top of her stockinged left foot up and down her right calf and ankle and felt a tingling sensation in her tummy. Her voice dropped a tone.

""Did you tell him what I told you?""

""You mean the bit about having my attention only if he pleased me?""

""Yes, yes, did you?""

""Let me think...urm, yes I did.""

Ellie sat on a high kitchen stool and crossed her legs, picking at a loose thread on her skirt absentmindedly.""

""Good girl. Now leave it a few days. Wait for him to make the next move. You need to show complete disinterest, understand?""

Sarah stirred her coffee slowly and then licked the sweet froth from both sides of the spoon. The man opposite looked up again. Sarah looked back at him, totally without expression, and spoke into her phone.

""I understand completely Ellie. Completely.""

The man blushed and looked down quickly at his laptop. Totally outstared he would not look up again. Sarah smiled to herself. She was beginning to enjoy her newly discovered power, but had no idea, simply no idea how mind-bendingly brilliant she was going to be at this.

Nvidia and Salesforce's Earnings Twist Entangles Investors,"AI just blinked, and the whole world squinted, unsure which direction it was headed. This week, tech giants Nvidia and Salesforce found themselves under an unsympathetic spotlight as they released earnings reports that left investors squirming. For those of us in the AI sphere, this might just feel like déjà vu—but this time, more like a Quentin Tarantino plot twist than an elegant Apple keynote.

**Nvidia’s Mixed Signals**

Chip behemoth Nvidia, usually the undisputed heavyweight champion of AI hype, delivered a knockout—a tickler of excitement but falling short of their usual showstopper performance. With a modest stock rise of 1.5%, it’s clear Nvidia’s glow isn’t dimming yet, but there’s doubt about how long it will reign supreme in AI’s erratic playbook.

**Salesforce’s Sky-High Goals?**

Meanwhile, over at Salesforce, their all-in bet on AI agents didn’t yield the jackpot forecasts hoped for; instead, it was more of a meager cup of office coffee. Their ""Agentforce"" AI, envisioned to upend the customer service landscape, now seems more like a courteous helper than an industry savior—resulting in a stock dip of 3.1%. Is Salesforce trying to bite off more than it can ""Code and Complete""?

**Reality Check: AI Enthusiasm vs. Economic Anxiety**

In the backdrop of these earnings dramas lies a pertinent question about AI’s potential. Investors, still hungry for AI’s runaway success semblant in 2023 and 2024, are now managing expectations—while simultaneously keeping an eye on President Trump’s sporadic tariff exposés that loom over the tech industry like an ominous storm cloud.

*Are we approaching a philosophical core of AI fatigue, or is this simply a short pause on an otherwise endless autobahn of innovation?* More to the point: is the hype around AI finally catching up with reality—or are we about to witness the next big surge? Only time will tell if Nvidia and Salesforce will jitterbug into the annals of AI history or shuffle offstage.

1izj4ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1izj4ql/how_i_got_my_energy_back_after_years_of_chronic/,How I Got My Energy Back After Years of Chronic Fatigue,"This is just my story—the result of years of struggling with chronic fatigue, brain fog, gut issues, and feeling like my body was completely shutting down on me. I spent so much time trying to figure out what was wrong, and even longer trying to fix it.

It all started in 2020 when I suddenly developed a gluten intolerance. One day, I could eat anything, and the next, even the smallest trace of gluten would put me on the couch, sick for two days. At first, I had no idea what was happening—I was constantly feeling sick for no reason. But even after cutting out gluten completely, I was still getting sick randomly. I chalked it up to bad luck, figured I was just someone who randomly got sick more often, and moved on.

Then, two years ago, it got worse. The fatigue hit like a brick wall. My muscles felt weak, my body was inflamed, I was constantly dizzy, and I had zero energy. I felt completely isolated because I physically **couldn’t** do anything. No motivation, no drive—just this heavy exhaustion that never went away. I could barely get out of bed. I felt sick all day, every day. My brain fog was so bad I couldn’t focus on anything.

A year later, still sick, I became convinced I had mold toxicity. I went all in on detoxing, taking every supplement imaginable, hoping the next one would be the magic fix. I was dumping money into different protocols, but nothing changed. My doctor didn’t take it seriously, brushing it off like it was just something that would pass. But it never did.

Then one night, I watched a documentary about a guy with a chronic illness who decided to drink only juice for 60 days to heal himself. At one point, he’s talking to a group of people in a diner, asking if they would ever juice full-time. Most of them said no, but one guy really stood out. He was overweight, eating pie, and talking about his severe diabetes. He said he knew it was killing him, but he just couldn’t stop eating sugar.

That moment hit me in a way I didn’t expect. He was literally saying he had **no control** over his own hands—because in order to eat that pie, he had to pick up the fork. That was when something clicked for me.

I had been using alcohol to cope for years. Even though I wasn’t eating gluten, my diet was still full of processed foods, and I relied on drinking to “take the edge off.” I had tried to quit before, but I always went back. But that night, I realized if I was saying **I can’t quit**, what I was really saying was **I have no control over my own hand**. Because in order to drink, I had to **choose** to pick up the bottle. And in order to eat that food, i had to physically pick it up and put it in my mouth.

So I took control of my hand. I quit drinking and eating processed foods that night and never looked back.

I also started juicing after watching that documentary, and that’s when I really saw how addicted I was to processed food and sugar. I went **90 days drinking only juice**, and for the first three weeks, I felt **unstoppable**. My energy was through the roof. My brain was crystal clear. My body felt like it was **finally healing**.

And then—boom. I crashed.

Out of nowhere, I started feeling sick again. I couldn’t believe it. I thought I had cured myself. But at the time, I still believed I had mold toxicity, so I **kept pushing my body with detox supplements**. Looking back, I now realize what happened.

When I quit alcohol and processed food, my body finally felt safe enough to relax. It had been running on **pure survival mode for years**, and for those three weeks, it finally got to rest. But then I **kicked it right back into stress mode** with supplements that were forcing my body to detox when it didn’t need to.

But I didn’t know that yet, so I kept chasing the next magic cure. More supplements. More detoxing. More stress on my body. **None of it worked.** The only thing I actually felt a difference from was **magnesium**.

Then one day, I stumbled upon **Wim Hof**. If you don’t know who he is, he’s famous for extreme cold exposure and breathwork techniques. I started doing his **breathing exercises**, and for the first time in years, I actually felt **better**. That led me to research **why**, and I discovered the **vagus nerve**—the key to getting your body out of fight-or-flight mode.

I started doing **ice baths**, and suddenly, **I wasn’t tired anymore**. My brain fog lifted. My energy came back. And that was when I finally understood what was actually wrong with me.

# My Nervous System Had Been Stuck in Survival Mode

When you go through prolonged stress or trauma, your body can get **stuck in fight-or-flight mode**. Instead of returning to a relaxed state, it stays **on high alert**, constantly pumping out stress hormones. It doesn’t matter whether the stress comes from war, an abusive household, financial ruin, or years of nonstop anxiety—your body reacts **the same way**.

For me, that stress started in **2019**, when my health issues began. I had a greenhouse business and sold nearly half a million dollars worth of product. Then, my supplier tried to screw me over. I had furious customers calling me constantly, cussing me out, threatening me. I barely slept for **months**. My body **never** had a chance to recover. To my body, it was **life or death**. I never did anything to pull myself out of it, so my **default state** became fight-or-flight.

Once I realized this, I **stopped chasing supplements** and started focusing on **getting my nervous system back to normal**. I cut back on **almost everything**—except magnesium, which I still take every day. I focused on:

* **Stimulating my vagus nerve daily** through breathwork, ice baths, humming, and cold showers.
* **Getting out of fight-or-flight mode** by meditating, spending time outside, and staying off stress-inducing social media.
* **Staying present** by reading *The Power of Now* by Eckhart Tolle, because past trauma and future anxiety keep your body in survival mode.
* **Eating real food**—whole foods only, no processed garbage, no sugar, no seed oils.
* **Swapping coffee for ceremonial-grade matcha**—it gives a more stable energy boost, doesn’t crash your system, and actually **helps** your nervous system instead of stressing it out.

Now? I have **more energy than I’ve had since I was a kid**. My brain is **clear**, and I feel like I actually **got my life back**.

I’m sharing this because I know what it feels like to be **stuck**, hopeless, and desperate for answers. Get your body out of fight-or-flight. Eat real food. Slow down. You might be **shocked** at what happens.

I know some people will disagree with parts of this, and that’s fine. This is just **my story**. But if even one person out there finds something useful in it, then it was worth sharing.",1,1740672060.0,ChronicIllness,2,1.0,False

1. If you know you’re close to levelling up and you haven’t claimed the daily quests, wait until energy is depleted to claim coz it’ll fill it completely after levelling
2. For in-game quests, always try to complete them even if you don’t get enough latte orders for steamed milk quests. Great for practice and the extra XP
3. You don’t need to do latte art (but it is very enjoyable and I always gotta add a heart)
4. Check “Equipment” tabs for repairs if you notice they’re slowing down or you’re not as accurate with coffee grinding
5. Each equipment comes with unique perks such as higher tips for latte so don’t upgrade the basic fully if you wish to change later and save money (I made that mistake 😭)
6. Always add 2 scoops of ice if asked specifically for iced (but NOT cold)
7. Always add milk/water last to drinks (I find the measurement upgrade to not be accurate enough)
8. Remember hot = mugs, cold = glass
9. You can check recipes on the MyPad but it currently does not pause time. You can access it in the main menu after each game day tho.
10. Don’t be afraid to ask what as orders are repeated and if you learn it once, you don’t need to worry anymore if you see it again
11. For expected tips, I get $2.00 for a perfect espresso, and $3.40 for a perfect latte

I am very lucky I haven’t discovered any major bugs so far outside of logging in. My main criticism is the energy system as it takes forever to replenish, reminds me of the garlic from GPGP but worse. I have noticed the days seem to get longer the more days I play and an increase in customers too (I do have both longer days and mascot upgrades which I highly recommend getting early).

Good luck brewists and I hope this post helps! And thank you to the beta testers for spotting bugs early and the kind souls that showed how to steam the milk properly 😊 And TapBlaze for creating another amazing game which I’m positive will improve with time like GPGP",2,1740672026.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,0,1.0,False
1izj45t,https://i.redd.it/sx39lw5mfple1.jpeg,Dieffenbachia Troubles,"I bought this dieffenbachia maybe 9 months ago. I think I left it outside by accident once in the summer and the leaves crisped a little, but we’re not wilting like this until recently. I did have it in a darker corner of the house for a while and it started dying like this, so I brought it into our office (pictured here) where it can get more indirect sunlight. I’m a person who is tends to let my soil dry out pretty well before watering, but in an effort to treat this plant I started giving her water a little more frequently (once a week or until her soil isn’t damp anymore). I also added a tablespoon or two of coffee grounds to acidify the soil a little. No pests appear to be present and it even looks as though there’s new growth coming through.

Tools you can trust, Brave & DuckDuckGo (reccomend)  Remember the key word ""Why"". A question: how do you find the source of the Problem? You find the ""Root"" the ""Why"". Then find the ""How"", how did the problem occur? Write that down make note of why and how. 


An Example: Octan in the Lego Movie they owned Voting Machines, History Books, Coffee, Businesses, they owned surveillance systems etc. A Parent Company can own many companies so follow the money. 

Another example 

Detectives. What do they do? They collect evidence ask what happened. They are tasked with finding the Why and the How and the Who. Why did this take place, how did it take place and who was behind it. Detectives research to find the who. Then they get their guy. 

Follow up Question: If you do not do your research does that make you susceptible to manipulation? Ask yourself this question. | Some Methods to find who owns who: Look up on Brave for example Parent company of T-Mobile. Then look up Parent company of that company then keep going till you find who owns these companies. 

 You can also use Open Secrets they are a fantastic resource. If you struggle to find who the Parent Company is look at terms and conditions. | This is how you Research to find the Root. | How does one research to find History? Well what does a Journalist do a good one that is? He asks the opposing side their take. Why do Journalists do this or supposed to? To give each side a voice similar to a court room you have a prosecuter and an attorney. 

 look at the history of the opposing sides then relate it to the history you were taught. Do you see anything that is off? Look for hard evidence like photographs, documents, confessions. Then you hear the whole story 

Yes this is something we learned young is to listen to both sides of arguments to get the full story. If we dont its an echo chamber and you miss out on possible information you didnt consider or know about. This is Critical Lesson. ",1,1740672017.0,wisdom,0,1.0,False
1izj3wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1izj3wc/i_did_a_stupid_think_and_fck_am_i_paying_for_it/,I did a stupid think and f*ck am I paying for it,"Tomorrow I'm moving two hours away from where I currently live and almost everything is packed up. On normal days, I drink Earl grey tea every single morning with some 2% milk, at least 3 glasses on an empty stomach, sometimes as many as 5 (14oz with milk) cups before eating if I miss breakfast. Last night, I packed up my normal tea and decided to have some old raspberry flavored black tea that I'm not a huge fan of just to go through it so I don't have to move it. 

This morning I woke up, boiled a pot of water, added the tea leaves to my brewer thing, poured the water on (I always use boiling water on my Earl grey), let it brew for only a few minutes cuz I was eager to start drinking, poured the tea into my cup, added milk as usual, took a sip and almost spat it right back out. 

I had accidentally made green tea instead of black. I didn't realize it in my exhausted state, but I'd left the wrong tea behind. I shrugged my shoulders and tried to drink the bitter tea. After only about a quarter of the cup gone, I started to get ridiculously sick to my stomach. I had one more sip and I'm so nauseous that I can barely move. 

Why does green tea do this to me???? There is nothing different in the way I made it than black tea. A lot of people say black tea hurts their stomach and it must be the tannins but I literally can have 5 cups of black tea for breakfast and be fine. It's not having tea on an empty stomach that's bothering me, it's the green tea specifically.

Can anyone explain to me the science behind why green tea hurts my stomach but black tea (and coffee) doesn't? It's not the milk I added, cuz I added the normal amount this morning thinking I had black tea. What is it about green tea that just f*cking slays my intestines?",1,1740672008.0,tea,3,0.6,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I have been trying to increase my longer runs and just made it to 8 miles (at approx 12.5 min miles). My problem is I ALWAYS seem to need to pee about 4 miles in. I like to run in the morning, when I have the most energy, but it also means I just had coffee.  I have been trying to limit my 'before run' coffee to just 1 cup. I also am a very heavy sweat-er, which means I have to consume some water or I feel myself dehydrating and start feeling miserable.  I have been having to adjust my route so I can run back by my house halfway through the run, run in to pee, then continue on my way.  Are other people dealing with this? Is there tips to reduce the need, or is it just my body and I should just get used to accommodating it?

Not sure if it’s related or something else.","I’ve only done Wave I twice so far, so I don’t know whether or not this was something I experienced because of the tapes or something else. 

I laid down a little while ago to take a quick coffee nap (less than 30 min nap right after drinking coffee). I haven’t listened to the tapes in a couple of days, but as I started dozing off, I did a quick jump/twitch like I normally do, then something slightly strange happened right after. I was kind of half sleep/awake and my body started vibrating. It was slight at first, but gradually got stronger. While my eyes were closed, everything was black of course, but then I started seeing these swirls (idk if that’s really the correct term) of just blue at first, then blue and purple colors together coming in. They were sort of rolling in like storm clouds and then were, like, swirling around. Not fast like a whirlwind, but not slowly either. This lasted like a minute or two and then everything stopped and I woke up. I feel like it could possibly just be the effect of the caffeine and I was vibrating bc it’s stimulating, but I’ve taken coffee naps before and nothing like this has ever happened. 

I know people have experienced the vibrations, but has anyone else seen colors and had something like this happen when they first started the tapes? If so, what was this supposed to be? What do the colors represent? 

I feel like it’s too soon to really be feeling anything significant now, especially since I was just taking a random nap with no tapes, but maybe I’m wrong?

Well my recruiter is already asking about future contracts and needing for me to update my profile and get a reference from my current facility. Like what? I already have 3 solid refs on my profile from my previous staff job. 

Well I haven't exactly made friends with anyone here. I'm nice and all and get along well with both day & night folks. I chat and laugh with the people on my unit but I also kinda keep to myself. Like it's not like I'm close to where we go out for coffee dates or talk personal life. On top of that I've called out a few times for good reasons. Never got any warnings or anything but what if they out I called out ""too much"".

I just feel weird asking for a reference from someone I barely know, probably needs to be a charge nurse too.Maybe I'm overthinking. 

But is this to be expected to get a new reference when finishing up every assignment? I'm caught off guard and a little annoyed by this. ",2,1740671843.0,TravelNursing,2,1.0,False
1izj0um,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1izj0um/four_options_confused_on_which_path_to_take/,Four options. Confused on which path to take.,"I am in need of some advice.  I know this is a long post.  At the very least, I hope you find it entertaining.  Here is my story...


The Ex:

About a year ago, I got out of a five year long relationship with the person I thought I was going to marry.  I loved her very much, but she got a new job in sales working 50 hours per week and when she would come home, she would just eat and go to sleep.  On weekends, she would spend time getting ahead of her workload for the week and didn't have time for cuddling, fun activities, or any kind of quality time.  She was not spending time with friends either, but just working and sleeping.  

For the last year of our relationship, the sex became very infrequent.  We'd do it once month at most.  When we did have sex, the passion had gone and it seemed like it was a chore for her.  I talked to her about it and she said I was great in bed, but she was too tired to be into it from working all the time.  I had multiple discussions about my unhappiness since she started the new job, as my needs in the relationship were no longer being met.  Though I suggested many solutions, she refused to make any compromise and we decided to part ways.  I was heartbroken.  I loved this woman, but we slowly drifted apart.  How could I be in a relationship with someone I barely spent time with?


The Colleague:

Now, one year after the breakup, my friends suggested I start dating again.  I work in public relations for a really good company.  At my job, there was this woman who always thought I was great and wanted to go out with me, but I didn't do it because I wasn't over my ex yet and I thought it would be strange to date a colleague.  She was persistent.

Finally, I agreed.  We went on three super amazing dates.  Our understanding of each other bordered on telepathy.  We had a crazy strong connection and she was gorgeous.  She then sent me over 100 rapid fire texts throughout the week, some of which were very flirtatious and sexual.  I didn't mind, as I really liked her, but I thought it maybe was a red flag.  I'd reply as often as I could, but out of nowhere, the messages stopped.  When I tried contacting her, I received no reply.  It was all very sudden.  She went from full-on obsession to ghost mode.  A week later, she told me she doesn't feel comfortable being in a relationship and would rather be friends.  I was confused, but respected her wishes and agreed to just be friends.  Unfortunately, I still think she is awesome, but I suspect she has a disorganized attachment style, which is very difficult to handle.  If not for that, I'd still be trying for a real relationship with her.  For a minute, it felt almost too perfect.  Very twin-flame.  She still flirts with me occasionally at work, but we always go our separate ways.


The Brain:

A few weeks after, I began dating a lovely woman I met in a coffee shop.  She works for another company in IT.  She is fun, nerdy, and intelligent.  We share stories of world history, science, and comic books (I'm into these things as well).  We've been together for four months now, seeing each other about three times per week.  

We had an awesome Valentine's Day.  I took her to the symphony and we went for a romantic dinner at an aquarium in an underwater tunnel.  The tropical fish swam around us while we dined and had great conversations.  There is one problem.  She just recently told me she is very religious and doesn't want to have sex until marriage.  Keep in mind that I'm 38yrs old and she is 33yrs.  At this point in my life, I want a healthy sex life.  We talked about it, but I don't think she will change her mind.  I have to respect that.  We are still dating, but here is where things get really interesting...


The Wild Card:

Out of nowhere, my original ex that works 50 hours a week calls me and tells me she wants me back!  She says she still loves me and misses me.  I told her I'm dating someone else and I don't cheat, so that won't be happening while I'm in another relationship.  Furthermore, she got promoted and now works even more.  I don't see it working out when she still won't have time to spend with me.  It still hurts my heart because part of me still loves her.


TL;DR:  I need some advice.  Here are my options as far as I can see it:

Option 1:  Stay with The Brain and enjoy her time and personality, but have no sex life.  She is otherwise fantastic, but I'll probably get sexually frustrated.

Option 2:  Go back to The Ex and have an intermittent sex life, but hardly get to spend time with her.  I'll probably still have a tough time with her workaholic lifestyle.

Option 3:  Pursue a relationship with The Colleague, probably have a great sex life, enjoy the twin-flame, but risk that it could go really bad since she has a disorganized attachment style and I have to work with her.

Option 4:  Return to the dating pool and keep searching for love.

Please help me decide!

Last year I was able to eat fairly freely and wasn't on any meds. I wasn't ""normal"", but much better. I have no idea what triggered this. I consulted a hEDS/POTS/MCAS doctor, but she's super expensive so I'm trying to figure out what to ask her next. She put me on H1 (Cetirizin, but I'm taking desloratadin which I'd taken before), H2 (Pepcid), Montelukast (essentially Singulair), an anti-inflammatory that I can't take and nortriptyline, which I also won't take due to POTS. Also, does anyone know what the point of nortriptyline is?

It seems that the ones I'm taking aren't enough. I get the adrenaline dump type of symptoms with diarrhea, tachycardia, shakes, weakness etc. It's always scary, because I'm not a 100% sure if it's MCAS or POTS.

I've been on a relatively low-histamine diet (i.e. chicken, rice, bell pepper, milk, decaf coffee). I also eat 100% rye bread. The diet is a really hard one for me and I haven't been able to figure out any triggers.

Anyways, I've read about Cromolyn, Ketotifen, possibility of SIBO, gastroparesis and so forth. I wonder if there's something else I should add to the list of questions to my doctor? I can't afford a third consultation so I'm trying to gather up all the information I can. I'd really appreciate your help! This sucks so bad.",2,1740671725.0,MCAS,1,1.0,False

Tools you can trust, Brave & DuckDuckGo (reccomend)  Remember the key word ""Why"". A question: how do you find the source of the Problem? You find the ""Root"" the ""Why"". Then find the ""How"", how did the problem occur? Write that down make note of why and how. 


An Example: Octan in the Lego Movie they owned Voting Machines, History Books, Coffee, Businesses, they owned surveillance systems etc. A Parent Company can own many companies so follow the money. 

Another example 

Detectives. What do they do? They collect evidence ask what happened. They are tasked with finding the Why and the How and the Who. Why did this take place, how did it take place and who was behind it. Detectives research to find the who. Then they get their guy. 

Follow up Question: If you do not do your research does that make you susceptible to manipulation? Ask yourself this question. | Some Methods to find who owns who: Look up on Brave for example Parent company of T-Mobile. Then look up Parent company of that company then keep going till you find who owns these companies. 

 You can also use Open Secrets they are a fantastic resource. If you struggle to find who the Parent Company is look at terms and conditions. | This is how you Research to find the Root. | How does one research to find History? Well what does a Journalist do a good one that is? He asks the opposing side their take. Why do Journalists do this or supposed to? To give each side a voice similar to a court room you have a prosecuter and an attorney. 

 look at the history of the opposing sides then relate it to the history you were taught. Do you see anything that is off? Look for hard evidence like photographs, documents, confessions. Then you hear the whole story 

Yes this is something we learned young is to listen to both sides of arguments to get the full story. If we dont its an echo chamber and you miss out on possible information you didnt consider or know about. This is Critical Lesson. ",1,1740671674.0,research,1,1.0,False

1iziumw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1iziumw/how_to_remove_mildew_smell_from_water_bottle/,How to Remove Mildew Smell from Water Bottle Gaskets,"Hi all! I've had this problem for years and I've never been able to find a solid solution. I am wondering if anyone has a good method for getting rid of that moldy/mildewy smell that lingers on rubber gaskets and o-rings in water bottles.

I've specifically had this issue with coffee in my bottles/mugs. I will be sure to dump my coffee if there is extra, clean my bottle/mug as soon as I'm done, and remove and wash the gaskets each time, but regardless, sooner or later the gasket reeks of mildew and it is all I can smell when I go to take a sip. I will soak them in a strong bleach solution, scrub with Dawn, and repeat endlessly with no reduction in smell. 

It is to the point where I received a Yeti mug *last* Christmas that I refuse to use for coffee because I don't want it to smell. I know that buying replacements is always an option, but this has happened to literally every water bottle I've owned that is used for non-water liquid, no matter how frequently and quickly I clean. I'd rather figure out how to clean this then buy replacements every other month for all of my bottles.

Thank you all in advance, I truly appreciate any and all tips!",1,1740671364.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False

1iziqes,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1iziqes/how_the_fuck_does_one_become_friends_with_their/,How the fuck does one become friends with their ex - stalkers/ harasser ? Help me figure this out.,"Backstory - I (A - 26F) Met this girl (B - 26F) in my school at class 9, became friends. She's a sincere, hardworking, studious girl. She had joined the school before me. Found out from other friends that she had been badly harassed the previous year by this boy (C - 26M). Felt bad for her ofcourse. Thought that was the reason she became so reclusive. This guy apparently stalked her (on her way back to her home), harassed her (by giving unwarranted attention etc). I noticed the creepy behaviour , but it toned down by then apparently. She seemed repulsed by him and actively avoided him.

Then this guy started giving me the creepy stares the next year (class 10). I was so uncomfortable that I had to literally run away to empty classrooms/corridors to study during study hours. You know those creepy stares, where you feel like insects and stuff crawling on your skin. It went on for a long time, one day I decided it was enough, gathered courage and looked at him directly and gave a serious look and a sweeping gesture with hand (like to mean, get off me - but I really wish I had given him a middle finger). After that luckily, he didn't bother me much. 

Post school, me and this girl, we were barely in touch, due to college and stuff. But I've always thought of her as a good and sweet friend who deserved the best. 


Cut to now - ran into her suddenly in a coffee shop in a different city. I recognised her and lit up and said hi enthusiastically. She on the other hand looked a bit flustered/(or maybe didn't recognise me) we said hi to each other, I tried to strike up a small conversation, she talked back, but she seemed to be in a hurry and left. But, outside the shop, waiting for her was none other than this guy (C). They left together on a bike. I didn't talk to the guy, ofcourse, I didn't even acknowledge him. (Why should I ? It's not like he ever apologised to me for his creepy behaviour). Maybe she didn't want me to see her with him, that's why she hurried away. I wouldn't know. But it gave me an unsettling feeling. I don't understand why. Cuz if it was me, even if the guy apologised later, even if I accepted, I wouldn't wanna be friends with him.

Girls, under what circumstances would you talk to your ex- stalkers/ harassers let alone be friends with them later ? Please help me understand this situation.

1iziiy1,https://i.redd.it/ut15x8m9bple1.jpeg,"With the Solana bridge active, $Kendu is worth a look with Murad’s thesis in mind","Every time I turn around there’s another rug pull hitting the news, where a Solana-based token dumped on the crypto community who were just gambling m, anyway, and has no real conviction beyond a quick buck. This kind of crypto trading, really prominent on Solana, is causing a lot of problems to crypto holders, and it’s time to follow Murad’s thesis. $SPX6900 and $giga and $popcat and others like them on Murad’s list, available on Solana, all have the same problem: they hit their marketcap above a hundred million already, so the life changing gains that can come from projects that reach multi-billion marketcap have already begun for the early holders who continue to hold! I hold a few of these, and support them, but I know it’s already a little late for the kind of gains crypto degens dream about. $kendu is the best chance at life changing gains at a low enough market cap that regular investors can still reach life-changing gains. $kendu was started on Ethereum, but with the wormhole bridge, it is extremely easy to join the best team in defi.

Kendu Inu represents exactly what Murad describes as diamond-handed cult coins. These are not just meme coins, but movements powered by unwavering conviction that outlast any market cycle. The Kendu army has been through the fire, getting dumped on by a bad dev when we were climbing up past 300 million market cap, dumping the dev and becoming a CTO with diamond/handed holders and a highly active telegram. There are so many real world impacts happening and the community has proven itself strong.

The biggest gains on huge projects are not built on quick flips but on communities that refuse to let go, turning early believers into legends.

While much of crypto (and Solana memecoin traders!) is caught in a cycle of short-lived hype and PvP gambling, where everyone scrambles to sell first, Kendu Inu is proving that real success comes from long-term commitment. This is not about chasing the next pump. It is about building something that lasts, backed by a community that understands the real value of patience and momentum.

Kendu is making its presence known in every space. Looby’s live art session brought the project to life with creativity and energy. Don’t know Looby? He’s a lead artist on GTA6: https://x.com/LoobyonSol/status/1894829490200813949. The street art team is turning city walls into statements that demand attention at major art events worldwide, recently in Miami. Beyond art, Kendu is breaking into the real world with energy drinks and coffee and jewelry and huge nightclub events in India, proving that this movement is more than just another cryptocurrency.

Murad’s thesis is unfolding in real time. The biggest wins in crypto come not from short-term speculation, but from those who hold strong until the world has no choice but to recognize what they have built. Kendu Inu is showing exactly how that happens. It is also showing this happening not just by bull posting on social media, but by bridging the gaps between different chains, and bridging the digital world and the real world.

1izihpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1izihpg/is_philips_ep444490_the_best_espresso_machine/,Is Philips EP4444/90 the best espresso machine? Read this review to decide!,"Owning the Philips EP4444/90 espresso machine has transformed my mornings into a genuine café experience. I've been using it daily for months, and while it has its highlights, there are some quirks worth noting. Here’s my honest take on this fully automatic coffee machine.

**Design & Build Quality**

The moment I unboxed this machine, its Black Chrome finish immediately stood out. It’s modern, sleek, and surprisingly compact for an appliance of its kind. Its dimensions (9.68"" x 17.04"" x 14.6"") conveniently fit under my kitchen cabinets, which was a relief since counter space is always at a premium in my home. Despite its relatively light weight of 17.63 pounds, the machine feels sturdy. However, one frustrating design flaw is the top lid for the bean hopper. Instead of being attached, it’s completely removable, which means I often find myself searching for where I placed it after refilling beans. Small gripe, but still.

**Brewing Performance**

The brewing process is impressively streamlined. With a few button presses, you can go from beans to a piping hot cup of coffee in under a minute. However, I noticed that the brewing time for espressos is shorter than I’d like, which sometimes impacts the richness of the coffee. Adjusting the grind size and strength settings helped a bit, but it’s something to keep in mind if you’re particular about your brew.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

The LatteGo milk system is a game-changer. Frothing milk for cappuccinos and lattes is effortless, even with plant-based options. The froth comes out silky and smooth, although not quite as velvety as a professional barista’s. One thing I absolutely love is the ease of cleaning. The milk system has only two parts and can be rinsed in about 10 seconds. I’ve even tossed it in the dishwasher a couple of times without issue. My only complaint? The machine always pours the milk first, which isn’t ideal for layering drinks like cappuccinos properly.

**Coffee Quality**

Thanks to the 100% ceramic grinders, the flavor of the coffee is rich and consistent. The adjustable grinder settings (12 in total) allow for customization, and I’ve experimented with everything from coarse to fine. The aroma seal on the bean hopper ensures freshness, even if you don’t use the machine every day. My favorite drink to make is an Americano with a touch of frothed milk. However, my husband finds the espresso shots slightly lacking in depth compared to pricier machines like Jura.

**Features**

This machine boasts an impressive variety of 12 drink options. From espressos to iced coffees, it’s a one-stop shop for coffee lovers. The digital display is intuitive and user-friendly, even for my tech-averse mother-in-law. Another standout feature is the AquaClean filter, which promises up to 5,000 cups without descaling. I haven’t reached that number yet, but the water tastes clean, and the machine’s maintenance reminders are helpful.

[Time to see Philips EP4444/90 cost on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0czgq5kh7/)

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The 1.8L water tank is adequate for daily use in my household, even when entertaining guests. Filling it is straightforward, and I appreciate how it slides out for easy access. However, I’ve noticed the machine occasionally displays an “Add Water” message even when the tank is full. It’s a minor annoyance, but it interrupts the brewing process.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

Philips’ SilentBrew Technology is a blessing. Compared to my old espresso machine, which sounded like a jet engine, this one is noticeably quieter. It’s not silent, but it’s quiet enough that I can brew coffee early in the morning without waking the entire house. The energy efficiency is another plus; it powers down automatically after a period of inactivity, which eases my eco-guilt.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

Cleaning this machine is a breeze. The brew group is removable, which is a huge plus for thorough cleaning. The drip tray and grounds container slide out effortlessly for quick rinsing. I run the guided descaling program every few months to keep everything in tip-top shape. The machine also self-cleans after each use, which is both a blessing and a curse since it fills the drip tray quickly.

**Warranty & Support**

Philips offers a two-year warranty, which provides peace of mind. I did have to contact customer support once about the “Add Water” issue, and while they were friendly, the troubleshooting steps didn’t fully resolve the problem. Still, I appreciate their willingness to assist.

**Advantages**

* LatteGo milk system is incredibly easy to clean.
* Offers 12 customizable drink options.
* Compact design fits under kitchen cabinets.
* SilentBrew Technology keeps noise levels low.

**Limitations**

* Milk is poured first, which isn’t ideal for certain drinks.
* Occasional “Add Water” error when the tank is full.
* Espresso brew time feels too short for a full-bodied flavor.

**Competitive Options**

Comparing the Philips EP4444/90 to competitors like Jura, the main trade-off is price versus performance. Jura machines deliver better espresso quality and more advanced customization options, but they come at a significantly higher cost. On the other hand, De’Longhi offers similar features for a slightly lower price, though their milk systems aren’t as user-friendly as Philips’ LatteGo. If you value ease of use and cleaning above all else, this machine is hard to beat.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering its features and performance, the Philips EP4444/90 offers excellent value for money. While it’s not the cheapest espresso machine on the market, its versatility and ease of maintenance justify the investment for coffee enthusiasts who want café-quality beverages at home.

I can't say we've truly hit it off since then, but throughout the year we interacted a lot and I noticed that I really like her as a person - not only as a 'fandom buddy' who I can talk to when I need to share my thoughts on the game (which I'm no longer as passionate about as before, but she still is), but as an actual human being I would love to be close to. I like the way she thinks, and I think she carries herself pretty well in the adult world, even though she probably wouldn't agree with me. She feels mature, like you can actually discuss anything with her and be understood, which honestly doesn't happen much with other people my age. Hell, we've even met in real life and even though we couldn't spend time together properly, us sitting down for coffee while she showed me things she bought from a festival she visited in my city (we both live in big cities four hours apart, but the commute's pretty pricy, which doesn't allow me to just visit her city without a proper reason) was more than enough to make me like her even more. I'd love to actually be friends with her, but... I don't really know if being friends with me would interest her, and that's why I'm not pushing past us being simply acquaintances.   
  
Because next to her, I honestly sometimes feel like a dumb child who wanders life blindly while everybody else's got it all figured out, and I don't think she would need that kind of person in her life. 

She's got a degree, a somewhat draining day job, a flat she either has or rents in her city (obviously, I never asked) and a cat she cares about. I'm almost on my last year of university, but I hate my major and I am in a pretty difficult position where changing it isn't really an option, and all my expenses are covered by my parents. I also have problems with my mental health caused by rough upbringing, and even though she probably wouldn't mind, I feel like all of this combined makes me feel really immature. I also probably have ADHD (sadly, I'm unable to get properly diagnosed because my country still doesn't think ADHD in adults is a real thing) which doesn't help at all. I have hobbies, but none of them are at a level where I would be considered extremely good, so, uh, I'm pretty unremarkable all things considered. In conversations, I'm mostly a listener and sometimes have trouble speaking my mind. I didn't think that her being a bit older than me would be much of an issue, and most of the time when we talk about our interests it really isn't, but then I hear her talking about her job or just life in general and I think 'wow, how can she be interested in a friend who isn't as stable?'. She also knows a lot of things that I probably should've realized way earlier, like, for example, she knows how to dress, she navigates conversations better than me and she understands a lot of basic concepts way better than I do (not in a philosophical kinda way, but in a 'knows how to act in a variety of social situations' kinda way). I fear that if I pursue a friendship with her, it will one day feel like a... mentorship of sorts? I've made friends with a lot of immature people at some point in my life, and I know how tiring it is to be the so-called 'mom friend'. I know I wouldn't do that to her, but what if I make her feel like that by accident? Yeah, I can't possibly know everything, sometimes getting friendly advice is nice and all, but I don't want that to grow into a full-blown teacher-student situation.   
  
I guess what I really fear is that she's only being nice to me right now, but if I tell her I want to talk more outside of our usual topics, she'll reject me because even though I can theoretically say 'yeah, don't worry, I know what I'm going to do after uni, I'm not really looking for a babysitter/therapist', I can't really prove it. Everything about me is not a good look, from my life to my appearance. I've also had bad experiences in middle school when I could've talked to people a bit older than me about literally anything in the world and they would say they really liked talking to me, but once I've told them my actual age, it was over. I was suddenly treated as if I were an infant and I've lost a lot of possible friendships because of that. She knows my age and that didn't stop her from talking to me, and she doesn't seem like a person to care about that kind of stuff, but still. She already has close friends she talks to on a regular basis who are more like her than me, and I don't know if letting me into her friend group would be a good idea.  
  
I'm afraid of being perceived as a burden. I know that if that were the case, the right thing would be to simply end the friendship altogether, but I want to know - are there, perhaps, any ways to, uh, show a person you're responsible and composed without saying it directly? Or, better yet, to do just that and also conquer that fear? Because I feel like I'm missing out on so many opportunities to make new friends just because I believe I'm not 'mature' enough to talk to all these interesting people.

1izig2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1izig2e/could_the_waterdrop_wdwhf21pg_whole_house_water/,Could the Waterdrop WD-WHF21-PG whole house water filter system be your next upgrade? A detailed review,"**Ease of Installation & Use**

Setting up the Waterdrop WD-WHF21-PG whole house water filter system turned out to be a mix of simplicity and a slight challenge. Following the manual, I managed to install it myself without needing professional help, which is always a plus for a DIY enthusiast like me. The included wrench was helpful during the setup, though wrapping Teflon tape on the fittings proved to be a delicate balance—too much tape caused alignment issues, and too little led to leaks. After a couple of adjustments and ensuring I used polypropylene fittings rather than metal ones, the system was leak-free and operational. While the process took longer than expected, I appreciated the satisfaction of completing it on my own.

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**

This system boasts a five-stage filtration process, which includes a 10” x 4.5” PP filter and a GAC filter made from natural coconut shell. The claim of reducing particles larger than 5 microns, chlorine, lead, and other impurities held up well in my daily use. The water tasted noticeably cleaner, and there was an improvement in odor. Even my family commented on the difference, especially when cooking pasta or making coffee. However, I noticed that if you have extremely high iron content, as one reviewer mentioned, you might need to consider upgrading to higher-quality filters for optimal performance.

**Flow Rate & Performance**

The flow rate of this system was steady and consistent. After running several tests, even during high-demand times like mornings with multiple showers running, the water pressure didn’t falter. This was a big relief, as I’ve dealt with filters in the past that severely impacted water pressure. The system is robust, having passed over 100,000 water hammer tests, which gave me confidence in its durability and reliability.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**

Maintenance is fairly straightforward. The GAC filter needs replacing every six months, while the PP filter lasts about 3-6 months, depending on usage. I found the replacement process simple, thanks to the included wrench. However, the costs could add up over time, especially for larger households with higher water consumption. Monitoring water quality to determine the ideal replacement interval is key. For my family of four, replacement at the recommended intervals seemed reasonable.

**Certifications**

Though the product page doesn’t list any specific third-party certifications, the system is constructed from food-grade materials and tested to withstand pressures up to 90 psi. This reassured me about its safety and durability. However, I would have liked to see certifications like NSF or WQA to further validate its filtration claims.

**Capacity & Suitability**

Designed for whole-house filtration, this system effectively handled the daily water needs of my household. Whether we were using water for showers, laundry, or cooking, the system delivered clean water seamlessly. Its compact size (14.37 x 7.48 x 15.55 inches) made it easy to install in a utility room without taking up too much space.

**Warranty**

The warranty details weren’t clearly mentioned, so I reached out to the manufacturer for clarification. While I didn’t immediately encounter issues requiring warranty support, knowing the terms would have been helpful. It’s always a good idea to check with customer service for peace of mind before purchasing.

**Advantages**

* The five-stage filtration system ensures cleaner, better-tasting water.
* DIY installation is feasible with the included tools and manual.
* Consistent water pressure even during peak usage times.
* Compact size fits easily into most utility spaces.

**Drawbacks**

* Plastic threads on the fittings can be tricky to work with.
* Regular filter replacements can become costly for larger households.
* Lack of transparent housing makes it hard to visually judge filter condition.

**Competitive Options**

When comparing it to other whole-house water filters, such as the iSpring WGB21B, I found the Waterdrop system to have a sleeker design and a simpler installation process. However, the iSpring model offers clear housings for easier monitoring of filter conditions. Another alternative, the Aquasana EQ-1000, provides a higher capacity but comes at a significantly higher price point. If you’re on a budget and looking for a reliable system, the Waterdrop WD-WHF21-PG strikes a good balance between performance and affordability.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering its features and performance, the Waterdrop system offers decent value for the price. While the initial investment and ongoing filter replacements might seem steep, the long-term benefits of having cleaner water throughout the house make it worthwhile. Compared to other systems in its range, it’s an affordable solution for improving water quality without compromising flow rate or ease of use.

The research will include:
- Identification of the most likely candidates for the papacy.
- Assessment of potential kingmakers—those with significant influence over the voting process.
- Analysis of how ideological divisions (e.g., conservative vs. progressive), regional representation, and past positions on Vatican policies may impact the election.
- Consideration of historical conclave patterns to determine probabilities for different candidates.
- A simulated round-by-round breakdown of the voting results, estimating which Cardinals are likely to support which candidates at each stage.
- A concluding narrative describing the key events, negotiations, and dynamics within the conclave, including how external factors (global Church concerns, geopolitical influence, recent Vatican events) may shape the outcome.

# Predicting the 2025 Papal Conclave: A College of Cardinals Analysis

## Most Likely Papal Candidates (Papabili)  
Several cardinals stand out as **papabili** – those often mentioned as strong contenders for the papacy. These men have the stature, experience, and support base that could garner significant votes in a conclave. Based on reputation, influence, and historical patterns, the leading candidates include:

- **Cardinal Pietro Parolin (Italy, 70):** Vatican Secretary of State since 2013 and the highest-ranking elector. A seasoned diplomat regarded as a sensible **moderate** – he eschews clear “left” or “right” labels. Parolin’s centrist approach and extensive diplomatic achievements (he helped broker the Cuba-U.S. rapprochement and engaged in dialogue on Ukraine) make him a consensus figure. Bookmakers have even named him a favorite to succeed Francis.

- **Cardinal Péter Erdő (Hungary, 72):** Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest and former president of European bishops. Erdő is a prominent **conservative** voice known for defending traditional doctrine – he opposed communion for remarried Catholics and likened accepting refugees to *“human trafficking”*. A protégé of St. John Paul II (made cardinal in 2003), he maintains a good relationship with Hungary’s right-wing leader Viktor Orbán. Erdő’s strong ties with African bishops – he has organized joint meetings between European and African prelates – could broaden his support beyond Europe. Some observers note that if European and African cardinals vote together, Erdő could muster a formidable bloc (those regions account for roughly 72 votes).

- **Cardinal Luis Antonio “Chito” Tagle (Philippines, 67):** Pro-prefect of the Dicastery for Evangelization and former Archbishop of Manila. Tagle, often dubbed *“the Asian Pope Francis,”* is a **progressive** who shares Francis’s pastoral approach. Made a cardinal by Benedict XVI in 2012, he has since advocated for a more inclusive Church, criticizing harsh language toward gay people, unwed mothers, and the divorced. Tagle’s charisma and status as a leading figure from the Global South (he would be the first Asian pope) make him a symbol of the Church’s growing diversity.

- **Cardinal Matteo Zuppi (Italy, 69):** Archbishop of Bologna and President of the Italian Bishops’ Conference. A favorite of Pope Francis, Zuppi was elevated in 2019 and has been entrusted with sensitive peace missions (he traveled to Ukraine to meet President Zelensky and to the U.S. amid the Russia-Ukraine war). Aligned with the progressive Sant’Egidio community, Zuppi has shown pastoral openness – he even contributed an essay advocating new pastoral approaches for *“our LGBT brothers and sisters”*. His blend of Francis-like compassion with Italian roots makes him a bridge between reformist and traditional circles.

- **Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu (DR Congo, 63):** Archbishop of Kinshasa and a rising leader among African bishops. Ambongo has emerged as a vocal **conservative** within the Francis-era Church, boldly flying to Rome in 2024 to deliver African bishops’ concerns about a papal document allowing blessings of same-sex couples. If elected, he would be the first African pope in modern history. He leads an African bloc of 17 electors, and his staunch stances on moral issues appeal to traditionalists. His influence could either propel his own candidacy or make him a kingmaker for another conservative candidate.

*Other names* occasionally mentioned include **Cardinal Peter Turkson (Ghana, 76)** – a moderate social-justice voice who would be the first black African pope – and **Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich (Luxembourg, 65)**, a key figure in the Synod on Synodality often seen as a reformist. Additionally, **Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa (Italy, 59)**, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem with decades of Middle East experience, recently entered discussions as a surprise candidate who could continue Francis’s legacy. Meanwhile, prominent **traditionalists** like Cardinal Gerhard Müller (Germany, 77) and Cardinal Raymond Burke (USA, 76) are considered long shots; they have a dedicated following but are seen as too divisive to garner the needed two-thirds support.

## Key Voting Influences and Blocs  
When the **College of Cardinals** enters a conclave, each cardinal’s background and views profoundly shape the voting dynamics. In the 2025 conclave, several key influences are expected to play a role:

- **Ideological Leanings – Progressive vs. Conservative:** Pope Francis has appointed about 110 of the ~140 electors, ostensibly a “progressive” majority. However, this majority is far from monolithic. The Francis-era cardinals hold *“wildly diverging views”* on issues like the role of women in the Church and attitudes toward LGBTQ faithful. Many think for themselves, and it’s **“complete nonsense”** to assume they all *“think like Francis”* simply because he appointed them. On the right, a substantial conservative minority (including holdovers from John Paul II and Benedict XVI, roughly two dozen electors) will rally behind doctrinal purists and could block candidates seen as too liberal. These ideological fault lines – evident in public clashes (e.g. Cardinal Burke condemning Francis’s openness to communion for the divorced as *“objectionable”*, or Cardinal Eijk rebuking ecumenical outreach as *“a drift towards apostasy”*) – mean the conclave may pit **reformers** against **traditionalists** in early ballots.

- **Regional Representation – Geographic Blocs:** The College has never been more global. Europe still holds the largest share of electors (55 as of early 2025), with Italy alone accounting for 17. But non-European influence is at an all-time high. Latin America, Africa, and Asia together comprise roughly half of the voters, reflecting the Church’s demographic shift. Asia has 24 electors (including growing voices from the Philippines, India, and beyond). Africa has about 17 electors and a strong desire to have its booming church better represented at the highest level. North America (about 14 electors split between the U.S. and Canada) and Oceania (4 electors) are smaller in number but can still be swing votes. Cardinals often form voting alliances along regional lines – for instance, African cardinals under Ambongo may coordinate to support a candidate attentive to developing-world issues, or Italians might initially coalesce around one of their countrymen to reclaim the papacy after four decades. However, Francis’s practice of elevating cardinals from *“far-flung”* places who rarely interacted means some of these geographic blocs are less cohesive than in the past. Many of these cardinals are strangers to each other, limiting the traditional regional caucusing. In fact, they’ve had to rely on online dossiers summarizing each cardinal’s profile to learn about one another before voting!

- **Past Positions on Church Reforms:** How cardinals have aligned on recent Vatican policies will heavily influence their vote. Key among these are issues from the Francis era: implementation of **Synodality**, approaches to divorced and remarried Catholics, LGBTQ blessings, curial reform, and emphasis on social justice. Electors who champion Francis’s reforms (e.g. Cardinals Tagle, Zuppi, and Hollerich) will push for a pope who continues that trajectory. In contrast, electors alarmed by what they perceive as doctrinal laxity have signaled they’ll support a course-correction candidate. For example, after Pope Francis encouraged exploration of blessing same-sex unions, Cardinal Ambongo emerged as a spokesman for those opposed, bringing African bishops’ complaints directly to Rome. Likewise, Cardinal Eijk’s public criticisms of Francis’s moves on intercommunion and remarriage show a cadre of cardinals poised to vote for a more **traditionalist** pontiff. These divisions over Vatican policy suggest that in the conclave, **reformist** cardinals will initially gravitate to figures like Tagle or Zuppi, while **status-quo or conservative** cardinals will line up behind figures like Erdő, Eijk, or others who voiced reservations about Francis’s changes.

- **Personal Relationships and Alliances:** Despite limited face-to-face interaction as a full college, smaller circles of cardinals have formed relationships that could translate into voting blocs. Many curial cardinals (those serving in Rome) know each other well and may act in concert; these include Francis’s top aides who, ironically, span the spectrum from progressives to *“closet conservatives”*. For instance, Cardinals in the Roman Curia – even those all appointed by Francis – are not automatically allied; some liberal-leaning members could quietly team up to support a reformist candidate, while more conservative-leaning curial figures might coalesce around a moderate as a bulwark against a progressive. Outside Rome, regional alliances matter: Latin American cardinals share a fraternal bond via CELAM and many were mentored by Pope Francis, so they might collectively favor a candidate who will continue his pastoral focus. The 10 American cardinals, for their part, have historically not voted as one bloc (they split between moderates and conservatives), but they represent a significant **swing vote** weight. Influential individuals can also sway friends: for example, in the 2013 conclave Cardinal Angelo Scola (then a leading candidate) ultimately directed his supporters to back Jorge Bergoglio, helping pave Francis’s path. Similar behind-the-scenes kingmaking could happen in 2025 if, say, an Italian candidate like Zuppi releases his supporters to Parolin in order to prevent a deadlock.

In summary, the voting will be shaped by a complex interplay of ideology, geography, track records, and personal networks. With nearly **63% of electors being “Bergoglian” (appointed by Francis) but many of them unknown to each other, and with Europeans now a minority of the college, the conclave’s dynamics are unusually fluid. As one Vatican analyst noted, despite Francis’ appointments, *“it is by no means certain”* that the next pope will share Francis’s profile. The stage is set for a delicate balance of power where no single faction can dominate outright – making compromise and coalition-building decisive.

## Potential Kingmakers and Influencers  
Beyond the papabili themselves, certain cardinals (and groups of cardinals) will play outsized roles in shaping the conclave’s outcome. These **“kingmakers”** are not necessarily aiming to be pope, but their support or tactical decisions can deliver victory to someone else:

- **Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo & the African Bloc:** With 17 African electors – a record high – Africa’s collective voice is strong. As the most prominent African churchman under 80, Ambongo can galvanize this bloc. If he senses that an African papabile (including himself) cannot win, he could become a power broker by directing African votes toward a candidate who will champion the global South’s interests. His endorsement would carry weight for any conservative-leaning candidate seeking African support. For instance, should he throw Africa’s backing behind Erdő, it might push the Hungarian close to the finish line (European and African votes combined approach the two-thirds threshold). Conversely, if Ambongo finds common cause with a moderate or progressive (perhaps extracting commitments on issues like poverty or conflict in Africa), he could swing a large bloc in that direction. His role as a bridge between continents and as a custodian of traditional values makes him a potential kingmaker in either a conservative coalition or a North-South alliance.

- **Cardinal Pietro Parolin (if not front-runner):** Parolin will obviously be a leading candidate, but in the scenario he doesn’t garner enough early support, his position and persona still give him kingmaker leverage. As Secretary of State, Parolin knows virtually every elector personally and holds tremendous respect across ideological lines. If he were, say, to be eclipsed by two stalemate candidates (one progressive, one conservative), Parolin could emerge as the *compromise* broker – possibly even throwing his support to another and convincing his considerable base of moderates to follow suit. His close connections to cardinals from Europe, Latin America, and Asia (thanks to Vatican diplomatic work) position him to negotiate deals. For example, Parolin might promise continued Vatican diplomatic efforts (important to many moderates) in exchange for progressives and conservatives rallying around a single candidate to avoid protracted division.

- **Cardinal Matteo Zuppi and other Francis Allies:** Figures like Zuppi, Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich, Cardinal Oswald Gracias (if he were still eligible), and Cardinal Gérald Lacroix (Quebec) are influential among the reformist wing. Zuppi in particular, as head of the Italian bishops, can sway many of the 17 Italian votes – historically a decisive bloc. If Zuppi finds his own path to the papacy blocked, he might use his sway in the Italian caucus to anoint another. For instance, Zuppi could ask his Italian supporters to back Parolin (another Italian) to ensure the papacy returns to Italy, or to back Tagle to continue Francis’s legacy, depending on what he deems best for the Church. Similarly, Cardinal Hollerich (the synod relator general) commands trust among the pro-synodality cardinals (from Europe and beyond) and could rally them behind a candidate who will carry forward the synodal reforms. These progressive-leaning “inner circle” cardinals, many of whom have worked closely with Francis, will likely coordinate their approach to prevent a curial conservative from reversing Francis’s course. Their behind-the-scenes consensus could make one of their number (or their favored alternate) the rallying point for all reform-minded electors.

- **The Silent Traditionalist Coalition:** On the opposite side, a handful of elder statesmen cardinals act as figureheads for the traditionalist minority. Cardinals Raymond Burke, Gerhard Müller, and Wim Eijk – each outspoken in critiques of Francis – hold moral sway over like-minded electors even if they themselves cannot win. Burke and Müller, for example, have a global network of admirers and may influence some American, European, and even Asian cardinals who desire a return to doctrinal strictness. While their personal following inside the conclave is limited (perhaps a dozen votes at most initially), they can act as kingmakers by uniting this faction behind a single viable conservative candidate (likely Erdő or another with broader appeal). In 2013, traditionalists eventually coalesced behind Cardinal Scola in early rounds; in 2025, they might similarly line up behind Erdő or Eijk. Should Burke and Müller signal to their allies to support one man, that could boost that candidate’s total by a critical margin in later ballots. Even just 10-15 votes moved as a bloc can tip the balance in a tight race. Thus, the **“traditionalist caucus,”** though small, could be pivotal if the conclave is divided and every vote counts.

- **The Curial Cardinals and Other Influencers:** A number of cardinals in key leadership roles or with high visibility will influence broader groups through quiet lobbying. For instance, **Cardinal Kevin Farrell** (Camerlengo, an American in Rome) straddles factions and might coordinate transatlantic understanding among electors. **Cardinal Fernando Vérgez** (governor of Vatican City, though he turns 80 in 2025) and **Cardinal Mario Grech** (Secretary of the Synod) are also figures who connect with many peers. The Dean of the College, **Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re** (though over 80 and not voting), and other senior cardinals present in Rome often host informal gatherings before the conclave where consensus can form. Moreover, the **American cardinals as a group** – though ideologically split – have a history of being well-prepared and influential in general congregations (the meetings before the conclave). Personal bonds, such as those among bishops who attended synods together or who worked in the same regions, may lead to mini-alliances (e.g. **Latin American** cardinals aligning with Tagle due to shared outlook from CELAM meetings, or **Asian** cardinals from mission territories gravitating to a candidate with evangelization focus). In short, even cardinals not individually papabili can act as power brokers by marshalling their circle of influence toward a common voting strategy. Every vote that moves in concert under a respected “patron” figure brings a candidate closer to the  **two-thirds majority** needed (which, with 138 electors, is 92 votes).

Overall, these kingmakers will operate through persuasion and coalition-building. Given that Pope Francis’s overhaul of the College reduced the old routine of frequent cardinals’ gatherings, the **initial ballots** will be critical for revealing natural alliances. After the first vote, expect intense whispering and subtle signals from these influencers as they encourage blocs of votes to shift toward their preferred contender.

## Voting Pattern Predictions (Simulated Ballots)  
Under the Sistine Chapel’s frescoed ceiling, the cardinal electors will cast their secret ballots up to four times a day (two in the morning, two in the afternoon) until a new Pope is chosen. We can anticipate a **round-by-round evolution** of the vote as alliances form and candidates gain or lose momentum. Below is a **simulated voting breakdown** for a hypothetical conclave in mid-2025, with analysis of how and why the numbers might shift each round. (The winning target is **92 votes**, the requisite two-thirds of 138 electors.) This scenario assumes the major candidates identified earlier all enter the conclave with some support:

| **Candidate**                 | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** | **Round 5** (Final) |
|-------------------------------|------------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|--------------------:|
| *P. Parolin (Moderate)*       | 30 votes    | 38 votes    | 40 votes    | 80 votes    | **94 votes** ✅ |
| *P. Erdő (Conservative)*      | 25 votes    | 34 votes    | 46 votes    | 50 votes    | 44 votes          |
| *L. Tagle (Progressive)*      | 20 votes    | 28 votes    | 32 votes    | 8 votes     | — (withdrawn)     |
| *M. Zuppi (Progressive)*      | 18 votes    | 22 votes    | 15 votes    | — (withdrawn) | —                |
| *F. Ambongo (Afr. bloc)*      | 10 votes    | 8 votes     | — (thrown to Erdő) | —        | —                |
| *Other candidates (combined)* | 35 votes    | 8 votes     | 5 votes     | 0           | 0                 |

**Round 1:** In the first ballot, cardinals tend to vote for a wide array of candidates – some essentially as *trial balloons* or personal tributes. No one is ever elected on the first round in modern times. Here we project **Cardinal Parolin** leading with around 30 votes, reflecting early support from centrists and some Europeans who know him well. **Cardinal Erdő** might follow with ~25 votes, drawing most of the staunch conservatives (especially from Europe) and a portion of African votes. **Cardinal Tagle** and **Cardinal Zuppi** might each garner around 15–20 votes, splitting the progressive camp (Tagle picking up many Asian and Latin American electors who admire Pope Francis’s legacy, and Zuppi drawing support from Italian and Western European progressives aligned with Francis’s pastoral style). **Cardinal Ambongo** could attract ~10 votes, primarily from African electors eager to see one of their own in serious contention. The remaining ~35 votes would scatter among *“other”* candidates – for example, a few votes for Cardinal Eijk from ultra-conservatives, a few for Cardinal Hollerich or other notable regionals, and some favorite-son votes from various countries. (In 2013’s first round, votes were similarly distributed among about a dozen names.) The first ballot thus indicates the **broad outlines** of the factions: Parolin (center), Erdő (right), Tagle/Zuppi (left), with no one near the 92-vote goal.

**Round 2:** After an initial ballot, the cardinals pause and discreetly assess who has momentum. By the second ballot, some minor candidates typically drop off as their supporters move to more viable contenders. In our simulation, many of the *“other”* 35 votes from Round 1 shift in Round 2. For instance, cardinals who initially voted for long-shot Europeans like Eijk or Müller likely swing behind **Erdő** (seeing him as the strongest standard-bearer for their conservative principles). This could boost Erdő to the mid-30s. Likewise, a few who voted for various missionaries or reformers might consolidate behind Tagle or Zuppi, nudging their totals upward slightly. **Parolin**’s camp also grows, perhaps absorbing votes from moderate voters who initially flirted with less-known candidates but now coalesce around the steady center. By Round 2, Parolin could be pushing 38–40 votes. **Ambongo**, if he senses his chances slipping, might hang on for one more round with a slightly lower total (as a couple of African voters drift to Erdő or even to Tagle hoping to elevate an outsider). The second vote often remains inconclusive but clarifies the **front-runners**. Let’s say by now Parolin, Erdő, and Tagle clearly occupy the top three spots, with Zuppi close behind Tagle. The *black smoke* continues to rise from the Sistine Chapel chimney, signaling “no pope yet” to the world waiting outside.

**Round 3:** This is typically the first ballot of the conclave’s second day, where real **alignments start to form**. Deals and promises made overnight (in whispered conversations at dinner in the Casa Santa Marta residence) begin to bear fruit. Minor candidates by now almost certainly withdraw or lose all traction. We assume **Cardinal Ambongo** decides at this point to throw his support behind Cardinal Erdő (choosing to bolster the conservative bloc rather than dilute it). The African votes under Ambongo’s influence largely transfer to Erdő, possibly giving Erdő a significant bump (he could surge to around 45–50 votes). Sensing a threat that Erdő might run away with the election, the progressive wing likely responds by consolidating their votes. Since Tagle was leading Zuppi slightly in previous rounds, many pro-Francis electors might rally to **Tagle as the single standard-bearer** for continuity. Cardinal Zuppi, recognizing the need for unity among like-minded cardinals, may voluntarily withdraw his candidacy at this stage (perhaps in exchange for an understanding that he would have an important role in a Tagle or Parolin papacy). Zuppi’s supporters – Italians and others – then shift mostly to Tagle (some Italians might reluctantly move to Parolin instead, given Tagle is an Asian outsider). This consolidation could propel Tagle’s total up to the 30s or even around 40. **Parolin**, however, is still very much in the mix. Many moderates and those who prefer a compromise begin weighing the risk of a polarizing figure winning. Parolin’s vote count might hold steady or grow slightly (into the low 40s) as a few undecided cardinals cast an “insurance vote” for the middle option. By the end of Round 3, the likely vote spread could be something like: Parolin ~40, Erdő ~46, Tagle ~40 – a three-way deadlock, all well short of 92. This scenario – three strong candidates – is reminiscent of the 2013 conclave early on, when votes were split between Scola, Bergoglio, and Ouellet. Such a stalemate sets the stage for **intense negotiations** before the next ballots.

**Round 4:** At this juncture, the cardinals pause for lunch and prayer, aware that the conclave cannot drag on indefinitely without risking fractures. Typically, by the afternoon of the second day, a breakthrough is in sight. The **kingmakers** now step forward behind closed doors. We posit that the progressive camp, realizing Erdő is still climbing thanks to a disciplined conservative bloc, decides to pivot to ensure a candidate palatable to most can beat him. Tagle, while beloved by many, may face quiet resistance from some Europeans and curial cardinals who fear an abrupt change or simply hesitate to choose a non-Western pope. Sensing this, Tagle (possibly guided by influential friends like Cardinal Gracias or Cardinal Hollerich) might **gracefully withdraw** his candidacy for the sake of unity. He could implore his supporters to back Cardinal Parolin – the rationale being that Parolin, as a moderate, would both continue much of Francis’s agenda and assuage those worried about experience and governance. This is a critical turning point: once Tagle releases his ~40 votes, a large majority of them likely flock to Parolin. Parolin’s count shoots up dramatically (our table shows ~80) as Latin Americans, Asians, and moderate Europeans coalesce around him as the compromise. Erdő, on the other hand, hits a ceiling. Even with all remaining conservatives and a few lingering undecided votes, he might max out around 50. Some who had backed Erdő earlier could peel away at this stage, realizing the **writing on the wall** that a staunch conservative will not secure two-thirds. By the end of Round 4, **Parolin is within striking distance** of the papacy, maybe a dozen votes short, with nearly all other candidacies effectively collapsed. Such a scenario mirrors the dynamics of previous conclaves where a compromise candidate surged ahead late (for example, Cardinal Wojtyła’s leap on the second day of the 1978 conclave).

**Round 5:** If needed, a fifth ballot would likely be the final one. At this point, the conclave has essentially become a referendum on Parolin vs. Erdő – continuity-in-moderation vs. a sharp conservative turn. The remaining holdouts face heavy pressure to avoid prolonging the conclave. Historical accounts note that once a candidate appears inevitable, many opposing voters will switch to give a sense of near-unanimity (the *“bandwagon”* effect in conclaves). Thus, in the final ballot we’d expect Cardinal Parolin to pick up the last handful of votes needed from among those who had been clinging to Erdő or other alternatives. Perhaps a core of die-hard traditionalists (say ~40) stick with Erdő to the end, unwilling to yield. But the rest (including some who earlier backed Erdő, seeing no path for him) move to Parolin, putting him over the 92-vote threshold. We project Parolin might secure around **94 votes**, comfortably above two-thirds, making him the **new Pope**. White smoke would then dramatically billow from the Sistine Chapel chimney, announcing to the world that a pope has been chosen ([File:White smoke from Sistine Chapel.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:White_smoke_from_Sistine_Chapel.jpg)) *White smoke emerging from the Sistine Chapel chimney in Vatican City, signaling the election of a new pope.* 

This simulated narrative is just one plausible outcome. The conclave could break a different way – for instance, if the progressive bloc were more united from the start, a candidate like Tagle might reach the needed majority after a similar number of rounds, or if conservatives manage an unlikely coalition with enough moderates, someone like Erdő could prevail. But given current indications, a **centrist consensus candidate** (embodied here by Parolin) stands the best chance after successive ballots. Notably, in the real 2013 conclave, Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio started with only 26 votes on the first ballot yet reached 85 votes by the final ballot as different groups swung behind him. Our Parolin scenario parallels that kind of trajectory, reflecting how quickly things can change once momentum builds and electors unify their vision of the ideal candidate.

The **voting pattern** in this hypothetical conclave underscores a few key trends: initial fragmentation giving way to consolidation, the defeat of polarized candidates by a compromise, and the influential role of behind-the-scenes negotiations in swinging large blocs of votes. Round by round, what begins as up to a half-dozen serious candidacies narrows to two, and finally one, as cardinals seek to achieve consensus under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and their collective sense of the Church’s needs.

## External Factors Shaping the Outcome  
A papal election does not occur in a vacuum. Broader **global Church concerns, geopolitical contexts, and recent Vatican events** will weigh on the cardinal electors’ minds and impact how they vote and whom they favor. In 2025, several external factors are especially pertinent:

- **Global Issues and Church Priorities:** The new pope will immediately confront challenges such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, the climate crisis, migrant flows, and the secularization of traditionally Catholic societies. Electors will consider who is best suited to be a moral voice on the world stage. For example, Cardinal Zuppi’s peace-building mission to war-torn Ukraine and Cardinal Parolin’s diplomatic engagement in international conflicts suggest both have experience in delicate geopolitical situations. Cardinals from countries experiencing violence or persecution may lean toward someone who has spoken out on justice and peace (perhaps favoring candidates like Zuppi, Tagle, or Turkson). Meanwhile, those from the Western world grappling with secularism and aggressive secular ideologies might prefer a pope capable of re-evangelizing disaffected Catholics – perhaps a dynamic communicator like Tagle or a firm teacher like Erdő. Concerns about climate change and poverty could boost cardinals known for social teaching (Tagle or Turkson), aligning with Francis’s priorities on the environment and the poor. In sum, the profile of the “ideal pope” in many electors’ eyes will be shaped by what issues they believe the Church must address most urgently in the coming years.

- **Continuity vs. Course Correction:** The conclave follows a dramatic pontificate in Pope Francis. His papacy emphasized pastoral outreach, decentralization (via the Synod process), and a less formal style of papal authority. Some electors will feel it’s critical to continue this trajectory to address unresolved initiatives – such as implementing the global Synod on Synodality’s outcomes in 2025–26, carrying forward curial reform, and expanding roles for laity and women in Church governance. These electors are likely to back a candidate who has signaled support for Francis’s reforms (e.g. Tagle, Zuppi, or Hollerich). On the other hand, there is an undercurrent among some in the College that the next pope should “restore balance” by re-emphasizing doctrinal clarity and traditional liturgy, areas where they feel Francis de-emphasized. This sentiment might incline votes toward a figure like Erdő or Eijk who would represent a gentle **course correction**. The choice of the new pope will thus send a signal: either a vote of confidence in Francis’s path or a subtle shift in emphasis. It’s worth noting that conclaves often follow the saying, *“after a fat pope, a thin pope,”* implying a contrast with the previous pontiff. Francis has been seen as a “progressive” and pastor-pope; the cardinals might seek a more administrative, doctrinal figure this time – though one not as conservative as to be divisive. Parolin in many ways embodies continuity in substance with a change in style (he is mild-mannered and diplomatically cautious), which could appeal broadly. Electors will be measuring how each papabile might steer the Barque of Peter in response to Francis’s legacy.

- **Recent Crises and Scandals:** The Church continues to face the fallout of the sexual abuse crisis, financial scandals in the Vatican, and governance challenges. Cardinals will consider who can best clean house and rebuild trust. A candidate with a reputation for zero-tolerance on abuse or for curial savvy might get a boost. For instance, Cardinal Seán O’Malley of Boston (now over 80 and not voting, but symbolically important for abuse reforms) had significant support in 2013’s early ballots; his legacy might influence votes toward someone who champions accountability. Cardinal Parolin’s experience in Vatican administration could be seen as an asset here, as might the perspective of a non-European who has witnessed church corruption issues from afar (Tagle dealt with governance in a huge archdiocese; Ambongo has fought corruption and abuse in Congo). The way each candidate is perceived relative to handling scandal – either by being an insider who can control it, or an outsider who can purge it – will factor into electors’ deliberations about the Church’s credibility.

- **Geopolitical Considerations:** The electors know the papacy has global diplomatic and interfaith implications. Relations with major world powers (like China, where a delicate Vatican-Beijing accord is ongoing), and with Islam, are in play. Parolin negotiated the China deal, which might be a pro or a con in some cardinals’ eyes (some criticize that deal’s concessions). A pope from the developing world (Latin America, Africa, or Asia) could profoundly impact inter-religious dialogue and the Church’s image: for example, a Pope Tagle might engage the Islamic world and Asia’s political powers in new ways due to his background. Meanwhile, a European pope might have more immediate rapport with European governments but would need to show sensitivity to the non-Western world. Also, the **cultural wars** in the West – on sexuality, gender, and human rights – mean that a new pope’s stance could either heighten conflict or find new balance. A more conservative pope might clash with secular governments (as Francis did at times, though he also had admirers for his social stances), whereas a moderate might build bridges. The cardinals will weigh how each papabile might handle external pressure: Who can robustly defend the faith in the public square? Who can also speak to youth disillusioned by scandal or apathy? These questions tie back to global perceptions. There is even the consideration of **symbolism**: electing the first Asian or African pope would itself send a powerful message to the world about the universality of the Church – something many cardinals find appealing, though they must balance it against the individual candidate’s qualifications.

- **Timing and the Jubilee Year:** One very immediate context is that 2025 is a scheduled **Jubilee Year** in the Church. Pope Francis has planned events for this Holy Year. If a conclave happens in 2025, the new pope will inherit the Jubilee preparations or early execution. Cardinals might lean toward a candidate capable of quickly stepping into that role of spiritual leadership for the Jubilee’s worldwide pilgrimages and liturgies. A personable, linguistically versatile pope would be ideal to energize the crowds and media during the Jubilee – qualities found in Tagle (engaging and multilingual) and Zuppi. Conversely, the demands of a Jubilee could argue for a younger and vigorous pope who can handle the travel and schedule; this might slightly disadvantage older candidates in their late 70s. The conclave’s timing also follows Francis’s serious illness in late 2024 ([How Pope Francis is ensuring a progressive next pontiff](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/02/25/pope-francis-vatican-electing-successor-college-cardinals/#:~:text=On%20Monday%20evening%2C%20in%20a,he%20suffered%20at%20the%20weekend)), which had already set off murmurs of conclave preparation. Cardinals, having prayed for Francis during that health scare, will be contemplative about the fragility of life – they may prefer not to elect another very elderly pope who might face immediate health issues. This could tilt preferences toward those in their late 60s or early 70s (Tagle, Zuppi, even Ambongo) over the mid-to-late 70s (like Müller or Turkson or even Parolin at 70 is fine). Longevity to carry forward long-term projects (like continuing synodal reforms or implementing new evangelization strategies) is a subtle but real factor.

In essence, the conclave is as much about the **future direction of the Church** in the world as it is about the candidates themselves. Every elector will be asking: *Which of these men is best suited to lead the Church in our present historical moment?* Their votes will be cast not only on personal familiarity or holiness, but with an eye to how the next pope will engage with political leaders, address social ills, and shepherd the 1.3 billion Catholics through the storms and opportunities of our time.

## Conclave Narrative: Likely Events and Power Dynamics  
As the cardinals gather in the Vatican for the conclave (sealed off from the world without phones or media), a **dramatic sequence** of events and interactions is set in motion. Drawing from past conclaves and the present context, we can sketch a likely narrative of how things unfold inside those frescoed walls:

**Pre-Conclave Maneuvering:** In the days leading up to the conclave, all the cardinals (including those over 80 who won’t vote) meet in General Congregations. These plenary sessions allow cardinals to give speeches about the state of the Church and the qualities needed in a new pope. It’s here that early themes emerge: one cardinal might stress the need for evangelization and continuity, while another calls for strong governance and doctrinal clarity. Behind the podium speeches, private conversations carry equal weight. Over coffee breaks and dinners at their lodging (the Santa Marta residence), cardinals sounding each other out will begin to identify who the leading contenders are. For example, Latin American and Asian cardinals might hold an informal meetup, quietly agreeing that they’d love to see Tagle or another non-European as pope. Similarly, Europeans concerned about secularism might discuss rallying around a figure like Erdő or an Italian. These **whispered agreements** set the stage, though all enter the Sistine Chapel on Day 1 maintaining an outward show of openness.",1,1740670287.0,u_Sudden_Profit_8659,0,1.0,False

Is Lumon taking advantage of Mark and Gemma’s emotional connection in a way similar to how the real-world machines in *The Matrix Resurrections* exploit Neo and Trinity’s bond?  

For those unfamiliar with the latest *Matrix* movie, one of its premises is that keeping Neo and Trinity in pods—close enough but without touching—generates a huge amount of energy due to their incredible emotional connection, which the machines harness.  

I think Lumon is doing something similar with Mark and Gemma. It uses the drama/romance that Mark experiences internally to make his work exceptionally good, which is why he is the right person to complete Cold Harbor—somehow linked to emotions, just like the ""scary numbers"" are. Keeping a version of Gemma so close, along with their *wellness* sessions, allows Mark to channel that energy into his work at a subconscious level, without even knowing why.  

In fact, in *The Matrix Resurrections*, in this new *clean slate* version of the Matrix, Neo and Trinity meet in a coffee shop and seem to like each other, but they don’t know who they really are because they have new identities. Yet, their emotional connection appears to have survived the reset.  
I remember that in Ms. Casey’s last *wellness* session with Mark, she hints that she feels good being near him. In fact, right after that, Cobel sends her to the testing floor.  

The presence of code and numbers—understood only by a select few—in both shows makes this parallel even clearer to me.

Café Of Living Nightmares

Ariana Maller is a normal person in the sense that she has feelings, but she has a mental illness, she never saw it as an illness, in her eyes, it was more of a quirk. Her specific illness is schizophrenia. She was a competent human being.
And this morning is not just any morning cause this day is her first day on the job.

Chapter 1:

She set her alarm to very early in the morning to ensure she wouldn't oversleep.
When the alarm rang, she didn’t wake up at first, but she had accounted for that, she had time. When she woke up, she sat up on her bed. Her room wasn’t big, but it was comfortable. The bed was on the far right of the room from the door, in the other corner, she had a small desk, a mirror, a small box of makeup, and a chair. The floor was covered in a red, full-cover carpet. She stood up and walked to the other side of the bed where there was a wardrobe, she opened it and started to put on some fresh clothes. Her outfit that day was some black denim and a generic white t-shirt. She groggily walked over to her makeup table, sat down, opened the small box, picked up a hair brush, and started brushing her hair. She wasn’t very awake yet, so she closed her eyes tiredly and drifted off into her thoughts. She stayed like that for a while until a whispering starkly woke her up again. She was used to the hallucinations cause they had been with her all her life, but this time she wasn’t ready. She turned around and, in the corner of her room, she saw something smile at her, she was used to their appearance, this one in particular was completely black and had no limbs, the only thing she could see was its eyes and teeth. She promptly turned back around and continued with her morning routine, this time a bit more awake. She looked into the mirror onto her face. She has straight black hair down to her shoulders, a round head, brown eyes, a small nose, a thin mouth, and pale skin. She put on some light foundation and light blush, reached for her eyeliner, and realized she was supposed to pick up some yesterday because she had used the last of it for her job interview.
It was probably going to be fine. It’s not the end of the world it’s just eyeliner. She stood up briskly and started walking to the door. She stubbed her toe on a footrest she had forgotten about.
“Damn it,” She exclaims, trying not to wake her parents.

She clambers out the door and looks around to see if anyone's awake. To her right, the hallway continues to the front door. To her left, the hallway leads into the living room and kitchen. In front of her, there is a door, and luckily for her, that door leads to the bathroom.
She opens the door and steps in. The bathroom is small. Inside, there is a small shower, a toilet, and a sink with a mirror over it. The mirror is also a shelf, which she opens and pulls out her toothbrush and some toothpaste.
She put some toothpaste on the brush and started brushing. Once again, she heard whispering this time, she didn’t give it a thought. She finished brushing but forgot her medicine.

She walked out of the bathroom and turned toward the kitchen. At the end of the hallway, the pathway split, and to the left is the kitchen. She turned into the kitchen.
The kitchen is larger than the bathroom but not as big as her bedroom. Directly to the left of the door is a fridge and freezer. She opened the fridge, took out some butter and cheese, and laid them out on the kitchen counter next to it. She then continued along the counter, just after the oven, there was some more kitchen counter, but that space was taken up by a coffee machine, a box of bread, and a toaster. She opened the box, pulled out some bread, and put it in the toaster. This whole time, she had been thinking about her new job. She was thinking about what she would do with the new income. She wanted some independence from her parents to start paying her own bills. With a loud “k’chink” the toaster was done toasting the bread. She carefully, so as not to burn herself, pulled the toast out of the toaster and set it on the kitchen counter next to the cheese and butter.
She bent down, opened the shelf under the counter, and pulled out a knife and a cheese slicer. She buttered the toast, sliced some cheese, and put together the sandwich.
She looked up at the shelves above her, opened one, and pulled out a glass.
She turned around to use the sink on the other side of the kitchen. She pulled on the handle, and the sink turned on. She fills the glass with water, turns off the sink, picks up her sandwich, and walks to the living room. The living room is the biggest in the apartment. The couch is on the right of the entrance to the room. In front of the couch, there is a table. Further in front of it, there is a small table, and on it, there is a TV.
The table was on a rug with a swirl pattern. And two potted plants, one on each side of the TV. Ariana doesn’t know what type of plant they are, but she finds them soothing.
She sat down on the couch and started eating her breakfast. Just now, she realized her toast was burnt. She picked up her phone and looked at the time. She has about an hour left before she needs to go. She finishes her breakfast and puts her glass in the sink.

She returned to her room, laid down on her bed, and sighed. This was going to be her first day on the job it was going to be perfect. She stood back up but decided to lie down again. She looks at her phone again, about ten minutes have passed. She groaned, she couldn’t wait to start her day. She picked up her phone and searched the café on Google to look at some pictures. From the outside, the cafe has big windows with the café’s logo stuck on the window, probably a sticker, and there are a couple of tables and chairs in front of the logo, up where the window ends in big letters, the name of the café stands.
She looks at the time and sees that it's time to go. She stood up, walked out of her room, and turned right towards the exit. To her left was a cabinet, and to her right were some hooks where all the jackets, backpacks, and purses were hung. She put on a black leather jacket. Then she remembered she needed to turn off all the lights, and she walked through the house, turning off all the lights she had turned on. Then she walked back to the door.
At that moment, her mom had woken up and walked out of her room.
“You're leaving for work?” she asked.
“Yeah, Mom, it’s my first day today,” Ariana Answered Gladly while packing her purse. “I thought it was tomorrow. Well, good luck, see you this afternoon.” Ariana opened the door saying, “See you then”.

Ariana lives on the second floor of an apartment building that is in the small town of Jenburg. The hallway for this apartment was very simple it was about five to six meters long with three other apartments. The floor was made of marble, and the walls were white, with two lamps hanging from the left wall at an equal distance. To the left was a staircase leading down to ground level.
The ground level had no apartments, but it did have some mailboxes and another staircase leading down to the basement. The look of the ground floor is the same as the floors above, just a bit bigger. Ariana continued out of the door. Outside, there were more apartment complexes exactly like the one Ariana lived in. The bus stop was to the left of her apartment. She walked past three apartment complexes before getting to the bus stop. The bus stop is located on a small road. There isn’t a lot around it except for all the apartment complexes. All the stores were closer to the center of town. She sits down on the small wooden bench and looks at her phone. The bus comes in about five minutes. She starts looking at the scenery. Straight ahead of the bus stop, past the road, there was a small lake. She had never really taken a good look at the lake. She could see birds flying, some were swimming, and others were diving after fish. Then the bus arrived, and she stood up and stepped on the bus. When she got on the bus, she took her wallet out of her purse and paid for a ticket.

The bus wasn’t very long, but it was very clean. Ariana sat down on one of the empty seats, put on a pair of headphones, and started playing some music. She looked out of the window. At the start of her journey, she mostly saw empty land and farms with some apartments here and there, but the closer she got to the middle of town, the more apartment complexes and shops she saw. The bus started quite empty, but soon it was full of people going to work or going to school. After about thirty minutes, she arrived at the bus stop.

She stepped off the bus onto the busy street, many people were walking around her. Not knowing exactly what direction she needed to take to get to the café, she pulled out her phone and searched for some directions. She needed to take a left and go deeper into town. The street was bigger than she was used to, on her way to the café, she walked past multiple different shops and restaurants. Then she heard whispering again, and this time, she did give it attention, she looked around after what was making the whisper. Then, she saw something indescribable. She felt an impending doom, as if she saw something she shouldn’t, a being of infinity. A film of mist covered the ground as this feeling of being small and unimportant flooded her mind. She turned around and quickly ran into the closest building.

1izi81q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1izi81q,Oversized Mocha Chocolate Chip Muffins from Vegan with a Vengeance,"These are more like cupcakes than muffins since they're so rich and cake-like. This is based on Isa's recipe in the last pic, but I adjusted quantities and ingredients for what I had on hand. The ratio of dry to liquid was about the same, but since I don't have instant coffee powder I used some vegan yogurt thinned out with extra brewed coffee instead of soy milk and coffee powder.

Since I wanted to use my oversized muffin tin I made 1.5 times the original recipe with slightly more baking powder to help it rise.


**Ingredients**

* 2 and 1/4 cups flour
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup cocoa powder
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 150g vegan yogurt (one small container, about one cup)
* 3/4 cup canola oil
* 3/4 cup coffee
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips

**Instructions**

* Preheat oven to 375F and prepare your muffin tin.
* Mix together the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder and salt.
* In a separate bowl mix the wet ingredients: coffee, canola oil, vanilla and vegan yogurt.
* Gently mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and pour into prepared muffin tin. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, let cool and enjoy!",16,1740669781.0,EatCheapAndVegan,4,1.0,False

1izi6hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCLEXsuccessStories/comments/1izi6hr/passed_at_85_using_naxlex_and_bootcamp/,Passed at 85 using Naxlex and Bootcamp,"It was a rainy Tuesday afternoon when I decided enough was enough....I made decision about passing the NCLEX. I'm a Lurker and used to hear all the horror stories from NCLEX takers. The stories revolved around the endless questions, the vague wording, the moment the screen shuts off and you’re left wondering if you are going to make it. So, I grabbed my laptop, manual revision materials, and dove into Naxlex and Bootcamp QBank, my two new best friends so far.
I started with Naxlex because, honestly, who can resist a free trial? The first thing that hit me was how real it felt. The questions weren’t just random... they were tricky, twisty, and made me think like a nurse, not just a student cramming facts. I’d sit there, chewing on my pencil, working through a case study about heart failure or a SATA that had me second-guessing everything. But the rationales? Are super Gold. They broke it all down clearly,....... why this answer,...... why not that other one and suddenly, I wasn’t just guessing anymore. I was getting it. Day after day, I’d tackle  atleast 85 questions minimum, sip my coffee, and feel a little more like I could do this. My scores started creeping up.. 50s to 60s, then high 60s...and I could almost hear my confidence whispering, “You’ve got this.”
For, Bootcamp QBank. I’d switch over in the evenings, Bootcamp was like Naxlex. Those case studies with video breakdowns? A game-changer. I’d watch them explain a six-question scenario about a patient in respiratory distress, and it was like having a mentor right there, pointing out every detail I’d missed. The standalone questions felt were helpful.. Bootcamp just nailed the vibe that well.
Weeks flew by, and I stuck to my routine: Naxlex in the morning to wake up my brain, Bootcamp at night. I’d mix in some YouTube lectures for fun—Mark Klimek was my go-to but those two QBanks were my backbone. By the time my test date reached, I was nervous but ready. I walked into that testing center with my head high, sat down, and faced those 85 questions like they were old friends. The screen shut off, my heart stopped for a second, and then… a SIGH. First try, 85 questions, done.
Looking back, Naxlex gave me the grit those tough, no-nonsense questions built my stamina. They were unstoppable. I’m a USRN now, and every time I sip my coffee, I smile, thinking about how those rainy days with Naxlex and Bootcamp turned my dream into reality.",8,1740669671.0,NCLEXsuccessStories,12,1.0,False

1izi39v,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1izi39v/what_i_would_and_wouldnt_do_differently_if_i/,What I would and wouldn't do differently if I majored in CS again,"Wassup gents, as I end my four years in college, I want to share a couple things that I've learned from my experience, talking with technical recruiters, and speaking with devs and engineers in the field.

Background for reference: Student USMC vet, two internships, 3 resume worthy projects. Please bear in mind I want this post to be a help for those considering or starting out with CS.

What I WOULD do differently:

1. Take learning into my own hands from the start

Your classes will only take you so far. **YOU** have to give a shit about your career. I wish I would've gotten involved in some projects my first semester, and started building a better github. I have a lot of cool stuff now, but I had to put in many more consecutive hours than I would've had to if I started earlier. I would've taken each semester to focus on learning a new framework, but would've found an area I liked earlier and kept that as my main focus throughout. Currently, I'm torn between fullstack web/application development and embedded systems, and had an internship for each.

2. Get involved with CS related clubs earlier.

When I joined college, as an older student vet, I didn't mesh with a lot of CS students. I let that keep me away from our ACM club, but did get involved with our Rocketry program. Having the guidance of an ACM or CS club would've definitely helped guide me with more info when I was starting out, and helped me connect with more people in the field.

3. Paid more attention in DSA/studied on the side.

In my internships, particularly my embedded systems one, Having a higher level understanding of problem solving, DSAs, and program structures was huge and presented a steep learning curve. Getting an understanding of this and practicing earlier makes a lot of stuff way easier.

4. Double major/minor.

I've seen buddies that double majored or even minored in something related to business had a bit more versatility in jobs they were qualified/competitive for.

5. Don't use AI or use it very, very minimally.

About half way through my college time I found that I was becoming to reliant on LLMs. I made a point of not using them. It was painful. But when I got to one of my final classes with a capstone project, I was able to spin up a pretty good prototype using React. My group? Couldn't do shit. No experience in even basic stuff that was covered in classes prior. There was this *heavy* reliance on LLMs that past setting up a framework, they did not understand the basic structure or how to troubleshoot.

What I **WOULDN'T** change:

1. Join non-CS related student orgs.

I ended up joining a social fraternity. Along with having a great time, there were several alumni who were my age or a year or two younger who were also developers and SWEs. I have had consistent feedback on my resume, and  as I apply for jobs, I now have referrals in their companies. Openings are tight right now, but whenever a job opens for their company, I can count on them to push my resume in the face of whoever the hiring manager is. In a couple cases, even though the opening wasn't entry level, I was able to get feedback from the hiring manager which has helped tremendously.

It doesn't have to be a frat. Join shit you think is fun. Join shit that helps you grow as a person. There is more to life than sitting in front of a screen.

2. Don't spend every waking second on CS.

I love CS. But it's not my ""hobby"". I find fulfillment in things outside of CS. I took advantage of study abroad opportunities unrelated to CS, helped with non CS engineering projects and even projects outside of STEM. Because of that I got to do a lot of cool shit and make a lot of cool friends that I wouldn't have if I focused night and day on learning to code.

3. Make a way or find one. Don't focus on what you can't control.

A little Epictetus and Aurelius goes a long way. The market sucks. I knew that. But ultimately you're not going to change off shoring in the near future. You're not going to change the economy. I made a point of not complaining or doom posting. There are still plenty of job openings. There are still ways to make yourself competitive. My experience in living some life before going to college definitely shaped my worldview on this. Life could always be far worse. Nothing I experience has not been experienced by someone else before. One of my favorite quotes came from an Insta post: ""Today will be okay, even if I have to mold it that way with my bare fucking hands"" and the background image was a coffee and a marb red pack on the table. Take a deep breath, look at what you can change, and tell yourself you're going to make it fucking happen, and let everything go as it should. It's easy to type out, hard to put into practice, but having some true grit and determination will carry you through almost anything life can throw at you.

There is no free lunch. You need to be willing to put in the hours and work to make yourself better than those around you. Do or do not.

Today, though, after the driver handed me the order, he paused and sort of held out his hand as if he was waiting for a tip. This is obviously an assumption made on a two second interaction, but it made me worried that they’re not the ones receiving the tips I leave through the app. If anyone has any experience with this, can you let me know if the drivers are the ones most likely getting the money?

I have so many goals and things I want to pursue. I've worked my ass off to be educated, informed, to work towards a better future for EVERYONE, not just myself. Then it's like all anyone can see me as is this naive girl with these big dreams, and nobody takes me serious unless I have dick to swing around. There are so many people suffering, so much hunger, homelessness, even in our rural areas. Now we have developers buying up all the land, trees, and parceling it out to build houses that nobody in our area can actually afford. Greed. It's all greed. I want so badly to get my sustainable housing effort off the ground, but than this is where my ADHD kicks my ass.... I have SO MANY different ways I want to create sustainable and affordable housing (starting local than expanding). I have data, numbers, I have house plans/blueprints, I have had this project forming in my head for years (I created an LLC in 2021 for it). Than my anti socialness punches me in the face. I am terrible at explaining anything, so of course people usually think I'm just crazy... which I am fully aware of, sometimes I think I need a translator. I'm stuck, because when I have/do reach out and try to get help from other professionals, sba, business mentors, other business owners, ect .... as soon as they realize the main focus isn't on PROFIT, they don't want to waste their time on it. 

In hindsight, I should probably focus on an income generating venture first. Especially since I decided to not go further with opening a  local coffee shop that I have been working towards the past couple years. After all the grief and sadness our family has gone through this past year, it's not the direction I am supposed to go right now. Sadly I have my garage full of my equipment, supplies, etc, that has limited market and probably won't sell for enough to pay my outstanding invoices. I still feel like I failed my community, my family, and myself. However, making that decision lifted a weight I needed off of me, so for that I'm grateful. 

My sister always tells me I'm a big dreamer and visionary. Like it's a good thing. Except I feel the opposite. What good does my big dreams and visions do if I can't follow through and make them a realty?

Pero syempre mahihirapan na din sya makaulit sa akin. Wag nyo na din po ask sana how much kasi baka ma bwiset ako lol.

So ayun she responded and typical kamustahan lang. I kinda stalked her din kasi alam ko may partner din sya eh kaso mukhang it didn't work out well din kasi naka single status sya. Kasi before I was really trying to win her back, around 2020 yun more or less, kaso hndi nga nag push dahil may gusto na syang iba during that time. I walked away. Kasi the usual na pag nag away or nag talo sila ng partner nya mag paparamdam yan sa akin. Mag aaya mag coffee at mag vevent ng mga problems nya sa buhay. Ako naman si Tanga cge kinig and payo padin. try to talk to your partner and all. Problem with me is I am always available for her. IRDK why but whenever she ask for a favor hindi ako maka hindi sa kanya. (balik na muna tayo sa present happenings masyado na ata akong na side tracked).

So our comms got rekindled. From the typical good morning, good night sms or call and how was your day been. Eventually nag vivideo call pa kami while she is at work and I am working with my GY side hustle job. Tamang usap and kinig lang while working which was our thing way way back pa when we are couples. Araw araw vid call walang mintis. Nag kaka ayaan din ng Coffee and catch up pero hndi mag tugma ang schedules namin since I work a regular day job + GY side hustle at home with weekend RD. GY naman yung ex ko and she has a weekday RD.

Then the big thing happened. She was rushed to the Hospital and found out na may injury sya sa spine. She got into an accident the prior year na hindi nya pina check up. So ayun, it got escalated and sa sobrang pain nya she got admitted sa Hospital. From here na cguro nag start yung unconditional love ko ulit sa kanya. Yung supposed coffee catch up namin naging pag aalaga sa Hospital eh, which I really dont mind kasi graduate ako ng BSN. Anyhow, our very 1st meeting, grbe hindi ko alam yung mararamdamdaman ko. When I saw her sa hospital bed nahabag ako, pero napaiyak tlga ako when I accompanied her mag CR. She really cant walk without support and has involuntary body movement. She even cant feel her lower extremities. Grabe tlga. Hindi ako nakapag stay sa hospital on this day kasi I have work the day after so I told her na lang na if ever she needs me or walang mag babantay sa kanya is to just reach out to me. But when I was home na ewan ko pero hndi ko tlga napigilan yung iyak ko, as in hagulgol habang nag shower. So ayun nga. Halos 1 month din sya sa Hospital. From time to time andun ako specially if pag walang nag babantay sa kanya. My friends are asking me the WHY question? Yeah, okay lang naman daw mag visit pero para mag bantay? Walang Relatives? Walang Friends bukod sa akin? Most of them are saying na over naman yung pag aalaga and pag babantay ko. Lalo na yung nalaman namin na potentially mag Surgery sya. I am making myself too available na hindi ko naman daw tlga task. Wala ehh dito ko napatunayan tlga the things you do for love unconditionally. I also saw her kid the last few days na naka admit sya sa hospital. Her kid I took care and considered my own when we were both together. I thought may galit sya sa akin for leaving them before pero to my surprise she recalled me. akala nya nga daw at 1st ako yung recent ex ng mom nya. Tamang kwento and kulitan kaming tatlo dun. Which I kinda felt the same feeling when we were a family back then...

So ayun, nakalabas na sa Hosp for rest and check muna if the medications will work. She asked if masundo ko sya with her mom and ihatid sa apartment nya. I accepted syempre. I help out din with the bills sa hosp. No offense ha pero kasi may mga ibang charges na unnecessary. So from there naihatid ko na sya sa apartment nya. Assisted her mom and her. Saw her kid again. Also assisted sa sickness benefits nya sa company nya.

As day goes by, pag kailangan nya ako I go there. I did the laundry pa nga kasi natambakan sila and nahihiya sya sa isang friend nya so I told her I can do it naman. Nagagalit pa nga ako kasi she is really trying to help pdin. Kaso di pde. Ramdam ko yung self pity nya, yung depression nya din kasi even the basic stuff she cant do. Sabi ko nga focus muna din sya sa recovery nya and let me help sa tulong na kaya kong gawin. Her kid also opens up sa akin. About her mom, feeling nung bata wala syang ginagawang tama. grabe din kasi sya pagalitan ng mom nya. Sabi ko na lang to understand her mom kasi nga may current condition. She's very thankful naman daw and she appreciates all the help I am providing. Pero yung isang common friend namin nag aask, of all people bkt hindi daw ako ma appreciation post. Sa loob loob ko naman not necessary din naman kasi. Pero got me thinking as well. Of all na nag support, tumulong ako lang yung walang appreciation post. Halos lahat ng bumisita at tumulong sa kanya on the spot may appreciation post eh.

A few weeks back, she asked for a favor for her kid. graduating kasi and medyo need mag habol ng mga activities from 1st grading till 4th grading period. So I helped padin as usual, para sa anak nya din naman and parang anak ko na din naman. Her kid kinda looks up to me. Sabi nya nga ako yung Father figure na hinahanap nya. Kasi his dad cant even help or support her. Galit yun bata sa Dad nya and somewhat galit din sa mom nya. Yung mom nya kasi is strict tlga which I understand since babae anak nya. Somewhat I overstep din ata sa boundaries kasi I kinda asked her if natutukan nya ba tlga yung kid nya. Diba kasi pag kuhanan ng card usually nag sasabi naman yung mga teacher or adviser sa school. Nasabihan na kasi na tutukan pero I understand, busy sya sa work and she is providing for her kid. Ayun, nasabihan nya ako na wag daw ako makielam. All I want is to help. After this incident hndi na sya nag rerespond sa akin. I guess I really overstep din. Or invasive masyado.

After this me and her mom visited them again. So I bought milktea as pasalubong for her kiddo. Aba'y nagalit sa akin kasi grounded daw yung anak nya. Masama ba mag dala ng pasalubong for her kid? Pinamimihasa ko daw anak nya. For me if grounded yung bata dapat may isang babalance kasi yung anak nya ang thinking na nya is wala na syang ginagawang tama sa mata ng mom nya. Lahat mali. Nag paparinig pa sya while we are all having dinner. Ewan ko ba if I deserve that. Maybe, pero I just want to help lang din naman. Then nag play kami ng kid nya ng NSW ko eh ang ingay namin while playing, nagalit yung ex ko pero kasi nga dis-oras na din ng gabi. After that, her kid asked me, why do I still like her mom even if napaka toxic nya. Ang sagot ko lang is because of love. Not sure if she heard it kasi sakto yung pag labas nya.

As of now, same pa din, no reply pdin. I really dont know what to do after. Should I stay? Should I leave her be? I know it will be up to me kasi choice ko pa din naman in the end. Sorry for the long post. bigat na din kasi sa dibdib eh.",3,1740668922.0,makeshiftpodcast,0,1.0,False

I have always had  IBS and generalized anxiety that sometimes manifests as nausea. For years I have done my best to chalk up every symptoms to anxiety and tell myself it's not real, but things have gotten worse in unprecedented ways recently. Back in July I stopped tolerating fatty foods and was misdiagnosed with gallstones, which turned out to actually be biliary dyskinesia. When I started my low-fat diet my epigastric pain got even worse and I developed a persistent feeling of heaviness in my stomach, like I ate rocks. I lost 20 pounds and was barely eating by the time my chronically inflamed gallbladder was removed on 9/30, and my joints had started to ache.
 My endoscopy showed no damage but mild chronic gastritis and elevated IgA in my small intestine. The GI who did the scope said he maybe saw something near the pyloric valve if anything but did not elaborate or seem concerned. H. Pylori, celiac, sibo and fructose intolerance were all negative. So were tests for autoimmune diseases, though I do have reactivating EBV and occasional outbreaks of guttate psoriasis.
 Right after this I also started having sudden and severe UTIs that made me pee blood about once a month. I took an ungodly amount of antibiotics and had long stretches of nausea that would last the whole first part of the day. I also developed heartburn worse than both of my pregnancies, which was the only other time I had consistent heartburn in my life. I took a short course of PPIs which helped a bit with pain and burning but slowed my stomach emptying and made me way more nauseous and constipated. As much as heartburn sucks I do prefer it to debilitating nausea. 
As far as lifestyle factors go, I never had a lot of NSAIDS or more than one or two servings of anything mildly caffeinated. I only ever had small  amounts of spicy food. I'm not the fittest person but I try and run a couple times a week and regularly lift a 40 and 24 lb. kid. I know the body breaks down as we age but I'm 28, exhausted, and have to eat an increasingly restricted diet. I had half a cup of decaf coffee yesterday and felt like my chest was on fire for hours, even after pepcid.

To come shortly is a custom made wood coffee table. I want to get the scale right. The wicker one is too small and not really meant for this space but I only have so much $$ to spend at a time 😊 

The rule of thumb for coffee table width is usually 2/3 the width of your couch, however I’m thinking it should be 2/3rd the width of the sideboard with the TV on it since that is the piece of furniture that is in the same orientation with it, and what the coffee table is in relation to. 

We always sit in the armchair recliners. Guests use the couch, and I’ll be putting 2 side tables on either side of the couch. So again, I feel the coffee table should be the same orientation as the TV stand. 

Thoughts? I may be overthinking lol!

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

**1. Biophilic Design Elements**

**The Rise of Nature-Inspired Decor**

Biophilic design, a principle that emphasizes the human-nature connection, continues to dominate home decor trends in 2025. According to a report by the World Green Building Council, spaces infused with natural elements have been shown to reduce stress and improve mood, leading to increased productivity and well-being.

**How to Incorporate Biophilic Accessories**

Homeowners are leaning towards accessories such as:

* **Living Walls and Vertical Gardens**: These installations not only purify indoor air but also introduce vibrant greenery to interiors. A study published in the journal ""Health Environments Research & Design"" found that homes with plants can lower stress levels by up to 60%.
* **Natural Materials**: Accessories made from sustainable materials like bamboo, cork, and reclaimed wood are highly sought after. The global bamboo market is projected to reach $98 billion by 2025, driven by its versatility and eco-friendliness.
* **Nature Prints and Textiles**: Soft furnishings that feature botanical patterns or earthy tones have gained popularity, creating a soothing atmosphere in living spaces.

**2. Multi-Functional Furniture**

**Maximizing Space with Style**

As urban living spaces become more compact, the need for functional decor is greater than ever. Multi-functional furniture items that serve dual purposes are trending in 2025, appealing to both aesthetic desires and practical needs.

**Popular Multi-Functional Accessories**

* **Convertible Tables**: Coffee tables that can extend into dining tables are becoming common. These pieces reflect the rise in remote work, offering versatility for both work and play.
* **Foldable Wall Desks**: With more people working from home, foldable desks allow for the seamless transformation of a space from a cozy living area to a productive workspace. Research from IBM indicates that 70% of employees prefer working from home, emphasizing the need for flexible home environments.

**3. Statement Lighting**

**Lighting as a Decor Focal Point**

Gone are the days of understated light fixtures. In 2025, statement lighting is playing a crucial role in home decor, serving not just a functional purpose but also acting as striking decorative elements.

**Trending Lighting Accessories**

* **Artistic Pendant Lights**: Fixtures with unique designs, such as sculptural or geometric shapes, are increasingly used to create conversation starters in dining rooms and living spaces. The global decorative lighting market is projected to reach $200 billion by 2026, with statement pieces leading the charge.

* **Layered Lighting Designs**: Homeowners are layering ambient, task, and accent lights for maximum effect, enhancing the mood of a room while providing functionality.

**4. Sustainable Decor Accessories**

**Eco-Conscious Choices in Home Design**

Sustainability is not just a trend; it’s a movement that has reshaped consumer purchasing behavior. Home decor in 2025 heavily emphasizes eco-friendliness, prompting homeowners to seek accessories that have minimal environmental impact.

**Notable Sustainable Accessories**

* **Energy-Efficient Decor**: Products that are designed to minimize resource consumption, such as low-flow faucets and LED fixtures, are gaining favor among eco-conscious consumers.

**5. Personalization and Custom Pieces**

**Unique Decor Solutions**

In 2025, consumers are increasingly seeking decor that reflects their personal style and story, leading to a rise in custom-made and personalized accessories. Modern technology has made it easier than ever for consumers to find or create unique pieces that resonate with them.

**Personalization Trends**

* **Personalized Textiles**: Items such as monogrammed pillows or custom-printed throws are being embraced as ways to infuse personal identity into home spaces.
* **3D-Printed Decor**: The application of 3D printing technology allows individuals to create unique decor items tailored to their preferences, ranging from intricate sculptures to bespoke furniture.

**The Future of Smart Homes**

With the ongoing advancement of smart home technology, decor is moving beyond traditional realms. In 2025, tech-integrated decor accessories are shaping how we interact with our living spaces.

* **Health Monitoring Devices**: Innovative accessories that monitor indoor air quality and humidity levels are crucial, especially in spaces where people spend significant time. According to the World Health Organization, indoor air pollution contributes to 3.8 million premature deaths annually, driving demand for better air quality solutions.

**7. Vintage and Antique Revival**

**Nostalgia Meets Modern Design**

The trend of incorporating vintage and antique pieces into modern decor continues to thrive in 2025. This blend of old and new not only adds character but also supports the sustainable cycle of reusing and repurposing.

I know that some of us have crazy lives outside of work, from school to toxic relationships (family or romantic) to money troubles and everything else we struggle with. Personally, I have a substantial amount of free time now that NK has started school (half-days). However, I still work as a house manager, grocery shopping, tidying NK's room, cleaning and organizing, etc. Sometimes my job can be lonely.

Personally, I was in a toxic relationship for 3 years and was right in the midst of it when I started with this family. Since then I have moved on, but there have been only a few instances where ex bf has contacted me, and it has ruined my day. Days where I have had panic attacks and cried. Days where I have had issues within my family that stress me. Days where I am struggling in school. I have borderline personality disorder. Every day, I am trying my best to practice healthy coping skills and habits, and I have grown a lot in the past 2 years I have been with them.

Today, I had one of my bad days. I won't call it a bad day, though, since it's only 10 a.m. I just had a bad morning. I cried on the way back from dropping NK off at school. I already had no makeup on, so I felt blah. I stopped by the store for MB and grabbed coffee for myself and DB.

When I got back to work, MB met me in the hallway. I smiled and told her about NK's morning. Everything seemed fine. I think I know that I am liked and appreciated at my job. If you or someone you know struggles with BPD, you know how hard it is to feel liked by anyone at all sometimes.

I have my things. Sometimes, I'm a little late, but I'm doing better. As I said, I have really grown so much as a person in the time I've been with this family.

Do you think MB can tell I'm struggling? I know that with BPD my idea/perspective of how people see me is so screwed. I just want to appear like I am strong and good at my job. I feel like I am liked and appreciated. I love my job.

We used a company with a lot of recommendations from friends and great reviews on Google, nextdoor, etc. The system works great, but we immediately noticed the living room lights would flicker the whole time it was running. They're LEDs, and other LEDs in the house also flicker. What's more annoying is the clock on our coffee maker speeds up when it's on. If it's a really cold day the clock will be an hour fast the next day, but if it's warmer it may only be a few minutes fast. We replaced the coffee maker four times before realizing it correlated with the heat pump. 

I've been reading posts about bad neutrals that got me worried, but I'm not sure that's what's happening here. There are no sparks, noises, or smells coming from our breaker box. We called the installers several times and they came out twice to check it out and said it's (paraphrasing from memory) dirty power caused by the electrical in our house, that just wasn't noticeable until the new heating system was installed. They said our only options were to replace our electrical system or get a whole house power noise dampening system installed. 

I do know the heating system is on a dedicated breaker - they showed me. Any ideas if their expansion makes sense? I just don't want my house to burn down, but wouldn't mind if I didn't have to reprogram the coffee maker everyday.",1,1740667537.0,AskElectricians,1,0.67,False

1izhd0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1izhd0u/taptopay_fraud_bank_says_authorization_allows_for/,Tap-to-pay fraud: Bank says authorization allows for any amount charged to account,"Context: 
Recently, my wife was victim to contactless payment fraud. The fraudsters convinced my wife to donate financially to a charity, she agreed to pay $25, they typed in 25 into a payment processor and showed her, she tapped to pay, but somehow they changed the amount, charged thousands, and then fled.

We called the credit union (CU) within 5 minutes to report the fraud. They said since you authorized the payment, the amount charged is not considered fraud, and there's nothing we will do. I argued that we authorized $25, not thousands.  

The definition of authorization seems to be key to determining if the credit union is legally required to assist. I have read the electronic funds transfer agreement (EFTA), but it appears to not directly address a situation where a transaction was authorized but the part of the amount was unauthorized. 

Questions:
1. Does anyone know of resources that help clarify the definition of authorized/unathorized? The EFTA doesn't seem clear for this situation. 
2. Common sense tells me that ""amount"" is or should be a part of authorization. If you authorize a clerk to charge you $10 for a coffee and they charge $1000, can the CU really say ""to bad, you authorized it"".

1izhcxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1izhcxf/anathematized/,Anathematized,"Awe is a powerful feeling. For something to be so grand as to inspire respect, devotion and envy is a rarity in the galaxy. On such a short list, the Flarian Royal armada was at the very top. No other species could rival the might of their military. Despite being known on the galactic scene as kind and benevolent rulers of one of the biggest Empires to ever exist, their methods of expansion were anything but biophilic. They had a big stick and were not opposed to using it. 

\*\*\*

“Captain, we will be approaching the Zeta sector in 1 minute.” Said the navigator. 

The captain, an imposing Flarian female seated in her command chair, simply nodded without so much a word. 

As the ship exited hyperspace, the captain rose from her seat. 

“Search the database for any active outposts. We are in dire need of supplies.” 

“Ma’am, this territory is outside Flarian jurisdiction. All planets in this sector are under human rule. And considering their standing with the Empire, I doubt they will willingly offer their supplies.” Orvina responded, looking over at the captain. 

“We do not require their willingness, Vice Captain.” Nubela replied in a cold tone, her lips curling into a barely visible smirk. 

“We are thousands of light years away from the heart of human controlled space. Even if we weren’t, those cowards would never dare fire a single shot at a Flarian Destroyer class ship.”

“The scanners have detected an outpost, Captain.” The navigator spoke while turning his head towards Nubela. 

“We will be within communication range with the outpost in 10 seconds.”

The ship began slowing down, stopping fully just before the lower atmosphere of the rocky moon. Captain Nubela approached the main panel, looking through the blast proof glass down at the yellow surface where the colony was. 

“Hail them.” She ordered, adjusting her uniform a tad. 

Within seconds a screen appeared, stretched across one of the glass panels. Nubela raised an eyebrow at the sight of a withered old face of a human woman looking back at her.

“Greetings. I am captain Nubela Argrath of the Royal Flarian Destroyer “Solar Echo”. Who am I speaking to?” 

The old woman simply looked at Nubela for a moment, a look that stirred something in the captain. There was no fear, worry or surprise on the human’s face. Just a look of tiredness, as if the Flarians were nothing more than unwelcome chore after a particularly long and gruelling workday. 

“Well?!” Hissed the Captain, her two long and bony tails smacking the ship floor in annoyance. 

“Apologies. The comms system is quite old. Takes a bit to load the feed.” Spoke the woman on the other side, slowly fiddling with the keyboard. 

“Ah, there we go. Hello.”

“Hello.” Grumbled Nubela, before repeating her question.

“Who. Might I. Be speaking. To?”

The human cleared her throat, getting ready to answer. She looked so old that Nubela half expected clouds of dust to come out of her mouth. That thought brought the smirk back on her face for a brief moment. 

“I am Tomyris, the Head of the Kalibash mining colony. To what do we owe this pleasant surprise?” 

“We are in dire need of supplies and request that you allow us to descend on the surface and acquire some from your settlement.” Replied the captain. 

“I am afraid that would not be possible, Captain. You see, Kalibash is not a part of the major supply routes. Most of our supplies are from the crops we grow ourselves.” Tomyris replied, shaking her head slowly, as if disappointed that she can’t help the Flarian in their plight. 

“We will judge if that is true or false.” Nubela frowned. 

“A squad and myself will be descending to your colony within the hour. Your words better be true.”

With that the communication was cut, leaving Nubela with the satisfaction of having the final word. She turned on her heels and walked back to her seat. 

“Anchor the vessel here and prepare a squad for deployment.” 

“Captain.” Vice Captain Orvina spoke up.

“I request to come with you to the moon’s surface.”

The captain shot her a quizzical look. 

“For what reason?”

“I… I have never seen a human ma’am. I’ve only heard stories of them in academy classes.” 

Replied Orvina. 

Nubela scrounged her face up in disgust at the sight of someone being so curious and excited about lower life forms.

“Consider your eyes lucky then. These creatures are nothing to marvel at.”

After a brief pause she sighed and continued.

“But very well, Vice Captain. If you wish to test how well you can hold your lunch, who am I to stop you?” 

“Thank you.” Orvina replied with a smile and returned to her duties. 

\*\*\*

The settlers went about their work, trying their best to ignore the Flarian shuttle that just lander at the entrance to their outpost. Even the farthest-reaching outposts of the Galactic Union knew of the Empire’s warmongering ways. Wherever they appeared, bad news followed. It was for that reason that Vice Captain Orvina was not surprised that the settlers did their best to avoid the soldiers that arrived. 

As hard as she tried, seeing them the same way Captain Nubela did was difficult. They certainly seemed unimposing, that much was true, but what species didn’t when compared to the Flarians? She even found them somewhat endearing. They were like half of a Flarian. One pair of arms, one pair of forward-facing eyes, half the size and height. Both species were mammalian, though humans seemed to lack any form of tail or fur… or claws. Even their jaws lacked any sharp teeth. 

“I guess I can understand why Captain Nubela considers them lower lifeforms. They seem so… soft. More like pets than predators.” Orvina thought to herself. 

The group walked through the outpost, leaving foot prints in the yellowish mud, heading straight to the main building. Halfway there, an old woman walked outside of the facility and leaned against the wall, crossing her arms. Nubela snarled, voicing her displeasure of having to be surrounded by these creatures to the rest of the squad. 

Up close Tomyris seemed even more like a dried-up apple than she did over the communication feed. Her grey hair was short curls that stopped at her shoulders. The uniform she wore fit her loosely. Orvina could bet both her right arms that the Head of the Kalibash colony was the smallest specimen of her species present on the moon. 

“Hi there. How do you like our little piece of Heaven?” Tomyris asked, extending her hand upwards to shake with the Flarian captain. 

“I’d hardly call this paradise.” Nubela replied, looking down on the old human, who’s height barely reached past the captain’s belt. With her smaller arm, Nubela reached down and shook the woman’s hand. 

“Excuse me?” Orvina raised her larger arm above her head to catch the human’s attention. 

“What’s with all the carved tree trinkets?” 

“Oh, those?” Tomyris smiled.

“People here like to carve those little totems and trinkets as a pastime. Some believe it helps the crops grow and the harvest to be more plentiful. Like blessings of a sort.” 

Nubela let out a low growl. 

“You’ve unlocked interstellar travel yet you still cling to such superstitions. Only the weak rely on a mysterious higher power.” 

The old woman simply chuckled, waving the massive Flarian captain off dismissively.

“Oh, pish. It’s a piece of culture. If it helps them feel more at home by making trinkets that remind them of life on Earth, who am I to spoil their fun?”

She looked up at Orvina and winked.

“And if some mysterious higher power likes the woodwork enough to toss us a few potatoes more per harvest, I sure ain’t complaining.” 

The Vice Captain smiled at the woman’s joke. All their flaws aside, the humans definitely had a certain appeal. 

Slowly the old woman turned around and headed inside the main facility, which doubled as her home. She moved slowly, using a wooden cane for support. 

The inside of her home was the standard outpost interior design, however decorated with various colourful knitted cloths, carved trinkets that hung on string and would jingle every time someone opened the door or a draft blew through the room. A mixture of yellows, greens, oranges and browns made the interior very pleasant, a stark contrast to the metallic grey of the Flarian Destroyer vessel. Orvina had a hard time describing the feeling she was getting from the old woman’s living quarters, it all felt uniquely Earthy. 

“Sit. Would you like some tea? I’d offer you coffee, but we’ve run out of that a couple of weeks ago.” Tomyris said, motioning to the table. 

“Pass.” The Flarian captain shut her offer down sharply. 

“Do not try to worm your way out of accepting our request by using hospitality, woman. I’ve told you what we need.”

The human sighed.

“And I have told you we cannot help you. We barely have enough for ourselves. No chance we can supply an entire Destroyer class vessel and have anything left to tie us over until the crops mature.” 

“I. Wasn’t. Asking.” Nubela growled, baring her sharp teeth to the old woman, tails smacking the ground behind the captain, a common show of annoyance and aggression among Flarians. 

“Nan!” A shout came from behind the human, interrupting the captain before she could say another word. 

“Nan!”

“I’m in here, darling.” Tomyris shouted back over her shoulder. 

A human male emerged from one of the rooms. He towered over the elderly woman as he approached her from behind and wrapped his arms around her. The Flarians were slightly taken aback by how strange he was dressed. His uniform, a standard yellow and black colonial attire, was decorated by an assortment of items, ranging from feather and small animal bones to carved wooden trinkets. A long coat was draped over his shoulders, no less decorated than his uniform. Wooden chimes hung from it, jangling as he walked. The unusual appearance was tied together by a Grumlag skull he wore on his bald head, its antlers rising upwards. 

“Who’s that?” Orvina couldn’t help but ask. 

The male looked at her, his face dirty and beard caked in mud. Something was off about him. He was an adult by the looks of it. The uniform hugged his body tightly, revealing strong muscles beneath. But his eyes were dull and the look he gave the Flarians was filled with childlike curiosity. 

“What did I tell you about wearing than thing on your head?” Tomyris sighed, taking the skull of her grandson’s head with one hand and giving the back of his head a light smack with the other. 

“Sorry, Nan.” He replied, looking down at his feet shamefully. 

“The boys and I were just playing Beast and-.”

The old woman sighed, putting the Grumlag skull on the table next to her. 

“Alright, alright. Go wash up, it’s time for lunch and you’re all muddy.” 

The man just nodded and walked towards another door, sneaking glances over his shoulder at the aliens in his living room. 

“What are you looking at, dullard?” One of the soldiers hissed, causing the human to quickly look away. 

“I apologize for my grandson.” Tomyris spoke with a sad look on her face.

“He is a good boy, just… not all there.”

The Flarian captain opened her mouth to speak but the Vice Captain cut her off again, unable to contain her curiosity. 

“How old is he?” 

“Twenty-eight. Lost his parents in a mining accident when he was four. With no next of kin, I’ve been taking care of him ever since.” The Head of the colony replied. 

“Poor soul.” Orvina thought to herself, knowing words of pity should never be spoken in Nubela’s presence. 

Such specimens would never survive to adulthood in Flarian society. Defects of the mind were no less frowned upon than defects of the body. Unlike Orvina, the captain felt herself becoming more disgusted with every minute she spent on Kalibash, surrounded by inferiority on all sides. 

“Ugh. Where were we?” Nubela spoke. 

“The supplies.” Tomyris answered. The two locked eyes and the Flarian captain already knew that the woman did not change her answer to their request. 

“How much do you need?” 

“Enough to lasts us to Umlaut sector.” 

“Impossible. We can provide you with enough to last you to the next outpost in Zeta sector.”

Nubela frowned, taking an intimidating step towards the human. 

“We are at war. On a journey of conquest for the glory of the Flarian Empire. You think I have the time to hop from outpost to outpost like I’m going grocery shopping?”

The elderly woman stood her ground, defiance burning in her eyes as she stared the captain down, despite the obvious difference in height. 

“I told you. We barely have enough for ourselves. I will NOT risk the lives of this community to feed your soldiers or fuel your battles.” 

Her anger was reaching a boiling point, Nubela could hardly contain the desire to tear the human limb from wrinkled limb. She placed her huge hand on the old woman’s head. 

“I’ve seen your community and came to a conclusion of my own. You do not have a shortage of food; you have a surplus of useless bellies to feed. Perhaps we should help you achieve more efficient numbers. Feeding the elderly and feeble minded, what a waste of supplies.”

“Captain.” Orvina grabbed her captain by the bicep, feeling Nubela’s muscles softly flex as she prepared to begin rearrangement of the colony, starting with the head of the settlements leader. 

“Leave Nan alone, Beast.” Came from the captain’s left side. 

Tomyri’s grandson had returned, appearing next to his grandmother in a flash, knocking the chairs over in his dash from the bathroom to the centre of the living room, fist raised. 

“Tarnuk, NO!” The elderly woman yelled, but it was too late. 

The smirk on Nubela’s face was erased in a fraction a second, as the man’s right fist connected full force with the left side of her face. Even though he was punching over his shoulder, the sound of the impact caught the Flarians by surprise. 

“Fuck, the idiot put his entire bodyweight into that swing.” Nubela thought as her head whipped to the right. 

The Vice Captain stared in absolute shock, along with the rest of their squad, as the captain lost her balance and took a single step back to regain it. A single step. She never thought anything except another Flarian could cause the war forged Nubela Argrath to stagger on her feet. 

Just as fast as she was hit, Nubela clenched the larger of her two right fists and swung back on the human. He raised both arms to block the impact. The Flarian held nothing back, putting all the frustration that had accumulated since they arrived on Kalibash into a single punch. 

The man staggered, taking two steps back to regain his balance. 

Orvina could see the surprise briefly flash across the captain’s face when the colony leader’s grandson didn’t move back more than two steps. Nubela straightened her posture, letting her arms drop to her side. She huffed, exhaling all the air from her lungs before taking a long inhale. This brief altercation seemed to help vent her frustration a bit. 

“You’d made a great soldier if you weren’t a mentally stunted animal.” She said to Tarnuk, who was still staring daggers at her. 

At that moment, the rest of the squad snapped back to reality, the realization that their captain was just decked across her face finally setting in. They quickly approached the human, ready to end him for that transgression, when Tomyris put herself in their path. 

“Enough!” the old woman said, looking over at the captain. 

“Take what you want and fuck off. The sooner we see the end of you, the better.” 

Nubela smirked triumphantly, turning on her heels and heading for the door, motioning her squad to follow. The Vice Captain was the last to follow, watching as the human went from a courageous man defending his grandmother to a bawling boy in an instant. 

“Grannyyy! I was so scared.” Tarnuk hugged Tomyris as she comforted him. 

Orvina felt strangely guilty. These people weren’t their enemies, they weren’t even allied with the foe they were sailing across the stars to fight. 

“I…” At the same time, she felt strangely speechless. They just robbed these people, left them to die. What can she say to soothe the unfamiliar feeling tying her guts into a knot? 

“What game were you playing with your friends?” She finally found her voice, taking a step closer to the pair and bending over slightly to meet the man at eye level. 

Tarnuk looked at her, wiping the tears from his face with his sleeve.

“Beast and Farmers.” He replied. 

“Oh, and how do you play that?” 

Almost like a switch was flipped, the man’s demeanour changed from being sad to being excited to talk about his favourite game.

“Well. Whoever wears the Grumlag skull is the Beast, the rest are the Farmers. The Farmers have to hide and run from the Beast. Whoever is touched first by the Beast, has to put on the skull and then he is the beast and has to continue searching for the others.” 

“Sounds fun. And it ends when there are no more players who the Beast can give the skull to?” Orvina asked, not being able to help smiling. 

“Uh-huh. Then the Beast eats itself and the game starts again. Well, if Nan doesn’t call me to eat lunch.” He nodded. 

A loud beep interrupted her next question. She straightened up and sighed, turning her attention to Tomyris, who looked at her with absolute disdain. 

“Duty calls. For what it’s worth, I’m sorry. I hope you guys can somehow manage.” 

The words felt hollow, bringing no satisfaction. They just condemned this outpost to die of starvation. No apology or well-wishing could mediate that.

I reconnected with a guy friend after years—we were never close before, just acquaintances. We found out we lived in the same city, so we started hanging out, mostly in a group setting with his friends, who are all great people. Over time, I became a regular part of the group, and he seemed happy about it.

We had several sleepovers after nights out, always in a group setting. At first, we’d sleep on couches or in separate spaces. Later, we started sharing a bed, but nothing ever happened—we’d turn opposite ways, and there was always respect. One time, I got really drunk and accidentally threw up on his bed and even on him. He didn’t say a word, just cleaned up everything and made me coffee in the morning. That moment stuck with me—it made me see him in a different light.

Then one night, after a group dinner, I ended up staying over again. While lying next to him, he put his arm around me, pulled me closer, and gave me a small kiss on my neck. I liked it but got up for a minute, then came back, and we just cuddled the whole night. At one point, he leaned in to kiss me, but I shook my head no, and he didn’t push it. We kept cuddling until morning—no kissing, nothing more. The next day felt a little awkward, but we never talked about it, and things went back to normal.

After that, we kept hanging out, and I ended up sleeping next to him again, but this time he didn’t touch me. Later, we had a minor drunken argument, but we never really addressed it. Then he left for a vacation, and it’s been three months now—we still share memes occasionally, but we’re not in constant contact. I still hang out with his friends, but ever since that cuddling night, I can’t stop replaying the scenario in my head.

I understand he made a move, but how do I know if he actually liked me, or if he just wanted to have sex with me, or is looking only for a friends-with-benefits arrangement? I don’t know if I actually like him or if I’m just attached to the feeling of that night. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t feel the same way—he’s not into dating or relationships, and he’s never given any sign that he wants more. I don’t want to bring it up and ruin the friendship, but I also don’t want to keep thinking about it. It’s been months, and I still miss him and feel happy whenever he’s around.

I feel stuck. Any advice? (And hopefully, no judgment.",2,1740667383.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

1izh9gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1izh9gi/aita_for_refusing_to_do_extra_without_a_raise_and/,AITA for refusing to do extra without a raise and causing my co-workers to get in trouble?,"Just wanting some perspective.

And I guess warning that I am on my phone and have never been good with grammar. I am 33yrs and have no respect for grammar so apologies in advance for the bad grammar. Oh and I live in the USA that's pertinent information.

I had my yearly review last week and it was decided that my manager doesn't have the power to give me a raise as the company only does yearly merit increases. Rate of 2%-3% increase depending on the position. I said it was BS as the cost of living has gone up so much and the minimum wage has increased by $3 in the past year or so with no increase in my wage. In my state I could quit and get another job paying more anywhere.

As such I advised my manager I would no longer be doing extra as I currently do about 3 people's work thanks to constant ""oh such and such can help you"" remarks from my manager. She adamantly denied I was doing so much extra until I listed everything I was doing outside of my scope of duties. Mind you I came in wanting a raise so I had everything ready.

Some examples of things I was doing- running 4 live chats, processing same day emergency requests, acting as a personal secretary to one of the managers I work with, and performing manager duties for another mananger I work with. All things that my manager specifically told people to reach out to me for. She apparently didn't realize how much she'd pawned off onto me - none of it was her duties. She's not actually a bad bad manager just naive and barely keeping up with the team. 

Now 3 team members have been written up so far for failing to do their jobs, my ""team"" is mad at me for getting them in trouble, and I'm drinking my coffee playing games on my phone 2hrs into my shift. 

I WFH and my team is just the department I work in. We have no reason to interact when working as the work doesn't really overlap, plus I haven't had the time to create and foster relationships with them due to the amount of work I was doing. 

The only team mates I actually work with on a daily basis think it's funny and I shouldn't feel bad. My manager and a lead are taking care of the manager who was using me as his secretary this week. I'm sure I'll get him back next week as assisting him is actually part of my job, just not everything he is asking to have done. 

The managers I work with were warned after my review that I would no longer be doing extra for them as I need to be paid more and they 100% agree my manager should be paying me more. They're not happy about it and having been causing problems with the people who were supposed to be doing the work. As they are not fast enough, need too much supervision, lack motivation etc etc. I only know this as they have been calling them out in the live chats for not doing the work and asking to get me back. 

I warned the technicians on Friday that I would no longer be assisting them and they would have to deal with the people actually assigned to help them. They're on the same page as the managers I work with. Not happy but willing to stand by and let it be known they're unhappy and prefer working with me.

1izh8tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1izh8tq/good_grinder_that_works_for_everything_500/,Good grinder that works for everything? [$500]," not currently have an espresso maker but I've wanted one for years. The wife doesn't think we need one. I've read on and off for a long time and am leaning towards trying to talk her into a Bambino Plus and grinder since I see a lot of talk about the grinder making the biggest difference.

I currently have a Simply Good Coffee maker and Oxo grinder from Amazon. I am looking to upgrade my grinder first to spread out the cost but also show her that it will improve things. In my searching around, it seems all of the recommended grinders are single serve.

1izh5bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1izh5bg/could_this_semiautomatic_espresso_machine_from/,Could this semi-automatic espresso machine from Ollygrin be your ultimate coffee companion? A detailed review awaits!,"Owning a dependable espresso machine is a game-changer for coffee lovers. I recently started using the Ollygrin AEK-US-EM1502 espresso machine, and after weeks of brewing my morning cup (or three), I’ve gathered some insights to share. This machine has both impressive features and a few quirks that coffee enthusiasts should know about.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The compact design of this espresso machine caught my eye right away. With its stainless steel exterior, it has a sleek, modern look that fits effortlessly on my countertop. Despite being lightweight at just over 7.5 pounds, it feels sturdy and well-constructed. However, the portafilter is not made of steel, which limits compatibility with magnetic dosing funnels—a small letdown for those who might want to upgrade their brewing tools.

**Brewing Performance**  
This machine boasts a 15-bar pressure system paired with a 1350W motor. Every pull of espresso comes with a rich crema layer, and the consistency has been spot-on. I experimented with different grind sizes and found that dialing in the right grind is key to avoiding over or under-extraction. One limitation I noticed is the inability to control the water output, which makes achieving a traditional espresso ratio more challenging.

[Check Ollygrin AEK-US-EM1502 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dmvtgpbj/)

**Coffee Quality**  
The espresso flavor produced by this machine is bold and aromatic. With the right beans, I’ve managed to brew shots that rival my favorite coffee shop. However, the lack of water adjustment can sometimes result in a slightly diluted taste, especially if you aim for a more concentrated espresso.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**  
The milk frother is an absolute standout for me. It creates rich, creamy foam that’s perfect for cappuccinos and lattes. However, the steam wand's short length can be a bit frustrating. I often find myself steaming small amounts of milk in batches, which isn’t ideal for larger drinks.

**Water Tank & Capacity**  
The 40oz removable water tank is a great feature, especially for someone like me who drinks several cups a day. It’s easy to fill, and the transparent design lets me keep an eye on water levels. However, frequent refillers might prefer a slightly larger tank.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**  
Cleaning this machine has been a breeze. The detachable drip tray and removable components make it simple to maintain. I’ve included it in my weekly routine without any hassle, which is essential for preserving the quality of espresso.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**  
One thing I’ve appreciated is how quickly this machine heats up. It’s ideal for busy mornings when I need that caffeine hit fast. Noise-wise, it’s not the quietest but definitely not too loud to be disruptive.

**Warranty & Support**  
This espresso machine comes with a warranty that offers reasonable peace of mind. While I haven’t needed to contact customer support, I have read mixed reviews about response times. It’s always good to keep this in mind as a potential user.

**Key Benefits**

* Sleek and compact stainless steel design.
* Consistently produces rich crema with a 15-bar pressure system.
* Versatile milk frother for creamy lattes and cappuccinos.
* Easy-to-clean detachable components.

**Areas for Improvement**

* Steam wand is too short, limiting milk steaming capacity.
* No option to adjust water output for espresso customization.
* Portafilter material doesn’t allow for magnetic dosing funnel use.

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing this machine to others like the De'Longhi Dedica or Breville Bambino, the Ollygrin model stands out for its affordability and ease of use. The Breville Bambino, for instance, offers better control over water temperature but comes at a higher price point. Meanwhile, the De'Longhi Dedica has a more professional-grade steam wand but lacks some of the intuitive features of this Ollygrin model.

**Value for Money**  
For its price range, this espresso machine offers excellent value. It’s perfect for anyone who wants a semi-automatic espresso maker without spending a fortune. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of high-end models, it delivers where it counts—good coffee without too much fuss.

""Oh, yeah,"" his son replies, ""we went to see a G-rated movie earlier. A few days ago, I mean.""

The father gets up from the table. The son is still working on his chicken.

He returns with a screwdriver. He turns the lie detector off, unplugs it, turns it over, and unscrews a panel. Inside are two fresh AA batteries, of one of those brands you never see at the store.

He takes them out and slots in two new batteries, then screws the panel back on. He walks toward the garbage can with the preincluded batteries, but changes his mind and puts them in a nearby cupboard.

He returns to the table, turns the lie detector right-side-up, and reaches for the plug. He stops.

He leaves the table. The son is working on his mashed potatos. He comes back with a can of WD-40 and a roll of paper towels. He sprays the base of the arm coming out of the lie detector. He sprays the elbow joint. He wipes it clean.

He puts the WD-40 and the paper towels away. He returns to the table.

He plugs the lie detector back in, and turns it on.

""So, after I ran into Brad Pitt, I saw a giant elephant in the office.""

Silence.

""I asked him, 'what are you doing here, Mr. Elephant?' and he replied 'just making the coffee, pal!'""

The son giggles between bites.

""On the way home, I nearly drove into Jack's giant bean stalk. It was taking up the whole damn freeway, but it's like nobody cared.""

Silence.

""I got out the car, and I shouted up at him as he was climbing, 'You didn't work for that! You didn't earn that! You just cowered and kissed up until someone gave it to you!'""

Silence.

The father puts his head in his hands.

The son is finishing off his green beans.

The father leans forward in his chair and grips the lie detector. ""True is false!""

The son puts down his fork.

When he cuddles her or kisses her.. i almost demand exactly the same energy.. like a child. 

He treats her.. differently. 
They have a ddlg dynamic (not my thing at all but i try not to judge)
So when shes here.. he treats her like a spoiled kid?
Like its always ""can i get you anything princess?""
""Do you want me to order for you?""
""Have you eaten/dranm anything?""

And with me.. i cant even get him to decide what he wants to eat. 
I brought this up to him (i over communicate EVERYTHING)
He says its just the dynamic they have. He loves that im his strong independent wife that doesnt need catered to.. but he enjoys catering to her because thats the role they have with eachother.

But like.. i want pampered too. 

FF to last night. 
Shes staying a few nights.. he tried to give us equal attention. I noticed..
But i still felt like i needed some extra attention when me and him went to bed that night. 
I brought it up to him since he came to bed and didnt do or say much at all..

He apologized and seemed irritated that i brought it up. I told him that i noticed he gave us equal attention that day but i was just feeling a bit insecure and needed more cuddles. 

He cuddled me.. and went to sleep. Both while still carrying that annoyed energy. 

We woke up and hes still being weird. He was all huffy in the morning. Said he didnt sleep well.. came downstairs to make coffee.. and starts aggressively cleaning. (He does this when hes mad)
And keeps giving me short answers. 

I know hes still stressed that i brought it up again but i dont know why. And i dont know a healthier way to address my emotions with him than what i already do.

1izh32s,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1izh32s/could_the_purewell_k8626_gravity_water_filter/,Could the Purewell K8626 Gravity Water Filter System Be Your Best Countertop Filtration Choice? A Detailed Review,"Using the Purewell K8626 Gravity Water Filter System has been a fascinating experience, and I’ve put it to the test daily to see how it measures up. This stainless steel countertop filtration system promises clean, chlorine-free water through its NSF/ANSI-certified 3-stage filtration process. While I’ve found it to be effective overall, there are some things that potential buyers should know before committing.

**Ease of Installation & Use**

Setting up the Purewell K8626 was surprisingly straightforward. The instructions, while not perfectly written in English, were clear enough to guide me through the process. All the necessary components, like the two chambers, spigot, and filters, were included, and assembling them didn’t take more than 20 minutes. I did have to double-check the spigot installation, as a small leak appeared initially, but tightening it resolved the issue quickly. Daily use has been seamless, though maintaining the right water levels in the chambers is crucial to avoid overflow. A transparent gauge or indicator to show the water level would’ve made life easier, but I learned to manage without it.

[Check Purewell K8626 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b09c59m3yy/)

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**

The standout feature of the Purewell K8626 system is its multi-layer filtration technology. The 0.01-micron hollow fiber UF membrane, combined with activated carbon and a silver ion layer, does a commendable job of purifying water. I tested it with tap water that often carries a chlorine odor, and the difference was night and day. The water tastes fresh and clean, perfect for drinking or brewing coffee. However, I noticed a minor issue—some water remains stagnant in the upper chamber, unable to pass through the filter. Though not a dealbreaker, it’s worth noting.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**

One of the reasons I opted for this model is its long-lasting filters. Each of the two carbon filters can handle up to 3,000 gallons of water, giving them a combined lifespan of 6,000 gallons. That’s roughly six months of use for a family of four, depending on water quality. Replacing the filters is straightforward, but it’s critical to prime them correctly before use. I found the priming process a bit awkward, as holding the filters under running water felt like a juggling act. Still, once primed, they worked flawlessly.

**Features**

The Purewell K8626 is packed with practical features, including its durable 304 stainless steel construction. Not only does it look sleek on my countertop, but its robust design ensures longevity. The included stand elevates the lower chamber, making it easy to fill bottles or glasses without tipping the system. Gravity filtration means no electricity is required, which I found particularly useful during a recent camping trip. It’s portable enough to take on the road yet efficient enough for daily home use.

**Capacity & Suitability**

With a 2.25-gallon capacity, the system meets the needs of my household comfortably. I use it to fill a pitcher in the morning, ensuring we have enough clean water for the day. That said, families larger than four might find the capacity somewhat limiting, especially since the filtration process takes time. It’s best suited for small to medium households or as a secondary water source during emergencies.

**Flow Rate & Performance**

The filtration speed is decent but not lightning-fast, clocking in at about 4 gallons per hour. For me, this isn’t a major issue since I refill the upper chamber periodically. However, if you’re someone who wants instant access to large quantities of filtered water, this might feel a bit slow. The spigot works smoothly, but I’d recommend placing the system on a sturdy, level surface to avoid accidental spills.

**Certifications**

Knowing that the Purewell K8626 meets NSF/ANSI 42 and 372 standards gave me peace of mind. The certifications guarantee its ability to reduce chlorine and heavy metals effectively while maintaining structural and material safety. For anyone prioritizing water quality, these certifications are a reassuring indicator.

**Warranty**

The product comes with a one-year warranty, which I found to be a standard offering in this category. While I haven’t needed to use it yet, it’s good to know that support is available if any defects or issues arise.

**Benefits**

* NSF/ANSI-certified filtration ensures clean and safe drinking water.
* Gravity-powered system requires no electricity, making it eco-friendly.
* Stainless steel construction is both durable and stylish.
* Long filter lifespan of up to 6,000 gallons saves on replacements.

**Caveats**

* Initial priming of filters can be cumbersome.
* Some water remains unfiltered in the upper chamber.
* Slow filtration rate may not suit large households.

**Alternative Products**

Comparing the Purewell K8626 to other countertop systems like the Berkey and Aquatru, I found it holds its own in terms of filtration quality. The Berkey offers a larger capacity and faster filtration but comes at a higher price point. Aquatru, on the other hand, requires electricity and has a more complex setup. For those seeking a balance of affordability, portability, and performance, the Purewell K8626 emerges as a solid contender.

**Value for Money**

Considering the features, build quality, and filtration efficiency, the Purewell K8626 offers excellent value for money. While it might lack some of the bells and whistles of pricier options, it delivers clean, great-tasting water without breaking the bank. For anyone tired of buying bottled water or dealing with subpar tap water, this system is a worthwhile investment.

It simplifies my morning routine by having the schedule set but I get better flavor from my Chemex. *So I was wondering where folks start when trying to make adjustments.* My first step is grind size. I use a Breville Smart Grinder Pro between size 40-55, depending on the beans. I always do a 1:16 ratio, but also open to changing that. 

After that point, do you get the most response from number of pulses, water temp, bloom, time between? 

I'm a novice when it comes to coffee making. I've been drinking it for years and I mostly settle into a grind size/water ratio that works for my pour over. I've never attempted messing with all of these other variables. ",2,1740666683.0,FellowProducts,1,0.75,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I used to not be a big coffee guy until my wife introduced me to iced coffee/lattes. We started having coffee every day, and while we did have a coffee machine at home, it didn't really stand up to the coffee you could get at a coffee shop.

But then we got the latte/cappuccino maker. Then we also bought Toranti syrups (exactly what is used at all of our local coffee shops) and can honestly make an iced coffee as good if not better than what we were getting from the shops.

One of the biggest benefits of doing this is that we're not producing as much plastic waste, now. I prefer my coffees cold, but most shops have to give them to you in plastic cups. While we did recycle, it's still pretty ambiguous if it really made a difference.

I will note that we got a Keurig, which does have plastic components that heat up in the brewing process. However, there are frothers out there with minimal plastic and you can find cappuccino kettles that are entirely stainless steel if you want to avoid plastic getting into your coffee. We have all three and depending on how much time we have in the morning before work, we rotate which ones we use.

EDIT: apparently did a misplay getting a Keurig. Because I try to be zero waste, though, I'll either run my current one into the ground and donate it or sell it at some point in the future to get a replacement machine from the comments.",26,1740666585.0,Frugal,57,0.66,False

A question: how do you find the source of the Problem? You find the ""Root"" the ""Why"". Then find the ""How"", how did the problem occur? Write that down make note of why and how. 


An Example: Octan in the Lego Movie they owned Voting Machines, History Books, Coffee, Businesses, they owned surveillance systems etc. A Parent Company can own many companies so follow the money. 

Another example 

Detectives. What do they do? They collect evidence ask what happened. They are tasked with finding the Why and the How and the Who. Why did this take place, how did it take place and who was behind it. Detectives research to find the who. Then they get their guy. 

Follow up Question: If you do not do your research does that make you susceptible to manipulation? Ask yourself this question. | Some Methods to find who owns who: Look up on Brave for example Parent company of T-Mobile. Then look up Parent company of that company then keep going till you find who owns these companies. 

 You can also use Open Secrets they are a fantastic resource. If you struggle to find who the Parent Company is look at terms and conditions. | This is how you Research to find the Root. | How does one research to find History?

I reconnected with a guy friend after years—we were never close before, just acquaintances. We found out we lived in the same city, so we started hanging out, mostly in a group setting with his friends, who are all great people. Over time, I became a regular part of the group, and he seemed happy about it.

We had several sleepovers after nights out, always in a group setting. At first, we’d sleep on couches or in separate spaces. Later, we started sharing a bed, but nothing ever happened—we’d turn opposite ways, and there was always respect. One time, I got really drunk and accidentally threw up on his bed and even on him. He didn’t say a word, just cleaned up everything and made me coffee in the morning. That moment stuck with me—it made me see him in a different light.

Then one night, after a group dinner, I ended up staying over again. While lying next to him, he put his arm around me, pulled me closer, and gave me a small kiss on my neck. I liked it but got up for a minute, then came back, and we just cuddled the whole night. At one point, he leaned in to kiss me, but I shook my head no, and he didn’t push it. We kept cuddling until morning—no kissing, nothing more. The next day felt a little awkward, but we never talked about it, and things went back to normal.

After that, we kept hanging out, and I ended up sleeping next to him again, but this time he didn’t touch me. Later, we had a minor drunken argument, but we never really addressed it. Then he left for a vacation, and it’s been three months now—we still share memes occasionally, but we’re not in constant contact. I still hang out with his friends, but ever since that cuddling night, I can’t stop replaying the scenario in my head.

I don’t know if I actually like him or if I’m just attached to the feeling of that night. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t feel the same way—he’s not into dating or relationships, and he’s never given any sign that he wants more. I don’t want to bring it up and ruin the friendship, but I also don’t want to keep thinking about it. It’s been months, and I still miss him and feel happy whenever he’s around.

I feel stuck. Any advice? (And hopefully, no judgment.)

I understand he made a move, but how do I know if he actually liked me or he just wanted to have sex with me or looking only for fwb ?

(List included!),"So we (My parents, me (42), wife (40) and 2 boys ( 13, 9) are preparing for our 3rd trip to Eleuthera & Spanish wells this coming July/August.

We normally do 5 days in Eleuthera and then 5 days in SW to relax.

This year we are doing 6 on Eleuthera and 6 on SW.

**Beaches we have visited on Eleuthera:**  (mostly from north to south)

Ben Bay Beach--Beautiful Northside beach we visited very briefly on a boat ride

Tay Bay Beach--Right near Preacher's Cave.  First beach we saw and it was a beauty

Whale Point Beach--Not a ton to see but did see a huge red/orange starfish and calm waters

Gaulding Cay Beach--One of our favorites.  Picturesque beach and a nice easy snorkel

Rainbow Bay Beach--Good overall beach.  Worth a visit

Alabaster/Cocodimama/Receiver's Bay Beach--Calm waters, big sandbar, lots of sand dollars

Twin Coves Beach--Unique beach with nice snorkeling on the North side.  Def a favorite

French Leave Beach--Beautiful waves and sand.  One time we went and there were tons of hermit crabs on the rocks.  Cool to see.

Governor's Harbour Beach--Nothing too crazy but its right next to the Queen's Hwy going through town.

Tippy's Beach--Nice Atlantic side beach right next to the restaurant.

Ten Bay Beach--Calm.  Decent snorkeling on South side around the edge

Tarpum Bay Beach--Nice little roadside beach in Tarpum Bay

Deep Creek Beach--Super difficult to get to but glad we made the trip.  Tons of conchs and no one else for miles

**Points of interest:**

Preacher's Cave--Have to visit here if you're going to be in Eleuthera.

Sapphire Blue Hole--Super close to Preacher's cave.  Come see the beautiful water and take a dive in if you're able to climb the rope ladder to get out.

Glass Window Bridge--

Queen's Bath

Ocean Hole

Cape Eleuthera

**Restaurants:**

Daddy Joe's--Good option on near the Glass Window Bridge.  Lots of seating.

Da Corner Cafe--Had a really nice lemon chicken here.  Small place but would go again.

Mel's--We only had a smoothie here but it was quite good.

Pascal's--Really good food.  The road getting there is pretty bad.

1648 Restaurant--Fanciest place we ate on Eleuthera.  Very nice and a nice sunset view.

Da Perk Coffee Shop--Good for breakfast pastries and coffee.

Buccaneer Club--Our go-to GH Dinner option.  Consistently good and kind staff.

Bacchus Fine Foods--Nice options for grabbing stuff and having at the beach

Tippy's--2nd most visited dining option.  Lovely scenery and good food.  Can get crowded if you show up during peak hours.

I'm sure I missed some but that's what I can remember for now.  As you can see, we mostly visit around the GH area as that's where we stay.

Items we are aiming to do on our next trip that we haven't done are:

Lighthouse beach

Alabaster bay beach ramp

Islandia beach

We are going to inquire about snorkeling Devil's backbone while on a boat expedition

Maybe Double Bay beach?

Does anyone have any must-visit spots that we haven't been to yet?

Beaches, snorkeling spots etc.  Open to all suggestions!

I froze. My heart pounded in my chest as I turned to face Jenny’s mom. She stood in the doorway, her expression unreadable.

Jenny, still lounging on her bed, barely glanced up from her phone. ""Hey, Mom. What's up?""

Mrs. Thompson folded her arms. ""I just wanted to check in. I wanted to make sure everything’s okay.""

I swallowed hard, suddenly hyper-aware of the weight of the cage locked around me. Did she know? Could she tell? The thought sent a wave of panic through me.

Jenny finally looked up, giving her mom an easy smile. ""We’re fine. Just working through some… trust exercises.""

Trust exercises?! Was that what she was calling this?

Mrs. Thompson's gaze flicked toward me. ""Well, I’m glad you two are patching things up. It’s important to have clear boundaries in a friendship.""

Something about the way she said that made my stomach twist. Did she know? Or was I just being paranoid?

Before I could figure it out, Jenny spoke up again. ""Don’t worry, Mom. He and I have everything figured out. Right?"" She tilted her head at me, her fingers idly playing with the key on her necklace.

I nodded quickly. ""Y-yeah. Everything’s… figured out.""

Mrs. Thompson gave me a long, appraising look, then finally sighed. ""Alright. Just be sure you two are being honest with each other. That’s the foundation of any healthy relationship.""

With that, she turned and walked away, leaving me alone with Jenny once again.

Jenny smirked, twirling the key between her fingers. ""She’s right, you know. Honesty is important.""

I swallowed. ""Jenny… where’s the spare key?""

Her smirk widened. ""Oh, that? Well… let’s just say you won’t be needing it anytime soon.""

My stomach dropped. ""Jenny… what do you mean by that?""

She giggled, rolling onto her stomach and propping herself up on her elbows. ""I mean exactly what I said. You won’t be needing a spare key because I’ll be taking very good care of the only one that matters."" She dangled the tiny key in front of me, letting it catch the light.

I could barely breathe. ""Jenny, you do have a spare… right?""

Her playful smirk didn’t fade. ""Maybe. Maybe not.""

I shifted uncomfortably. The cage was still new, still foreign on my body, and the thought of not having an emergency escape sent a fresh wave of anxiety through me. ""Jenny, this isn’t funny. What if something happens? What if—""

She cut me off with a wave of her hand. ""Relax, good boy. You’re in safe hands. I know you want this, so stop acting like you don’t.""

My face burned. How did she have this much control over me already? I barely understood how we even got here, yet here I was—locked, vulnerable, completely at her mercy.

She sat up and patted the bed beside her. ""Come sit. We need to set some ground rules.""

I hesitated, then shuffled over, the cage feeling even tighter as I moved. Jenny watched me with amused eyes, as if she knew exactly what I was going through.

""Rule number one,"" she started, ""you do not get to ask me for the key. Not even once. If you do, I’ll make you wait even longer.""

I swallowed. How long was she planning to keep me like this?

""Rule number two,"" she continued, ""you have to be a perfect gentleman around me. No more stealing. No more being weird. If I feel uncomfortable even once, well…"" She jingled the key. ""You really don’t want to know what happens.""

I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.

""Rule number three,"" she leaned in, her voice softer now, ""if you prove yourself, if you show me you can be a good friend, then maybe, just maybe…"" She paused, looking me dead in the eyes. ""I’ll consider letting you out. Someday.""

I felt dizzy. Trapped. Helpless.

And worst of all?

I knew I was going to obey every word she said.

My heart was still racing as I sat next to Jenny, her rules echoing in my head. But before I could even process what I had agreed to, she spoke again.

""Now, onto your next task,"" she said, tilting her head. ""You still owe my mom an apology.""

My stomach clenched. ""Y-you told her?""

Jenny rolled her eyes. ""Maybe, maybe not. She does know that you crossed a line, and she’s the reason I even let you come over today. She wanted to hear you say you’re sorry.""

I swallowed hard. Facing Jenny was one thing—facing her mother while locked in this cage was something else entirely. But I had no choice. Jenny had made that clear.

She nudged me toward the door. ""She’s in the kitchen. Go. Be polite. And mean it.""

I stood on shaky legs, hyper-aware of the small weight between them. I took a deep breath, then forced myself to walk out of the room and down the hall. Every step made me more nervous.

When I entered the kitchen, Mrs. Thompson was standing by the stove, pouring herself a cup of coffee. She glanced up, her eyes meeting mine, and gave me a small, knowing smile.

""Ah, there you are,"" she said, stirring her coffee. ""Jenny said you wanted to talk to me.""

I nodded quickly. ""Y-yeah. I—I just wanted to say I’m sorry.""

She raised an eyebrow. ""For…?""

I felt my face go hot. I hated this. Having to spell it out. Having to say it out loud while she just watched me squirm.

""For… for stealing Jenny’s panties,"" I finally managed to say, my voice barely above a whisper.

Mrs. Thompson took a slow sip of her coffee, watching me over the rim. Then she set the mug down and folded her arms. ""And why did you do it?""

My throat went dry. ""I—I don’t know. It was stupid, and I wasn’t thinking, and—""

""Not good enough,"" she interrupted, shaking her head. ""Try again.""

I bit my lip. I had no choice. Jenny owned me now, and her mom… she wasn’t going to let me get away with anything less than full honesty.

""I did it because… because I was obsessed with her,"" I admitted, my voice barely above a whisper. ""I had a crush, and I wasn’t thinking, and I—""

""—crossed a major boundary,"" Mrs. Thompson finished for me. ""One that could’ve made Jenny feel unsafe in her own home.""

I nodded quickly. ""Yes. And I regret it. I really do.""

She studied me for a moment, then sighed. ""You’re lucky Jenny gave you a second chance. If it were up to me, I’d have kicked you out of her life completely.""

The words hit me hard. But she wasn’t done.

""You don’t just get to apologize and move on,"" she continued. ""You have to prove that you’re better. That you deserve to be in her life. Do you understand?""

I swallowed. ""Yes, ma’am.""

She gave me a long, measuring look. Then, finally, she nodded.

""Good. Then I expect to see you treating Jenny with the respect she deserves. No more crossing lines. No more acting entitled to her time or attention. Got it?""

""Yes, ma’am,"" I repeated, my voice barely steady.

Mrs. Thompson gave me one last look, then picked up her coffee. And that’s when I saw it.

Hanging around her neck, just barely peeking out from beneath the collar of her blouse, was a necklace. And on it… was a key.

I froze.

It was identical to the one Jenny had been wearing.

A cold shiver ran down my spine. My eyes darted away before I could stare too long, but my mind raced. Why does she have a key? Was it just a coincidence? Or… did she know more than she was letting on?

I wanted to ask. Needed to ask. But I couldn’t. Not without making things worse.

Mrs. Thompson took another sip of her coffee, watching me carefully. For a second, I swore she smirked.

""Go back to Jenny,"" she said. ""I’m sure she’s waiting for you.""

I turned on shaky legs, heading back down the hall. The conversation had shaken me to my core—but more than that, I realized something terrifying.

Jenny owned me now. But maybe… just maybe… so did her mother

I walked back down the hall, my mind spinning. The conversation with Mrs. Thompson had left me rattled, but that wasn’t what had me on edge the most. It was that damn key around her neck.

I couldn’t bring it up—not to Jenny, definitely not to her mom. But the thought wouldn’t leave me alone. Was it the same key? Did Jenny give it to her? Or did she… take it?

I pushed the thought away as I reached Jenny’s door. This was her game, and I couldn’t afford to get distracted.

I stepped inside, and Jenny looked up from her phone, a satisfied smirk already on her lips. ""That was quick. Did you apologize properly?""

I nodded. ""Yeah. She, uh… made sure I meant it.""

Jenny giggled. ""Yeah, she can be intense sometimes. But don’t worry, you passed."" She patted the bed beside her again. ""Come sit.""

I hesitated for a second before obeying. As soon as I sat, she shifted closer, eyes locked on me. ""So… how does it feel?""

I swallowed. ""H-how does what feel?""

Jenny rolled her eyes. ""Don’t play dumb."" She reached forward, her fingers grazing the front of my jeans right where the cage was. Not enough to do anything, but enough to make my entire body tense up.

""Oh my god,"" she giggled, pulling her hand back. ""You’re so nervous right now. That’s adorable.""

I didn’t know what to say. My heart was pounding so loud I was sure she could hear it.

Jenny leaned back, still smirking. ""Get used to it. This is your new normal now."" She toyed with the key around her neck, letting it dangle between her fingers. ""At least… if you want to keep being in my life.""

She was testing me. Pushing me. And the worst part? I wanted to see how far she’d go.

I swallowed hard. ""I-I want that. I want to be in your life.""

Jenny beamed. ""Good answer.""

She shifted forward again, closer than before, her voice softer now. ""Then you’re going to be good for me, right? You’re going to listen? Follow the rules?""

I nodded. ""Y-yeah. I will.""

Jenny giggled, reaching out again—this time, just to gently cup my chin. ""That’s what I like to hear. But remember…"" She tapped the key against my chest. ""You’re mine now.""

I barely had time to process those words before she suddenly pulled away, grabbing her phone. ""Anyway! Let’s watch something. I’m in the mood for a movie.""

Just like that, the intensity was gone, like it had never happened. But as I sat beside her, trying to focus on the screen, I knew one thing for sure.

Jenny wasn’t just playing with me.

She was training me. And I was letting her. ",5,1740666122.0,cuck_femdom_tales,3,1.0,False
1izgvop,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfdiscoverycompass/comments/1izgvop/awakening_journey_caught_up_in_exbreakup/,Awakening journey caught up in ex/breakup,"Hello there—

Long story short, I am struggling in my awakening journey because it is intrinsically linked to my ex-gf and the pain of my breakup with her after a 1.5 year relationship.

To explain, I started dating my ex a couple years back, and at that time, I was already starting to deconstruct from a very rigid, dogmatic American Christian upbringing. I knew I had to move on from organized religion, but I wasn't sure what I was looking for, exactly. It turned out that this girl I was dating was already very far along in her journey of awakening, had experience in perceiving 5D, regular conversing with astral entities, spirit guides, etc. She slowly introduced me to this world, taught me how to meditate, and thus, was the catalyst of my spiritual journey.

But, we entered a long-distance period of the relationship, and I did not take it well. I was anxiously-attached, immature, and still not very far along on my path to waking up. I was clingy, overly emotional, and often egocentric and combative. Obviously, she was not perfect and had her roles to play as well, but I can only take responsibility for the ways I was not a very good partner. She eventually dumped me over Christmas, saying that I couldn't be allowed to bring down her vibration and impede her spiritual growth. She even went as so far as to block me on any and all communication channels.

I know that this is something I must accept and grow from—That I am meant to go through this suffering on my path to awakening. But it is difficult to accept what I have lost. I loved her very deeply, and I wish I had matured both spiritually and emotionally sooner so that growth didn't have to come at the cost of my relationship with her.

Eckhart Tolle often talks about how there is no ""past you."" There is only a past reflection of the unconscious state, and all that matters is being present in the eternal now. I recognize this to be true. But I often find myself thinking, when I close my eyes and focus on the present moment, that I wish I could share this ""now"" with her. The small moments that make life beautiful, I wish she was there too.

I know that if I forever rely on her (or anyone else) for my inner peace and joy, I will never have it, because those attachments are fleeting and riddled with complexities. But I also can't deny or suppress the light and warmth her presence brought into my life when she was here.

Also, because she was the one who started me down this path, she is, in a sense ""wrapped up"" in it...It's like how you feel bad going to the restaurant where you went on your first date, so you avoid going there. Or you might throw a certain coffee mug out because it makes you think of them. You try to do things be places that \*don't\* make you think of them, right? Well unfortunately for me, she was so central to the start of this journey for me, that often, me doing anything that has to do with spiritual development whether that be mediating, practicing presence of mind, reading an author like Tolle or Watts—It all calls her to mind. It's kind of ironic, I know.

I am sure there is a meaningful lesson that the Universe is trying to teach me in all this, but it is very difficult and painful. I wonder if anyone else can relate.",1,1740666118.0,selfdiscoverycompass,0,1.0,False

A question: how do you find the source of the Problem? You find the ""Root"" the ""Why"". Then find the ""How"", how did the problem occur? Write that down make note of why and how. 


An Example: Octan in the Lego Movie they owned Voting Machines, History Books, Coffee, Businesses, they owned surveillance systems etc. A Parent Company can own many companies so follow the money. 

Another example 

Detectives. What do they do? They collect evidence ask what happened. They are tasked with finding the Why and the How and the Who. Why did this take place, how did it take place and who was behind it. Detectives research to find the who. Then they get their guy. 

Follow up Question: If you do not do your research does that make you susceptible to manipulation? Ask yourself this question. | Some Methods to find who owns who: Look up on Brave for example Parent company of T-Mobile. Then look up Parent company of that company then keep going till you find who owns these companies. 

 You can also use Open Secrets they are a fantastic resource. If you struggle to find who the Parent Company is look at terms and conditions. | This is how you Research to find the Root. | How does one research to find History? Well what does a Journalist do a good one that is? He asks the opposing side their take. Why do Journalists do this or supposed to? To give each side a voice similar to a court room you have a prosecuter and an attorney. 

 look at the history of the opposing sides then relate it to the history you were taught. Do you see anything that is off? Look for hard evidence like photographs, documents, confessions. Then you hear the whole story 

Yes this is something we learned young is to listen to both sides of arguments to get the full story. If we dont its an echo chamber and you miss out on possible information you didnt consider or know about. This is Critical Lesson. ",1,1740666046.0,u_insightfulEyee,0,1.0,False

1izgt54,https://i.redd.it/6qg2mdggxole1.jpeg,My idea of how Reze will return in Chainsaw Man part 3,"- Start the scene with Reze near the end of the Afghanistan war, during the Soviet Union's invasion.

- The Afghan military is using a chainsaw zombie army to fight against Soviet soldiers.

- Reze sees a chainsaw zombie and says, “Chainsaws again? I’m sick of chainsaws!”

- She then jumps from the plane and transforms into the Bomb Devil to end the war.

- Afterward, Reze returns to the Soviet Union to discuss who will be the next hybrid, as they have just captured the Gas Chamber Devil.

- A child soldier in the hybrid training program loves Reze so much and wishes for them to live a normal life.

- On the night of a speech at the Kremlin in Moscow, everyone in the Soviet Union gathers to hear the biggest performance from the President of the Soviet Union.

- One of the child soldiers, who is also one of Reze's disciples, comes and leads her to the basement under the main stage, saying that an old friend wants to meet her.

- As Reze enters the basement, the light reveals a person she knows.

The boy with blonde hair and shark teeth who hates coffee.

The boy who once made her laugh and whom she fell in love with.

The boy she betrayed and manipulated.

Now he’s not a boy anymore but a man; he has grown his hair out and has a beard.

He says, “Yo, it’s been four years, Reze.”

I was excited to try it, so waiting two weeks for the beans to rest proved difficult. The beans are from Villa Lara, Guaduas, Columbia. It had tasting notes of cherry, chocolate and to be honest I don’t know what the third little photo on the box is of. So if anyone can help that’ll be great.

Overall the cups this coffee produced were enjoyable and I could see this being a daily driver for me. It was well balanced with acidity and sweetness. My first sip had hints of cherry with a lingering after taste of well made chocolate.

I used a 1:15 ratio (20g coffee to 300g water), 4:6 method, and a Hario Switch. 

This was a very well balanced cup and I hope Coffee & Tea Collective keeps this for a long time.

I'm a very beginner but I'm committed, I've started practicing the language on Duolingo and am also listening to podcasts such as Coffee Break Swedish and Simple Swedish. I think that writing letters would help me because it will allow me to slow down and think as I write things out, which helps me internalize things

This is the long shot part lol, I would be most comfortable exchanging with another trans person (I don't care which way) or at least someone else who is lgbt/ neurodivergent in some way. I'd need you to be 18 or older and would really prefer to write someone between the ages of 21 and 35. If you are not like this I might not reach out, and that is not your fault it's just a personal comfort thing 

Some of my interests/hobbies include sewing, drawing, music, cats and baking. I'm currently fixated on learning how to hand sew costume parts. (specifically for fursuits) Media and fandoms I'm interested in include Pokemon, SpongeBob, the furry fandom, and some anime (but not a lot) I really like hearing about the kinds of food and music that people like. I think those are really good ways to learn about a person/ culture.

I am not worried about response times (but would try to respond promptly of course) and would like to work up to snail mail but would prefer talking over DM for a while first until I've established a good comfort level with you

Please feel free to comment or DM :) Tack så mycket!",1,1740665652.0,penpals,0,1.0,False
