February 16th 2025 - We awoke, the air conditioner humming as we prepared for the day. Thank god for the air conditioning because I like it. Me and Sparky discussed how our day was going to go when I heard a noise creeping towards my room. My eyes grew wide and I turned to Sparky and shooed him to my closet. My door opens with a creak and my mom with her tired eyes and fake smiles comes in. “Hey Delilah, what’s new, cockatoo?”. “Mom, you know I’m too old for that nickname” I muttered. She walked to my blowup mattress and gave a confusing look. I quickly said “I slept on it because my bed was uncomfy”. “Ok” she said. “Hey mom look over there” and I pointed to the opposite direction of the closet, while she was turned, I looked towards the closet. I wrinkled my face and put my hand over my lip, signaling to Sparky to PLEASE not talk. Sparky opened the closet and signaled an “Ok” hand sign like this 👌. She turned around and said “Okay, I better be off to Walmart, I got another double shift.” “Ok” I said. She shut my door and I wiped my brow of the sweat it accumulated, that was a close one. 

Plans for the day:

* Do good work
* Drink some milk
* Investigate monster
* Live our best life

I wrote down my to-do list for the day and we quickly both took showers, and headed out for the day. “We have to figure out where their next hideout is” I said to Sparky. Cracked concrete filling our eyes, we walked down the sidewalk and started to question where to go first, the coffee shop is where a lot of people chit-chat and all that. We might be able to overhear something. Walking into the coffee shop the smell of coffee beans and baked goods filled the air. I saw the townspeople of Chipanoga (which is my town in Doors county) going about their daily lives, one guy got some chips from the vending machine and I giggled. “*Huh, what a tool”*.  Most of the conversation was the current exchange rate of milk in our town. Class III and Class IV milk is going up and the mayor hasn’t done anything about it. Our mayor is not well respected. One guy with a green jacket and black hat sat alone, and drank his coffee in silence. I sat down next to him, and Sparky did the same. In silence the guy drank his coffee as I questioned him and broke the silence “Hiya can I ask you a few questions?”. “No.” he growled. “Ok fine” I said and then soon after left. Me and Sparky were getting nowhere and fast, on top of that our tummies were growling. I sat on the damaged and cracked curb while Sparky threw rocks at passing cars. All of a sudden 3 black limos wooshed by us and Sparky looked up in the sky and smiled, he had a lightbulb going over his head. “That's it, Tim Walters,  the mayor!” I agreed with him. I got on my bike and we followed the 3 limos. 

I biked up the hill and to the…The Stinky Sailor? What was the mayor up to now? The stinky sailor was *the* strip club of Chipanoga (Chip-uh-noh-gah). If you were a dude and had some extra cash, you’d get off work and come here in a flash. It has certainly seen better days. The big highway sign no longer admitting its once neon glow. The paint on the walls are now cracked and foolish, the puddles on the floor are now vast and poolish. I urged Sparky to stay in the parking lot while I went and talked to the most hated man of Chipanoga (population 11,708). I entered The Stinky Sailor and already smelled the vile stench beer and booze. I walked to the Bouncer and he urged me to take a hit of his blunt. “C'mon man, it’s good,” He suggested. “No thanks, drugs are bad.” “Quit being a pussy,” he said. “No, really. I am good at sports and would not want to sully my reputation” He quickly put it in my mouth and I accidently inhaled. WTF. He gave me the jolliest rancher in his bag and I thanked him for it and went on my way. It was Blue Raspberry, what a joy. I walked further into the club, the DJ was jumping to the rhythm. The people were all dancing to “Party Rock Anthem” by LMFAO, the cocktail bar was in full swing, the bartender was doing that thing in basketball where he balances his cup on his finger and the strip club goers went wild.  My eyes scanned the room for the mayor. I asked one of the bouncers and they told me he was in the VIP room waiting for his lapdance.

 I barged in the room and he said “Who are you?”. “I am Delilah, I am with the Chipanoga Weekly Newspaper “Fine” he grumbled, “come on in and sit down”. He takes out a bottle of water. He sips. I could tell it wasn’t ideal that a “reporter” found him at a strip club. “Whaddya want from me, my approval ratings are in the toilet” He growled. (It was true, ever since he was elected in 2023, he’s had an average of 20% approval) “All they want is milk, I keep trying to give milk, but I can’t because there’s too many people and too little milk. I spend too much of the budget on milk”. I could tell he was stressed, his hair was a mess, his suit looked like shit. There was no doubt he was in a bad place. The Mayor said “By the way, in Spanish, Mayor means better”. Just then a martini glass started to transform into those fucking babies I saw kill those people down at the river yesterday in the forest. The mutilated looking newborn screamed a terrible screech. It’s skin pores leaking some sort of clear goo. “Mr mayor, get down!” and I got out my secret squirt gun and lined up the shot. Time seemed to slow as I aimed at it. I squinted and cocked the watery weapon. “Burn in hell”. I whispered.  SQUIIRT. It dropped into an ashy puddle and got low on the floor. Water vapor billowed from the barrel of my gun. “Mr. Mayor, meet me at my house at 9:30PM, bring a sleeping bag, I’ll explain everything”. The mayor looked shocked but for his own safety he knew it was safer to go along with this than not, he looked shocked but nodded yes. 

I saw Walters walk into my driveway, sleeping bag in hand. Smiling as I opened the door. He looked at me with a big smile and I shot him a thumbs up. “I told my wife I was having a sleepover at a friend’s house. I think she bought it"" he explained. I shot him a double thumbs up, as he stepped in my house three black cars drove away, his security team knew no boundaries. I motioned him to come inside my humble abode. He looked inside my house and looked in awe, “Wow, you’re so poor”. I frowned, “this is your fault, you spent too much on dairy, now look where I am”. He looked like he wanted to respond but I shhhed him, not wanting to have an argument when the stakes are as high as they are. A loud spring noise came from the kitchen! “Toast’s done!” Sparky cheered,  pounding on the table with a knife and fork in hand. It’s been a while since I got to use my spare toaster from Temu. I whipped out the butter and cinnamon, a treat I enjoyed since I was 8 (I am now 22). We enjoyed the light snack, we talked about the big things and we talked about the little things. Sparky talked about his new name. Walters talked about dairy. I talked about Rover and our relationship, they could tell I was on the verge of tears. They gave me a reassuring pat on the back and a grin to the face. I was whole again.

 I invited them into my bedroom and we got into my green tent in the closet. We all sat down criss-cross applesauce and held hands. We did this to make Sparky feel normal, as this was tradition in the cult. We were about to talk about our game plan. “We can’t let the cultists win” I said. “Yea” says Sparky. Having connections to the underworld and various social services, Walters was able to use his connections to eventually find the hideout, but it would take a couple days, as he could only find the most trustworthy to relay this information. “You can’t tell Chipanoga about this, the town would freak” I said worryingly. “Don’t worry, I won’t, my approval ratings would plummet even bigger now” Tim shakes his head at the thought of a lower approval rating than he already had at this time. With a new game plan and a sleepy head, I went to sleep. Tim was rocking the sleeping bag and Sparky had the air mattress like he did the previous night. I put on the Pewdiepie Amnesia series to have a little amnesia of my own, reliving the good ol days where I didn’t have to worry about creepy creatures. 

I went to sleep and was suddenly awoken by a young man’s voice yelling at me. It was strange, I was…standing? I don’t understand it myself and Tim was standing right alongside me. “Look!” shouted Sparky. “A couple of townspeople with their eyes shut were all going outside and walking around, shortly after they went back to their house. “Sparky what’s going on?”. “I usually go to sleep for around 4 hours, it makes me anxious to sleep any longer than 4 hours”. “I just saw you guys sleepwalk out of your beds, I think…I think they might be able to control you in your sleep”. Sparky said. I furrowed my brow in frustration, things were about to get a whole lot harder.",1,1742357503.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

1jeoqno,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1jeoqno/i_fucking_love_watching_sports/,I fucking love watching sports,"24M, I love watching sports. 

When I was a kid and used to visit my favourite uncle’s (~50M at the time) house, he would always be watching sports in his room with a tea cup in his hand. Not only live matches, even the year old replays. He would always have sports channels playing on his tv. I never used to understand the appeal of that. I used to watch live important matches here and there when I was younger but I never understood why my uncle would watch any kind of sports.

Now that I have grown, I have become like that uncle of mine.

I watch sports all day, every day. I would watch any sports tho. I follow cricket, football, hockey, tennis religiously. I love slow paced sports like cricket as well which I can keep them playing at the background while I do work from home. 

I love fast paced sports like football as well for which I can’t even move my eyes away for a second. 

I love the crowd chants in the stadium, and the commentators speaking about the sports it sounds like music to my ears. There have been times when I would sleep and these matches would keep playing at the background and I feel relaxed while they are playing at the back (for games like cricket and tennis).

No matter how fucked up my life is - If my favourite team, I have one in almost every sport, is playing a game. I would make me a cup of coffee / tea (*I don’t drink alcohol so this is like a sober man’s version of opening a can of beer*) and JUST CHILL. And for those hour or two, my life just feels so relaxed and I feel like everything is fine in my life. 

I have become like that uncle. Sometimes, I am eating my food and I would just play a press conference of the manager of one of my favourite teams and would just listen to that. 16 year old me would say why are you listening to this boring ass interview! haha. 

In future, I would want a wife / girlfriend that at least respects this side of me and let me chill to watch a game for an hour or two every other day. 

My recent ex hated me when I would watch sports. Never understood why! I hope the future girlfriend is cool with it even if she doesn’t love watching sports as much as I do!",1,1742357491.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False
1jeopk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/fearofflying/comments/1jeopk4/successful_world_tour_and_tips/,Successful World Tour - And Tips! :),"I wanted to thank you all on this sub for the encouragement, support, and kindness.

It's been my dream to travel the world, but the fear of flying gave me huge headache.

With your help, I was able to fly the following all in a few months:

SFO -> HKG

HKG -> HAN

HAN -> SGN

SGN -> PNH

SAI -> DMK

DMK -> CNX

CNX -> DMK

DMK -> ICN

ICN -> TAO

TAO -> KMG

KMG -> KTM \*\*\*<this was the hardest!!! We circled for an hour :O but the views of Everest were worth it!

KTM -> SIN

SIN -> AKL

AKL -> HNL

HNL -> NRT

NRT -> SAN

SAN -> SCL

SCL -> PNT

PNT -> SCL

SCL -> SAN

SAN -> SFO

I am beyond grateful for the chance to have visited Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, South Korea, China, Nepal, Singapore, New Zealand, Japan, and Chile, and would have missed out on the most spectacular few months of my life.

I wanted to share some insights for other fellow travelers on what helped me. Before I started this journey, I'd cry a few days before the flight, culminating with an upset tummy and shivers onboard, to exhaustion afterwards. This is what helped me:

1.) Your body relaxes your mind. Not the other way around. I used to feel I had to wrangle in my thoughts, quit thinking about what could go wrong, quit worrying about every weird noise that the airplane made, and THEN my body would relax. For me, it ended up being backwards. I found if I could FIRST be mindful about my symptoms - tightening shoulders, stomach in knots, white knuckling my seat - I could then focus on relaxing my body. That meant relaxing my shoulders, letting my stomach go, letting go of the seat. Yes, even in turbulence. Let go of that seat!!! You scare yourself when your body tenses up like that. Let it go. Relax your body and your mind may believe you that it's safe.

2.) Stay in the present moment. Every moment that you are sitting and breathing is a moment you are not in peril. Use what you can hear, see, smell, touch, taste to your advantage. Hyper fixate on the interesting choices the airplane made in their magazine. Admire the view outside. Smell the coffee as it wafts through the cabin. Listen to a nice song and really think about the lyrics. Taste the biscuits or pretzels or whatever goodies they give you, think about the ingredients. Mindfulness is your friend.

3.) Finally, making a promise to yourself to board every flight and not second guess yourself helps prevent anticipatory anxiety. I missed a vacation in Switzerland many years ago due to my fear of flying, and I I was super depressed about missing it for a long time. I made a pact with myself afterwards, I would not miss a flight no matter how scared I was. It's just a roller coaster and the only thing you have to do is get on. From then on, I never worried about whether I should nope out of a flight or not - I was getting on no matter what. It took stress out of the decision making.

Anyway, best wishes to all the nervous flyers out there - you got this!!! Please feel free to reach out with any comments, questions, concerns, I'm here for you :)",1,1742357377.0,fearofflying,1,1.0,False

here it is: 

I’ve never taken a creative writing class, never enjoyed thinking up a story in any AP English course, never even seen the flow of words and images scramble around in my mind until they resemble something reminiscent of a daydream. So why do I feel such a strong desire to get something down on paper or screen? Something that could maybe be the love-child of my thoughts and feelings or some flowery poetic bullshit like that. Maybe it’s because I’ve decided to stop torturing myself and have finally *indulged* in listening to a romance novel. Still, I’m so neurotic that I had to pick one that aligned with the tastes of the people that I want to be. Emily Henry, I still love you (this is not about you). There is no story in my head, nothing that I consciously want to be told but I still crave *something*. Is this a symptom of me slowly losing my mind? I have nothing to say, but still I feel that maybe one day sometime soon i’ll have an outpouring of creative energy. I’m waiting to find my passion. My mother is a writer, but my mother is crazy. Is there any part of her jumbled mess that would manifest as any sort of talent? Just drivel, drivel, drivel. I’m starving to know if any of this is enticing for other people to read. Yeah, of course. You can get good at most things with practice. But I feel that in order to get to a level beyond basic hobbyist and coffee shop zine distributor, there needs to be a morsel of talent. Just a seed. I’m asking: do I have that seed?

**Okay. It’s most likely the OCD that’s causing me to get caught on this ridiculous carousel of needing and finding and needing again, but I just** ***have*** **to know. Is the crumb there? The morsel? Does this writing have any touch of personal style or voice? Is there anything here that could possibly evolve into something that could be desirable and serve as more than just a wet, hot glob of reducto-think?**",0,1742357223.0,writing,0,0.5,False

My girlfriend is British (29F) and I’m American (32M)

Slow Horses came out before we started dating but we binged all available episodes and watched this last season together

Thankfully, she’s now hooked ☺️

So much so, she was curious about the books! I read her London Rules over the course of about a month. Mostly before bed or at coffee and stuff  

And, her take is one that I see in this sub a lot. “the books are better than the show” ; “it’s not even close”

The real value in Mick Herron’s writing is in his ability to balance detail and intrapersonal thought along gripping and riveting spook stories. He deconstructs the spy world; making his characters as relatable as your favorite barista. He’s a master at living in his characters skin and his writing is so descriptive; it was likely impossible to not adapt his written works to screen. 

If you love the show and aren’t a big reader; you WILL, at the least, enjoy the audiobooks. She’s reading my copy of Joe Country on her own so if you’re trying to get into reading a but more I highly recommend…. 

Binging the show haha > listening to an audiobook > reading a book

She’s not a big reader (she has other gifts/interest) but I started writing this in my head after seeing her whip Joe Country out on the train today. She didn’t even look at me, unconsciously invested in HER book 

All to day - you should read the books, even if you’re not a big reader. You might develop a love for it

**AITA for not taking down an X-Rated book when my ex's gf asked me to?**

**Originally posted to r/AmItheAsshole**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!harassment, stalking, threatening behavior!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/esUII8J7Lr)  **Sept 8, 2022**

Last year, I (24F) wrote an erotic novel to make some money on the side. It ended up picking up traction and makes a fair amount of sales every month. I'm not living off the income, but it helps pay some bills every month while I'm getting my masters. 

A lot of the book was inspired by my boyfriend at the time. He knew I was writing it and it was often a joke between us that he ""had to give me more to write about"". He read the book before I self-published it and gave it his seal of approval - I wouldn't have published it if he'd been uncomfortable. 

The character doesn't resemble him in personality or appearance and there are no hints that would give away who my inspiration was. I wrote under a fake name too, so it's unlikely to be traced back to him at all. 

We broke up six months ago, but we keep in touch. We've been friends for a while, and the split was mutual, so there are no hard feelings. I knew that he had started seeing someone over the summer, and I guess he told her about the book because she approached me at the library yesterday and asked me to take the book down. She said it makes her uncomfortable knowing that people can read details about our sex life. 

I asked her if my ex was uncomfortable with it, and she said he was. I told her I would take it down. That night, I texted my ex and told him I was sorry the book made him uncomfortable and that I would take it down as soon as I could. He had no idea what I was talking about. He said it didn't make him uncomfortable, and that I didn't need to take it down. He cracked some jokes about how he was glad I was still profiting from his hard work. When I told him his new girlfriend had approached me, he said that she did think it was weird, but it wasn't her call. 

Today, I was eating lunch and the girl came up to me again. She started saying that I was disrespectful for going behind her back to talk to her boyfriend - side note, I talk to my ex semi-frequently anyways - and that I was disgusting for ever publishing the book. She also said that it was gross I was involving other people in my exhibitionist kink unwillingly. 

I let her talk for a bit and then told her she was overreacting. I said I did it to make money, not because I derived pleasure from it, and that the book's publication is between me and my ex. It doesn't involve her. 

 She called me a bitch and stormed off. 

I know it's kind of weird to have a book out there with details about me and my ex's sex life, but I don't really want to take it down because it's a good source of income. 

AITA?

**runedued**

>NTA. Her insecurities are not your issue.

**bmorebecc**

>>Exactly this. And if she’s so insecure, why read a book about her bf’s sex life with his ex? 😂.

>“Involving people in my exhibitionist kink unwillingly”

>Seeking erotic novels out and paying for them is hardly unwilling. 

>She’s the one going around her boyfriend’s back in order to get her way.

>NTA.

Edit: 
Hey guys - it's been a doozy of a day. 

First, thank you everyone for the replies. I made the post when I was questioning my sanity over the situation, and your comments brought me back down to earth. 

Some answers to questions: 
I don't know why he told her about that book. Since the post, I've told him it's something I would like to keep between the two of us. I feel like if anyone in my master's program finds out, I'll be taken much less seriously. 

If you're interested in self publishing, try Amazon and do some reading about keywords. There are tons of blogs on it. 

I won't be giving out the name of the book, as it gets very, very kinky and this post has gotten a lot of views. I fear someone finding the story on other websites (on the off chance I made it - hi TikTok) and making the connection, especially considering I don't know who else my ex has told. 

I have no idea how this girl keeps finding me. I'm on campus every time, so I assume it's just by chance, as she's in a master's program as well. 

**Final Update posted Sept 11, 2022 (3 days later)/Same Post**

An update: 
Shortly after I made the post, I got on Amazon to look at my book and noticed I'd gotten an influx of bad reviews. I checked the reviews and found some buzz words that my ex's gf had used. Thankfully, I'm fairly certain I can get these removed. I'm also concerned because Amazon takes a few days to process reviews, so I don't know how many more of these will be coming.

I decided to call my ex and let him know what was happening. I told him about his gf confronting me, calling me a bitch, how she initially lied to me about his feelings, and now the bad reviews. He was floored. I don't think he had seen that side of her personality. 

My ex is an all around great guy and he was very apologetic. He said he would talk to her about it. He said he didn't tell her the name of the book, but he did have it on his Kindle, so she must have snooped and found it.

This morning, I was getting a coffee in the student center, and the girl walked up to me and started screaming at me. Apparently she and my ex broke up and she blamed it on me. 

I didn't know what to do, so I just took off walking to my car. She started calling me a slut and a whore, and a pervert (nothing in the book is that bad, especially if you like erotica already). She followed me out of the building, but thankfully stopped chasing me once I hit the parking lot.

I was shaking and I called my ex again. He ended up coming to sit in my car with me until I calmed down. We considered calling the campus police, but I didn't want to explain it to them, so he walked me back inside. 

She was there, but when she saw my ex with me, she didn't yell. She burst in to tears and said she knew he was cheating. He told her to leave me alone, he hadn't cheated (factual), and that he broke up with her because she was too jealous and immature.

She seemed flumexed and left. Ex bought me a coffee and we discussed filing a police report if she approaches me again. 

So, yeah. That's pretty much it, I hope. Definitely feels like sequel material, although I'm a bit lacking in the physical inspiration part these days.

1jeoj9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsHelp/comments/1jeoj9r/do_ltheanine_side_effects_go_away/,Do L-Theanine side effects go away?,"I've been googling and searching Reddit furiously, but I've decided to throw in the towel and make a post myself. I'm going to overshare, but this feels like the place to do it. 

I've had really bad sleep my whole life due to PTSD, anxiety, ADHD, and poor sleep hygiene. I've recently been cracking down on diet, exercise, and self-care. I really want to improve myself and my mental health. I will be consulting my doctor next week about L-Theanine, but I'm too impatient, so I figured I'd check in here first. I also take Wellbutrin and Buspar. 

I took 100mg of L-theanine (half of a tablet) in the morning with my coffee 3 days in a row. I noticed the expected effects - sleeping harder and vivid dreams despite taking it in the morning, a sense of mental clarity and decreased anxiety. It was great! The best day was when I took it with yerba mate instead of coffee. 

I suspect that I typically don't get enough REM sleep because I wake up so often, and L-theanine does seem to make me sleep harder. The problem is, I've noticed I really have to drag myself out of bed in the morning. Every morning, I was awake after about 8.5 hours, and then I would doze off for another hour and half or so. I was just so groggy. I stopped taking it for 2 days now, and I'm still sleeping like this - a little more than usual, and it's really hard to drag myself out of bed. I seriously suspect that this is the result of the theanine. I was hoping to see if anyone has had similar experiences. Do the side effects diminish over time, much like prescription medications? 

A part of me also wonders, is my body just catching up on sleep? I've been chronically underslept since childhood - school does a number on everyone, I think, plus my additional mental health issues. I'm 25 now, so that's about half my life getting too little sleep, and what little I've gotten is poor quality.

Again, I will be talking to my doctor soon, I just wanted to see if anyone has had similar experiences or any insight to provide. ",1,1742356772.0,NootropicsHelp,0,1.0,False

I'm an Asian butch and an athlete (swimmer). Got dark brown hair, cut short into a mid part or a brush back depends if I'm lazy or not. If you like tattoos I got a bunch 😉. My job is a Filmmaker and Photographer in the city, so you know I'll take good pictures of you and us ofc.

I haven't dated a woman before even though I've been out for 5yrs and am self-conscious about that. So if that bothers you, you can skip this.

Im sporty and would love someone who takes care of themselves and motivates the both of us to live balanced lives. Let's explore the city, go for a walk, a bike ride, a swim at the beach, go camping, gym, etc.

I love a good cuddle though and quite frankly have felt deprived of one for a good maybe 5yrs 👀. I love to sit and write, watch movies, cook, draw, when I'm home.

My favorite films: Dunkirk, little women, ratatouille, stranger things, arcane, sex lives of college girls, the wilds, tangled, La La Land

Typical style, idk sporty, casual, neutrals, jeans, tshirts, maybe a ring or two. Beachy during the summer, with a nice tan. Carhartt and blundstones during the winter. Kinda like a teenage boy but hotter and lesbian 🤣

Just wanted to share my own progress recently. Note that Im not totally at my goal yet but feeling optimistic.

So I hadn't had my period for 10 months, and started spotting daily for the past 6 months or so. About 9 weeks ago I decided to try myo-inositol. I tend to be very sensitive to supplements so I am actually only taking 500mg per day to see the effects. I also started taking Shepherd's Purse capsules to reduce spotting; it works almost immediately. It's just to address the symptoms and doesn't solve the problem, but I was relieved to be bleeding less. In the evenings I have a tea blend of chamomile and spearmint. I may need to increase that to 2x per day because my face hairs are not yet gone.

Besides supplements, I have been getting outside more, going for walks and swims, consistent yoga and stretching. Focused on reducing stress instead of heavy cardio. I cut out sugar from my coffee, quit sodas/juices and white bread and have been eating more vegetables overall. It's been helpful to make all meals from whole ingredients and avoid processed foods.

After about 2 months of these changes, I got my period finally! Im hoping my cycle resumes at least semi-regularly but for the moment I felt so relieved. Just wanted to share this in case it gives someone some ideas

I pictured i would leave this job too eventually to keep on doing new things exploring new things. I came back home to my parents to study full time (they made me be a doctor when i didnt want to but i have forgiven rhem for that). I was previously in an abusive relationship and i come from an abusive household (my family members have since changed a lot) and i truly wished to live somewhere near them even if it is in my country and not in US or UK where everyone seems to be going. I have a younger brother whom i helped in various ways after seeing what went wrong in my decisions and have helped stay safe (not everytime) from being at the receiving ends of parental abuse. I was never at the receiving end of it i was alwayd in my own room in my own world. Things have come apart after i left an abusive relationship and realised my childhood too had a great impact. My brother got into his dream job in UK where he always wanted to go. I’m still struggling to deal with my flashbacks, with my mom reminding us almost everyday how my dad used to beat her up (at slightest argument) she is a very kind and lovong person otherwise. My dad tries to be as available and as helpful as he can, he gets me coffee in bed every morning and stays cheerful to keep me motivated , funded my brother’s studies abroad (who now is super hurtful to him). I feel trapped mentally. I cant remember why i started doing what I’m doing. All my friends are specialist doctors. I feel I’m going deep into repeating mistakes that will make me end up in a place with mo escape. I have studied v hard this last two years but suddenly this all seems wromg and i cant get myself to study while my exam keeps on getting near. My closest friends who have betrayed me have also since moved abroad. Idk if things would be better if i just leave and never came beck to the third world country i am in. It feels like my brother escaped the matrix while i cant even see whether or not I’m in the matrix. And things are moving way faster than i could ever comprehend.

I have a car and they don’t, but they live and work by the building I was in so I just thought we could meet there. I told them to meet me at 2:10 and when that time rolls,  around I text them and called and it doesn’t ring so I know their phone is dead. I wait outside for maybe 35 minutes because I assume that they’re going to charge it. 

it’s not really a safe area to be waiting around, but i wanted to be visible if they were looking for me. I called again and their phone was ringing so I know that this point it’s on but they still weren’t answering. later they finally called me and they told me that they were sorry and their phone died and I was fine with that but then they told me that the reason it took so long is because they decided to shower(!!!!!!) while their phone was charging. 

I got pissed off at this point ( rare for me)   and said something like, what kind of person would decide to leisurely shower when someone is waiting on them without even checking their phone? i don’t know. i feel so annoyed when i think about it!! they asked me if I still wanted them to pick me up and I just said that I didn’t since it’s been so long, but I could come to where they were and we could go grab a coffee. 

then they They declined (?????!! they were the one that originally made plans ) and said they were going to see their friend but they would be free after and I said that they were disrespecting my time. i haven’t responded to their last texts. I feel like I’m usually a calm person, but I’m just so done right now. we’ve spent together for only seven months and I love them, but I have different standards for getting treated that make it hard for me to be OK with this kind of stuff. I prefer someone that is responsible and can take initiative and.. not leave me hanging. I did tell them how I felt but I just feel like really unsatisfied by their response and haven’t texted them all day",1,1742355247.0,relationship_advice,4,0.67,False

I'm from Nicaragua, guys I know like 3 roasters near me. De La Finca Coffee, Café las Marías and Peralta Roasters sell their own coffee, and Peralta mostly only sells blends.

 This past months I've been trying to find *you* on IG to see where I can get your coffee here and most tell me, we don't sell coffee in Nicaragua - their own country -. And if you do let me us know.
So Far I've been able to successfully buy coffee from this farms:
1. Finca Los Volcancitos - Natural and Washed Catuai
2. Venus Coffee State - Pending to finish purchase

If you are from Nicaragua hit me up, I'll buy, maybe not now but I will and my friend too just let us know you exists :(

1jeo1wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belize/comments/1jeo1wb/2_week_trip_review/,2 week Trip Review,"First off,  I want to say that I am VERY happy I chose Belize as my destination. It truly did not disappoint. 

I flew into Belize city and took a cab to the bus station to take a bus to San ignacio. It was actually very easy and super cheap. Not the most comfortable, but that's what you get for such a cheap price! It also wasn't too bad, and the views the entire time were beautiful. 

In San ignacio, I stayed at the Old House Hostel and had a really good time there. The hostel workers Aldo and John were both super accommodating and friendly, and would help me with whatever questions I had. I did the ATM cave tour with Patrick at limpkin tours and it was really amazing. He was about 20$ more expensive than other guides but in my opinion, it was worth it because he was super knowledgeable 
and on the way in we missed the big rush because we left early. 
I Played disc golf at a nearby course and it was about 5bzd to play and it was really cool, saw a couple of monkeys. I spent 3 nights total there and one of the nights there was an open mic jam night that I participated in. Super fun! 
San ignacio was beautiful, not much night life, but that was okay. 

I then took a bus from San ignacio to Belmopan, and transfered there to get a bus to Hopkins. All was relatively easy. Bus times are a bit random, but I think they came once an hour or something so I knew it would come eventually... haha. The bus drops you off at the junction outside of Hopkins and you have to take a taxi or hitchhike the rest of the way. People are very willing to pick you up and it doesn't cost too much. Maybe 10-20bzd a person. Negotiate before you hop in. 

At Hopkins I stayed for three nights at the funky dodo hostel. The hostels location was great, and the hostel itself was pretty good, but I was very surprised at the amount of 60+ people that were staying there more long term. There were still a few people my age (30), and I managed to gather a crew together to have some beers at the local bars a few of the nights.  The main beach in Hopkins was beautiful, but the downside was that the water was not very clear and there was tons of garbage on the beach. In front of the resorts they sweep/rake the beach to be more tidy. 
Overall, I was glad I visited Hopkins, I met more locals and felt like I had more of a local experience than any where else I traveled, but I don't know If I would be desperate to go back there. 

I hitchhiked my way back to the junction and got the first direct bus to belize city,  took a cheap cab to to get the water taxi to San pedro. It was easy and inexpensive. 

I actually really liked San pedro. I was ready for a bit more of a party vibe and the water was crystal clear with Ocean life literally everywhere. I saw an eagle ray while having my morning coffee, tons of fish, and a bull shark came to visit at night at the Palapa bar right across the street from my hostel (San bar hostel.) I had two snorkeling excursions from San pedro and both were amazing. I saw more sea-life than I have anywhere in my previous snorkeling/diving experiences. 

After three nights in San pedro, I took the water taxi to Caye caulker.  I stayed at Travellers palm backpackers, and it was pretty good. Bikes for rent, decent location, nice staff. Caye caulker was my favorite place. Sunny, clear water, tons of ocean life again, lots of younger people but also older people also having a great time. Drinking in the crystal clear water on a picnic bench, having fish swim around your knees was truly amazing. I got my Scuba Open water certificate there in two days (quite alot to get done in two days) and it was so worth it. It was about 450usd and worth every penny. I did it with Scuba Sensations. I spent 5 nights in Caye caulker and on my last night participated in the ""Sunday Funday"" at fellas backpackers. One of the most amazing parties of my life, but then I hopped on the 630 am first water taxi to belize city to catch my flight at 11am... it was rough. 

I had an unforgettable experience and I hope you all do too!

February 16th 2025 - We awoke, the air conditioner humming as we prepared for the day. Thank god for the air conditioning because I like it. Me and Sparky discussed how our day was going to go when I heard a noise creeping towards my room. My eyes grew wide and I turned to Sparky and shooed him to my closet. My door opens with a creak and my mom with her tired eyes and fake smiles comes in. “Hey Delilah, what’s new, cockatoo?”. “Mom, you know I’m too old for that nickname” I muttered. She walked to my blowup mattress and gave a confusing look. I quickly said “I slept on it because my bed was uncomfy”. “Ok” she said. “Hey mom look over there” and I pointed to the opposite direction of the closet, while she was turned, I looked towards the closet. I wrinkled my face and put my hand over my lip, signaling to Sparky to PLEASE not talk. Sparky opened the closet and signaled an “Ok” hand sign like this 👌. She turned around and said “Okay, I better be off to Walmart, I got another double shift.” “Ok” I said. She shut my door and I wiped my brow of the sweat it accumulated, that was a close one. 

Plans for the day:

* Do good work
* Drink some milk
* Investigate monster
* Live our best life

I wrote down my to-do list for the day and we quickly both took showers, and headed out for the day. “We have to figure out where their next hideout is” I said to Sparky. Cracked concrete filling our eyes, we walked down the sidewalk and started to question where to go first, the coffee shop is where a lot of people chit-chat and all that. We might be able to overhear something. Walking into the coffee shop the smell of coffee beans and baked goods filled the air. I saw the townspeople of Chipanoga (which is my town in Doors county) going about their daily lives, one guy got some chips from the vending machine and I giggled. “*Huh, what a tool”*.  Most of the conversation was the current exchange rate of milk in our town. Class III and Class IV milk is going up and the mayor hasn’t done anything about it. Our mayor is not well respected. One guy with a green jacket and black hat sat alone, and drank his coffee in silence. I sat down next to him, and Sparky did the same. In silence the guy drank his coffee as I questioned him and broke the silence “Hiya can I ask you a few questions?”. “No.” he growled. “Ok fine” I said and then soon after left. Me and Sparky were getting nowhere and fast, on top of that our tummies were growling. I sat on the damaged and cracked curb while Sparky threw rocks at passing cars. All of a sudden 3 black limos wooshed by us and Sparky looked up in the sky and smiled, he had a lightbulb going over his head. “That's it, Tim Walters,  the mayor!” I agreed with him. I got on my bike and we followed the 3 limos. 

I biked up the hill and to the…The Stinky Sailor? What was the mayor up to now? The stinky sailor was *the* strip club of Chipanoga (Chip-uh-noh-gah). If you were a dude and had some extra cash, you’d get off work and come here in a flash. It has certainly seen better days. The big highway sign no longer admitting its once neon glow. The paint on the walls are now cracked and foolish, the puddles on the floor are now vast and poolish. I urged Sparky to stay in the parking lot while I went and talked to the most hated man of Chipanoga (population 11,708). I entered The Stinky Sailor and already smelled the vile stench beer and booze. I walked to the Bouncer and he urged me to take a hit of his blunt. “C'mon man, it’s good,” He suggested. “No thanks, drugs are bad.” “Quit being a pussy,” he said. “No, really. I am good at sports and would not want to sully my reputation” He quickly put it in my mouth and I accidently inhaled. WTF. He gave me the jolliest rancher in his bag and I thanked him for it and went on my way. It was Blue Raspberry, what a joy. I walked further into the club, the DJ was jumping to the rhythm. The people were all dancing to “Party Rock Anthem” by LMFAO, the cocktail bar was in full swing, the bartender was doing that thing in basketball where he balances his cup on his finger and the strip club goers went wild.  My eyes scanned the room for the mayor. I asked one of the bouncers and they told me he was in the VIP room waiting for his lapdance.

 I barged in the room and he said “Who are you?”. “I am Delilah, I am with the Chipanoga Weekly Newspaper “Fine” he grumbled, “come on in and sit down”. He takes out a bottle of water. He sips. I could tell it wasn’t ideal that a “reporter” found him at a strip club. “Whaddya want from me, my approval ratings are in the toilet” He growled. (It was true, ever since he was elected in 2023, he’s had an average of 20% approval) “All they want is milk, I keep trying to give milk, but I can’t because there’s too many people and too little milk. I spend too much of the budget on milk”. I could tell he was stressed, his hair was a mess, his suit looked like shit. There was no doubt he was in a bad place. The Mayor said “By the way, in Spanish, Mayor means better”. Just then a martini glass started to transform into those fucking babies I saw kill those people down at the river yesterday in the forest. The mutilated looking newborn screamed a terrible screech. It’s skin pores leaking some sort of clear goo. “Mr mayor, get down!” and I got out my secret squirt gun and lined up the shot. Time seemed to slow as I aimed at it. I squinted and cocked the watery weapon. “Burn in hell”. I whispered.  SQUIIRT. It dropped into an ashy puddle and got low on the floor. Water vapor billowed from the barrel of my gun. “Mr. Mayor, meet me at my house at 9:30PM, bring a sleeping bag, I’ll explain everything”. The mayor looked shocked but for his own safety he knew it was safer to go along with this than not, he looked shocked but nodded yes. 

I saw Walters walk into my driveway, sleeping bag in hand. Smiling as I opened the door. He looked at me with a big smile and I shot him a thumbs up. “I told my wife I was having a sleepover at a friend’s house. I think she bought it"" he explained. I shot him a double thumbs up, as he stepped in my house three black cars drove away, his security team knew no boundaries. I motioned him to come inside my humble abode. He looked inside my house and looked in awe, “Wow, you’re so poor”. I frowned, “this is your fault, you spent too much on dairy, now look where I am”. He looked like he wanted to respond but I shhhed him, not wanting to have an argument when the stakes are as high as they are. A loud spring noise came from the kitchen! “Toast’s done!” Sparky cheered,  pounding on the table with a knife and fork in hand. It’s been a while since I got to use my spare toaster from Temu. I whipped out the butter and cinnamon, a treat I enjoyed since I was 8 (I am now 22). We enjoyed the light snack, we talked about the big things and we talked about the little things. Sparky talked about his new name. Walters talked about dairy. I talked about Rover and our relationship, they could tell I was on the verge of tears. They gave me a reassuring pat on the back and a grin to the face. I was whole again.

 I invited them into my bedroom and we got into my green tent in the closet. We all sat down criss-cross applesauce and held hands. We did this to make Sparky feel normal, as this was tradition in the cult. We were about to talk about our game plan. “We can’t let the cultists win” I said. “Yea” says Sparky. Having connections to the underworld and various social services, Walters was able to use his connections to eventually find the hideout, but it would take a couple days, as he could only find the most trustworthy to relay this information. “You can’t tell Chipanoga about this, the town would freak” I said worryingly. “Don’t worry, I won’t, my approval ratings would plummet even bigger now” Tim shakes his head at the thought of a lower approval rating than he already had at this time. With a new game plan and a sleepy head, I went to sleep. Tim was rocking the sleeping bag and Sparky had the air mattress like he did the previous night. I put on the Pewdiepie Amnesia series to have a little amnesia of my own, reliving the good ol days where I didn’t have to worry about creepy creatures. 

I went to sleep and was suddenly awoken by a young man’s voice yelling at me. It was strange, I was…standing? I don’t understand it myself and Tim was standing right alongside me. “Look!” shouted Sparky. “A couple of townspeople with their eyes shut were all going outside and walking around, shortly after they went back to their house. “Sparky what’s going on?”. “I usually go to sleep for around 4 hours, it makes me anxious to sleep any longer than 4 hours”. “I just saw you guys sleepwalk out of your beds, I think…I think they might be able to control you in your sleep”. Sparky said. I furrowed my brow in frustration, things were about to get a whole lot harder.",3,1742355067.0,creepypasta,2,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Once I walked her out, I figured, I might as well start my day. There have been some things I noticed needed cleaning, so I got started. I drank coffee and put everything in the room away or aside. This time, i wanted to record it on Timelapse, so I could post share what it’s like to clean my house. I put my phone on the stand and started working, section by section. I wiped down the tables, the window sills, and waxed the wood furniture. I then moved to the restroom. I cleaned the vanity area, the restroom, and I noticed in the sunlight that the shower could use a scrub. I did that, too. I then did the laundry and hung it out to dry. I swept the door step to my home and cleaned up the exterior garden. I went back inside to take a lunch break. I had a chicken burger with fruit juice, thank God. I then mustered up my strength to finish. I swept the whole house. I mopped, section by section. I finished by putting everything back and back together. I snapped a photo of the clean room. I picked out an outfit and showered. I tried to finish in time to join my friend for lunch and surprise her with cheese pizza, she’d been craving. I uploaded all of the content and thanked my viewers. I ordered the pizza and left to Taco Bell, where she works. The pizzeria was on the way. I was anxious because I don’t know if I was going to make it on time, but the pizza maker reminded me to be calm. I made it on time however , she had already eaten something (by the way she hinted, I think she didn’t feel good about eating). 

When her lunch was over, we said goodbye. I headed home and took the pizza for later. She said she was off at eight and wanted to go to Target. I told her I’d come back and meet her so we could go together. 

Since then, I’ve been at home playing video games and resting in bed. 

When the time came, I got up, put on a warm jacket, grabbed my stuff, and left. I got to see so many people along the way. Now I’m here waiting for her to be off.

Today, while at a networking event for my job, I felt a headache coming on and I quickly realized it was because I hadn't eaten since this morning. I had a small Coke and some chips to hold me over until I could leave and find some real food. Got to the train, headache was worsening and I felt nauseous and my neck was stiff but again I blamed it on my blood sugar. By the time I got to my car, I felt like I needed to go to the emergency room. My head was pulsating with pain, I felt dizzy and nauseous but I still had to get home so I powered through. Got about 5 minutes into my drive before I had to pull over and vomit into an empty paper coffee cup I thankfully had in my car. Felt slightly better, downed 3 Advil the second I walked in my door and then just laid on my couch in the dark until it kicked in.

 It's been about 2 hours since that episode and there's no more headache but I legit feel hungover. I do not know how anyone can deal with these on a regular basis, my thoughts go out to y'all. ",7,1742354423.0,migraine,1,1.0,False

You should work like that when you have your own business. “ and yeah compared to my peers, I wouldn’t say I work harder but I’m always trying to find something to do around the gym if I have the energy, rather than hang at the desk for the majority of time, if there’s nobody up there to help.

Day by day he starts pitching things to me and showing me numbers on his phone of him generating revenue for a business he started through square app and what not. He starts telling me about how just he moved here recently and changed his life.  He offers to show me how to become like him and start a business to generate passive income.

I agreed to meet up with him today at a coffee shop. We exchange a little bit of backgrounds and what goals we have. He is very eager to have me get an EIN number, register with the Secretary of State, form an llc , and tells me about a D&B. Long story short from my grasp he wants me to register a business in a partnership with him in both our names, and sign a one year contract. Most of what he is saying is speaking over my head because I have no entrepreneurship knowledge. He was ready for me to go through everything and start on the spot there with the EIN number though. 

I told him I have no money to start a business, prior experience of entrepreneurship, or the field that the business is in. He tells me that he’s going to fund everything. That my prior background (management and supervision experience) is perfect. he just wants me to be willing to learn, and run the business for a year.

That solved the main leaking issue the machine had but then it had no proper coffee flow and was causing our safety switch to cut power every time we used it. So I thought I’d ask customer service what options I had and they have done the repair under warranty.

My machine comes home sometime today and I am truly so excited to be able to use it.

1jenqlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alexithymia/comments/1jenqlo/a_bunch_of_questions_and_thoughts/,"A bunch of questions, and thoughts.","Hi!

1. Does anybody else have that one things that always makes you feel a certain emotion?

So for me, often times if i have a certain reaction to something, the second or third time around i’ll feel nothing. But there is one thing that has consistently made me feel sad and cry.  I don’t want to go into detail, but basically I am deeply insecure about the idea that for my sisters i am just a option, while for me they’re my only choice. Y’know.

2. I almost always feel this weird heavy feeling in my chest that i assume is anxiety. Like i feel it so often that i am starting to think i might have to go see a doctor😅. But when i am not feeling that, i feel pretty much nothing.

3. I also often seek out sad movies/tv shows/books, to make me feel something. One thing that i have to realise is that, at least when it comes to fanfiction, if a character feels abandoned or forgotten  by their loved one/ones, it will always make me cry. Might have something to do with point 1, but where just going to ignore that.

4. Now i have seen many people talk about how their affective alexithymia developed because of something that happened at some point in their lives. So i wonder if growing up in a somewhat dysfunctional family might have caused me to become this way. I am not entirely sure. Because i don’t have a good enough memory to remember a point in time where i could have potentially felt anything. If i asked my family they’d say that this isn’t the case because i was rarely the one involved in any of the fights, but maybe witnessing so many stressful situations might have messed me up. Now i will say that my situation was not nearly as horrible as a lot of other people on this subreddit, but this is something to think about. For me at least.

5. One of the things i have most trouble experiencing are positive emotions. Like i have felt some form of at least 5 different negative emotions before. Even if they were relatively watered down, i still had something going on somewhere. With positive emotions, all i’ve got is laughter, and my thoughts. I did think that i had anhedonia for exactly 1 minute before reading that to have that, you also need to experience 0 motivation. But as i have stated in my past few posts, i have motivation(drink water every time i write motivation in this paragraph),even if it comes and goes, i still have it.(This paragraph wasn’t long enough to warrant that last parentheses).

6. Sometimes i think about the day my family members might die, and i feel anxious at the possibility that i won’t feel sad enough. That i will cry for a bit and then move on. And that makes me think that what if the only reason i don’t want them to die is because I don’t want to see this scenario take place. My sisters always tell me that my tears come across as fake, which was probably one of the things that led me to this subreddit.

7. I remember the day we got our dog. I remember jumping in joy. I also remember that I didn’t actually feel any of that joy. It was just something that i had seen happen on tv. Another similar incident is from when i was even younger, and my dad got promoted. Once again, i had jumped in joy, and as far as i can remembe, I hadn’t felt any of that joy.

8. I cry so often, but never enough. They very second the moment passes, so do my emotions.

9. I laugh so much, but it is never accompanied by the feeling of happiness. 

10. I always hype myself up for things, like “oh i’m gonna go book-shopping, it is going to make me feel so nice”, and then it is just nothing. This always happens, i look forward to things, but they never bring me the same joy that they do to other people. I just want to feel a single nice emotion that isn’t just excitement. Which i may or may not feel.

11. I don’t like children. That is mainly because of how careful you have to be around them. You always have to be nice and act like you are interested in their games, when you are in-fact not. That’s not to say that i hate children. I was once a small child, and i know that i was most likely annoying, but I just don’t want to accidentally hurt their feeling and cause them to cry in that ear-piercing way. I try to be nice, which usually come to bite me in the neck, because that causes the kids to like me. So yayyyyy, i guess. I will still try to play with my sisters children if and when they end up having any. But for now; no thank you.

12. I have a lot of things that i enjoy, though most of them are pretty basic. Music, the kind that people call “basic white girl music”(i am not white). Taylor Swift, some of Sabrina, Olivia, and Gracie. I was super into MARINA back in 2022/2023 (can’t exactly remember which one) but than got kinda tired of listening to the same thing on repeat, and switched over to Taylor. I am looking forward to what is potentially a new album she is teasing. Are any of you looking forward to listening to Cupid’s Girl on Friday?  

Since music took up too much space, i’ll have to split it up. Anyways, i like romance films, and horror films. I have been trying to get into other kinds of movies, but i usually watch movies very sparingly, and often just stop watching a movie i had been looking forward to because i got distracted. Wicked it currently on the top of my list. Watched the first thirty minutes and then got up to do something else and lost interest in continuing. I will probably try again at some point. My favourite movie is 10 Things I Hate About You. I really enjoyed Kat and Patrick’s dynami, but found Bianca and Cameron’s underwhelming. That didn’t really take from any of my enjoyment though. My favourite horror movie is It (2017), I just really like the found family genre, and it had a pretty fun depiction of that. I would really like to read the book one day. It is an absolute behemoth.

I have realised that nowadays i can only watch shows to completion if i watch them with my sister, or if they are relatively short. I either lose interest, or start thinking of a different show, that i will also not watch, and than start scrolling through my list of shows i want to watch, feel no interest in any, and then start either scrolling on instagram, or watching a youtube video, which there is a 50/50 chance of my finishing. I have a routine of opening tiktok, going to my profile, pulling up every one i follow, go and watch the newest video posted by the people whose videos i still have interest in watching(which in a list of 50 or almost 50 people is like 5 or 6 people) and then not touch tiktok until the next day.

I have been learning how to properly draw, but i don’t think i am doing it correctly. I am doing what is basically a 30 day drawing challenge, and i am i think about 19 days in, but i am not entirely sure if i am getting better, or if i am just really good at following instructions.

I really like food. Food is my favourite things in the world. Which can be said for most people to be honest. On the topic of food, does anybody else have this habit of comparing the taste of whatever you are eating to something else? Like my sister take it as me saying that the food is bad, but i am just telling them that it tastes like something i have eaten or smelt before, y’know?

I am also super into crocheting. I just started leaning last year, and it has become one of my favourite things to do. I also plan on learning how to sew. Since these kinds of hobbies re practical, my family is a lot more supportive of me. My parents say that once we are done moving, they will buy me a sewing machine, and i am looking forward to it.

I also really enjoy reading, and i have been thinking about going to this one second/ first hand book shop that is near where we are moving to. It was relatively small, but i think that is better than going to a huge book store that is also super expensive.

I really, really like the scent of tea tree oil. My sisters recently got this tea tree based skin toner, and i lover just sniffing it.

13. When it comes to my family, especially my sisters, i get upset very quickly when they start paying to much attention to other people. I don’t think i feel the physical sensations of jealousy, but I certainly cry when that happens. Maybe it is because i literally have no one in this world except for my family. Or maybe there is something else, who knows. All i know is if i feel like my family prefers somebody over me, even if they don’t, i will get upset. My dad said to me that my sisters might choose to pay more attention to other people because they are living in their house, or for some other reason.

 But all i can think is that of course they would choose me if i was their only option, but i know that i will never be their first choice with other people in the room, and that is the one thing in this world that can always make me sad(remember when i said i wasn’t gonna get into it?). I know that they love me, but after basically forming a whole part of my personality around traits that i thought would make my sisters enjoy hanging out with me more, it hurts my feeling to see someone who has never put in that effort get that for free. 

Why does somebody younger than me get to be treated like they are their friend, while i get lumped in with the 4 year old. And why am i lumped in with the four year old only until everybody needs me to take care of them. Why am i treated like a little kid until they all need me to understand that “the kid loves you, don’t be like that🥺”. And by the way, it was them who told the kid that i would be their friend, i knew that the outcome would be something that I wouldn’t like, but their isn‘t much you can do when you are the baby of the family. 

Why is it that the only thing they ever tell people about me is that a) i am the beloved baby of the family (mocking) or b) that i am this shy soft-spoken person. While these are both either meant to be jokes or compliments, why can’t they ever tell people that i am funny, or that i was the one who showed them the show that they love, or that pretty much everything i know is something i learned on my own. 

Why do they never talk about how i always go with them to the bathroom because they are scared of going alone. Why do they never acknowledge that i grew up in the same messed family as them. Why am i the one who is treated like i have only seen the sunshine and rainbows part of our family when i was the one who stood there and watched my mother pretend to slit her wrist out of anger during a fight with my dad, thinking that i was about to watch my mother die in front of my eyes. I know that I didn’t have anywhere close to the same horrible experiences as my sisters, but that doesn’t mean that anybody gets to disregard that i had a bad time too. 

I know that i sound petulant, and that this is not that deep, but I don’t like it. And also, i am mainly just venting with this one, because even if i say this to my family, which i have, it will either get brushed aside once i have stopped crying, or i will not be taken seriously. I also am just not good with words, so i just won’t be able to get my point across anyways.

I know that i might have just trauma dumped, but that just comes with the territory, probably. So as a treat, i’ll have you know that i also, just like every single person on planet earth, enjoy the scent of petrichor. I also really like Tea, Coffee, and Sweets! 

Another thing i wanted to ask, and this the ultimate test to see if anybody read this far, beacuse anybody who has, is obligated to answer my question. Is the book ’Almond’ worth it? Does it have a good depiction of Alexithymia, or does it villainies the people who have it. I know that i probably won’t relate to it super hard, just like I don’t relate to any other book i have ever read in my life, but is it good? If you haven‘t read it, than you can just reply with some variation of “haven’t read the book.” or “I am not into reading.” and then carry on with what ever else you were writing. I just want to know if this book is worth my time.

And are there any other books, fiction or non-fiction,about Alexithymia, that you think are good or helpful. Let me know, and may you have a wonderful day/evening/afternoon/night. Bye Bye 😇.

1jenmag,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagoapartments/comments/1jenmag/xavier_apartments_review/,Xavier Apartments Review,"Just left Xavier after living there for two years. Thought I would write an honest review of the place.   
  
1. Noise Level Inside - The units themselves are pretty insulated from one another. I never hear anything from the people in the apartments next to me or below me. The apartment above me I can hear when they close their blinds and drop something on the floor. The only voices you can hear is when people from the hallway walk by. Each floor has a limited number of units so that's a non-factor.  Score - 9.5/10

2. Noise level Outside - I lived on the east side of the building near the fire and police departments. The sirens are annoying AF. The fire department used to be jerks and run their sirens backing into the firehouse at 2AM with no traffic anywhere around them. They fortunately stopped doing that. The cops will turn on their sirens when they want to get back to the station and don't want to wait at the light so that's fun. Not sure about the west side of the building which faces a residential street but on the East side - Score - 5/10.

3. Maintenance - I've seen people complain about this hear but I have experienced no problems. For critical issues they usually respond very quickly. For non-critical ones they respond same or next day. They are always friendly. Score - 10/10.

4. Cleanliness - Also seen people complain about dog urine in the elevators and smelly hallways. Again, not something I've experienced. They are quick to mop up any problems and the place always smells good. The only dirtiness I've experienced is in the trash chute rooms. Some residents get lazy or sloppy at times. But overall - Score - 9.0/10

5. Building/Garage Safety - I never felt unsafe in the garage or building. We are right next to a police station. I asked the front desk if they were aware of any crime occurring outside the building based on the some of the reviews I read and they were unaware of anything. Score - 10/10

6. Area Safety - The building is next to a Target, a fire station and police station. All in all the immediate area feels safe. Going north and south from the building also feel pretty safe. Going east and west however feel less so. There are large fields, some run down building and some rougher areas. It is still Cabrini Green. I didn't wander east or west after dark, even though old town is only a mile or so east. (If you are wondering about my credentials for this assessment, I worked regularly in some of the most dangerous neighborhoods across the country for about 6 years. I usually have a good feel for area safety). Score - 6/10. 

7. Friendliness - I never had a negative encounter with any resident in the building. Everyone seems pretty friendly. Friendliness - 10/10

8. Amenities - Gym is medium size. Has dumbbells up to 70 lbs., TRX bands, kettlebells, a smith press, a plethora of bikes, treadmills and elliptical machines. It was somewhat crowded after work but otherwise usually pretty empty. There is a pool table, free coffee (often broken), grills and a pool. Some outdoor fireplaces. The 18th floor is a lounge/work space. The view is really good. Everything is clean and generally well maintained except stuff here and there. Nothing special but overall solid. Score  - 6/10

9. Concierge - Overall pretty solid. Friendly, helpful and usually present. Score - 9/10.

10. Management - Again, pretty good. I've seen some people complain but my experiences were always positive. They did just completely turn over staff and I have yet to have much interaction with them so the grade is incomplete. 

11. Parking - There is a garage which generally has availability. Street parking can take around 40 cars in the immediate blocks. If you venture out a block or two you can almost always find street parking. I think once in two years I could not find one. One note of caution is the no parking signs are not always present and they will write tickets for places where there is no markings or signs. Like don't park within 30 feet of the stop sign. An obscure Chicago rule that's usually marked but does not have to be. Score - 8/10.",3,1742353677.0,chicagoapartments,0,1.0,False

39 F 175cm currently 70kg.. I know I’m in a normal weight range but was sitting comfortably (and happily might I add) around 66-68 for the last (almost) year.

I don’t know what’s changed! I have been eating the same way since April last year and suddenly in the last 2 months I’ve gone up 3-4kgs. It’s not a cycle thing either as my weight actually stays consistent thru cycle.

Typically I consume/do:
- Meal 1 steak( approx 260-300g) and butter with two eggs, or; 4 scrambled eggs with butter and maybe halloumi

- Meal 2 1-2 steaks and butter (depending how hungry I am 

Drinks lots of water

1-2 coffee a day with small dash of 100% cream

Will sometimes have pork crackle (maybe once a week/fortnight), extra butter or a slug of cream if I get a sweet craving 

Train weights 3-5 times a week
A couple of big walks a week (8kms or so)
Job is active, always on my feet, up and down stairs etc.

Muscle has increased very slightly but body scans are showing sharp fat increase, and I’m feeling fluffy.

One of the things I LOVE about this WOE (apart from generally feeling fucking excellent) is not counting calories and eating til satiated. I’m worried I need to maybe cut back my food intake?? It just goes against everything i have learned so far, not to mention the last year of results and doing.
Have also tried increasing my fat intake to no avail. 

Advice or anyone in the same boat? I’m feeling frustrated!!!",2,1742353557.0,carnivorediet,3,1.0,False

I think my mental health is going down the gutter. Went cause paranoia issues, sorta was open about it? Not very, it proceeded to wax and wane. Just talked about other stuff mostly. Fine...ok it didnt actually go away for long so i decided to try again and eh got some resources. 

Welp.. there was ""other stuff"" I occasionally wanted to mention but it sounded so out there that I decided not to talk to a therapist or anyone as a matter of fact. It all would occasionally stop for a little bit before building back up. 

Don't want to be honest about the ""other stuff"", took me a while to be honest about the paranoia but the ""other stuff"" just sounds bad/worse. Rn just alot of spirituality and the frequency of it(feeling spiritual entities mostly and communicating with them) just kinda blew up to being nearly daily....which eventually I just got used to and decided not to bring it up. Then occasionally I got into feeling that others might know what I'm thinking? And I got into the whole telepathy thing again(thought I could be able to develop telepathy in my teens idek i had plans and all so i guess this is an extension of that). Welp it stopped, wasn't like fricking up my life, but then now i'm thinking that again but I had a thought that some of my familly was mentally communicating about me and hey that sounds paranoid and weird. Idk. I can't be honest about a therapist about that cause that sounds really weird! 

Most of the time its whatever and t i feel like i'd be blowing any issues out of proportion. (had to convince myself I wast blowing the paranoia out of proportion and should still talk to a doc). Thought quitting coffee would help.. it did with the paranoia mostly but not completely.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jengwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jengwl/i_just_want_my_mugs_to_stay_in_my_office/,I just want my mugs to stay in my office!,"I'm writing this because I'm literally seething right now and it's not the time to have a petty argument at all.  Sorry it's long...

TLDR: My office mate has started to take my mugs out of my office space when the 7 other we have a filthy in her office. It's driving me up the wall but I can't confront her today.

I share an office space with a friend of mine. We have very separate working areas and until recently, I thought she was very respectful about my things. 

We both have ADHD, but very different kinds. Mine is the inattentive kind and hers is the hyperfocus kind. We both have trouble keeping our work spaces clean and tidy because we're creative, hers is disgusting though. Moulding plates, mugs and cutlery, piles of clothes, nothing is ever in any organised place, it's awful. Her section has a kitchenette and a bathroom which I've had to stop using because they're so filthy. I'm not defending my space at all, the floor is always covered in debris and bags and materials pile up everywhere all the time. I do give it a thorough clean once a month though. 

When we first moved into this space, I bought us both a mug, ""this lovely one is for you and this lovely one is for me"" kind of thing, I always have a work mug and I love mugs at home. I had old mugs too so I brought in about 4 or 5 other mugs too and she brought in 3 or 4. One of the mugs I brought has a photo of my dog on it. The other mugs I don't really care about, but my favourite one and my dog one I always keep in my office and keep clean for when people come by. The reason I do this is because every single other mug has ended up in her section, half full of mouldy coffee and I end up having to round them up and bleach them because she just won't. 

Well, my bench where I keep my mugs is near a window to the kitchen area, I never thought anything of it until a couple of weeks ago when I noticed they weren't there when I went to make myself a coffee, I looked in her space and they were there, half full of old coffee. She wasn't there so I just grabbed them, washed them, made myself a cuppa and put them back, thinking not much else of it, but being a bit miffed.

Well today, I've not been in the office since this time last week, and again they're both in her space, but this time she's there and having a tough couple of days. So now I'm in a position where I can't storm in and snatch my mugs back because it's truly the least of what's pressing right now, but I also want a coffee and there's not a clean fucking mug in sight, they're all filthy in her space.

When I brought it up with her before about how I like my mugs and would rather she didn't use them, she said I was weird for having a favourite mug but sure she won't use it again. That only lasted until the next time I'd left it in the drying rack and she wanted a coffee. 

She definitely doesn't do this to be annoying or mean, I believe she genuinely doesn't think about it and then she also doesn't think about the issue I'll have when i have to find my own mugs to clean them to have a coffee for myself. She just 100% doesn't see it as an issue...and to be honest, that kills me. We're adults and it just shouldn't be a problem when we work together, just respect my things please! I also hate a double confrontation ""remember ages ago when I told you I don't like it when you use my mug, well, now I can never find it so please don't use my mug when you have about 7 others dirty in your space"" that's so awful, especially today! 

Not looking for any advice, our working relationship is great outside of that and how messy she keeps her space is entirely her business and none of mine. I just want to keep my things out of it!",1,1742353204.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.67,False

While dating my gf of 3 Years.,"         So first let’s add some context. In college I met this girl and I thought she was going to be my wife. We dated all the way through college. She ended up breaking up with me a few months before graduation. It crushed me I was depressed, stuck in my room. Watching paw stats on repeat. But I had to force myself to get out there. So I got on tinder and matched with this girl and we went on a date. Had a lot of fun with her and really enjoyed her company. She was really pretty but honestly polar opposite of what I usually date or my type. But we keep hanging out, it was nice to not be alone and have someone I could hang out with. Next thing weeks turn to months and before I know it we’ve been dating for a year.

         I have met her family, I went to her brother wedding. She’s met my family this has become something really serious before I knew it. She is truly amazing she does so much for me and I do a lot for her. But I knew in the back of mind that this is not what i want. But the truth is I got comfortable and I was having fun. Fast forward another year. We are going strong both working  toward our goals. I love this girl I really do. In that same year I had gotten a new coworker at work. Her and I hit it off immediately we had so much in common music, humor, interest. We had become best friends. This is going to sound hard to believe. But she was engaged when she started working. So I never thought about her romantically. I thought she was attractive but nothing more. But it soon became my favorite thing was going to work because I would get to talk to her.

     Fast forward some more and she has broken off her engagement. Honest to god truth it’s horrible but I was happy when she told me that. I knew this was the type of person I wanted to be with. But she was older than me and I thought out of my league. But as time goes on we become closer and closer. Until eventually after work I get a text from her. We had never communicated outside of work. Ask if we can meet up at a coffee shop to talk. That we do and she tells me she has had feeling for me for a long time and they have only gotten stronger. I told her how I felt about and from that point forward we could not get enough of each-other. This all while I am still dating my gf. Everyday after work we would see each-other. Our conversational chemistry was already amazing but intimately and physically it was next level. We were so in sync that it was like we had always known each-other. We’d talk for hours after work. Never enough of each other. This is what I had been longing for so long.

My coworker and I loved each other. I started changing my future plans so I could be with her. But as things went on our attachment let’s becoming stronger. But what she wanted to do with her life and I wanted to do weren’t going to work. Especially with out age gap so we chose to end it. This one really hurt. My first break up I believe was sad but amplified by it being first. This one killed me she was everything I wanted but we just met in unfortunate times in our lives. It only makes it worse that im still dating my gf. Who loves me unconditionally which makes me feel terrible. But I need to break up with her. Because when I see her all think about is the other girl. But breaking up with her is going to crush her. But I should’ve thought about that before I cheated on her. But yeah I’m a scumbag and I feel terrible. ",2,1742352829.0,offmychest,1,0.75,False

1jen9t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jen9t5/i_fell_in_love_with_another_woman_while_dating_my/,I fell in love with another woman. While dating my gf of 3 years.,"         So first let’s add some context. In college I met this girl and I thought she was going to be my wife. We dated all the way through college. She ended up breaking up with me a few months before graduation. It crushed me I was depressed, stuck in my room. Watching paw stats on repeat. But I had to force myself to get out there. So I got on tinder and matched with this girl and we went on a date. Had a lot of fun with her and really enjoyed her company. She was really pretty but honestly polar opposite of what I usually date or my type. But we keep hanging out, it was nice to not be alone and have someone I could hang out with. Next thing weeks turn to months and before I know it we’ve been dating for a year.

         I have met her family, I went to her brother wedding. She’s met my family this has become something really serious before I knew it. She is truly amazing she does so much for me and I do a lot for her. But I knew in the back of mind that this is not what i want. But the truth is I got comfortable and I was having fun. Fast forward another year. We are going strong both working  toward our goals. I love this girl I really do. In that same year I had gotten a new coworker at work. Her and I hit it off immediately we had so much in common music, humor, interest. We had become best friends. This is going to sound hard to believe. But she was engaged when she started working. So I never thought about her romantically. I thought she was attractive but nothing more. But it soon became my favorite thing was going to work because I would get to talk to her.

     Fast forward some more and she has broken off her engagement. Honest to god truth it’s horrible but I was happy when she told me that. I knew this was the type of person I wanted to be with. But she was older than me and I thought out of my league. But as time goes on we become closer and closer. Until eventually after work I get a text from her. We had never communicated outside of work. Ask if we can meet up at a coffee shop to talk. That we do and she tells me she has had feeling for me for a long time and they have only gotten stronger. I told her how I felt about and from that point forward we could not get enough of each-other. This all while I am still dating my gf. Everyday after work we would see each-other. Our conversational chemistry was already amazing but intimately and physically it was next level. We were so in sync that it was like we had always known each-other. We’d talk for hours after work. Never enough of each other. This is what I had been longing for so long.

My coworker and I loved each other. I started changing my future plans so I could be with her. But as things went on our attachment let’s becoming stronger. But what she wanted to do with her life and I wanted to do weren’t going to work. Especially with out age gap so we chose to end it. This one really hurt. My first break up I believe was sad but amplified by it being first. This one killed me she was everything I wanted but we just met in unfortunate times in our lives. It only makes it worse that im still dating my gf. Who loves me unconditionally which makes me feel terrible. But I need to break up with her. Because when I see her all think about is the other girl. But breaking up with her is going to crush her. But I should’ve thought about that before I cheated on her. But yeah I’m a scumbag and I feel terrible. ",1,1742352545.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False
1jen9o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jen9o9/politics_obsessed_family/,Politics Obsessed Family,"Alright alright, I need some help with navigating my politics obsessed family. Personally, I lean left and do not express the same values as my family which is generally fine. Honestly, that’s life and you have to mingle and get along with people you disagree with. What I have a problem with is how intensely my family follows extremely slanted, biased news stations religiously. 

Every single day, 24 hours a day, FOX news is playing on a tv. It makes them miserable, I should mention. They always have a reason to be pissed off, without even taking a second to check other news sources and carefully evaluate the information they are intaking. They talk about Trump like he is a family friend, my brother called him ‘an alpha male’ and my mom quite literally said that she wouldn’t care if he did assault women. 

I don’t mean to sound antiquated and outdated, but it makes me cringe. Like I get actual, second hand embarrassment from how they talk about him. More than that, they just constantly run their mouths and want to have political discussions when politics is not a part of the conversation at all.

“Hey, I was thinking about making a pot of coffee. You in?” 

“Yeah, sure. You know, since Trump won America again, immigration is going to be abolished.” 

Okay slight exaggeration, but you get the point. It’s so suffocating, and you have to walk around eggshells on them. Not to mention the cultish right leaning music my brother listens to and sings at the top of his lungs. I just don’t know how to navigate them in the slightest, but they make themselves miserable, so they turn that misery out onto other people and I’m so frustrated. Anyone have any advice?

1jen9kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1jen9kf/i_work_as_a_babysitter_in_the_night_for_a_creepy/,I work as a Babysitter in the Night for a Creepy Family…There are STRANGE RULES to follow.,"([Narration](https://youtu.be/EyoS9WFTeNE) By Secrets in the smoke)

**Some jobs aren’t worth the money. Some jobs aren’t worth the money.** 

Some jobs take more from you than they give. I learned that the hard way.

At the time, I was desperate—College tuition was draining my bank account faster than I could keep up, and my part-time job barely covered food and rent. Every time I checked my balance, it felt like a punch to the gut. Bills kept piling up, and no matter how many extra shifts I picked up, I was always falling behind. I needed a side job—fast. Something easy, quick, and preferably well-paying. No complicated interviews, no weeks of waiting for a paycheck—just instant cash.

That’s when I stumbled upon the ad.

**""WANTED: Babysitter for one night. Pays $500. Must follow instructions carefully.""**

Five hundred dollars for a single night? That was insane. Too good to be true, really. Babysitting usually paid, what, fifteen bucks an hour at best? My first instinct told me there had to be a catch. Maybe it was a prank. Maybe it was some kind of scam. But then I thought about my empty fridge, my overdue internet bill, and the fact that I had about twenty dollars to my name. I wasn’t in a position to be picky.

Without overthinking it, I grabbed my phone and dialed the number listed in the ad.

The phone barely rang twice before someone picked up. A woman. Her voice was cold, distant—completely void of warmth, like she was reading off a script.

**“Be here by 7 PM sharp. No guests. No phone calls.” She said,**

I opened my mouth to respond, to ask any of the hundred questions running through my mind, but the line went dead before I could get a single word out. No introduction, no small talk, nothing. Just an address and a set of rules.

That should have been my first red flag. Who hires a total stranger without even asking basic questions? No ""Do you have experience?"" No ""Have you worked with kids before?"" Just… instructions. But five hundred bucks for a few hours of babysitting? No way was I passing that up.

I drove to the house and arrived.

The house was massive. Not just big—**mansion** big. It stood at the very end of a long, deserted road, surrounded by nothing but empty land and thick, shadowy trees. No neighbors. No streetlights. Just a cracked, lonely pavement leading up to an eerie, towering house.

A single porch light flickered weakly, barely illuminating the front door. The whole place looked straight out of one of those horror movies I usually avoided. Something about it made me hesitate. The silence. The stillness. The way the windows loomed like dark, empty eyes.

I took a breath, shaking off the creeping unease, and walked up the steps. My knuckles barely brushed against the wood when the door creaked open—like someone had been standing behind it, waiting for me.

A man stood in the doorway. He was tall, painfully thin, with sharp features that made his hollowed-out face look even more severe. Deep, dark circles pooled under his sunken eyes, like he hadn’t slept in weeks. Maybe months. Despite his exhaustion, his suit was crisp, perfectly pressed, not a wrinkle in sight.

Behind him, a woman hovered stiffly, her posture so rigid she looked like she might shatter. Her hands were clasped tightly in front of her, knuckles bone-white, like she was holding onto something for dear life.

The man’s gaze locked onto mine. His voice was flat. Mechanical.

**""You’re the babysitter?""**

I swallowed, my throat suddenly dry. “Yeah.”

The woman stepped forward before I could say anything else and shoved a folded piece of paper into my hand.

**""These are the instructions.""**

I glanced down at it but didn’t open it yet. Something about their urgency made my stomach twist. **“So, um… where’s the kid?”** I asked, forcing a small smile.

Neither of them answered. The woman didn’t even blink. She just turned on her heel, grabbed her coat, and started toward the door.

**""We’ll be back by sunrise,""** she said quickly. **""Follow the rules, and you’ll be fine.""**

And then—before I could ask anything else—they were gone. The door shut behind them with a quiet but firm **click.**

I stood there for a long moment, gripping the piece of paper in my hand, my unease growing by the second. Why had they left so quickly? Why did this whole thing feel… wrong?

Finally, I looked down at the list.

The paper was old, slightly crumpled, and covered in tight, neat handwriting, each letter carefully formed, as if someone had taken painstaking effort to make sure every word was clear. It wasn’t printed, no official babysitting instructions—just a handwritten list. aIt wasn’t rushed or scribbled—it was deliberate. Like whoever wrote it **needed** me to understand.

My eyes skimmed over the rules, my stomach twisting with each one.

**Rule #1 : Put Timmy to bed by 8:30 PM. If he asks for a bedtime story, only read from the green book on his shelf. Do not read any other book aloud.**

Okay… strict, but fine. Maybe it was a sentimental book or something.

**Rule #2 : Lock all doors and windows before 9 PM. If you hear scratching at the back door, do NOT investigate.**

I blinked. What? That was weird. Why would there be scratching? A raccoon? A stray cat?

**Rule #3 : Do not answer the phone after 11 PM.**

My pulse quickened. Why? Who would be calling? And why would I need to ignore it?

**Rule #4 : If Timmy tells you someone is outside his window, do NOT look. Tell him, “Go to sleep, Timmy.” Do not say anything else.**

Okay. No. That was officially creepy.

**Rule #5 : If you hear footsteps upstairs while Timmy is asleep, ignore them. Whatever you do, do NOT go upstairs.**

A lump formed in my throat. Footsteps? But there shouldn’t be anyone else in the house.

**Rule #6 : At 11:33 PM, the kitchen door will open on its own. Do NOT close it. Do not look inside. Let it remain open until 11:42 PM.**

My hands felt clammy. I wiped them on my jeans.

**Rule #7 : If you hear a child giggling from the second floor, ignore it. The boy you are babysitting is asleep.**

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the top of the list, rereading every rule, hoping maybe I had misunderstood something. But the words were still there, clear as day.

**Rule #8 : If you wake up on the couch and don’t remember falling asleep, leave the house immediately. Do not look back.**

I let out a nervous laugh. A dry, humorless sound. This had to be a joke, right? A prank? Maybe the parents were just messing with me—some weird rich people humor I didn’t understand.

Then, I heard a voice.

**“Are you my new babysitter?”**

I jumped, my heart slamming into my ribs as I spun around.

A little boy stood at the bottom of the staircase, staring at me with wide, tired eyes. He couldn’t have been older than six. His blond hair was messy, sticking up in different directions like he’d been tossing and turning in bed. He wore pajamas—soft, blue ones covered in tiny stars.

I forced a smile, trying to steady my breathing. **“Yeah. You must be Timmy.”**

He nodded. **“Did my mom give you the rules?” He asked.**

Something about the way he asked sent a chill up my spine. His tone wasn’t casual or curious. It was serious.

My stomach twisted. **“Uh… yeah.”**

His expression darkened. His small fingers tightened on the banister. **“You have to follow them.”**

I stared at him, unable to respond. His voice was quiet, but there was a weight behind it—something heavy, something that made my skin crawl.

I shook off the unease, forcing myself to focus. It was just a kid. Just a weird set of rules. Nothing was going to happen.

I led Timmy upstairs, my footsteps echoing in the quiet house. His room was small and tidy, with a little twin bed and a row of stuffed animals lined up against the wall. Everything was neatly arranged, like it hadn’t been touched in a while.

As I pulled the blanket over him, he whispered, **“Don’t forget to lock the doors and windows.”**

I nodded quickly, not wanting to show my discomfort. **“I won’t. Get some sleep, okay?”**

He didn’t answer, He studied my face for a moment, like he was trying to decide if he could trust me. Then, finally, just turned over, hugging a stuffed bear to his chest, and he closed his eyes.

As soon as his breathing evened out, I left the room and made my way through the house, double-checking every door, every window. The locks clicked into place, one by one, until I was sure everything was secure.

I had just finished locking the back door when I heard it.

A faint scratching.

I froze.

The sound was soft but deliberate. A slow, dragging scrape, like fingernails running over the wood. My breath caught in my throat.

A cold chill ran down my spine as my eyes flicked toward the paper still clutched in my hand.

Rule #2: **If you hear scratching at the back door, do NOT investigate.**

My throat tightened. Every instinct screamed at me to look—to check, just to make sure it wasn’t, I don’t know, a tree branch or an animal. But something deep inside me **knew** better.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my pulse hammering in my ears. **Just walk away. Ignore it. It’s nothing.**

Slowly, I forced my legs to move, stepping away from the door. The scratching continued behind me, steady and patient, as if whatever was out there **knew** I was listening.

Minutes passed. The scratching continued, slow and rhythmic, until, finally—it stopped.

I let out a shaky breath.

I spent the next hour glued to my phone, scrolling through social media mindlessly, trying to drown out the silence. But the quiet was suffocating. The whole house felt… wrong. Too still, too heavy, like the walls themselves were holding their breath. Every creak, every shift in the floorboards made my heart pound.

I forced myself to check the clock.

Then, at exactly 11 PM, the house phone rang.

I froze.

I jolted so hard my phone nearly slipped from my hands. The old landline sat on the wall near the kitchen. Its shrill, piercing ring shattered the silence, echoing through the dimly lit living room, sharp and unrelenting. My breath hitched.

Rule #3: **Do not answer the phone after 11 PM.**

I turned my head slowly, my gaze landing on the old-fashioned phone sitting on the small table across the room. 

I stared at it, my pulse pounding in my ears. The ringing didn’t stop. It just kept going, over and over, like whoever was on the other end wasn’t going to give up.

The ringing was insistent, demanding. 

Like It knew I was here.

It rang again.

And again.

And again.

I turned my back to it, gripping my phone in my hands, trying to ignore it. Just a few more seconds, and it would stop. 

Each ring made my stomach clench tighter. 

My fingers twitched. My breathing came fast and shallow.

What would happen if I answered? Who would be on the other end?

I squeezed my hands into fists, my nails digging into my palms. **Ignore it. Just ignore it.**

Seconds dragged on like hours. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the ringing cut off.

Silence.

I let out a slow breath, forcing myself to relax.

But just as my shoulders sagged—

**“Miss?”**

My stomach plummeted.

I spun around so fast my vision blurred.

Timmy stood at the bottom of the staircase. His small hands gripped the railing tightly, his knuckles white, his eyes wide with fear. His face was pale, his lower lip trembling. When he spoke again, his voice was barely above a whisper.

**“There’s someone outside my window.”**

My blood ran cold.

**Rule #4** flashed in my mind.

**If Timmy tells you someone is outside his window, do NOT look. Tell him, “Go to sleep, Timmy.” Do not say anything else.**

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to keep my voice steady. **“It’s okay, Timmy. Go to sleep.”**

Timmy didn’t move right away. His small fingers gripped the banister, knuckles turning pale. His lip quivered as he shifted on his feet. **“But… he’s staring at me.”**

A chill spread through my body, icy and slow. My instincts screamed at me to run upstairs, to check, to **look**—but I knew I couldn’t. The rules were clear.

I forced a weak smile, even though my hands were shaking. **“Go to sleep, Timmy.”**

His wide eyes flicked toward the hallway, and for a second, I thought he was going to argue. His little body trembled, a quiet fear radiating from him like static electricity.

But then, slowly, he nodded.

Without another word, he turned and padded back toward his room. He climbed into bed, pulling the covers up to his chin.

Then—Timmy asked suddenly.

**“Are you scared?”** 

My breath caught.

I turned my head slowly, my heart hammering in my ears.

Timmy was still sitting upright in bed. He shouldn’t have been—I had just tucked him in, just watched him lay down. But there he was, sitting silently, watching me.

His pale face seemed even paler under the dim glow of his nightlight. He was small for his age, fragile-looking, with dark circles under his eyes.

I forced out a short, nervous chuckle. **“Of what?”**

Timmy didn’t blink.

**He didn’t answer.**

Instead, in a quiet, almost pleading voice, he whispered: **“Don’t close the kitchen door.”**

A cold, twisting fear coiled in my stomach.

I pressed my lips together and nodded. **“Okay.”**

I left his room and shut the door behind me—firm, but gentle, careful not to make a sound. I could still feel his gaze, burning into my back.

I didn’t check the window. I **couldn’t** check the window.

My legs carried me downstairs on autopilot, though every step felt heavier, harder to take. I tried to shake off the nerves, tried to convince myself this was all in my head.

I was trying to calm the wild pounding in my chest. Just make it through the night.

The rules were just… just **weird rules**, right? The parents were strict. Maybe paranoid. Maybe they had a reason for all of this.

Maybe I was just overthinking.

I settled onto the couch, wrapping a blanket around myself, my hands clenched tight in the fabric.

I glanced at the clock.

**11:32 PM.**

My stomach twisted.

My fingers gripped the blanket tighter.

And then—

**11:33 PM.**

A long, low creak echoed through the house.

My body went rigid.

The kitchen door **swung open.**

I didn’t move. I didn’t even breathe.

A deep, suffocating darkness seeped out from the doorway, **too dark**, stretching like ink bleeding into the air. The doorway itself looked… wrong, somehow. Like it was pulling further away, stretching longer than it should have been.

I squeezed my eyes shut. **Don’t look inside. Let it remain open until 11:42 PM.**

I fumbled for my phone with shaking fingers. The screen glowed in the darkness.

**Seven minutes left.**

That was all. Seven minutes. Just wait. Just sit still.

Then—From the darkness, I heard breathing.

Not mine.

Not Timmy’s.

Something **else**.

It was deep and slow, a wet, rasping inhale, followed by an even slower exhale.

I pressed my back against the couch, my nails digging into my palms. My whole body was tense, every muscle locked in place.

The breathing got louder. Closer. So close, I could almost **feel** it against my skin.

A shudder crawled up my spine.

My phone screen flickered.

**11:41 PM.**

Almost there. Just one more minute.

The breath hitched—like it was shifting, moving.

The clock finally struck **11:42 PM.**

The sound stopped.

I opened my eyes and looked..

The kitchen door was closed.

My chest heaved as I sucked in a shaky breath. My lungs burned, like I’d been holding it in for too long. My fingers, still clenched into fists, slowly unfurled, the movement stiff and reluctant. When I glanced down, my palms were marked with deep, crescent-shaped indentations where my nails had dug in too deep. A sharp sting ran through them, but I barely registered the pain.

It was over.

For now.

I checked the time again. **11:43 PM.**

The house was silent, but not in a peaceful way. It wasn’t the kind of quiet that brought relief. It was the kind that pressed down on you, thick and suffocating, like something unseen was still there, lurking just beyond sight. Watching. Waiting.

I stayed on the couch, refusing to move. My body was still coiled tight, my muscles aching from the tension. I tried to focus on my breathing, to slow my racing pulse, to convince myself that everything was fine.

But my heart barely had time to slow before I heard—A child’s giggle.

The sound came from **upstairs**.

I went completely still.

My eyes darted to the baby monitor on the coffee table. The small screen showed Timmy’s bed. He was there. Asleep. Not moving.

The giggling got louder.

It wasn’t him.

My throat tightened.

Rule #6: **If you hear a child giggling from the second floor, ignore it. The boy you are babysitting is asleep.**

I clenched my hands into fists, nails biting into my skin. **Ignore it. Just ignore it.**

The giggling stopped.

For a moment, the house was silent again.

Then—

From behind the couch.

A whisper Came.

**“You’re no fun.”**

A cold rush of terror flooded my veins.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I stayed perfectly still, my body locked in place, waiting.

The silence stretched on.

I sat there, frozen, until the house felt normal again.

I exhaled shakily, barely realizing I’d been holding my breath. My chest ached, my muscles weak from how tense I had been. I forced myself to check the clock.

My body sagging in relief. My heart was hammering so hard it hurt. 

**See? Nothing happened. I followed the rules, and nothing happened.**

**Everything was fine—**

And then—I heard Soft footsteps. Upstairs.

I went rigid.

I was on the couch. Timmy was asleep in his room. I had checked. I had seen him.

But, I could hear them.

Slow. Deliberate. Measured steps pressing against the wooden floor above me, moving with an eerie patience.

I gripped the armrest, my fingers digging into the fabric.

**Rule #5: If you hear footsteps upstairs while Timmy is asleep, ignore them. Do NOT go upstairs.**

I squeezed my eyes shut, breathing through my nose. **Ignore it.** It’s just noise. Just a house settling. 

I clamped a hand over my mouth, choking back the instinct to scream.

**Ignore it. Just ignore it.**

I squeezed my eyes shut, pressing my back harder into the couch, as if that would somehow shield me from whatever was up there. My whole body trembled, a cold sweat slicking my skin. The footsteps didn’t stop. They moved again—slow, deliberate. Pacing. Back and forth. Just above me.

My mind raced.

**Who… or what… was up there?**

No.

It didn’t matter.

I wasn’t going to find out.

A floorboard creaked.

The steps were moving—down the hall.

Toward Timmy’s room.

A sharp, icy panic tore through my chest. I wanted to run, to throw open his door and grab him, but I couldn’t. **The rules. Follow the rules.**

Then, I heard A whisper.

**""Miss? Why didn’t you listen?”**

A shudder rippled through me. My vision blurred. My chest ached, like the air was too thick, too heavy.

My fingers trembled as I rubbed my eyes. My breath came in short, ragged gasps.

I kept my eyes shut tight, forcing myself to block out the sound. **Don’t react. Don’t acknowledge it.** Seconds dragged into minutes, each one stretching unbearably long. 

And, Then—The footsteps stopped.

Silence.

Darkness swallowed me whole.

The dizziness hit me hard, like something had sucked all the energy from my body in an instant. 

For a moment—maybe longer—I was weightless, drifting in a void of nothingness. There was no sound, no sensation. Just an endless, suffocating emptiness. My mind felt disconnected from my body, like I was floating in a dream. Or maybe a nightmare.

My head swam. My limbs felt weak.

And then—I collapsed.

The world faded to black.

I don’t remember dreaming. I don’t remember anything at all.

I must have dozed off because the next thing I knew, I was waking up—

In Timmy’s bed.

My entire body turned to ice.

The sheets beneath me were soft. The air smelled faintly of dust and something… stale. Wrong.

I bolted upright, my pulse slamming against my ribs. **No, no, no—**

**Rule #7: If you wake up somewhere other than the couch, immediately leave the house without looking behind you.**

I sat up, frozen, my breath coming in sharp, panicked gulps.

The air around me felt thick, heavy, pressing down on my shoulders. I couldn’t hear anything—no wind, no cars outside. Just a deep, swallowing silence.

The mattress dipped.

Suddenly, From the darkness behind me, a voice whispered.

**“Emily… where are you going?”**

Something was in bed with me.

A cold sweat broke across my skin.

I did not turn around.

I forced my body to move, inch by inch. My hands trembled as I pushed the blanket off. My feet touched the cold floor.

Behind me, the presence shifted.

I bit the inside of my cheek so hard I tasted blood. **Don’t run. Don’t panic.**

And, My decision was already made.

I was leaving.

Not just this house. Not just this job.

This **town**.

I packed what little I had, stuffing my bag with trembling hands. No goodbyes. No explanations. **I didn’t want to explain.**

Because I didn’t understand.

And worse—I didn’t want to.

I stood.

I walked forward. I kept my head down as I stepped outside. 

The floor creaked under my steps.

Behind me—footsteps followed.

Soft. Slow. Playful.

I reached the hallway.

The footsteps quickened.

A breath—cold and damp—brushed the back of my neck.

**I ran.**

I hit the stairs, skipping steps, my legs burning as I pushed forward.

The footsteps behind me pounded faster, matching my speed.

I reached the front door, my fingers scrambling over the lock. My hands shook so badly I nearly dropped my keys.

I yanked the door open.

The cold night air hit me like a wave.

I sprinted outside, my heart slamming against my ribs.

I didn’t stop.

Not until I reached my car.

Only then did I turn back, gasping for breath, my hands still shaking.

The house was dark.

The front door—still wide open.

Something stood in the doorway.

Watching.

Waiting.

I didn’t stay to find out what.

The next morning, as I looked at my purse, I noticed Timmy's bear inside my bag. I had to return it, no matter what. I couldn’t keep it.

My hands still trembled as I dialed the number from the babysitting ad.

It rang once.

Twice.

Then—someone picked up.

A man’s voice. Not the father’s. **Not the mother’s.**

**“This is Officer Daniels.”**

I hesitated. **“Uh… I was trying to reach the family that lives at—”** I gave him the address, my voice unsteady.

Silence.

Then, in a careful, measured voice, the officer asked, **“Who are you trying to reach?”**

I told him the couple’s names.

Another long pause.

A cold, sinking dread settled in my stomach.

Then, finally, the officer spoke.

His voice was quiet. Cautious.

**“…That house has been abandoned for twenty years.”**

My mouth went dry.

**“No,”** I whispered. **“I was there. I babysat their son.”**

The line was silent for so long that I thought we had been disconnected.

Then, the officer exhaled. A slow, careful breath.

**“There was a little boy that lived there once.”**

I gripped my phone tighter. My heart pounded so hard it hurt.

The officer’s voice was barely above a whisper.

**“But he died in 2003.”**

The call cut off.

I stared at my phone, my chest rising and falling too fast.

Then—

I felt it.

A shift in the air.

The tiny, creeping sensation of being **watched**.

Slowly, stiffly, I turned my head.

I looked at the bear. It wasn’t the same anymore.

((DISCLAIMER, this is based off my location and how we do things. Every tims will be different!! And again these are MY peeves, so please don't get mad at me for them! Read at your own risk I guess??))

-When customers in drive through say hello first (like yeah dude we know you're there. Give us a second.)

-Driving off before we tell you to drive up 

-Getting mad when we ask you to repeat something.

-Repeating your WHOLE order when we asked for clarification for ONE thing 

-If you're waiting in line, and you have the time to, and by the time you get to the window you DONT have your payment ready or rewards card even opened? What're you doing while you sit in line? Why can't you get your cards out or wallet out while you're waiting? Why make us wait when we just want you out of the drive through??

-Emptying out your whole damn car into our trash. (I say this because the garbages aren't there for you to put your own bags of trash into. It fills them up and makes it so other customers who just want to get rid of one coffee cup, can't, because someone else decided to put their bags into ours. This one's here specifically because today, someone had filled our outside bins with their own random trash, on top of random empty boxes and other trash, right into the bins... Like, why can't you just do that at home?? Do you not realize some poor minimum wage worker has to clean up after you because you were to lazy to take it out yourself? And then most likely be yelled at for taking too long to do the garbages?? Agh. Personal experiences here sorry-)

-Coming in with a resume and asking to see a manager (they're busy and I can guarantee you that they aren't gonna look at your resume until they have freetime. The normal employees are perfectly happy to drop off your resume instead of you making us think there's a complaint.)

-Not turning off your big loud trucks engines while you're at the speaker box and getting mad when we can't hear you. If you have to yell to hear yourself then maybe you should turn the engine off. 

-The passenger giving orders. (I say this because we can hear the driver A LOT better than the passenger 90% of the time.)

-asking for an extra hot latte (there's no setting to do that...? The machine does it by sensing how hot the milk is and it goes by that.)

-Extra crispy bacon.. similar to the latte thing. It's all the same and we can't make it extra crispy (but I sure wish we could!! I'm a crispy bacon person but my store usually ends up with chewy bacon.)

-More specifically the night shifts, but not calling in when you wanna order more than a dozen donuts. The bakers stop making donuts at a certain time and when you come into the store at 7pm asking for 4 dozen donuts, you best believe you're getting an angry baker and all of the old fashion plain donuts we have.)

-Going through drive through and ordering a take12 box... Please just.. just go inside.. 

-When you get to the window and you're greeted, I expect a hello back not just... Silence. I hate that. We greet you so why can't you give us the bare minimum back? Or not saying thank you when we give you your order, just driving away...

THATS IT FOR NOW!! Once again these are my own thoughts and annoyances with customers. I'm curious to see if anyone shares the same thoughts!",4,1742352495.0,TimHortons,22,0.7,False

It’s not manipulation, it’s about creating an emotional experience so powerful that she *wants* to be with you. Think of it like hacking the attraction code.

**How Does Swingcat Teach This?**

The course is structured with step-by-step lessons, covering:

* How to dismantle a woman’s ""critical factor"" (the part of her brain that resists attraction)
* The secret language of arousal that triggers deep sexual desire
* How to create tension and release to make her emotionally addicted to you
* Psychological tactics that naturally lead to intimacy

It’s packed with practical techniques, real-life examples, and exercises to help you internalize the skills quickly.

**Final Thoughts – Is It Worth It?**

If you’re tired of traditional dating advice that just doesn’t work, ""Swingcat - Sexual Connections"" offers a refreshing, psychological-based approach to attraction. It’s not about cheesy pickup lines or trying to impress women—it’s about flipping the script and making *them* chase you.

About me: From Toronto currently working as a store manager. It doesn’t seem like a great career for some but it pays well and has been very rewarding.

Hobbies and interests are cooking, photography, working out and I’m a big foodie and love coffee. I also like to watch anime too.

I’m pretty introverted but will give 100% effort for anyone that does the same. I don’t drink or smoke. 

Not into the whole hook up thing if we do anything sexual I want it to mean something.

Appearance: 6’1 mixed half black and white, on the lighter side. Athletic build with curly hair and facial hair.

Don’t be scared to shoot a message!",1,1742352037.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,0.99,False

1jemyzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1jemyzx/vyvanse_and_social_anxiety/,Vyvanse and Social Anxiety,"I'm diagnosed with ADHD and have been taking Vyvanse for it since roughly May of 2024. In the beginning, it worked wonders for me, which is typical for stimulants. But the thing that impressed me most was that it seemed like my social anxiety was massively improved. I had on-and-off struggles with socializing as a young lad. I did eventually get to a good point where I wasn't a social butterfly or anything but I had friends and wasn't afraid to actually talk to them. Then I got cancer, then COVID happened, so two to three years of continuous isolation flushed that down the drain and I struggled, until May of 2024

But as the months went on, my Vyvanse became less effective in most aspects. Even after slowly increasing the dosage up until reaching the peak of 70mg, it never quite reached the level of effectiveness that's expected of it. But even at its worse, my attention and focus and executive dysfunction was still better than how I would do off the medicine. The one aspect I've definitely noticed a major decline in is my social skills. I feel like they're the worst they've ever been, a complete reversal from when I started the meds rather than just being less effective like how Vyvanse impacts other aspects of my mental health. I also tend to get into caffeine binges every now and then where I relapse and drink a lot of soda and coffee after going a while on just water, which I know can impact anxiety but idk about social anxiety

My psychiatrist recently prescribed me Guanfacine to pair with my vyvanse which I've heard helps both the efficacy of stimulants and also reduces anxiety. I'm also starting therapy next week for social anxiety. But even with all of that, I'm wondering if a dosage decrease might be best. I guess I'm just wanting to see if anybody here has had similar experiences and how y'all solved it if you did

I also take 20mg prozac too",3,1742351572.0,VyvanseADHD,5,0.81,False

Got advice from another thread to prolong the drying phase a bit and did just that.  Turned out a bit past medium point which is what's recommended... no less than medium.  Couldn't wait so took it to my V60 and this stuff grounded with little resistance with my JMax, and it looked like brown saw dust.  I didn't mind it.  The result was pretty good. no sourness nor bitterness at all.  Tasted chocolatey and earthy with a slight charcoal taste to it.  Very pleasant.  Can't wait to espresso this thing tomorrow :D
