1innhne,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1innhne/the_weight_we_carry/,The Weight We Carry,"I'm 28M. I met her eight years ago, just a fleeting moment etched into memory, like a song you hear once but hum for years. There was an unspoken connection, a spark neither of us fully acknowledged, tucked away beneath the layers of life that kept moving.

Last December, fate or maybe something bigger brought her back. A simple gym session, sweat, laughter, and the easy rhythm of two people who should’ve never lost touch. As we lifted weights, I realized the heaviest thing in that room wasn’t the iron plates; it was the truth sitting quietly in my chest. I wanted her. Not just for a moment. Forever.

After the gym, we grabbed coffee. Just us, in a corner of the world where time seemed to slow. Her laughter filled the spaces between sips, and her eyes told stories her words couldn’t. That coffee wasn’t just coffee, it was the moment I knew. The kind of knowing that anchors itself in your soul.

Since then, it’s been endless phone calls. Late nights stretching into early mornings, voices weaving together like a song only we know. It feels right, more right than anything I’ve ever experienced. Like the universe finally aligned after years of being slightly off.

But life’s messy. I’ve been in a three-year relationship, the kind where comfort masquerades as love. And she? Engaged. A nine-year relationship sealed with a ring she almost refused.

We didn’t need to say much. It’s in the way her voice softens when she says my name, the quiet between our words filled with more meaning than conversations I’ve had in years. We’re two people orbiting different worlds, pulled by gravity we can’t see but can’t ignore. Love doesn’t always come dressed in convenience. Sometimes it arrives late, with complicated baggage and impossible timing. But when it’s real, you feel it, in your bones, in the spaces between heartbeats, in the ache of what could be.

And that’s the weight I carry.

1innfzg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1innfzg,My reviews on some popular fragrences I have been trying for a month,"Art of arabia3:pretty strong,oriental,sweet and intoxicating scent.Really spicy in the opening which eventually levels down. Gets boring after a while and can be clogging or nausiating for some. Lasts a good time. Might buy a full bottle.

Vintage radio:Ligth,sweet,fruity,pleasant and overall high quality scent for its price. Although its lighter than some winter fragrences it is still long lasting. Will buy a full bottle.

Art of nature 2:Smells like cookies with strong vanilla ice cream.doesnt project much but lasts long enough.

Art of arabia 1:light,kinda smells like a lemon soap, overall good but doesnt project much and lasts around 6 hours on my skin.

Afnan supremacy not only intense:smells too mossy and not very pleasant to average nose but long lasting.

Afnan Turathi blue:Opens with a strong grapefruit that stays through. Eventually some spice comes in. A simple scent but not bad.

Khamrah Qahwa:Starts of with a coffee note that lasts 30 minutes. Really unisex and sweet. It is a nice pleasant smell but it doesnt smell expensive. Smell reminds me of a scented candle.

Afnan Asad:Smells like a worse sauvage elixir cologne that lacks richness,depth and power.

CDNIM:Really harsh unpleasant opening, develops into a smokier another aventus clone.Overrated in my opinion

Btw for context I am 20M and i have tried the summer fragrences indoors for a fair review since the weather is cold. I have bought these fragrences 5ml sample sizes so i have tried them multiple times with giving them 2 weeks apart each try at least one time

When Benten can't learn the truth about the Three daughters, she goes on her own. While alone she meets nassur & Lum on a New journey to save Oniboshi\*

It was the first breeding season for this generation, and Lum is ready to mate since she was a 800 year old (8 years old to be biological). Meanwhile two infant babies, Sugar and Pepper are facing Lum and Benten who are facing each other over this situation.

Young Benten: ""This is a load of rubbish! Its mateing season!""

Young Lum: ""Breeding season!""

Young Benten: "" Mateing season! ""

Young Lum: "" Mateing season! ""

Young Benten: ""BREEDING SEASON! ITS BREEDING SEASON EVERYBODY COME ON RUB THE COWGIRL!"" Benten get completely reacked by what she said because she just encouraged every single Alien on this planet to ""breed"" with -----

Young Benten: ""Very clever, but i'll get you back for that one.""

moments Later, Ginger was sick and tired of being Babied around so, she asked her sisters (in baby language) how to get attention they need, want and deserve. Since its all part of the Law of the jungle to punch the biggest, strongest guy in the Room to become the main Alpha Alien they would need to find someone worthy and more powerful then them.

Meanwhile at the orphanage, The three daughters are now in a kraang battle. And somehow, Ginger sees something on top of the roof. It was Zorun, leader of the shadowians. He then tries to impress them by saving her sisters. The Girls got confused, But pepper feels like she saw Zorun just before he flied off.

Outside, Zorun starts training the girls how to fight and defend because about getting recognition Zorun feels that they are the right kids for the job since he sent them to space to Cosmic Elementary, 2 Weeks earlier. Sugar thinks Zorun has a point, while Pepper and Ginger thinks Zorun has bad intentions even if he was trying to make their wildest dreams come true.

Zorun Coffee: "" i was just demonstrating how formidable you three are. I knew you weren't going to attack them your talents are stray and your mussels are weak, but i can change that if you let me i can turn you into a powerful machine of disaster, you don't reason with the enemy, you don't Show any mercy, find a good strategy and and retreat when it fails. You Take Them Out with out fail. ""

It was at that point where Zorun started to give them new nicknames and new abilities.

Sugar, the rainbow, Pepper, the snake, and ginger,... They will be called The Three daughters, ""i'm going to make you **famous**, i'm going to make you a **legend,** and i'm going to make you **noticeable**.""

Somewhere at the Oniboshi park, a 15 year old kid named nassur was late for military service for training, his hole crew of youngens left him alone to go out with their families for Breeding season, (""mating SEASON! "") ""Tomato, Tamoto""

Teenage nassur: "" They left without me. They do this every Year! ... Alright, Fine! I'll finish my tacks without you! That right am the kid i'm the Future I'm-

""NOBODY CARE!"" Said an Alien carelessly, walking pass him.

The Three daughters are now hanging out in the desert garden, and suddenly, they saw what they were looking for, they saw a New kind of challenge, in fact their first challenge ever in history. Sugar comes up with a plan they should have worked but it was too late. The Challenger has escaped their sight, and the girls can't find *her* now.

""If you have done this my way, that girl would have been toasted strutle by now!""

"" this way would have worked if you haven't wasted time second guessing my orders! ""

""Don't give bad orders, AND I WON'T SECOND GUESS THEM!!!""

"" fine, Sugar. The Teams yours now! Whats your plan. "" Sugar now becomes team leader, leaving her sisters to wonder what she was planning.

Benten was feeling poor for herself now, but Lum comes up to her and told her that ""There's a secret family treasure hidden in the Centre of the Planet.""

Young Lum: ""So, what do you think? You up for saving the world?""

Young Benten: "" World shmorld. I reckon That thing's worth a FORTUNE! I'm in! ""

While trying to get to the Desert garden, nassur accidentally bumps into two bullies, and made them very angry.

They started to chase after him chatting ""😡SO MEAN,😱 SO MEAN, SO MEAN😭!"" , and nassur runs for his life, until he then bumps into Benten & Lum.

Young Benten: ""Hey, what are you doing!?""

Teenage nassur: ""Don't mind me ladies pretend am not even here!""

The bullies still want to finish him, Lum decides to bargon with one and when the other one refuses to compromise Benten shoots a missile at its face sending it flying in the air and crashing back down to the planet below and then Runs for its life because of its head injury.

Young Benten: ""You guys just made my night!""

After saving nassurs's life, nassur decides to walk with Lum, Lum tries to shake him off but nassur just keeps following her.

Young Benten: ""You wanna play games? I can handle it but i need your word, That you'll Stay out of My way!""

Secretly Lum follows them mid air ""what is this guy's problem with me?""

Meanwhile:

At the Central park Aquarium, 4 Short Cyborg Ducks were just having fun doing their thing. But later, they got a message from someone. It was the girl who escaped the Three daughters in the first place. So, Flipper, the leader of the group, decides to go on a mission by himself, leaving his other man to stay in their place in case of an emergency.  
""Looks like we have a job to do!""

After miles, Skipper has met up with Benten and nassur.  
""The name's Flipper. We're the galactic elegance.""

"" Don't see how thats your business. ""

""Oh! Well, we've got something else.""

Flipper then tells both of them whats going down in Oniboshi tonight. ""

In his story he talks about a man named, Captain Shredin:



And this Copycat wants to Invade Planets to quote and quote ""*Use thee ancient ability of the Succubus to steal the ability of a anomaly to use the Form of the Aliens to qoute end quote.""* Invade Planets with their love ones body. ""He's truly MAD! He's working on a whole nother level and he won't Play fair. "" Benten then decides to come with Flipper to see what its all about.

Young Lum: ""That ""Copy Cat!"" wants to Invade Planets and for no price? But what did he mean by ancient ability? ... Uh oh, Ran!""

Lum then rushed away to warn Ran while doing this Nassur notice this and followed her to her friends location. ""Lum wait!"" Nassur called out.

Young Benten: "" ""Alright, we'll follow up on his lead, and then bust the poor guy out the front door.""

Sugar, Pepper, and Ginger  
Were on their own now, with Sugar being the leader.  
They entered a area where people are being trapped by some kind of mutant monster. They think that the girl is somewhere around here.  
The girls now need to steal the supplies and weapons before they get caught.  
""Let's cut em loose!""

They saved all the people, but a monster named M.U.T.O popped out and attacked the girls! Now they must try to defend them selves.  
Outside the shortcut, was new space lab. Benten has never seen anything like it before.

""Oh, this is a problem."" Now they need to come up with a plan.  
""We need some kind of ditraction.""  
"" what ever it is, it can't be good. Let's shut this place down. ""  
""Alright kids. Commence Operation: Special Delivery!""  
the team are now taking down the Copycat Alien INVADERS with arrow bombs.  
Now all the Copycats are distracted. Now the next thing to do is to shut down the ship so that Captain can't invade the Planet. ""Okay, we need to disarm this ship.""

Sugar, Pepper and ginger were in this area too. But then more Copycats came up, and Ginger tries to ask them some directions.  
""Okay, Buster wheres that Succubus child with that pink hair?""  
The Copycats then chase after all three and are trying to find some way to escape. And whats more M.U.T.O was still after them dispite alrighty having two tails on their spines. After a lot of Running, Ghidorah (The three headed monster) Came up tangled M.U.T.O with his demonic Neck Charged up its gravity beam and sended it back to the Earth it came from. They arrived back at base, and they tried to wake up ginger making sure shes not Dead, although she looked dead.

Infant Sugar: ""This is all my fault, i don't know what happened.""

Infant Pepper: ""Oh ginger don't DIE! Whos gonna be my wind girl, whos gonna be my best maid, WHO'S GONNA BE MY TAX COLLECTOR!?""

Infant Ginger: ""You want me to be what COLLECTOR?!""

Infant Pepper: ""Ginger your ALIVES?! Well, to bad for me i guess.""  
  
Infant Sugar: ""Don't scare like that buddy i thought i Lost you. And We'll LOST you again if you Ever scare me like that AGAIN!""

Ginger learned her lesson, and so now they gotta find Benten.

Benten has finally deactivated the ship and reprogrammed it to to go to a uncertain location, but more Copycats came up. The team are now for another battle. Nassur managed to find a skate-hoverboard, and then ram into the copycats like a Boss!

EAT MY STAR-DUST, POWDER POWER! ""

**The battle was over. Benten has never been so proud** of herself, and now it was time to celebrate for a little while. ""I Feel so much POWER."" But the fight was not over yet. Captain Shredin appears out of nowhere, and takes the form of Ran-cha.

Sugar, Pepper and ginger arrived and they finally found their first challenger. ""Challenger!"" ""What !""

Young Benten: ""I'm out here risking our necks and your out here holding necks with them, what you got a bone to pick with Me?""

Infant Sugar: ""Let me explain.""

Then Zorun popped out too! Then he was a discovery that Zorun hired Captain Shredin to invade Planet Oniboshi. He already created a Mutant this whole Time! Then Sugar saw Lum popping out and toke her out in one swing.

""Lum-Cha!"" Benten was so surprised She appeared.  
The final Battle is now starting with one big team together. Then Oyuki and Plantrah heard the commotion from afar and popped up to join the fight.

Young Plantrah: ""i leave oniboshi for two seconds.""

Before they could even do anything Captain Shredin threw a sharp boomerang at Oyuki shapely cutting her garment sleve her reaction total anarchy, She said with a patient but strict announcement.

Young Oyuki: ""*of course you realise this means war.""*

Now it was time to save Oniboshi once and for all. But it was now getting too hard.  
After lots of pain, Benten notice something. ""Lum's right. I can't do this on my own.""  
Now Benten is the only one standing, and its up to her to save her friends. She was more focused on Zorun because She had a plan to take him down. ""Hey, Nassur!"" Benten Yells ""Me!?"" "" Take My Hand! "" Nassur leads Lum to an electrical machine. For the finishing touch, she created a lighted up sword just by her electricity alone, Hits the Control panel. Zorun flies out of the Ship before it drifts into the sea , along with Capatin Shredin and the Three daughters retreat, and soon, They'll be back for another plan.

""Nice Work.""

""Thanks, Good to be back.""

Lum was happy to see Oyuki and Plantrah, and Benten Thanked Nassur with a kiss and a hard punch to the elbow.

After learning their lessons, They Kids RETURN home. And now it's a perfect time to celebrate. And of course, they have new friends including Nassur, Flipper and Plantrah! During the party, Flipper and the rest decides to make plans for more visits, especially if there's any more danger coming up soon. ""I didn't know about you guys, but we are the weirdest Team i've ever seen."" Then Nassur came in uninvited and saw that the the kids were eating hotdog pizza worms. Young Lum: ""They just let you in?""

Teenager Nassur: ""Well i could't wait till i saw that you were okay.""  
Lum looked confused and shocked at the most for holding her hands, Benten tries to defend her but Nassur explains this.

"" Lum, Listen my name is Nassur. I was build in training to be your personal Bodyguard i hope forward to working with you what ever you need i'll do it just say the word. ""

""Names Plantrah from Planet Plant, my people have fought by your side and now you will dine with ours, but we need a name for you Three i'm thinking.""

Lum, Benten, Oyuki: "" THE GALAXY GIRLS! ""

Epilogue:

Outside Lum's house, being uninvited to the party, Sugar was pretty upset that they never test their Luck. But Ran, who is strangely in fancy diskies, with a hat and sunglasses, came up to them and told them to come to her house for the night instead. They Both walk together until Captain Shredin grabbed hold of Ran and gagged her with a napkin that quickly put her to sleep and kidnapped her. Ginger hoping that none of what she was doing was important.

Caregiver : ""Don't worry, Girls i'll tell you a special deal.""

Infant Sugar: "" ....... YOU WANT HOW MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!???????? ""

The End!

I’m having an issue with my Nespresso Vertuo Pop. When making coffee, water used to leak from all sides of the machine. I cleaned the entire device, opened it up, wiped everything inside, and reassembled it.

After that, I tried running the descaling process, but I noticed that the machine only performs a cleaning cycle instead. During rinsing/cleaning, before all the water from the tank is used up, the light starts blinking red. When I press the button, it goes back to blinking orange with a steady frequency.

I’ve tried restarting the machine, holding the button for 7 seconds, and even unplugging it for 10–15 minutes, but as soon as I plug it back in, it starts blinking orange again.

One thing I’ve noticed is that when I unlock the lever, the light turns off. But when I lock it again, it immediately starts blinking orange.

I also cleaned the barcode scanner, so that shouldn’t be the issue.

This gave me the idea that, it did not have the liquor license. But to my surprise when they gave me the printed bill, I saw +400 written on it, which ofc was the beer with Rs140 as its market price. So I told them, that I won’t pay the extra license amount for you when you don’t have one. They told me that alcohol is not allowed in Varkala but then I had already visited this Tibetan restaurant that served me beer in a beer mug and the bottle not wrapped in a newspaper. And finally, with all the experience that I have, I only paid the base mrp of the beer.

Have any of you ever experienced something like this in Varkala or anywhere in Kerala?

This was my first time visiting Kerala. I’ve travelled to all the South Indian states now. Even though there were bad events on this trip, Kerala tops the list of my favourites. The beauty of the beach and serenity of the mountains culminate in Varkala.

From the start, I felt drawn to him. He listened attentively, spoke thoughtfully, and carried himself with a quiet confidence that made him even more attractive. But there was something else—something I couldn't ignore. Whenever I tried to bring up more intimate topics, he would subtly steer the conversation away or give a vague response.

I wasn’t sure what to make of it. Was he shy? Did he not trust me yet? Or was he simply the type of man who took his time before opening up? It was my first time dealing with someone like him, and I found myself both intrigued and unsure of how to navigate it.

Despite this, I couldn’t deny how much I liked him. He was different, and maybe that was a good thing. I just had to figure out how to reach the part of him he wasn’t ready to share yet.

Any advice 


Did I made a grave mistake by bringing intimate topics while I don't know his reaction and his  circumstances? 


Edit . He is new here ( USA )  for studies

Never did smoking or drinking. Been single for more then 6 years now. I am vegetarian but I don't mind if you are a non veg eater. 

Currently unemployed but I am graduated with a fancy degree, also scored well in my boards. 

I like to read self help books, watch series/movies (Marvel Fan) and do my general accounting, not into doing lots of expenses. I am mostly a home person and an introvert to be precise. Punctual and empathetic by nature. Beyond right or wrong I prefer perfection. I got limited or no friends, they are just a contact now. 

Yes, I want to be Childfree as its expensive & too much time plus energy consuming all life long and not to forget the burden on the female too to bear a child. 

Further this might sound weird but I think its because I am more genetically prone towards my mother by nature. Before going ahead with marriage I would like to be in a relationship, so that we can know each other well. 

I need a life partner whom I will call as my Patni-Parmeshwar. I want to live in her shadows once the knots are tied and live my life for her. I am an all rounder in household chores but I need to learn cooking all I know is how to make a cup of coffee & maggie.
Get up before her make a breakfast for her, get her clothing ready for the day as she is busy getting fresh in the morning. 
Take overall care of her from morning till night. Kind of worshipping her (Patni-Parmeshwar). In all this she must always take me seriously & never take me for granted while being honest & loyal. I don't mind if she wants to pursue her career or studies I will support her with my whole heart. In her success, happiness & growth lies mine. 
I will give her all my care, support to her amd whatever she asks for, its like I wanna be a traditional house-husband and live my life according to her conditions & norms. I seriously don't mind in shifting myself to her home but I don't want anyone apart from her in that home but it depends as she says. And do whatever possible for her while nurturing her too. 

Trying my best to find a soulmate.

Please do DM with your intro if you see this as us together and lets see where it goes or just wish me luck.

For me age doesn't matter till early 30s or 35+. Race, caste, skin color, body type etc doesn't matter what matters is my partner must be with me till the very end holding my hands tight.

# Case Study: My Experience as a Beta Tester

I had the chance to be a beta tester for the AI Live School Builder, and the journey was nothing short of inspiring. I began with little experience in online education, but this platform made every step clear and manageable.

I started by creating a small online school focused on basic science and mathematics. The setup process was smooth as I was guided through every step by clear instructions and useful video tutorials. Within minutes, I had a live school with AI-powered teachers, interactive classes, and an automated system to enroll students—all without hiring any additional staff.

One of the things I appreciated most was the automated student finder. It helped me attract a steady stream of students who quickly signed up for my classes. I focused on refining the content rather than stressing over marketing. Within a few weeks, I began to see a significant increase in subscription numbers and engagement levels.

The streamlined grading system and automated test modules saved me countless hours. Instead of manually grading tests or scheduling individual classes, I could rely on the software to handle routine tasks. This gave me more time to interact with students and tweak the course content based on their feedback.

Another impressive aspect was how well the live classes worked. The AI-powered teachers provided clear, real-time explanations and answered student queries immediately during the sessions. This live interactivity made the entire learning environment feel personal and responsive, almost as if I had a small team of competent teachers by my side.

Being a beta tester also allowed me to offer feedback on improvements. The support team was incredibly responsive and took my suggestions seriously, making me feel part of the development process. Their willingness to listen and adjust features based on real-user experiences reaffirmed my confidence in the product.

The overall experience was fulfilling both as an educator and an entrepreneur.

I'm a newbie when it comes to ESP32 and my electronics knowledge is basic at best. I'm looking for a bit of sanity checking, and I'd happily tip someone a coffee!

**The project**

My project requires moisture and temperature ""sensor stakes"" for use in composting. They need to be wireless and battery powered, and ideally last a month between battery changes. The sensors will be mounted on plastic pipe with the ESP32 in a waterproof box above ground.

So, I'm looking at using ESP32 with a LiPoly battery monitor built in (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5900) and a LiPoly battery (e.g. https://www.adafruit.com/product/1578). For the temperature sensors, 2x DS18B20s (https://www.adafruit.com/product/642), these come pre-sealed with the resistor built-in. For moisture a capacitive sensor, again pre-sealed like https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2054.html. I've included a relay as my research shows the moisture sensor corrodes slower if it's not constantly powered, I assume the same is likely for temperature sensors.

I'm fairly confident in the programming side, having looked at various similar projects people have made. It looks like with the aid of the DallasTemp and OneWire libraries I can work with the sensors, then it is a case of looping relay pin HIGH; wait for sensors; read sensors; relay pin LOW; delay one hour.

The electronics however is not my area of expertise. Being based in Madagascar it takes a while for parts to get here, so I can't experiment/afford to make mistakes. I've made a breadboard diagram in Fritzing which hopefully illustrates my plan, and I'd be very grateful for any feedback.

**Specific questions**

* Is the relay wired correctly?
* Where do I begin on calculating how long the battery might last?

I never expected it to end like this.,"I stood in front of the café, watching her through the glass. After eight years. Eight years since we last spoke beyond a few words on social media. And now she was there, still beautiful, perhaps even more so than before. Her hair was longer, her gaze calmer.  

I walked inside, and she smiled at me. That smile hit me right in the chest, as if it bridged all the years we had been apart. We sat down and ordered coffee. The first few minutes were awkward, cautious. But then it happened. Memories, laughter, old wounds finally able to heal.  

We talked about everything. About how great our relationship had been, how it consumed us back then, how close we were,almost frighteningly so. She, a Scorpio. Intense, deep, passionate. Me, a Capricorn. Rational, determined, but sometimes too closed off. About how, after the breakup, I sought comfort elsewhere, and how it hurt both of us. I regretted it. Truly. And even though she had every right to hate me, there was no bitterness in her. It was strange,that feeling when someone you once loved more than anything no longer needs you.  

The sex between us had been incredible. Unrestrained, passionate, real. The kind you never forget, whether you want to or not. And maybe that’s what kept us tied together longer than was healthy. But now, we just shook hands, like two people who once shared more than most do and who, in the end, managed to forgive each other. And yet, we remained friends.  

We said goodbye outside.  

she said,: ""I'm glad we talked this through,""  

I said: ""Me too. Really.""  

She walked away, her silhouette fading into the crowd. I was glad she was happy. Maybe for the first time in a long while, I felt no bitterness, only gratitude. For her, for what we had. And for the fact that we could finally let it go.

But as I stood there, watching the place where she had disappeared, one thought lingered, can you ever truly let go of someone who once meant everything?",6,1739351210.0,capricorns,3,0.87,False
1inmwv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1inmwv6/i_tried_switching_to_matcha_as_a_way_to_taper_off/,I tried switching to matcha as a way to taper off caffeine,"In recent years I have tried three methods to quit caffeine:
1. Cold turkey
2. Tapering with coffee
3. Tapering by switching from coffee to matcha to no caffeine at all.

Results: 

First time I quit i did cold turkey because I’m impatient and thought it’s better for me to endure quick intense pain than prolonged mild to moderate suffering. And yes it worked, and yes it was very painful first weeks. And yes of course after a year of being caff free I relapsed but that’s another story lol.

Second time I tried tapering with coffee and as I said because I’m impatient and because I still experienced quite awful withdrawal symptoms I didn’t manage to follow through and was back to full caff in no time. However, I can see how for many people it might be the best method.

Third time I tried tapering by switching to matcha and during first days I tried to match my usual caffeine dose from coffee although it’s difficult because caffeine amount in matcha varies greatly. Anyways, I tried 2tsp of matcha three times per day instead of my three cups of daily coffee and it worked. Now, caffeine from matcha works very differently and in my case I felt much smoother and longer albeit milder “high” from matcha and most importantly I didn’t crash horribly after few hours as was the case with coffee. Over the course of one week I reduced the amount of matcha and practically didn’t have any withdrawal symptoms. Too good to be true, I thought at first, but I still feel good after a month of quitting.

Again, everbody’s biology is different but I found that possibly the L-theanine and other stuff in matcha helped somehow with the withdrawal symptoms plus my usual daily horrible crashes and irritation disappeared almost immediately after the switch because of the slow and steady wave-like release of caffeine in case of matcha. 

Alhough basically the reasons for quitting caffeine were already gone after switching to matcha, I knew I had to drop caffeine entirely because it’s very easy to go back to coffee (and energy drinks) again when consuming tea daily because there are days when you miss the faster and stronger “high” that tea simply can’t provide.

PS! I think that getting the dose of matcha right during the first days after switching is crucial so that the caffeine intake from matcha would be more or less the same as your usual intake and probably the only way to achieve this is simple trial and error.",1,1739351188.0,decaf,4,0.67,False

Yayyy","Let me tell yall something yall may not know lol but honestly there are more drugs in prison then they are in the street so DB def may get to use drugs but he’ll have to sell his CHEEKS or lunch tray to get em being as tho he doesn’t have much . Eventually when Dawn Woods passes away (however God deems) that’s where his commissary ends. She can probably sustain sending him $100 every month and him only being entitled to $50 (due to the restrictions for restitution which I believe he should pay every penny of before he gets anything like my girl Susie Da Choppa said lol) cuz no one will let DB use their commissary # and if they do more than likely they will strong arm him and take what he orders. (FACTS).Honestly he deserves no commissary at all. He deserves no TV no games no nothing . But when I seen his jail cell search in Waukesha, I seen that his mom definitely sends him commissary money which is probably much easier on her then dealing with him in real life . He had the $25/$30 radio in his jail cell that’s on commissary and some coffee creamers that be on commissary. I know he wished he could stay in Waukesha jail but even though prison is easier and you have waaaaaay more freedom, free time and items, it won’t be easy for him at all because of his status. Sex Offender/ SNITCH/ Child Killer. Just understand people even criminals have rules and DB violates every single one. All three are looked at as the same level of punishment but in my eyes I’d say child killer, then sex offender then snitch. DB can’t stay in protective custody for ever because by law it is deemed inhumane so let’s all rejoice knowing every once in awhile (3/6 months) he will be punished atleast and sent back to PC and the cycle will continue. Now when you’re in PC for protective purposes you get to have commissary so honestly he’s probably watching his lil tv, eating snacks (we know that’s facts cuz of how big he is now), playing video games and listening to his radio etc etc. Yes you get all that in prison . Now when you’re in PC because of punishment, which PC now then becomes the HOLE, they take all your commissary and anything that may bring you some sort of pleasure. The best you may get is a book to read. The good thing is anytime DB is punished and he is stripped of his pleasures, he will have to reorder everything from TV, to video games etc because the inmates usually take all your stuff or the COz usually throw away all your stuff depending on your status(which DB is below 0). Trust me, DB would rather serve his time in Waukesha because prison definitely makes your time faster and you get to live like a regular person. But the problem is the inmates run the decks. The COz only come on the deck 2/3 times a day to do count. Count is the only time you have to lock in in prison and also bedtime. That’s why it’s easy to unalive inmates or do things to anyone without the COz noticing until count.  Or if you can reach the emergency button in each room which I doubt inmates would let DB hit, and even if he does you can just say it was on accident. They don’t care trust me. They’re the ones bringing in the cell phones and drugs and female COz be charging inmates for sex. That’s prison for yall .",3,1739351058.0,DarrellBrooksJr,2,1.0,False

1inmtir,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1inmtir/brain_melting_from_noisy_neighbors/,Brain Melting from Noisy Neighbors,"To preface, not looking for medical advice. Just want to vent a moment. 

I suffer from 'chronic insomnia', which I think means more than three instances of insomnia a week. I think most folks here would fall under that category. I tend to find sleep 20-36 hours after waking up, regardless of how much rest I might get. During bad stints I might be unable to get sleep for 2-3 days at a time. 

However, with medication and some basic 'sleep hygiene' ( basically no sugar or caffeine about 10 hours before Id like to sleep ) and therapy Im typically not awake for more than 36 hours at a time. Its taken over a decade and some change to get to this point. 

About three months ago new neighbors moved in upstairs. Every bit of that progress is gone. 

Small note but it's important, I have three layers of blackout curtains over my windows. I have a fan closeby that gives a consistent hum of white noise. 

I have the perfect layering of blankets to be comfortable for as long as possible, Ive invested in a few good pillows too. My sleeping space is as perfect as I can make it. 

But about every six hours it sounds like someone's being murdered upstairs. 

Here's the rub. The upstairs folks have two big dogs, one of which is very violent and unable to be outside without lunging/snarling at people and animals. They also have two kids, and the parents. That's four people and two dogs in a small three bedroom setup. A good deal of square footage is lost on a stupidly large hallway bathroom. 

When the dogs want to go out there's slamming and barking. Daddy dearest walks like he has two brick feet and SLAMS stuff all the time. Doors? Slammed. Coffee mug? Slammed. Gotta piss at 3am? Let's slam the bathroom door and stomp around like a toddler. 

We had zero issues with the prior tenants, and we've lived under all sorts of people for the past ten-ish years. This is the first time this issue has arisen and I'm losing my mind. 

Before they moved in I could escape the brain fog for a good  chunk of time. I could get some eight, ten, and twelve hour long rests with some bad fours and fives thrown in there. But I'd done the work, I wasn't 'cured' of my insomnia but I was improving. 

In the past few months I haven't gotten more than eight hours of sleep. Im averaging between four and six hours, without any big ten or twelve hour konk-out sessions. 

Now I have to put in earplugs and an ear covering that can also wake me up if I roll over wrong. 

Im back in the brain fog and I hate it. Hours slip by like water through my fingers. My mood is tanked again, Im always jumpy because who knows when the next SLAM is going to go off. Noise complaints have had no effect. Our floors are, to note, very well insulated and thick. So they are especially noisy. You can tell the difference between who's walking because you'll sometimes hear normal walking noises, like slight creaks above. Then the Dad Man stomps his way around from the bedroom to the bathroom, then the kitchen. Then back into what I assume is the kids room, back to the kitchen. Then to the bedroom. Then sometimes out the front door to walk one of the dogs at a time. 

I'm typing all this with strained-open, raw eyes. A dull throbbing brain fog. And little hope of finding good rest any year soon. I don't know what to do at this point. Do we just move? Do I need better earplugs? Is there something I haven't tried yet? 

The front office cant give less of a shit and I dont want to start a feud with baby-in-chief above me. The few times I tried to strike up conversation he pretended he couldn't understand me. Sorta stared at me slack jawed drawling "" Whut "" until I walked away.

Which host responded surprised and said the house was not ready and she was 45 min away and it would take 2 hours to get ready. Making our check in at 7 pm. I should’ve requested a cancellation but didn’t. 

This was an expensive place $380 a night where everything else in the area is about $80-$120 but no water access The place has a solid 5 star. 

Anyway we finally check in and go bring our few items inside. Open the fridge to put our water and fruit in and find a fridge full of stuff. A gallon of milk ( not unusual for NZ) but this was opened and used. Everything in the fridge was opened : cheese, mayos, hot sauce, coffee,etc. 

The pantry full of half eaten items: cereal, crackers etc. 


Bathroom: toothbrushes and other personal items ( in the drawer where the hairdryer is located and medicine cabinet)  The house is overall clean the bathrooms as well. It just feels like im crashing in someone’s home vs staying in a holiday home. I needed a blanket and she directed me to the closet when I opened the door a ton of shit fell out. The blankets were def not clean so I left them there. 

I am conflicted about it. She has 5 stays and give 5 star rating. Some people even thanking her for all the pantry and fridge stuff.

I am the mom of a 24 month old girl who I highly suspect she is on the mild side of the spectrum. I live in the Uk and we don’t have levels here . 
She doesn’t have issues communicating her needs and can answer what’s,  where’s , who’s simple questions . She has good joint attention and good receptive and expressive language for a 2 year old . She can put 2/3 words together that are spontaneous. 
She sleeps like a champ and rarely has a tantrum ( if she does it doesn’t last more than 10 minutes ) . 

Understands “Come here” and “Sit down”
• Identifies several body parts
• Follows one-step commands during play
• Understands some early prepositions she understands on )
• Finds familiar objects not in sight
• Chooses familiar objects from a group on request
• Understands familiar action words
• Attends to and identifies familiar pictures

What has concerned me for a while now it’s the following list . 
- Always the need to carry objects in her hand 
- She doesn’t like dirt on hands but doesn’t mind playing with mud and sand 
- Struggling in social settings like coffee shops , she shakes and gets excited and doesn’t stay still 
- Struggles with cutlery and  on the very picky side 
- Anxious around her peers but tries to fit in a very awkward way 
- When meeting a new person she starts using jargon and singing nursery rhymes. 
- Toe walking that has been going for 12 months now 
- She uses some delayed echolalia to greet her dad . Example : there used to be a little hole in her cot and her dad would say to her “where’s the hole “ for a couple of times and yesterday she greeted him with “ where’s the hole “ question . 

Now , I have expresses these concerns with the GP and HV on multiple occasions . In November , the HV put a referral for the community paediatrician forward and a couple of weeks ago we got a text saying that our application was rejected on the basis that’s this is typical development and we should continue to expose her to social settings . 
My hands are tied at the moment short of going private as I am the only one who thinks this is atypical . It is causing a lot of friction with my husband and family and I am starting to doubt my own mind . 
I realise she is very young but I’d like to hear from any parents who can give me any advice or point me in the right direction ☺️. ",1,1739348661.0,Autism_Parenting,0,1.0,False

There’s a drive thru without dedicated lanes resulting in blocked in parked cars. I entered my car with intent to leave and a car in the drive thru line, rather than waiting, pulled up when the line moved resulting in blocking me.

My action: To my left are 3 empty parking spots.  I pull a 3 pt turn, slowly pulling back toward the car behind me to simply give me turning space.  I use the 3 spaces to my left to then swing around and leave the lot.

Reaction from car behind me:  Continual honking as if I don’t see her despite my cautious/slow back up to ensure she has at least 1.5-2 ft of space.  As I executed the forward, left swing into the empty spaces, she proceeds to zip up as if to block me and flip me off.  Lucky for me, the end spot had open space for me to leave despite her attempt to make it clear she’d rather I wait for the line behind me to find a kind soul to yield and let me out.

I can draw a diagram if needed.  AITA for making a non-standard exit from my parking spot?

1inm8p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/1inm8p6/cbd_damn/,CBD - damn?,"I'm a walking talking firepit, if you're cold, I'm your guy. Or if you like immense amounts of sweat.

But this changed yesterday, when I tried smoking CBD. Cannabis with only 0.02/0.2% or less THC - not intoxicating.

THC is one of the cannabinoids/substances in cannabis that's responsible for making you high. Can often be associated with anxiety, paranoia, etc.. 

Here's how it went:

I went to a store, not looking for this, but I stumbled upon it and it smelled great. Just CBD flower, mind you I'm not condoning use of any illicit substances, to be fair, THC actually makes it worse for me 7/10 times.

Yesterday I rolled up a joint(not that it has to be smoked, at all) and I started feeling cold, and the tension I typically have in my hands and feet were slowly transforming into jelly in a non-intoxicating way. The tension was eventually gone, turning to relaxation.

For a decade or almost two I've never said: I feel cold. Despite living in a place where it SNOWS when it snows, and it's cold as hell when it's winter, at least to normal people. But I did, and I didn't sweat for the rest of the day(it was like 7-8pm, I try to sleep early)

It's definitely recommended, and as it's legal in the most common places, I don't see why I shouldn't spread the word. If it could become handy for someone to manage their symptoms, it'd just be amazing.

I've spent so many days of my life researching this, Oxybutinin, iso, Botox, alu, you name it. If you know, you know.

Wondering why CBD hasn't struck my mind as I'm a semi-retired stoner. For stoners with this issue, if THC doesn't help you, I strongly suggest to put less in the grinder next time.

Notice:

If you smoke spliffs/mixed with nicotine in whatever shape and form, don't. I've yet to see somebody with nicotine use/abuse have relief of mentioned symptoms, most likely the same case as with caffeine, increased nervousness or due to the fact itself that they're both stimulants. Mix all that together as a normal person would(morning cig, coffee, who knows what else) and you'll be regretting it later.",2,1739348066.0,Hyperhidrosis,2,1.0,False
