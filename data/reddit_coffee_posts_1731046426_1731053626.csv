Long story short, after coming out, I met a girl who works as a barista at my local coffee shop. We locked eyes the first few times we met. It’s been about four months since then. Around a month and a half in, after several visits and some strong eye contact, I started going there regularly for my morning takeaway. We built a rapport and started talking over time. I decided to follow her on Instagram, and she followed me back right away. Recently, she liked one of my stories, which made me think it might be time to take the next step.

I can’t ask her out at her workplace for obvious reasons, so I’m considering doing it online, as she’s active there. I’m not 100% sure she’s single—though she’s never mentioned being in a relationship and has hinted that she is single—but I’ll never know for sure unless I ask. However, she’s been reciprocating the connection, and we’ve built a comfort with each other that seems to be growing.

I haven’t done this kind of direct approach before, and I keep overthinking whether I’ve misinterpreted things. Any advice on how to approach this or on overcoming the nervousness?",1,1731053412.0,latebloomerlesbians,0,1.0,False
1gmdnph,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/1gmdnph/aitbf_for_getting_the_party_cancelled/,Aitbf for getting the party cancelled ,"

Background: me (41f) last January marked my 10 years at my company in a small accounting office. We generally get cake on our birthdays and for some occasions and we'll sit together and eat it. When my 10 came up my boss told me I would get a cake and celebrate. But nothing ever happened, and no one mentioned it at all after that. Which is whatever but why go out of your way to bring it up and then not do anything or tell anyone? I never said anything about it and just let it go. 

Another background some companies do what's called corporate challenge which is just different companies playing sports against each other for 1 day per sport (kickball, softball, bowling etc) and a woman in my office played in like 6 of 14 sports so she was the MVP. Got put in the company newsletter. Cool for her right.

So today I come in and I'm told we're doing cake to celebrate her for that. And it really upset me because I worked here for 10 years and get nothing, she plays in a few games and we do a thing for her? Don't get me wrong I'm happy for her but I just felt so...I guess unappreciated is the word. I got upset, it made me feel like shit. So I go in the break room for coffee and someone noticed I was upset. I said ""yeah sorry I'm just really upset, makes me feel like shit that we're doing cake for her but for my 10 years I didn't even get a congrats from anyone."" And I went back to my desk. Apparently word got around and she just got the cake at her desk and we didn't sit together to eat it. So it kinda got cancelled, because I was upset. But I wasn't trying to get it cancelled I was conveying how I felt. I didn't want to take away her celebration I wanted recognition too. So AITA?",1,1731053280.0,AmItheButtface,0,1.0,False

I still feel deeply confused about everything. My husband seems to be devastated by all this, but he has continued to trigger me over and over again by withholding information and lying about ""telling me everything."" He told me they had sex and other big details but there was so much more he didn't share and it felt like he was not planning to until I kept snooping and pushing him. I begged and begged for the truth and told him withholding/lying will only hurt more. He said he couldn't bare what he was putting me through and didn't want to hurt me more or risk me walking away. I told him he's full of it and only continued to lie to protect himself. He agreed and still kept further details about the affair. 

It finally feels like he is providing true radical honesty. I wish I didn't have to fight tooth and nail to get it but here we are. I still feel insanely confused about where things stand. I am moving out, that hasn't changed but i cannot stop contacting him. I text and call him daily, i have seen him multiple times since i told him to leave and although we have not kissed or been intimate, i do sit there and weep in his arms. I hate myself for it sometimes, why do I want him to hold me like this when he is the one putting me through hell. I know my feelings aren't going to just disappear but I don't want to want him. I have also had moments where I really want to slap him and do all i can not to. 

I sleep like shit, barely eat, can't focused, have done less than the bare minimum at work, can't find motivation to do anything but spiral and contact him. When he's around I have moments of peace like everything is normal but then something sets me off and i am crying, angry and in disbelief again. 

He has an affair of about 6 months, started out emotional and very much was a dating/courting phase although mainly limited to work but they would talk in the office, go grab a coffee and he gave her rides home for the second half of the affair 2 to 3 times a week, essentially when he was in office. Things turned intimate about 1.5 months before DDay. He started to feel some regret after their last sexual encounter and had a STD scare and was compelled to tell me because he tested positive for something. Even the day before he told me, he told her he was going to come clean and did not end the affair and gave her a ride home still that day. He said he was on autopilot and didn't say much to her on the car ride there but mentioned again he was going to tell me. 

Those are some of the new details I have discovered. I felt so gutted each time he revealed new information, more in shock that he could be capable of this. He said there has been zero contact since that day before he told me although she texted that morning after i messaged her but said he simply deleted it and did not want to engage. I asked him today to officially break things off with her since he never actually did. I don't care if they haven't talked, if he is really sorry and remorseful he should make it clear to her and he did text her and blocked her again after.

He says he has a sickness inside of him and doesn't fully understand why this happened, although he admits to low self esteem, looking for outside validation about our relationship problems, escapism, etc. He said he's going to do right by himself and me and won't give up. It pains me to accept this is over, i really don't want it to be. I do really love him and believe we could have a great life together but then how did we end up here? Can i ever truly forgive him. I want to be with him, that is how I truly feel and it's painful to admit.

I have never believed this is something I could get past, I still don't believe it. I just also know it hurts to think about life without him. 

Almost 2 weeks later, i know it's still fresh and i know i am very much still processing. I don't trust anything, not even myself and it's a really hard place to be in. ",1,1731052938.0,survivinginfidelity,1,1.0,False
1gmdkgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1gmdkgm/fitspresso_review_can_coffee_really_help_you_lose/,FitSpresso Review: Can Coffee Really Help You Lose Weight?,"Alright, so I came across something recently that I thought sounded almost too good to be true—a coffee that supposedly helps with weight loss. I’ve seen plenty of things promising easy results, but this one caught my attention because, well, I drink coffee every day anyway. So, I figured, why not look into it? Enter FitSpresso, a coffee blend that’s getting a lot of talk in the weight loss community. Here’s a deep dive into my experience and whether FitSpresso lives up to the buzz.

# What is FitSpresso?

FitSpresso is a coffee product marketed as a way to help people lose weight. Unlike regular coffee, which many of us drink for energy, FitSpresso claims to target **metabolism and fat burning**. The idea is simple: by just replacing your usual coffee with FitSpresso, you can kickstart your body’s natural ability to burn fat. It’s supposed to act as a “coffee diet” that works with your routine rather than against it. No drastic changes, no crazy workouts—just a swap in your daily caffeine intake.

I was skeptical at first because I know coffee alone isn’t some magic solution. But FitSpresso contains a specific blend of ingredients meant to support weight loss and energy levels. So, I thought, let’s try it out and see if there’s anything to this “coffee loophole diet.”

# My First Impressions of FitSpresso ☕

When I received FitSpresso, the first thing I noticed was the packaging. It’s sleek and definitely makes you feel like it’s something special. The coffee itself smells pretty much like regular coffee, maybe a little stronger and richer. I was curious about the taste because, honestly, if it tasted weird, I knew I wouldn’t stick with it.

Surprisingly, it tasted just like a good cup of coffee. I didn’t feel like I was forcing anything down, which was a huge plus. I enjoy a cup in the morning, so this felt like I was just drinking my regular coffee but with a potential bonus effect. **After about a week**, I started noticing that I wasn’t as hungry between meals, and I had a bit more energy throughout the day. Could be placebo, could be something real—at this point, I wasn’t sure, but I kept going with it.

[**Here’s the FitSpresso link for anyone curious to check it out themselves.**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/26FG9TK3/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST&rotate_uid=1)

# How Does FitSpresso Actually Work?

So, what’s the science behind FitSpresso? From what I read, it’s all about a combination of metabolism-boosting and fat-burning ingredients that are naturally found in certain types of coffee and supplements. FitSpresso contains compounds that are supposed to increase thermogenesis, which is basically your body’s way of generating heat and burning calories. By adding these specific compounds to coffee, FitSpresso aims to make your morning brew work double-time for you.

What I liked was that it wasn’t loaded with artificial stuff. FitSpresso focuses on natural ingredients, which was reassuring for me because I try to avoid things with too many synthetic additives.

I didn’t go into it thinking it would work miracles, but I was hoping for some positive effects on my energy and appetite. 

Alright, so here’s the real question—did it work? After a month of drinking FitSpresso daily, here’s what I noticed:

1. **Increased Energy**: I felt a steady increase in energy levels, particularly in the mornings and mid-day. I didn’t have those late-morning crashes as much, which was a big plus.
2. **Appetite Control**: I found myself feeling less hungry between meals. I’m usually a big snacker, so this surprised me. I didn’t feel the need to reach for snacks as often, which naturally led to me consuming fewer calories.
3. **No Jitters**: One thing I was worried about was feeling jittery or overstimulated, but that wasn’t an issue. The caffeine in FitSpresso didn’t feel overly strong, and I didn’t experience any nervous energy.

After the month, I hadn’t lost a massive amount of weight, but I did see a small change on the scale. I think FitSpresso is more of a helpful tool rather than a miracle solution. If you’re looking for something to give you a little extra support in your weight loss efforts, it seems to do what it claims in a natural and manageable way.

One thing I appreciated was that I didn’t feel like I had to overhaul my whole lifestyle. The **FitSpresso coffee diet** fit right into my routine. It felt sustainable and something I could see myself continuing.

# Would I Recommend FitSpresso?

Overall, I’d say FitSpresso is worth a try if you’re someone who drinks coffee regularly and wants an easy way to support your weight goals. It’s not going to give you instant results, but it feels like a nice addition that could help keep you on track. FitSpresso might be especially helpful if you’re trying to cut back on snacking, as it seemed to help with appetite control.

Also, if you’re already on a diet or workout plan, this could be an extra boost without feeling like another chore. Drinking coffee is already a part of many people’s routines, so switching to FitSpresso doesn’t feel like a huge commitment.

# Final Thoughts

FitSpresso isn’t magic, but it does seem to offer a realistic way to support weight loss without drastically changing your life. I’d say the **coffee loophole diet** concept is an interesting one, and FitSpresso does a pretty good job of making it easy to try out. If you’re a coffee lover like me and looking for a simple way to add some support to your weight loss goals, FitSpresso could be worth a shot.",1,1731052883.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

Back before net wrap on round bales a local mayor in a small town was a custom hay baler. Bales took a while to get string on them so an operator had time to take a drink. This guy went and did a small 20 acre job on a Friday afternoon. The customer the next day at the coffee shop was kinda upset saying he always thought this guy was a real honest man being mayor and all. Could not believe he would cheat him. People got to asking him why he thought he was cheated.  Said all the hay was stacked up when he went to check on the hay but he counted 30 beer cans on the outside of the bales. He just knew the  guy baled the road ditch somewhere and swapped the bales out cause he knew he didn’t have any cans in his field.  Turns out the guy would drink a beer while he was baling finish it while it was tying and throw the can out the window.  So the can would be sucked up on the outside of the bale for everyone to see. After this he made sure to throw the can out at the start of the bale. ",2,1731052579.0,farming,0,1.0,False

1gmdeei,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepTokenTheory/comments/1gmdeei/pov_you_see_vessel_in_lyon_unmasked_lsb_inspired/,POV: You See Vessel in Lyon Unmasked (LSB inspired short story) ,"I laid in despair, focused on the ceiling of my 9th floor coliseum tower room. Some palace, I thought to myself. What was it Kanye said?

‘Come home, girl, you know you can’t Rome without Caesar’.

After my Kanye-fueled stream of consciousness, I limped my raisin-y, hungover, thinning frame to the American Cafe in the lobby of the palace to have a vanilla latte and croissant. I found a spot at the bar and tremulously settled into a chair. I laughed to the bartender as I hunched over my coffee about how shitty I felt in mind, body, and soul. Was every day a new and deeper rock bottom?

I finished the latte and croissant, thanked the bartender, and decided to explored the palace, since I was stranded. I found the spa, gym, and the Venus Gardens, where I had asked Vessel to meet me the night before through Instagram DMs, to which he replied, 

‘You need to have a VIP meet & greet ticket.’

I had never heard of such a thing, and was naturally devastated, thusly resulting in drowning my sorrows with copious amounts of alcohol, assuming the VIP ticket did not exist, calling Vessel ‘such an asshole’, and getting myself thrown out of a nightclub for bullying the bouncer. 😌

I walked mindfully through the garden again, taking note of the koi pond and lily pads, bumble bees, trailing ivy, granite pews, and sparkling fountains in the center of the pool surrounded by chaise lounges and napping couples.

Things were starting to feel not like hell.

After going back to the garden, I spent an hour sweating out the alcohol and demons at the gym, feeling clear-headed for the first time since arriving to such a god-forsaken place.

I strolled past the cafe again, the casino, the bar, and approached the lobby of the coliseum tower, only to be caught off-guard by the glittering, flickering studio lights over my head.

I looked up at the lights, amused and reminded of this happening in a boutique, just the day before, only in a different building.

‘How does this keep happening?’ I pondered.

What I saw next, however grandiose it may seem, was perhaps the most shocking and unbelievable moment of my entire life.

After pondering the tumbling lights for a moment, I walked past the pillars to the entrance of the tower elevators, which were adorned with flecks of gold, art deco lining, and mirrors along the far wall and elevator doors. I looked at all of this, admiring the architecture and decadence, and was then frozen solid.

To the left of the pillars at the center elevator entrance stood Vessel, facing the mirrored wall.
He was the most elegant, sharp, stunning presence I had ever seen. I had only before then caught glimpses of him in candid photos as a young adult, and nothing prepared me for who stood before me now. I first noticed how his shoes reflected the flickering light, shiny and black against the muted charcoal of his dress pants and matching sport coat. He was so tall, about 6’4 at least, towering gently over a family of shorter statured people filling the space between us. He stood casually and appeared to be scrolling through his phone, waiting for someone. His phone, although probably the same size as mine, looked tiny in comparison to his giant hands.

His hair, sandy brown, straight, short on the sides, and falling forward ever-so slightly on top, startled me with its similarity to my own hair color. I hadn’t noticed this in the few photos of him available online. I laughed at the notion that one could mistake us for siblings if I weren’t 1.5 feet shorter than him and American. After taking in this vision in a state of cardiogenic shock for what felt like 0.005 seconds and all of eternity simultaneously, I felt the blood drain from my extremities as I realized how bad I must’ve looked in comparison. 

I was still sweaty, sporting a white baseball cap, a sports bra without a shirt, bicycle shorts, and no makeup with frizzy, sweaty hair tucked messily into my hat and headphones.

I panicked and mumbled to myself the only words I could muster,

‘Are these lights flickering??’

I then failed at walking without malfunction immediately upon trying to move from where my feet were frozen. I felt my left ankle twist and give way beneath me, praying he didn’t notice or know I was even there. I slipped past him to the right wall of elevators, utilizing the short family mentioned previously as my cover, and sunk into the back of the crowded elevator. Fumbling my phone, I quickly messaged Vessel, 

‘If that was you, I’m going to take a shower’

He, of course, did not respond until the following day, when he and his band were on to the next city for their tour. I felt the voice in my soul scream for mercy, and accepted the tomb in which my great love story sealed itself, at the base of the Hotel lobby near the Room Service help desk. 

In my defeat and after 2 more days of failed attempts at booking a flight home, I also caught a cold. In retrospect, however, Lyon seemed to have a plan to convince me to fling myself from the top of the hotel, so perhaps defeat is a strong word. Epilogue might be appropriate after all.

1gmddxy,https://i.redd.it/ztz1p8wmumzd1.jpeg,Constructive criticism: What the Dems did wrong,"Now that I’ve had time to process the election, a few thoughts. Obviously, I’m disappointed in the verdict of the American people. But, for a democracy to work, you have to accept that your candidate won’t always win. There has been plenty of frustrations voiced about how the American people voted, and I have nothing to add to the subject that you haven’t already read. 

A few random thoughts: I’m not a fan of the way Harris staffers are throwing Biden under the bus to the press. Should he have dropped out earlier? With the benefit of hindsight, yes. But I’m sure Biden thought he would perform a lot better on the debate stage than he did. And none of us had “Trump getting shot” on our 2024 bingo cards. 

Say what you will about Biden’s policies and presidency, but people on both sides of the aisle say he’s a fundamentally decent man who devoted 50+ years of his life to public service. He committed a selfless act of patriotism and deserved a better end to his career than tire marks on his back.

Like JFK once said, victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan. 100+ days is plenty of time to run a presidential campaign. Most people don’t even start paying attention until after Labor Day. If you are a former presidential candidate who holds the second-highest office in the land, you should already have a vision for America that you can easily articulate and sell. The problem wasn’t that there wasn’t enough time. The problem was that the Harris team did a poor job with the time they had. 

There is no reason it should have taken weeks to get a single policy position on the Harris campaign website, for example. This is a common mistake Democrats make. They waste way too much time focus group testing and (over)analyzing policy and messaging. 

As someone who shapes public opinion for a living, I’ll let you in on a little secret — most people have no idea what the heck they want, until you show them. Stand for what you believe in, and sell it to the American people. If you have a viewpoint that’s unpopular, so what? Make it popular. You believe in it for a reason. Get others to believe, too.

Americans will vote for people they disagree with on certain issues. What they wont do is vote for candidates who appear to lack courage in their convictions. Americans like leaders with guts.

The party would have benefited from an open convention in which candidates could make their cases to the delegates — and, more importantly, the American public watching at home — for why they should be the Democratic nominee. If that candidate turned out to be Kamala, great. If not, that’s great too. In any case, there should have been an open and transparent process in which the American people felt that they had a voice. There are few things that frustrate people more than feeling unheard.

And here’s one thing that everyone got wrong, including me. Being “not Trump” just wasn’t enough this time around. It *was* enough in 2020. Americans were just coming out of a year in which Trump bungled a pandemic so bad that 1,000,000+ people died — including two friends of mine who did everything right. 

But Americans have the attention spans of gnats. No one remembers that they were wiping their hindquarters with coffee filters four years ago. They do remember that eggs cost a buck more last week than they did back in the “good ol’ days.”

Trump is a polarizing figure who has been in the forefront of American politics for nearly a decade now. People have made up their minds about him. There needed to be a stronger case made for why Harris *should* be president, not why Trump shouldn’t. The case against Trump had already been litigated ad nauseam.

In you’re still with me, thank you for reading my self-therapeutic ramblings. Just like eight years ago, I will give Trump a clean slate on January 20, and he will have my support until he does something to lose it. I hope it takes a lot longer this time.

1gmd8s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1gmd8s9/advice_please/,Advice please,"So, I have had a few endoscopies over the last decade as part of the general checkups they offer where I live. Initially, I was told I had some mild chronic gastritis. A couple of years ago, this was still the case but the doctor said the stomach lining was thinning - though there wasn't much I could do about it and part of the aging process now I am in my 40s. My most recent one he said mild atrophic gastritis and did an H Pylori test which was negative. But no tissue samples, just same general view.

So, while I have had occasional reflux associated with spicy food or meals too late at night, I have not done those things regularly and I am pretty sure my ""chronic gastritis"" has been asymptomatic. I am therefore confused as to why the stomach lining is thinning.

However, despite generally trying to eat healthy, I have been drinking 2-4 cups of coffee a day for years (even thinking it was good for a person) and a beer most evenings (occasional small whiskey after dinner). I had thought alcohol consumption needed to be higher to cause gastritis, but perhaps I am wrong - it's just that it doesn't cause negative symptoms. When I read about others avoiding these things they generally cite immediate flare-ups. I also take an SSRI daily for anxiety but not sure if that could be considered an irritant.

For what it's worth, I also have had two small colon polyps removed over the last decade, and I have an inflammatory polyp in my Terminal Ileum that the doctor says has become smaller. But it suggests perhaps some inflammation beyond the stomach. Again, no real symptoms aside from maybe some food poisoning type things years ago and not often.

I am prone to health anxiety, and probably stress generally, but can anyone offer any insight or general advice? To try to help my gastro system I have been taking Zinc L Carnosine and curcumin phytosome but I am shooting in the dark somewhat. I really want to not have stomach inflammation even if I can't feel it and I am prepared to make lifestyle changes - I am not sure whether I should just stop coffee and alcohol completely and do another endoscopy? Would green tea be a substitute for coffee even though tea also has caffeine? Or maybe just having coffee after food? Is it possible to accurately diagnose mild atrophic gastritis by sight on endoscopy? Are there other tests I could ask for, perhaps from a different doctor?",1,1731051446.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

Let's call her Julia. And from the beggining we had a blast together. I developed feelings for her, and started to make moves, which she did respond. We went on 2 dates. Everything was great as I presumed. Then we had a talk in which Julia asked if I like her, I said yes and asked her if she wants to start dating, she said that she sees me more like a friend. Then she said that she slept with her best friend's brother and they decided to date. She said that she surmised that I like her and she will understand if I won't want to talk to her anymore. I said that I need time to think. After all we had a great time together even as friends. And after couple of weeks of staying by myself and self-treating I decide to stay friends with her and we started just hang out as friends as we used before with the exeption that I started to keep my distance, and I said to her I will do it. Not gonna lie I still kept strong feelings for her, but just stopped to think that anything here will work out. 1 month later I met another girl and we started just chatting, going out together. I wasn't feeling much towards this girl (mostly I think because I still have feelings for Julia), but decide to still hang out with her, cause she was fun to spend time with. Meanwhile Julia broke with her boyfriend, as he turned to be an asshole. She started to text me more often, trying to flirt and sending me memes and pictures with sexual context. Eventually she asked me to meet me with a cup of coffee when she said that she made a mistake choosing the other guy, that she likes me but didn't realise it until recently and she wants to start dating if I still feel the same way. I told her that I need to think about it. And now I don't know how to act. I like her, I really do. And I wish her well. But I just can't start dating with her after what she did. I feel like spare airfield in her eyes as long as I think about it.

1gmctn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gmctn9/doing_research_has_made_me_feel_like_i_dont/,Doing research has made me feel like I don't belong here...,"Hey everyone, I just have to get this off my chest. I’m a senior, and I’ve been working in this lab for around a year now, but recently I got some unexpected news: my PI wants me to continue on as a PhD student under him. It’s the kind of thing that people dream about for years, right? Getting picked by a top researcher to lead your own projects? But the more I think about it, the more it feels like a joke, and I’m the punchline.

I didn’t exactly come into this program with a prestigious background. Before I transferred to Berkeley as a junior, I worked at my family’s noodle shop, spent most of my free time trying to make ends meet, and only started doing research in my junior year after transferring from community college. The fact that I’m even here feels like a fluke sometimes. I barely knew what a pipette was when I first started, and now I’m supposed to be leading cutting-edge research? How did I go from being just another student trying to figure out the basics to being given this major responsibility?

What really hurts is how this news has affected my relationship with my 5 other lab mates, who all got admitted as freshmen and have been working the lab much longer than I have. They have multiple publications, presented at major conferences, done internships at prestigious FAANG companies, and they all generally have their lives together. Meanwhile, I’m just sitting here hoping I don’t spill my coffee on the lab notebook or accidentally blow up the centrifuge. Every time I ask a question, it feels like I’m interrupting their flow. I feel like the awkward outsider who was accidentally allowed to stay after the tour. Somehow the news is out that I got selected to do the PhD. and they didn't, and they all seem to resent me for it. One of them even told me that I ""don't really belong here"", and I makes me just want to throw away everything I've worked for and all the opportunities I've been given and leave the lab. 

Up until now, I've tried my best to keep my head down, do my lab work, and try to learn something along the way. I’ve been given this huge responsibility, but it feels like no one actually thinks I’m up to the task. The Professor keeps talking about how he sees potential in me, but honestly, I have no idea what that potential is. He’s so calm and wise, like he’s always ten steps ahead of everyone else, and I’m just scrambling to keep up. He’s been here forever, while I’m just this... noodle shop kid with no real training. I’m pretty sure he’s just waiting for me to prove that I belong, but it feels like I’m the only one who hasn’t figured it out yet.

And don’t even get me started on my Postdoc advisor. He’s been tough, but fair, I guess. He doesn’t give a lot of praise, but when he does, it’s always about how I need to step up. I've noticed that he tends to play favorites  with the other undergrads, and now that he found out that I got selected for the PhD, he expects me to have become an expert overnight, while simultaneously telling me I'm not cut out for the job or how ""its not my destiny""...

I don’t feel ready. I don’t feel qualified. I’m just waiting for the moment when someone realizes I’m not the right person for the job. It feels like I just dropped into this situation as some kind of cosmic accident. When I talked to the Professor about how I feel, he simply smiled and told me that ""there are no accidents"". I know it’s an honor, but it doesn’t feel like it’s mine to take.

So now, I’m stuck here, doing my best to convince everyone (and myself) that I actually belong in this lab. I don’t want to be the one who lets everyone down, but every time I look at my peers, I feel like they’re so much more prepared than I am. They have their lives together. I have this huge project to manage, some advanced genome sequencer called *DRGN warRIOR*, and no idea how I'm supposed to be qualified enough to fulfill this destiny I have been given.

I don’t know if I’m ready, but I also don’t know how to get ready. Some days it feels like I’m just playing pretend.

I am searching for some shop with MacBook accessories, where I could find a real Mac enthusiast, who would not be surprised to see microSD card adapter (see the picture) and, ideally, would have one for sale. 

I am talking about only actual ground physical stores, not online of any kind. 

My previous post in this community led me to discovering all the best specialty coffee shops in your city and I am still recommending some of those to others :) So, I have a hope, that this time Hanoi Reddit community will work like a charm too!

Bit of back story, my boyfriend and I, have been together for just two months, I left a 9 year relationship, about a year ago, and my ex was emotionally abusive. 
My new boyfriend is a gentleman, treats me like a princess, talks to me with respect and does everything to help me around the house, etc. all in all, he's an amazing guy, but there's one place where he fails... Affection.

I personally believe that he is autistic, he has many traits of autism but is undiagnosed, please keep this in mind, when answering this question.

I've never been an overly clingy person, I'm very independent and I like my space, not a huge fan of being touched etc. but since meeting my boyfriend, I crave his touch a lot more, which is hard because he is not a fan of being touched. I try to respect this as much as possible, but sometimes, I just want a cuddle or a kiss, hell, I'd settle for him holding my hand! But he doesn't get it, I ask if he's coming to bed and he thinks I'm trying to force him to go to sleep, when in reality, it's the only time we are actually in close proximity, enough for me to get cuddles. Normally, he sits on the computer chair and I, on the sofa.

I've tried explaining that me asking him to come to bed, is just my way of having a bit of intimacy with him, but he doesn't seem to understand. Then when we are in bed, sometimes I will absentmindedly stroke his hair, arm or back, he hates it and says that I'm trying to bug him, I'm not, it's just things that I like people to do, to me, so I automatically do it to him.

There's also times where I try to give him a kiss on the cheek and he pulls away, telling me to stop being annoying! Like, last night for example, I'd been working on my PC for four hours straight, with my earphones in, during that time, he had been bringing me cups of coffee without being asked and leaving me to do my work, as he knows I don't like to be disturbed while working, after four ISH hours, he came over and tapped me on the shoulder, telling me that he had ran me a bath, as I'd been working so long and he felt that I needed a break, informed me that he had just ordered food, so I didn't have to cook and that my PJs were on the bed, waiting for me. 

Obviously, this is all very sweet, I said thank you, shut down my pc and went to head upstairs, but before I went, I leant down to give him a quick peck on the cheek, as a show of appreciation, he pulled away and said ""Lady, do not come and bug me, ive left you alone to work, please don't irritate me."" So I left it alone and got in the bath.

While laid in bed, later, I tried to kiss him and initiate some ""Spicy"" time, he chuckled and said ""I like your attempt, but no."" 
We haven't had any ""Spicy"" time in almost a month! I hate to say it, but we did it WAY MORE, before we were even in a relationship. He says that he doesn't want our relationship to rely, only on that, which is absolutely fine! But we've been dating TWO MONTHS and haven't done it, for one of them! 

I asked if he is even still into me, he said that of course he is, and that not a moment goes by, where he doesn't want to rip my clothes off, so I asked him, if that's the case, why don't you do it? 

He sighed and repeated ""I don't want the relationship to revolve around it."" But it's not even existent!

I'm no saint, before he and I were dating, I was having ""Spicy"" time, with multiple men and women, at least four times a week and I loved it, I said I'd never get into a relationship again, as I valued my freedom, far too much... But I fell for him and, here we are. But a part of me, really wishes I hadn't gotten into this, I feel like I'm just his room mate, and he doesn't even live here!

I have tried explaining all of this to him but nothing I say, seems to do the trick. 
I love him, he's an amazing man, but this lack of affection is breaking me and I don't know what to do about it.",1,1731049326.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

Bienvenu is from Decamé, in southern Benin, 55 km from Cotonou. It is in this country that Ouidah is located, the world headquarters of voodoo (vaudoun is its real name). It was there that the International Voodoo Festival was celebrated in February 1993 for seven days. It is from this city that voodoo spread all over America (and throughout the world). Decamé is considered to be the headquarters of witchcraft among the villages in the district of Ouidah just 22 km away. The village is located at the edge of a large lagoon of 15 km wide and 80 km long. It is also surrounded by a large forest divided into two parts, the second of which is reserved for agriculture, while the first part is reserved for late-night witchcraft practices. It is the meeting place of all the sorcerers of the village and even of the region.

There are large trees (iroko, baobab and the like) on which the sorcerers install all their diabolical armaments. When these trees fall due to a strong wind or rain, things like kitchen utensils, human skulls and more are found in their hollow trunks. But sorcerers also plant trees in the village which they use for their own profit. The same objects are also found in those trees when they are cut. In fact, these trees are inhabited by sorcerers. The dead are buried in huts, in houses or in the courtyards. Until today, the village has no cemetery. In the courtyards, hoes are arranged on the tombs. People sleep on tombs unbothered. This situation makes the inhabitants of the village constantly possessed, inhabited by the spirits of death. The village of Decamé is divided into three districts:

The first quarter worships a fetish based on two albinos, a woman and a man, buried alive in a big hole by the leaders of the said fetish. This fetish provides protection for this neighbourhood. It is considered to be the support of senior managers. Any leader who manages to find a job with the help of this fetish must thank him with a sheep, red oil, a bottle of gin, two litres of koutoukou (local alcoholic liquor of over 80°) and at least 50 000 FCFA. Every year this fetish demands the sacrifice of a child, a human being. 

The second quarter worships another fetish based on 41 human heads placed in a big hole. Its name is Zangbetô - Zangbetôh is broken down as follows: Zan = night, Gbetôh = fetish. So it's a night fetish. On the day of the Zangbetôh dance and miracle ceremony, the wearer of the mask, following the pronunciation of incantatory words, transforms into either a caiman, a hen and its chicks, or some other forms. Then he becomes a man again. He participates in the promotion of senior managers who adore him. But those who resort to his help end up badly. 

The third quarter is linked to a fetish built on a pregnant woman who was slaughtered in a big hole. Its followers go into a trance. On the day of the ceremony, they engage in terrible acts. This is an occasion where blood is shed in abundance: some can make cuts on their body with a knife. They can bang their heads against a brick wall, and so on. This fetish is supposed to help villagers and senior managers who put their trust in it.

Decamé has another dangerous fetish called Hèviosso or thunder. Its role is the destruction of thieves. When an object is stolen and the leaders of the said fetish are solicited, they implore thunder that will lead to the unveiling of the thief. The fetish acts during a torrential rainfall to strike the culprit. After the thief's funeral, the body is unearthed regardless of its state of decomposition. The leader of the fetish cuts the body with a knife, takes the head and keeps it in the fetish house. On the day of the fetish worship, he comes out with 16 skulls of his victims around his waist. This is his title of glory. This is proof that his fetish is powerful, that he has killed many criminals. Thus, satan gives his approval by punishing the culprit. My village is victim of a real demonic possession. In Décamé, 90% of children, young people, and leaders are deeply involved in witchcraft. What about my family environment?

[**1.1- My parents**]()

**Paternal great grandfather:** He was the greatest sorcerer in the region. He was born a sorcerer, in the first part of the forest. He is the one who imported the family fetish (wloivaudou) from another region of Benin. He used to inject people with diseases. He could turn into a wasp to destroy an entire village in case of dispute between two villages, inoculating a deadly poison with its bites. He remained a sorcerer until his death.

**Paternal grandfather:** He succeeded his father in the same witchcraft practices. In the army, he would turn into a fly on the battlefield. Because of this, he was promoted. But later, he was poisoned by one of his wives. He died a sorcerer.

**Father:** Megnanou Tchanon (Tchanon is a fetish name) spent seven years in a ""convent"", on the initiative of his father, to be initiated into witchcraft in order to become the leader of sorcerers. He needed that, although he was born a sorcerer. When he left the convent, he was appointed the head fetishist of the family. He communicated with demons. Note that the family had a house of fetishes that it nurtured. It is in this house that the convent is located. The family fetish, the wloivaudou, had many followers. After every 3 months, a young girl or boy is kidnapped from one of the member families to be trained in the convent. After three years, these young people go out and become followers of the fetish. My father had to deliver nine of his children (2 girls, 7 boys) to the convent. It must be said that these children die of a brief illness. Moreover, he himself died a sorcerer, after a brief illness, on May 26, 1996, after having repeatedly refused to accept Jesus Christ.

**Maternal great grandmother:** She was a great witch. She would kill people, and on the day of the funeral, she would come to sympathise with the grief of the grieving family. She died a witch after bequeathing the inheritance to our grandmother.

**Maternal grandmother:** Sorceress too, follower of the thunder fetish (Hêviosso). She engaged in the same witchcraft practices as her husband. She died a witch. It should be noted that all these sorcerers went to church.

**Mother:** She is still alive. May God save her!

  
When my mother was pregnant with me, she was confronted with a difficult situation. After the usual nine months, she still did not give birth to me. So she went to consult a marabout. The answer was terrible: I had to be given birth to after 14 months of pregnancy, in accordance with the wishes of my great-grandfather who was already dead. This is what happened. After 14 months, my mother gave birth to me at 1 am, on the grave of the latter. When I was born, I had two teeth in my mouth. To be born on a grave, allows the newborn baby, according to our beliefs, to have the power of the deceased. Also, according to my parents, I was to inherit this grandfather’s powers. At the age of five, I was not walking yet. I started walking when I was six. I was then enrolled in primary one. One night, my father took me to the forest, cut his skin and mine, collected our blood in the same glass and we drank the two mixed bloods. This was the blood pact. When he had to consult a client, he would wait for me to come home from school before starting work. He always wanted me to attend all sessions. This is how he introduced me to the different practices of witchcraft.

[**1.3- Student and sorcerer**]()

In primary school, when the teacher was preparing his exam, I would transform into a fly around 1 or 2am to go and see the exam paper. I did this until the final year of primary education. Thus, I easily succeeded in school without having to study. This is how I got into secondary school. In college, I used to bewitch teachers by causing headaches and stomach pains when I got poor grades - by poor grade, I mean 12/20. Once, the teacher had to go to a marabout to find out the cause of his pain. After consultation, he was told that he had offended one of his students. He made this revelation because marabouts, witchdoctors, sorcerers and others communicate by telepathy. Later, the demons inspired the teacher to know who he was talking about. So he came to me to ask for forgiveness. And I demanded that he rectify my marks by giving me 19/20. At about 1am, I invoked the spirits with incantatory words for him to obtain healing.

I also bewitched my classmates (those who were the brightest) either with chronic headaches or with stomach aches in order to hinder them from doing their homework. This happens in schools, at the university, without the knowledge of teachers, many students and pupils. This is one of the causes of school failures. At that time, Benin was shaken by political upheavals that affected schools. Students did not progress regularly. So, I decided to join my father who was already settled in Ivory Coast.

  
[**2- Installation, equipment and consultations**]()

 

Some moments after arriving in Ivory Coast, I was lodged by a personality of this country (director of the cabinet of a minister) in the commune of Abobo. He had lodged me in a big villa because I was his protector. Later, my host became a minister, by my care. But not for long. Because, as we will see later, the power of satan does not go far. It is for this reason that many of the authorities who have benefited from my care have died, others are paralysed or sick. In my luggage, I had an arsenal of fetishes. By my power, I crossed the three borders: Benin - Togo, Togo - Ghana, Ghana - Ivory Coast without being searched once by the security forces.

 

[**2.1- My initial equipment**]()

 

[**2.1.1- Human's jaw and bottle shards**]()

 

I had a fetish made up of a human's jaw, shards of bottles with another crushed element and a piece of loincloth that had been used to close the mouth of a corpse. This fetish allowed me to eliminate people from a distance. With this fetish, no matter what my client's job was, he could be sent on a mission or an internship. If there were people who bore him a grudge, all he had to do was to come to me and I would end their existence. This fetish also applies to jealous people who gave me the name of a person to eliminate. With my fetish, I would take off my shirt around 1am, make incantations by invoking the name of the jealous person or the person to eliminate. Then I would tie him up with the piece of loincloth. Once I shot at the loincloth, no matter where they were: in Europe, Asia or America, I could reach him. Seven drops of blood fell in my palm, proof that the blow was successful. In the morning, when he woke up, the victim began to feel burns in his body, as if lacerated by scraps of bottles. When he tried to move, he felt bites in his body. ***When an illness is caused by fetish, modern medicine, in spite of its prowess, will never succeed in detecting the cause***. The victim will die a week later.

 

[**2.1.2- Human's head and padlock**]()

 

This fetish's function was to make women barren. They could have their menstruation twice in the same month or have terrible stomach pains at any time. This is often due to rivalry in polygamous homes. The one who came to me, often had the desire to be loved by their common husband and to put the other wife far from him. I would ask her for an underwear of the co-wife to do this job. ***This is the reason why women lose their underwear in an astonishing way and later have painful menstrual periods***. This same fetish can cause epilepsy in some victims. Following the incantations, I invoked the name of the person targeted on this fetish and I locked the padlock. She was then automatically reached. In the morning, while she was preparing to go to the shower, she would collapse all alone and fall asleep. When she woke up, spittle would be coming out of her mouth.

 

[**2.1.3- Foot and padlock**]()

 

This fetish was used to paralyse the victim. Most often, jealousies in workplaces and companies caused this. Some people envying the superior position of their hierarchical leader came to me to destroy them. And when invocations were made from this fetish, the person targeted in the company was paralysed. He could be a chief accountant who was looking to become a CFO (Chief Financial Officer). If such a person came to see me, I would paralyse the CFO with this fetish, and my client would take his place.

 

[**2.1.4- Clay pot made up of human blood, water, ...**]()

 

This terrible fetish drove people mad. When someone came to see me just with the name of a person, around 1 am, I would strip to the waist, go to the clay pot and pronounce the name of this person, accompanied by incantatory words. I would then see his image in the clay pot and would pronounce other incantatory words. The next day, the person would take off his clothes and walk naked on the street. That person could also pull the bins over and eat his own excrement. Whatever incantation I pronounced on that person's name is what he will do.

 

[**2.1.5- Human heart**]()

 

The function of the fetish ""human heart"" was to make blind. It consists of a human heart. My human's heart, I got it in Nigeria. But even in Treichville (Treichville is one of the ten communes of Abidjan), in the years 77-78, in the barracks that were located at the current location of the SOTRA (Société de Transport Abidjanais), there was a traffic of human organs. Satan uses human organs to make powerful fetishes. This human's heart, I would burn it, accompanied by very hot small peppers and incantatory words, until it charred. I made a powder out of it. When a client sent me a photo of an unwanted person, I scraped that person's eyes with a needle and put the powder in it. When the person woke up, he would go blind. We usually see people who have their eyes open but do not see. Most often witchcraft has something to do with that. I destroyed a lot of people. They came to hire me from inside the country to go and cause harm.

 

[**2.1.6- Matchbox with padlock**]()

 

This fetish, accompanied by incantatory words, was used to burn down plantations, especially of coffee and cocoa. Driven by jealousy, people came to me to hurt others. When a jealous person came to me with all the requirements, I would go to his opponent's field, dig a hole in which I would put a matchstick. With the padlock, I prevented the proprietor, by mystical means, from coming to the plantation, and around noon the field would catch fire. I was at the origin of several bushfires. I ""helped"" a lot of plantation owners in this domain.

 

[**2.1.7- Fetish composed of ten human fingers wrapped** ]()**…**

 

This fetish had the property of causing death in villages. It allowed me to respond to the requests of several people in the Attié region (southern Ivory Coast). Some traders and beverage sellers came to me to ask for my services in this direction, because they found that their business flourished during funerals. Our contract stipulated that I take half of the profits they made at the funeral. In a village in Ivory Coast, the inhabitants had to consult another witchdoctor, to tell them of the existence of a fetish buried in their village, and to have it dug up in order to stop the slaughter. I buried this fetish in several other villages in the west, in the east, etc. People came to hire me from everywhere.

 

[**2.1.8- Fetish made up of a clay pot containing human blood, …**]()

 

This fetish has destroyed the lives of many young people and senior managers. When the name of a girl was invoked on this fetish, accompanied by incantatory words, she became frigid and could indulge in sex with more than ten men without being satisfied. With this same fetish, I got young people to indulge in alcohol and drugs. As for the senior managers targeted, they could earn 800 000 FCFA, 1 000 000 FCFA, but as soon as they received their money, they squandered it entirely. This fetish prevented them from carrying out their projects, pushing them to indulge in alcohol. Despite their salary, they became mediocre, unable to build any house in the village. That is how I destroyed the lives of senior executives. I did it of course at the request of my clients.

 

[**2.1.9- Telephone combined with fetish**]()

 

It was used to destroy the lives of people and homes. Once I got the phone number of the person I had to hurt, I called him with my handset unconnected but covered in human blood. As soon as he picked up, I would pronounce incantatory words, thereafter, he would have a high fever and death would follow. This, no matter where the target was.

 

[**2.2- Consultation**]()

 

Before consultation, I had a drink in a bottle containing a fetish made of human tongue wrapped in red percale sewn with cowries. It was in the form of a fist. These elements are introduced into the bottle from the bottom using incantatory words: the bottle opened after some words that I said, then it closed after other words pronounced. When I gave this drink to my clients, they were bewitched. They could now believe anything I said and execute everything I ordered them to do. All the clients who consulted me were bound to me for good, because of that spell. I had authority over their lives. So it is, with all the marabouts occultists I have known. The consultation fees were fixed at 660 FCFA plus one litre of koutoukou. Like many sorcerers, I used drinks like Royal Gin and Mangoustan Rhum. The consultations were done with four cowries to which the client spoke before dropping them down. The demons then revealed to me the customer's concerns. However, during the consultation, what I said was not always true, but the client's mind was controlled by the drink taken at the beginning of the session; he was bewitched. Also, he was at my mercy. He could even go into debt to meet my requirements.

 

[**2.3- Forbidden food items**]()

 

What I did to some of my clients was sometimes terrible. To some, I prescribed not to eat sheep, chicken, cassava, etc. To others, I ordered not to breathe when lifting up the clay pot containing their fetish. If they breathe, I told them, the fetish is worthless. As a result, they had to acquire another clay pot, which profits the witchdoctor. Can you imagine senior managers, business directors manipulated by a witchdoctor to the point that he tells them not to breathe while taking this or that medicine; or to put a clay pot on their head and go around their room seven times before bathing ... What a torture! Imagine directors, senior managers with clay pots on their heads!

 

Imagine that many people are living these things right now and you will understand how much they need Jesus Christ to be delivered. You see them in big Mercedes cars, but once at the witchdoctors, they become less than nothing. We got them undressed as though it were a joke. That is what it's like not having Jesus in your life. A man without Jesus Christ is really a slave.

 

[**3- The minister of satan and health**]()

 

[**3.1- Pregnancy blockage**]()

 

I had a fetish composed of a woman's kidneys, a padlock and another item. With this fetish, I blocked pregnancies in the womb of women for up to 15 months through the incantations I made. The woman who was targeted could not give birth. All it took was that her rival comes to me with one of her underwear and a piece of her loincloth for me to block her pregnancy. If she gets operated upon, the baby will be found dead in her womb, worse, she will not survive the operation.

 

[**3.2- Abortions**]()

 

Abortions are not the prerogative of doctors and midwives. Witchdoctors do them too. As far as I am concerned, aborting a month's pregnancy was just a child’s play. I only needed a bottle of gin, 20 000 FCFA plus a chicken that I gave to the fetish. I gave the client a drug consisting of a wine previously warmed up with the powder of a certain tree. I gave all these stuff in the form of beverage to the pregnant woman; she drank it. The next day she would have a fever and within one to three hours, the abortion was complete. Her menstruation resumed right away. Abortions of one-month to two-month pregnancy were simple; they were more complicated from three to six months.

 

Today, I appeal to all those women who continue to kill through abortions to come to their senses, because they will give an account to God. I remind them that they are now under the influence of demons. You need Jesus Christ to understand the gravity of the crimes you commit. I declare it to you, student, if you have sinned with a young man, and got pregnant and then you want to abort and kill the child, give up this idea and let the pregnancy take its normal course. Otherwise, God will hold you accountable. I also call on doctors, midwives who claim to help people to improve their situation, but who in reality earn their living by aborting women. Take note that what you are doing is witchcraft. Indeed, it is satan that inspires you. Know this, you will render an account for those children you have killed unless you accept Jesus Christ and get delivered from these satanic practices.

 

[**3.3- Lumps in the belly**]()

 

Women often suffer from stomach pains that are caused by witchcraft. As far as I am concerned, I had a bottle containing human blood and 20 grams of kidney. The incantatory words uttered on this bottle, with the name of the victim, caused illness. Most often, these women underwent surgery after which they got malaria, and they succumbed to it. By the same process, I bewitched women, which caused them to have a lump in the belly. The gynaecologist sometimes discovers a lump in the belly of some sterile women. This may be the result of witchcraft. Therefore, I appeal to women who have a lump of suspicious origin in the stomach: it is a terrible spell of sorcery. God did not bring us into the world to see us suffer from diseases. Sickness comes from satan, from the evil one. So you need Jesus Christ. He is the ideal solution to this problem.

 

[**3.4- Bloated belly (pregnant men!)**]()

 

When, driven by jealousy, people came to see me to destroy someone's life and gave me his name, I also had a fetish consisting of a padlock and a pig’s head with which I could bloat the belly of a man. Then he would keep losing weight. And that was possible thanks to incantations that I made around 1 am. I specify that this is the best time for sorcerers because they easily come into contact with spirits. To do this, I would strip naked and lock that person in that padlock. After a month or two, the victim started getting weird nausea. After three to four months, this man will go to the doctor because his belly size will be increasing from day to day. The tests will not reveal anything. Everything is in order, but he keeps losing weight. This is the sign that he has been bewitched. Despite the care he can receive from doctors, they will never be able to detect the problem. Through witchcraft, I sucked blood out of people's bodies so that they were always sick - with bloated stomachs. They are always anaemic. Others may look healthy, but are seriously ill because of witchcraft.

 

[**3.5- Epilepsy**]()

 

I had a fetish in a clay pot, consisting of dog drool mixed with some liquid. With these elements accompanied by incantatory words, I bewitched young people and struck them with an incurable epilepsy, which only Jesus Christ can cure them of.

 

[**3.6- Breast cancer**]()

 

Through witchcraft, I used to bewitch women into getting breast cancer. This resulted in the removal of one or both breasts.

 

[**3.7- Deaths in health centres**]()

 

After rendering a person sick, sorcerers go further by preventing his healing and then kill him. Sorcerers prevent the serum placed on the patient from entering his body. When the doctor or nurse places the serum, sorcerers come to block it so that the drug does not enter the body of the patient. Admittedly, the drops go down into the tube, but the patient receives nothing in his body. In fact, sorcerers suck these drops out of the patient's body. No matter how much the doctors administer serum to the patient, nothing enters the body or rather it has no effect. I practised these things. I used to turn into a fly and go into hospital wards. When the doctor or the nurse made every effort to treat the patient, I would confuse them to prevent them from properly diagnosing the disease. They wondered why the serum had no effect. They could not imagine that the drops of serum did not enter the body of the patient.

 

[**3.8- Healing of barren women and its consequences**]()

 

In my consultations, there were couples who came to see me, because of infertility. Very often, barrenness is caused by witchcraft. Sorcerers ""tie up"" women's belly or render men impotent. They then make you unable to have children. I cured this evil not without consequences, because the first child that my customers had was dedicated to demons. I urge you not to go to witch doctors to have a child. In Jesus Christ, there is everything you need. Certainly, we do not accept Jesus Christ for any gain, but He said in his Word to seek first the Kingdom and the righteousness of God and the rest will be added to you. Therefore, it is true that when we accept His Word and put it into practice, we are inundated with blessings.

 

[**4- Bewitchments**]()

 

I have helped women who have never been to school to become mistresses of great personalities. They charmed these men who even abandoned their homes in distress. But know that these mistresses eventually end up badly. At the beginning, they are fine: they drive big Mercedes and other popular cars. But their end is pitiful. If you have done these things, it is high time you abandoned them and gave yourself to the Lord. Otherwise, you will end up badly not only on this earth, but much more on the Day of Judgment!

 

There are people who wanted to have women, especially old men who love young girls aged between 15 and 18. I asked them for a bottle of perfume that they like and another item that I will not mention. All this was mixed and put in a bottle. I gave it to them accompanied of course by incantatory words. Once the perfumed client shook hands with a woman he desired, whether she was married or not, she was automatically possessed. In her dreams, in her thoughts, she could only see my client. Thus, she became his slave and was subjected to him in everything.

 

Sorcerers sow division in families, especially in polygamous families. This is often the case when there is a wife in the family who does not have children. This barren wife becomes a dangerous element; she is often the cause of failures, lack of success, chronic diseases that poison the social, material and financial life of her rivals' children (often the first wife). To do this, she goes to see sorcerers, marabouts to whom she communicates the names of all the children of the other woman, in order to bewitch them. Thus bewitched, working children do not really enjoy their salary in that they are unable to complete a project. For example, they cannot save money and build a house either in the village or in the city.

 

I have bewitched pupils and students in such a manner that when they are informed of a forthcoming assessment, they panic. They sometimes have headaches and fever. They have no other choice but to grab a cigarette to smoke, or to take pills or drugs, thus destroying their lives. Sorcerers are often at the root of this state of affairs. Others may not pass their exams even though they work well in all subjects. If you are a pupil or student, and you do not have Jesus in your life, you must put yourself under the protection of Jesus right now, otherwise sorcerers, always ready to destroy, may very well make you fail your exams.

 

[**5- Witchcraft and social promotion**]()

 

There are people who will never have a job until they have Jesus Christ in their lives. Whatever advanced studies they may have done and the university degrees they may have obtained, they will never know happiness. Their studies will be of no use. Their files will be filed in companies’ drawers, just because sorcerers have decided so. They have bewitched them. I myself have bewitched people to stay unemployed and fail until they die. The sorcerer who claims to ward off this evil spell is a liar. This evil can certainly be mitigated: the victim can find work, but after one or two months, he will be fired. That spell will always weigh on him. A healer can do nothing but extort money from him. He must accept Jesus Christ to be set free. It is Jesus who can heal this kind of bewitchment.

 

[**5.1- Help to bandits and traders**]()

 

I delivered fetishes to renowned bandits (anti-bullet, security belt). They were thus protected by demons. But these people end up pitifully because the fetishes I gave them have a limit. If you are very observant, you must have noticed a fan with nine lines, three at each corner of the triangle, hanging in some shops. These are products made from human blood, white clay and cowries. You will see that these shops are very busy because the fetishes attract customers. Other shops in the area are simply deprive of customers. But this success is not of long duration, because their wealth is based on sacrifices, on devilish ceremonies. These traders were soon in trouble and went bankrupt. This is a fact that I have personally observed. Therefore, I appeal to merchants who make sacrifices: if you do not accept Jesus Christ, know that you will have a tragic end.

 

[**5.2- Accidents and prosperity of transporters**]()

 

Some of the popular transporters in Côte d'Ivoire know me because of the help I had given them. Some of them started with two buses and ended up with 50 to 60 buses. How did it happen? There was one condition that had to be met: generally, the customer had to sacrifice one of his cars to the fetish sakpata. The sakpata fetish is a spirit that loves human blood. This demon is at the heart of disasters, wars and accidents. You often hear of car accidents with many deaths. Well, here's the reason. I simply asked the customer the matriculation of the bus to sacrifice, plus 500,000 FCFA that he had to bring to me after the accident. With the bus number, I would work with a fetish made up of human blood. This fetish is greedy for human blood. If it doesn't have human blood, it needs pig blood. It works when it rains. After the departure of the bus at a speed of 120 km/h, if there is a small rain, the tires slide and the bus rolls over. The ideal is that half the passengers die, because blood must flow.

 

Once this is done, the sacrifice is considered successful. After two to three months, this customer's business starts to thrive and he becomes rich. He can then buy several buses. Thus, innocent people die to ensure the prosperity of these criminals. To succeed in certain operations, I had signed pacts with sorcerers in Benin, where I went regularly. I could not always indicate the day when certain operations were to be carried out; it did not depend on me alone but also on the great sorcerers of Benin with whom I had signed pacts. Sometimes, when I saw that I could not do the work on the spot, I would fly to Benin. I'd go and see a great wizard who would do the thing for me and I'd fly back. I did this to satisfy my customers since my reputation depended on the success of my practice.

 

[**5.3- Help to musicians**]()

 

Most of the musicians you see and those that people envy are under the firm grip of demons. They have signed pacts with satan. I helped musicians and singers from various countries. I made a fetish based on a perfume they love and human blood for them. I asked them to bring these items, plus a sum of 200,000 francs. If they were unable to bring human blood, I would procure it myself for them for payment. This kind of job was expensive because of the work to be done. Indeed, I had to build the customer's reputation, make them known. I had to make sure that when their album came out, people would rush for it. Once that's done, people only had their names on their lips. This spirit works on journalists. If the musician has a concert, he only has to consult and make sacrifices. This concert cannot but succeed. This is what ensures the great success of certain stars whose cassettes are bought like hot cakes and who perform in packed theatres.

 

Thus, I helped foreign musicians come to liven up concerts. They had an extraordinary success, but the concerts ended up in bloody fights simply because this success was due to witchcraft. All this money won't do any good. They use it to drug themselves all day long. Some defend themselves by pretending they don't do drugs. In fact, it is witchcraft, it is fetish that drives them to do these things against their will. So these people don't end well. ***After having helped many musicians, I appeal to them today: give your life to Jesus Christ. Satan may raise you up, but you will end up badly.*** I ask these musicians from Cameroon and Zaire, who know themselves well, to accept Jesus Christ. Set your life in order with Jesus Christ.

 

[**5.4- Help to senior managers and appointments**]()

 

Do you see these personalities and top executives that run around bragging and run expensive Mercedes? Know that when they get in front of fetishists, especially when elections are coming up, they get very small. They become like kids in front of a simple witch doctor. This is a very funny scene. I say this as a witness, because I've also helped many senior executives. They came with a sheep plus 200,000 francs and I did the fetish. But these people don't end up well. When this power drops, they fall lower than they had been before then.

 

[**6- Race after wealth and power**]()

 

[**6.1- How I made people rich**]()

 

I began with prayers, then the consultation; the fetish specified the sacrifice to be imposed. There are many ways to become rich. Some were asked to bring a small amount of semen, a certain amount of human blood in a bottle and a sheep. I made sacrifices with these things. After the ceremony, I asked the client to bring me a suitcase in which I would dispose white sheets cut out in the format of 5000 and 10 000 FCFA notes. I poured the sperm, human blood and sheep's blood on the papers with incantatory words and handed him the suitcase. After seven days, when he opens the suitcase, he will find large quantities of authentic bank notes, which he can use as he pleases. But in return for the sperm delivered as collateral, he will have no children. He may have sex, but he can never have children. That is why we see many rich people without children. They possess all sorts of things, but they have no children. After they die, their families can't use that money. It needs to be squandered. I have helped people get rich in this way, but I have to say that all ***those whose wealth is based on witchcraft end up badly***: they have big cars, Mercedes, big houses and a lot of money, but they end up pitiful.

 

[**6.2- Magic bank notes**]()

 

I had a fetish made up of 1 000 FCFA, 5 000 FCFA and 10 000 FCFA notes but also 500 FCFA notes. I used to say incantatory words on these notes before I handed them to customers. They made purchases with these money from merchants. Once one of these notes is found in the sales of the day, the merchant will always lose money. After a few years, they go bankrupt and it's a mess. Many of these merchants can't make it again. Sorcerers are often at the origin of the bankruptcy of traders. In the beginning, these traders prosper, but after a few years, it’s a mess.

 

[**6.3- Debauchery and albino sacrifice**]()

 

After consultation, it happens that the evil spirit asks them to sleep with a mad woman under a shed or with their eldest daughter - nowadays, there are clients who consent. What would men not do to get rich? After sleeping with a crazy woman on the street at night, they become extremely rich. They own trailers, buses. But they end up being crazy and their descendants have problems using this wealth that is destined to disappear. Others were asked to offer an albino child for sacrifice. It was the favourite formula of most clients and the reason was: just bringing the hair of an albino. The work was done in their room, and the albino died wherever they were. The client also had to abstain from sexual intercourse with a woman some time before the sacrifice.

 

When satan grants power, it is irresistible at first, but then it ends badly. The lives of his servants are in danger and he himself takes it upon himself to destroy them. As far as I was concerned, I could help people to become rich after consulting the fetishes because it was the fetishes who prescribed what to bring. I made sacrifices so people would become millionaires, even billionaires. But once these people die, their wealth dissipates. ***For, the riches which satan brings do not last****.* As a sorcerer, I helped a lot of people get rich that way. In this field, my reputation had gone beyond the borders of Côte d'Ivoire to the point where I had clients who came from Gabon, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Senegal, Mali, etc. As you know, one client sometimes brings several.

 

[**6.4- Human sacrifices**]()

 

Many rich people and billionaires make human sacrifices every year to sustain their wealth. And this human sacrifice is made either on October 31, November 30 or December 31 to end the year. If you have noticed, it is from the month of October that children are abducted, and this until December. These kids, we do not find them anymore. Even adults are kidnapped. They sucked blood from their bodies to get rich. One thing's for sure, all these kidnappers end badly afterwards. They pay the price of their heinous crime. The very rich are generally untouchable because of their relationships in the upper spheres of the State where they are protected.

1gmclpl,https://i.redd.it/2u09nq75kmzd1.jpeg,Grandma’s TV,"I grew up in a pretty typical family in suburbia: middle class family, a goofy dog, and an older sister with such grace and natural beauty - though I never would have had the maturity to admit that back then, my sister is a wonderful woman - with a penchant for tormenting her younger, awkward brother. Picturesque and nondescript. 

Being an edgy teenager, I pretended to loathe it. It was cool to look so spiteful, I guess, and clearly absolutely nobody could possibly understood me. High school came and went, junior college flew by too, and currently, I am enduring med school. Some things never changed though, at least in a fashion sense. I still wear band shirts from time to time, but I no longer paint the dark circles under my eyes with cheap eye liner, the stress and lack of sleep from school does that on its own. 

Though I had long since moved away, I was blessed to still be close to home, which allowed for occasional comfort and delicious meals. But those perks became fewer and farther between as I grew busier with school and life in general.

Empty nest syndrome hit the folks hard. Mom decided to return to work full time at the law firm to satiate idle hands, she landed two promotions in a few years. And dad retired to chase dreams and new hobbies. His pride and joy, a podcast of sorts geared at amateur radios and music, grew to some notoriety. Credit to dad: despite all his nerdiness, he pulled it off and it was reasonably entertaining. The two stayed busy but rarely took the time to indulge in true relaxation with each other. But the day finally came when they decided that such was long overdue.

Dad proudly waved the tickets for a 9 day cruise and resort in some tropical place before pleading with me to look after the house, the cat, and my dad’s baby: the show. They’d be gone a total of 12 days. There was some long lecture about how it needed diligent care to upkeep, and “please make sure the scheduled things uploaded.” He joked with some sincerity that I could play a few songs from my high school band’s days of glory, but realistically I knew he had long prepared his audience for his temporary hiatus.

My parents’ flight left in the afternoon, and I arrived in the morning just in time to watch Mom panic-pack and unpack at least three times to ensure nothing was forgotten. Dad shoved the keys to the house in my hands with one last reminder about “diligence,” and I politely nodded and wished them well and not to get too badly sunburned. As they waved their goodbyes, the clock struck 1:00 PM.

It dawned on me that I hadn’t been home in almost seven months, despite living only 20 minutes away. Now, the house almost seemed foreboding. The noisy and charming memories of childhood seemed stifled in the quiet cookie-cutter exterior of this freshly empty house. The dark wooden floors offered a hollow chord to my footsteps, and I damn near pissed myself when Spanky, a crotchety feline, jumped off the stairwell and darted down the basement stairs situated in the hallway. I cursed him under my breath as I recalled the cat was strictly forbidden from the basement because he had recently started pissing on things down there. 

During my previous visits, I had never bothered to see how my father remodeled the basement into his studio and household storage unit. It had always creeped me out as a child, and I guess that fear lingered, even in adulthood, because I just never went in there. I’d have to confront that fear for the next 12 days.

“Spankyyy” I peered my head into the dim stairwell and called to the cat, “come here Spanks. Good kitty, come here, you filthy fleabag.”

Entering the basement, dad had painted the floor with gray acrylic, and though it was painfully chilled for bare feet, it was easy to clean and kept everything tidy. Opposite the stairs, dad installed a small office to cut noise where his computers resided and the podcast played. It sat in a corner as a small, insulated box with one thick window to allow sight into the world beyond the cube. The rest of the basement was full of neatly arranged metal shelving full of unused household objects, seasonal decor, and Grandma’s belongings. Grandma had recently passed and my parents stored her stuff in the basement for later sorting that would likely never happen. 

She had an old tube television that she would hover over in her latter days, fixated to the point where she’d fail to acknowledge any living creature around her. No matter how it was adjusted, the TV never worked. Only salt and pepper danced across the screen. We realized her lucidity was in dire states when she became so obsessed with the television that she nearly starved her cat and herself (I should mention that the cat outlived her and is the same asshole prowling the basement at this moment). For whatever reason, the TV found a place on my father’s new shelves instead of the local dump. I reached to turn the knobs on the television but redirected my attention at the sound of something upstairs.

“Mike?” A voice called from above.

I had grown so absorbed in the cat that I had forgotten I invited Lyle over to study for an upcoming exam. I called him downstairs and we exchanged greetings. He was proud to display a thermos of warm whiskey-laced coffee and a six pack of beer, for studying, of course.

Lyle helped me extricate the cat - rather, it extricated itself as it bolted up the stairs with a ferocious hiss and we shut the door behind the beast. We opted to study in the office, enjoying the seclusion and lack of external distraction.

I’d had enough of the Krebs cycle and sighed deeply. Our brains had reached beyond the capacity to handle much more and we agreed it was time to call it a night. The clock flashed 9 PM and confirmed that thought. Lyle stood and stretched, exploring the shelving. His eyes locked on Grandma’s TV and he reached to touch the screen.

“Careful, Lyle, that thing might suck you in,” I joked. 

Lyle passed a confused look my way.

“Ah, it’s nothing. As a kid, my sister and I used to joke that that thing was possessed, and Grandma used to mutter that she saw otherworldly things through it.” I made spooky hands and sounds.

“Ha,” he muttered half heartily. “Listen, Mike... I better go.”

I glanced at him quizzically, “alright. Drive safe.” I presumed his sudden aversion was the consequence of a tired brain. As Lyle’s presence fully vanished, I opted to check on the show and throw up my own tidbit on a brief live episode. Dad had pumped up his followers that I would.

“Hello crew,” I spoke into the microphone, attempting to act like I had done this before. “This is... Mad Mike.” I paused, and the roll of my eyes was nearly audible as I reread the instructions to address myself as Mad Mike. “While James is off adventuring, he’s left me in charge of the place.” My voice cracked as I skimmed over the things Dad listed that I could talk about.

“Here’s a little spook for you to mull around your skulls in this evening hour. I grew up in this house, but we recently acquired my Grandma’s things in her passing, including the infamous haunted television from my childhood. What makes it haunted, I’m sure you ask? If you turn it on and look at it directly, the best you’ll get is a salt and pepper screen. However, if you see it in your peripheral, it shows flashes of harrowing images. Look back, and you’ll never fully see the images because they’ll be gone as strangely as they appeared in the corner of your eye. Or, at least that’s what we said as kids. So I gotta live with that thing for the next twelve days, and I’m going to try to discern those “ghost” images during my stay. Peace out, this is... Mad Mike.”

Walking up to the shelves, I saw the cold screen of the TV and contemplated what I was about to do. Carefully lifting it from its slumber, I brought it into the office and plugged it in. I held my fingers still on the knob, weighing the growing fear in my stomach one last time before I inevitably released some calamity of monsters free to this world.

Click. I laughed with relief as not even the familiar salt and pepper danced across the screen. It was broken.


DAY ONE

In conjunction with the show, Dad and his friends had created a forum for his audience to talk. I think that was part of the success of the show, how interactive it was and how deeply it connected people from all over. I perused the forum subjects with particular interest on Current, and laughed to see “Mad Mike” mentioned several times. “Don’t get eaten by the sitcom demons” brought me a smile.

I typed out the comment, “Good morning folks, this is Mad Mike. I regret to inform you, though I’m secretly relieved, that the TV is broken. There will be no sitcom demons during my time here.” And with that, I pressed send, gathered my things, and set off for work and class.

I returned late in the evening. It was nice to be in such a homey place instead of my poor man’s overpriced studio. Spanky perched halfway up the stairs at her usual overlook, her tail twitching mildly in displeasure at my intrusion. I was surprised to learn that I was excited to check the show. I knew I had little part in it, but it brought my dad so much joy and I was happy to share that. 

My excitement was cut short, however. The sturdy basement door was ajar and I was certain, without doubt, I had shut it. I looked skeptically at Spanky, and as much as I would have liked to blame her, I knew that spastic cat was not capable of such a feat.

Nothing was amiss downstairs. I made my updates and checked the scheduled upload. I looked at the TV, quietly perched where I had left it in the office, still plugged in. Quickly, I turned it on but nothing had changed: it was still broken. I rolled my eyes, slightly disappointed with myself that I had honestly thought it could be any different. 

On. Off. On. Off. The repetition of the act enforced my empowered state of mind. And no matter how badly a sliver of me wanted something to happen just one time, the only thing that appeared was my reflection staring disapprovingly with the office doorway behind me. 

On. Off- a silhouette of a shadowed, gangly figure loomed in the doorway behind my own reflection. I shot like a rocket forward and around. But no one stood in the open doorway.

Off. And unplugged.


DAY TWO:


With the approach of morning, I gladly awoke from a troubled sleep. There was no way to explain what I had seen on the TV, but I chocked it up to nervous anticipation playing tricks on the mind.

To my delight, class had been canceled and I wasn’t scheduled for work today. Realistically, that meant a day to dedicate to studying. Given the event that took place the night before, I opted to study in the open air of the living room rather than the basement, but that proved challenging, as Spanky is legitimately a psychotic bitch. The cat made every effort to harass and break my morale, even bringing a live mouse as the final straw which she proudly dropped on my book, causing the creature to scurry across my workspace and me to throw my papers. I cursed the beast, gathered my things, and slammed the basement door behind me.

Entering the basement was a sober change of pace. Though I still lingered in my frustration, an unsettling sense of dread filled me as I surveyed the space. The TV sat dumbly where it had been left all night, so I reluctantly began my studies.
	
Transfixed on my studies, the TV suddenly turned on with a horrible buzz, black and white specks dancing over the screen. My heart slammed in my chest. I turned the knob to shut off the television, and stared in disbelief. Quickly, I checked the door beside me, relaxing only slightly when I found no intruder.

Still shaking and stupefied, I needed some form of human encouragement. 


“Hey guys,” I announced. “It’s Mike - Mad Mike.” I had quickly lost my suave. Dad would be disappointed, I needed to pull it together. “We uh, we’ve got a scheduled show just around the corner… But before that I thought it’d be fun to feed your imagination. Remember that old TV I told you about? Well, the dam - goshdarned thing just turned on by itself. Spooky stuff, folks,” I teased. “Spooky stuff,” the humor in my voice faded. “But like I said, we got a fine lineup- FUCK!”

The TV turned back on. I cringed realizing the the colossal fuck I had just dropped on Dad’s baby.

“Well ha!” I laughed nervously. “It uh... it’s back on! HA! Isn’t that the darnedest thing.” 

The fear was thick on my voice. “Uh... enjoy the show,” I exited the stream. 

To compliment the black and white blizzard across the screen, the horrible sound of static blared through its tiny speakers. Worse still, despite frantic efforts to shut it off, the television wouldn’t stop, even when unplugged.

I tried to ignore it, but my best efforts were futile. The static picked at every nerve, making study impossible and clouding my reason. When I left, I swear I could hear it other parts of the house. Hoping for some solution, I checked the forum:

“It must have a battery.”

“BRUUUH”

“Get that thing out of the house!” 

“Pussy!!!”

They offered no real resolution, but the TV was powered off now, and I guess it does make sense that there must be a battery somewhere in the device. At least I’ll tell myself that.


DAY THREE:

During the night, sleep came uneasily and stayed even less easily. Noises plagued the house and sounded eerily like footsteps, I woke cranky, exhausted, and with little time to waste before class. I rushed down the stairs towards the front door when I noticed that the basement door was, once again, wide open. 

Spanky must have known I didn’t have time to spare this morning and made a brilliant dash into the basement despite my efforts to grab her. With time ticking away, I ran down the basement stairs, cursing and praying for a quick removal. Spanky hid under the nearest shelf.

“Dammit, Spanky, I don’t have time for this. Get out of here.” I sneered. I heard her meow in mournful response.

“Come here. Come here, kitty.”

“Mrrrrrrow,” she wailed. 

“Spanky, please!”

She hissed savagely and scampered into the office.

“Spanky, if you get eaten, I will feel zero remorse. ... Spanky?”

“Mrow.” Followed by a deep, feline growl. I entered the room to find Spanky in the corner furthest from the television. Her tail flailed wildly and every hair on her body stood on end as she yowled at the TV.

I cooed at her in a desperate attempt to calm her. The TV was off. There was no haunting image, just a slightly skewed view of the room with me crouching towards an angry, senile cat. As I diverted my attention, the reflection on the TV moved in the corner of my eye, but looking back at it, it was the same image as before. I looked at the TV. What the hell was going on. 

Spanky took the chance to run out of the room and back upstairs. I was relieved that she chose to make this ordeal somewhat easier, and, my eyes still locked on the TV, I quickly grabbed it to place it back on the shelves.

“Hi, twerp,” it was the familiar voice of my sister, but still scared me half to death. “That was a better scare than I was expecting!”

“Funny,” I glared at her.

“Hey, ma and pa said you’d be here, and I just wuv you so much,”

“I don’t have time for this,” I said with half feigned frustration and full sincerity. “But… do you remember the stories we used to tell about this thing?” I gestured with my face at the TV.

“Oh gosh, those old ghost stories? I don’t know. Something about teeth on the screen and voices? You know grandma was a few screws loose in those days.” At that moment she noticed the look of concern on my face. “Hey, you alright?”
 “Yeah. Yeah, It’s nothing. I have a stressful exam soon and now I’m going to be late for class today.”
Sister smiled sternly and hugged me ferociously before practically shoving me up the stairs, promising to lock up the house and deal with the cat. I thanked her and ran out the door.


DAY SIX:

The last two days went smoothly, and I was content to believe that the few weird episodes I had experienced were nothing to worry about. I was just stressed. All my woes must have been caused by an anxious mind. Not ghosts. Not a demonic TV. Just stress and exasperated by a vindictive cat. I vigorously scratched Spanky’s neck as she expressed a rare moment of affection. I’d certainly blame her for all of this, after her antics. 

Since seeing my sister, I hadn’t bothered to check dad’s podcast. Dad did set it up to run on it’s own, after all. But I thought perhaps I wasn’t being as diligent as I could be. So I made a point to hold my promise and check all his accounts when I got home later that evening.

Opening the forums revealed a medley of notifications and a handful of private messages. Most speculated that I was now dead, but one caught my attention and sent shivers down my spine:

“Have you seen it?”

I scowled at the message, contemplating my next move. Three familiar buttons danced suddenly danced across the screen as the sender prepared a new message:

“When you do, it’s too late. Get rid of it.”

Not if, but when. I didn’t bother to reply.

The message left such a sour taste in my mouth that I decided I’d rather play a movie upstairs and read my notes. Approaching the stairs, something caught my eye. I groaned as I scanned the room and realized it came from the direction of the television.

Its obsolete hulk sat quietly on the shelf. I thought perhaps the movement could be answered by Spanky because it was roughly the same color, but searching the area around the TV revealed no angry cat. I turned my eyes to the left side of the isle when I saw it again by the television. Woefully, as my eyes darted back to the TV, there was nothing to be seen, just a still, black screen. My pulse erupted. It was real. It wasn’t the nerves of college life. 

When we were kids, we never spent much time with grandma alone, and as she grew more insane she never left that television. We’d have dinner “with” her, but she’d just snap at us and take one or two bites of food off her TV tray table and stare and that damned box. She grew violent, flipping the tray and demanding answers from the television. 

The final straw, however, came after she chased me down and held my face against the glass screen while she screeched at me to tell her what I could see. I cried. I pissed myself. Dad pried her off of me, and Mom finally agreed with her sisters that it was time Grandma needed professional care. That was the end of our stories about the TV she coveted so greatly. 

We never saw anything, maybe that was because our minds just couldn’t quite grasp it or maybe it was because the TV was fully preoccupied with her. Nonetheless, I was now seeing what we had whispered as children. My eyes grew wide and my pupils dilated with adrenaline. 
	

“I could look away,” I thought. “I just have to keep my eyes locked on the other side of the isle, and then I’ll have an answer to this thing. It’ll be nothing. I won’t see anything. And I can kick myself, sure.”

It took every ounce of will to move my eyes to the other side, but in immediate response the TV flashed in the corner of my eye. My gut reaction made me look back at the screen, trying to see clearly what writhed in my peripheral. It offered only a mute reflection.

“Don’t look back dammit, fuck, why am I even doing this???” I asked myself out loud.

“Don’t. Look. Back. Keep focus.” I whispered to myself before my eyes darted to the other side. I was so focused that I couldn’t see the box of Christmas lights in front of my eyes as the images in my peripheral flashed like a morbid strobe. 

I couldn’t discern the images in any clarity. Light flickered unsteadily like a candle and something fleshy rotated perpetually. But the most disturbing was what appeared to be a set of horrid teeth: a horribly deformed maw with slobbery, bucked teeth. It gagged and its tongue wiggled out of its toothy gate like a bloated seal on a rocky shore. The entire image played in an uncomfortable orange hue, and those teeth... I could almost hear the thick-saliva-coated lips smacking together. My gaze slowly drifted back- the television burst on with a ferocious hiss of salt and pepper.

“You’re not even plugged in!?!?” I shoved it off the shelf and it fell dumbly to the floor, birthing a single, deep crack from top to bottom. The chaos on the screen stopped. I fled upstairs and slammed the basement door.

I grabbed liquor from the cabinet, and poured a generous glass, gulping it greedily.

“This can’t- there has be some kind of logical explanation.”

I rummaged through my coat’s pockets for the pack of cigs I was holding for a friend. I could count the number of times I had smoked, and very few of those times actually warranted the necessity, but this time it did. I grabbed the cig and ran outside, deeply and selfishly inhaling the warm, acrid smoke. I focused on breath and the sting in my lungs. 

The last time I enacted this ritual was during a meltdown early in my college life. I laughed at how trivial that event was in comparison to this... supernatural bullshit. Hell, this thing probably caused my grandma’s demise! It indirectly - maybe even directly - killed a person, drove her mad! Wait… was I mad? Was this a mental breakdown? Schizophrenia? No, no. Stop.

I threw the butt on the ground and drove my shoe into it. I exhaled, deeply, shoulders slouching and lungs wheezing, before opening the door.

The basement door was wide open and the television rested in front of it, pointed towards the front door. I shut the front door and opened it again, hoping the scene in the house would be different. But it wasn’t. I walked carefully towards it, refusing to take my eyes off of it lest the images return in sinister precision. I plucked the TV off the floor, holding it far from my person as if it were some filthy object, ran outside, and threw it in the trash for the garbage man.

Another shot of the went down with a sting in my throat. 


DAY SEVEN:

I sat against my bed on the floor all night. I kept the lights on, and every time I dared to doze I’d wake startled and terrified.

Throughout the night the noises in the house increased, except this time they were certainly the sounds of bare feet pacing the house. They prowled in an unsure gait. I heard a few things fall. Many times, Spanky even acknowledged the noises, and hissed one time when I thought the footsteps approached my bedroom door.

Her hiss reverberated into a deep growl and her hackles prickled erect when the footsteps returned to the door a second time. The final plap separated by the thin panels of the hollow core door. Quietly, I crept to the door to brace it, and, o my displeasure, I realized I could hear an indiscernible whisper on the other side as I grew closer. 

The speaker was so hushed it was impossible to make out what they were saying, but there was a cadence to the sound and a venom in its pitch. I placed my ear silently against the door to better hear it: the whispering stopped abruptly, replaced a moment later by the wet separation of gums and mouth. Chewing. Slapping. I could almost feel its hot breaths behind its messy jaw movements. Suddenly, the piercing sound of static caused me to reel awake.

The light of dawn was just starting to fill the sky. I was still on the floor, and Spanky blinked slowly towards me with her paws tucked under her chest when I flinched awake.

“Spanks, you had my back all night.” I warily smiled at her. “I won’t blame you after this week, I promise.”

I groggily lifted myself from the floor. Looking at the clock, I was already late for class. 

“All or nothing,” I sighed, embracing the opportunity to ditch and evaluate my potentially failing mental health. I only cared about coffee, maybe some Bailey’s in that coffee too.

Placing my hand on the doorknob, I paused. I had to leave the room at some point, and I begrudgingly pulled the door towards me, revealing the cracked, wretched TV patiently waiting for me on the other side.

“I guess it’s better to be late than not show up at all,” I thought.

I did everything I could to avoid home. Even though I attended class, I couldn’t take notes let alone actually learn anything. Throughout the entire lecture I kept seeing... things. But as soon as I looked over where it was, it’d be gone. At one point during class I watched a classmate silently ignite and burn alive. I refused to acknowledge it, sweating and trembling in my seat, but suddenly I could smell the burning flesh. I ran out of class to puke in the nearest trash can.

I went out for dinner with friends, but when they started to notice I was acting aloof, I left; there was no sense explaining what was going on as it’d be over in just a few days. I went to the bar and drank alone until closing. It was a dive bar, and while dive bars attract interesting people, everyone looked horrifically disfigured in my peripheral. In every corner lurked a tall shadow of a lanky, gray man until, once again, I looked that way only to see a well lit, empty space. 

The man next to me at the bar top clacked his disfigured jaws together, teeth protruding in all directions, and I looked at him in disgust only to see that his face was perfectly normal. I nervously gestured to my drink in an attempt to cover for myself, but he held his glare at me and told me to “get fucked.” I chugged the remaining half of my beer and left for home.

I parked my car in the driveway but I refused to go inside. I sat in my car for another hour before finally working up the courage to go inside and bee-line for my room, drunkenly stumbling up the stairs.

Exhaustion won.


DAY NINE:

3 AM. Every electronic device in the house turned suddenly on, screeching, buzzing, beeping all at once. I woke with a start, immediately on my feet. I tripped over the television, now resting foot of my bed. The black and white blizzard whirled over the screen, and I lifted it over and my head and chucked it down the stairs. 

Even after flying through the air, it still displayed the static screen and horrible buzz. I spent the next 37 minutes turning off everything in the house. Unlike the demon television, the other devices shut off. But the TV, freshly shattered, continued to play.

I ran downstairs towards the office but… stopped at the shelves. One shelf was newly emptied, and a chunk of meat rested on the shelves, slowly crawling in tight circles and groping like a wayward leech.

I bolted past the disembodied flesh into the office, logging in and searching for the ominous message I had ignored earlier.

“What do I do if I see it?” I typed frantically.

An hour passed without response. “I told you to get rid of it when you had the chance.”

“Gee, thanks. That’s so helpful.”

“...”

“No, no. Look, there’s so much going on right now. Forgive me, I don’t mean to be an
ass. But I need a serious answer on what to do.

“Well, have you seen it?’

“What’s it?”

“The man. Have you seen the gray man?”

“In the corner of my eye.”

“Then there’s a chance. Burn it.” 


A loud crash from the bathroom upstairs absorbed my attention. It was too loud to ignore and I didn’t want to be caught off guard and cornered in the basement. I approached the bathroom. I knocked on the door, hoping by some stupid chance a friend would reply.

I was no surgeon yet, but I opened the door with similar precision. Each click of its interior gears caused my heart to stall, each second dragging a perceived eternity. Before it was fully open, I groped for the light switch, illuminating the sacrilegious tomb in incandescent gloom. The light gave me the confidence to open the door fully, and I squinted in the yellow glow as if it were as bright as the Sun. 

I looked at my face. Something was wrong. I opened my mouth wide and all my teeth were yellowed, decayed and protruding. As I stared at my reflection, mouth agape, I could not control the rapid repetition of my jaw clacking open and shut, open and shut, open and shut, sending sticky tendrils of spit across the mirror. I slammed the light switch off and fell out of the bathroom.

I grabbed the TV. It had not moved from where I threw it earlier. From the kitchen, I grabbed the strongest proof bottle from the liquor cabinet and a cast iron pan... the best hammer I could improvise in a rush. I threw the television in the driveway and pulverized it with the pan. Plastic shrapnel scattered. I poured the potent liquor over the mess and threw a match on it. Slowly, the flames gained traction. I was relieved to watch it burn. Thick plumes of black smoke began to trail from its remains, and I caught a neighbor gawking. Glaring at the nosy neighbor, they immediately averted their gaze, shutting their blinds. I didn’t care.

I abruptly recalled that dad hid a handgun in a minimalist case velcroed under the couch. I wanted the assurance of brass and gunpowder, even if it was futile or unnecessary at this point. No time to waste, I flipped the couch and retrieved the 9 mm. Spanky perched nearby, uncomfortable at the disturbance. I grabbed her and pled for her cooperation. 

I ran downstairs with Spanky and the gun. I ensured that the basement door was shut and quickly passed through the storage area. There was no phantom slug meat, no possessed TV. Was it over?

I dragged Spanky into the office and shut the door behind me. I took the extra chair in the office and propped it against the door’s handle. I held my head in my hands for a long while before resuming. To my disbelief, the day had been spent, and the clock in the corner of the monitor displayed 11:47 PM.

“I destroyed it. I smashed it and I burned it.” I sent the stranger.

“Good.” He replied. “Anything since then?” 

“No.”

11:59 PM: I fell asleep with my face in my hands, elbow dragging out the letter N into the reply box.


DAY TEN:

I woke at 4:59 with a nauseous feeling in my gut. Resisting the urge to spew whatever meager stomach contents I had in my father’s office, I ran upstairs into the hallway bathroom, emptying the contents into the toilet. The foul taste of bile filled my mouth, and I drooled into the toilet, watching the strands of green-tinted spit slowly fall into the bowl.

I stood up and shifted to the right. I pitied my reflection. My eyes were sunken. My skin was pale. I was clearly exhausted. I opened the mirror’s medicine cabinet and rifled through the list of medication. I was searching desperately for ibuprofen and some sort of sleep aid, maybe a prescription muscle relaxant to boot. I was fortunate to find all three.
I slammed the mirror shut. The reflection revealed the doorway behind me with a gangly figure in the middle stepping forward. I threw the pills. Their delicate pings echoed in my ear as they collided and rolled down the porcelain, bouncing everywhere like a hypochondriac’s confetti. Whirling around, there was no one in the doorway, but I dared not risk it. I fled down the basement stairs, tripping near the middle.

While the fall was far from graceful, it could have been worse. I lay sprawled on the floor in a stupor. Groaning in agony, I sat upright slowly. I crawled into the office, slamming the door behind me and propping the chair against the door. Spanky hissed cruelly. The damn TV was on the table.

I video called the stranger over and over until he answered, “it didn’t work! It didn’t work!”

“What’s happening?”

“It’s here. I saw it. In the reflection. The TV is in here too. I don’t get it. I burned it! I
BURNED IT!!!”

“A reflection? It’s still a reflection. You haven’t seen it in pers-“

Spanky yowled. I looked in her direction. Her hair stood on end and her teeth were bared in ferocious display. My heart raced, but I followed her eyes’ path to the window.

Something loomed on the other side: a horrible figure leaned against the window. It propped its anorexic, pale body on the glass as, perhaps hoping it would break with little effort. Mouth agape, each breath left fog on the glass before it. The half-decayed jaw muscles propelled its mouth to close like a trap over and over again. Suddenly, it’s ghostly eyes rolled towards me, and through its white pupils I could tell that it was looking at me, watching me. It screeched. It pounded its fists on the glass and the static blared. 


Hours passed, the TV still twitching in static and illuminating enough of the room to let me know that there was movement on the other side of the glass. But that damn static sound. I wanted to cry… I did. I wept until my collar and sleeves were soggy. But that demon gave no remorse. It lingered in the dim light on the other side of the glass, approaching occasionally to watch me like a zoo display.

I stood up and stared down my foe. It stood at least a foot taller than me and predicted my every movement, mimicking me with startling accuracy. I held the gun to my head and it held its hand, fingers rolled in a mock revolver to its head and what remnants of its lips curled in a smirk. I mocked the sound of a gunshot and pulled the gun back in “ricochet.” It copied.

I held the gun to the window, challenging it. It glowered back now, furious at my defiance.

“I’ll shoot you,” I stammered, “square between the eyes!” 

Only that clear barrier of glass separated the monster’s forehead and the muzzle of my gun. It smashed its fists against the glass, shrieking once again as the window shook. I let loose the single round, and another. The glass did not crack and my ears rang. Violently, the window imploded, showering me in glass. Where the window formerly perched, a static TV screen had replaced it.

I could not... handle the sound... any longer.

“What do you see???” I replayed the memory of my grandmother screaming at me, spit flying from her mouth as she hissed through clenched teeth.


DAY ELEVEN:

“Yo, twerp!” Sister had used a spare key to open the front door. “I know you’re here somewhere... I see your car!” She cocked her head at the sight of pills strewn upon the floor by the half bath.

“Hey, dad called. He said there was something wrong with the podcast?” He said he was worried you had mucked it up? Where are you??? Dude, he said some weirdo was harassing him about you... twerp?” She was startled by Spanky who bolted from the jarred basement door, sliding on the floor in a panic.

Spanky ran past her feet under the kitchen table, leaving a trail of sticky, dark foot prints on the wooden floor. She ran her fingers across them to reveal a crimson stain across her fingers. The cat perched under the table, licking its paws. Hesitating but a moment, she grabbed the basement door and ran downstairs. It was dark, aside from the flickering light of a television. She flicked the light on.
	
“Michael?!? No...”

The open window offered no screen to the grisly mess of her brother. His head lulled backwards, throat slit and exposed by a brutal shard of glass still clutched in his hand. Sobbing, she pried at the barricaded door. As her efforts failed, she trembled as she dialed 911, pausing only but a moment when movement caught the corner of her eye.

1gmclca,https://i.redd.it/4ynwzjd0kmzd1.jpeg,Review of my Collection (AMA),"I've (19M) been collecting for over a year now. I'll give reviews for some of my top 5

1) Sharaf blend - Eventhough this is a clone, this is my favorite since it reminds me of my childhood in Saudi, when my family used to go to the carnivals on the weekends. Smells like dates, vanilla and musky. I've tried khamrah as well, they're similar but Sharaf blend isn't as strong, lasts around the same duration though. Got this from perfume palace. (10/10)

2) Tobacco Vanille - This has got to be my favorite designer perfume. This smells very luxurious, the tobacco is blended well with the vanilla, cacao and spices. Gives off Christmas vibes. This thing is beastmode and lasts 8+ hours. Got this from Pranay(Scentoria). (10/10)

3) Stronger with you intensely - I really like this one. It's warm, spicy, and sweet. I've tried Althair and I do prefer it over SWY, this has the same vibe to it so I got this instead. Lasts a decent while 6+ but doesn't project as much I had heard. Got this from Dubai Duty free. (9/10)

4) Amore caffe - This was my first niche. The notes really appealed to me, ice cream, vanilla, sugar. This smells like a caramel macchiato. Could've been higher but I'm not the biggest fan of coffee. This thing is beastmode mode and probably lasts the longest in my collection. Got this from belvish. (9/10)

5) Eau d'hadrien - I got this because it's apparently Tom Cruise's favorite perfume and he's one of my favorite actors. This smells like zingy lemon, very fresh. This is something I would wear during the summers of Italy, smells old school. Lasts 4+ hours on my skin and projects moderately. Got this from Praney(Scentoria). (8.5/10)

Rest in my collection are Dior Homme Intense, Valentino Uomo Born in Roma EDT, Tom ford Noir extreme Parfum, Lattafa Asad, Albait Aldimashqi Ombre nomade",3,1731048526.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,4,1.0,False

1gmcadj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gmcadj,Cargo the max and beyond,"Kia Ora and much aroha to the global cargo bike massive from Chch NZ.

I'm riding a Radkutsche Rapid front box bike. It got a ezee front motor and 1x10 gearing. Has 180mm rotors on single piston Tektro brakes. I use Schwalbe Pick Up tyres and have been through two sets. I've replaced the full drive train just recently. Replaced brake pads three times and done two bleeds. 

I have had the bike almost five years and put about 8000kms on the bike. When my kids were small I used to carry two of them and regularly do 70km round trips for sports. Biggest day out we did 110km of running around and errands.

Kids have outgrown the bike but it's still a daily rider for shopping, picnics and getting about with my GF and just general steez.

I worked for a community bike shop for several years so the bike served as a bike Ute. I figured out how to carrry up to 8x bikes. Tried running a trailer for a while, but it was just getting silly at that point.

Sometimes in the summer I load up the bike with a sound system and do bike raves or just beer rides around the park with a sound system.

I did manage to snap the frame in half, probably from dropping curbs with the full sound system on board. The weight load for the bike is 200kgs including the rider (and the bike weight apparently). So I was often far exceeding the weight limit!

My mate who builds catgo bikes (Cargo Bike World, Chch) repaired the frame by cutting it in half and sleeving it back together. It's been back on the road six months, so far so good, but I'm a bit more careful now, although I still carry other adults around.

I ride this bike everywhere including the hills, single track, gravel, etc. Had it up to the axels in mud. Bombed hills with passengers maxing out at 80kmph. It's more stable with weight but handles like a dream. 

During cyclocross season the bike serves as a team whip (Bad Bike Team). I ferry my fixed gear cross bike, coffee gear, lunch and bike tools to the race meets with my crew. 

The bike has helped replace 80% of my car use. So is an permanent part of my collection now. I ride fixed gear otherwise.

I bought the bike to live without a car and it has done that job exceptionally.

My mate carpenter built me a new wodden front box with a wider width than factory so that I could fit the kids side by side. I might just go to a minimalist flat tray in the future to reduce weight and drag.

Tbh I have some design issues with the frame. It's heavy than it needs to be for the strength It is. I was disappointed the frame snapped but not shocked cause I absolutely hammer the bike with no mercy. 

The electrics are good but when my battery fully dies I probably won't replace it and just ride it natty. I live in a flat city.

Where I live has a developing cycle lane infrastructure, but the electric zip the bike to 30km pretty fast and I'm a confident rider so don't mind holding my own in traffic. The bike is big so you can own the road a little. But it's also surprisingly fast and nimble despite it's size.

Have ridden a few other cargo bikes, but I love front box design for the carry capacity and it's really great with a passenger. Having chats while you ride.

The kids won't ride with me anymore, but they are starting to take the bike out with friends. So kind of mission accomplished.

Imo cargo bikes are the freaking best. Except for fixed gear bikes, which are a little bit cooler.

Has anyone divorced while still having love for their spouse? Is this the right decision for me?

Spoiler Alert: there are no villains in this story.

We've been married 15 years. We have two young children elementary and middle school age.

I have no idea how to summarize 15 years into a few paragraphs, but here goes.

Highschool sweethearts. Broke up because college. Both found serious relationships. Both relationships ended. We found each other again completely by chance. Like almost literally bumped into each other in a public place. We got married a couple years later. Serendipity, am I right?

As life happened, with the bills and mortgage and kids, it got a little rocky at times. But mutual love and respect got us through. I will admit that I was probably not the best partner. Stress with the kids and my work was eating me alive. I wasn't very fun to be around at times, but she was patient with me and I'll always remember that. And with time came emotional maturity and I was able to get out of that rut. I became a better father and husband. I'm a much better man today than I was in my 20s.

Before I get to the problems, I do want to make it clear that I put my family before everything. I am there for them everyday. I don't have hobbies or other interests that keep me away from them. I don't drink or go out with the boys all the time. I don't spend any money on myself because I'd rather my wife and kids have everything they need. I cook for them. I clean. Do laundry. Take care of all the outside work. I dote on my wife. She loves coffee in bed so I make sure she gets a fresh cup every morning before I go to work. I do other kind things for her that she doesn't even ask me to do because I love taking care of her. When I have a day off through the week, I get the kids ready and take them to school and I pick them up later. Help them with their homework. Just so she can get a break. If she has an important deadline with a client, I'll leave work early to grab the kids. 

I'm not looking for applause here. I just wanted to make it clear that I'm a very involved and selfless husband.

So on to the issues. We are currently in a vicious circle of blame and resentment that I don't see us being able to resolve. I feel that she shows almost zero interest in me. I feel invisible in this house. I feel like I'm nothing more than a paycheck and a roommate that takes mutual care of the children and household. She show's very little concern for anything going on in my life. It wasn't always this way. Just the passed year or so. 

Her side is that I'm not emotionally available to her. When she needs to vent or discuss her issues, I'm not a good listener and I act like I'm judging her or I don't really want to hear it.

The truth is: she's right. But let me explain.
My wife has anxiety and depression. She's on meds and was seeing a therapist last year but has since stopped that. She has some good days, but mostly bad. But the kicker here is she has been trauma dumping on me every day for 15 years. That's not an exaggeration. Every. Day. For 15 years. There is literally something wrong with her everyday. From physical ailments to emotional to mental, I've heard it everyday for 15 years. I'm tired y'all. I feel like I've got a heart of stone because I can't bring myself to care about her problems anymore. I feel guilty as hell about it, but I can't help it.

So back to the vicious circle. She says she's emotionally detached from me because of this, and that's why she shows little interest in me. And I say I act like the way I do because she and tired of the drama and trauma. We're at an impasse. 

I love her. But I'm unhappy. I have been for a while and I don't see that changing. I'm only getting older, and the only selfish thought throughout our entire relationship is: I deserve to be happy.

But divorce? What if I regret it and have to live with that forever? What about my kids? I grew up in a broken home and had a dad that wasn't in my life and promised myself I would never divorce like my parents did.

That's all I've got. I'll be happy to provide more details if asked. 

Also, FWIW, we tried marriage counseling last year. Three sessions. My wife was traumatized by it and isn't interested in going that route again.

I'm early 30s f and have found myself a bit isolated and sick of seeing the same old walls.
I was wondering if there was anyone who's in the same position, wants to meet new people, doesn't know where to start, or just wants to get out and do something different. I'd love to find some people to get together for coffee or adventures with. 

I'm located about 15 minutes out of Nambour. 

Feel free to message me! I'm all for commiseration.",5,1731047086.0,sunshinecoast,5,0.86,False

My dad and I have a rocky relationship to say the least. He’s a narcissist according to my mom, but I have no solid proof. I can say from the time I was a kid, he wouldn’t let me or my siblings score if we played games. I can remember he let my sisters bunny die because it was apparently her responsibility to feed it every day even after she moved out (for context my mom was forced to rent after they divorced because my dad owned the house, so there wasn’t space to house the bunny, my sister was 12). He also put out all of her stuff on the lawn when she decided to live with my mom to “make it easier”. When I was a teenager a lot of my depression and anxiety started to surface, and he called me Edward scissor hands in front of my friend (had I not try to end my own life this might of been slightly comedic in a dark way lol). 

Anyways, all that aside, I still chose to live with my dad full time after 12 because he was more stable than my mom, and I craved the stability. Around this time, he married my step mom and they had a kid, my little sister. I love my sister, we still talk, but everything became about her. I’m talking, I was special requested by the principal to be on the competitive girls basketball team but I was allowed because my parents would be too tired to drive me to practice. I would have band recitals, games, awards, etc and I think they showed up to a couple? All I ever heard was what I was doing wrong. Anyways, I put that aside and started to find solace in myself, but when I came out as gay it got weird. 

Initially, my parents were supportive, but then came the stipulations, and the comments. It’s not in the bible, I wasn’t allowed to sleep over for sports events because they “couldn’t trust me”, I wasn’t allowed to have my girlfriend in my room etc. Again, it wasn’t bad enough that I left. A few years later I came out as trans. I told my dad and he wanted me to wait until after university; I was heading into my first year of university after a year of college. He didn’t know how my step mom would react, he didn’t know how it would affect my little sister and didn’t want to tell her and he was worried she would be bullied. It was too much for me this time, so I left one night and left a note to try to explain. I ended up at my mom’s. 

My dad had been fronting the cash for my school at the time, and I was paying him back throughout the year. That got cut and so I had to apply for a loan, and with the help of my mom co-signing, I was able to afford school that year. With the help of my friends that year I learned how to apply to student aid which had better rates, so I could sustain myself at this point. During my school, I met my current partner; he’s a very to the point kind of guy and he made me aware of how my moms behaviour was having a negative impact on me, and after she showed up to our apartment one night wasted I had to cut her off. I had moved in with my partner at this point so it wasn’t complicated at least, though painful since I wasn’t talking to my dad much at this point either. 

Slowly I started to form a relationship with my dad again, and he seemed like he’d grown. My step mom apologized, she almost cried, and my dad and I owned up to not acting the best. Things seemed ok. I started coming over for coffees which was normal, I even went over for my little sisters birthday, but I haven’t been invited to any gatherings like thanksgiving or Christmas. I put this aside as just us smoothing our relationship over, but looking back I wonder if it’s because I’m trans/gay or something but I don’t know. 

So during this time, my money troubles began. I had been doing really well in university opportunity wise, but I was spread thin. I was working like crazy, volunteering, trying to keep my grades up etc. I couldn’t keep it up so I dropped out to get my finances in order. We were doing well, but my partner started to develop an alcohol dependency, and honestly if you’d been through we he’d been through you probably would too. His anxiety was pretty crippling as well, so alcohol helped him function. He lost his job during this time as well, and so I tried to step up. I had a decent job, and his grandma would help out occasionally so we were okay for a bit. Eventually his grandma slowly started to cut him off, and so I started working more. I picked up a side job doing conduction and started ubering. My partner was using this time to try to heal, but it felt like one bad thing would happen after another. His grandpa died, and his parents were shitty so his grandparents really stepped up to help raise him, so this was pretty crushing. His uncle started being vocal about how transphobic he was and started to pull his grandma away from him emotionally and financially. Then our car died and I had to finance a new vehicle. 

I was in over my head, swimming in debt, and not a clue how to get myself out of the hole I was digging. So I reached out to my dad, I wanted to know if he could help in any way. I felt okay asking because my dad wasn’t poor by any means, he owns 1.4 million dollar home that he bought for 600,000, they go on vacations every year, my sister goes to private school, etc. Essentially my dad told me that we’re all resonsonle for our decisions and if I can’t afford a dependent then I shouldn’t have one. Zero support and zero sympathy. I tried talking to my step mom, and she was sympathetic and said she would talk to dad but he didn’t budge. I tried again to explain my situation, and that i had potential but I just needed help and he said there just wasn’t anything he could do. 

I was chuffed, or upset for you non Canadians, and so I basically just told my dad that he needed to do some soul searching or we couldn’t have a relationship. I said my step mom and little sister could still talk to me cause they had done nothing wrong but I was trying to be a better man and I didn’t think my dad could help with that.
