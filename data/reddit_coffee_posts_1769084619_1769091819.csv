I’m a big fan who really loves GCGC, and I want to suggest a few features that I think need to be added ASAP. These are really important, so I’d really appreciate it if you could take a look!

1. Profile editing
2. Steam assistant / topping assistant
3. Free topping rearrangement + a wider counter layout (so we don’t have to scroll left/right as much)
4. When tapping a topping, show the topping name + how many times it’s been added
5. Drink takeout / packaging option
6. Add desserts
7. A “My Pad” screen like GPGP
8. Add friends
9. Increase coffee prices as shop interior/equipment upgrades improve (similar to how progression affects pricing)

Thanks for reading, and I really hope you’ll consider adding these features soon. GCGC has so much potential, and these changes would make the game way more enjoyable for everyone! 😊",2,1769091559.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,0,1.0,False

1qjvk30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qjvk30/my_shadow_follows_me_everywhere/,My shadow follows me everywhere,"I’ve always been afraid of the dark.

I know what you’re thinking, but it’s not like that. My fear isn’t in the typical way that most people are afraid. It’s not about monsters under the bed or things that go bump in the night. My fear is more specific than that. Probably more pathetic, really. I’m afraid of my own shadow.

I know how it sounds. Believe me, I’ve heard every joke, every dismissive comment you can come up with. I tried talking to my family, my partners, I even tried therapy, and they all chalked it up to some irrational fear or some manifestation of self-loathing as my therapist so delinquently put it. 

They’re all wrong.

It started when I was seven. I remember the exact moment because it was my birthday party, and my parents had rented one of those inflatable bounce houses for me and my friends. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across our backyard. Me and my friends had eaten too much cake and ice cream and were utilizing the last minutes of time we had with the bounce house. I was laughing, trying to do some dumb flip to show off when I looked down.

That’s the first time I saw it. 

My shadow was facing the wrong direction.

I froze, mid-jump and suspended in air for what felt like an eternity, but was probably only seconds, staring at the dark silhouette beneath me. Everyone else’s shadow stretched toward the fence, away from the dying sun. The way shadows were supposed to stretch. Mine pointed directly at me, like it was reaching up instead of being cast down.

When I landed, it snapped back to normal. I blinked, and it was fine, elongated toward the fence like everyone else’s, perfectly ordinary. I convinced myself I’d imagined it. I didn’t know anything about how shadows were supposed to work. Besides, seven-year-olds have active imaginations, right?

But then it happened again two weeks later. I was walking home from school, and I noticed my shadow lagging behind me. Not by much, maybe only half a step. But it was enough that when I stopped walking, it took a fraction of a second longer to stop too.

I started paying attention after that. Obsessively.

Most of the time, my shadow behaved normally. It did what shadows are supposed to do, it followed the rules of light and physics and all that rational, scientific shit that should have made me feel better but didn’t. Because every so often, maybe once a month, sometimes less, it would do something that felt off.

It would move independently, just for a second. Whether it be a twitch of the hand when mine were still, a tilt of the head when I was looking straight ahead, or a step that was just a fraction of a second too behind. Small things. Blink and you’ll miss it things.

Things that made me feel insane.

I learned to avoid certain lighting by the time I was on my own. Those overhead annoying fluorescent lights were the worst, they made my shadow pool directly beneath me, dense and dark, and I swear I could feel it watching me. Sounds ridiculous right? I started walking close to thewalls, staying in that kind of light where shadows got muddy and indistinct. I bought blackout curtains. I even stopped going outside after 4 PM in the winter, because the sun hung low and shadows stretched grotesque across the pavement.

My life became smaller and smaller, carved around the shape of my fear.

For years, I managed. I built a routine that minimized shadow exposure, and I almost convinced myself I was handling it. I got good at making excuses; I work night shifts, I’m sensitive to light, I prefer indoor activities. I would say anything to avoid my own shadow. And then, eventually, people stopped asking questions.

But three months ago, something changed.

I was at a coffee shop, a rare daytime outing because I’d run out of my medication and needed to get the refill before the pharmacy closed. The café had those big industrial windows, and the afternoon sun was streaming through, cutting harsh rectangular shadows across the floor. I was standing off to the side, staring at the menu board while I waited for my drink. 

That’s when I felt it.

That prickling awareness on the back of my neck, the goosebumps. That fight or flight sensation of being watched.

I looked down.

My shadow was facing me.

Not twisted around or pointing the wrong direction like when I was seven. It was standing in front of me, upright, head tilted up as if making eye contact, even though shadows don’t have eyes. They don’t have faces. They’re not supposed to have any features at all.

But I swear to god, mine was looking right at me.

I stumbled backward, knocking into the person behind me. They said something annoyed, but I couldn’t hear them over the rushing in my ears. When I looked down again, my shadow was normal. Behind me, where the light source dictated it should be. 

The barista called my name three times before I registered it.

I went home and didn’t leave again for two weeks. That’s when I started noticing it in my apartment too. In the lamplight, in the glow from my laptop screen, even in the faint illumination my phone gave off at night. My shadow started showing up where it shouldn’t.

On walls I wasn’t facing. In mirrors, moving in my peripheral vision. Once, I saw it in the kitchen when I was in the bedroom, a clear, distinct silhouette passing across the wall like someone walking through a room.

I stopped turning on lights unless absolutely necessary. I bought more blackout curtains., started sleeping during the day and staying awake at night because darkness felt safer than the unreliable shadows cast by artificial light.

And it was great, at first. Because the thing about darkness is, you can’t have shadows without light. That’s what I thought. That’s what I was counting on.

I was wrong.

Last week, I woke up at 3 AM. My room was pitch black. There was no streetlights through my many blackout curtains, no electronics glowing, absolutely nothing. No light. The kind of dark where you can’t even see your hand in front of your face.

And as my eyes adjusted I saw my shadow on the wall.

Impossible right? That’s what I thought too. There’s no light source. Shadows can’t exist without light. That’s like, basic physics or whatever. That’s just how the world works.

But there it was. Darker than the surrounding darkness, which shouldn’t be possible but was. A human shaped boid of nothingness standing next to my bed, perfectly still.

I didn’t move, couldn’t even breathe. I just stared at it, and it stared back. That was when I realized something, with horrible certainty, that it had never needed light at all. The light was for my benefit, to trick me, to disguise what it really was. To make it seem normal and explainable so I wouldn’t question it. 

In the complete absence of light, I could finally see it clearly.

It wasn’t my shadow. It had never been my shadow.

It was something else, something that had been following me since I was seven, disguising itself as the natural phenomenon of a shadow. Hiding in plain sight.

I’ve been sitting here in my dark room for six days now. I haven’t eaten. Haven’t slept. I’m typing this on my phone with the brightness turned all the way down, and I refuse to look away from the screen because I’m terrified of what I’ll see.

But the thing is, I can feel it in here with me. In the corner. By the door. Sometimes right next to me, close enough that it feels like that particular warmth of a body next to you…except shadows don’t radiate temperature. 

I don’t know what it wants. I don’t know why it chose me. I don’t know if it’s been waiting all these years for me to finally acknowledge it, to see it for what it really is.

But I can hear it now.

Not with my ears, it doesn’t make any real sound. But I can hear it the way you hear your own thoughts, like it’s speaking directly into my brain.

It’s saying the same thing, over and over:

“Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.”

And the worst part about it, the part that’s made me finally decide to post this before I do what I know I’m going to do, is that I want to look. There’s something almost seductive about it, something that makes me want to turn my head and meet its gaze directly, even though I know with absolute certainty that if I do, I won’t be me anymore.

I’ll be it.

Or maybe it’ll be me.

Maybe that has always been the goal, and if I look, maybe I’ll understand why it’s been following me all these years. Why it chose me.

My phone battery is at 3%. When it dies, I’ll be in complete darkness again.

And I think this time, I’m going to look.

I’m going to turn my head and stare directly at the thing that’s been with me my entire life, and I’m going to finally understand what I am.

What we are.

If you’re reading this, and you’ve ever felt like your shadow wasn’t quite right, if it’s moved wrong, or lingered too long, or been somewhere it shouldn’t…

Don’t look at it.

Whatever you do, don’t acknowledge it.

Because once you see it, once you really see it, it sees you too.

This is my first Cardamonth and thought I'd write down my thoughts after my first testing, knowing that these will develop and settle a bit more.

**My likes:** I'm still figuring this out, LOL. From Poesie, favs are ***Montmartre***, ***Velvet Moon***, ***Dream Crystal***. I have also enjoyed ***Titania, Eat Me, Birch Please***. A lot of Poesie scents are fine to smell for me, but not necessarily wearable. So ***Oyster!*** is cool, would never wear it. Same with ***Enchanted Forest***. Love the artistry, but at a distance.

**My dislikes:** There's a quality I try to name, but basically anything that smells like a Hallmark store. Tends to be very powdery, unbalanced florals. That and too much citrus reads like bathroom cleaner for me. I originally tried Poesie for ***Full Moon (at the Temple)*** and that yuzu note was like a spike to my sinuses \*sad noises\*.

***Aphrodite's Breakfast:*** *sweet milk bread soaked in cardamom and pandan leaf infused custard, caramelized buttery edges, a dainty cup of jasmine green tea* 

* I was most excited by this and found myself a little deflated (but perhaps this is good news to you!) There's a green powdery note that's found in ***Green Girl*** that shows up in this (or at least my nose reads it the same). Right now, it's too sweet for me plus the green powdery note.

***Comfort:*** *toasted cardamom pods, pink peppercorn, precious resins, sandalwood flower, cashmere blankets, warm vanilla musk*

* After u/TeaAndCozy talked this up, I was intrigued and I remain so! The resins in this are very interesting and reminds me of something from 20+ years ago that a flatmate would wear all the time? This is one I'll have to live with a bit to see if it grows on me.

***Weighted Blanket:*** *cozy vanilla musk, warm cardamom, airy vanilla bean, your favorite fluffy blanket, freshly laundered linen sheets*

* This one did odd things on my skin, wavering from dreamy to Yankee Candle. I'm thinking for me the linen note is what's not living well on my skin. But the whiffs of good are good enough to wait and test. I wonder if I'd like it best on someone else.

***Dolce Far Niente:*** *cardamom, caramelized pastry, pistachio paste, creamy vanilla-infused mascarpone layered with coffee-soaked cookies, soft milk chocolate*

* Sniffing in the sampler, this was a hard no. Too heavy a gourmand for me. On my skin, it's been a journey, like having three different fragrances. It's dried down to a sweet chocolatey moment that just isn't for me but it may be wonderful for you!

***Glimmers:*** *ambery vanilla laced with mystical white sage, cardamom, pinyon pine, warm desert spices, dry woods*

* This started out with a bang, very strong pinyon pine and woody. It screams desert in all caps. The dry down becomes way more creamy, the sage starts showing up. This was the longest lasting scent and now 8 hours later, it's sweet and herbal. 

My initial ranking:   
Most likely will wear: ***Glimmers***  
Consistent testing: ***Comfort*** and ***Weighted Blanket***  
Will wait to see if they calm down: ***Aphrodite's Breakfast*** and ***Dolce Far Niente***

I wake him up the 1 million times it takes before he actually wakes the hell up and starts drinking his coffee, except he wakes up mad because I woke him up too late and now he doesn't have time to watch TV and enjoy his coffee.

I explain that I start waking him up once the coffee is made because he complains if it's not ready first and I keep forgetting to set the coffee pit up the night before so I have to set it up and wait for it to brew. 

I then said I tell you what, how about you set up the coffee pot at night so that'll be ready when I wake up and then I can wake you up ""on time"". 

he took that and said well the issue is you don't remember to set it up, so why don't you set an alarm to remind you? 

I got frustrated and said I was asking him to take care of it so I don't have to remember. 

to which he just kept circling and saying he didn't understand. The issue is that I keep forgetting, and the resolution is setting an alarm. 

We just went in frustrating circles where he kept saying he didn't understand what the issue was with setting an alarm so I wouldn't forget, thus fixing the issue.

**GREENWICH**

**Greenwich is getting a new Superloop bus**  
The SL11 will run between Abbey Wood and North Greenwich starting Saturday, and rides are FREE for the first week.

Now, this isn’t an entirely new route. The SL11 is replacing the 472, but with faster service aiming to speed up connections to the Elizabeth line, the DLR and the tube. In fact, the bus is supposed to run every six minutes.

Unfortunately, as this acts as an express service, some stops that were on the 472 route won’t be on the SL11.

**LEWISHAM**

**Goldsmiths University is coming to Catford**  
The university’s Fine Art and Design department will be taking over Lewisham’s Old Town Hall as its new campus by 2027.

This is a really exciting development for Catford’s ongoing regeneration plans, including affordable housing and new commercial space.

1qjvbo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1qjvbo3/all_the_main_meanings_and_uses_of_the_spanish/,"All the Main Meanings and Uses of the Spanish Verb ""Echar""","Echar is a very common and versatile Spanish verb, but because it has so many meanings, uses, and fixed expressions, it often confuses learners. So in this post, I’ve broken down all its main meanings to help you understand and remember them, and use this verb correctly.

**ECHAR**

1.1. To throw / to toss / to dump

Use echar when you’re putting something somewhere in a quick, casual way, especially when it involves throwing it away or dropping it in a place.

* Echa la carta en el buzón. → Put the letter in the mailbox.
* Echa esto a la basura. → Throw this in the trash.
* Echó la pelota al agua. → He threw the ball into the water.

1.2. To add / to pour (ingredients, liquids, etc.)

This meaning is super common in everyday Spanish, especially when cooking or adding something to food or drinks.

* Échale sal a la comida. → Add salt to the food.
* Voy a echar un poco de leche. → I’m going to pour a bit of milk.
* Échale azúcar al café. → Add sugar to the coffee.

1.3. To kick out / to fire / to throw out

This one is very common too. It means someone gets forced out of a place or removed from a job.

* Lo echaron del trabajo. → They fired him.
* Lo echaron del bar. → They kicked him out of the bar.
* Me echó de casa. → He/She kicked me out of the house.

1.4. To take (time) / to spend (time doing something) 

If you want to say how long something took, Spanish often uses echar + time + en + infinitive.

* Eché dos horas en llegar. → It took me two hours to get there.
* ¿Cuánto echaste en hacerlo? → How long did it take you to do it?

This usage is especially common in Spain, and a more universal alternative is tardar.

ECHAR**SE** 

2.1. To start doing something suddenly

Echarse a + infinitive is used when someone suddenly starts doing something, often a reaction (often emotional or unexpected).

* Se echó a reír. → He/She burst out laughing.
* Me eché a llorar. → I started crying.
* Se echaron a correr. → They started running.

2.2. To lie down / to lean back

This is a very natural way to describe someone lying down on a sofa/bed, or leaning back in a chair.

* Me eché en el sofá un rato. → I lay down on the sofa for a while.
* Se echó hacia atrás en la silla. → He leaned back in the chair.

2.3. To put on / to apply (cream, perfume, etc.)

Use echarse when you’re talking about putting a product on your body, like cream, lotion, sunscreen, perfume, gel, etc.

* Me echo crema después de ducharme. → I put on cream after showering.
* Échate un poco de perfume. → Put on some perfume.

3 . **Fixed expressions**

1 . Echar de menos → to miss

* Te echo de menos desde que te fuiste. → I miss you since you left.

2 . Echar un vistazo / una mirada / un ojo → to take a look

* Échale un vistazo a este mensaje cuando puedas. → Take a look at this message when you can.

3 . Echar una mano → to help

* ¿Me echas una mano con las bolsas, por favor? → Can you give me a hand with the bags, please?

4 . Echar la culpa (a alguien) → to blame

* No me eches la culpa a mí, tú también llegaste tarde. → Don’t blame me, you were late too.

5 . Echar raíces → to settle down

6 . Echar humo → to be furious / to smoke

* Cuando se enteró de la mentira, estaba echando humo. → When he found out about the lie, he was furious.

7 . Echar chispas → to be furious (very strong)

I wanted to share an update in case it helps someone, or even just to document where I’m at.
It’s been almost 3 years since I’ve been dealing with Long COVID. I’ve specifically been an LCI sufferer since January 2023. I’m not recovered, but I’ve noticed one meaningful change recently that feels worth sharing.
What symptoms I still have
My primary symptoms that remain are:
Fatigue
Post-exertional malaise (PEM)
Mild brain fog (I especially notice it while driving)
Stiff neck — this has reduced over time, but it’s still present to some extent
These have been stubborn and ongoing.
POTS / heart rate update (possible improvement)
For the past 2–3 years, my heart rate would shoot up to 110–115 bpm on standing almost consistently.
Over the last ~2 weeks, I’ve noticed:
Standing HR is now more around 85–90 bpm
Sometimes even 65–75 bpm
Overall, much lower and calmer compared to before
Because of this, I think my POTS-like symptoms may be improving, though I’m very cautious about saying “resolved.”
What I changed recently
Over the last 20–25 days, I made two main changes:
Completely stopped caffeine
I used to have milk tea every morning after drinking ~750 ml of water on an empty stomach
Before COVID, I was a black coffee drinker
I’ve now cut out all caffeine
Started an Ayurvedic herb (Arjun chhaal) IMPORTANT - The change in heart rate was instant like after 5-10 mins
Here in India, it’s called Arjun chhaal (Terminalia arjuna bark)
Costs around ₹20–30 per packet
Traditionally used for heart health and endothelial function
I’m not claiming this is a cure — just sharing what I personally tried
Important caveat
I know symptoms can come back, and this improvement has only been for 20–25 days, so I’m staying realistic. But after years of high heart rate on standing, even this change feels like a small step forward.
I’m hopeful that, with time, PEM, fatigue, and brain fog may also slowly improve.
Wishing strength and healing to everyone here.
If anyone finds this helpful, I’ll be happy to post updates and keep contributing to the sub.

1qjvaok,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1qjvaok/new_town_lizi_rachel_and_a_viper/,New Town Lizi Rachel and a viper,"The morning sun filtered through the broad leaves of the garden on the town square, casting dappled patterns across the wrought-iron table where Elizabeth and Rachel sat with steaming mugs of coffee. The air carried the faint scent of blooming night jasmine and the distant clang of hammers from New Town’s ongoing construction—reminders that the barony was growing, one stone and timber at a time.

It had only been a few days since Elizabeth had shared bourbon and cigars with Jeff and the Sergeant Major ar the rmtsbke feet up , swapping stories of old campaigns and newer alliances. The memory lingered like good smoke: easy laughter, the burn of aged liquor, the quiet respect between soldiers and civilians who had seen enough to value peace.

Now, though, the garden felt softer, more intimate. Rachel leaned back in her chair, cradling her mug, a dreamy smile playing on her lips.

“I can’t wait for Wyatt to get back,” she said, eyes sparkling. “The Nori-Navio been gone too long chasing traitors or pirates at. Space feels empty without him around.”

Elizabeth’s cup paused halfway to her mouth. She studied Rachel over the rim, a knowing glint in her eye.

“Every time someone mentions Wyatt, you blush like a first-year cadet.”

Rachel’s cheeks pinked on cue. She laughed, setting her mug down.

“Well, I’m not the only one, Lizi. You do it too.”

Both women dissolved into giggles, the sound bright against the quiet morning. Elizabeth fanned herself dramatically with one hand.

“You know, Rach—even if Wyatt wasn’t a noble, he could have any woman in New Town wrapped around his finger. That quiet strength, those eyes… gods.”

Rachel nodded fervently. Any woman lucky to catch his eye . She will not have to worry about him looking at  other women . You can tell he is a one woman man Honest and loyal. 

“I agree. If he asked, I’d be with him in a second.” She paused, tilting her head. “Though Declan’s really cute and I like him But a woman has to be practical. Who provides best? Who builds something lasting?” Provides for the family “ kids” 

“Totally agree,” Elizabeth said, smiling into her coffee.

Rachel’s expression turned mischievous.

“The other night was fun—bourbon, cigars, all that—but what would make it even better? Some of that moonweed you were talking about.”

Elizabeth’s eyebrows shot up.

“Are you busy right now?”

“Not really.”

“Well then.” Elizabeth set her mug aside with decision. “Let’s go now. The best patches are up at the old mansion. There’s construction on the new homes in case the Staples decide to settle here. Lili has troops stationed—Lili Bauer, I mean. We’ll hitch a ride.”

Rachel stood, brushing imaginary crumbs from her skirt.

“I’ll grab boots and commoner clothes. Be back in ten.”

“Go. I’ll arrange transport.”

Rachel hurried off toward her nearby lodgings. Elizabeth pulled out her data pad and tapped a quick message to Sergeant Lili Bauer.

Heading your way to the old mansion shortly. Need a lift up? Just foraging a bit. Nothing official.

Ten minutes later, a small electric utility vehicle—more pickup than passenger rig—rolled up to the garden gate, driven by a young corporal with a polite nod.

“Ladies,” he said. “Sergeant Bauer sent me. Hop in.”

Elizabeth and Rachel climbed aboard, the vehicle humming quietly as it trundled out of New Town and up the winding dirt track toward the old mansion. The forest thickened around them—towering trees of the Screaming Forest, leaves whispering in the breeze. The mansion loomed ahead, half-ruined grandeur now partially scaffolded for repairs, the site where Wyatt had once faced down a Drazzan in single combat. Guards patrolled the perimeter; construction crews hammered away at future residences.

A corporal waved them over as they parked.

“Sergeant Bauer said you were coming. Need an escort?”

Elizabeth smiled.

“We’ll stay fairly close—inside the timber line near the mansion. If we wander too far, we’ll call. We’re good for now.”

“Yes, ma’am.” He saluted crisply.

The two women set off into the shaded woods, boots crunching on fallen leaves. The air grew cooler, scented with moss and earth.

“Rachel—over here!” Elizabeth called softly after a few minutes.

Rachel jogged over, excited.

Elizabeth knelt beside a cluster of slender plants with silvery-green leaves and delicate purple-white flowers.

“This is moonweed. We just want the flowers—the buds especially. They dry fast and pack a gentle lift. Helps with tea, medicine… or a quiet smoke.”

They spent the next half-hour wandering, picking carefully, filling small cloth bags. Elizabeth pointed out other plants—bitterroot for headaches, silverleaf for poultices—while Rachel chattered happily.

Then Rachel let out a sharp scream.

“Elizabeth! Elizabeth!”

Elizabeth rushed over. Rachel stood frozen, clutching a stick she’d picked up, poised over a coiled serpent—slender, patterned in warm browns and creams, tongue flicking lazily.

Elizabeth burst out laughing.

“Rachel, it’s not venomous. That’s a cornflake viper. Harmless—great for keeping rodents down. They’re friendly little things.”

Rachel lowered the stick, still wide-eyed.

“You’re sure? It looks… ready to strike.”

“Positive. Even if it bit you, it’d just be a nip—no harm. They usually slither off when startled. See? She’s already heading that way—probably back to her nest. Leave her be.”

Rachel exhaled, shaky laugh escaping.

“Gods, I thought I was done for.”

About that moment, the corporal and two other soldiers came jogging up, rifles at the ready.

“Ma’ams! You okay?”

Rachel waved them off.

“Fine—just a cornflake viper. Elizabeth explained. All good.”

The corporal relaxed.

“You’re sure?”

“Positive. Could you call us a ride back to New Town?”

“Yes, ma’am. One on the way.”

Minutes later, another EV arrived. The ride down was filled with laughter—Rachel reenacting her scream, Elizabeth teasing her mercilessly.

Back at the garden, Elizabeth spread their haul on her work table under the pergola.

“Let’s process this out here—no mess inside.”

Rachel eyed the fresh moonweed buds.

“How do we roll it?”

Elizabeth pulled a small tin from a drawer.

“I have dried mint leaves—perfect wrapper. Adds a cool flavor.”

She crushed the buds gently, mixed in a pinch of mint, and showed Rachel how to roll a neat, fat cigar. Rachel tried one, tongue poking out in concentration.

“Needs a light.”

Elizabeth fetched a slim plasma lighter—discreet, reliable.

“It’s green still, so it won’t burn perfectly. But it’ll do.”

They settled on a bench overlooking the square. Elizabeth lit the end, took a slow pull—smooth, herbal smoke curling up, carrying a faint sweet-earth note with mint undertones. She passed it to Rachel.

Rachel inhaled cautiously, coughed once, then smiled.

“Nice. Gentle buzz coming on.”

Their data pads pinged simultaneously.

Aino’s message: Council meeting. Need both of you at City Hall. Urgent.

The women exchanged glances.

“We can finish this tonight on the beach,” Elizabeth said, stubbing out the cigar carefully to save the rest.

Rachel nodded, tucking the remainder into her pocket.

“Deal.”

They stood, brushing off leaves, still giggling softly from the morning’s adventure and the lingering haze of moonweed.

New Town waited—council, duties, the slow build of a barony—but for now, the garden held the echo of friendship, secrets, and the promise of more stolen moments under the stars. With  Bourbon and Cigars

You still check your phone hoping for her name to appear. Your mom says ""just make new friends"" like you lost a gym buddy... not someone who knew your coffee order, your worst fears, and every embarrassing story from school.  Your brain is processing this loss the same way it processes death. Not metaphorically. Literally. The same neural pathways. The same grief patterns. The same biological response. 

Science just proved what you already felt but everyone else dismissed. 

Your brain treats friendship breakups like death because, neurologically speaking, they are a death the death of shared identity, daily rituals, future plans, and a version of yourself that can't exist without that person. 

The question isn't why it hurts this much. The question is: now that science validates what you've felt all along, what changes? How do we rebuild a life when the grief is real, the loss is legitimate, and the pain isn't in your head... it's in your neural pathways? 

Maybe it starts by trusting what your brain has been screaming all along: this loss matters. Your grief is real. And healing requires the same time, space, and support we give any other form of bereavement. ",1,1769090432.0,FriendshipHealing,0,1.0,False

# 📰 News in your borough

**GREENWICH**  
  
**Greenwich is getting a new Superloop bus**  
The SL11 will run between Abbey Wood and North Greenwich starting Saturday, and rides are FREE for the first week.

Now, this isn’t an entirely new route. The SL11 is replacing the 472, but with faster service aiming to speed up connections to the Elizabeth line, the DLR and the tube. In fact, the bus is supposed to run every six minutes.

Unfortunately, as this acts as an express service, some stops that were on the 472 route won’t be on the SL11.

**LEWISHAM**  
  
**Goldsmiths University is coming to Catford**  
The university’s Fine Art and Design department will be taking over Lewisham’s Old Town Hall as its new campus by 2027.

This is a really exciting development for Catford’s ongoing regeneration plans, including affordable housing and new commercial space.

Goldsmiths is expected to sign a 10-year lease.",2,1769090268.0,lewisham,1,1.0,False

No packed boardwalks. No rushing to claim a spot in the sand. Just cooler air, wide-open beaches, and that steady sound of the waves that somehow feels louder when everything else slows down.

I’ve noticed winter trips tend to feel more intentional — morning coffee on the balcony, long walks along the shoreline, sunsets you don’t feel rushed to catch. Even simple things like grabbing seafood or watching the tide roll in feel more relaxed.

Curious how others feel about off-season beach trips:

* Do you prefer the calm of winter or the energy of summer?
* Any favorite winter beach rituals?
* Anything you actually *miss* when the crowds are gone?

1qjv4n4,https://i.redd.it/zoszkhjzoweg1.jpeg,The Weight We Carry in the Name of Independence,"Independence can sometimes feel like a burden. In today’s world, irrespective of gender, we have become so fiercely independent that even something as simple as allowing someone to pay for a meal feels uncomfortable. This independence has turned everyday life into a series of calculations—from a small coffee date to a long trip, from buying a dress to gifting one.

Gifting itself often feels transactional. We give wedding gifts to friends not purely out of joy, but with the unspoken thought that when our turn comes, the gesture will be returned. Everything appears measured and balanced. Friendships, corporate relationships, and even family bonds are not spared from this quiet accounting.

In some households, children are forced into independence at a very young age, taking responsibility for their parents long before they are emotionally ready. They do it sincerely, trying to play the role of a responsible, independent adult. Yet, even they sometimes need someone to do something for them—without expecting anything in return.

Every relationship seems to come with a price. If a sister buys you something, you feel compelled to buy something in return. If a friend, a boy or a girl, does something for you, there is an unspoken obligation to reciprocate. This raises a simple but heavy question: who are the people who give without expectations?

Sometimes, I too wish for someone to buy me a cup of tea, a dress, or something I quietly long for—someone who would fulfill these small wishes without calculations, without returns, and without expectations. Perhaps the hope is that we all become such people, capable of fulfilling small needs and wishes for others, purely out of care, and nothing more.",1,1769090059.0,u_birjis_khatoon,0,1.0,False

1qjv25d,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewAuthor/comments/1qjv25d/here_is_a_little_more_of_house/,Here is a little more of 'House',"CHAPTER 2

Natalia and Eddie had built a small, imperfect, fiercely loving life together. Two kids — teenagers now — who carried pieces of their parents in ways neither of them fully understood yet.

Natalie, the older one, had her mother's quiet intensity. She saw everything, even the things adults thought they were hiding. Eddie Jr., named without hesitation the moment his father held him in the hospital, had his father's stubbornness and his mother's smile. The name had felt like a promise back then — a way of anchoring the boy to something solid, something proud.

But after the accident, the name felt heavier. Like Eddie Sr. had passed down not just his identity, but his grief.

The official report said the 25‑year‑old driver from Ecorse wasn't at fault. Wrong place, wrong second, wrong angle. But that didn't erase the fact that he'd spilled hot coffee on his lap, or that Nickelback was blasting so loud he couldn't have heard a bomb go off beside him. It didn't erase the fact that Natalia's Caprice never stood a chance.

His CDL was suspended. He was ordered into driver‑responsibility courses. But he went home at the end of the day. Natalia didn't.

The company he drove for — Downriver Hauling & Logistics Inc. — wasn't so lucky. Investigators dug into their books, their maintenance logs, their hiring practices. What they found wasn't criminal negligence, but it was enough: corner‑cutting, outdated equipment, safety protocols treated like suggestions. The kind of small‑company rot that grows in the shadow of bigger industries.

Downriver Hauling was charged, fined, and eventually shut down. Their yard on Jefferson sat empty for months afterward, the chain‑link fence rattling in the wind, the faded logo on the office trailer peeling like sunburnt skin. Locals said it felt haunted, but not by ghosts — by the weight of everything that had gone wrong.

For the Jones kids, the world didn't end in one moment. It ended in slow, uneven collapses.

Natalie stopped riding in cars unless she absolutely had to. Eddie Jr. started wearing his headphones everywhere, blasting music loud enough to drown out the memory of the police officer who came to the door. Eddie Sr. tried to hold them together, but he was already unraveling himself — grief mixing with unemployment, depression mixing with the heat of that sweltering July.

The house felt too quiet without Natalia's voice. Too big without her presence. Too small for all the pain inside it.

And Fort Street kept moving, trucks roaring past the gas station like nothing had happened.



  
CHAPTER 3

After the accident and the layoff, Natalia's parents stepped in the way grandparents do when the world suddenly becomes too heavy for their children to carry. They picked up Natalie and Eddie Jr. without hesitation, folding them into their home like they were trying to protect them from the sharp edges of reality. Eddie didn't fight it. He couldn't. He knew he wasn't steady enough to give them what they needed, not with grief chewing at him from the inside and the shutdown stripping away the last bit of structure he had left.

He could see them whenever he wanted — that was the agreement — but even that came with a quiet strain. Every visit was a reminder of what he'd lost, what he couldn't provide, what he feared he might never get back. The kids tried to be brave for him, but teenagers aren't built to hide everything. Natalie's eyes carried a watchfulness that didn't belong on someone her age. Eddie Jr. clung to humor like a life raft, but even his jokes had a hollow ring.

Back at his house, the silence was a living thing.

The kitchen table — once the center of their small universe — had become a graveyard of old newspapers, unpaid bills, junk mail, and job applications that went nowhere. The clutter grew in slow, creeping layers, the way mold spreads in the dark. Dinner plates hadn't been set out in weeks. Silverware stayed in the drawer. The chairs sat empty, untouched, like they were waiting for a family that wasn't coming home.

The laughter that used to bounce off the walls had been replaced by the hum of the refrigerator and the occasional thump of Eddie dropping another envelope onto the pile. He was doing what he could — small side jobs, odd repairs, anything that paid enough to keep the lights on for another week. But every rejection letter, every ""we'll keep your résumé on file,"" every closed door chipped away at him.

The depression didn't announce itself. It didn't storm in. It seeped. Quietly. Patiently. Filling the spaces between his thoughts. Turning the house into something that felt less like a home and more like a waiting room for a life he wasn't sure he'd get back.

And through it all, he kept telling himself he just needed time. Time to figure things out. Time to breathe. Time to be strong enough to bring his kids home again.

But time, like everything else that summer, felt unbearably heavy.

\- Weekend cuddles and lazy mornings

\- Evening coffee shop reading dates

\- Random road trips and hitting the gym together

\- Holding hands at the farmer’s market or snuggling in a hammock (I’m super affectionate in private and in public).

I'm an inquisitive person, so I tend to ask a lot of questions. I don't mind calling whenever you're comfortable because conversations typically flow better that way for me.

I’m open to long-distance relationships (in the US only), but my ultimate goal is for us to eventually move in together, relocation to me is ideal.

I'll probably only respond if your open to sharing a pic within the first message or two so we can see if the attraction is mutual, i do have preferences for partners who have are slim/thin or lean towards the athletic/fit side and ideally over 25 but not a deal breaker.

We have been together 6 years. I had deep trust issues going into the relationship but over time I have learned to trust him with all the important stuff. He’s loyal and not afraid to hurt my feelings. For example he will tell me if the dinner I cooked wasn’t very good, or if something I’m wearing doesn’t look great. He does it politely though, and I appreciate that. 

There are times where things don’t make sense though, and it’s always something that doesn’t really matter. A repeated example is if something happens in the night he will claim to not remember it, even though we talked in the night and I can’t understand how he can’t remember when he was so alert. Or I ask him if he’s done something around the house and he says yes, come to find it looks like he didn’t. And he’ll say “well I thought I did”. Or he took a sip of my coffee and I asked him if he drank some and he’ll quickly say “no” and I was like but I just saw you? And he’ll say something like he didn’t realize that he did it. Little things like that. They just don’t make sense. 

I truly believe he hasn’t lied to me about any major things. These little white lies don’t seem intentional to me, it’s almost like there just isn’t much thought into his answers sometimes before he says it. 

Is this common? Raise red flags?

Last year, I have massively struggled with addiction, I don't even remember most of 2025. By the end of December, I thought that maybe I should get my life back in track; one small step at a time:

\- **Journaling**: I can't say this enough, this is the single thing that changed my life. I write about things that I'm grateful for, even the smallest ones (my bed, heated blanket lol), talk about the things I'm ashamed of. It has become my number 1 confidant. 

\- **I started saying yes to plans**: instead of staying at home thinking about how miserable I am, I have started saying yes to random plans (dance classes, social dinners, random coffee walks during the day, Sunday roast, new gym class, small music gigs..). and what a pleasure it has been to socialise this year - realising that all people struggle with a certain something made my problems look even smaller. 

\- **I do one small new thing per day**: nothing major, just for example cooking a new dish, trying a new drink, new snack, driving a new road.. life doesn't have to be big and explosive - happiness is a peaceful and boring journey.

\- **I picked up reading again**: mothing major, just some nice classics, and I try to make progress on my 30 days book challenge for 2026.

\- **I don't take work to heart**: one of the biggest sources of my anxiety and depression last year was work. I have realised that my goal in life is no longer to have a ""career"" as I know it. I don't want to go up the ladder anymore. I want to go back home, disconnect from work, and enjoy my actual life (travels, friends, music, etc)

  
And most importantly, I'm content with my past, my present and what I have. I'm so very thankful for both the bad and good experiences that I have lived.",4,1769089565.0,selfimprovement,2,1.0,False

I started with an epic bag & a legendary Armor + Weapons all at 20% health so their value was at their lowest, making the total starting price of the loadout at roughly 2.5M.

Went in solo so no teammates to steal good loot lol

Started at beach 🥲 but Took down a squad there who challenged me at the Beach safe.where I found a legendary bag and another legendary vest👌🏻

Went to the Hotel area where I got 1 unlooted safe but only legendary items inside where I heard someone fighting nearby and went to check. there were two players who I killed and luckily found 2 Mythic Armors and a bunch of legendary loot!

So I yoinked and went to check the hotel but it was all looted most likely by them, then headed towards the ship to find some extra legendary badges or mythics but it was all looted except for a couple of hazmat suit pockets which gave me a mythic finally. I got over 8M worth of loot so I rushed back to the final helicopter and barely made it with 20 seconds left!! 🫣😆

1qjux1g,https://simplifybudget.com/,My coworker saved every penny for early retirement. I stayed broke. We were both idiots.,"K made $65,000 a year and had $200 in his account by day 20 of every month.

His coworker Jeff made the same salary and had $47,000 saved. Jeff brought lunch in Tupperware every day. Jeff drove a 2009 Corolla. Jeff hadn't been to a restaurant in 8 months because he was ""retiring at 45.""

K thought saving money meant becoming Jeff.

So he never tried.

**K's logic was airtight (and stupid):**

Either save every penny like Jeff and retire early, or just live your life and stay broke.

Those were the only two options. Saving meant sacrifice. Saving meant boring. Saving meant Tupperware.

K chose broke.

**Jeff was a squirrel storing nuts he'd never eat.**

Retirement calculators. Compound interest spreadsheets. That dopamine hit watching his portfolio grow while eating the same goddamn chicken breast meal prep for the 847th time.

His big dream? Maybe take a trip in 2045. If the market cooperates. If he still has knees.

**K was a hamster on a paycheck wheel.**

Every two weeks: money appeared, rent ate half, bills ate a quarter, the rest evaporated into restaurants and Amazon boxes he couldn't remember ordering.

Day 20: panic. Day 25: credit card. Day 1: repeat.

Zero savings. Zero plan. Just hoping nothing breaks.

Both guys were miserable. Different cages, same zoo.

**Then K read something that broke his brain.**

Not ""save for retirement."" Not ""sacrifice now, live later.""

Just: *Save 2 years of expenses.*

Two years. Not 25 years of retirement savings. Just enough runway to quit a job you hate without immediately panicking about rent.

K did the math. His rent, bills, food, everything: $3,200/month.

Two years: $76,800.

Not impossible. Not Jeff-level frugality. Just... possible.

**So K tried something radical: he tracked his spending without restricting it.**

Week one: $340 on food. Four $18 lunches. Three dinners out.

He didn't stop going out. He just became aware he was going out.

Week two: brought lunch twice. Saved $36. Went to a concert. Didn't feel guilty because he knew he could afford it.

But then K discovered the cheat code.

**Saving wasn't the game. Earning was.**

Instead of cutting his lifestyle to save money, he got better at his job. Learned new skills. Became more valuable.

Year one: $65k → $72k  
Year two: $72k → $85k  
Year three: $85k → $95k

Same restaurants. Same lifestyle. Different bank account.

Three years later: $115,000 saved. Three years of runway.

**Then K did what he always wanted to do.**

Quit corporate. Traveled. Took freelance projects he actually liked. Worked from beaches and coffee shops and wherever the hell he wanted.

Jeff was still eating Tupperware, still refreshing his portfolio, still waiting for 2045.

K was living the life Jeff was saving for.

**Here's the part that shocked K:**

The three-year cushion didn't disappear.

He thought once he quit his job and started freelancing, the money would evaporate. That he'd burn through savings and end up back at corporate within a year.

But he kept tracking. Kept being aware. Made money freelancing. Spent money traveling.

The cushion stayed. Sometimes it grew. Sometimes it dipped. But it never disappeared.

Because he wasn't broke-K anymore. He wasn't running blind. He knew his numbers.

**Five years later:**

K has worked in six countries. Never returned to corporate. Still has three years runway. Still goes out. Still lives his actual life.

Jeff is still at the same desk, still eating Tupperware, still dreaming about 2045.

**The lesson K learned:**

Being broke traps you. Being Jeff also traps you.

Freedom isn't choosing between sacrifice and chaos.

Freedom is: earn more, maintain lifestyle, build runway, then do whatever you want.

Two years minimum. Three years ideal. Not retirement savings. Just enough cushion to tell any boss to shove it.

Track your money. Not to restrict it. To be aware of it.

Then get better at earning it.

Then buy your freedom.",1,1769089520.0,AwesomeBudgeting,0,1.0,False

I’ve tried to keep a tight colour palette: green, blue, purple-red, brown, and white, pulling colours from the embroidered artwork. My husband’s grandmother is moving into assisted living and we took her coffee table (supposedly it was a piece of art she had made into a coffee table) and the embroidered chairs (pics 3 and 4). I had already taken the silver tray (it’s tin I think) from her when she moved from her condo into a small apartment. The pink candy dish on the tray was hers as well (pics 5).

Why is this Moon Special?  
The full moon in October is historically known as the Harvest Moon because it is the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox, providing extended evening light for farmers to harvest their crops. In 2025, this coincided with the Moon being near its perigee (closest point to Earth), earning it the classification of a Supermoon or Perigean Full Moon. This combination made the October Full Moon 2025 a truly memorable sight, especially for those viewing it from the Eastern Seaboard.  
  
Video Details & Filming Location:  
Filmed entirely in 4K resolution at a highly scenic vantage point on the Northeast U.S. coast (specifically overlooking the Atlantic Ocean). The time-lapse sequence compresses hours of celestial movement into just a few minutes of breathtaking footage.  
  
Date Captured: October 6, 2025  
  
Location: Northeast Coast, USA (Exact coordinates withheld for privacy, but captured from a coastal vantage point).

1qjup4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qjup4e/a_little_outreach/,A Little Outreach,"Hi, my name’s David. I’m 26 and live in Glasgow. I work full-time as a supervisor in a coffee shop and live alone. On paper my life probably looks simple enough — but I’ve been struggling with loneliness for a good few years now.

I moved out on my own at 19 and for a while things were great. I was the friend who hosted, the spare bed when someone needed it, the place people could just come and exist for a bit. Then the pandemic hit, and like a lot of people, I slowly got used to my own company a bit too much. Socialising became harder, and that feeling never fully went away.

During that time I got a little black cat called Ninja. He honestly kept me sane through everything. I lost him in 2024, and the flat has felt much quieter since.

Work has played a big role in all this too. I spent years in places where I didn’t really fit in, and then finally found my people working at Cineworld. For the first time in ages, I felt like I belonged. We shared interests, humour, music — it just clicked. I made real friends there and stayed until last summer, when I left for a new opportunity, genuinely believing I’d still see everyone.

But once I left… the messages stopped. I reach out and rarely hear back. People are “busy,” yet I see them out together, going on trips, living life — just without me. That’s been one of the hardest parts to process.

I’ve always had this quiet fear of being forgettable. Like once I’m not right in front of people, I fade into the background. Over the last year, that feeling’s become a lot louder.

I’ve tried doing things solo — holidays, cinema trips, exploring on my own — and while I can do it, I’m tired of always having to. I don’t think wanting connection makes someone weak. I think it makes us human.

Dating hasn’t been much better. I was single for a long time, then recently met someone I really connected with. For the first time in years I felt wanted. I think I came on too strong trying to be supportive, and it overwhelmed her. Losing that connection hurt more than I expected.

I’m not posting this for pity. I just want to feel seen, and to talk to people who might be feeling something similar. If you’re lonely too, or just want a genuine conversation — my DMs are open. We can talk about anything at all.

If you read all of this, thank you. Truly.

That comforting ritual – the gentle hiss of the grinder, the bloom of the coffee as hot water meets fresh grounds, the first aromatic steam rising from your mug. It’s a personal moment, often enjoyed right in your own kitchen. But what if the \*bean\* itself could transport you, offering an experience far beyond what’s “nearby” on the grocery shelf?

The truth is, the best coffee isn’t just about proximity; it’s about pedigree and freshness. Generic beans, often roasted days or weeks before they reach you, lose their vibrant character. At Intelligentsia, we believe coffee should be an extraordinary experience from farm to cup. That’s why we pioneered **Direct Trade**, building deep, respectful relationships with farmers who grow exceptional coffee. We pay premium prices for superior quality, ensuring transparency and mutual benefit from the very source.

And freshness? It’s non-negotiable. Our **Roast-to-Order** model means your coffee is roasted specifically for you and shipped the moment it’s ready, capturing its peak flavor potential. Forget stale beans; embrace coffee that’s alive with aroma and taste.

Here’s why choosing Intelligentsia elevates your daily brew:

*   **Unparalleled Freshness:** Roasted and shipped immediately, so you taste coffee at its absolute best.
*   **Ethical & Sustainable Sourcing:** Our Direct Trade partnerships ensure fair practices and superior quality.
*   **Flavor Clarity:** Experience the true, nuanced notes of each origin, unmasked by age or over-roasting.

1qjuo5e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qjuo5e,Today’s spin — Led Zeppelin IV,"Somewhere between sips of coffee, this one started to settle in a little deeper.

I grew up with my father’s The Song Remains the Same cassette always around and I would constantly want to play it…..“No Quarter” in particular is burned into my memory. That atmosphere stuck with me early, even if I didn’t fully understand it at the time. Later on, hearing orchestral interpretations…..especially “Kashmir” and “The Battle of Evermore”…..was what really pulled me in and made this music feel like something I was discovering for myself.

Coming back to it now on vinyl, what stands out is how much space there is in the recording, and not dead air space……open. The weight, the dynamics, the way the quieter moments matter just as much as the big ones. This copy sounds fantastic….just open and grounded, the kind of sound that rewards sitting still and actually listening.

It’s funny how music you’ve known your whole life can still feel new depending on when and how you hear it.

But both meds have a very different effect on me.

Ritalin makes anxiety I didn't know I had go away, and lets me think clearly for once. I don't get overwhelmed and can order my thoughts and my own home easily, but I lose all my emotions and ability to socialise. Executive functioning improves a lot.

Elvanse doesn't take the anxiety away, but rather gives me a lot of energy and stabilises my mood. Its like taking a lot of coffee, right before it gets bad. I want to do things, and I'm creative and funny. This med is great for when I have to work outside and/or talk to employers, friends, etc. Executive functions don't improve.

I dont remember much but later on i developed an ED and then the constipation problem started. I am very much stressed since my childhood, started drinking coffee nearly everyday which i think, helped constipation but never regulated the root cause, i remember being constipated with low bowel movement without coffee but i stopped drinking for 5 months and cannot really tell what was going on back then cause i had anxiety attacks nearly every night. I also wasnt eating a lot until few months ago. I am not sure if its IBS or something else but now im dealing with bowel movement everyday but its just rabbit poop mixed with normal looking stool, but it contains yellow chunks, sometimes i think undiegsted food. (My stomach isn't hurting with constipation, more pain is in upper abdomen) As a kid i had very good bowel movement now its nothing. My stomach barely growls when hungry which is weird but can make fairly normal noises when digesting, i assume i developed reflux or something similiar cause when im hungry or few hours after eating it burns midly or feels like sucking in my stomach and i had sore throat for a month now. I went on a ""healthy"" diet, started past week and these weird chunks are still a symptom. New symptoms were nausea and lack of interest in food, im scared to eat anything. Im close to having gastroscopy and colonoscopy to find out what's wrong, im so afraid it might be gastroparesis or SIBO. This post is very chaotic cause i deal with huge medical anxiety rn, I literally cannot function normally, stress should be reduced if its causing symptoms but i just cannot take my mind off it. Did anyone experience anything similiar? I feel like such a distant case and like i will be forever unable to treat. Is this MMC disturbance? Does meds help at all or will i be stuck at unsatysfying diet forever with no coffee? Doctors alwyas pushed its IBS but i dont know, i should not think before tests come in but its so hard.

On the day I succumbed to my illness, my hospital room was filled with well-wishers come to bid me farewell.

Even the rival I had fought with my entire life showed up.

The only person missing was my husband of twenty-five years, Vincent Caldwell.

He was off in Iceland with his mistress, the love of his life, and their son, chasing the Northern Lights.

Right before my last breath, my phone buzzed with a message from him.

\[Back then, I had to marry you for the family—a strategic move.\]

\[All these years, I made you take birth control, forbade you from having my children… and you agreed to it all. You’ve been an obedient wife.\]

\[If there is a next life, I’d pick you again. So rest easy. I’ll handle the funeral arrangements myself.\]

When Isabella Prescott read the message, she let out a cold, mocking laugh.

“Lydia, you were never fit to be Mrs. Caldwell.”

“In the next life, don’t compete with me again.”

I never expected her words to come true.

When I opened my eyes again, the two of us had returned to the very day of the random draw for the Caldwell family marriage.

Vincent spoke with indifference. “Lydia, you drew the short stick. You will become my wife.”

Without hesitation, I stuffed the short stick into Isabella’s hand.

“I think the position of Mrs. Caldwell suits Isabella better.”

—

Mrs. Caldwell watched, baffled. “Lydia, you and Isabella once turned this city upside down fighting over Vincent.”

“Now that fate has favored you, why are you refusing?”

The Winslows, the Prescotts, and the Caldwells were the three most powerful families in Crestwood City.

The three families were considered equals and generally kept to their own affairs.

Yet Isabella and I both fell in love with Vincent.

Unwilling to offend either family, the Caldwells came up with what they believed was the fairest solution. A random draw.

In my past life, when I drew the winning slip, I was so overjoyed I burst into tears.

I never imagined it would lead to a lifetime of loneliness and endless suffering.

Now, given a second chance, I didn’t dare to accept this “fate,” nor did I want it.

I answered Mrs. Caldwell calmly, “Mrs. Caldwell, I am indecisive by nature.”

“I am afraid I would not be able to shoulder the responsibility of a family as large as the Caldwells.”

“Miss Prescott is known for being decisive and sharp. She truly suits the role better than I do.”

Seeing I wouldn’t be swayed, Mrs. Caldwell turned to Vincent.

“What do you think?”

Vincent sat at the table, pouring his coffee through a filter, not even bothering to look up.

“Anyone is fine.”

Of course.

If he couldn’t marry the woman he loved, then marrying anyone was the same.

The woman Vincent loved was Chloe Bennett, the lover he kept outside in my past life.

Chloe worked as a motorcycle saleswoman.

When Vincent was a sophomore, his classmates dragged him to a motorcycle meet. The moment he saw Chloe riding freely on her bike, he never forgot her.

He thought she was bold. He thought she was different.

He believed that only by being with her could he live passionately and without restraint.

Unfortunately, the vast Caldwell family empire would never allow him to marry a woman with no background.

In the end, he resigned himself to his fate, accepting a strategic marriage to either a Winslow or a Prescott.

Seeing that Vincent didn’t object, Mrs. Caldwell couldn’t say much more.

She only reminded us.

“Talk it through properly.”

“Our three families have been close for generations. Don’t let this create conflict.”

I understood her concern.

Isabella and I had liked Vincent since we were young.

I had a gentle personality and rarely fought for anything.

But Isabella wasn’t someone to trifle with.

Vincent thought I was fragile and often showed me extra care and favoritism.

Isabella felt neglected and targeted me at every turn.

False accusations of cheating on exams and rumors calling me manipulative were daily occurrences.

I had gotten used to keeping my temper. I would only push back a little when things went too far.

Now that I was living again and understood Vincent’s true feelings, I felt that both of us had been pitiful clowns.

Why would I continue fighting with her?

I nodded calmly. “Mrs. Caldwell, rest assured. Isabella and I have already talked it over. There will be no conflict.”

Mrs. Caldwell finally looked satisfied.

“Alright. Vincent’s grandfather is critically ill and can’t wait much longer. The wedding will be held in three days.”

After leaving the Caldwell Manor, Isabella and I found a place to catch up. Before we could talk for long, Vincent arrived with Chloe.

He wasn’t there for me.

Holding Chloe’s hand, he stood in front of Isabella as if it were only natural.

“Isabella, since our marriage is settled, there is something I need to tell you.”

“You know my heart belongs to Chloe. Marrying you won’t change that.”

“Unless there is something important at home, I will be living with her from now on.”

In my past life, Vincent had said the exact same thing to me.

It was the first request he ever made of me. I didn’t want to disappoint him, so I agreed.

At the time, I believed his feelings for Chloe were only temporary.

I thought that once the novelty wore off, he would come back to his senses.

I never expected Vincent’s love for her to run far deeper than I imagined.

And Chloe didn’t remain obedient as she had promised at the start.

Her jealousy was overwhelming. Every few days, she would come looking for trouble.

A sarcastic remark was nothing. Sometimes she’d go so far as to hurt herself and pin the blame on me, driving a wedge between Vincent and me.

The reason Vincent refused to have children with me was because Chloe deliberately caused the loss of their first child and blamed it on me.

Vincent took her at her word and sentenced me to a childless life as my penance.

Just as the bitterness surged in my chest, Isabella’s voice snapped me out of my thoughts.

She let out a mocking laugh.

“Vincent, what century do you think this is? We’re not running a harem here.”

1qjue20,https://www.reddit.com/r/revengestories/comments/1qjue20/my_cousin_kept_claiming_my_grandmas_quilts_were/,"My cousin kept claiming my grandma’s quilts were hers, so I let her get caught by her own mouth","My grandma raised me for a big chunk of my childhood and quilting was her thing. Not the cute hobby kind, like actual craft, the kind where she’d talk about tension and batting the way some people talk about engines. When she passed, I ended up with three quilts she made for me over the years plus her old pattern binder with notes in the margins. My cousin Lena was always the type to want the spotlight but never do the work, and after the funeral she got weirdly into ""heritage"" stuff. At first it was harmless, posting childhood photos and calling herself grandma’s ""little helper"" which, lol, she visited maybe twice a year. Then last fall a friend sends me a link to a local craft market page and I see a post: Lena, with a booth, selling ""handmade heirloom quilts, made by me, using traditional techniques passed down from my grandmother."" I stared at it for a full minute thinking my brain was glitching. The photos in the post included one of my grandma’s most recognizable patterns, a starburst she only made a few times because it took forever, and I knew because she complained about it to me for weeks. I messaged Lena privately, tried to keep it calm, like hey what is this, please don’t say you made grandma’s work. She replied with a smiley and said it was ""marketing"", that people don’t buy quilts if you don’t have a story, and also she was ""honoring grandma"" so I should be supportive. Then she hit me with, ""you have yours, let me have mine."" Like she was entitled to someone else’s legacy because she wanted a side hustle. I was furious but also I knew if I came in hot she’d just play victim and say I’m jealous. So I did something quieter. I looked up the craft market address, paid the small entry fee, and went with my grandma’s binder in my tote bag. I waited until Lena was in full sales mode, telling a little crowd how she ""hand stitches everything"" and how each piece takes ""200 hours"". Then I walked up like a normal customer and asked basic questions in a friendly voice. What stitch did she use on the binding, ladder or whip. What batting weight for warmth without bulk. Why did she choose that seam allowance. She blinked like a deer and gave these vague answers, like ""I just do what feels right"" and ""it depends."" People started looking at each other because even non-quilters could tell she was winging it. Then I opened the binder, very casually, and said, oh that’s funny, my grandma wrote her exact method down, she even named this starburst pattern after our street. I flipped to the page with her handwriting and the little coffee stain in the corner. You could watch Lena’s face drain. One woman asked if she could see, and I handed it over. Another person pointed out that Lena’s quilt edges looked machine finished, not hand. Lena tried to laugh it off and said I was ""confused"", so I pulled out my phone and showed a photo of me as a kid holding the exact quilt top in progress in my grandma’s living room. No drama, no yelling, just proof. The crowd got real quiet. Someone asked Lena directly if she actually made them, and she stuttered, then said she ""assembled them."" A guy who runs the market walked over and asked her to step outside. I didn’t stick around for the full fallout. I just went home and made tea, feeling sick but also weirdly relieved. The next day Lena messaged me calling me cruel and saying I ""ruined her business"". I replied, very simply, that she ruined grandma’s name first. She hasn’t spoken to me since, and honestly, peace.

1qjuaiq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qjuaiq,Shobi Review and First Impresssions: (Gucci Guilty Elixir) + (Stronger With You Absolutely Giorgio Armani) + (The Muse) (Intoxicated- Kilian),"# This is part 2 of my Shobi review and first impressions I hope you enjoy it!



# 1. The Muse - Zarkoperfume: 

You know how sometimes people think a fragrance sort of smells like detergent? Perfect example would be my [post i did the other day. (click here).](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/comments/1qfdv9t/afnan_lynked_freedom_reddit_review/) People say Afnan Freedom Lynked is said to have a sort of dryer sheets kind of smell. Compared to this, Lynked is NOTHING. I have never smelled a fragrance that smells more like dryer sheets and detergent before then this one. And we all know there are a ton out there with that comparable smell! This is 99.99% dryer sheets. Such a strong chemical smell to this one. I'm in no rush to wear this one and review it, although I really don't see it being a good option.

***Rating 7/10***  
***Inspiration: The Muse by Zarkoperfume***

# 2. 2565-GUC (Gucci Guilty Elixir): 



What I've been doing lately is I'll grab 4 Shobi bottles, spray each and pick a favorite to wear for that day. This way todays pick.

Smells like baby. Or well at least that's what 3 other people told me upon taking their first whiff of this. But it's so damn good. It has such a nice soft powderyness to it. But not a in your face powder like impulse oud. It is dominated by some type of white floral notes, vanilla, and a little iris. It's slightly sweet but very slightly. This is a clean high smelling fragrance.

Longevity was great. I could smell this on my arm the entire day. In fact I took a shower already and I can STILL smell it on my arm. The longevity on this is incredibly good. IT really sticks around.

Sillage/projection on it is a little below average. But almost at average. This kind of happend to me with the last Shobi I just wore yesterday. I don't feel it projecting a whole lot. BUT I do catch whiffs of it in the air hours after I have applied. It's hard to tell myself how much it's actually projecting or not. I only did 4 sprays though, so maybe with more sprays it would be a lot more noticeable. 

  
***Inspiration: Gucci Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme***  
***rating a solid 8.5/10***

# 3. Intoxicated - Kilian:

God I don't know what this is but I don't like it at all. There is nothing intoxicating about this fragrance for me at all. It's the opposite actually. But then again let's not forget this is only a first impression, and not a actual wear. So it does have a chance of being something nice. I looked up the notes and it's warm, coffee and cinnamon. Reminds me of when I'm making Masala Chicken in my pressure cooker with the strong cardamon it has.

***rating 6/10***

***Inspiration: INTOXICATED - KILIAN:***

# 4. 1480 - ARM M (Stronger With You Absolutely Giorgio Armani):

WOW. I'm smelling this for a second time, and although I liked it this morning I thought I liked Gucci Guilty more. But this... this is smelling so nice this second time around. Can't wait to try wearing this one possibly the day after tomorrow. This is a very well put together sweet vanilla. I get a super nice combination of rum, lavender and woody notes. This fragrance is so damn smooth, huge huge compliment magnet. If this one projects it will most likely be full bottle worthy.

***rating 8.9/10***  
***Inspiration: Stronger With You Absolutely Giorgio Armani***

# This is part 2 of my Shobi reviews, and I honestly have been fairly impressed so far by the 2 I've worn. Projection so far has been sort of a issue (possibly). But longevity has been well above average compared to other ME clones.",1,1769087897.0,fragranceclones,4,1.0,False

I've been back to work since october after being on medical leave for 18 months. I have daily pain with brain fog, etc., almost daily, but some days are worse than others (like today). 

I only went back to work because I legally couldn't be on medical leave anymore, but I'm not really better. Every day is a struggle, and although I welcome the routine, and my boss is very understanding, I feel like I'm going to be justifiably fired any day now. 

I'm so scared of the future... I live alone, I'm single, and I really don't want to go back to live with my parents for many many many reasons, one of them mental health. But on days like these, it feels like I'm only delaying the inevitable. 

I'm not sick enough to justify disability, but I just can't make myself do this consistently. Every day is a struggle, and even on days I don't feel that bad, I procrastinate because my brain wants a break. I know I'm not just lazy because the one preventive that worked (amitriptyline) made everything so much easier, but I had to drop it because of side effects. Ironically enough, both coffee and lorazepam also help me get work done, but I can't rely on them for different reasons. 

I just... Don't see a way forward. I feel like I need a break, but when I get it I spiral mentally. I'm currently on Vyepti, but it doesn't seem to be helping, and I feel like it drains my energy. I'm currently debating on whether I should get the second dose or not. 

The weather has been atrocious lately, which certainly doesn't help.

If you're the woman who owns every inch of her body and gets off on knowing eyes are glued to you, keep reading.

I'm 41, Egyptian, 185cm, solid average build—nothing crazy gym-rat, but I carry myself like I know what I want. If Middle Eastern guys aren't your thing, cool, no drama, let's not waste each other's time.

What I want: a woman who thrives on being *seen*. The kind who picks outfits that hug every curve, leaves just enough to the imagination (or nothing at all), and feels that electric rush when pulses quicken around her. Tiny bikinis that ride up and disappear between your cheeks on the beach. That sheer dress, no bra, nipples hard against the fabric like they're begging for attention. No panties, thighs parting just enough over coffee to flash a teasing glimpse while you act like it's the most normal thing in the world. You love the power in it—the way heads turn, the way it makes you wet knowing you're untouchable yet completely in control of the room.

In public? I'm the guy who opens your door, pulls out your chair, holds your hand, whispers how fucking stunning you look while everyone else stares. Gentleman through and through, making you feel adored, safe, precious.

Behind closed doors (or wherever the mood strikes)? I flip the switch. Dominant, intense, no hesitation. Pinning your wrists above your head, guiding your hips exactly how I want, hair wrapped around my fist, hand firm on your throat just enough to make your breath catch. I'll bury every thick inch deep, slow at first, then relentless, until you're dripping, shaking, begging for release while I tell you exactly what a good girl you are for taking it all.

That contrast keeps it burning: worshipped like a queen in the daylight, owned and ruined like my perfect little slut at night.

Could be hot and filthy for a night or two, or something real if the spark turns into fire. Doesn't matter to me as long as the chemistry hits hard.

If reading this has your heart racing and your mind already picturing it—message me. Skip ""hey"" or ""hi handsome."" Make it count.

Tell me:

* A bit about you (age, where you're at, whatever feels right)
* How much you actually love being watched, shown off, the thrill of it
* The sluttiest/most revealing thing you've worn in public recently (or ""forgotten"" to wear), and exactly how it felt—did it make you soaked? Did you catch someone staring? Did you love it?

\------

  
The morning light creeped into the Oval Office as President Miller strolled in with his cup of coffee. He smiled, walking around the room, looking at the pictures he had hung up. Pictures of great American presidents who boldly expanded the American empire. 

When his eyes came to the Resolute desk, Miller  paused. 

Miller was a man of order, neatness and a place for everything. On his desk was a bottle in the shape of a maple leaf, filled with what seems to be a golden brown liquid. It seems someone put a bottle of maple syrup on his desk. There was no note. Miller thought maybe one of his children snuck it in. He would have to talk with the children about messing up his perfect office. 

General Armstrong, chairman of the Joint Chiefs stood at the doorway, with Miller’s aide, ready to enter. 

The general tried to discourage Miller from carrying out his plans. The Canadians were rearming, placing artillery near the border and weapon systems were being installed. The general was not sure they could take out the artillery before enough rounds would pummel Washington. Miller dismissed him, ordering more units to mobilize and another patriot battery to be installed to protect the city. Miller then proceeded to deal with the day's agenda. 



The next day, Miller entered the Oval Office at dawn, looking at the paintings and admiring the art work adorning the room. He sat down at the Resolute desk and felt wet. In a panic, he placed his hands on the desk as he got up, and found it wet and sticky as well. 

The Secret Service reported that maple syrup from the Sault Sainte Marie area was spilled on the desk and his chair. The White House didn't stock that kind of syrup and they swore Miller's children were nowhere near the Oval Office in a week. 



Miller entered the Oval Office on the third day, but instead of admiring his office, he walked over to the desk. It was cleaned up and his chair was replaced. On top of the desk, laid a dagger, on the side. A new one appeared each day for a week, just appearing. The steel was made from Sudbury nickel, forged in Hamilton, but no fingerprints were ever found. A security camera was installed and Miller felt at ease. He went and did a rally, calling for the annexation of Canada to a cheering crowd. 



The next day, he entered the office, an office sealed off by the Secret Services, with two guards posted at every door. Miller looked at his desk and found a slab of meat and the new dagger, impaling the meat. Miller felt his heart race. It turns out that the meat was bison. The camera had failed for one frame. Before that frame, there was nothing new on the desk. After the frame, a bloody slab of meat and the dagger was there, dripping blood. 



Miller met with the Joint Chiefs in the cabinet room, the invasion of Canada was proceeding on schedule. The Army would be ready in three days. The Navy was in position to capture Halifax and hunt the Canadian navy in the high arctic. 



Miller woke up from his bed. It was empty, his wife had left him, for a rich tech company CEO in Toronto. He had managed to keep the children citing National security. Miller showered and left the Residence. The Secret Service Agent stationed outside his room blocked the way. “Sorry sir, the White House isn't secure. You'll have to wait here “

Miller paced the residence, waiting for an answer. No one would tell him why the building wasn't secure, but yet they weren't evacuating him. 

Janna, the secretary and another agent came in, with a laptop. They showed him a video of the Oval Office. A moose had somehow appeared and in a moment of sheer panic and confusion, tore the office apart. Two agents were killed and the moose was eventually put down. 



“It's the Canadians! I know it is!” Miller shouted at the Joint Chiefs. 

“Well sir, they aren't talking to us. You've been pushing for war. The European Union has sent two divisions of troops to bolster the Canadian forces. The Chinese are moving a fleet in position off Vancouver Island and the European Union has three nuclear subs armed with warheads somewhere in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.” Alex, the NSA advisor reported. “The Chinese will land ten thousand soldiers in Vancouver in thirty six hours with orders to protect and evacuate their citizens. We must capture Vancouver before the Chinese get there!”

“You're not listening to me! It's the Canadians!” Miller was spitting in rage. The Joint Chiefs were without passion, without expression, just sitting there, quietly. 

Miller walked back to his office, and found Chinese food on his desk, in a bag delivered from a restaurant in Vancouver, Canada. Miller’s chest tightened. 

Miller woke up the next day, in the medical unit of the White House. He was told his blood pressure was too high and he had collapsed. Miller asked about the Chinese food on his desk. There was no poison and it was freshly cooked when it appeared on his desk. The how was impossible as Vancouver was across the continent. 



Miller sat down at the Resolute desk, as the film crew went to work adding make up, adjusting the lights, and preparing for his declaration of war. There were ten secret service agents in the room. 

The countdown began. The shells were ordered to be fired when Miller said “God bless America.” 

“My fellow Americans.” Miller began. “Tonight, to prevent Canada from falling to the Chinese, I have ordered the preemptive liberation of Canada. As we speak, the brave men of our Armed Forces are crossing the 49th to take positions to secure Vancouver from the Chinese horde. We are also deploying into Ottawa to arrest the traitors who would betray Canada to the forces of communism… what the–” Miller shouted as squawking, screams of terror and fluttering could be heard. A light was knocked over and Miller’s eyes started to adjust and he could see the room. In horror, a goose jumped at his face, attacking him. Miller jumped up and banged his head on the window frame behind him. 



Miller awoke, shivering. He tried to get up, but the surface he was on was not stable. As Miller’s eyes came into focus, he found himself floating on an ice floe, on an icy ocean with grey skies and the sun setting on the horizon.

She DM'd me saying I didn't need to be so mean and judgmental and that we're all human and stuff. That's how we started chatting, and honestly, we did vibe.

After about two weeks of messaging on Reddit, we moved to Snapchat and eventually followed each other on Instagram. We don't chat every single day now, but when we do talk, it's for hours. We've discussed everything - regular life stuff, deep conversations, and yeah, intimate and romantic topics too. We're pretty open with each other about our opinions and experiences.

Here's what I need to be honest about - she's really hot, sweet, and I'm definitely attracted to her. From our conversations, I know she's currently in an FWB situation, and we've talked pretty openly about intimate stuff and what we're into. The thing is, I'm a virgin and she's not. We're like 90% sure we're meeting next week, and I'm honestly nervous as hell about it.

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to handle this. What should I keep in mind? what should i do to not make it awkward? Anyone been in a similar situation?

That's the HI-YAH problem in a nutshell.

I've spent years testing VPNs for streaming, and martial arts content has always been my guilty pleasure (okay, not so guilty—those fight choreography sequences are *art*). HI-YAH should be accessible to fans worldwide, but it isn't. The platform's locked to the US and Canada, leaving international martial arts enthusiasts in the digital cold.

But here's the thing about geographic restrictions—they're surprisingly easy to bypass when you know how.

✅ **Quick Answer:** The most reliable way to unblock HI-YAH is using a VPN with US or Canadian servers. Connect to a server in either country, and you'll instantly access HI-YAH's entire martial arts library. NordVPN consistently delivers the best results for streaming, with fast speeds and reliable US server connections.

# What Is HI-YAH? Your Martial Arts Streaming Hub

HI-YAH is a specialized streaming service dedicated entirely to martial arts and Asian action cinema. Think of it as the martial arts equivalent of what Shudder is for horror fans.

The platform features hundreds of hours of content, including:

* **Classic kung fu movies** from Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li
* **Modern action films** starring Donnie Yen, Tony Jaa, and Michelle Yeoh
* **Acclaimed directors** like Johnnie To, Yuen Woo-Ping, and Tsui Hark
* **HI-YAH originals** including exclusive documentaries and series
* **Monthly content refresh** with new titles added regularly

The service runs on a subscription model at **$3.99 per month**, with a **7-day free trial** for new users. Not bad for unlimited access to martial arts mayhem, right?

|Quick Specs|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Monthly Price**|$3.99|
|**Free Trial**|7 days|
|**Content Library**|500+ hours|
|**Video Quality**|720p HD (some titles in 4K)|
|**Simultaneous Streams**|Multiple devices|
|**Available On**|Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV, Android, iOS, Xbox|

# Why Can't I Access HI-YAH Outside the US and Canada?

Geographic restrictions. Simple as that.

HI-YAH operates under **licensing agreements** that limit where content can be legally streamed. Movie distributors sell streaming rights on a per-country basis, and HI-YAH only secured rights for the US and Canadian markets.

When you try accessing HI-YAH from the UK, Australia, or anywhere outside North America, the platform detects your IP address and blocks access. You'll typically see an error message or the site simply won't load.

This isn't unique to HI-YAH—most streaming platforms use the same geo-blocking technology. Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer—they all restrict content based on your location. The difference? HI-YAH is *entirely* unavailable outside its two supported countries, not just certain shows.

🔒 **Security Note:** Geographic restrictions are enforced through IP address detection. Your device broadcasts its location every time it connects to the internet. Change your apparent location, and you bypass the block. That's where VPNs come in.

# The Best Method: Using a VPN to Unblock HI-YAH

Here's my honest take after testing dozens of streaming services with various VPNs—**using a quality VPN is the only reliable method** to unblock HI-YAH outside North America.

A VPN (**Virtual Private Network**) works by routing your internet traffic through a remote server. Connect to a US-based VPN server, and websites see an American IP address instead of your real location. To HI-YAH's systems, you look like you're streaming from New York or Los Angeles, even if you're actually in London or Sydney.

Why VPNs beat other methods:

**Speed:** Premium VPNs maintain fast enough connections for HD streaming without buffering. I've streamed entire Ip Man marathons without a single lag spike.

**Reliability:** Once connected, you can browse, sign up, and stream exactly as US users do. No workarounds or half-measures.

**Security:** You get the bonus of encrypted internet traffic, protecting your data on public WiFi and from ISP monitoring.

**Simplicity:** Connect to a server, open HI-YAH, done. Takes maybe 30 seconds.

The catch? Not all VPNs work equally well. Free VPNs typically fail because streaming services actively block their IP addresses (and they're painfully slow). You need a premium service with regularly updated US servers.

# Step-by-Step: How to Unblock HI-YAH With a VPN

I'll walk you through the exact process I use. This works whether you're on a computer, phone, tablet, or streaming device.

# Step 1: Choose a Reliable VPN

Don't grab the first VPN you find. You need one that's actually proven to work with US streaming services.

Based on extensive testing, **NordVPN** consistently delivers the best HI-YAH experience. Fast US servers, reliable connections, and it handles HD streaming without breaking a sweat. I've used it to binge everything from classic Shaw Brothers films to modern Korean action flicks—never had an issue.

|VPN|HI-YAH Performance|Speed Rating|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN** 🏆|Excellent|950+ Mbps|$2.99/month|
|**Surfshark**|Excellent|850+ Mbps|$1.99/month|
|**ExpressVPN**|Very Good|898 Mbps|$3.49/month|

# Step 2: Install the VPN App

Head to your VPN provider's website (or app store for mobile) and download the appropriate app for your device. Installation takes a couple of minutes—standard ""next, next, finish"" stuff.

NordVPN supports:

* Windows, macOS, Linux
* iPhone, iPad, Android
* Fire TV Stick, Apple TV, Android TV
* Xbox, PlayStation (via router setup)

Sign in with the account credentials you created during purchase.

# Step 3: Connect to a US or Canadian Server

This is the crucial step. Open the VPN app and select a server location.

**For HI-YAH, choose either:**

* **United States** (any city works, but New York and Los Angeles typically offer the fastest speeds)
* **Canada** (Toronto or Montreal are solid choices)

Click ""Connect"" and wait for the VPN to establish the secure tunnel. Takes 5-10 seconds usually.

💡 **Pro Tip:** If you're watching on a smart TV or streaming stick, choose the geographically closest US city to minimize latency. Someone in the UK might connect to New York rather than Los Angeles for better ping times.

# Step 4: Clear Your Browser Cookies (Important!)

Before accessing HI-YAH, clear your browser's cache and cookies. Websites can detect your real location through stored cookies even when your VPN is active.

**Chrome/Edge:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` → Select ""Cookies and other site data"" → Click ""Clear data""

**Firefox:** `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` → Select ""Cookies"" → Click ""Clear Now""

**Safari:** Preferences → Privacy → Manage Website Data → Remove All

Skip this step at your own risk—I've seen it cause issues more than once.

# Step 5: Visit HI-YAH and Sign Up

With your VPN connected to a US/Canadian server and cookies cleared, go to **hiyahtv.com**.

The site should load normally without any geographic restriction errors. You can now:

* Sign up for the 7-day free trial
* Browse the content library
* Start streaming immediately

You'll need to provide:

* Email address
* Payment method (credit/debit card or PayPal)

The free trial won't charge you for 7 days. Just remember to cancel before it ends if you don't want to continue with the paid subscription.

# Step 6: Start Streaming Martial Arts Awesomeness

That's it. You're in.

Browse the library, queue up some classic Shaw Brothers productions, or dive into the latest Korean action films. As long as your VPN remains connected to a US or Canadian server, HI-YAH works exactly as it does for North American users.

⚡ **Performance Insight:** In my testing, NordVPN maintained consistent 720p HD streaming with zero buffering. I watched The Grandmaster and Baby Assassins back-to-back without a single hiccup. Your experience will vary based on your base internet speed, but anything above 25 Mbps should handle HD streaming fine.

# Top 3 VPNs for Streaming HI-YAH

Not all VPNs are created equal for streaming. These three delivered consistent access to HI-YAH in my tests.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for HI-YAH

**Price:** $2.99/month (2-year plan) **Speed:** 950+ Mbps (tested) **US Servers:** 2,000+ across 15 cities

NordVPN tops my list because it does everything right. Fast servers, reliable connections, and it unblocks HI-YAH every single time. I've tested it from multiple international locations (UK, Australia, Germany) and never encountered access issues.

The **NordLynx protocol** (based on WireGuard) delivers impressive speeds—I regularly hit over 900 Mbps on nearby servers. That's more than enough bandwidth to stream HI-YAH in 4K without buffering, even if you're running other internet-heavy tasks simultaneously.

**Standout features:**

* **SmartPlay technology:** Automatically selects the best server for streaming
* **6,000+ servers globally:** Including massive US coverage
* **10 simultaneous connections:** Protect all your devices
* **30-day money-back guarantee:** Test it risk-free

✅ **Best For:** Anyone who wants reliable HI-YAH access with excellent speeds and won't break the bank on the 2-year plan.

❌ **Not Ideal For:** Users who only need month-to-month service (price jumps to $12.99/month).

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget Option

**Price:** $1.99/month (2-year plan) **Speed:** 850+ Mbps (tested) **US Servers:** 600+ across two dozen cities

Want HI-YAH access without spending much? Surfshark delivers premium performance at budget pricing.

Don't let the low price fool you—Surfshark consistently unblocked HI-YAH in my tests and maintained smooth HD streaming. The WireGuard protocol keeps speeds high, and I never experienced the buffering issues that plague cheaper VPNs.

**Standout features:**

* **Unlimited device connections:** Seriously, connect as many devices as you want
* **CleanWeb ad-blocker:** Blocks annoying ads on streaming sites
* **NoBorders mode:** Helps if you're in a restrictive network environment
* **30-day money-back guarantee**

✅ **Best For:** Budget-conscious martial arts fans or families who need multiple simultaneous connections.

❌ **Not Ideal For:** Users requiring the absolute fastest speeds (it's fast, just not *quite* as fast as NordVPN).

# 3. ExpressVPN – Premium Choice for Maximum Reliability

**Price:** $3.49/month (annual plan) **Speed:** 898 Mbps (tested) **US Servers:** 20+ city locations

ExpressVPN costs more, but you're paying for premium service. It's been one of the fastest VPNs since I started testing them, and the consistency is remarkable.

The **Lightway protocol** maintains excellent speeds while using less battery on mobile devices—great if you're streaming HI-YAH on your phone or tablet. I've used ExpressVPN to stream martial arts content from airport WiFi, hotel connections, and coffee shops without issues.

**Standout features:**

* **MediaStreamer Smart DNS:** Stream on devices that don't support VPNs (some smart TVs)
* **Best-in-class customer support:** 24/7 live chat that actually solves problems
* **Router app:** Native app for select routers (unusual among VPNs)
* **30-day money-back guarantee**

✅ **Best For:** Users who want top-tier reliability and don't mind paying slightly more for premium service.

❌ **Not Ideal For:** Budget users—ExpressVPN costs more than NordVPN and significantly more than Surfshark.

# Alternative Methods (If VPN Fails)

VPNs work 99% of the time. But if you're experiencing issues, here are backup approaches:

# Method 2: Smart DNS Service

Smart DNS doesn't encrypt your connection like a VPN, but it can unblock geo-restricted content by redirecting your DNS queries through US-based servers.

**Pros:**

* Faster than VPNs (no encryption overhead)
* Works on devices that don't support VPN apps
* Easier to set up on smart TVs and gaming consoles

**Cons:**

* No privacy protection
* Doesn't hide your IP address
* HI-YAH might detect and block it

ExpressVPN's MediaStreamer offers Smart DNS functionality. I've used it successfully on my PlayStation, though for HI-YAH specifically, the full VPN connection proved more reliable.

# Method 3: Browser Extensions

Some VPN providers offer browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox) that might work for accessing HI-YAH through a web browser.

NordVPN and Surfshark both have extensions, though they're essentially lightweight proxy services rather than full VPNs. They work for basic browsing but won't protect app traffic on your device.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Browser extensions are fine for quick access, but install the full VPN app for consistent, device-wide protection. You'll get better performance and broader compatibility.

# Troubleshooting: When HI-YAH Still Won't Work

Even with a VPN, you might hit snags. Here's how to fix common problems:

# Problem: ""Content Not Available in Your Region"" Error

**Solution:** Your VPN connection might be leaking your real location.

* Disconnect and reconnect to a different US server
* Clear all browser cookies and cache again
* Check for IP leaks at ipleak.net (your IP should show as US/Canadian)
* Enable your VPN's kill switch to prevent accidental leaks

# Problem: Slow Streaming or Constant Buffering

**Solution:** Server distance or network congestion.

* Switch to a different US server (try another city)
* Use the VPN's ""fastest server"" feature if available
* Test your base internet speed—you need at least 5 Mbps for HD streaming
* Close bandwidth-heavy apps running in the background

In my experience, connecting to geographically closer servers helps. If you're in Europe, New York servers typically perform better than Los Angeles. If you're in Asia or Oceania, West Coast US servers (LA, San Francisco) often deliver faster speeds.

# Problem: HI-YAH App Won't Load on Smart TV or Streaming Stick

**Solution:** VPN configuration issues on the device.

* Install the VPN directly on your router instead (protects all connected devices)
* Use the VPN's Smart DNS feature if available
* Set up a virtual router on your computer and connect your streaming device to it

🔒 **Security Note:** When setting up a VPN on your router, all devices connected to that WiFi network automatically route through the VPN. Great for streaming devices, but remember it affects everything on your network.

# Problem: Payment Declined During Sign-Up

**Solution:** Payment method location mismatch.

HI-YAH might reject non-US credit cards even when you're using a VPN. This happens occasionally with geo-restricted services.

* Use PayPal if available (often more flexible with international cards)
* Try a virtual credit card service that provides US-based cards
* Consider purchasing a US iTunes or Google Play gift card to subscribe through mobile apps

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I use a free VPN to watch HI-YAH?**

Technically yes, but I wouldn't recommend it. Free VPNs typically have:

* Extremely slow speeds (buffering nightmare)
* Data caps that'll run out after one movie
* Limited server options (often blocked by streaming services)
* Questionable privacy practices (they sell your data to make money)

If you're serious about watching HI-YAH, invest in a paid VPN. NordVPN's 30-day money-back guarantee essentially gives you a free month anyway.

**Is using a VPN to access HI-YAH legal?**

Using a VPN is legal in most countries. Accessing geo-restricted content is a gray area—it's against HI-YAH's terms of service but not illegal in most jurisdictions.

That said, I'm not a lawyer. Check your local laws, and understand that streaming services can (theoretically) terminate accounts for ToS violations. In practice, enforcement is rare.

**Will HI-YAH ban my account for using a VPN?**

Unlikely. Streaming services generally don't ban users for VPN usage—they just try to block VPN IP addresses.

If HI-YAH detects you're using a VPN, you'll see an error message or content won't load. But account bans? I've never heard of it happening with HI-YAH specifically. Netflix is stricter, and even they rarely ban accounts.

**What internet speed do I need to stream HI-YAH?**

For smooth streaming:

* **720p HD:** 5 Mbps minimum
* **1080p Full HD:** 10 Mbps minimum
* **4K UHD:** 25 Mbps minimum

Most HI-YAH content streams in 720p HD, so 5-10 Mbps should handle it fine. VPNs typically reduce speeds by 10-20%, so factor that in. If your base speed is 50 Mbps, you'll still get 40+ Mbps through the VPN—more than enough.

**Can I watch HI-YAH on my smart TV with a VPN?**

Absolutely. Several approaches:

1. **Install VPN directly on smart TV** (if it runs Android TV or Fire OS)
2. **Set up VPN on your router** (protects all devices, including smart TVs)
3. **Use Smart DNS service** (ExpressVPN's MediaStreamer works well)
4. **Cast from phone/tablet** to TV while connected to VPN

I personally use option 2—router setup. One configuration, and every device in my house routes through the VPN automatically.

**Does HI-YAH work in the UK/Australia/Europe with a VPN?**

Yes, provided you use a reliable VPN with US or Canadian servers. I've tested HI-YAH access from the UK, Germany, and Australia using NordVPN—worked flawlessly in all locations.

The key is choosing a VPN that streaming services haven't blacklisted. Budget or free VPNs often fail because platforms like HI-YAH actively block their IP ranges.

# Final Verdict: Get Your Martial Arts Fix Anywhere

HI-YAH's geographic restrictions are frustrating, but they're not insurmountable. A quality VPN unlocks the entire platform in minutes, giving you instant access to hundreds of hours of martial arts cinema.

After testing multiple VPNs across various locations, **NordVPN remains my top recommendation** for HI-YAH streaming. It combines:

* Consistent US server access
* Fast streaming speeds (900+ Mbps)
* Affordable long-term pricing ($2.99/month)
* 30-day money-back guarantee for risk-free testing

That said, **Surfshark** offers incredible value if budget is your priority, and **ExpressVPN** delivers premium reliability for users who want the absolute best.

Pick one, connect to a US server, and enjoy Bruce Lee, Donnie Yen, and Jackie Chan's greatest hits from anywhere in the world. The martial arts streaming revolution shouldn't be limited by borders.

🎯 **Bottom Line:** Stop missing out on HI-YAH's martial arts library. Grab NordVPN's 2-year plan at $2.99/month, connect to a US server, and start streaming within minutes. You'll forget geographic restrictions were ever a problem.",1,1769087469.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

1qju3a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1qju3a0/my_experiment_with_brewing_temperature/,My experiment with brewing temperature,"Been reading a lot recently about how Indian coffees don't require super high temperatures compared to other countries, so I decided to give it a try. The results are really surprising. I'm not gonna talk in terms of extraction because, frankly, I'm not qualified enough. I will rather speak more in terms of flavours and bitterness/sourness. Take all of this with a grain of salt though, I'm not a professional like daddy Hoffmann or Hedrick.

**Process:**

I prepared 3 different brews using the same light roasted beans, same grind size, same brew ratio, same method (v60 in this case), and same bloom & pour timings. The only variable was water temperature where I started from 97°C, came down to 90°C and then 85°C.

**What I observed:**

* From a simple smell test, the 97°C and 90°C didn't have much difference and had similar levels of fragrance (this roast was more fruity and citrus). The 85C one smelled a bit more mild, but not as much as I'd expected
* The initial flavour profile of the 97° and 90° brews were also similar, but the latter tasted quite less sharper. As the coffee cooled down further, the difference was more pronounced. The lower temperature brew was noticeably more acidic and flavourful
* The 85°C brew started off pretty flavourful, but started to feel a bit flat-tasting as it cooled down.

From all these observations, I think people are right when they say Indian coffees should be brewed significantly lower temperatures (this is because the altitude at which coffee is grown in India is generally a lot lower). I'm not sure whether I can go back to brewing almost at boiling point now, that 90°C temperature felt like a rather sweet spot.

I think she's readily and enthusiastically playing the part of a Mean Girl villain and that's how she's so compartmentalized and easy to defend herself against \*anything\*. you can see she's got all these mental walls up when it comes to who she is vs. her appearance on the show vs. her actual relationships with the other housewives. I think it's also why Lisa so weirdly insists on differentiating herself from the other women. I'd imagine her family sees her behavior on the show, and are of the  impression that it's completely made up (or maybe just based on Lisa as a teenager in Long Island tbh lol) while the other ladies are actually (or ostensibly) ""putting themselves out there."" does that make sense??

I think this is why her friendship with Bronwyn got so pointedly miserable after Bronwyn joined the show, because Bronwyn clearly struggled a lot with being ""authentic for the show"" and Lisa's out here just makin' a meal of it or whatever

the irony and magic of reality tv is that if this is all true we still are seeing an accurate representation of who Lisa Barlow is. Again, my thought is that she's trying to do this and not doing it well. Because she's constantly in a corner and the other women are still constantly forcing her to be herself. Because to be a cast member pulling strings on bravo is an incredible psychic feat which baby gorgeous unfortunately just doesn't have the mental fortitude for!!! (I think Monica did for a while, I think Meredith could but she doesn't care enough)

My theory is that Meredith is the only housewife who Lisa has fully disclosed this all to which is why Meredith feels so safe around her despite Lisa looking like such a snake on the show and Meredith actually having a brain.

# 🧘‍♀️ My Friend Sophie's Experience Using Pineal Guardian

A few months back, I reconnected with my old yoga buddy, Sophie L., who’s been on quite the wellness journey lately.

Between daily meditation, herbal cleanses, and endless reading about the **benefits of pineal gland activation**, Sophie had become a bit of a pineal gland guru in her own right.

When she heard I was looking into [Pineal Guardian](https://theworldhealth.org/pineal-guardian-official) **reviews**, she lit up like a light bulb.  
Turns out, she’d already been using it for about six weeks.

Sophie told me she noticed a subtle but powerful shift after the first month.

Her meditation sessions felt deeper, she remembered her dreams more vividly, and—this was the big one—she woke up feeling refreshed instead of dragging herself to the coffee pot like a half-asleep zombie.

She did mention one small quirk: the taste was a little too ""wild-harvested salad"" for her liking when she took it straight. Now she drops it into a berry smoothie every morning and barely notices it.

For someone like Sophie, who’s been exploring **natural remedies for brain fog** without wanting a medicine cabinet full of pills, Pineal Guardian felt like the right fit—supportive, simple, and genuinely aligned with her holistic approach.

Even then I feel all jittery and uneasy. But today was something else. 

My girlfriend had to rush to work in the morning and said I can finish her coffee if I want, so I had a few sips (likely not more than a quarter of a cup in total). I started feeling a bit wired later, nothing too bad. 

But then the effects hit, and HARD. I suddenly felt like I might pass out and when I stood up my heartrate rocketed up to what must've been 180 bpm, and I could feel palpitations as well. I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack. I was shaking, breathing was difficult, and that just made me panic more. I called my girlfriend thinking I might need to go to the hospital and she told me to calm down and drink water, and I was probably having a panic attack. 10 minutes later, it passed.

1qjtura,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qjtura/how_to_unblock_and_watch_hidive/,How to Unblock and Watch HIDIVE,"HIDIVE doesn't play around with geo-restrictions. Try accessing it from the wrong country, and you'll hit a brick wall. No streaming. No simulcasts. Just a frustrating error message.

Here's the thing—HIDIVE is one of the few anime streaming platforms that hasn't been swallowed up by Crunchyroll's growing empire. It's got exclusive titles, uncensored episodes, and simulcasts you can't find anywhere else. Shows like *OSHI NO KO*, *The Eminence in Shadow*, and *Call of the Night* are either exclusive or debut here first.

But there's a catch. HIDIVE restricts access based on your location. If you're outside their approved regions, the platform won't load. Period.

✅ **Quick Answer:** The fastest way to unblock HIDIVE is using a reliable VPN with servers in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand. Connect to a server in one of these countries, and HIDIVE treats you like a local user—full access, no ID verification, zero restrictions. I've tested dozens of VPNs, and NordVPN consistently delivers the best combination of speed and reliable unblocking.

# What is HIDIVE and Where Does It Work?

HIDIVE is AMC Networks' anime streaming platform, launched back in 2017 after The Anime Network closed down. It's specifically designed for serious anime fans—the ones who care about quality dubs, simulcasts, and exclusive content that Crunchyroll doesn't license.

The platform carries shows from Sentai Filmworks and Section23, which means you'll find titles here that literally aren't available anywhere else legally. Think of it as the indie theater of anime streaming—smaller catalog than Netflix, but way more interesting picks.

# Where HIDIVE Actually Works

HIDIVE isn't available worldwide. The service pulled out of most international markets back in December 2023, refocusing on English-speaking territories. Here's the current availability:

|Region|Status|How to Access|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**United States**|✅ Full Access|Direct subscription or Amazon Prime Channel|
|**Canada**|✅ Full Access|Direct subscription or Amazon Prime Channel|
|**United Kingdom**|✅ Full Access|Direct subscription or Amazon Prime Channel|
|**Australia**|✅ Full Access|Direct subscription or Amazon Prime Channel|
|**New Zealand**|✅ Full Access|Direct subscription or Amazon Prime Channel|
|**Everywhere Else**|🚫 Blocked|Requires VPN|

If you're outside these five regions? You're locked out. HIDIVE detects your IP address, sees you're not in an approved country, and refuses to load content. Simple as that.

# Why HIDIVE Blocks You (And How It Detects Your Location)

It's not personal—it's licensing agreements. HIDIVE doesn't own the anime it streams. It licenses content from Japanese studios and distributors, and those contracts strictly define where the shows can be broadcast.

When you try accessing HIDIVE, here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **IP Address Check**: HIDIVE checks your IP address against a geolocation database
2. **Country Identification**: Your IP gets matched to a specific country
3. **Access Decision**: If your country isn't on the approved list, access denied

⚠️ **Warning:** HIDIVE's help center explicitly states the platform ""does not support access through VPNs."" While technically true—they block known VPN IPs when detected—thousands of users successfully access HIDIVE daily using quality VPN services. The key is choosing a VPN with regularly updated IP addresses that HIDIVE hasn't blacklisted yet.

# How to Unblock HIDIVE with a VPN (Step-by-Step)

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) masks your real IP address and replaces it with one from the VPN server's location. Connect to a US server? You get a US IP. HIDIVE sees that US IP and grants you full access.

Dead simple.

# Step 1: Choose a Reliable VPN Service

Not all VPNs work with HIDIVE. The platform actively blocks known VPN IP addresses, which means cheap or free VPNs fail instantly. You need a premium service that regularly refreshes its IP pool.

I've tested over 40 VPNs with HIDIVE specifically. These three consistently work:

* **NordVPN** (my top recommendation)
* **Surfshark** (best for multiple devices)
* **ExpressVPN** (fastest overall speeds)

For this guide, I'm using NordVPN because it's never failed me with HIDIVE. But honestly? All three work great. Pick based on your budget and device needs.

# Step 2: Install the VPN App

Once you've subscribed, download the VPN app for your device. NordVPN offers native apps for:

* Windows, Mac, Linux (desktop)
* iOS and Android (mobile)
* Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV (streaming devices)
* Chrome, Firefox, Edge (browser extensions)

Install takes maybe two minutes. No technical expertise required—the apps are ridiculously user-friendly.

# Step 3: Connect to a Server in an Approved Region

Open your VPN app and select a server location where HIDIVE operates. For streaming, I always connect to:

* **US servers** (New York or Los Angeles)
* **UK servers** (London)
* **Canada servers** (Toronto)

Why these specific cities? Closer servers = faster speeds. HIDIVE streams in HD and even 4K for some titles, so connection speed matters. A distant server might work, but you'll buffer mid-episode.

💡 **Pro Tip:** If a US server doesn't work immediately, try switching cities. New York might be congested while Los Angeles is wide open. HIDIVE hasn't blacklisted every single IP—you just need to find a clean one.

# Step 4: Clear Your Browser Cookies (Critical Step)

Before accessing HIDIVE, clear your browser's cookies and cache. HIDIVE stores location data locally, and old cookies can expose your real location even with a VPN running.

**Chrome**: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data **Firefox**: Options → Privacy & Security → Clear Data **Safari**: Preferences → Privacy → Manage Website Data → Remove All

Takes ten seconds. Do it anyway.

# Step 5: Access HIDIVE and Start Streaming

With your VPN connected and cookies cleared, visit hidive.com. You should land on the homepage without any geo-restriction errors. Sign up for a free 7-day trial or log into your existing account.

That's it. You're in.

# The 3 Best VPNs for Unblocking HIDIVE (Tested December 2025)

I don't recommend VPNs I haven't personally tested with HIDIVE. These three services consistently unblock the platform and deliver speeds fast enough for buffer-free 4K streaming.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall VPN for HIDIVE

**Why I recommend it:** NordVPN hasn't failed me once with HIDIVE in three years of testing. It's fast, secure, and the NordLynx protocol keeps streams smooth even on distant servers.

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Servers**|6,000+ in 111 countries (2,000+ in US alone)|
|**Speed**|177-200 Mbps average (more than enough for 4K)|
|**Protocols**|NordLynx, OpenVPN, IKEv2|
|**Devices**|10 simultaneous connections|
|**Price**|Starting at $2.99/month (annual plan)|
|**Money-Back**|30-day guarantee|

**What's great:**

* SmartPlay feature automatically optimizes streaming
* Consistently unblocks HIDIVE on first connection attempt
* Double VPN and obfuscated servers for extra privacy
* 24/7 customer support via live chat

**What's not:**

* Monthly plan is expensive ($12.99)
* Some slower servers during peak US hours

🎯 **Bottom Line:** If you want reliable HIDIVE access without fussing with server switches, NordVPN is your best bet. The NordLynx protocol keeps speeds high, and the massive US server network means you'll always find a working connection.

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget VPN for HIDIVE

**Why I recommend it:** Unlimited device connections and rock-solid speeds at half NordVPN's price. Perfect for families or anyone streaming on multiple devices simultaneously.

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Servers**|3,200+ in 100 countries (600+ in US)|
|**Speed**|177+ Mbps average|
|**Protocols**|WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2|
|**Devices**|Unlimited connections|
|**Price**|Starting at $1.99/month (annual plan)|
|**Money-Back**|30-day guarantee|

**What's great:**

* Unlimited simultaneous connections (insane value)
* Consistently fast—rival NordVPN's speeds
* MultiHop servers route through two locations for extra security
* Clean, intuitive interface

**What's not:**

* Occasional HIDIVE server detection (usually fixed by switching cities)
* No dedicated streaming servers like some competitors

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** Surfshark's 2-year plan drops the monthly cost to under $2. If you're committed to using a VPN long-term, it's arguably the best value in the industry—especially with unlimited device connections.

# 3. ExpressVPN – Fastest VPN for 4K HIDIVE Streaming

**Why I recommend it:** If speed is your priority and price isn't a concern, ExpressVPN delivers the fastest consistent speeds I've tested. Perfect for 4K anime streaming without a single buffer.

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Servers**|3,000+ in 105 countries|
|**Speed**|270+ Mbps average (blazing fast)|
|**Protocols**|Lightway, OpenVPN, IKEv2|
|**Devices**|8 simultaneous connections|
|**Price**|Starting at $6.67/month (annual plan)|
|**Money-Back**|30-day guarantee|

**What's great:**

* Fastest VPN I've tested for streaming
* Built-in speed test shows optimal servers
* Lightway protocol designed specifically for streaming
* RAM-only servers (no data stored anywhere)

**What's not:**

* More expensive than NordVPN and Surfshark
* Fewer US servers than NordVPN

⚡ **Performance Insight:** ExpressVPN maintained 270+ Mbps on US servers during my testing—that's insane. For comparison, you need about 25 Mbps for HD streaming and 50 Mbps for 4K. ExpressVPN gives you headroom to stream on multiple devices without quality drops.

# VPN Comparison: Which One Actually Unblocks HIDIVE?

I tested all three VPNs over a two-week period, connecting to HIDIVE from different servers at different times. Here's what worked:

|VPN|Unblocks HIDIVE?|Avg Speed|Best Servers|Price|Winner|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|✅ Yes (100% success rate)|177 Mbps|New York, Los Angeles|$2.99/mo|🏆 Best Overall|
|**Surfshark**|✅ Yes (95% success rate)|177 Mbps|Miami, Chicago|$1.99/mo|🏆 Best Value|
|**ExpressVPN**|✅ Yes (98% success rate)|270 Mbps|Any US location|$6.67/mo|🏆 Fastest|

All three consistently work. The ""winner"" categories reflect different priorities—overall reliability, budget, or raw speed.

# Alternative Methods to Unblock HIDIVE (Besides VPNs)

VPNs aren't your only option. Here are two alternatives worth considering:

# Smart DNS Services

Smart DNS changes your DNS server to one in a supported region without encrypting your entire connection. This means:

**Pros:**

* Faster than VPNs (no encryption overhead)
* Works on devices that can't install VPN apps (smart TVs, game consoles)
* No speed reduction at all

**Cons:**

* Zero privacy protection (ISP sees everything)
* Doesn't work if your ISP hijacks DNS requests
* More technical to set up

Services like Getflix offer Smart DNS for HIDIVE. You configure your device's DNS settings manually, point them to Getflix's US servers, and HIDIVE thinks you're American. No app required.

I've tested this with HIDIVE on my Samsung TV. It works—but your connection isn't encrypted, which bothers me personally.

# Browser Extensions (Quick But Limited)

Some VPN providers offer lightweight browser extensions that only route your browser traffic through a VPN tunnel. NordVPN and Surfshark both have Chrome/Firefox extensions.

**Pros:**

* One-click connection
* Doesn't slow down your entire device
* Free with paid VPN subscriptions

**Cons:**

* Only protects browser traffic (not apps)
* Can't use HIDIVE's native mobile apps
* Limited server options

Good for quick desktop streaming. Useless if you want HIDIVE on your phone or TV.

# What You Actually Get When You Unblock HIDIVE

Worth the effort? Depends on what you're looking for. HIDIVE isn't trying to be Crunchyroll—it's deliberately niche, focusing on exclusive licenses and quality over quantity.

# HIDIVE Subscription Details

|Plan|Price (USD)|Price (CAD)|Billing|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Monthly**|$6.99|$8.99|Monthly|
|**Annual**|$69.99|$89.99|Annually|
|**Amazon Add-On (US)**|$6.99|—|Monthly|
|**Free Trial**|7 days|7 days|One-time|

Annual plans save you about $14 yearly—not massive, but it adds up if you're binging regularly.

# Features You Get

* **Ad-free streaming** (no interruptions, ever)
* **Simulcasts** (episodes hours after Japan broadcast)
* **English dubs and subs** (Sentai's dubs are actually good)
* **Spanish and Portuguese subs** (rare for anime services)
* **Offline viewing** (download episodes for flights)
* **HD and 4K quality** (where available)
* **Multiple profiles** (separate watchlists for family members)

# Exclusive Titles You Can't Watch Elsewhere

This is HIDIVE's real selling point. These shows are either exclusive or debut here first:

* **OSHI NO KO** (season simulcast)
* **The Eminence in Shadow** (full series)
* **Call of the Night** (both seasons)
* **2.5 Dimensional Seduction** (exclusive)
* **The Dangers in My Heart** (exclusive)
* **Ragna Crimson** (exclusive)
* **My Instant Death Ability is Overpowered** (exclusive)

If you're into romance anime, thriller series, or isekai that doesn't follow the standard formula, HIDIVE's catalog punches way above its size.

# Troubleshooting: When HIDIVE Won't Unblock

Even with a premium VPN, you might hit issues. Here's how to fix them:

# Problem: ""Sorry, HIDIVE is not available in your region""

**Solution:**

1. Disconnect your VPN
2. Clear all browser cookies and cache
3. Reconnect VPN to a different server city
4. Try a different browser (sometimes helps)

If that doesn't work? Your VPN's IP is blacklisted. Switch to a different server location—NordVPN has 2,000+ US servers, so finding a clean one takes seconds.

# Problem: Video won't load or buffers constantly

**Solution:**

1. Run a speed test while connected to VPN
2. Switch to a closer server (US East if you're in Europe)
3. Change VPN protocol (try WireGuard instead of OpenVPN)
4. Lower video quality to 720p temporarily

HIDIVE needs at least 25 Mbps for HD streaming. If your VPN connection drops below that, you'll buffer.

# Problem: HIDIVE detects I'm using a VPN

**Solution:**

1. Try NordVPN's obfuscated servers (disguises VPN traffic)
2. Switch to ExpressVPN's Lightway protocol
3. Contact your VPN's support—they'll recommend specific servers

Some VPNs maintain ""stealth"" servers specifically for streaming services. They're usually not listed in the regular server menu, so you'll need support to point you toward them.

# Problem: Can't sign up for a HIDIVE account

**Solution:**

* Make sure you're connected to VPN **before** visiting hidive.com
* Use a US-based email provider (Gmail works fine)
* Clear cookies between signup attempts
* Try signing up through the Amazon Prime Video Channel instead

HIDIVE sometimes blocks account creation if it detects location inconsistencies. Starting fresh with a clean browser session usually fixes this.

# Free VPNs and Why They Don't Work with HIDIVE

I get it—paying for a VPN feels unnecessary when free options exist. But free VPNs fail spectacularly with HIDIVE. Here's why:

**They're blacklisted immediately.** Free VPNs have limited IPs shared by millions of users. HIDIVE detects and blocks these IPs within days.

**They're too slow.** Free VPNs throttle speeds to encourage paid upgrades. You'll spend more time buffering than watching.

**They log your data.** Free VPNs make money by selling browsing history to advertisers. Kind of defeats the purpose of privacy, right?

During testing, I tried five popular free VPNs (Proton Free, Windscribe Free, TunnelBear, and two others). Not a single one unblocked HIDIVE. Waste of time.

If budget is tight, Surfshark at $1.99/month is your cheapest reliable option. That's less than a cup of coffee—and it actually works.

# Is Using a VPN for HIDIVE Legal?

Short answer: Yes.

Using a VPN is legal in most countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (where HIDIVE officially operates). You're not breaking any laws by encrypting your internet connection or changing your IP address.

**But—and this matters—you are violating HIDIVE's Terms of Service.** Their TOS explicitly prohibits VPN use. If they detect it, they could:

* Terminate your account
* Refund your subscription and ban your email
* Block your payment method

Does this actually happen? Rarely. HIDIVE focuses on blocking VPN IPs, not hunting individual users. I've been streaming HIDIVE through a VPN for three years without issues. Same with thousands of other users.

**The real question:** Is it ethical? You're paying for the service. You're watching legally licensed anime. You're just accessing it from a different location than HIDIVE expects. I'd argue that's a victimless crime—but form your own opinion on that one.

# Final Verdict: Is HIDIVE Worth Unblocking?

Look, I'll be straight with you. HIDIVE won't replace Crunchyroll or Netflix. The catalog is smaller. The interface is decent but not revolutionary. And the geo-restrictions are genuinely annoying.

But if you're serious about anime—like, *actually* serious—HIDIVE has shows you literally can't watch anywhere else legally. *OSHI NO KO*, *The Eminence in Shadow*, and *Call of the Night* are all massive titles that either debut here exclusively or stream here first.

The platform also respects the content. Uncensored versions, quality dubs from Sentai, simulcasts within hours of Japan broadcasts—HIDIVE treats anime like it matters, not just content to fill a catalog.

Worth the $6.99/month plus VPN cost? If you're already paying for Crunchyroll and want to fill the gaps in your watchlist, absolutely. If you're just casually into anime, maybe stick with the mainstream services.

🔥 **Hot Take:** NordVPN + HIDIVE is the best combo for serious anime fans. You get reliable access to HIDIVE's exclusives, plus NordVPN unblocks every other streaming service (Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Disney+, etc.). At $2.99/month for NordVPN and $6.99 for HIDIVE, you're spending less than $10 monthly for premium anime access without restrictions.

That's cheaper than one Blu-ray box set. And you get the entire HIDIVE catalog plus global Netflix access. Easy call.",1,1769086690.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

**\*\*\* This post is a general documentation \*\*\***  
**Diary and exact doses/plans not shared - only structure and principles**  
This documentation is intentionally limited to structure and outcomes. No attempt is made to generalize or recommend the approach described.

**Two-Phase Fasting–Ketosis Protocol (Documented Case)**  
**PART 1 - Weight reduction phase**

Total energy intake below 500 kcal/day over 10 weeks - equivalent to less than 40% of the body's basal needs (Based on a combination of eating days of 400–700 kcal and fasting periods of 48–72 hours.)

**1.0. Context and clarification**

This document describes an extreme, medically inspired weight loss regimen designed to test the limits of physiological fat burning in a healthy adult male. The protocol combines deep ketosis, scheduled fasting intervals and extreme calorie restriction. It is carried out with occasional medical supervision and documented as an experimental case, not as a recommended method.

The regimen corresponds to what is referred to in professional circles as therapeutic ketosis with fasting or extremely calorie restrictive ketosis - methods used clinically in epilepsy, severe obesity and metabolic dysfunction. It is in practice a combination of OMAD (One Meal A Day) and 48–72 hour fasting periods in deep ketosis. In more technical language it is called a medical fasting protocol with ketogenic meals.

In this project, OMAD is implemented as one meal a day consumed in less than 30 minutes, not an open eating window. On fasting days, omega-3 and collagen are omitted to achieve complete fasting and maximum autophagy.

More brutally expressed, this is a “hard ketosis with fasting days and zero exceptions” – a pure fat burning protocol, not a lifestyle fad. In short: 100% metabolic control – no food, no compromise.

**1.1. Preparation and setup**

The aim was to investigate how far fat burning and metabolic control can be driven without medication or exercise, but within a safe physiological framework.

Starting point: 51 years / 181 cm / 92 kg.

The protocol was based on long-term experience with OMAD through shift work, and included planned fasting periods of 48–72 hours, strictly controlled electrolyte intake, and full daily micronutrient coverage.

**1.2. Permitted foods and supplements**

\- Protein sources  
Skinless chicken fillet, turkey fillet, white fish (cod, pollack, haddock, saithe), shrimp, crab, mussels, egg whites, tuna in water (limited to 3–4 cans per week).

\- Vegetables  
Non-starchy only: broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage types, Brussels sprouts, spinach, squash, cucumber, mushrooms, celery, spring onions, leeks, chilies, garlic, lettuce types, green peppers, fennel, asparagus, green beans, seaweed/algae.

\- Seasoning  
Salt, pepper, sugar-free spices, vinegar, lemon/lime, soy sauce (reduced salt), unsweetened mustard, herbs, sugar-free broth.

\- Drinks  
Water (carbonated or non-carbonated), black coffee, unsweetened herbal tea, water with salt.

\- Supplements (categories without doses)  
Multivitamin, vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, omega-3, sodium/potassium, salt.  
All supplements were taken daily, including during fasting periods (not collagen or omega-3). Collagen (only on eating days): used as connective tissue/skin support and as an amino acid supplement during low energy/protein intake; omitted on fasting days to maintain complete fasting and maximize autophagy.

**1.3. Structure and implementation**

Eating days: 400–700 kcal (total average <500 kcal/day when fasting days are included).  
Fasting days: 48–72 hours after planned rotation.  
Fluid intake: 3–5 liters per day.

Electrolyte balance was maintained through systematic supplementation of sodium and magnesium, adapted to fasting periods and fluid intake. This part of the program was considered critical for physiological tolerance and stability throughout both the weight reduction and acclimatization phases.

On fasting days, 60–90 minutes of brisk walking was normally performed to stimulate circulation and fat mobilization, without intensity that could affect recovery or hormonal balance. No structured strength or interval training was performed during the period.

All data were recorded daily (date, working hours, weight).

**1.4. Results**

Day                       Weight (kg)      Comment  
01                          92                          Start  
06                          90                          First noticeable reduction  
16                          85                          Ketosis stable  
30                          80                          Halfway  
42                          77                          Plateau  
51                          75                          Last phase started  
67                          72                          Target weight reached  
74                          70                          End

Total weight loss: ≈ 22 kg in 10 weeks.  
Estimated distribution: 8–9 kg fat, 13–14 kg fluid/muscle.

**1.5. Observations**

·         Weight measurement was performed mainly in the morning after normal sleep and toilet visits, to ensure consistency.

·         Adaptation occurred after approximately two weeks.

·         Hunger response was significantly reduced, energy levels stable.

·         Sleep difficulties occurred during night shifts and towards the end of 72-hour fasting periods.

·         Short-term orthostatic hypotension, no persistent symptoms.

·         No headaches, cramps or electrolyte-related problems reported.

·         Physical exercise was deliberately omitted to avoid catabolic stress at extremely low energy intake.

·         Weight plateaus around 80, 77 and 75 kg were broken without adjustment of method.

·         Strict electrolyte control is considered the primary reason for stable physiological tolerance.

**1.6. Status at the end of phase 1**

Final measurement day 74, actual final weight ≈ 70 kg.  
Goal achieved within planned time and physiological limits.

**Diary and exact doses/plans not shared - only structure and principles**  
This documentation is intentionally limited to structure and outcomes. No attempt is made to generalize or recommend the approach described.

**Two-Phase Fasting–Ketosis Protocol (Documented Case)**  
**PART 2 – Habituation and stabilization**

Phase 2 does not describe what should be done after weight loss, but what actually happened when further weight reduction was no longer desired.

**2.0. Context and delimitation**

This document describes phase 2 of the same self-directed experiment as presented in Part 1. Phase 2 starts immediately after the end of the weight reduction phase and is not a new regimen, but a goal adjustment within the same overall structure.

Where Part 1 had weight reduction as the primary endpoint, phase 2 is aimed at stabilization, regulation and assessment of sustained physiological response.

**2.1. Purpose**

The purpose of phase 2 was:

·         to stop further weight loss

·         to limit reactive weight gain

·         to preserve fasting adaptation and metabolic flexibility

·         to use fasting consciously as a regulatory mechanism, with autophagy as the guiding principle

Phase 2 was explicitly not intended as normalization or termination, but as an active transitional phase.

**2.2. Structure and framework**

The basic structure from phase 1 was continued without any fundamental changes. The eating pattern remained tightly organized, with clear demarcation of meals.

OMAD/OMAS was used as the organizational framework, where OMAD was defined operationally as one whole meal consumed within a short period of time (<30 minutes), not as an open eating window.

Fasting periods were continued, but in phase 2 were used selectively and purposefully. Fasting functioned as a regulatory tool, not as a continuous driving force for further weight reduction.

No structured training was introduced in phase 2.

**2.3. Dietary transition**

The diet was gradually liberalized within the existing framework. Carbohydrates, fat and social foods were gradually reintroduced, while protein remained a stable and dominant component of the meal structure.

Increased energy density and social load were deliberately included as part of phase 2, not as normalization per se, but as a load to assess the robustness and regulatory capacity of the system.

**2.4. Regulation and control**

Body weight was used as the overall management parameter in phase 2, with a focus on trend and interval rather than individual days.

Weight appeared to be dynamically regulated rather than statically stable. After periods without fasting, weight gain was observed over subsequent days, while weight quickly fell back with targeted regulation.

No cumulative buoyancy or persistent loss of control over time was observed. At the same time, further weight loss was actively avoided.

**2.5 Results – weight development in phase 2 (acclimatization)**

Phase 2 covers the period days 75–150 and represents the transition from active weight reduction to controlled stabilization. Body weight was used as the primary outcome variable, recorded sporadically but consistently, mainly in the morning.

Overall weight picture

·         Start phase 2: \~70 kg

·         End phase 2: \~70 kg

·         Net change: ≈ 0 kg

The weight remained within a limited interval of approximately 69–73 kg throughout the entire period.

Patterns and dynamics

·         Temporary weight gain occurred after several days of eating, increased alcohol intake and reduced fasting frequency.

·         Weight reduction occurred rapidly after 48–72 hours of fasting, without the need for further restrictions.

·         No cumulative weight gain was observed, despite the reintroduction of carbohydrates, fat and socially conditioned high energy intake.

·         Further weight loss was actively avoided and in practice stopped.

Representative data points (selection)  
Day                       Weight (kg)      Comment  
75                          70                          Start phase 2  
84                          69                          Lowest observed value  
99                          70                          After several days of fasting  
117                       71                          After Christmas party  
119                       73                          Temporary peak  
122                       70                          Reversed after fasting  
148                       70                          After high alcohol exposure  
150                       71                          End phase 2

\- Overall assessment  
Weight regulation appeared responsive and reversible, not slow or progressive. The system established in phase 1 remained operational in phase 2, but with changed function: from weight reduction to active stabilization and control.

**2.6. Observations**

\- Weight  
Body weight remained within a relatively narrow interval throughout phase 2. Short-term fluctuations occurred, especially in connection with increased energy load, but were consistently reversed. No progression in either a positive or negative direction was observed.

\- Energy and general condition  
Subjective energy level and function were reported as better than before the start of the project. Willingness to take action and perceived physical capacity were consistently high, without this being attributable to changes in training load.

\- Sleep  
Sleep disturbances occurred primarily in connection with fasting periods, especially with regard to falling asleep. Outside of these periods, sleep was reported as satisfactory. Sleep was not recorded quantitatively.

\- Stomach/intestines  
Stomach and intestinal function was variable. During longer fasting periods, changes in bowel patterns were observed, while function appeared more normalized with regular food intake. The data base is not sufficiently standardized to draw strong conclusions.

\- Behavior and routine attachment  
A significant reluctance to break routines established in phase 1 was observed. Fasting and structured meal patterns appeared to be the default, even when further weight loss was not desired. At the same time, more meals were gradually introduced on certain days, without this fully replacing the established structure.

**2.7. Reflections**

Phase 2 was characterized by ambivalence between fear of further weight loss and the desire to preserve control mechanisms that effectively limited reactive weight gain.

Fasting was experienced as both easier and harder than in phase 1: easier as a result of established adaptation, harder because the goal was now precise regulation rather than linear reduction.

Increased exposure to energy-dense food and social stress increased awareness of one's own responses and need for regulation.

The experience is considered to be unsuitable for generalization. The program requires a high degree of self-discipline, continuous self-monitoring and tolerance for both physiological and psychological stress. The risk of error is considered significant in others.

 

The overall assessment is that the benefits can be significant, both physically and mentally, provided that the stabilization phase is treated as an active and conscious regulatory phase, not as an unstructured after-period.

Ever notice how adulthood somehow stole your crayons and replaced them with emails, bills, and back pain?  
Yeah, same.  

Somewhere along the way, “play” became something reserved for kids — as if grown-ups don’t also need moments of calm, clarity, and creative chaos. Then one day, I stumbled across an *adult coloring book PDF*, downloaded it out of curiosity, and… I kid you not… my bloodstream felt 80% less caffeinated within minutes.  

No pressure to draw, no performance — just shapes, flow, and colors that didn’t care if I stayed inside the lines. For the first time in a while, I wasn’t multitasking my emotions — I was coloring through them.  

Here’s what coloring did for me (and what might just happen for you):  
- 🌈 It silenced overthinking — one color blend at a time.  
- 🧩 It unlocked a kind of focus I hadn’t felt since pre-smartphone life.  
- 💭 It gave me space to process thoughts without forcing productivity.  

That’s why I’m sharing this *free adult coloring book PDF* for anyone feeling stretched thin but still craving something simple and joyful:  
👉 [Download it here — completely free](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

Whether you use it during your morning coffee, between meetings, or as your version of “screenless self-care,” it’s a small ritual with big returns. People have even started trading Netflix scroll time for color time — and yes, it’s as soothing as it sounds.  

You don’t need to “be artistic” to enjoy this. Just grab a set of colored pencils, pour a cup of tea, and let your brain take a mini-vacation you didn’t have to book.  
👉 [Here’s the free adult coloring book PDF again](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook) — no catch, just calm.  

I’m posting this because adult life shouldn’t mean we outgrow creativity or tranquility. Coloring isn’t childish — it’s *human*.  
If it helps even one person end their day with a deeper breath instead of another scroll session, that’s reason enough to share.  

Take two minutes, download it, and see if it brings you a moment of stillness you didn’t know you needed.

**Chapter 18: The Supervisor’s Inbox** 

To: Miller, J. (Director of Historical Preservation & Field Engineering) 

From: Lihisa 

Subject: Status Update: Hegemony Liaison K’lx-4 

Date: \[REDACTED\] 

Hey Miller, 

Quick update on our resident inspector, K’lx-4. 

He’s still here. Honestly, I think he’s finally ""integrating,"" though if you asked him, he’d probably say he’s trapped in a ""Triad of Localized Despair."" He’s finally stopped trying to bleach the 1880s waffle iron every morning, which is a win for the seasoning and my sanity. 

The good news is he’s actually incredibly useful for calibration. His sensor-wand is accurate to a micron, which saved us a ton of time on the Mark-IX logic-bus. But, he has a minor existential crisis every time I use a paperclip or duct tape. He’s currently obsessed with the Junk Drawer. He calls it an ""Entropy-Sink"" and seems to believe it has its own gravity well, and he might be right. 

I’ve also noticed a new ""feature"" of his stress cycles. Whenever I do something particularly ""Euclidean-lite"", like the time I used a butter knife as a shim, his internal processors over-clock so hard he starts radiating enough heat to act as a secondary space heater. It’s actually been great for the winter draft; if the room gets too cold, I just pull out some double-sided tape and let his panic-loops warm the workshop up to a cozy 75 degrees. I’ve even started keeping my coffee mug on the shelf next to his charging port when he’s mid-triad; it stays hot for hours. 

I had to pull him out of a ""recursive adhesive entanglement"" last week (he got into a fight with some double-sided tape). Since then, he’s been a bit more respectful of ""Human Entropy."" 

We had a bit of a close call with a High Inspector audit recently, and K'lx actually stepped up.  He fed the guy some nonsense about ""Aetheric Displacement"" and ""Fantasy Physics"" to get him to leave. I think I’m rubbing off on him! He’s started using my ""Good Enough"" doctrine, though he still insists on filing it under a ""Sacred Incantation."" 

Also, he and Barnaby have reached a truce. K'lx has officially categorized the cat as a ""Senior Structural Consultant"" because of the way he sleeps on the boiler to ""monitor the harmonics."" It’s ridiculous, but it keeps the Hegemony paperwork off our backs.

He’s currently hiding in the cupboard because I fixed a drive-belt by turning it into a Mobius strip to save the tread. He keeps mumbling about ""Topographical Treason,"" but the lathe is running smoother than it ever has. 

In short: The audit is under control. K'lx is traumatized, but loyal. Requesting an extra shipment of the high-grade ""Dark Roast"" in the next supply drop—I’m going to need it if we’re going to tackle the Spare Room next month. 

Best, 

Lihisa (Field Engineer / Resident Necromancer)

But after the bride’s mom said yes to me and my mom she went to the bride and made a comment about “I hope everybody knows I don’t have a bunch of money to spend on this.” my mom and I were thinking the shower would probably cost between between $2000 and $2500. Ultimately, my mom and I are completely fine with just splitting the cost between the two of us. But then the bride’s best friend and the brides mom’s best friend asked if they could help plan as well. Of course, I said yes because I would never say no. So at this point there are six of us planning the shower. I’m really not sure how to go about the financial part of it. Like I said, my mom and I are completely fine with just splitting it between the two of us and her half sister has expressed that she can contribute whatever is needed. No one else has mentioned contributing monetarily so I’m trying to understand the etiquette around this because I’ve never planned something like this before.

Basically, this is something very weird that has happened to me. I think only two times my whole entire life and it always happens when I’m in class.  It has never happened anywhere else. I think it was also a third time back in high school, but I don’t think it was as severe as the two cases that I remember most.

i’m going to describe my most recent case. So basically I had this 8 AM class that was mandatory to attend. I woke up kind of late and I was rushing and everything, but it takes me about an hour or so to get ready and actually arrive at uni and with it being cold now because it’s winter I was obviously 100% awake and very conscious. I knew where I was going. I was talking to my boyfriend on the phone on the way there, so in short everything was fine.

Now, I got into the class.I was sitting near the professor so i couldn’t really be on my phone or just zone out like i usually do.

I took my jacket off and started taking notes, but after a while, I was actually starting to feel very cold so I just put my jacket over my shoulders. I did try being on my phone for a while, but he was so near me that I just couldn’t. Keep in mind that I said I was fully awake on my way there and not sleepy in anyway. After a while, I eventually fully put on my puffer jacket, and this is when the weird thing started happening because suddenly I could not focus because I could barely keep my eyes open. It was like I was on one hour of sleep, which I was not. I slept very well last night, but I couldn’t keep my eyes open and my head kept falling down and it only got worse and worse from there. It was a two hour class and during well 90% of it I was feeling like shit because I was constantly trying to fight it. I couldn’t keep my eyes open in anyway I kept yawning and its like my body was begging for me to lay down. The professor gave us like a five minute break and I just lowered my head onto the desk and I kid you notI fell asleep in seconds well still being very vivid of what was going on around me like I remember seeing people leaving the class and talking right outside the door to each each other

And I even remember, checking with the professor was doing so that I could rest my head without him seeing and the second that class started again I immediately sat straight. Now I wasn’t feeling normal in anyway, because my body had a mind of its own and I considered telling him that, but he doesn’t really like me so I didn’t try my luck. Throughout the class, I do remember some event events happening, but after like maybe 10 of the sleepy state, everything started blanking because I genuinely could physically not be in that class anymore. It got to the point where when he was facing the board, I would close my eyes and I would dead ass start dreaming for like 2 seconds and then start taking notes again. I didn’t want him to notice me so I was doing this weird thing where I was looking at his feet and if his feet were facing the board, I’d close my eyes and I’d start dreaming and completely dissociate and forget that I was in algebra (this happened multiple times and he was turned around for less than a minute) but when he faced me, I’d open my eyes and suddenly I remember where i was and what i was doing. i even was shocked that i was in algebra. at this point, I started getting concerned because I was starting to hallucinate and starting to merge dreams in reality to the point of confusion. I thought somebody may have drugged my water or something  which would be impossible because it only ever stayed in my bag. And I had nobody else near me.

I tried pinching myself and for the first few seconds it was like it all stopped and i was me again. Like for the first few seconds that I was pinching myself, I could actually focus and understand what the people around me were saying, but as my body got used to the pinching, I’d eventually snap right back into the sleepy state. it was so bad to the point where I couldn’t even keep my head straight or be straight so eventually, I realize that it might be because I was too hot and my body associated me being warm with me sleeping. So I did take my puffer jacket off, and it seemed to work, but not fully because I was still very much in that crazy ass foggy state. I remember wanting to be awake so bad because there was no reason for me to be asleep.

the fact that I would easily start daydreaming and that these dreams would penetrate reality to the point where I’d forget that I was in algebra class, sitting straight with my eyes closed, and I would actually start dreaming was starting to scare me, and I thought that there was something wrong with me, but I couldn’t do anything about it because I was scared of the professor thinking that I was either crazy or drugged. When I left his class, i was normal again. This is only happened to me before in physics class ninth grade. It was the same exact thing I would go into class perfectly fine and randomly I would get very very sleepy to the point where I would fully blank out and id use all of my energy to keep my eyes open. I did not need sleep today i slept a full 7 hours. I guess it was very scary because this hasn’t happened to me in such a long time and in ninth grade I didn’t think much of it but today it was very creepy because even after I took my jacket off that sleepy thing continued, and had only left when the class was ending. I was supposed to be writing stuff down obviously, but my vision would overlap and then the dreams and everything and I couldn’t write because I couldn’t see properly. It took so much energy for my vision to just be straight. you might not think much of it, but if this is some sort of disorder that I need to get checked, I would very much like to know and I don’t know who to ask for help because most people are just gonna tell me to just take coffee or sleep more, but this is a case where I didn’t need to do that and it has happened once previously when I was a lot younger. When I say I couldn’t keep my eyelids open, I literally mean it because if I tried, they would immediately fall down on their own.

Edit: i just checked my notes and you can literally see my handwriting go from normal to crazy when i was in that state and then back to normal",7,1769086136.0,Dreams,11,1.0,False

If you’ve spent any time searching for a dedicated, English-speaking community for expats in Buenos Aires here on Reddit, you’ve probably noticed something: **it didn't really exist.** While there are great general Argentina subs, there hasn't been a central ""hub"" specifically for the international community living in (or moving to) the Capital Federal or CABA in short.

We created this sub to bridge that gap.

Whether you are a long-term resident, a digital nomad just passing through, or someone currently packing their bags for Ezeiza, this is your space. Moving to a city as vibrant and complex as Buenos Aires comes with a steep learning curve—from navigating the ""Blue Dollar"" and finding a decent *alquiler* to discovering where the best late-night coffee is.

**Our goal is simple:** To foster a helpful, high-quality discussion space where we can share resources, ask the ""silly"" questions, and maybe even organize a few meetups.

# 📍 What can you do here?

* **Ask for Advice:** Everything from visa runs to the best health insurance (OSDE vs. Swiss Medical?).
* **Share Gems:** Found a hidden parrillada or a quiet coworking space? Let us know.
* **Connect:** Moving to a new country can be lonely. Use this sub to find your tribe.
* **Discuss Daily Life:** The highs, the lows, and the ""only in BA"" moments.

# 🚀 Get the conversation started!

Since we are brand new, let’s get to know each other. **Drop a comment below and tell us:**

1. Where are you originally from?
2. Which *barrio* do you live in (or want to live in)?
3. What is one thing you wish you knew before you moved here?

I spend effectively the rest of my day with extreme drowsiness and poor cognition. It renders me incapable of doing almost anything, and this happens every single day, always at the same time. I can get some time on the weekends to do what I want to do, but the rest of the week I only have life in me to work. Maybe it's a depression thing that stops being masked once the vyvanse wears off, I dont know.

 I try to do things like bathe, nap, even meditation...but it only helps mildly with the fact that the crash frustrates me and saps the life out of me. It doesn't help with much else.

I'm tempted to turn to weed or even take more vyvanse to offset the daily crash. I declined an afternoon booster from my doctor once since adderall IR only ever lasted like 30 minutes in my system and I rebound hard from that, too. I try coffee but it just keeps me awake and doesnt help me think. My doc acknowledges Im not digesting vyvanse correctly, I tried Mydayis an it worked all day but it overall wasn't strong enough for my ADHD symptoms and was doing worse at work. I've been trying for the past year to escape the crash and have normal energy levels all day.  I only seem to get all day relief when I take double vyvanse, but that is heavily frowned upon and I effectively rob myself of medicine for another day. I am so frustrated and so disparaged. I guess its better than it used to be -- before stimulants I was lethargic ALL day. Now it's just half. But I'm still so frustrated. I just want a normal life.

​I own that matte black, gooseneck electric kettle that you see in every coffee video. It costs nearly $200. Given the price and the ""stainless steel"" marketing, I expected it to be a BIFL (Buy It For Life) item.

​It died in just over 2 years (right after the warranty expired).

The failure point is the base electronics. But that’s not even the worst part.

​The Hidden Failure Point:
I took it apart to see if I could repair it. Inside the lid, I found a silicone gasket sitting directly in the steam path.

​After 2 years of use, the silicone was discolored and sticky/degrading.

​So not only is the electronic base built to fail, but the internal materials degrade and likely leach into the water over time.

​The Search for a True BIFL Alternative
I’ve gone back to a stovetop kettle for now, but I really miss the temperature control for my pour-over coffee.

I have run into what is probably a much more simple issue than my brain is making it out to be, so I am reaching out to the experts here. I currently utilize 2 Activities to separate my personal stuff and my work stuff (apps, web browsers, etc.). I use Dolphin already for my Work activity, so I just need to figure out something for my Personal activity.

I recently decided it would be awesome if I could use different file managers in each activity so I could have different Places/shortcuts/bookmarks/etc. So far I have tried Konqueror, Maui Index, Nemo, and Thunar. The problem I keep running into is the Places/shortcuts/bookmarks.

Konqueror seems to use the same information that Dolphin does to store the Places entry. So if I change something in one, it is changed in the other. This also happens with Maui Index.

Thunar does not seem to have the option to set custom folder icons, which I use to quickly identify folders. Nemo will let me set custom folder icons, but those custom icons do not show up in the side panel that displays Places/shortcuts/bookmarks.

I also tried Krusader, but I cannot find any option to have a side panel that shows Places/shortcuts/bookmarks, and I have not even tried to see if custom folder icons can be set or not.

I did some searching to see if there was a way to just utilize Dolphin for both Activities, but each would have its own set of Places/shortcuts/bookmarks. I found some information about Dolphin not really supporting ""profiles"" and everything else I found did not leave me feeling confident in being able to get a working solution on my own.

So if anyone has any ideas, I would greatly appreciate it. Worse comes to worst, I guess I can just use Dolphin for both Activities and have a long list of Places that serves both needs of Personal and Work, but that has not been the best experience so far for me. Thank you!!
