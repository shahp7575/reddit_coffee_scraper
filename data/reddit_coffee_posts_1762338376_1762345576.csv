I bleached my hair and dyed it bright pink with semi permanent color, then when it was faded but still there I put a coffee type of brown that was semi permanent but I didn’t like the color. So I put the same color of brown again the next day. Still wasn’t as dark as wanted to so I put a dark brown glaze a few days after that was supposed to be used on virgin hair only  and leaved it on for 40 minuets instead of 10-20. It came out as magenta. I ordered more of the coffee brown semi permanent l dyes and plan to add a bit of a green toner to cancel the red toners and conditioner so I have a mixture. But I bought this color and it’s exactly the color I want and need for school as I can’t have unnatural  colored hair  for school until I’m 16. Although this is a permamant color and not semi permanent, I only use semi permanent’s so I don’t damage my hair. If I used this color how hard would it be to bleach my whole head again in a couple of years and how would the damage look like? Also if I did use this color how would I use it, should I just put it on top of my slightly magenta hair or wait until the green toner. Pls help as I need dark hair for school now but when I’m out of school I want bleached hair so I need to know how hard it will be to bleach. Or if it’s possible ",1,1762345391.0,HairDye,0,1.0,False

I wanted to give some input and context for first time buyers, like myself. 

I see a lot of questions here asking for machine recommendations and opinions. Often there is a lot of budget but not always a good idea of what you want out of a machine, or where they are coming from. 

I used a Nespresso machine for many years. And the last 5 years a lattissima one. No complaints there. Nespresso is consistent and you know what you’re getting (especially with original line). 

But my girlfriend and I drink cappuccinos regularly (2+ each per day). And taking apart and cleaning  the 5 part milk steamer after every cup got tedious. 

I wanted to make that easier and didn’t mind getting rid of pods either. 

I didn’t want to break the bank and saw a good deal for a Philips Lattego 2300. A machine not liked much on this sub. 

My first two weeks have been nothing but positive. The coffee is quite good, espresso certainly being a lot better than Nespresso. The milk steamer is easy to use and does a similar job (not amazing, but pretty good).

So the takeaway is: Look at where you’re coming from and what you need. 

I now know how these machines work and what to expect, and didn’t break the bank finding out (250€). It certainly doesn’t hurt trying with an entry level Philips to see what you feel and what you need. Don’t let YouTube reviewers drive you crazy",1,1762345310.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

- Lost 6.2 lbs from start to finish. It was day 1 lost about 2lbs, day 2 was about 3, and the rest on day 3. Most of this was not fat, but just food stores and water. I’d say’s probably 4 lbs. The rest was fat and probably a bit of muscle mass. I did light gym on day 1 and day 2. It sucked, but I think helped. 

Tips that helped me: 
- Water with a tea bag. This was some serious help. 
- Strong black coffee. This was helpful because it suppressed my appetite. 
- Carrying my jug of water also helped a ton. Any sign on a little hunger, I just chugged water. 

Something that felt weird was adding salt to the water. For some reason it made the water feel a little bit oily or greasy. 

But anyhow, I’ll be doing another 3 day at some point in November. I’ve reached the conclusion that it’ll be worth doing one once a month or once a quarter for health benefits.

1op1bod,https://i.redd.it/mm4doe7fifzf1.png,Curious What TCM Says About Your Health? Snap a Pic of Your Tongue and I’ll Tell You,"Based on the tongue coating image, TCM holds that this lady's body shows signs of ""blood deficiency"" and ""spleen and stomach weakness.""

So in TCM, **“**blood deficiency”is kind of like when your body’s running on an empty tank — not enough good nutrients flowing around. And if your digestion is weak , that makes things worse because your body can’t absorb what it needs.

Here’s how to fix both — using normal food + easy habits:

1. Eat Smart: Be Kind to Your Stomach, Build Energy at the Same Time

TCM tip: If your digestion sucks, avoid heavy, greasy foods — go for stuff that's easy to break down.

✅ Good foods to focus on:

Grains: Millet, pumpkin, and yam — all super easy to digest. Try them in oatmeal or mashed up.

Protein: Lean beef, chicken, eggs, black beans, red beans — these help rebuild energy + healthy blood (and yes, they’re normal grocery store foods).

Veggies: Spinach, carrots, pumpkin — especially spinach, which TCM says helps build blood.

Fruits: Cherries, grapes, and (if you’re into it) a few red dates a day — great for energy and digestion.

❌ Things that mess up digestion or drain energy:

Ice water, ice cream, cold smoothies, sushi — cold stuff slows digestion in TCM.

Too much coffee or tea — 1 cup is fine, just don’t drink it on an empty stomach.

Fried or super-sugary food — TCM believes these clog digestion and block energy.

2. Lifestyle Stuff That Actually Helps

Sleep before 11 PM – Sounds basic, but TCM says midnight is “body repair time.” Late nights = low energy.

Don’t skip breakfast – A warm one is best (like oatmeal or eggs), gets your stomach working right.

Eat slow AF – Chew more. Your stomach will thank you.

3. Exercise… but Chill

Skip intense workouts if you’re already exhausted — that just burns through your energy.

Try walking, yoga, light stretching, or even “Ba Duan Jin” (a super simple Qigong routine). 20–30 mins a day is perfect.

4. Stop Overthinking Everything (Seriously)

TCM says overthinking = lost energy. Sounds fake until you realize how drained you feel after spiraling in your head.

Take 10 mins a day to zone out. Sunbathe. Listen to lo-fi music. Do nothing. It helps.

Give it a try for a week or two — it’s simple stuff, but the combo really does help with energy, digestion, and just not feeling like trash all the time.

It was at one of those big-name coffee shops, you know the type (like Starbucks but not), and honestly, I was really excited about it.

I got there a few minutes early. The manager came, greeted me, pointed to a table and said, 'I'll be with you in just a second.' So I sat down. And waited. I scrolled through my phone. And waited some more. After about 25 minutes, the manager reappeared, mumbled something about the morning rush, and then asked if I had somewhere else to be. I told him no, I could wait, so he promised again it would be 'just a few more minutes.' Another 20 minutes passed. Nothing. No one came to talk to me.

At this point, I had reached my limit. I decided to leave, but I wanted to be professional and let them know I was going. I looked around, and the manager I had spoken to was nowhere to be found. I had to go up to a random barista and ask him to please tell his manager that I couldn't wait any longer.

Honestly, the level of disrespect is unreal. Why schedule an interview if you're not even available to conduct it? They chose the time, not me.

I'd say yes to every social invite, keep myself constantly busy with plans and people, then feel completely drained and resentful every single time. I figured I was just bad at socializing or maybe broken somehow.

Eventually I realized it wasn't a social skills issue, it was what I'd call an energy depletion issue. My presence felt weak because I was constantly leaking energy into every interaction, every obligation, every person who demanded my attention. So instead of trying to force myself to be more extroverted, I started protecting my energy through intentional solitude BEFORE I hit burnout.

Now I schedule literally sacred alone time every single day. Mornings are completely mine - no calls, no texts, no scrolling, just me and silence. I'll go for walks without headphones, sit with coffee without distractions, journal without performing for anyone. I basically recharge in solitude so the rest of my day I can actually show up as my full self. The more time I spend alone, the stronger my presence becomes around others.

Then I switched from constant availability to strategic socializing. Instead of being accessible 24/7 and saying yes to everything, I'm selective about when and with whom I spend energy. Quality over quantity. I show up fully present for fewer people rather than being half-present for everyone. Way less energy drain when interactions are intentional.

The final thing that shifted everything was noticing how different I felt after solitude versus after being constantly around people. After alone time, I felt grounded, clear, almost magnetic. After too much socializing, I felt scattered, depleted, like a dimmer version of myself. That awareness made solitude non-negotiable instead of something I felt guilty about.

That combo of daily solitude, selective socializing, and awareness of my energy has completely changed my presence. People literally comment that I seem different - more confident, more centered, more ""there."" It's not that I became more charismatic. I just stopped scattering my energy everywhere and started cultivating it in silence.",1,1762344714.0,GodFrequency,2,1.0,False

1op14ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1op14ep/help_me_find_the_book/,Help me find the book,"As the prez of the Iron Vultures MC, Rock has everything under control.
I never thought I had a biological daughter.
Until a tiny genius named Rory marches in with a backpack full of crayons and chaos.
She didn't step in and lifted her chin.
""Excuse me, is Oliver Carter here?""
In the quiet, my name-my previous wrong name?
A hundred calculations tripped over each other in my head and then fell silent, all at once, as the kid's eyes found mine.
""Rock,"" I said automatically. ""I'm Rock.""
I lifted a hand and walked forward, slow, palms open like I was approaching a startled cat. Up close, she had my eyebrows and a mouth.
""What's your name?"" I asked.
She straightened, professional. ""Aurora Garcia.""
I crouched to Rory's level. Up close, the deja vu hit harder. Same eyes. Same ridge in the brow. Same ""don't test me"" mouth. My stomach did an elevator drop.
“Who was your mom?” I asked.
She took a breath like she was about to jump into a pool. ""Alina Garcia.""
The woman 5 years ago!!!
My heartbeat skipped like a scratched record. 
It turns out she is really my daughter.
————————

The clubhouse had two speeds: too loud and police report. We were currently idling between them while my fifteen-year-old sister, Harley Jones, turned the main room into a teen-drama stage and my step-old-man Axel paced like a guard dog who'd just learned about boys.
She hopped off the bar with the grace of a cat plotting murder. As she swanned past Trevor she stage-whispered, ""If I never speak to you again it's only because my father has ten cameras and a shovel."" Trevor nodded like he'd been handed a prophecy.
I thumped the battered piston on the table. ""Vultures-church.""
Doors opened. Brothers drifted in from the garage, the bay, the alley where someone had been teaching a scooter to do crimes. Ghost (chaos with tattoos) shoulder-checked Brute (huge, cheerful, probably bench-presses refrigerators) through the threshold. Diesel (calm, engineer brain) carried a clipboard like a crucifix. Rage (temper like a matchbook) arrived last, bumping fists with Knox, Trigger, and Maverick-serious faces, serious cut marks, serious ability to make bad ideas sound like strategy.
I planted at the head of the long table. The church room was our sanctum: matte walls, old maps, fresh threats, and no witnesses. The door swung shut; the noise of the main room muffled. No women. No kids. No excuses.
""Phones off,"" I said.
Clicks. Thuds. Someone's screen chirped and Rage glared at it like he could intimidate pixels. Silence settled, and with it that live-wire hum that happens when a room full of men decides-to be smart or to be stupid.
""Border's quiet after Friday,"" I started. ""Reapers blinked first. Keep the line polite and iron. Diesel-accounts?""
He slid folders down the table with surgical accuracy. ""Parts supplier paid. The charity ride fund is solvent, unless Brute keeps signing receipts with smiley faces.""
Brute folded his arms. ""Brand consistency.""
""Stop branding legal documents with emoticons,"" Diesel said.
I tapped the piston. ""Security-Ghost?""
Ghost grinned. ""Upgrading cams. Motion. Night vision. Knox and Trigger will handle install. Maverick's got eyes on the alley.""
Maverick nodded once. A man of two words a week. Much like Ghost before Auntie Tash corrupted him with feelings and words.
""And the Tito issue?"" Diesel asked.
""Tito who?"" Ghost said innocently.
""The one selling 'discount' cameras out of a cooler,"" Diesel said.
Ghost shrugged. ""They were cold. Means they run cool.""
""That's not-"" Diesel inhaled like a disappointed dad. ""We'll buy from the catalog.""
""Border,"" Rage cut in, trying to behave and losing. ""Reaper scouts were sniffing the warehouse last night. I had words.""
""Words?"" I said.
""Chose short ones,"" he said. ""Easier to understand.""
Knox smothered a laugh. Trigger didn't bother.
I leaned back, let the room breathe. ""No heat unless I light it. We don't start problems; we end them politely. Copy?""
Nods all around, including a grudging one from Rage, who looked like he slept hugging a complaint.
From outside, a thud, then Harley's voice: ""I WAS LEAVING, DAD."" Axel's rumble answered, then the main door slammed. Good. Church boundary respected.
""Charity ride,"" I said. ""Friday. We do the school supply run, shake hands, smile in photos, pretend we don't bite.""
Ghost raised a hand. ""Can we bite if asked politely?""
""No.""
Brute slouched forward, eager. ""I can do clown wrangler.""
""There are no clowns,"" Diesel said.
""There are always clowns,"" Brute said gravely. ""They just aren't honest about it.""
Trigger cleared his throat. ""PD liaison says they want the route pinned by Wednesday. I'll email.""
""Do it,"" I said. ""Keep the cop who likes us liking us.""
The AC rattled. Someone's chair squeaked like a guilty conscience. The room settled into rhythm: report, quip, decision, move. I thrive here. Authority fits me like the kutte, heavy in a good way.
Then the rhythm wobbled.
A prospect's voice, faint through the wall: ""Uh-Prez?""
I held up a hand for quiet. ""Church.""
""Yes, sir, sorry, sir-just, uh-""
Knox's mouth twitched. Rage rolled his eyes. Diesel stared at the door like he could weld it shut with concentration.
""Later,"" I said.
A beat. The prospect's shoes scuffed away, like a dog who has realized the steak is not for him.
Ghost leaned over to Brute. Whispered, ""Bet he dropped something."" Brute whispered back, ""Bet it was himself."" Rage kicked their chair legs under the table. Both men yelped.
I smacked the piston. ""Focus."" I slid a paper toward Maverick. ""Your buildschedule-""
The ceiling fan hiccuped. Stopped. Started. Stopped again. All eyes went up.
""Ghost?"" I said.
""Wasn't me,"" he lied automatically.
Diesel stood, reached with a rag, tugged the chain. The fan dropped a single dusty screw onto the table like a sad meteor.
""Great,"" Rage muttered. ""Add decapitation to the agenda.""
""No one's getting decapitated,"" I said. ""If a fan takes your head off, you deserved it.""
Brute pointed at the screw. ""Souvenir.""
""No,"" Diesel said. ""Evidence.""
Knox rubbed his jaw, thinking. ""We good on tires for the weekend?""
""Warehouse is stocked,"" Trigger said. ""If Rage stops doing burnouts in the bay.""
Rage slouched deeper. ""I do them respectfully.""
""Respectfully?"" Diesel said. ""On my floor?""
""With cones.""
""That makes it worse.""
I let the bickering run for nine seconds. Then I shut it down with a look I learned from Axel: not angry, disappointed in advance. The room snapped back like a rubber band.
""Last item,"" I said. ""Prospect class is light. We recruit careful."" I scanned the table. Tired faces, familiar scars, men I'd die for who I hoped would never make me prove it. ""No cowboys. No heroes. We build quiet. We stay fed.""
They nodded, solemn now. Here's the thing about slapstick: underneath it there's calculus. The comedy keeps the edges from slicing you every day.
I reached for the gavel.
From the main room came a clatter like a vending machine losing a fight, followed by Diesel's sacred coffee pot screaming its glassy death scream.
Ghost winced. ""That sounded expensive.""
""Church is adjourned,"" I said fast, because I love peace but I love my coffee more. ""Go fix whatever dumb-""
We stood. Chairs scraped. Rage opened the door-
-and froze, shoulders squaring. Not danger. Something stranger.
I stepped up beside him.
The main room lay in the neon-lit mess of our regular sins: flyers scattered, a toppled chair, the vending machine pitched forward on two metal feet with Knox and Trigger rushing to lever it back while Brute reached under to rescue the aforementioned coffee pot like a man pulling a baby from a river.
In the doorway to the outside, the afternoon sun burned in a rectangle.
Inside that light stood a very small girl with a very serious backpack and curls like someone had drawn them on with a pencil and then refused to erase a single loop.
She didn't step in. She put her small hand on the jamb like someone had taught her to be respectful of rooms that weren't hers and lifted her chin.
""Excuse me,"" she said, loud and brave, like a librarian in a hurricane. ""Is Oliver Carter here?""
No one answered. No women or girls in church is the rule; church was over-but the weight of it still hung in the air, that solemn hush that says what you say now might change something forever.
In the quiet, my name-my wrong name-hit harder than any punch.
Harley, somewhere beyond the porch, gasped, ""She's so cute I'm dying."" Axel's instant reply: ""You'll die later.""
A hundred calculations tripped over each other in my head and then fell silent, all at once, as the kid's eyes found mine like they'd been born knowing what they were looking for.
I don't freeze. I don't hesitate. I don't stare.
I did all three.
Nobody breathed. The only sound was the vending machine settling back onto four legs and Brute whispering to the coffee pot, ""You're safe now, little guy.""
The kid in the doorway did not flinch at two dozen grown men in leather staring like they'd never seen a child before. She just adjusted the strap on her tiny backpack and repeated, very politely, ""Is Oliver Carter here?""
My mouth worked once. Habit tried to speak first. ""Only my mom calls me that.""
Her brow furrowed, genuinely interested. ""Interesting boundary. Are you Oliver?""
""Rock,"" I said automatically. ""I'm Rock.""
""Oh,"" she said, relieved. ""Good. Then the probability just went up.""
Rage leaned toward me, sotto voce. ""What the-""
I lifted a hand and walked forward, slow, palms open like I was approaching a startled cat. Up close, she had my eyebrows and a mouth that looked like it was thinking of jokes it wasn't allowed to tell.
""Hey, kid,"" I said. ""You lost?""
She considered. ""Geographically? No. Emotionally? Some.""
Ghost made a muffled aw noise that sounded suspiciously like his soul trying to escape.
""What's your name?"" I asked.
She straightened, professional. ""Aurora Garcia. But everyone calls me Rory. I prefer Rory because it's efficient.""
""Efficient is good,"" I said. My voice came out softer than I meant. ""Who brought you, Rory?""
""I brought me."" She said it like obviously. ""Two buses and a nice lady at the corner store who said this was a 'terrible idea, sweetheart' and then drew me a map anyway.""
Diesel pressed a bottle of water into my hand without looking away from the kid, like we were handling nitroglycerin. Knox drifted to the side window, checking the street. Trigger hovered near the alarm panel. Maverick did what Maverick does: watched, silent, taking impressions like film.
Outside, Harley's whisper-scream leaked through the open front door: ""SHE IS SO SMALL."" Axel's return rumble: ""Stay out of church."" Harley: ""IT'S OVER."" Axel: ""THE RULE IS CONCEPTUAL.""
I crouched to Rory's level. Up close, the deja vu hit harder. Same eyes. Same ridge in the brow. Same ""don't test me"" mouth. My stomach did an elevator drop.
""Okay, Rory,"" I said. ""Where's your mom?""
Her face did not change. ""At home. Although home is currently a fluid situation.""
I glanced at Diesel. He gave me the tiniest nod that meant copy; I'm already on it.
""Is she okay?"" I asked.
A beat. ""Not... optimized."" The word was too big for her mouth; she got it anyway. ""I left her a note. I packed essentials."" She patted the backpack. ""Snacks, money, bus card, a list.""
Ghost, unable not to, lifted a hand like he was in school. ""What kind of snacks.""
""Graham crackers,"" she said. ""And the circle candies that make red tongues.""
""Excellent,"" Ghost said reverently.
I glanced over my shoulder. ""Everyone back it up. Give the lady some air.""
Brothers shuffled backward in a choir of boots and apology, immediately tripping over fundraiser buttons. Brute pinwheeled, caught himself on Rage's shoulder; Rage didn't move, because Rage is made of anger and rebar. Knox snagged Ghost's collar before he pecked the floor. Coffee pot: still alive.
I looked back at the kid. ""You said probability went up when I said Rock. Why's that?""
She unzipped the front pouch of her backpack and produced a folded paper with more highlighter than a finals week binder. She presented it to me like a subpoena.
""I made a probability tree,"" she said. ""Mom said a few names. 'Oliver Carter' was the only one that triangulated with 'school,' 'motorcycle boy,' and 'looks just like him' as per Ms. Toni at the laundromat.""
A cough from somewhere. Laughter brutally suppressed.
I unfolded the paper. It was a map of LA bus lines taped to notebook pages, arrows, scribbles, and three boxes labeled OLIVER CARTER at different corners, each with percentages. Beside Rock someone had drawn a skull and a tiny smiley face with angry eyebrows. My chest did that drop again.
""Who helped you with all this?"" I asked, already knowing the answer.
""Me,"" she said, then amended, honest to a fault, ""and Google.""
""Solid coauthor,"" I said faintly.
Rory leaned past me and squinted at the room like a building inspector. ""This place has bad outlets.""
Diesel clutched his clipboard to his chest like she'd proposed. ""Finally. Someone who sees me.""
Rage crossed his arms. ""Kid's cute. Kid's still a stranger.""
""Right,"" I said, flipping a switch in my head from feelings to procedure. ""Maverick-door. Knox-eyes on the street. Trigger-call Doc. I want a wellness check that doesn't spook her. Diesel-juice box.""
Diesel blinked. ""I don't-""
Harley's arm snaked around the jamb like she was auditioning for a horror movie and deposited a juice box into Diesel's hand without crossing the threshold. She wiggled her fingers at Rory. ""Hi tiny queen."" Axel's arm immediately appeared and yanked Harley back into the sunlight like a fisherman landing a trout.
Rory regarded the juice box, nodded once. ""Acceptable.""
""Mind if we sit?"" I asked.
She gave me an assessing look that was so painfully familiar Brute made a strangled noise and had to cough to cover it. ""We can sit,"" she allowed. ""But I have questions first.""
""Shoot.""
""Why does everyone keep looking at me like I'm a grenade.""
""Because this room is full of idiots who don't know how to handle delicate things,"" I said, and the men nodded solemnly like a congregation admitting sin.
She considered that, then tugged me by the hand-my hand-and led me to the couch. We sat. The couch squeaked. The room stared. The vending machine decided not to vindictively drop again. Progress.
""Okay, Rory,"" I said. ""Ask away.""
She consulted a notebook. ""Are you Oliver Carter.""
""I'm Rock,"" I said. ""Oliver if my mother is mad at me.""
""Do you know my mother.""
""Depends on your mother's name.""
She took a breath like she was about to jump into a pool. ""Alina Garcia.""

I started getting up super early hoping to alleviate some depression symptoms, but what I’ve noticed is it’s nearly completely alleviated my urge to have a drink. I mean I have to start my bedtime routine at 7 so it’s just not something I consider.
Arthur brooks has an article in the Atlantic that is a great motivator. “Six ways to rise early and lift your mood”
And to be clear: I don’t get up at 5:00 am to work out. It’s my relaxing time. I have coffee, a bubble bath, read, etc… but I don’t do the whole spartan 5am exercise cold plunge drink raw eggs nonsense. I luxuriate. And it’s the best part of my day! And I think it broke me out of the thought pattern of “time to relax in the evening means you need a nice cocktail”. I kinda stumbled into this hack but I’m really happy with the suprise benefit. Also, my depression symptoms have decreased, probably in no small part to the decreased drinks/urge for a drink.

1op0x00,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1op0x00,"Trip Report for Fenghuang, Phoenix Ancient Town, with photos","**Trip Report for Fenghuang aka Phoenix Ancient Town.**

My travel was 1-month in China and 4-night stop in HK from 16th August – 19th September 2025.

My travel route was Beijing – Luoyang – Dengfeng – Kaifeng – Chongqing – Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan – Furong – Fenghuang – Wangxiangu – Hengdian Film Studios – Shanghai – HK.

I hope this information will be useful for those planning a trip to China. I’ve tried to list and describe as much as possible and highlighted some important parts. I’ve added AUD prices, the hotels that I stayed at, reviewed attractions that I visited in each city or town. Its my first time writing such a report and detailed itinerary so please be kind with the feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!

**NOTE: PHOTOS ATTACHED TO THIS POST IS OF FENGHUANG ONLY.**

**FENGHUANG = 1 day / night, but I wished I had another night here…**

My Furong home-stay owners dropped me off at **Furongzhen train station and I caught a 45min train at 9am to Fenghuanggucheng train station.** I jumped into a taxi, not a DiDi, and it was about a 10km / 20min drive to my Fenghuang hotel for 26 yuan (if you choose a hotel further down the **Tuojiang River** – further away from the train station – add another 15min driving time as you have to zig-zag and detour around the ancient town, there’s lots of narrow, one way roads as well so give extra time to head back to the train station) **I stayed at Jinshuian River View Hotel for 1 night = $32 AUD, booked on Trip.com and it was amazing!** I couldn’t check into my room early: 10am, but **the staff showed me my room then sent maps and information about Fenghuang via WeChat to me.** My room had a queen bed, huge projection screen (you have to turn off all lights, close the blinds / curtains to see whats the screen clearly), private bathroom with sit-down toilet and stand-up shower stand, big clothes rack, the usual x2 500ml bottled water and a kettle. I also had a balcony that overlooked the Tuojiang River: I could open the huge glass doors but I didn’t as I wanted the air-con on and room to stay cool.

I highly recommend this hotel: they made my stay super easy and really enjoyable. There’s several restaurants around the hotel, a convenience store next door, Mixue beside it, and the **taxis or DiDis can drive right to the hotel door – you don’t have to drag your suitcase through the ancient town.** Its about 10min walk to the main strip of Fenghuang (where everyone hangs out), the hotel is close enough but far away from the partying, karaoke, loud music that starts around 8pm to 11:30pm-12am – every night. When I sent a WeChat message to the hotel staff asking if there was a Luckin Coffee nearby, the staff responded within 5min, with a pinpoint map location that you open up into Amap… After I got my Luckin Coffee fix (which took nearly 30min wait as its so popular and that was the closest branch to the ancient town), I started exploring Fenghuang from about 11am.

**NOTE: names of attractions in Fenghuang mentioned / bold font will vary on each map so this is a rough guide...**

My first stop was **Nanhuamen Gate**, which is just outside of the ancient town and 5min walk from my hotel. **Fenghuang Bridge or Nanhua Bridge is right next to the gate and this a must visit as you can see most of Fenghuang ancient town and Tuojiang River from up here, plus you also have a great view of Wind Fengyu Bridge or Yunqiao Bridge (really beautiful) which is in many photos.** Next, I headed to **Fenghuang Cultural Square** as I really wanted to see **the big Fenghuang Phoenix statue** - I think a lot of people skip this area and only focus on sightseeing along the river which is a big shame! The **Tourism Office** and **West Gate Entrance to Fenghuang** is also here – I saw many foreigners get dropped off with their suitcases at the West Gate and had to wheel over cobblestone-like pathways and uneven footpaths to find their hotel inside the ancient town (I was so glad I wasn’t one of them!).

**FYI, visiting Fenghuang ancient town and walking along the river is FREE (unlike Furong), but you can also pay around 128 CNY, per adult, to enter certain buildings / landmarks / attractions. From my understanding, your paid ticket includes visiting the following places: East Gate Tower, Chongde Hall, Yang’s Ancestral Hall, Former Residence of Shen Congwen, Former Residence of Xiong Xiling, Fenghuang Ancient Town Museum, Longevity Wanshou Palace, and a Tuojiang River Boating ride. If you want to just visit one of these, you can also buy tickets separately at the door. You can pay to watch a 90min outdoor show at the far end of Tuojiang River, located pass Wuqiao Bridge.** As I was here only for one day / night, I didn’t have time to visit any of these! If you are in Fenghuang for 2 days / nights, you will have time to explore it all. Other places of interest that I could see on maps are the **Former Residence of Tian Xinghu, Tian’s Family Ancestral Hall, Chaoyang Palace, Dacheng Palace,, Chen Baozhen’s Aristocratic Family Home, Temple of the Queen of Heaven and Zhunti Nunnery.**

Now, I will admit it – I got lost wandering around the ancient town area HAHA There are many alley-ways, a few dead-ends and some pathways that just take you around in circles! It’s not a simple grid layout type town. All the footpaths are curvy and weave into another lane. Its fun exploring – quite the adventure, but also annoying at the same time!!! I looked at the street maps, information boards posted around the ancient town and used Amap to guide me to **East Main Street**, walk down **South Street**, **Shi Lane**, **Shiban Street**, **Dongzheng Street**, **Wenxing Street** and **Laoying Street** = the main pedestrian strips of Fenghuang. Some streets had many shops, restaurants and cafes that were open and busy, some streets were empty or quiet, and some streets had no buildings open but were filled with table stalls and vendors lined outside with Miao ladies selling a wide range of products, such as:

- wooden magnets: 5 CNY to 20 CNY depending on design and size
- postcards: 5+ CNY
- round silk embroidered fans: 15+ CNY
- round double-sided fabric embroidered fans: 30+ CNY
- round embroidered zipped coin pouches: 10+ CNY
- round fabric embroidered drink coasters: x2 (a set) for 15 CNY
- mobile phone dangling wooden charms: 9 CNY = the cheapest I saw anywhere in China so I grabbed x10!!!
- traditional wooden hairpins with resin or glass flowers and dangling charms: 10 CNY to 30 CNY depending on design
- ceramic tea cups: 5 CNY+ and ceramic tea pots: 20 CNY+ = I wished I had the luggage space to buy more!

**If you don’t know what to buy in China and you’re in Fenghuang, I recommend you buy from these Miao ladies dressed in traditional outfits, who are sitting in front of tables filled with embroidered items, scattered throughout the ancient town and along the river.** You can bargain with them (they are not aggressive and won’t chase you or yell at you) or keep walking to see what else the next person is selling and for the right price. For example, I really wanted the round double-sided fabric embroidered fans and a lady was selling them for 45 CNY. She wouldn’t drop her price so I didn’t buy from her. Later on, I came across another group of ladies who sold them for 30 CNY and I didn’t bargain. I bought several as I thought it was a very good price considering the design: you get two images instead of one, and it’s all embroidered (probably machine, not 100% handmade) but this is something that I can’t get in Sydney, Australia especially not for that price!

Anyways, in between stopping every 20 metres to take photos and the shopping, I had lunch at a small restaurant near the **East Gate. I ate a fat rice noodle soup with some beef cubes for 20 CNY, 500ml bottled water for 3 CNY to 5 CNY (depending where you buy) and I tried several paddle-pop stick flavoured ice-creams for 5 CNY to 10 CNY each, to help cool me down throughout the day.** There’s Mixue and Cotti Coffee here, no Luckin Coffee inside the ancient town – not that I saw. **I also had some dessert: coconut milk with grass jelly, an array of nuts and fresh fruit for 20 CNY and it was really good!**

Near the East Gate, is the **Rainbow Bridge** which is filled with snacks stalls, a yoghurt store, a convenience store, some souvenirs, tea shop, etc. I didn’t buy anything here. Around the Rainbow Bridge, you will see the **Diaojiaolou traditional wooden stilt houses** (which I think look better at night when its lit up). Around 2pm, I walked along the Tuojiang River to take day time photos. **It takes about 2hrs to complete a full loop around the river**. By 4pm, I ended back at where I started, near the East Gate, then strolled along the **Fenghuang Ancient City Wall** that runs parallel to the river and ends at the **North Gate**. From there, it was about 10min walk back to my hotel for a rest, shower and to unpack for the night.

About 7pm, I headed out and crossed the river to **Bar Street** for dinner. I decided to try different local snack type foods instead of a proper sit-down in a restaurant type of meal. **I had a huge steamed rice thing with egg, shrimp and cabbage drenched in soy sauce for 20 CNY, a deep fried round spicy shrimp cake for 10 CNY, and six boiled pork and vegetable dumplings in a paper bowl for 15 CNY.** This area was very noisy, crowded and dark (not a lot of street lights). Everyone visits Fenghuang from sunset onwards for the night lights. It’s a huge difference compared to the day time!

Many of the good viewpoints or lookout areas are packed with girls dressed in hanfu – traditional outfits, mainly Miao style here, with professional photographers. It was challenging to find a spot to take a photo of the scenery let alone of yourself being here! I gave up trying to take some selfie shots and continued making my way along the river, pass **Wanming Pagoda Tower**, **Guan Gate**, **The Big Waterwheel**, and to **Wuqiao Bridge**, which gives you a really nice view looking back into Fenghuang ancient town and down Tuojiang River. Most people don’t walk all the way down to Wuqiao Bridge. It’s really quiet at this end of the river, like maybe 20 people during the day and at night. Everyone hangs around Rainbow Bridge and Wanming Pagoda Tower which is the centre of Fenghuang, where all the cafes and bars are playing loud music, singing karaoke etc.

As I was travelling alone, I didn’t cross the **Tuojiang Stepping Stones** or any of the other wooden boardwalks over the river. Its not well lit, there are many people queued up to walk over these, especially at night. I completed a full loop along the river and climbed up Fenghuang Ancient City Wall again to look down into the river. **There are people dressed in costumes, singing and danging in the middle of the river on a stage and digital light shows (mainly of flowers and abstract art) screened on man-made water fountains.** Its a very colourful and festive atmosphere. I was back in my hotel around 10:30pm and crashed by midnight…

**NOTE: as mentioned, I recommend one full day and night to visit Fenghuang ancient town and to enjoy walking along the river. If you have limited time, then arrive around 4pm so you have time for check-in, watch sunset, dinner then complete the full 2hr walk along the river for the night lights and stay overnight. If you have a lot of time, stay in Fenghuang for two nights so you can relax and visit the paid attractions on the second day.**

I really enjoyed my time in Fenghuang and I would revisit this ancient town. If I do return – I hope I can, I would like to stay for three nights so I can visit all the paid attractions and have some down time here, like stop in Fenghuang at the halfway point of my trip around China. It’s affordable, there’s plenty to see and do or don’t do anything at all! **Some people think Fenghuang its fake, a tourist trap, all ancient water towns are the same etc. but Fenghuang is famous and popular to visit for a reason. I think worth your time. It really is a beautiful place to visit during the day and at night for all the lights!**

Im going to post a bunch of photos now, as proof!!! See my media posts for evidence.

Thanks for reading my long post! 

Next will be about Wangxiangu, then Hengdian Film Studios and then Shanghai.

## Why Choose an All-Inclusive Holiday in Agadir?

Going all-inclusive is more than just a booking choice; it's a mindset. It's the key to unlocking a truly stress-free vacation. Here’s why it’s the smart way to experience Agadir:

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Predictable Budgeting:** The single biggest advantage. You pay one price upfront, and your accommodation, food, drinks, and often a host of activities are all covered. No nasty surprises on your final bill.
*   **Ultimate Relaxation:** Forget constantly reaching for your wallet. Want a cocktail by the pool? It’s included. Fancy a mid-afternoon snack from the beach bar? It's covered. This freedom lets you completely unwind.
*   **Endless Entertainment & Activities:** Most Agadir resorts are mini-holiday villages. From multiple swimming pools and tennis courts to kids' clubs and nightly entertainment, there's always something to do without ever leaving the grounds.
*   **Hassle-Free Planning:** Searching for restaurants for every meal can be a chore. All-inclusive resorts offer a variety of dining options, from expansive buffets serving international cuisine to à la carte restaurants offering Moroccan and other speciality dishes.

## What Does ""All Inclusive"" in Agadir Actually Mean?

This is a crucial question. While ""all-inclusive"" is a fantastic concept, the details can vary between resorts. Generally, you can expect:

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **All Meals:** Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, usually served in a main buffet restaurant.
*   **Drinks:** A selection of local alcoholic drinks (beer, wine, spirits) and non-alcoholic beverages like soft drinks, tea, and coffee.
*   **Snacks:** Light snacks and ice cream are often available at designated times throughout the day, often at the pool or beach bar.

> **Pro-Tip:** Always check the fine print! Some premium resorts include everything, while others may charge for imported drinks, specific à la carte restaurants (sometimes requiring a reservation), spa treatments, and certain off-site excursions.

## Finding the Perfect Agadir All-Inclusive Resort: What to Look For

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

Agadir is packed with fantastic resorts, but the ""best"" one depends on your personal travel style. Here’s what to consider:

**Location and Views**
Are you a beachfront purist who wants to step from your room directly onto the sand? Or would you prefer a resort closer to the bustling Agadir Marina, with its chic cafes and shops? The location sets the tone for your holiday.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**Amenities for Your Vibe**
*   **For Families:** Look for resorts with kids' clubs, splash parks, shallow pools, and family-friendly entertainment schedules.
*   **For Couples:** Seek out resorts offering adults-only sections, serene spa facilities, quiet pool areas, and romantic à la carte dining options.
*   **For Social Groups:** Find a resort with multiple pools, lively pool bars, sports facilities (like beach volleyball), and a bustling evening entertainment program.

**Dining and Drinking Options**
One buffet can get repetitive after a week. Look for resorts that boast several dining venues, like a Moroccan speciality restaurant, an Italian trattoria, or a seafood grill. A choice of bars is also a plus, from a lively main bar to a quiet, atmospheric lounge.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**Check Recent Reviews**
Before you book, dive into recent reviews on platforms like TripAdvisor or Google Reviews. Look for consistent comments about the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the rooms, the attentiveness of the staff, and the overall atmosphere. Pay attention to what people say *now*, not what they said five years ago.

## Beyond the Resort: Making the Most of Your Agadir Holiday

All-inclusive doesn't mean all-trapped-in! Agadir has a rich culture and beautiful scenery waiting to be explored. Plan a few excursions to see the real Morocco:

*   **Explore Agadir Marina:** Stroll along the waterfront, admire the luxury yachts, and enjoy a fresh-squeezed orange juice at one of the many cafes.
*   **Bargain Hunt at Souk El Had:** This is the city's main market. A vibrant, chaotic, and unforgettable experience. It’s the perfect place to buy spices, leather goods, lamps, and souvenirs. Remember to haggle!
*   **Get a View from the Kasbah:** Hike or taxi up to the Agadir Oufella (Kasbah) ruins for breathtaking panoramic views of the city, the bay, and the Atlantic Ocean. It's especially beautiful at sunset.
*   **Day Trip to Paradise Valley:** Just a short drive away, this stunning oasis in the High Atlas Mountains features lush palm groves, natural rock pools, and incredible hiking. A refreshing contrast to the coastal heat.

It's the undisputed champion of movie nights, study sessions, and lazy Sunday afternoons. But let's be honest: the options for making it at home can be... underwhelming. Microwave bags are often loaded with chemicals and questionable oils, while the stovetop method can feel like a high-stakes gamble with burnt kernels and a greasy mess.

Enter the **Dash popcorn maker**. You've probably seen this brightly colored, compact gadget all over social media. It promises fast, fluffy, and healthy popcorn with the push of a button. But is it just another trendy kitchen gadget that'll be collecting dust in six months, or is it a true game-changer?

## What Exactly is the Dash Popcorn Maker?

At its core, the **Dash popcorn maker** is a hot air popper. It’s a deceptively simple device: a small base with a heating element and a fan, topped by a clear chamber that holds the kernels. Unlike traditional methods, it uses **no oil** to pop the corn. Instead, it circulates hot air around the kernels until they explode into fluffy white clouds of deliciousness.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dash%20popcorn%20maker)

Its main selling points are its tiny footprint (it's about the size of a large coffee mug), its vibrant colors, and its claim to be incredibly fast and easy to use.

## Key Features & Benefits We Loved

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dash%20popcorn%20maker)

We put this little machine through its paces, and several features really stood out.

*   **Compact and Counter-Friendly:** This is its superpower. It's small enough to live on your kitchen counter without getting in the way. It's perfect for small apartments, dorm rooms, RVs, or even for taking to the office for a communal snack.
*   **Rapid Hot Air Popping:** We're talking fast. In under 3 minutes, you can have a large bowl of freshly popped popcorn. The machine whirs to life and starts shooting out fluffy kernels almost immediately.
*   **Healthy and Guilt-Free:** Since it uses only hot air, you're getting popcorn with zero fat or calories from oil. It’s a blank canvas for you to be as healthy (or indulgent) as you want with your toppings.
*   **Effortless Cleanup:** This is a huge win. The popping chamber and measuring cup top (which also doubles as a butter melter) are not dishwasher safe, but they're incredibly easy to wash by hand with a bit of soap and water. No greasy, burnt-on mess to scrub.

> **Hot Tip:** Place a large bowl under the chute before you start. The machine shoots the popcorn out with some serious force!

## Our Hands-On Experience: From Kernel to Bowl

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dash%20popcorn%20maker)

**Setup:** Took it out of the box, wiped it down, and it was ready to go. No assembly required. A simple measuring cup is included, which is perfectly portioned for one serving.

**The Popping Process:** We used the included measuring cup to add kernels to the chamber. We plugged it in, turned it on, and the show began. The machine is a bit noisy, like a small hairdryer, which is to be expected. Within 30 seconds, the first few kernels started popping and launching into the bowl. The process is mesmerizing to watch!

In about two and a half minutes, the popping slowed to a trickle. We turned it off and had a big bowl of popcorn. There were very few unpopped kernels left behind, and most of those were diverted into a small collection area at the base.

**The Result:** The popcorn was light, airy, and perfectly crisp. It's not the movie theater-style popcorn you get from a kettle popper (it's less dense), but for a healthy and quick snack, it was fantastic.

## Pros and Cons: The Honest Truth

No product is perfect. Here’s a balanced look at what we loved and what could be better.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dash%20popcorn%20maker)

### **Pros:**

*   ✅ **Incredibly Fast:** Popcorn in under 3 minutes.
*   ✅ **Super Easy to Use:** One button. That's it.
*   ✅ **Healthy:** Oil-free popping for a lower-calorie snack.
*   ✅ **Minimal Cleanup:** The easiest popcorn-making method to clean, period.

### **Cons:**

*   ❌ **Can Be Loud:** The fan is noisy, but only for a couple of minutes.
*   ❌ **Some Kernals Fly Wild:** You need a large, wide bowl to catch all the popcorn. Some rogue kernels can fly over the edge.
*   ❌ **Not for Butter Lovers (During Popping):** Since it's an air popper, you can't add butter *during* the popping process like some other machines. You have to add it after.

4.  Toss well.

### **Sweet and Salty Caramel Drizzle**
1.  Pop the corn and spread it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

However, it started to become 'I'll get this one' and the favour was never repaid. I also felt he took advantage of me. For example, often when out, I will happily buy my boyfriend a coffee and again this was never reciprocated. He was very quick to ask me to ""monzo"" money back if he got me something, conveniently forgetting I had also paid for previous things. Would this have have grown into a bigger issue down the line e.g. with bills. Many people have told me you can’t build a life with someone that selfish, particularly on ugly topics like money. his friends would bully saying he was mean with money.

One time we went out for a meal with his family for the parents anniversary. He and his sister were splitting but turns out the parents sent him some money for his half.

Just me building every day with my MacBook and co-working spaces/ coffee shops.

In that time, I launched two products. Both are now profitable and together make around **$2K/month**.

And i want to share how the last 6 months looked like 👇

1. I solved my own problems

I didn’t chase random ideas. Both products came from problems I personally faced while working. When you build something for yourself, it’s easier to stay motivated and know what matters most.



2. I launched early

The first version of each product took about 2–3 weeks to build. It was not fancy but simple, but it worked. Getting early users helped me understand what to fix instead of guessing.



3. I kept everything simple

Each product solves one clear problem. I didn’t waste time on logos, animations, or complex features. People care more about the value than how cool it looks.



4. My setup

My stack is simple and helps me move fast:

* NextJS 
* Supabase
* Vercel
* Polar
* Datafast
* UserJot
* Gemini



5. I shared everything online

Instead of spending time on ads or SEO, I shared updates on Reddit, Twitter and Instagram. That honesty brought real users and feedback.



6. Growth was slow but steady

I never had any viral moment. Just a few users every week, turning into more over time. Now both products make around $2K/month combined.



7. Main takeaways

* Build for yourself first.
* Launch fast.
* Keep it simple.
* Share progress publicly.
* Be patient because small steps compound.

My Next goal is **$5K MRR**.  
I am still solo, still bootstrapped, still learning.

If anyone here is also building solo, I’d love to hear what you’re working on.

Let me know and I will link both the products in comments because I don't want to spam this post with any ads.

Here’s how essay help saved my sanity,"You know that sinking feeling when you’re staring at a mountain of assignments and your brain has officially given up? Yeah… that was me last semester. Between juggling three midterms, a group project, and an application essay due the next morning, I was on the verge of a total meltdown. The caffeine jitters weren’t helping, and my laptop might as well have been plotting against me.  
  
I knew I had two options: cry into my coffee or find help fast. That’s when I came acrosse essaypro, a college essay writing service that promised no plagiarism and top-quality work. I was skeptical but really needed a way to get through the deadline.  
  
Within hours, a writer had taken over my admissions essay, following my guidelines. I finally got some sleep instead of staring blankly at my screen, and the essay came out better than I expected. It felt like having a safety net when everything was piling up.  
  
What surprised me most was how easy it was to use the service. I didn’t have to explain every little detail, and they seemed to get exactly what I needed. I’ve also tried other services before, but none made me feel this relieved or actually saved me from pulling a complete all-nighter. Honestly, knowing there’s a place that can write my college essay when things get overwhelming is a huge stress reliever. Even just having that option in the back of my mind made deadlines feel less terrifying.  
For anyone drowning in assignments, using a reliable admissions essay writing service can be a lifesaver. Sometimes asking for help isn’t cheating. It’s just surviving college.

Last month, I noticed the switch... shorter replies, less enthusiasm to make plans. When I brought it up, he said, “You’re overthinking. I’m just busy.” But then he’d still watch my stories minutes after I posted. If I became distant he would say ""Are u ok?, as if he just didn't want me to forget about him.

Another dark, quiet, lonely night in Rei’s dorm room. The smell of coffee and regret filled the room. A small light coming from a laptop atop his bed illuminated the dark room. Rei grew to like the dark; he enjoyed the company of a laptop... but ultimately, he wanted someone. Someone to love, someone to love him. As Rei pondered his choice about picking computer science as a major, his roommate, Kiki, swung the door open, flipped on the light, and demanded that he come out of his room.

“You have been in here all day, it’s not healthy!”

“Leave me alone, I have work to do, not all of us chose ART as a major.” Rei’s voice was barely above a whisper. Every word he uttered sounded like it hurt to say, like it was being torn from his throat.

Kiki dragged Rei from under the covers and told him, “I want you to succeed, but you need to get out more. Your work can wait for one day; come with us to the basketball game. We're facing our biggest rivals; it’ll be fun, promise. I can’t just let you rot in here—please, just come with us.”

There was care in Kiki’s voice that Rei just couldn’t ignore.

“Fine, I’ll get ready, just give me a minute.”

I know Kiki is just looking out for me; she’s always been like that. I shouldn’t be so hard on her.

The walk to the college gym was enjoyable; it was quiet. Rei’s thoughts came and went like waves as he walked, his heavy computer bag weighing on his shoulder.

I don’t think I’m a bad person, per se; I’m just too nothing. I never found my thing; I chose the easy, safe option. There was no other choice. I mean, you can’t follow a heart if there’s nothing on it. I’m biding my time until I can find someone to love, to devote myself to someone to—Oh, I’m here.

He arrived at the gym to the smell of rubber and sweat and the agitating noise of a referee whistle. Rei found Kiki and her friends cheering maniacally in the bleachers. Rei sat quietly, pulled out his laptop, and began to finish the work he had been pulled away from. Until the crowd went silent as a player on the opposing team, Number 8, got into a screaming match with the referee. Rei peeked up from his screen, and to his surprise, his eyes met the most beautiful guy he’d ever seen—a tall, pale, blond guy, a little on the muscular side, but still... lanky? He was insulting a 70-something-year-old ref, but he looked good doing it.

REF, ARE YOU BLIND? THAT WAS A DOUBLE!

“That’s enough, young man, you need to relax!”

COME ON MAN, HEY HEY, how’d you even get this job?

“You know that call was bull. Kick me out, see if I care, I’m outta here!”

The player was booted from the game, threw the doors open, and walked out. He looked angry, but as he walked out, tears rolled down his flushed cheeks. Rei heard the crowd chatter about how Number 8 is usually so respectful and an example for the other players. Rei felt something come over him; the urge to comfort Number 8. He’d never felt such sadness emanating from another person before. His emotions took over, and he got up to follow him out.

A surprised Kiki asked, “Where do you think you're going?”

“Bathroom,” Rei answered, with a base of urgency.

“I think that’s the loudest I’ve ever heard him speak,” Kiki said in a baffled voice.

A shout left Rei’s lips as he swung the door of the gym open, and an unusual feeling washed over him. “Hey, wait up.” The hall was quiet and drafty. The dimly lit lights added to the eerie vibe, though it was bright enough to see clearly. Number 8 was nowhere to be seen. Until Rei heard a sniffle from around the corner of the hall. Rei made his way to Number 8 and found him crouched down, hugging his knees, with tear-stained eyes.

He looks so... cute? Rei thought, quickly dropping the thought.

“Hey, are you ok?” Rei’s voice returned to its normal whisper.

“Yeah, I think. Sometimes the pressure is just too much. I mean, you practice and practice, and your fate still falls in the hands of people you don’t even know. It’s a messed-up system, and I just couldn’t take it anymore.” Oh, uhh, I’m alright, sorry I made you worry. Number 8 was still managing a smile, even as tears ran down his face.

OH MY, he’s gorgeous, unlike Rei’s previous thought—this one couldn’t be ignored.

“I saw you walk out, and you looked so sad, and I’m sorry this is weird. I’ll leave you, hope you feel better.”

“Wait!” Number 8’s hand grabbed Rei’s wrist. “You can stay. I could use some company,” Number 8 said through puffy eyes, flushed cheeks, and a rosy nose, looking so... pure.

Rei took a seat on the floor next to Number 8. Rei’s heart was still beating from the way Number 8 grabbed his wrist; his hands were so big. After a minute of silence that felt infinite, thoughts raced through Rei’s head, until Number 8 broke the silence, “So... why did you follow me? Aren’t you from the opposing college?”

Rei took a beat before answering, “Oh, umm, I don’t care much for sports. My friend brought me here, and I saw you cry, and I just kinda... acted. I thought you could use a friend... I guess.”

They sat there in silence after Rei’s heartfelt answer, looking at each other... studying each other. Then, without warning, Number 8 just threw his arms around Rei. It was sudden and rushed, but so needed. Rei hugged him back, fisting the back of his jersey, as tears rolled down both their faces.

They separated in silence, both realizing they might just be in love. With the sound of their hearts beating in tandem, an unspoken connection was blooming within them. As their tears dried, their minds began to wander to where this new relationship could bring them. Would they finally be free of this unexplainable loneliness?

I’ve wanted this for so long. To meet someone like me, I can’t lose my shot. What do I even say? I’ve never met someone so... cute. His gravitational pull is out of this world. I’m kinda jealous, but so... amazed? Is this love? I have to say something, um—

“My name's Rei, by the way.”

“I love that name. I’m Kyuseishu, but cuties like you can call me Kyu.” A flirtatious smile followed the sentence that made Rei’s heart explode.",2,1762341846.0,writers,2,1.0,False

I never thought I had a biological daughter.
Until a tiny genius named Rory marches in with a backpack full of crayons and chaos.
She didn't step in and lifted her chin.
""Excuse me, is Oliver Carter here?""
In the quiet, my name-my previous wrong name?
A hundred calculations tripped over each other in my head and then fell silent, all at once, as the kid's eyes found mine.
""Rock,"" I said automatically. ""I'm Rock.""
I lifted a hand and walked forward, slow, palms open like I was approaching a startled cat. Up close, she had my eyebrows and a mouth.
""What's your name?"" I asked.
She straightened, professional. ""Aurora Garcia.""
I crouched to Rory's level. Up close, the deja vu hit harder. Same eyes. Same ridge in the brow. Same ""don't test me"" mouth. My stomach did an elevator drop.
“Who was your mom?” I asked.
She took a breath like she was about to jump into a pool. ""Alina Garcia.""
The woman 5 years ago!!!
My heartbeat skipped like a scratched record. 
It turns out she is really my daughter.
————————

The clubhouse had two speeds: too loud and police report. We were currently idling between them while my fifteen-year-old sister, Harley Jones, turned the main room into a teen-drama stage and my step-old-man Axel paced like a guard dog who'd just learned about boys.
She hopped off the bar with the grace of a cat plotting murder. As she swanned past Trevor she stage-whispered, ""If I never speak to you again it's only because my father has ten cameras and a shovel."" Trevor nodded like he'd been handed a prophecy.
I thumped the battered piston on the table. ""Vultures-church.""
Doors opened. Brothers drifted in from the garage, the bay, the alley where someone had been teaching a scooter to do crimes. Ghost (chaos with tattoos) shoulder-checked Brute (huge, cheerful, probably bench-presses refrigerators) through the threshold. Diesel (calm, engineer brain) carried a clipboard like a crucifix. Rage (temper like a matchbook) arrived last, bumping fists with Knox, Trigger, and Maverick-serious faces, serious cut marks, serious ability to make bad ideas sound like strategy.
I planted at the head of the long table. The church room was our sanctum: matte walls, old maps, fresh threats, and no witnesses. The door swung shut; the noise of the main room muffled. No women. No kids. No excuses.
""Phones off,"" I said.
Clicks. Thuds. Someone's screen chirped and Rage glared at it like he could intimidate pixels. Silence settled, and with it that live-wire hum that happens when a room full of men decides-to be smart or to be stupid.
""Border's quiet after Friday,"" I started. ""Reapers blinked first. Keep the line polite and iron. Diesel-accounts?""
He slid folders down the table with surgical accuracy. ""Parts supplier paid. The charity ride fund is solvent, unless Brute keeps signing receipts with smiley faces.""
Brute folded his arms. ""Brand consistency.""
""Stop branding legal documents with emoticons,"" Diesel said.
I tapped the piston. ""Security-Ghost?""
Ghost grinned. ""Upgrading cams. Motion. Night vision. Knox and Trigger will handle install. Maverick's got eyes on the alley.""
Maverick nodded once. A man of two words a week. Much like Ghost before Auntie Tash corrupted him with feelings and words.
""And the Tito issue?"" Diesel asked.
""Tito who?"" Ghost said innocently.
""The one selling 'discount' cameras out of a cooler,"" Diesel said.
Ghost shrugged. ""They were cold. Means they run cool.""
""That's not-"" Diesel inhaled like a disappointed dad. ""We'll buy from the catalog.""
""Border,"" Rage cut in, trying to behave and losing. ""Reaper scouts were sniffing the warehouse last night. I had words.""
""Words?"" I said.
""Chose short ones,"" he said. ""Easier to understand.""
Knox smothered a laugh. Trigger didn't bother.
I leaned back, let the room breathe. ""No heat unless I light it. We don't start problems; we end them politely. Copy?""
Nods all around, including a grudging one from Rage, who looked like he slept hugging a complaint.
From outside, a thud, then Harley's voice: ""I WAS LEAVING, DAD."" Axel's rumble answered, then the main door slammed. Good. Church boundary respected.
""Charity ride,"" I said. ""Friday. We do the school supply run, shake hands, smile in photos, pretend we don't bite.""
Ghost raised a hand. ""Can we bite if asked politely?""
""No.""
Brute slouched forward, eager. ""I can do clown wrangler.""
""There are no clowns,"" Diesel said.
""There are always clowns,"" Brute said gravely. ""They just aren't honest about it.""
Trigger cleared his throat. ""PD liaison says they want the route pinned by Wednesday. I'll email.""
""Do it,"" I said. ""Keep the cop who likes us liking us.""
The AC rattled. Someone's chair squeaked like a guilty conscience. The room settled into rhythm: report, quip, decision, move. I thrive here. Authority fits me like the kutte, heavy in a good way.
Then the rhythm wobbled.
A prospect's voice, faint through the wall: ""Uh-Prez?""
I held up a hand for quiet. ""Church.""
""Yes, sir, sorry, sir-just, uh-""
Knox's mouth twitched. Rage rolled his eyes. Diesel stared at the door like he could weld it shut with concentration.
""Later,"" I said.
A beat. The prospect's shoes scuffed away, like a dog who has realized the steak is not for him.
Ghost leaned over to Brute. Whispered, ""Bet he dropped something."" Brute whispered back, ""Bet it was himself."" Rage kicked their chair legs under the table. Both men yelped.
I smacked the piston. ""Focus."" I slid a paper toward Maverick. ""Your buildschedule-""
The ceiling fan hiccuped. Stopped. Started. Stopped again. All eyes went up.
""Ghost?"" I said.
""Wasn't me,"" he lied automatically.
Diesel stood, reached with a rag, tugged the chain. The fan dropped a single dusty screw onto the table like a sad meteor.
""Great,"" Rage muttered. ""Add decapitation to the agenda.""
""No one's getting decapitated,"" I said. ""If a fan takes your head off, you deserved it.""
Brute pointed at the screw. ""Souvenir.""
""No,"" Diesel said. ""Evidence.""
Knox rubbed his jaw, thinking. ""We good on tires for the weekend?""
""Warehouse is stocked,"" Trigger said. ""If Rage stops doing burnouts in the bay.""
Rage slouched deeper. ""I do them respectfully.""
""Respectfully?"" Diesel said. ""On my floor?""
""With cones.""
""That makes it worse.""
I let the bickering run for nine seconds. Then I shut it down with a look I learned from Axel: not angry, disappointed in advance. The room snapped back like a rubber band.
""Last item,"" I said. ""Prospect class is light. We recruit careful."" I scanned the table. Tired faces, familiar scars, men I'd die for who I hoped would never make me prove it. ""No cowboys. No heroes. We build quiet. We stay fed.""
They nodded, solemn now. Here's the thing about slapstick: underneath it there's calculus. The comedy keeps the edges from slicing you every day.
I reached for the gavel.
From the main room came a clatter like a vending machine losing a fight, followed by Diesel's sacred coffee pot screaming its glassy death scream.
Ghost winced. ""That sounded expensive.""
""Church is adjourned,"" I said fast, because I love peace but I love my coffee more. ""Go fix whatever dumb-""
We stood. Chairs scraped. Rage opened the door-
-and froze, shoulders squaring. Not danger. Something stranger.
I stepped up beside him.
The main room lay in the neon-lit mess of our regular sins: flyers scattered, a toppled chair, the vending machine pitched forward on two metal feet with Knox and Trigger rushing to lever it back while Brute reached under to rescue the aforementioned coffee pot like a man pulling a baby from a river.
In the doorway to the outside, the afternoon sun burned in a rectangle.
Inside that light stood a very small girl with a very serious backpack and curls like someone had drawn them on with a pencil and then refused to erase a single loop.
She didn't step in. She put her small hand on the jamb like someone had taught her to be respectful of rooms that weren't hers and lifted her chin.
""Excuse me,"" she said, loud and brave, like a librarian in a hurricane. ""Is Oliver Carter here?""
No one answered. No women or girls in church is the rule; church was over-but the weight of it still hung in the air, that solemn hush that says what you say now might change something forever.
In the quiet, my name-my wrong name-hit harder than any punch.
Harley, somewhere beyond the porch, gasped, ""She's so cute I'm dying."" Axel's instant reply: ""You'll die later.""
A hundred calculations tripped over each other in my head and then fell silent, all at once, as the kid's eyes found mine like they'd been born knowing what they were looking for.
I don't freeze. I don't hesitate. I don't stare.
I did all three.
Nobody breathed. The only sound was the vending machine settling back onto four legs and Brute whispering to the coffee pot, ""You're safe now, little guy.""
The kid in the doorway did not flinch at two dozen grown men in leather staring like they'd never seen a child before. She just adjusted the strap on her tiny backpack and repeated, very politely, ""Is Oliver Carter here?""
My mouth worked once. Habit tried to speak first. ""Only my mom calls me that.""
Her brow furrowed, genuinely interested. ""Interesting boundary. Are you Oliver?""
""Rock,"" I said automatically. ""I'm Rock.""
""Oh,"" she said, relieved. ""Good. Then the probability just went up.""
Rage leaned toward me, sotto voce. ""What the-""
I lifted a hand and walked forward, slow, palms open like I was approaching a startled cat. Up close, she had my eyebrows and a mouth that looked like it was thinking of jokes it wasn't allowed to tell.
""Hey, kid,"" I said. ""You lost?""
She considered. ""Geographically? No. Emotionally? Some.""
Ghost made a muffled aw noise that sounded suspiciously like his soul trying to escape.
""What's your name?"" I asked.
She straightened, professional. ""Aurora Garcia. But everyone calls me Rory. I prefer Rory because it's efficient.""
""Efficient is good,"" I said. My voice came out softer than I meant. ""Who brought you, Rory?""
""I brought me."" She said it like obviously. ""Two buses and a nice lady at the corner store who said this was a 'terrible idea, sweetheart' and then drew me a map anyway.""
Diesel pressed a bottle of water into my hand without looking away from the kid, like we were handling nitroglycerin. Knox drifted to the side window, checking the street. Trigger hovered near the alarm panel. Maverick did what Maverick does: watched, silent, taking impressions like film.
Outside, Harley's whisper-scream leaked through the open front door: ""SHE IS SO SMALL."" Axel's return rumble: ""Stay out of church."" Harley: ""IT'S OVER."" Axel: ""THE RULE IS CONCEPTUAL.""
I crouched to Rory's level. Up close, the deja vu hit harder. Same eyes. Same ridge in the brow. Same ""don't test me"" mouth. My stomach did an elevator drop.
""Okay, Rory,"" I said. ""Where's your mom?""
Her face did not change. ""At home. Although home is currently a fluid situation.""
I glanced at Diesel. He gave me the tiniest nod that meant copy; I'm already on it.
""Is she okay?"" I asked.
A beat. ""Not... optimized."" The word was too big for her mouth; she got it anyway. ""I left her a note. I packed essentials."" She patted the backpack. ""Snacks, money, bus card, a list.""
Ghost, unable not to, lifted a hand like he was in school. ""What kind of snacks.""
""Graham crackers,"" she said. ""And the circle candies that make red tongues.""
""Excellent,"" Ghost said reverently.
I glanced over my shoulder. ""Everyone back it up. Give the lady some air.""
Brothers shuffled backward in a choir of boots and apology, immediately tripping over fundraiser buttons. Brute pinwheeled, caught himself on Rage's shoulder; Rage didn't move, because Rage is made of anger and rebar. Knox snagged Ghost's collar before he pecked the floor. Coffee pot: still alive.
I looked back at the kid. ""You said probability went up when I said Rock. Why's that?""
She unzipped the front pouch of her backpack and produced a folded paper with more highlighter than a finals week binder. She presented it to me like a subpoena.
""I made a probability tree,"" she said. ""Mom said a few names. 'Oliver Carter' was the only one that triangulated with 'school,' 'motorcycle boy,' and 'looks just like him' as per Ms. Toni at the laundromat.""
A cough from somewhere. Laughter brutally suppressed.
I unfolded the paper. It was a map of LA bus lines taped to notebook pages, arrows, scribbles, and three boxes labeled OLIVER CARTER at different corners, each with percentages. Beside Rock someone had drawn a skull and a tiny smiley face with angry eyebrows. My chest did that drop again.
""Who helped you with all this?"" I asked, already knowing the answer.
""Me,"" she said, then amended, honest to a fault, ""and Google.""
""Solid coauthor,"" I said faintly.
Rory leaned past me and squinted at the room like a building inspector. ""This place has bad outlets.""
Diesel clutched his clipboard to his chest like she'd proposed. ""Finally. Someone who sees me.""
Rage crossed his arms. ""Kid's cute. Kid's still a stranger.""
""Right,"" I said, flipping a switch in my head from feelings to procedure. ""Maverick-door. Knox-eyes on the street. Trigger-call Doc. I want a wellness check that doesn't spook her. Diesel-juice box.""
Diesel blinked. ""I don't-""
Harley's arm snaked around the jamb like she was auditioning for a horror movie and deposited a juice box into Diesel's hand without crossing the threshold. She wiggled her fingers at Rory. ""Hi tiny queen."" Axel's arm immediately appeared and yanked Harley back into the sunlight like a fisherman landing a trout.
Rory regarded the juice box, nodded once. ""Acceptable.""
""Mind if we sit?"" I asked.
She gave me an assessing look that was so painfully familiar Brute made a strangled noise and had to cough to cover it. ""We can sit,"" she allowed. ""But I have questions first.""
""Shoot.""
""Why does everyone keep looking at me like I'm a grenade.""
""Because this room is full of idiots who don't know how to handle delicate things,"" I said, and the men nodded solemnly like a congregation admitting sin.
She considered that, then tugged me by the hand-my hand-and led me to the couch. We sat. The couch squeaked. The room stared. The vending machine decided not to vindictively drop again. Progress.
""Okay, Rory,"" I said. ""Ask away.""
She consulted a notebook. ""Are you Oliver Carter.""
""I'm Rock,"" I said. ""Oliver if my mother is mad at me.""
""Do you know my mother.""
""Depends on your mother's name.""
She took a breath like she was about to jump into a pool. ""Alina Garcia.""

A sachet of Equal is somewhere there in the tray ready for coffee/tea service.

I think this doubles as a heart-healthy low-sodium meal. 

You can choose your special meal after you’ve booked your flight. I highly recommend doing this if you have dietary concerns or allergies. Bonus is that you get served first.

1oozvh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Competitive-City725/comments/1oozvh1/the_man_who_waved_at_me_every_night/,The Man Who Waved at Me Every Night,"

I live in a quiet town where nothing ever happens. Or at least, that’s what I used to think.

Last month, I moved into a small apartment on the edge of town — cheap rent, friendly neighbors, and a big window that overlooked the street. I didn’t realize that window would ruin my life.

It started the second night after I moved in. I couldn’t sleep, so I made coffee and stood by the window, watching the fog roll in. That’s when I noticed him.

A man standing across the street. Perfectly still. Staring straight at me.

I froze. Maybe he was just passing by, maybe waiting for someone. But he didn’t move — not even when a car passed between us. The headlights lit up his face for a second, and I saw he was smiling.

And then he **waved.**

A slow, deliberate wave — like he was greeting an old friend.

I stepped back and closed the curtains. My heart was pounding. I told myself it was nothing — maybe some drunk guy or a weirdo. By morning, he was gone.

The next night, he was there again. Same spot. Same smile. Same wave.

I didn’t sleep that night either.

By the third night, I decided to record him. I set up my phone against the window and let it run while I tried to rest. When I checked the video in the morning, my stomach dropped.

He hadn’t just waved.
He had **crossed the street.**

Frame by frame, I watched him step closer, stopping just under my window. He tilted his head upward, staring into the camera. Then… nothing. The video froze for a second before glitching out completely.

The next few nights, I didn’t look outside. I couldn’t. But curiosity eats you alive, you know? On the sixth night, I peeked through the curtains around 2 AM.

He wasn’t across the street anymore.

He was standing **right below my window.**

I shut the curtains and called the police. When they arrived, the street was empty. They found footprints, though — deep ones, pressed into the dirt right below my window.

The officer told me to install a camera outside. I did. For three nights, nothing happened. I started to believe maybe it was over.

Then, on the fourth night, I woke up to the sound of tapping.

It was coming from the window.

Not hard knocks — just light, rhythmic tapping. Like fingernails.

I wanted to scream, but something told me not to make a sound. Slowly, I reached for my phone and opened the camera app to check the live feed from outside.

The man was gone.

But the tapping didn’t stop.

I forced myself to pull the curtain back just an inch — and saw **a pale hand pressed against the glass from the inside.**

I stumbled back, heart hammering, phone slipping from my hand. When I looked again, the window was empty. The tapping had stopped.

I called the police again. They searched every inch of the apartment but found no one. No broken glass. No forced entry.

But the **handprint** was still there.

That night, I packed my things. I didn’t care about the rent deposit — I just wanted out. I slept in my car at a rest stop and drove three towns away the next morning.

I thought I’d escaped.

Until last night.

I was staying at a small roadside motel, trying to get some sleep. Around 2 AM, I woke up thirsty and went to the sink. That’s when I noticed the mirror above it.

In the reflection, through the thin motel curtains, I saw a figure standing outside the window.

He was smiling.

He waved.

And then he lifted something up — a piece of cardboard with words scrawled in red marker:

**“I found you.”**

I screamed and ran out of the room. The manager called the police, but by the time they arrived, the man was gone again.

They checked the cameras. He wasn’t on any of them.

Not one frame.

Now, I’m sitting in a different motel, typing this. Every window is covered. I don’t know who he is or what he wants. But I can feel it — he’s getting closer.

I can hear soft tapping again, even as I write this.

It’s coming from the bathroom mirror.

If you’re reading this, and you live near Crestwood Town, **don’t stand by your window at night.**

Because if he waves at you, it’s already too late.

(FICTIONAL),"I (23 F) live in a small town Colorado and hate socializing at work. Something about talking to my coworkers and customers when I could be finishing up what I’m doing makes me annoyed. Not trying to be rude but personally it just would rather finish work and get out there. 

For context me and 4 other women work at this coffee shop which I will not be saying the name for privacy reasons but it’s pretty common where I live. Not too packed but packed enough that we work too hard to get under payed. 

One day we had a customer that came in that me and my coworkers had never seen before which was unusual because our town was small and at that time we all knew everyone that came in. I thought it was suspicious but I sucked it up and asked him his order. He had a very thick accent and you could tell he didn’t speak English and kept looking over at my coworker (19 F).

I finished taking his order and walked over to my coworker taking her to the back room to talk to her. “Are you ok?” I asked her. After asking my coworker you could tell she had an uncomfortable look on her face. She said that she was ok and that it was nothing but I didn’t believe her.

Later that night I came up with the courage to talk with my coworker in the morning but I instead the man or my coworker didn’t show up at all the next day. She’s been missing for a week now and the man hasn’t come in since her disappearance.

(Repost after deleted)","Not sure what is going on lately, but many of my posts, even if it fits the subreddit does not go through the reddit filters or it just gets deleted by a mod even if I believe it fits the section.

Anyways, just a repost of my experiences:

if anyone else had experienced this, but there was this couple of times I ended up in what seemed like a telepathic chatroom and I intruded in it. There were some people that were surpised, some people that were generally happy. However after I kept on asking for the lottery numbers, on the 2nd time they literally kicked me out.

By this I mean, it was like as they were talking, I started asking, one person said ""It is you again"" and the other person said something like enough of this, and then it was like the connection scattered.

My other experiences with mind reading was, I thought this person an an eatery was a different name, and I was trying to think of her right name. That person then walked by me and said super loud ""Who the heck is (the name I thought of, but not the right name)""

She said it mockingly too.

Another incident I want to mention was that at my old job, the sugar/straw/cup container somehow has the word ""Mind Reading"" across it. It does not relate to my job at all, as we work with guns, drones, aerospace.

While I was there getting coffee, this lady walked by me, and at this time, I was having intrusive thoughts calling her ""Sup lady"" mulitple times. On the last time, my intrusive thought went something like ""Would you respond to me if I called you an old lady?""

She immedately stopped and asked what did I say?

I didn't say anything, it was all in my mind, intrusive thoughts. Then she flashed an evil grin and walked away.

If people can actually mind read on such a level, then I do suppose missing bodies would be found much easier if the culprit is already caught up versus a different method of inputting thoughts first, then just guessing based on the frequency that inputted the thought into your head.

What are your thoughts?

\*\*\*\*\*\*My most recent one, earlier I was just merely thinking about the harry potter series (not searching anything up) and, it never really comes to my mind. Suddenly this youtube suggestion goes up.

Hey everyone!  
My wife (a UX/UI designer) and I built **AIDente**, an AI-powered calorie tracker designed to make food logging simple, fast, and actually pleasant to use.

We both enjoy healthy eating but found that most calorie tracker apps felt **overcomplicated and time-consuming** – too many buttons, ads, and manual steps. So we decided to create something minimal and intuitive.

You can:  
• **Type** something like “salmon 150g, rice 100g”  
• **Speak** using voice input – “coffee 200 ml, toast 40g”  
• Or **take or upload a photo** – the app recognizes it automatically and calculates calories and macros.

AIDente instantly summarizes your day, keeps all data private on your device, and feels smooth to use every time.

The app is **free to download** with optional **subscriptions** for unlimited tracking:  
• Weekly plan – **$1.99/week**  
• Yearly plan – **$19.99/year** (3-day free trial)

I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or feature ideas!

Will try to summarise as best as I can. A bit of back story,I have a history of abuse; I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for a few years and tactics like the silent treatment and stonewalling was a big part of it. My ex used to do this as a form of ‘punishment’ for things he perceived I was doing wrong, without actually telling me what he was upset about. As per, this is now something that really triggers me and it’s not something I can put up with. Since then; I have found an amazing partner and he is amazing, supportive and I’m in the happiest relationship of my life. Me and my best friend have been friends since we were little kids, we are now in our mid 20s. We also live together, myself, her and my partner and we are all friends. We’ve lived together for the past 3 years and things have been fine for the most part. I have noticed however that my best friend has a very nasty habit of having very unpredictable moods. The past few weeks she has been spamming me with instagram posts and TikTok’s, messages telling me about her day etc , hanging out with me, inviting me to go get coffee with her and just generally being very upbeat and lovely to be around. Yesterday, she went silent on me. She has left all my messages on seen and did not speak to me when it was me and her at home. She reluctantly said hi and then when I asked if she was okay, because I could tell her mood was off she rudely responded with ‘yeah: why wouldn’t I be’. Then stormed off to her room. Now, people are 100% allowed to have their moods and feelings, they’re also allowed to be in a bad mood. I feel like it is unfair when she projects like this. She has done this to me before where she refused to speak to me for 2/3 weeks and when I finally drilled her on it she told me it was because I disagreed with her about something? As if I’m not allowed to have my opinions on things. I genuinely don’t know what it could be this time around. I don’t know what I’ve done and don’t know why I deserve this type of treatment. The only thing I can think of is that she’s upset because I knocked on the bathroom door (we have 1 bathroom) in the morning and said I’ll need to use it soon because I have to get ready for work. But…. Surely that doesn’t justify silent treatment. Whatever it is, it’s massively triggering for me and makes me super anxious. I don’t feel like coming home because even seeing her when she’s in that state gives me severe anxiety.",0,1762339681.0,badroommates,0,0.5,False

A cold night, an empty street, and me standing with one suitcase, not sure where to go next. It was not a crime scene, but it felt dramatic enough for me. I had just moved to New York, and everything looked big, loud, and a little scary.

The first few days were rough. I got lost, missed the subway, and spent too much money on coffee. But slowly, I started to notice small good things like someone holding the door, a smile from a stranger, and the city lights that make you forget how tired you are.

One evening, I heard someone speaking my language in a park. We started talking and shared a lot of stories. He told me about Connect’us, something new that will soon launch in New York for expats, newcomers, and travelers like me who come here for the first time and try to find people from their own country. He said this app will make it easier to stay in touch with your community, even when you are far from home.

He even helped me join the free waitlist for it. I was amazed at how technology can now help people connect in a new city instead of just wandering around hoping to meet someone from home.

1oozl2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oozl2q/is_a_gift_still_expected_if_we_couldnt_make_the/,Is a gift still expected if we couldn’t make the engagement party?,"
I’m just looking for some advice on what’s appropriate here because I’m overthinking it and going in circles.

One of my friends recently got engaged. We used to be quite close but over the past year we’ve drifted a little. I moved interstate from Sydney to Queensland around 6 months ago, so I haven’t seen her since. We’ve chatted occasionally, but usually only when I’ve reached out, which I genuinely don’t mind because I understand that life gets busy.

She and her partner had their engagement party recently at his parents place. My fiancé and I are both friends with them and were invited (we all share the same friend group). However, we couldn’t attend because we already had two trips to Sydney booked for weddings on the two weekends following the engagement party. Flying down three weekends in a row would have been too expensive, especially since the invite only came a couple of months beforehand. I explained this and she was totally understanding.

When I told her that we’d be in Sydney for one of those weddings, I said I’d love to catch up for a coffee while I’m there.

Here’s my question:
Are we expected to still give them an engagement card with money even though we didn’t attend the engagement party?

For context, when my partner and I got engaged last year, we didn’t have an engagement party, so there was no gift or money exchanged then, which is absolutely fine. I’m just unsure if the “thing to do” is still to give money even when you don’t attend… on their invitation it did say ‘Your presence and friendship is the best gift we could ask for however we will have a wishing well if you would like to drop a small gift in.’

We’re currently trying to be careful with money (flights + gifts for the two weddings are already a lot), so being able to not give money for the engagement would really help financially. But I don’t want to come across as rude, thoughtless or like we don’t value the friendship.

So I guess:
Is it socially expected to give a gift/money for an engagement party you didn’t attend?
Or is it okay to simply catch up, say congratulations in person, and leave it at that?

I genuinely just want to do the considerate thing without putting unnecessary pressure on ourselves financially. Any advice or perspective would be appreciated!",1,1762339469.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1oozk48,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanowrimo/comments/1oozk48/pep_talk_november_5th_perseverance/,Pep Talk November 5th: Perseverance,"Dear NaNoWriMo Author,

By now you’re probably ready to give up. You’re past that first fine furious rapture when every character and idea is new and entertaining. You’re not yet at the momentous downhill slide to the end, when words and images tumble out of your head sometimes faster than you can get them down on paper. You’re in the middle, a little past the half-way point. The glamour has faded, the magic has gone, your back hurts from all the typing, your family, friends and random email acquaintances have gone from being encouraging or at least accepting to now complaining that they never see you any more—and that even when they do you’re preoccupied and no fun. You don’t know why you started your novel, you no longer remember why you imagined that anyone would want to read it, and you’re pretty sure that even if you finish it it won’t have been worth the time or energy and every time you stop long enough to compare it to the thing that you had in your head when you began—a glittering, brilliant, wonderful novel, in which every word spits fire and burns, a book as good or better than the best book you ever read—it falls so painfully short that you’re pretty sure that it would be a mercy simply to delete the whole thing.



Welcome to the club.



That’s how novels get written.

You write. That’s the hard bit that nobody sees. You write on the good days and you write on the lousy days. Like a shark, you have to keep moving forward or you die. Writing may or may not be your salvation; it might or might not be your destiny. But that does not matter. What matters right now are the words, one after another. Find the next word. Write it down. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.

A dry-stone wall is a lovely thing when you see it bordering a field in the middle of nowhere but becomes more impressive when you realise that it was built without mortar, that the builder needed to choose each interlocking stone and fit it in. Writing is like building a wall. It’s a continual search for the word that will fit in the text, in your mind, on the page. Plot and character and metaphor and style, all these become secondary to the words. The wall-builder erects her wall one rock at a time until she reaches the far end of the field. If she doesn’t build it it won’t be there. So she looks down at her pile of rocks, picks the one that looks like it will best suit her purpose, and puts it in.

The search for the word gets no easier but nobody else is going to write your novel for you.

The last novel I wrote (it was ANANSI BOYS, in case you were wondering) when I got three-quarters of the way through I called my agent. I told her how stupid I felt writing something no-one would ever want to read, how thin the characters were, how pointless the plot. I strongly suggested that I was ready to abandon this book and write something else instead, or perhaps I could abandon the book and take up a new life as a landscape gardener, bank-robber, short-order cook or marine biologist. And instead of sympathising or agreeing with me, or blasting me forward with a wave of enthusiasm—or even arguing with me—she simply said, suspiciously cheerfully, “Oh, you’re at that part of the book, are you?”

I was shocked. “You mean I’ve done this before?”

“You don’t remember?”

“Not really.”

“Oh yes,” she said. “You do this every time you write a novel. But so do all my other clients.”

I didn’t even get to feel unique in my despair.

So I put down the phone and drove down to the coffee house in which I was writing the book, filled my pen and carried on writing.

One word after another.

That’s the only way that novels get written and, short of elves coming in the night and turning your jumbled notes into Chapter Nine, it’s the only way to do it.

So keep on keeping on. Write another word and then another.

Pretty soon you’ll be on the downward slide, and it’s not impossible that soon you’ll be at the end. Good luck…

I hope this is my experience, but do expect this to be removed and banned (which would be ironic as you complain when Kendra does it to you). 

I came across Kendra’s account about a month ago, in the same fashion that I came across this thread - just popped across my feed. My heart instantly broke. Not for Brielle, but for Kendra. 

I can 100% empathize with some of your issues. Crowd funding unnecessarily does bother me too. I think it’s dangerous to compare and judge someone’s need because quite literally where do you stop. How many of you have had a Starbucks or take out coffee drink in the last week while people in Jamaica don’t have roofs over their heads? Obviously extreme, it’s just silly to compare. Gentle encouragements to direct money to a cause you think is in greater need would be one thing, but that is not what I see here. It’s angry, it’s hateful, it’s extreme. 

People claim Kendra is mentally ill. Well heck, I have three kids and if I watched any one of them go through what Brielle has gone through I would be as well. I have never had to lose a child so I cannot fathom what this experience is like. I did lose my service dog in April. He had been retired for years, but prior to his retirement, he felt like an extension of my own body. I was physically ill when he got sick. I watched his body shut down. For me, it was easy. The second he couldn’t eat, I didn’t want him to suffer. For me seeing him alive and suffering felt worse than losing him. I had the choice to humanely take him in and end his suffering. Kendra doesn’t have that choice. I also get vibes that Kendra might fall right wing on the political spectrum and I think a lot of people on the right (not all, don’t get angry) struggle to understand medicine and science. They grasp on to this ideas of miracles through God because they themselves were indoctrinated to believe that probably at a young age. 

I also try to keep my kids’ internet presence to a minimum so I get the concern of exploiting kids. For me though, it’s more like when my kids grow up, will they want all these pictures and videos plastered everywhere? I am not necessarily supporting the posting of Brielle, but I am saying I think it’s going to affect the healthy and well kids who are constantly being exploited by their parents on a daily basis. Who knows, maybe you all are on those forums too. I will say, when I look back to when Brielle was healthier she did seem to enjoy social media. Again, wouldn’t be my choice, but I’m not in their shoes. 

It’s easy to come here and say we don’t hate her we just don’t approve of what she’s doing. I’m just telling you that isn’t what I see. So many of you appear to be so angry. I don’t know if you think Kendra will see this forum and suddenly just listen to what you want, but the idea of that is as delusional as Kendra thinking Brielle could’ve ever been healed the past two months. So what exactly is your goal? To stress out a broken person? To give them moments of sadness and doubt as she loses one of the most precious beings in her life?

Couldn’t be me. Reflection as a whole needs to happen. Sending Kendra so much love because  she needs it. No one should go through what she’s going through. ",0,1762339301.0,OnlineBeggars,12,0.42,False

He wasn’t bad at first! He was hardworking, focused on the job, and thanked us for being great workers. Even bought us coffee three times, and we repaid him with some treats too. He’s also known for having a girlfriend who’s a little too paranoid about him talking to other girls. I thought she was just insecure until I saw head on *why* she is the way she is. He has a terrible habit of flirting with girls. 

A “new girl” arrived in my area (more like dumped), and from day 1, she was *bad* at her job. Constantly talking to guys, ignoring her duties, on her phone. We’ve told him several times to correct and hold her accountable for her laziness but he laughs it off. Come to find out they’ve been heavily flirting and hanging out outside of work…he even hung out with her the whole time his girlfriend was on a vacation outside the country! We confront him about his behavior and he snaps at us back, saying we “don’t see him help her” and that “we’re undermining his authority as a lead. You can leave if you don’t like it.” Ok, sure. Destroy the respect of your strongest workers for some girl who’s unraveling it all? Sure.

His girlfriend is *obviously* not happy, constantly storming down our area to keep tabs on him.

1oozhx6,https://youtu.be/yvt0QoTGzts,4 Very Scary TRUE Late Autumn Backwoods Horror Stories,"# ""Salt Flat"":

I had just finished packing my bag for the holidays when my phone rang. It was Jason, my old college roommate. He sounded relieved, like someone finally exhaling after months underwater.

“Hey, man! I’m on the road,” he said, his voice buzzing with excitement. “Can’t wait to crash at my parents’ place. You heading out soon?”

“Yeah, tomorrow morning,” I said. “Drive safe, though. Roads get sketchy at night.”

We talked for a while—classes, the endless grind of remote exams, what came next. He said he’d stopped for gas in San Marcos, mentioned how empty everything felt since the pandemic. “It’s weird,” he said. “The whole town looks asleep.”

Then his voice shifted a little. “Hold on—this map app just rerouted me. Says to take this side road instead of the highway.”

“You sure that’s smart? Those country roads can get tricky.”

He chuckled. “Relax. Just a shortcut. Smells like oil out here, though. Real strong.”

He kept me on speakerphone. I could hear the steady hum of his engine, the faint echo of tires over gravel. He started rambling about a documentary he’d watched on spirituality, something about hidden energies and what happens when people vanish. “You ever think there’s more to life? Stuff we don’t see?” he asked.

“Sometimes,” I said. “But you should probably keep your eyes on the—”

He cut me off. “Wait… there are lights behind me. Big ones.”

“Another car?”

“Yeah. Maybe a truck.” A pause. “Huh. It’s gone now. Weird.”

I brushed it off. He sent me a selfie—his grin lit by the dashboard, eyes bright despite the darkness outside.

Then his tone changed. “Whoa! Shit—what was that?”

“What happened?”

“I hit something. I’m pulling over—no, I think I crashed. Damn it.”

“Jason? Are you okay?”

“Yeah, I’m fine. Front end’s wrecked though. Windshield’s cracked.” He opened the door; I heard wind rush in. “Middle of nowhere. Signal’s weak but the call’s still up.”

“Call the cops. Or I can call for you—just tell me where you are.”

“Salt Flat Road, near Luling. Hang on, I see my backpack over there.”

Rustling, footsteps. Then: “Hey… is someone out here? There’s a light. Hello?”

My stomach dropped. “Jason, get back in the car.”

He didn’t answer right away. “There’s a guy walking up. Older man, beard, heavy jacket. He’s shining a flashlight.”

“What’s he saying?”

“Something about the road. Hold on.”

I heard muffled voices.

Jason: “Hey, sir, you see the crash?”

The man: “Boy, what happened here? You alone out here?”

“Yeah. Just me.”

“That’s dangerous. Rough folks use these roads. You hurt?”

“No, sir. Just need to call for a tow.”

“Let me take a look.”

Their voices faded for a second. My heart was pounding. Something felt off—like the man’s voice had no warmth, just curiosity.

Jason came back on. “He says he lives nearby, can give me a ride into town.”

“Don’t,” I said quickly. “Jason, stay in the car. I’ll call the police.”

“He seems nice enough.”

“No. It’s too isolated. Please—just wait.”

The man spoke again, his tone sharpened. “Who you talking to, boy?”

“Friend,” Jason said. “He’s just worried.”

“Tell him not to worry. I’ll get you where you need to go.”

Jason’s voice dropped to a whisper. “Okay… maybe you’re right. There’s something wrong with his eyes. They look… cloudy.”

“Get back in the car. Now.”

“I can’t—the door’s jammed. Wait, he’s coming closer. Hey! Back off, man!”

“Jason?”

Scuffling, breathing, a dull thud.

The man’s voice, low: “Easy now. Don’t fight it.”

“Jason!” I shouted.

The line went dead.

I called 911 immediately, told them everything. They said units were being sent, but I couldn’t just sit there. I grabbed my keys and drove. Luling was over an hour away, but I barely felt the distance. All I could hear was Jason’s voice in my head—and that other man’s calm, wrong voice.

The further I drove, the darker it got. No houses, no lights—just endless oil fields, metal pumps creaking in the night. The smell of sulfur hung thick in the air. Locals always said strange people lived out here—drifters, old oil hands, people who never left when the work dried up.

When I turned onto Salt Flat Road, my headlights sliced through fog and trees. Then I saw it—Jason’s car, nose crumpled against a tree, headlights still glowing into the woods.

I stopped. “Jason?” My voice barely left my throat.

No answer.

The driver’s side door hung open, glass scattered like ice. His phone sat on the seat, screen cracked, still warm. His backpack lay a few feet away, ripped open. His laptop, wallet, and charger were spilled into the dirt.

Then I noticed the footprints—two sets. Jason’s, light, sandal marks. The other—boots, deep and heavy—leading into the trees.

I followed the trail. Found his clothes folded neatly by a fallen log—shirt, shorts, even his watch on top, face up, still ticking. A faint dark stain on the fabric. Blood. My stomach turned.

“Jason?” I called again, louder now. Only the wind answered.

Something moved in the trees behind me—a slow, dragging sound. Then a beam of light flashed through the brush, blinding me.

“You the friend?” a voice asked.

It was him—the man. Beard, grime, cracked lips, eyes like fogged glass.

“Where’s Jason?” I demanded.

He smiled faintly. “Boy ran off. Said something was calling him into the woods. Took his clothes off, just walked right in. Crazy thing.”

“That doesn’t make sense,” I said, stepping back. “What did you do to him?”

“Me?” He grinned wider. “Nothing. Tried to help. But these woods... they take people. Old wells, sinkholes. You’d be surprised how many vanish.”

He took a step closer. I saw the bulge in his jacket pocket—a knife handle or tool.

“Stay back,” I warned. “Police are coming.”

He chuckled. “Signal’s bad out here. Might take ‘em a while.”

Every instinct screamed *run*. I bolted to my car, slammed the door just as he lunged. The engine roared and I tore down the road, gravel spitting behind me. In the mirror, he stood there, watching, flashlight beam flickering like a dying eye.

I didn’t stop until I reached the Luling police station. They searched for days—dogs, drones, even drained parts of the old wells. Nothing. No Jason. No man. Just empty fields and stories. Locals said strange things roamed those roads—oil workers gone mad, vagrants, people who saw lights in the fields and followed them into the dark.

It’s been years. Jason’s never been found.

Sometimes, late at night, I dream of that road—his clothes folded in the dirt, his watch still ticking. And I wake up certain that if I ever drove back there, I’d see that same flashlight beam waiting for me at the tree line.

Because out in the dark, not every helping hand means you’re being saved.





# ""For Trenny"":

I still remember the bus ride up to the Great Smoky Mountains that morning. The sun was just starting to rise over Knoxville, and the highway shimmered with mist. My friends and I were laughing about school gossip, teasing each other about who liked who in class. I was sixteen—same as Trenny—and we’d been close since middle school. She sat a few rows ahead, her brown hair tied back, wearing that soft blue sweater she always loved. She looked out the window, smiling at the fog rolling over the hills. It was supposed to be a fun biology field trip—forty students, a handful of teachers, hiking the trails near Clingmans Dome to learn about native plants and wildlife. Nobody imagined anything bad could happen on a day like that.

When we reached the parking lot, the teachers divided us into smaller hiking groups. Trenny and I ended up together, along with a few others, including Robert—a quiet, older student who sometimes gave people rides after school. He wasn’t exactly friendly, just... watchful. The kind of guy who lingered on people with his eyes a second too long.  
“Hey, Trenny,” he said as we started up the path toward Andrews Bald. “You bringing your notes? I might need to borrow them later.”  
She smiled politely, but her voice was distant. “Yeah, sure.” Then she turned back toward me, her face uneasy.

The trail was narrow, lined with dense evergreens and moss-slick rocks. The sound of boots crunching on leaves filled the quiet. Students spread out, stopping now and then to look at plants, snapping photos. A few minutes later, Trenny leaned close to me.  
“Jenny,” she whispered, “does Robert seem off to you today? He keeps staring.”  
I shrugged it off. “He’s always like that. Probably just bored.”  
She nodded, but her fingers tightened around the straps of her backpack.

As we hiked higher, she started talking about weekend plans—about Kelvin, her boyfriend her parents didn’t know about yet. She laughed softly, brushing hair from her face. “He said he’s coming over tonight. I told him I’d call after the trip.” But there was something in her voice, like she was trying to talk herself into feeling normal.

When we reached the bald—a wide, grassy ridge with sweeping views of the Smokies—the air felt thinner, quieter. Everyone sat down for lunch. Trenny wandered off with Robert, settling a little apart from the group. I watched them from a distance. He was talking fast, hands gesturing. Her face looked tense, eyes darting toward the trees. After a while, she stood abruptly, brushed off her jeans, and headed back toward the trail.  
“I’m going ahead,” she said when she passed me. “Catch up later, okay?”  
Her voice was a little too bright, like she was pretending nothing was wrong. I nodded, but something in my gut twisted.

The rest of us finished eating and started back not long after. Robert rejoined the group near the trailhead, moving quietly.  
“Where’s Trenny?” I asked.  
He barely looked up. “She wanted to walk ahead. Needed some air.”  
His tone was casual, but his eyes didn’t meet mine.

As we made our way down, the forest seemed darker than before. The branches arched over the trail, muffling the wind. At one point, I heard rustling off to the side—heavy, deliberate.  
“Did you hear that?” I asked Lisa, the girl beside me.  
She hesitated. “Probably a deer.”  
But it didn’t sound like a deer. It sounded like footsteps, keeping pace just beyond the trees. Robert glanced toward the noise but said nothing, his jaw tight. “Keep moving,” he muttered.

When we finally reached the buses, Trenny wasn’t there. The teachers started counting heads. “Has anyone seen Gibson?” one called out. We all looked around, murmuring.  
“She was ahead of me,” Robert said flatly. “Must’ve taken a wrong turn.”

The teachers searched the area while the rest of us waited, calling her name. “Trenny! Trenny!” But the woods only echoed us back.

Search teams formed, and I joined one. We retraced the trail, shouting until our throats were raw. Near a bend in the path, someone found a crushed beer can and cigarette butts—brands her brother smoked, though he hadn’t come on the trip. It didn’t make sense. “She wouldn’t go off-trail,” I told Lisa. “She knows better than that.”

Robert stayed near the buses, saying he was tired. When someone pressed him, his hands trembled slightly.

By dusk, park rangers had arrived with dogs. The hounds followed her scent down the trail, then veered sharply into the brush toward a small pull-off by the road. And then... nothing. The trail just stopped cold.  
“Maybe someone picked her up,” one ranger whispered to a teacher.  
But who would be waiting for her out there?

That night, back home, I couldn’t sleep. The phone rang late—Trenny’s mother. Her voice cracked when she asked, “Did she say anything to you? Anything about plans?”  
I hesitated, then told her about how nervous Trenny had been, how she’d mentioned Robert acting strange. “They talked alone at lunch,” I said quietly. There was silence on the line, then a soft, “Thank you, sweetheart.”

The days that followed blurred together. Police questioned everyone. Robert’s story kept shifting—first he said they argued about something trivial, then that she walked off angry, then that she seemed fine. They found her hair comb in his car a few days later. “She left it there last week,” he claimed. But no one could remember her ever getting in his car.

Worse, her sapphire ring—the one she never took off—turned up at school, worn by one of Robert’s friends. “Found it on the trail,” she said when asked, but her voice shook.

Calls started coming to Trenny’s house—breathing, then silence. Once, when I called to check on her mom, Robert answered. “I’m helping the family,” he said, voice low. Later, Mrs. Gibson told me she never asked him to.

After that, he started watching me at school. I’d look up in the hallway and catch him staring, expression blank. Sometimes I’d see his car parked near my street after dark. Once, I turned around walking home and thought I saw someone step behind a tree. I ran all the way back, heart pounding.

Months passed. The search was called off. Some said Trenny ran away, maybe with Kelvin. But he was devastated. “She wouldn’t leave without telling me,” he said through tears. I believed him.

Years later, I still dream about that day. About her blue sweater disappearing into the trees. The scent trail ending near the road. The silence after her name stopped echoing back.

Maybe Robert did something—maybe someone else was waiting. Files went missing, reports sealed, leads vanished. His father worked with the park service, had friends in the right places. Too many questions, no answers.

I haven’t gone back to those mountains since. The woods there don’t just hold secrets—they hold people. You can feel it, that stillness in the air, like something watching from between the trees. Sometimes, when the wind shifts just right, I swear I can still hear her laugh carried through the pines—bright, familiar, and cut short too soon.

I’ll never know what really happened to Trenny Gibson. But the fear, the guilt, and that echo… they’ve never left me.





# ""A Quiet Place"":

That November morning, I rose before dawn, breath misting in the cold kitchen light. The woods outside were still black, a low fog hanging over the fields. I was excited—Elmer and I had been planning our deer hunt for weeks, same as we’d done every year since we were young men. Tradition, you could say.

Elmer lived a few miles out, on a stretch of backwoods road that wound through the pines and climbed toward the ridge. His cabin sat on a small clearing, tucked so deep you could drive past it twice before noticing the smoke from his chimney. Usually, Clara would have the stove going by the time I arrived, greeting me with that bright smile and a mug of strong coffee. She always made biscuits too—hot, flaky things that smelled like butter and warmth.

That morning, as I turned down the narrow dirt path toward their place, something felt wrong. The fog was thicker there, and the trees pressed close on either side like they were holding their breath. The first thing I saw was the Cadillac—parked crooked at the edge of the yard, door half open, frost glinting on the windshield. No light in the windows. No smoke. No sound.

I slowed, squinting through the windshield. The stillness was heavy, unnatural. I killed the engine, the silence swallowing the hum instantly. My boots crunched over the leaf litter as I called out, “Elmer? Clara?”

No answer.

I took a few steps closer, heart thudding, and that’s when I noticed the banjo case sitting on the porch steps. It looked out of place—left carelessly, latch open. Elmer would never leave it out like that. He treated his instruments better than most men treat their own children.

The yard was scattered with leaves and early frost, the grass stiff underfoot. Then I saw it—something lying near the big hickory tree, half-hidden by the shadows. At first I thought it was a bundle of clothes, maybe something dropped from the line. But as I got closer, the shape resolved into something terrible.

Clara.

She was face down, her dress twisted, her arms flung out unnaturally. There was blood—dark, sticky, frozen around her hair. For a second, my mind refused to understand what I was seeing. Then the world seemed to narrow, and I dropped to my knees beside her.

“Clara!” I shouted, shaking her shoulder. But she was cold—cold as the earth beneath her. Frost glittered in her hair. There was a hole in the back of her head, small and neat and final.

I staggered back, heart hammering, breath coming in ragged bursts. The woods were so quiet that even the distant crows seemed to hold their calls. Someone had done this—someone close enough to still be watching. I ran to my truck, grabbed my rifle, and moved toward the cabin, every sound in the underbrush making me flinch.

The front door hung open. I pushed it slow, the hinges creaking loud in that awful silence. Inside looked like a storm had passed through—drawers dumped, chairs overturned, papers scattered like snowdrifts. The air smelled of gunpowder and cold ashes.

Then I saw him.

Elmer was on the floor by the fireplace, eyes wide open, mouth slightly parted as if trying to speak. His overalls were soaked in blood. A small pistol lay near his hand, a few spent shells glittering beside it. His old radio was still on, whispering a country tune from the corner, static crackling under the melody.

I froze, unable to move. My best friend—gone.

For a long moment, I just stood there, shaking. Then instinct took over. I stumbled to the wall phone, but the line was dead—the cord cut clean near the baseboard. Later, I’d find the wire slashed outside too.

I turned to leave when I heard a sound from the back room—a rustle, quick and soft. My grip tightened on the rifle.

“Who’s there?” My voice cracked.

Silence.

I inched forward, the boards creaking under my boots. The door to the bedroom was ajar, but when I pushed it open, there was nothing—just the pale curtains stirring from a draft, and the faint smell of gun oil. Still, the feeling didn’t leave me. Someone had been here. Maybe still was.

I backed out slowly, rifle raised, eyes sweeping the tree line. The woods were endless shadows. Every stump looked like someone crouching. Every sound made me jump.

I didn’t wait. I ran for the truck, fired it up, and tore down that road faster than I ever had before.

When I burst through my front door, Betty turned from the stove, startled.  
“Good Lord, Harlan—what happened?”

“Call the sheriff,” I said, gasping. “It’s Elmer and Clara. They’re dead.”

Her face drained of color. “Dead? Are you sure?”

“I saw them. Both of them. Shot.”

Her hands shook as she dialed, voice trembling when she spoke to the dispatcher. I just stood there, pacing, trying to keep the images from my head—the banjo case, the blood, Elmer’s empty stare.

The sheriff and his deputies arrived within the hour, lights cutting through the fog as we drove back. They taped off the yard, cameras flashing as they walked the property. I followed behind, numb. One deputy crouched near the tracks leading away from the cabin.

“Another vehicle’s been here,” he said. “Looks like an old station wagon.”

Elmer’s second car—gone.

Inside, they took photos of everything. The cold ashes. The overturned chair. The pistol by the fire. They found hidden pockets in Elmer’s overalls—cash still there, untouched. Whatever the killers came for, it wasn’t money.

That afternoon, word spread through the county like wildfire. By nightfall, everyone at the diner knew. Folks sat in hushed groups, talking over their coffee.

“Can’t be real,” someone said. “Elmer never hurt nobody.”

“Maybe a robbery gone wrong,” another whispered. “Heard he didn’t trust banks.”

I just sat there, staring at my untouched plate. The chatter around me felt far away, like I was underwater. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

Days passed, each one worse than the last. I couldn’t sleep without seeing Clara in the frost or hearing the faint twang of Elmer’s banjo echoing through the woods.

A week later, the sheriff came by with news—they’d caught them. Two young cousins from a town thirty miles off. Drunk, desperate, looking for cash they’d heard Elmer kept hidden. They broke in while he was out, waited in the dark. When Elmer came home, he must’ve grabbed his pistol. Shots were fired. Clara ran. They chased her down.

At the trial, one of them sat there in shackles, blank-faced, and said, “We didn’t mean to kill nobody. He came at us first.”

The other nodded. “She screamed. I just wanted her to stop.”

The judge gave them life. But no sentence could make the horror fade.

I went back to the cabin one last time before it sold. The place was quiet, stripped of life. The porch sagged, and the banjo case still sat where I’d found it, latch rusted shut. For a moment, I could almost hear Elmer’s laughter, Clara humming in the kitchen, the faint rhythm of music drifting through the pines.

The woods around me were still as ever, hiding their secrets under frost and shadow.

Since that day, I’ve locked my doors at sundown. I keep the rifle by the bed. Because out here, even in the quietest places, evil can walk right up your driveway and smile before it kills you.

And every November morning, when the air smells of frost and old leaves crunch underfoot, I remember that day—the Cadillac askew, the blood, the silence—and wonder how close I came to being the third body in that cabin.





# ""The Devil’s Acre"":

As the pastor of a modest church in Eufaula, Oklahoma, I’d known the Lawson family for several years. Robert Lawson was a tall man in his mid-forties with a quiet, deliberate way about him—one of those men who always seemed to be carrying some private weight. He worked odd jobs around town, fixing fences, patching roofs, never saying much unless spoken to. His wife, Cheryl, was softer, more open—a homemaker with kind eyes and a habit of bringing little Emily to Sunday school early so she could help set out crayons for the other children. Emily was six, bright, always smiling during service like the world hadn’t yet shown her its dark corners.

They lived on the edge of town, where the pavement gave way to gravel and then to fields that slowly thickened into the forests leading toward the eastern hills. I’d driven past their place many times—an old white house with peeling paint and a swing hanging lopsided from a tree branch. I never imagined that one day, that image would come back to me in nightmares.

It began with a phone call on a Tuesday afternoon in early October of 2009. My desk was cluttered with sermon notes when the phone rang.

“Pastor Gary,” a voice said. It was Robert—steady, but there was something in it, something strained. “I need to talk. Can I come by?”

“Of course, Robert,” I said. “Door’s always open.”

He arrived within the hour. The air was cool and gray that day, leaves rustling across the church parking lot as he climbed the steps. His jacket looked worn, his hands shoved deep into the pockets. When he sat down across from me, he kept his eyes low, fixed on the floorboards between us.

“What’s going on?” I asked gently.

He hesitated. When he finally spoke, his voice dropped. “It’s my father. We’ve had trouble for years. Last November he ran me down with his car during an argument—broke my arm.”

I blinked, stunned. “Good Lord, Robert. Did you report it?”

He nodded faintly. “Police came. But nothing stuck. He’s smart—always just on the right side of the law. Now he’s making threats again. Says he’ll come after us—me, Cheryl, even Emily. I think he’s into something bad… meth, maybe. He’s got people behind him. The kind that don’t forget.”

I tried to keep my voice calm. “You need to go to the authorities again.”

“They can’t help,” he said flatly. “I just wanted someone to know. In case something happens.”

We talked for nearly an hour. He spoke of his father’s cruelty, of debts and grudges stretching back decades. He mentioned he’d found a plot of land up near Red Oak, deep in the San Bois Mountains—forty acres of peace, he said. “A fresh start,” were his exact words.

Before he left, we prayed together. His handshake was firm, but his eyes… they carried a look I can still picture—half fear, half resignation, like a man who already knows he’s being followed.

Two days later, Cheryl called me. Her voice trembled. “Pastor, Robert told me he spoke with you. Could I come by? Alone?”

When she arrived, she looked exhausted, her hair hastily tied back, a crumpled tissue clenched in one hand.

“Robert’s worried about his father,” she said quietly. “But it’s more than that. We’ve been getting calls—late at night. No one says anything. Just silence. Last week, someone drove past the house slow… real slow. I keep my handgun close, but…” She trailed off, glancing toward the window.

“Do you think it’s him? His father?” I asked.

“Maybe. Robert says he’s mixed up with dangerous people. We even found a note on our door once—‘Stay out of it.’ No name. No explanation.”

She told me about their plan to move into the mountains—forty acres of isolation and safety. Emily, she said, was thrilled, drawing pictures of cabins and pine trees. When she spoke her daughter’s name, her voice broke. “I just want her safe.”

We prayed together too. She hugged me before leaving. “Thank you, Pastor. You don’t know how much this means.”

That was the last time I saw any of them alive.

A week passed, then two. I noticed their seats empty at Sunday service. The following afternoon, I drove out to their house. Their truck was gone, curtains drawn. The yard looked normal at first—but as I stepped onto the porch, an uneasy stillness hung in the air. Through a window I saw dishes left in the sink, a toy lying on the floor. It felt as though the family had vanished in the middle of life’s routine rhythm.

I called the sheriff the next day. “The Lawsons haven’t been around,” I told Deputy Harris. “Robert said his father was threatening him.”

“We’ll check it out,” he replied.

Days turned into more. Then the rumors began—some said they’d fled the state, others whispered darker things.

On October 17, search parties formed. I joined one, driving into the San Bois Mountains under a low ceiling of clouds. The roads wound like veins through dense, silent woods. Cell service vanished. We split into small groups, calling their names into the trees.

By late afternoon, a hunter radioed in: he’d found their truck on a dirt trail south of Kinta. We hurried there. The white pickup sat half-sunk in mud, door ajar. Inside, their dog Maisie whimpered weakly, ribs showing. Someone handed her water, and she drank like she hadn’t in days.

“Look here,” one searcher said, pointing to the back seat. There were their wallets, IDs, phones—all untouched. Under a blanket lay a thick stack of cash. We counted later—thirty-two thousand dollars.

“Why would they leave that behind?” someone muttered.

No one answered. Cheryl’s handgun was missing, along with a brown briefcase she’d told me held their important papers. The GPS showed they’d driven straight there. Then… nothing.

As dusk fell, I told the deputy I’d scout a nearby trail. “I won’t go far,” I said.

The woods swallowed me almost immediately. Branches clawed at my sleeves. The air was heavy and still, the silence pressing against my ears.

“Robert? Cheryl?” My voice carried but didn’t return.

Then—a snap. A twig, close. I froze.

Another sound—rustling, faint but deliberate, like footsteps shifting just out of sight. My flashlight beam cut through the gloom, catching glimpses of brush, tree trunks, and shadow. Then I saw it: a torn scrap of pink fabric caught on a thornbush. I knew that color. Emily’s jacket.

My hands trembled as I picked it up. “Emily?” I whispered.

The woods didn’t answer. Just another crack—a branch breaking. Closer this time.

I turned in circles, the light shaking wildly. I saw nothing, yet I knew I wasn’t alone. The air changed, grew colder, heavier. My pulse thundered. I backed away, then broke into a run, stumbling back to the group, clutching that pink scrap like a lifeline.

“There’s something out there,” I gasped to the deputy. “Something—or someone—watching.”

Searches went on for weeks. Helicopters circled, dogs combed the ridges, volunteers scoured the hills. I went back several times myself. Once, standing on a ridge at dusk, I thought I saw a tall figure far down the valley, motionless, facing me. When I blinked, it was gone.

Robert’s father denied everything, his alibi thin as paper. Nothing was ever proven.

Four years later, in November 2013, hunters found skeletal remains three miles from where the truck had been. Two adults, one child. DNA confirmed it: the Lawsons. No gunshot wounds. No clear injuries. Just bones scattered by animals and time.

The case was closed as “undetermined.”

But I still wake some nights, heart racing, hearing those phantom footsteps in the dark woods of my mind.

Sometimes, when I drive those mountain roads and the fog drifts through the trees, I swear I see a figure just beyond the pines—tall, still, waiting. Watching.

And I remember Robert’s last words before he left my office.  
“If anything happens, Pastor… promise you’ll remember us.”

I rent an open-air space near the beach and teach four days a week. It’s simple, quiet, and honestly… kind of magical when the ocean breeze hits mid-class. But after all these years, there are still things I really wish I’d known earlier, both good and bad:

The Negatives:

Loneliness sneaks up on you. Even with good friends around, sometimes you just miss that feeling of home.

Internet anxiety is real. Not just bad Wi-Fi, but the need to be constantly online. Between keeping up with family and maintaining a social presence for work, it sometimes feels like you can’t unplug without everything falling apart.

Watching everyone else follow the “normal path” can mess with your head. Friends back home getting married, having kids, buying houses… meanwhile you’re hopping between places with a backpack and a yoga mat. Sometimes it makes you wonder if you made the wrong choice and it’s hard not to spiral down that thought.

The Positives:

Real friendships still happen!! I used to think nomadic life meant constant goodbyes, but I’ve actually made some of my closest friends on the road. One girl I met in a coffee shop noticed I was reading Mistborn, and we ended up traveling together for months.

Your normal expands. Working from random spots, a beach, a mountain hostel, a train station stops feeling weird. It becomes your baseline.

Freedom actually teaches discipline. Without a boss or fixed hours, you realize you have to create your own structure. It’s weirdly empowering.",19,1762338692.0,digitalnomad,6,0.89,False

**TL;DR**

**📊Headline stuff** 

* 12 of the top 25 mids are DMs/CMs right now — **2 of the top 3** are outscoring Mo f\*\*kin Salah.
* But a lot of that is **variance + bonus tied to attacking returns**. 
* When the goals/assists dry up, the bonus does too.
* Versus past seasons, defcons have **slightly** widened the pool, not blown it open.

**Player takeaways 🧪**

**✅ Picks:**

* **Rice (ARS)** – set pieces, bonus, steady minutes; not really a defcon monster but gets there enough.
* **Xhaka (SUN)** – treat him like a 4.5 defender; rotate.
* **Bruno Fernandes (MUN)** – playing CM but still a pick. We’re not arguing about it.  

**🤏 Maybes:**

* **Enzo (CHE)** – underperforming xG; benefits from role/absences. I’m sceptical but could be wrong.
* **Szoboszlai (LIV)** – solid mins, some DC, trickle xGI; fixtures from GW12 help.
* **Palhinha (TOT)** – decent defcons; attacking output likely to regress.
* **Cullen (BUR)** – cheap rotator if you must.  

**🚫 Not picks (for me):**

* **Caicedo (CHE)** – big DC count but only hits threshold \~50%; goals/bonus look like variance.
* **Gravenberch (LIV)** – overperforming; bonus only with returns; shaky defence.
* **Bruno G (NEW)** – overperforming; not giving the defcons you want.
* **Zubimendi (ARS)** – no xG/xA to speak of.
* **Casemiro (MUN)** – minutes are the killer; if he ever starts hitting 90s regularly, revisit.

**🐘The elephant(s) in the room/defence 🛡️**

* If you want cheap points, **defenders have been better value**. 
* 4 or even 5 at the back makes sense.
* Top 25 **DEF**: avg **£5.1m** and **49.3 pts**
* Top 25 **MID**: avg **£6.7m** (≈£6.3m w/out Salah) and **48.2 pts**

**🧾Conclusion**

* The “rise of the DM/CM” is **a bit exaggerated**.
* Defcons help at the margins, but you still want **repeatable attacking output** or **cheap defender value**.

Fire away with questions, comments etc. I’m really keen to test this view.
