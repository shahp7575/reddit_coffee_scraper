1kl5aq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1kl5aq8/new_to_learning_italianhelp/,New to learning Italian—Help!,"I started learning Italian about 12 days ago and I need some help. So far I can read fairly well but I just started so it’s not easy. I guess I just need some advice on strategies and other things to use to help me progress and understand better.

Here’s what I’m currently doing:

I started off with Duolingo and it has helped me a lot with vocabulary and learning words. I am watching YouTube videos by Manu Venditti and his “Beginner Italian Course” with 30 lessons, which has been a tremendous help. I’m listening to the podcast “Coffee Break Italian” and that has also been a good source. And to top it off I am watching an Italian series “Suburra: Blood on Rome” with English subtitles.

Other things I am thinking about:

I have seen an online course, “ItalianPod101.com” and it has video lessons, audio, assignments that are hand-graded and I am wondering if I should stack this on top?

Anything else I should be doing please let me know along with any other advice. Thanks!",1,1747087107.0,italianlearning,0,1.0,False

&nbsp;

Kara clenched her fist as tight as she could, wincing as she felt her muscles burn beneath her scarred skin. She relaxed her hand and frowned, looking over it as if it were foreign to her, missing the approaching footsteps.

“Are you alright?” asked the voice of Alura.

“I’m fine, Alura,” said Kara dismissively, turning her hand to look at the back, watching the way her skin moved as she opened and closed her fist.

“I’m sorry?” Asked Alura, some semblance of offense having been taken at Kara’s words. Kara looked up from the table in the apartment she shared with Nia Nal, meeting eyes with her mother, standing only a few feet away.

“Oh, sorry,” Kara said weakly. “I just… I’m used to you not being… you.”

“I understand,” Alura said. “But I would give anything you hear you call me ‘Mother’ just one more time.”

“Yeah,” Kara said, her voice trailing away as she looked back down at her arm. “Why isn’t it healing?”

“It’s a radiation burn, Kara,” Alura said, taking a step forward and leaning over the table, a hand on Kara’s shoulder. Kara shrugged her off gently.

“No.” Kara pursed her lips and shook her head. “No, that can’t be it. We heal under yellow sun, just like how we get our powers. I know Kal survived stuff like this, I just know it…”

“And yet you’ve spent nearly all of the last five days on the roof of this building, and your hand remains the same.” Alura’s voice firmed slightly, and she quickly noticed Kara’s brows furrowing. “It’s a radiation burn, Kara. Everyone in that lab went on about how it *wasn’t* Kryptonite — whatever that is, specifically, I still do not fully know — but they claimed it was of similar composition. I know what materials are used to build functioning Phantom Zone projectors, Kara. Regardless of whether you think you can outheal the effects of such strong radiation, you were severely burned and were able to survive such an event *because* of this yellow sun.”

“And now I get to live with a mangled arm for the rest of my life,” said Kara, leaning over to rest her head upon Alura’s chest, feeling her mother’s arms wrap around her.

“It could always be worse, my dear,” said Alura, her voice softening into what was nearly a whisper. “It could *always* be worse.”

“Could it?” asked Kara, losing focus as she stared off into nothing. “Overall it’s pretty bad.”

“In what way?”

“Every way,” said Kara. “I… we lose our whole planet, and I get here thinking I can at least protect my cousin, only to find out he died years before I arrived. In the middle of dealing with that, I have the scum of this planet try to steal the only thing I have left of Krypton, and have been repeatedly threatened or stalked by some secret agency. And just when I tried to take a break from it all, down came… Dawnstar…”

“That… winged woman?” Alura failed, or, perhaps, didn’t even try to conceal the venom in her voice as she thought about the woman who’d whisked Kara off to some foreign planet. “I wasn’t able to follow you, when she took you away. In all the time I spent in the Phantom Zone, it was truly the only time I felt true fear.”

“She brought me to Starhaven,” Kara said. “She showed me the destruction there.” Alura’s body stiffened.

“And what did you see?”

“I saw the hand of Krypton descending upon a native population and leaving them crushed beneath it,” said Kara. “I saw the result of our occupation and I was horrified. I cried myself to sleep for weeks.”

“And this… *Starhavenite*, what about her?”

“She’s gorgeous, strong, and… driven by hate… and revenge.” Alura let go of Kara and took a step aside, standing in front of her daughter, her mouth a thin line. “I’ve never met anyone like her, and every day that I’ve been apart from her, I’ve felt it. She changed me, mother. She’s changed me so much, but it’s nothing in comparison to how much she has been changed by us.” There was a moment of silence as Kara searched for sympathy within Alura’s eyes, but she found none.

“Go on. What did this Starhavenite tell you we had done to her?”

“She’s part Worldkiller, mother.” Kara searched now for a reaction within her mother’s face, but Alura remained stoic. A part of Kara knew that she must have been expecting this topic to arise, but her heart sank nonetheless. “It’s bad enough that we used them at all, that they were sent to her planet to quell a native rebellion fighting against the boot of an empire, but we left that technology behind, abandoning every lab in the galaxy to be a scar on the surface of every desolate planet we destroyed… And now because of what our empire did, she’s a walking, flying, breathing war crime. One last laugh from the empire that killed her chance of a good life eons before her birth.”

Kara could feel her face shift to accommodate her anger, and yet somehow Alura remained still, barely flinching.

“That’s all our technology has been good for, hasn’t it?” Kara asked, allowing her eyes to plead with her mother for some form of respite, some reassurance that everything she now thought was wrong. “Genocide. Punishment. Torture. Prolonging death for as long as possible.”

“It seems that this *Starhavenite* has really–”

“By Rao, say her damned name!” Kara said, raising her voice far more than she had intended.

“Would she say mine?”

“If you actually listened to her, maybe she would!”

“But she’s not here, is she, Kara?” Alura said, silencing her daughter for a moment, seeing the tears welling up in Kara’s eyes.

“Why did you start making Worldkillers again?” Kara asked. Alura shut her eyes for a few moments, squeezing her fists, before sitting down in the seat across from Kara.

“Krypton was dying, Kara,” she said. “I had to make a decision for our future. We would return to the stars once more and terraform a suitable planet.”

“So you used a weapon that could destroy entire star systems,” Kara said in a low voice.

“I repurposed a tool that our ancestors misused–”

“They murdered entire populations!” Kara shouted, standing from her seat. “What happened to us… we inflicted upon them first! They’re not tools, they’re murder weapons, and you built more! And Dru-Zod… He got his hands on one.”

“Kara Zor-El!” Alura shouted, standing quickly as she slammed her hands down on the table in front of her, smashing her side into pieces. “I will not have you blaming me for the mad ravings of a woman holding age-old grudges!”

“Then why did you do it?!” Kara demanded. “You had to have known what these things were, you had to! They don’t exist without death — they don’t exist without subjugation.”

“And what has Kryton’s seclusion gotten us, exactly?” Alura asked. “There are three of us left, with a- a half-breed pretending to represent what we were and clones running rampant. It was a desperate time and I had to make the call. Either all of our people die or we find a new home. Dru-Zod and his insurrectionists ruined that chance. The Worldkiller that he stole disappeared into the core of Krypton. We *lost* it.”

Kara’s eyes widened as she took a step back, shaking her head.

“It was you…” said Kara. “Rao’s mercy, you’re the reason…”

Alura cocked her head and took a step forward, anger clear on her face.

“The reason for *what*, Kara?”

“His punishment…” Kara muttered. “The weapon you created destroyed Krypton…”

Alura remained silent, fighting the urge to avert her eyes from her daughter, whose tears streamed down her face.

“Rao, please,” Kara began, shutting her eyes tightly and fighting to keep her voice from completely breaking down. “Rao, I beg for your mercy, as your last remaining devotee, I beg for your punishment to end. I beg for your grace and your love, I beg for your strength, I beg for your forgiveness as my house, under your name, has committed a grave sin incomparable to any other, and never repented. Under their name, I–”

“Kara!”

The world fell silent. Kara’s face seemed empty, her expression showing little more than exhaustion.

“There was no punishment from Rao,” said Alura. “There was no sin committed. I made an amateurish mistake letting word of the terraformer leave the Science Council’s chambers. That is all that it is.”

“I–” Kara tried to speak, yet faltered at her first word, feeling a wave of energy leave her body at once. She could barely keep her eyes open. She stumbled a step back.

“Kara?” Alura asked, her voice rapidly shifting from stern anger to deep concern, as if she hadn’t just admitted to being a contributor to her peoples’ extinction. She wanted to take a step forward, but Kara raised her hand, telling her mother to stop. Not only did Alura obey, but she took multiple steps back, eyes wide as she stared at Kara’s scarified arm, the burned skin flowing with green-ish energy circulating through Kara’s veins and along the seams of her scars.

As she watched her mother back away, with a horrified look on her face, Kara began to feel light-headed, barely able to keep herself upright.

“You…” she said, barely able to muster up the strength to push the word from her tongue. “...did this…”

She hit the ground with a thud.

&nbsp;

Kara awoke slowly, eyes fluttering open to the sunlight cascading over her face. She felt bile rising up in her throat as pain wracked her arm, shutting her eyes tightly to fight the urge to let the very little she ate in the past few days resurface. As it faded slightly, the nausea never fully dissipating, she blinked slowly as she looked around, processing the new layout of her apartment. Laying on the couch, she realized that it had been moved to the west window to catch the final rays of the evening sun.

“You’re up,” said Nia, sitting in the small cushioned seat nearby, knees to her chest as she held a book in her hands. “Alura called and said you weren’t doing well.”

“You’re definitely not looking very good,” Thea’s voice arose from the kitchen, holding a steaming mug in hand, the scent of her coffee drifting across the room.

“I feel even worse,” said Kara, moving to sit up. Thea and Nia both watched her carefully, silently, to observe for any sign of strain. She looked down at her arm, the green glow having dissipated, though as she stared down, able to see within her arm, she frowned at how different it looked from her unaffected side. “Where is she?”

“She told me that she needed to go take a break,” said Nia, placing her book down on the table next to her, beside a glass of water she had been drinking from.

“She’s running away,” said Thea, matter-of-factly. Nia shot Thea a sharp glare.

“She told me that you two got into an argument,” said Nia. “And when you guys started yelling, your arm started glowing and you passed out.” Kara remained silent for a moment. She wasn’t used to the pain quite yet. It hurt when she stretched or used the muscles in her burned arm, but the feeling never went away, even as she sat relaxed.

“How much do we know so far?” Kara asked, looking between Nia and Thea.

“What about?” Nia asked.

“Anything,” Kara replied. “The public, the company, how I can treat this. Anything helps, even if it needs to be a distraction.”

“Well,” Nia began with a sigh. “You’re not looking so good in multiple ways. Public’s not the biggest fan of you, between the protesters now camping outside ARGO and the news running with Tycho’s assertion that you, and I quote, ‘*are bringing dangerous criminals out of the prison dimension to further your own supremacist goals.*’”

Kara scoffed and shook her head, blinking quickly. “What?” she asked, giving Nia a confused look.

“Tycho’s big play right now is to turn public opinion,” Nia continued. “You’ve been here over two years, refuse to be a hero in the traditional sense, keep going on about how Kryptonian technology will save the world, and then you breach the Phantom Zone and bring someone *back*.”

“Which is bullshit, by the way,” Thea chimed in. Nia ignored her.

“He’s positioning himself as someone who stopped you and the Titans from bringing more Kryptonian criminals onto Earth. With a bit of help from some more unsavory sources, he’s had a pretty successful go of it, without you to contest anything. ARGO could release a statement, but the danger of what you guys did shows on your arm. He’s the hero for stopping you — injuries and consequences be damned.”

“America’s only really known the Phantom Zone as a prison. They don’t know the terms or sentences but it’s pretty obviously supposed to be a lifelong thing,” Thea said, setting her coffee down on the counter and leaning back against the marble surface. “We love our prisons here in America. We — well, *people* — don’t exactly like it when prisoners go free. Reintegration and recommitment rates, and all.” Kara frowned. “The first Superman fought and imprisoned a few people in the Phantom Zone. One or two Kryptonians among them, I think. Tycho is making people think that you’re trying to bring some of those people back, regardless of what actually happened.”

“He’s been making the rounds on just about every news station that will take him,” said Nia.

“Which leads me to another thing,” Thea continued. “Your little stalker has disappeared. I don’t know when it happened, but she’s been gone for a few days now. She left a few days after you got hurt.”

“And after I brought Alura back,” said Kara, deflating as she felt back into the couch, sinking into the cushions.

“It’s not all bad, though,” Thea said, walking from the kitchen and sitting on the couch next to Kara. “Shay gave me a call just after Nia asked me to come over, she said she’s close to finding out what, exactly, caused your burn and what could help you treat it. She says it’s not *exactly* Kryptonite as Earth has known it. Since Phantom Zone projectors haven’t been a radioactive issue before, she guessed that something inside was housed in proper containers and stuff, but when Tycho fucked around with the projector, that malfunction screwed its housing and it released its stuff right into you.”

“Don’t say it like that,” Kara said, chuckling. “Is it treatable, though?”

“That’s what she’s working on,” Thea continued, leaning back into the couch as she spoke. Nia stood from her chair and sat on the opposite side of Kara, leaning back alongside them both. “She said that it was all a guess so far. Could be an isotope, could be something else, she just hasn’t figured it out. I’m sure she’ll have it done by, I don’t know, next week.”

“I wish,” Kara said, scoffing. There was a brief moment of silence between the three, each feeling the topic that kept calling out to them.

“So,” Nia said. “What are you going to do about Tycho?” Kara sighed a long sigh and tossed her head over the back of the couch.

“Hope he trips and falls down the stairs from the top of his ridiculous tower.”

“I could arrange that,” said Thea, offhandedly. Kara and Nia looked over to her, the latter more taken aback than the former. “I won’t, but I *could*.”

“He’d probably live, anyway,” said Kara, watching Thea nod in concession. “He’s got all kinds of tech under his skin. He probably got a good look at Kryptonian engineering when we worked on that damned projector.”

“It’s a battle in the court of public opinion,” said Nia. “I don’t have a lot of sway at National City News, they still won’t let me bring stories to them, but people are starting to learn my name. I can get some of your side out there, say the right things to stop Tycho from going unopposed. He wants to provoke you just as much as he always has, let words do the talking.”

“And let him use his full team of lawyers and PR professionals to control the narrative? He’s had a week and a half headstart on top of no opposition during ARGO’s entire existence so far,” Thea said. “A handful of articles written by one person — Kara’s *friend*, mind you — won’t do anything.”

“Doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try,” Nia said.

“No, it doesn’t, but it does mean we can’t put all our bets on a single horse,” Thea said, leaning forward. “I know you don’t *want* me to, but I *can* work for you as more than a business partner and manager.” She looked directly into Kara’s eyes. “I’m with you for as much as it’ll take, for as long as it’ll take. I’ll keep your name clean — though, it’s not like things can get *worse*.”

Kara took another moment to think. She had known about Thea’s escapades, she’d seen her come into work injured, and she knew that she was in a miniature war of attrition with her government stalker. Thea was publicly associated with Kara, if Tycho or anyone else discovered Thea’s actions and brought it forward, it would only spell even more disaster.

“Is corporate espionage really worth it?” Kara asked.

“Only one way to find out,” Thea said.

“I’m covering my ears and closing my eyes for this,” said Nia, physically doing neither.

“Says the snoop who can wander through peoples’ dreams,” said Thea. Nia hid her reaction. “You could offer the same thing with a lot less chance of me being pulverized.”

“I’m sure you can do it,” said Nia, smiling mockingly at Thea.

“If you’ll let me,” Thea said, looking back toward Kara.

“Alright,” she replied. “Fine. We’ll figure this out.”

**A Few Days Ago**

The very moment that Linda shut the door to Alex’s car, the phone in Alex’s pocket began to ring, buzzing incessantly and chiming annoyingly until she took it out and checked the caller’s ID. Upon seeing it, she scanned her surroundings — the curb just outside of Linda’s workplace, a chocolate shop in downtown National City — before taking her earbuds and inserting them before answering the call.

“Blackrock,” she said in a quick greeting as she drove off.

“Report to Oregon Headquarters,” said the voice of her handler, stern as always.

“What for?” she asked.

“You’re being inducted ahead of schedule.”

Alex furrowed her brow. She asked, “Inducted into what?”

“Godwatch,” they said. “It’s got an initiative going into production earlier than scheduled and I managed to make your name look good enough for it. Get to HQ for orientation and induction.”

“On it,” said Alex, catching the chocolate shop Linda worked for in her rearview mirror. “Thank you, sir.”",1,1747086916.0,DCNext,0,1.0,False

1kl55c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1kl55c0/how_shy_guys_usually_show_interest_when_they_like/,How shy guys usually show interest when they like a girl?,"Hi everyone! I’m a 19-year-old girl and I’ve never been in a romantic relationship before. Recently, I’ve developed feelings for a 23-year-old guy who, from what I know, hasn’t had a serious relationship either. That’s not something that bothers me — what matters is that he’s currently single and we’ve grown really close over the past few months.

We met less than four months ago and have bonded a lot since then. We’re both into nerdy stuff, so our conversations are always fun and flow easily. We’ve hung out alone a few times — for coffee, beers, or just walking around — and it’s usually him who initiates the plans. I always say yes, because I genuinely enjoy spending time with him.

He’s sweet, funny, thoughtful, and has opened up to me about personal topics like his family, his job, and his goals. We’re both quite shy, especially when it comes to anything romantic, which makes it hard for me to tell if he might feel something more or if I’m just a trusted friend.

One small thing that made me overthink a bit: one day he took me to this really nice spot by the water, and while we were there he casually mentioned he had also brought another female friend there once. I don’t want to seem jealous — it’s not that — but it made me wonder if I’m just another friend in his eyes.

That said, there have been some moments that feel more intimate. When we say goodbye and no one else is around, we hug for a long time. He’s even rested his chin on my shoulder during those hugs. After nights out, he’ll sometimes message me when he gets home, even if it’s super late. We’ve sat and talked alone on benches, and once when a friend’s boyfriend gave her a flower, he came over and asked me if I’d like one too. I thought it was really sweet. He’s also gently rubbed my back when I was cold during an excursion, helped me climb a muddy hill in the rain, and even helped adjust my arm to make me more comfortable. Small things, but they stuck with me.

So, especially to shy guys out there — how do you act when you like someone but you’re too shy to say it directly? What kinds of things do you do to show it? And what are some subtle signs you might give off that someone like me might not even realize are signals? Reading some examples might make me realize he’s been doing things I hadn’t even considered as signs.

When my brother came along all that tiredness and the headaches vanished. I saw how she was with him, it was almost like I was resented and she was being all happy and loving to my brother as a way to get a dig in at me. 

So as I got older I started acting out, I drank, I smoked, I snuck out, things that most people experimented with at that age. The straw that broke the camels back was I was 16 and I stole my mothers car and me and my friend went to a neighbouring city about an hour away. I didn’t have a license and I can admit now it was a stupid and very dangerous thing to do that in hindsight could have ended badly and I shouldn’t have done but I was a kid acting out for just a shred of attention. 

About a month after that I was told to pack for a trip. They dumped me at a boarding school over 4 hours away that they had enrolled me in without my knowledge and I only came back home during vacations although I elected to stay there for minor ones and the times I did go back they were the furthest from happy you can get. 

My time at that school was miserable, I had no friends as I knew nobody and am really shy and I was bullied my dad tried to send me messages but I ignored them. Even though I knew my mother was the reason I was here he did nothing to find another way around this and even though I resented him less so than my mother I still harboured a lot of anger towards him. 

I finished at that school when I was 18 and I stayed in the city as I didn’t want to speak to my parents, I however did grow really close with my brother and we spoke often pretty much until I came back to my home town. I ended up staying there until recently. 

I also got back in touch with my maternal grandparents. My mother never forgave them as they wanted her to have an abortion and she refused when she got pregnant with me. They were older, they had my mum when they were 40 and didn’t want to deal with a crying baby and they also couldn’t afford it. 

They left and stayed with my dads parents and she never spoke to them again which I think is dramatic. They divorced and my nan especially was lonley and enjoyed the company. She however was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer and had estimated 6-18 months left when I got in contact with her and my grandfather about a year ago and she passed away in January. My parents didn’t even attend her funeral it was just me, my grandfather and some of their friends.

I was left everything but by the end of April I was getting nowhere so i decided to go home to see if I could speed the process up as my mother was next of kin and also handler of the will so I thought maybe they were trying to get something out of it which was the reason I wasn’t getting anywhere.

It was the first time my parents had seen me in over 10 years and they tried to smother me saying how much they missed me and all that stuff. I was told I was being hurtful showing up after so long just wanting money. 

I met up with my brother and i decided to stay for a few weeks to try to build some sort of relationship with my parents again as he asked me to and I agreed to try and I’m staying in my parents spare bedroom for now. 

Things have been going okay-ish me and my dad are getting along fine and me and my mum are amicable. My grandad lives fairly close so I met up with him for coffee and my mum threw a fit when she saw him about how I wouldn’t be here if he had it his way and I was a deceitful brat for bringing him around and she would be dead before he step foot in her house again.

The thing is this is opening my eyes to why I don’t thing me and my mum specifically could ever have a good relationship because I can’t do right for doing wrong, nothing is good enough and whatever I do there’s something wrong with it. 

Growing up I blamed myself for being too difficult and thinking I should share the blame for our strained relationship. I genuinely thought she would try to change but I just think she is incapable. 

My nan and grandad were the only ones from me leaving school to now who treat me normal and I’m not going to give that up for my mother who shipped me off without a care in the world without trying alternative methods.  

I’m still going to try for my brother and my dad as we are getting on well but I’m not holding out hope for my relationship with my mum and I’m now remembering why I severed ties with them.

I notice that I experience some weird neck pains, noticeably around my lymph nodes in the neck when getting towards the end of my fasting window (most days fasting 16 hrs, sometimes up to 24 hrs) . It’s not everyday. I found that coffee was a trigger to it so I stopped caffeine intake in the morning and that has seemed to help. 

I’m honestly a bit worried it may be increased cortisol levels. Like I said some days it feels like my neck is inflamed I guess? And other days I feel totally fine. Some days I do have a mental battle with not consuming food before my feeding window arrives. 

Anyone have similar experiences? Maybe dealing with hormones? I’m 27F if that makes any difference. No regular periods so I can’t really follow “fast like a girl” super well. ",1,1747086450.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

We traveled with Africa Inscribed and focused on the Northern Serengeti Circuit. Even though we missed the migration herds by about two weeks, the experience was incredible and wildlife viewing was still excellent.

https://preview.redd.it/2el4vk2c8f0f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa6f91efca40a9a00abbc40267b2e8de9bc8b9a

**What is the Great Migration?**  
The Great Migration is the largest overland wildlife migration in the world. Over 1.5 million wildebeest, along with hundreds of thousands of zebra and antelope, move in a loop through Tanzania’s Serengeti and Kenya’s Maasai Mara, following rainfall in search of fresh grazing.

https://preview.redd.it/ntuctejd8f0f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1db5c7f3addfe682bdfb2e9a008b4924f0a31852

**Seasonal Migration Highlights (Approximate Timing):**

* January–March: Calving season in the Southern Serengeti; lush and filled with newborns and predators.
* April–May: Long rains; herds move north, but this period is less ideal for travel.
* June–July: Herds gather near the Grumeti River in the Western Corridor.
* July–August: Mara River crossings as herds head into the Maasai Mara (very dramatic, but also very crowded).
* October–November: Herds remain in Kenya, grazing.
* December: Movement begins southward back to the Serengeti.

**Best Time to Visit Tanzania for the Migration:**  
Mid-December through early July offers fantastic game viewing without the peak-season crowds of July and August.

**Hot Air Balloon Safari Over the Serengeti**  
One of the most memorable parts of the trip was the sunrise hot air balloon ride. The day started with a 4:30 AM pickup and a long, muddy drive due to unseasonal rains. Once in the air, though, the views were breathtaking. Wildlife sightings from above included wildebeest, zebra, gazelle, hyenas, and even a pride of lions. The flight ended with a champagne toast in the bush—a classic safari tradition and a highlight of the trip.

**Where We Stayed + Lodging Tips**

**Arrival into Tanzania:**  
We flew into Kilimanjaro International Airport (JRO) and transferred to Arusha by private vehicle.

**In Arusha (Pre-Safari Stop):**

*Legendary Lodge – Top Pick*

* Located on a working coffee plantation at the base of Mount Meru
* Spacious garden cottages with king beds, air conditioning, and serene gardens
* Ideal for families and recovering from jet lag; nature walks and cycling available

*Arusha Coffee Lodge*

* Set on another coffee estate just outside the city
* Comfortable suites with fireplaces and air conditioning
* Great African-inspired dining at The Bistro
* Best for couples or solo travelers due to fewer family-friendly room options
* Onsite shop and adjacent to Shanga, a workshop employing artisans with disabilities

**In the Serengeti:**

*Wilderness Usawa Mobile Tented Camp*

* Seasonal luxury mobile camp that follows the migration (locations include Kusini, Moru, Lamai)
* Safari-style tents with ensuite bathrooms, hot bucket showers, and fans (no A/C)
* Excellent meals, walking safaris, stargazing, and a remote, intimate feel
* Great for travelers looking for a more adventurous but still comfortable experience
* Children 6+ welcome

*&Beyond Grumeti Serengeti River Lodge*

* Located on the Grumeti River in the western Serengeti
* Huge suites with plunge pools and panoramic river views
* Fans only (no A/C), so consider weather when planning
* Offers yoga, spa treatments, a small gym, and lovely communal areas
* Food quality varied during our stay, but staff and setting were exceptional
* Pro tip: Ask for a sundowner on the nearby hilltop for outstanding views

**Additional Lodges Worth Considering (not visited this trip):**

* *Singita Sabora Tented Camp*: High-end and immersive, with top-notch service and design
* *Little Chem Chem*: Known for privacy, excellent guiding, and strong conservation values

https://preview.redd.it/i8ee059j8f0f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=88a7583c46bf316b29bc9f0c847e3cc115468242

Even without the herds in motion, the Northern Serengeti delivers world-class safari experiences. We saw lions, elephants, giraffes, hyenas, buffalo, and more—without the crowds of peak migration season. If you’re aiming to catch the migration, flexibility is key. The timing shifts annually depending on rainfall, so working with experienced safari planners helps tremendously.

As the title suggests, I am looking for white/ neutral white paints to go with orange-looking oak hardwood floors. Currently the room is painted with PPG Botany Beige/ a color closest to SW Aged White. I find this to be very dull & too beige & looking to brighten up w/o it being too stark white. 

These rooms are south & south west facing & get a lot of light & sun during the day. I have shortlisted a few based on past posts here but not too convinced with how they look on chips & peel n stick samples. 

Any suggestions from those with similar color floors would be very helpful. Assume: decor will be neutral too. 

The ones I have looked at are:

BM: Alabaster, Simply White, White Dove
Behr: Swiss Coffee, Smoky White (LIKE THIS THE MOST SO FAR)

6. Why do I feel like I’m disarming a nuclear bomb every time I try to open my mobile wallet app at checkout? Worse still when I have over 10 cards!
7. Why am I earning ""points"" from my loyalty cards that expire faster than a TikTok trend?
8. Why can’t I just pay with a fist bump instead of performing an elaborate tap-dance routine with my phone and card?

Hello all. As the title suggests, I am looking for white/ neutral white paints to go with orange-looking oak hardwood floors. Currently the room is painted with PPG Botany Beige/ a color closest to SW Aged White. I find this to be very dull & too beige & looking to brighten up w/o it being too stark white. 

These rooms are south & south west facing & get a lot of light & sun during the day. I have shortlisted a few based on past posts here but not too convinced with how they look on chips & peel n stick samples. 

Any suggestions from those with similar color floors would be very helpful. Assume: decor will be neutral too. 

The ones I have looked at are: 

SW: Alabaster, Snow Bound, White Flour, Greek Villa, Drift of Mist
BM: Alabaster, Simply White, White Dove
Behr: Swiss Coffee, Smoky White (LIKE THIS THE MOST SO FAR)

For back story, him and I talked for about three months before he went on his mission but then I ended up ghosting him because he was going on his mission and I didn’t really want to be involved with that.

About halfway through his mission he reached out to me via Facebook messenger and we began to talk. He would call me on p day and we’d talk for hours and hours. Eventually he said he wanted to be exclusive so we could date when he got home. I was apprehensive but really liked him so agreed. He talked about marrying me and having kids and discussed a future which I took as a good sign.

Upon his returning home he asked me to be his girlfriend and I agreed. Henceforth we hung out a great deal and were getting along super well.

He is going to play college football states away so we discussed doing long distance and he agreed to that as well I would come visit him he would see me when he was allowed to come home etc.

During his mission when we were speaking he made it a point that he didn’t want to keep breaking the rules to speak to me if it wasn’t going anywhere. When we came home we had s*x, he never wore his garments around me, and he would miss church events to hang out with me.

He told me last week he doesn’t think long distance is going to work because of the distance and if he were staying closer he would continue to date me (even tho we basically did long distance when he was on his mission).

I’m confused if this breakup has anything to do with his faith or if he just wants to mess around when he gets to school. His parents are very involved in the church (snd he kinda idolizes them) and so is he but he breaks a lot of these fundamental rules so I’m just SUPER confused because why won’t he drink coffee but he will have sex and cuss and all this other stuff that’s prohibited.",1,1747086053.0,mormon,3,1.0,False

***INT. SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT***

The dimly lit security office is a cacophony of anxiety and dread. A **SECURITY GUARD**, mid-thirties and disheveled, hunches over a small desk, frantically unscrewing the metal vent cover above him. The door, barricaded with heavy furniture, shudders violently as a menacing force pounds against it, the thuds echoing like thunder.

*BANG! BANG! BANG!*

The gaurd turns over to his shoulder, letting out a small gasp. With a final twist, the vent cover gives way. The guard scrambles into the narrow shaft, his heart racing, breath hitching in his throat. He crawls desperately, the air thick and stifling, the darkness pressing in around him.

***INT. STORAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER***

He tumbles out of the vent into a cluttered storage room. Shadows dance in the corners as the muffled thrum of pop music seeps through the walls, a jarring contrast to the chaos he just fled. The guard glances back, eyes wide with panic, before sprinting down the dim hallway, his footsteps echoing like a heartbeat. As he races, the camera lingers on a door, where the ominous silhouette of an **ANTHROPOMORPHIC FOX** flickers momentarily-a predator lying in wait. The guard reached the hallway corner in seconds. He rounded it, and his gaze locked on the glowing red *EXIT* sign above the door just thirty feet away. Pumped up by hope, Bob shot toward the door. The guard hit the door’s metal crash bar at top speed. Fully expecting to catapult through the door into the sweet freedom of the night outside, but the door remained close. He couldn’t bash it open. The guard tried again and again, but froze when he heard it.

*""Da dum dum dum da dum dum dum da dum dum dum diddley dum...""*

The haunting shanty, cheerful yet eerie, echoed throughout the hallway, tugging at the guard's fraying nerves. The guard turned and looked down the long hallway behind him. As soon as he did, the corridor’s lights went out. What little illumination there’d been turned to utter blackness.

*“Dum da dum dum…”*

The humming crept closer. Turning, the guard pounded on the door.

Suddenly, a mechanical growl erupts behind him. The guard spins around, dread flooding his senses, as a shadow lunges from the darkness. The gaurd *SCREAMS!*

**BLACKOUT**

***INT. ANIMATRONIC MAINTENANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS***

With a jolt, the guard wakes up, bound tightly to a cold metal chair. The guard thrashed in the chair. Using all of the strength he could muster, he tried to free himself. The chair held on to him. Panic floods his features as he realizes he's strapped down, a massive, furry grotesque **ANIMATRONIC BROWN BEAR MASK** looming menacingly above him. The mask, a twisted caricature of a joyful face, is lined with glinting blades and sinister mechanical parts, all poised to tear into flesh.

Its glowing red pupils narrow as they fixate on the guard, the whirring of blades echoing like a death knell.

*WHIRRRRR...*

He struggles against his restraints, adrenaline surging as he fights for his life. For a fleeting moment, the relentless grip of despair eases, but it's short-lived. The mask descends, its blades slicing into his jaw, sending pain spiraling through his body.

Overwhelmed by the ferocious onslaught of cuts that claw at his forehead, cheeks, and jab into his eyes and mouth, the guard's spirit crumbles. A chilling realization sinks in: escape is impossible. Survival is a fading dream.

***CUT TO: INT. PIZZERIA - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS***

The vibrant chaos of the pizzeria springs to life. Colorful spotlights spin and flicker, illuminating the room filled with animated decorations.

Offscreen, the guard's screams echo hauntingly, piercing through the cheerful façade.

***TEXT ON SCREEN:***

*UNIVERSAL PICTURES*

*BLUMHOUSE STUDIOS*

*SCOTT GAMES PRODUCTION*

The camera glides through the room, revealing cheerful drawings of children holding hands with a yellow rabbit, the innocence starkly juxtaposed against the unfolding terror.

The scene transitions into an 8-bit animation, depicting the yellow rabbit-an eerie mascot luring five children away from the main stage, one by one, with a sinister charm that hints at the dark intentions lurking beneath the surface.

**LOGO:** *FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY’S*

***INT. MIKE’S ROOM - MORNING***

A shrill beeping slices through the lingering, filmy haze of sleep, invading the tranquility of the morning. **MIKE** blinks awake, his mind struggling to emerge from the depths of his dreams. He groans, attempting to cling to the last remnants of buoyancy that sleep offered him. The beeping intensifies, sharp and insistent, pulling him further into the waking world.

With a reluctant swing of his left hand, Mike slaps at the cheap plastic digital alarm clock, silencing the obnoxious sound. He groans again, rubbing his temples, feeling the weight of the world press against his skull. As he sits up, a sharp, jagged pain shoots through his head, like glass piercing his thoughts. He instinctively clutches at his temples, trying to ward off the throbbing sensation.

With a swift motion, he shoves a pill bottle beneath his mattress, its presence barely contained just inches from the edge. Gritting his teeth against the escalating pain, he leans over, retrieves his *DREAM THEORY* paperback, and places it next to the cassette player. He presses the *REWIND* button, and the machine whirs to life, filling the room with a whispery sound that calms him, if only for a moment.

Taking a deep breath, Mike rises, placing his feet on the frayed edge of his rag rug. He stretches his arms overhead, willing himself to ignore the persistent throb in his head. Dropping to the floor, he begins to do push-ups, the repetitions blurring into one another as he loses himself in the rhythm, not counting, just moving.

***INT. ABBY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS***

**ABBY** is huddled over her drawing pad, her tongue peeking out between her teeth in concentration. She meticulously drags her pencil across the page, crafting a long, sweeping curve. Through the entrance of her makeshift hidey-tent, she catches a glimpse of sunlight streaming in, illuminating the wall opposite her—a canvas of her creativity, filled with colorful drawings.

Although most of her creations are simple stick figures, some show the promise of more intricate forms; she’s improving with every stroke. The soft, dim confines of her tent offer a comforting cocoon, allowing her imagination to flourish.

Suddenly, a sharp knock interrupts her concentration, rattling the flimsy wood door.

**MIKE (O.S.):**

*Abs, you ready?*

Mike enters, scanning the room. His eyes flicker over to Abby’s bed before settling on the crack in the blanket that forms her hidey-tent. With an exasperated sigh, he strides toward her makeshift sanctuary.

**MIKE:**

*Abs, I know you’re in there. Let’s go.*

Abby, eyes squeezed shut, hears the familiar rustle of movement as the blanket flaps part slightly. Mike lets out another long sigh, shaking the sides of the tent impatiently.

**MIKE:**

*Abby, come on!*

**ABBY:**

*Okay, okay!*

Abby pokes her head out, glaring at Mike with defiance.

**ABBY:**

*You’re being a jerk.*

**MIKE:**

*You know I have somewhere to be.*

He lightly kicks the side of the blanket tent, urgency creeping into his tone.

**MIKE:**

*Five minutes. I need you dressed.*

Turning on his heel, Mike heads toward the door, his back to her. In a flash of frustration, Abby tosses her plush dolphin, Dolph, through the opening of the tent. Dolph sails through the air, landing squarely in the middle of Mike’s back with a soft thud before falling onto the braided rug.

Mike turns, eyebrows raised in surprise.

**MIKE:**

*Five minutes.*

With that, he exits, leaving Abby to prepare in her sanctuary.

***INT. MALL - FLASHBACK, DAY***

The food court buzzes with the casual hum of conversations, the clatter of trays, and the distant drone of mall chatter. Sunlight streams in through the skylights, casting warm, geometric patches of light across the polished tile floor. **JEREMIAH**, Mike’s co-worker, slouches at a plastic blue table, taking a long, exaggerated slurp from an oversized cola cup. The straw squeaks as he drains the last of the soda, his eyes flicking up toward Mike before he raises a worn paperback book in his hand, shaking it with amusement.

**JEREMIAH:**

*“And though the dreamer remains asleep, he walks through memory as if experiencing it for the first time, anew. No longer a passenger, but an ACTIVE PARTICIPANT.”*

His voice holds a theatrical edge, as if mocking the book’s words. The pause hangs in the air, but Mike knows better than to answer—Jeremiah’s question isn’t really seeking a response.

Jeremiah snaps the book shut with a crisp sound, glancing down at its light blue cover. The abstract image of a closed eye stares back at him, and above it, the title Dream Theory stretches in a wavering, dream-like font, as though the letters themselves are drifting into slumber. He chuckles, a low, disbelieving laugh.

**JEREMIAH:**

*This stuff for real?*

Mike barely shrugs, his eyes distant, as if the conversation is a dream itself.

**MIKE:**

*Some people think so. Depends on what you believe.*

Jeremiah leans back in his chair, shaking his head with a nostalgic grin.

**JEREMIAH:**

*Summer of ’82… I traded a mint condition Cal Ripken Jr. rookie for a used copy of “Missile Command.”*

He scoffs, shaking his head

*That card’s probably worth 800 bucks now. Man, I wish I could go back and participate in that memory—actively kick my own ass.*

He taps the cover of the book with his fingers, the moment of wistful humor fading slightly as he turns his gaze back to Mike.

**JEREMIAH:**

*Can I keep it?*

Without missing a beat, Mike reaches out, his hand wrapping around the book before Jeremiah can react. He pulls it back firmly.

**MIKE:**

*No.*

Jeremiah watches as the book slips from his grip, a look of mock defeat crossing his face. The moment lingers for a beat before they both return to the idle sounds of the mall around them.

**Yellow Rabbit:** Wake up, children. I have something for you to play with. This is gonna be so much fun. Little ones tell me you have a sister. She will love it here. You, however, are finished. (wipes knife as he says this) Farewell, Michael Schmidt.

**Vanessa Afton:** That's enough! Drop the knife. (holds out her gun pointing at the costumed man)

Currently the room is painted with PPG Botany Beige/ a color closest to SW Aged White. I find this to be very dull & too beige & looking to brighten up w/o it being too stark white. 

These rooms are south & south west facing & get a lot of light & sun during the day. I have shortlisted a few based on past posts here but not too convinced with how they look on chips & peel n stick samples. 

Any suggestions from those with similar color floors would be very helpful. Assume: decor will be neutral too.

*Hi everyone, I’m* ***Mu****, a founder frustrated with slow SEO results. Over the past few months I built* ***TrafLink*** *– a simple link-building service – to solve a problem I kept hitting: getting high-quality backlinks without scams or guesswork.*

**The SEO Grind:**  
I started by scraping Google for my own site’s rankings and spending 10+ hours a week on link outreach – cold emails, forums, broken-link checks. It was exhausting, and I still wasn’t seeing better traffic. I thought, *“There has to be a better way.”* I sketched a quick prototype to organize and vet backlink targets automatically.

**Late Nights & MVP:**  
Those long evenings and weekends paid off: the first version of TrafLink was messy but functional. It crawled domain authority, checked for spam signals, and let me pick relevant sites to contact. I turned my dining table into a dev hub (coffee cups everywhere, I’m sure many of you know the drill). I built just enough to test the core idea: a founder-friendly dashboard to manage link campaigns.

**Validation & Early Traction:**  
I shared the MVP with a few blogger friends and indie hackers. One said, *“Finally, something like this!”* and signed up. Seeing that first account invite felt huge. I set up a simple landing page (traflink.com) and opened a waiting list. Within two weeks, **over 50 founders and marketers** signed up for early access. A couple even became paid beta users right away. These early signups (and their feedback) showed me TrafLink was solving a real pain.

**What TrafLink Does:**  
In short, TrafLink takes the guesswork out of link-building. It curates **high-quality, pre-vetted backlink opportunities** in your niche (no spammy shortcuts). You get a dashboard showing trustworthy sites that match your field, metrics to track your outreach, and proven campaign templates. In beta testing, users have already seen small but steady bumps in their site traffic and rankings.

**What I Learned:**

* **Solve your own problem first.** TrafLink grew out of my own SEO struggles; this authenticity made it easier to explain and refine.
* **Your first version can be ugly.** The early MVP was clunky, but it let real users test the concept. Fix the UX later – first get feedback.
* **One paying customer changes everything.** Getting even a couple of users invested in TrafLink boosted my confidence and helped fund the next sprint.

I’m excited to keep improving TrafLink and help indie founders grow their traffic. Right now I’m focused on reaching the next milestone: **landing 100 happy customers** and covering our own costs. If you work on SEO or blog growth, I’d love your feedback – I’m planning more outreach campaigns and could even share a promo code for early adopters.

He asked around if I was into guys, got my number. He sent me a text, we arranged for coffee/walking around his neighborhood the other weekend, which we do. He then invites me over to his place. We chit-chat while Netflix plays. We start making out heavily and he takes me to his room.

Problem was that I knew since the minute I stepped out of my house that that was not a good day for my libido. I've been struggling hard with my sex drive since starting sleeping meds for my shitty sleep. It comes and goes, but goes for like 2-3 weeks, and this week was one of those.

I was probably a nervous mess, because I was hyperfocused on how I knew I wouldn't perform. He was rock-hard all throughout. I sucked and jerked him off, he came, and we went back to the couch, and chatted a while longer. I opened up to him about my libido issues, he seemed understanding and we kept on chatting. I was probably still a nervous (and now embarrassed) mess. A while later he asked me to leave (I had told him he could kick me out whenever, since I knew he's an early sleeper).

Two days later, I text him and tell him I had fun Saturday, but that I wasn't in a headspace for sex, but that I'd be up for another round another time, and that he has quite the ass, to which he replies ""I'm not much of a bottom, but that day I would've bottomed. But that has passed"". I follow up with ""Got it. My bad if something bothered you"". Finally, he says ""nothing at all. But I'm not feeling it anymore.""

1kl4je2,https://i.redd.it/dxwoz36b5f0f1.jpeg,Artistly AI – Your New T-Shirt Design Powerhouse (20% Discount Inside!),"If you're in the competitive world of print-on-demand (POD) T-shirts, you know that fresh, captivating designs are everything. But constantly churning out unique ideas can be a real grind. That's where Artistly AI steps in, and it’s rapidly becoming an indispensable tool for T-shirt creators looking to innovate and scale.

Why Artistly AI is a Game-Changer for T-Shirt Designers:
Blast Through Creative Blocks:
Stuck for ideas? Simply feed Artistly AI a concept – ""a retro robot drinking coffee,"" ""a minimalist mountain range silhouette for hikers,"" or ""a cute kawaii cat playing a ukulele"" – and watch it generate a variety of visual interpretations in seconds. This is incredibly powerful for brainstorming and exploring different niches.

Versatile Style Generation:
Whether your brand is edgy, whimsical, vintage, futuristic, or text-based, Artistly AI can adapt. By crafting specific prompts, you can guide the AI to produce graphics that align perfectly with your desired T-shirt aesthetic, from detailed illustrations to clean, iconic symbols.

True Originality in a Crowded Market:
The beauty of AI-generated art is its inherent uniqueness. This helps your T-shirts stand out from the flood of generic stock designs, giving your brand a distinct edge and a higher perceived value.

High-Quality, Adaptable Outputs:
Artistly AI generally produces high-resolution images that can be suitable for T-shirt printing. Many designs come out clean and crisp. For best results, especially with intricate details or specific text placement, you might export the AI-generated base and then fine-tune it in a program like Canva or Adobe Illustrator. The platform often offers upscaling options too.

Commercial Use Clarity:
One of the biggest hurdles for POD sellers is image licensing. Artistly AI (according to their standard terms, which you should always verify) typically grants commercial usage rights for the designs you create. This means you can confidently sell T-shirts featuring your AI-generated artwork without worrying about complex licensing fees.

Tips for T-Shirt Success with Artistly AI:
Master Your Prompts: The more detailed and descriptive your prompt, the better the AI can translate your vision. Experiment with keywords related to style, mood, color palettes, and composition. For example, adding ""vector art style, clean lines, isolated on white background"" can make a big difference for T-shirt readiness.

Text as a Separate Layer: While AI can generate text, for maximum control over font, placement, and legibility on a T-shirt, it's often best to generate the main graphic in Artistly AI and then add your text using a dedicated design tool.

Iterate and Refine: Don't expect the first generation to always be perfect. Use the AI's output as a strong starting point and be prepared to iterate on your prompt or do minor touch-ups.

Last Saturday I took my 3 hour,  It didn't seem too bad. Just bored out of my mind and watching Netflix in the waiting room. I felt all fine and dandy even though they kept missing veins each hour.

On my way home I felt horrible sweats everywhere, and I mean everywhere. I was a bit dizzy and just thought man I could use some coffee... I barely get in the door because I feel like I'm going to pass out. My husband hands me an empanada and a piece of candy and some water. I'm on fire, still sweating with a ice pack on my feet and I pass out in the chair.. 

Fast forward to today - I see my test results  come in with no notes, they're all over and confusing .. 2hour 133mg ....1hour 34mg..??!  Thankfully the nurse rang right away. She asks in a rush for me and it's double checking that I'm okay. She said I had really bad hypoglycemia, My results came back listed as ""PANIC"" from the lab and is surprised I made it home by myself. 🫠🙃

Word is spreading across the digital realms – a new dawn of discovery is upon us! Here at the Embark D&D workshop, our own band of artificers (fueled by copious amounts of coffee and an undying love for the greatest tabletop game) has been diligently toiling away. We've been channeling ancient lores, deciphering cryptic code-runes, and charting new territories in the world of digital D&D tools.

And now, the moment has arrived to draw back the curtain! We're absolutely thrilled to announce that several new creations are ready to see the light of day – and as our most trusted allies, you get the first look!

**🛡️⚔️🎲 The Beta Bonanza is HERE! 🎲⚔️🛡️**

That's right, three of our most anticipated tools are now officially launching into Beta! This is where YOU come in, brave patrons. Your keen eyes, adventurous spirit, and invaluable feedback are the magic ingredients we need to refine these tools from promising prototypes into legendary aids for your gaming table.

Here’s what awaits your discerning gaze:

✨ 1. The Dice Roller Beta: Let Fate Unfold!

Tired of that one d20 that seems cursed, or simply wish for a clean, quick way to see destiny manifest? Our new Dice Roller is ready for its trial by fire (and frost, and acid...). It’s designed to be more than just a number generator; it's an intuitive interface where you can:

* Quickly roll any standard D&D die or combination.
* Clearly see results, including modifiers.
* Understand and apply Advantage/Disadvantage with a simple click.
* Keep a handy roll history for those ""wait, what did I roll for that damage?"" moments.
   * Your Quest: Give it a toss for your next attack roll, saving throw, or wild magic surge! Does it feel right? Is it missing anything? Let us know!

📜 2. The Character Sheet Builder Beta: Forge Your Legend!

Every epic hero, every cunning rogue, every wise old mage starts with a story and a set of stats. Our Character Sheet Builder is designed to be your companion in this creative process. While still in its early stages, this beta aims to help you:

* Input your core ability scores and see modifiers calculated.
* Track your hit points, armor class, and other vital statistics.
* List your skills, proficiencies, and equipment.
* We envision a sheet that grows with your character, making the often-daunting task of character creation and management more accessible and fun.
   * Your Quest: Try building your next iconic character (or a beloved NPC!). What features make sense? What would make it even easier to bring your hero to life on the digital page?

🧭 3. The Narrative Tutorial Beta: Your First Grand Quest in Oakhaven!

Remember the thrill of your very first adventure? We want to recapture that, or create it for someone entirely new! Our Narrative Tutorial is an interactive story designed to gently introduce the core mechanics of D&D 5th Edition. You won't just read rules; you'll:

* Make choices that shape your path through the village of Oakhaven and its looming woods.
* Learn about skill checks by doing them.
* Understand dialogue options and their consequences.
* Experience a simplified combat scenario.
* All guided by our own resident loremaster, F.F. (Fergus Freedgick)!
   * Your Quest: Embark on this guided adventure! Is it welcoming for a new player? Are the explanations clear? Does it capture that D&D spark?

**Why Beta? Your Wisdom is Our Greatest Treasure!**

These tools are in ""Beta"" because they are newly forged and ready for real-world adventuring – your adventuring! As our cherished patrons, you get this exclusive first access. Your insights are like a +5 magical item to our development process!

* Encountered a mischievous gremlin (a bug)?
* Have a flash of inspiration for a new feature or improvement?
* Found a description or instruction a bit confusing?

Please, tell us all about it! Your feedback, suggestions, and even your tales of how you use these tools will directly help us polish them until they gleam like a freshly plundered dragon's hoard. Join our discord and let us know!

**The Road Ahead: More Artifacts in the Making!**

Our quest to support your D&D journeys doesn't stop here! The anvils are still ringing, and the spell components are still being gathered. Here’s a sneak peek at what our gnomes (and a particularly industrious kobold intern) are working on for future release:

For Dungeon Masters:

* A comprehensive Digital DM Screen Tool (quick rules, charts, tables!)
* An intuitive Initiative Tracker
* A helpful Encounter Builder/Balancer
* Random Shop Inventory & Treasure Parcel Generators

For Players:

* An interactive Combat Basics Guide
* A quick and easy Spell Reference Tool
* And much more!

A Goblet Raised to You

Truly, none of this – the current tools, these new betas, or our exciting future plans – would be possible without YOU. Your generous support, your encouraging words, and your shared passion for D&D are the fuel that keeps the fires of Embark D&D burning brightly.

You are the esteemed party members who make this whole endeavor worthwhile, the critical hit on a saving throw, the unexpected ally in a tough fight. Thank you for believing in this project and for being an integral part of our adventure.

Artistly AI (according to their standard terms, which you should always verify) typically grants commercial usage rights for the designs you create. This means you can confidently sell T-shirts featuring your AI-generated artwork without worrying about complex licensing fees.

Tips for T-Shirt Success with Artistly AI:
Master Your Prompts: The more detailed and descriptive your prompt, the better the AI can translate your vision. Experiment with keywords related to style, mood, color palettes, and composition. For example, adding ""vector art style, clean lines, isolated on white background"" can make a big difference for T-shirt readiness.

Text as a Separate Layer: While AI can generate text, for maximum control over font, placement, and legibility on a T-shirt, it's often best to generate the main graphic in Artistly AI and then add your text using a dedicated design tool.

Iterate and Refine: Don't expect the first generation to always be perfect. Use the AI's output as a strong starting point and be prepared to iterate on your prompt or do minor touch-ups.

I find 90% of the time a protect mission will be available at one or the other.

Take the lowest paying 500K ones if you are not very good at combat or your maverick suit (preferable for the post-combat looting) or weapons are not very buffed. I regularly take the 800K ones as they are a bit more challenging but mean I can still do them in my Mav suit and cut into loot like a madman afterwards in the abandoned settlement. The tougher 1.3mil ones I normally need to use a Dominator suit and so do not have an Arc Cutter...

I also normally just go to these in an Apex shuttle, as doing this makes the mission countdown stop upon arrival, and I can make a cup of coffee and start the mission when I want to disembark - also after transferring some ebreaches.

Final tip: You can also re-order the Apex as soon it leaves when you disembark, so that it is there waiting for you as an extra rearming solution.

For back story, him and I talked for about three months before he went on his mission but then I ended up ghosting him because he was going on his mission and I didn’t really want to be involved with that. 

About halfway through his mission he reached out to me via Facebook messenger and we began to talk. He would call me on p day and we’d talk for hours and hours. Eventually he said he wanted to be exclusive so we could date when he got home. I was apprehensive but really liked him so agreed. He talked about marrying me and having kids and discussed a future which I took as a good sign.

Upon his returning home he asked me to be his girlfriend and I agreed. Henceforth we hung out a great deal and were getting along super well. 

He is going to play college football states away so we discussed doing long distance and he agreed to that as well I would come visit him he would see me when he was allowed to come home etc. 

During his mission when we were speaking he made it a point that he didn’t want to keep breaking the rules to speak to me if it wasn’t going anywhere. When we came home we had s*x, he never wore his garments around me, and he would miss church events to hang out with me. 

He told me last week he doesn’t think long distance is going to work because of the distance and if he were staying closer he would continue to date me (even tho we basically did long distance when he was on his mission). 

I’m confused if this breakup has anything to do with his faith or if he just wants to mess around when he gets to school. His parents are very involved in TSCC (snd he kinda idolizes them) and so is he but he breaks a lot of these fundamental rules so I’m just SUPER confused because why won’t he drink coffee but he will have sex and cuss and all this other stuff that’s prohibited.

Hi there! If you’re planning a visit to the charming town of Woodbury, Connecticut, welcome — you’re in for something special. As a local who’s lucky enough to call this scenic corner of the Litchfield Hills home, I’ve had the pleasure of discovering all the best spots for eating, exploring, relaxing, and celebrating. Whether you’re a couple in search of romance, a history buff, or just looking for a peaceful weekend getaway, there’s one place that should be the anchor of your trip:[ 1754 House](https://1754house.com/).

This Historic Connecticut Inn isn’t just a place to stay — it’s the heart of Woodbury hospitality. So let me walk you through a weekend itinerary, local-style, with 1754 House as your cozy home base.

# Friday Afternoon: Check In and Step Back in Time

Start your weekend off right by checking into 1754 House in the early afternoon. Tucked along Main Street South, this white colonial inn is impossible to miss — it radiates charm and old New England elegance. With parts of the building dating back to (you guessed it) 1754, you’ll be staying in one of the oldest continuously operating inns in the state.

The staff are warm and welcoming, and each guest room is unique — think antique furnishings, exposed beams, and plush bedding that guarantees a restful night. This Woodbury CT lodging spot offers the perfect balance of rustic charm and modern comfort.

Pro tip: ask for a room with a garden view or fireplace for peak cozy vibes.

# Friday Evening: Dinner at the Inn

Once you’ve settled in, head downstairs for dinner at the inn’s beloved restaurant. This is one of my favorite spots for New American cuisine in CT. The menu changes seasonally and always highlights fresh, local ingredients — from artisan cheeses and heirloom vegetables to tender cuts of meat and fresh-caught seafood.

Start with the house-made sourdough and a craft cocktail from the tavern. I recommend the rosemary gin fizz or the smoked maple old fashioned. Entrée favorites? You can’t go wrong with the pan-roasted chicken or the braised short rib.

Save room for dessert — the warm apple tart with vanilla bean ice cream is worth the calories.

# Saturday Morning: Exploring Woodbury

After breakfast at the inn (don’t skip the local coffee and house-made granola), it’s time to explore.

Woodbury is known as Connecticut’s antiques capital, so if you love vintage furniture, rare books, or quirky collectibles, you’re in luck. Spend the morning browsing places like Mill House Antiques, Monique Shay Antiques, and Woodbury Auction. Even if you’re not buying, it’s fun to look.

If antiques aren’t your thing, grab your hiking boots and head to Flanders Nature Center. The trails are easy to moderate and take you through woodlands, open meadows, and even past a pond or two. It’s especially gorgeous in the fall.

# Saturday Afternoon: Lunch & Local Discoveries

Swing by New Morning Market for a healthy lunch and some locally made goodies. This organic grocer is a community hub, filled with everything from fresh soups and sandwiches to artisan cheeses and natural wines.

Then, take a short drive to the Glebe House Museum or the Bellamy-Ferriday House for a peek into local history and colonial architecture. You’ll gain a new appreciation for the region’s deep roots — and maybe even feel a little more connected to the walls of 1754 House when you return.

# Saturday Evening: A Toast to Romance

This is the moment you make dinner plans back at 1754 House again — trust me. Each meal here feels like an event, and the menu is too good to only visit once.

If you’re here with your partner, this is where things get extra romantic. Request a table by the fireplace or out on the patio if the weather’s nice. It’s no wonder 1754 House is also a sought-after Connecticut wedding venue. I’ve attended weddings here, and the ambiance is just as dreamy as the photos suggest.

In fact, if you’re planning your own special day, you might want to schedule a quick tour with the staff. They’ll walk you through the options — from intimate ceremonies in the garden to full buyouts of the property. As far as Connecticut wedding venues go, it doesn’t get more timeless than this.

# Sunday Morning: One Last Bite

On Sunday, sleep in and enjoy a slow breakfast. Try the lemon ricotta pancakes or smoked salmon toast. Linger over coffee, take one last walk around the grounds, and soak in the peaceful energy.

Before you leave, stop by the front desk and grab a few recommendations for your next visit. Trust me — one weekend at this[ boutique hotel in the Litchfield Hills](https://1754house.com/) is never enough. Locals like me know that it’s a place to return to, whether for a seasonal dinner, a special occasion, or a little dose of quiet beauty.

# Final Thoughts from a Local

Living in Woodbury has its perks — the scenery, the culture, and yes, the food — but having a gem like 1754 House right in town is something I never take for granted.

This Historic Connecticut Inn offers more than lodging; it offers a genuine experience. Whether you’re here for romance, relaxation, or even researching wedding venues in Connecticut, it delivers every time.

From beautifully curated rooms to unforgettable meals and warm, personal service, 1754 House sets the standard for Woodbury CT lodging. And with its stunning setting in the[ Litchfield Hills](https://1754house.com/), it’s the kind of place that quietly steals your heart — and then has you counting the days until your next visit.

Hope to see you around town. And if you stay at 1754 House, save me a seat in the tavern!",1,1747084645.0,bedandbreakfast,0,1.0,False

I’ve noticed time and time again whenever the donors are attractive young women around my age, I often have intense anxiety come over me.  

This isn’t anything new. This is something I’ve dealt with for a huge chunk of my life. Whenever I’m around pretty girls I freeze up and choke and can’t act cool at all and have intense anxiety symptoms. My hands and body shake, my pitch and tone of voice diminishes, my eyes tear up, my hands become clammy and my eyes look glazed over. My conversation skills are abysmal whenever a pretty girl is around or I’m talking to one. I’m either monotone and boring, or tripping over my words and nervous. 

I’m getting very frustrated with this because recently I had the guts to ask out this girl who volunteers at my job and it took every last drop of courage to talk to her and ask her out for coffee. I was visibly nervous and tripping over my words and had uncomfortable body posture but she said yes and gave me her number just for her to ghost me after one text.

I can’t seem to get the conversation or charisma down to get women to be attracted to me and I struggle to get my nerves under control. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Im a pretty good looking guy and look young for my age, girls have approached me and said im handsome many times. I’ve had a girlfriend before and have had normal convos with good looking women before and am capable of attracting women. But for some reason I’m just in a major slump and can’t seem to get out of it. Yesterday a good looking woman came in and I was doing her physical and I couldn’t stop shaking or talk to her without sounding like a nervous boring dork. 

I’m getting frustrated with my inability to just be able to talk to women or be charismatic enough to secure or date and don’t know how to fix it. ",3,1747084538.0,malementalhealth,7,0.8,False

----

“Oh shit, I need to get going!”

Jayce's voice rings through the room, but I barely register it. He said he needed to go soon a couple of times already, I was just waiting for him to realize that he was late. I don't look up, I don't need to see him leave. A soft sigh still leaves my lips *just tell him goodbye*.

A cough trills through the room, followed by a splash, more coughing, it sounds like choking now.

“Jayce?” 

Now I look up, Jayce stands bent over, beating his own chest, coughing more. He spits coffee out of his mouth, into the mug and on the floor. I should help, but I am frozen. 

Frozen as I watch him heaving, trying to clear his throat with force and gasp for a relieving gush of air. 

His hand trembles slightly as he sets the coffee mug on the table.

“Shit.”

His voice croaks from the strain. There is a dark coffee stain on his pristine, dusky grey vest.

“Shit, shit, shit.” 

He flails his arms helplessly, tiptoes and looks over to me pleadingly as if I could change anything about his misery, but the best I can do is not laugh. 

“Are you alright, Jayce?” 

I cannot keep the amused twist out of my voice, his defeated sigh not making it easier. *Oh the noises that could leave his throat…*

“I need to get changed.” 

He whines like a child, it just entertains me more. But he turns back into a grown man as he groans with frustration and starts to open his vest. It entertains me as well.

One button after another, his movements harsh and annoyed, his chest swollen, the vest parts like it has just been waiting to be freed from tension.

I cannot look away. My eyes are glued to his chest as he stalks through the room. In my direction, while undressing, my heart jumps, I hold my breath.

But he walks past me to the closet in the back, slipping out of the vest halfway there, which he just throws on a table nearby.

I don't know how to move anymore, breathing is foreign to me, my mind is begging for that coffee stain to have seeped through the vest and staining his dress shirt as well.


“I'm sorry, Viktor, I'll clean up later, I really, really have to go now.”

He comes up very close to me, already buttoning up a fresh vest and I force myself to remember how to breathe. 

So I can soak up his smell, the coffee smell overwhelming, but I still recognise him underneath. Sorting through the sensations in my nose, blending out his perfume and the faint metallic smell lingering from the tools he had been handling earlier. So there is only his left.

“I would hope so. Don't think I will clean up your mess, because you are too clumsy to drink.”

“Ha. Ha.” 

He leans in closer, studying the papers in front of me and if I would find the strength to lift my arm, I could touch his coffee tainted chest. Feel if it's still hot from the beverage, maybe he lightly burned himself, skin reddened and sensitive. I imagine him wincing if I touch it.

“It's beautiful.”

*It is*

He means my papers, I'm thinking about something else.

----

The coffee mug sits there on the table, spilled coffee long cold.

I can smell it from across the room, the sharp, bitter smell from cold coffee that makes one wonder why we even drink that stuff. I always wondered why he drinks his coffee like that, not a pinch of sugar or a splash of milk.

I could never. Maybe I can make an exception today.

The smell is tempting, even if it makes me light headed. It gets more penetrating as if it was moving closer, but I am the one moving closer. Rolling with my chair just an inch at a time, I tell myself it's unintentional.

The print of his face on the mug creeps closer, chiseled chin, strong cheekbones, a carefully constructed illustration and still it looks like a caricature. Not even a photograph could capture his charm, and yet the effect on me is nearly the same, breathing faster, head empty, stomach sinking.

The coffee mug sits there on the table.

Drops of coffee on the surface of the table, a line of dripping stains the print. I touch the handle with my fingertips, turning the mug gently. Coffee swooshes around, the smell gets more intense, I peek inside.

There is only a shallow layer of brew left in the mug. On top of it sits white foam, distinct from the brown coffee. 

Little bubbles draw patterns, it looks more solid than the coffee, it looks more slimy. More beautiful than anything the hexcore could ever conjure.

I have to swallow my own spit, forcing it back down my throat, otherwise I would choke as well. Nervousness shakes my bones, excitement shifts my temperature rapidly. Hot head, cold insides. Fingertips somehow more icy than the handle of the coffee mug, it tingles with a burn as I grip it.

A second of hesitation. Contemplating my own demise.

*Disgusting*  I correctly think to myself as I swish the contents of the mug with a careful movement of my wrist. Watching as his choked up spit tries to mix with the coffee, but it's more solid, more slimy.

I want to watch it, study its structure under a microscope, it fascinates me. But the coffee is already so cold.

I don't drink coffee without sugar or milk. But I try it today. It is not a pure black coffee, but I cannot imagine a better ingredient added to it.

Nothing better to coat my tongue, nothing better to travel down my throat, I chug the contents of the mug with haste, scold myself for not savoring it, but I am greedy.

I lick the coffee stains from the mug, he would want his cup clean.

A last desperate and deliberate swallow, I try to feel his spit dripping down my throat, I don't taste the coffee.


I need more, I want more, need him to spit directly into my mouth, I would open up obediently, tongue out, waiting.

*That's ridiculous*

His face on the mug looks through me, gaze full of hope and determination, turned straight ahead for a better future. Chiseled chin, strong cheekbones. I wipe my thumb over it.

I should spit in his mouth. Hold his chin with a tight grip, forcing it open until it is a round hole. Like the opening of a coffee mug. 

I could spit in it like he spat his coffee in his mug. Only this time the mug isn't cold.

I only saw him once a week for about a month and every interaction was overflowing with chemistry. I cherished our 3 minute conversations while checking out and looked forward to going grocery shopping (something I never thought i’d say). 

He ended up giving me his number and we texted frequently throughout our one week we were given. The attraction was mutual, the conversations were fun and warm, and we even sent each other cute little videos. 

We planned a date for my birthday; which was one week after I got his number. The plan was to get coffee and take a little drive up around my town’s natural areas. It seemed that we were both VERY excited, all we texted about was how lovely it was going to be to finally have a chance to talk in person for more than 3 minutes. I even saw him the day before when I got groceries and the interaction was flirty and honestly? probably a little disgustingly cute for everyone else in the store lmao. 

Then the morning of our date (and my birthday), he canned the date, thanked me for my time, and told me we can’t text anymore. 

Whatever, we only texted for a week, should have been able to shrug it off. 

WRONG. 

I’ve been fully crashing out over this guy for a month now. Why? I was excited and felt this profound energy when around him or texting that I haven’t ever felt. But i’m so MAD at myself for still being hung up on a dude that I barely knew and who hasn’t made a single effort to reach back out. I think I feel let down by not having the opportunity to explore the potential possibilities. I feel pathetic for not being able to shake the feelings I acquired for him. 

I embarrassingly texted him too many times in a row after he “ended things” to the point that he blocked me. And you know what I did? started EMAILING HIM. Then he unblocked me at some point and I again, couldn’t stop myself from texting him to the point that I finally bucked up and deleted his number. 

I’m not the type to be this obsessive and crazy. It’s extremely out of character for me and I want these feelings towards him to GO AWAY.

Buckle up, because this is a wild ride.
I (28M) work for a mid-sized tech company, and we’ve been remote for a while. Yesterday was our quarterly all-hands meeting on Zoom, with like 200 people, including the CEO, my team, and my super intimidating boss, Karen (not her real name, but she radiates Karen energy). These meetings are usually boring—slides, KPIs, blah blah—but this time, I managed to turn it into a personal nightmare.
Context: I’ve been dating my girlfriend, Emma, for two years, and I’ve been planning to propose. Got the ring, practiced the speech, the whole deal. I was dumb enough to keep the ring box on my desk because I’m paranoid about losing it. Big mistake.
The meeting starts, and I’m half-listening, muted, camera off, scrolling Reddit (classic). Karen unmutes me out of nowhere to ask about a project I’m leading. I fumble, turn my camera on, and start rambling. Mid-sentence, my cat, Muffin (a furry agent of chaos), jumps on my desk, knocks over my coffee, and sends the ring box flying into view. It pops open, revealing a shiny diamond ring. The Zoom chat EXPLODES. People think I’m about to propose on the call.
I panic, grab the ring, and try to laugh it off, saying, “Haha, no, this isn’t what it looks like!” But my brain short-circuits, and I blurt out, “Karen, it’s not for you, I swear!” Why did I say that? WHY? The entire company goes silent. Karen’s face is a mix of confusion and horror. The CEO coughs. Someone in the chat types, “LMAO WHAT.”
I try to recover by explaining it’s for my girlfriend, but the damage is done. The meeting moves on, but the chat is just memes about me proposing to Karen. By the end, someone’s Photoshopped a wedding invite with my face and Karen’s. My inbox is flooded with “congrats” and heart emojis from coworkers I barely know.
Emma thinks it’s hilarious but also wants to know why I “proposed” to my boss before her. Karen emailed me this morning saying, “We need to discuss professional boundaries.” I’m pretty sure I’m either fired or getting a weird HR seminar.
TL;DR: My cat exposed my engagement ring on a company Zoom call, I accidentally implied I was proposing to my boss, and now I’m the office meme. Send help.",35,1747083936.0,tifu,30,0.67,False
1kl3z8g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kl3z8g,Westin Bora Bora Complete Review,"Recently Spent 5 nights at the Westin Bora Bora. It was my first time in French Polynesia and wow, it did not disappoint.   It is one of the few places where the photos do not do the actual scenery justice. it is hard to capture just how clear and beautiful the water is. I have been luckily enough to travel all over the world (Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, Fiji, Costa Rica, Europe, India, Chile, South Africa, etc) and this might be the most gorgeous place I have ever seen. It's a real highlight for me and up there with going on Safari in South Africa in terms of places that don't feel real and are a shock to your senses (in a good way). 

**Getting There**

Getting there is surprisingly easy if you are already on the West Coast. LAX to PPT is about 8.5 hours non-stop flight. They have flights from LAX, SFO and SEA. Delta has since announced they are no longer going to fly to PPT after June from LAX. We left LAX via Delta at 10:30AM got in about 4:30PM and stayed at the Hilton Tahiti for one night. It's 10 minutes from the airport and taxis are easy to get. They only except cash though so keep that in mind. The only other similar hotel is the InterContinental  but they are renovating their pool right now. The Hilton was pretty nice, perfect for a transit hotel. The food at the Asian Fusion Restaurant (San) at the hotel was also pretty good, but the portions are small. The breakfast buffet was excellent, pretty much everything you could possibly want. Do try to get the breakfast included in your rate because the buffet was $70 something per person if you pay separately. The hotel also connects to the ""mall"" via a bridge which you will want to stop at before going to Bora Bora (more on that later).  The next morning we took Air Moana to Bora Bora which about a 50 min flight.  We were greeted at the tiny airport by a Westin rep. They gave us a nice water bottle to reuse, and off we went on the boat for about a 20 min ride to the hotel.   

  
**Check In:**

**8/10**

We arrived at about 1PM and check-in was a little slow. They get a rush of people since everyone is on the same boat. We were handed a cold towel and a drink but they didn't have enough people to check guests in. Our room wasn't ready when we did check in so keep that in mind if you take one of the early morning PPT- BOB flights in. You might not have access to your room for many hours.  We had lunch and at about 3PM and our room was finally ready.

**Rooms:**

**10/10**

I have the Amex Brilliant Marriott card which gets you automatic Platinum status with Marriott.  I booked this trip with points (285k points for 5 nights plus $2.5K cash for the mountain view, Marriott gives you the 5th night free for point redemptions). The Mountain View is absolutely critical if you go all the way to Bora Bora. Luckily the hotel upgraded us to a 1 Bedroom Villa, Premium Otemanu view which increased the size of the room from 441sq ft to 661 sq ft.  There is a huge walk in closet, large 5 fixture bathroom, plunge pool, etc. The room has everything you could want, it's brand new. A/C works amazing, it got too cold one night and actually woke me up. All rooms to my knowledge have the see through glass to the water in the rooms. There is not a lot of activity and the coral is mostly dead so don't get your hopes up seeing many fish. We did see a few but nothing like what you would think. The view of Otemanu  from the room is just amazing and hard to describe. The only two areas for improvement, the plunge pool is not fresh water like some other hotels have, it is from the sea. Maybe they filter it? There were no screens on the windows so you can't open the blinds for fresh air without letting bugs, mosquitos in.  

  
**Housekeeping:**

**10/10**

Never any issue and the room was always ready when we came back.  Even when we went for breakfast and put the sign to please make up the room it was always done.

**Getting Around:**

**10/10 (If you can ride a bike)**

It is such a great resort to get around, IF you can ride a bike. The bikes are all over the place and anyone can use any bike so you might not have yours when you wake up in the morning. That being said, it was never an issue and it's about a 2 min bike ride to anywhere in the hotel. If you can't ride a bike, this could be a huge PIA because it can take 10 mins to get a golf cart pickup. It is kind of strange they picked gender colors for the bikes (blue and pink). Yellow or Silver would have been a better choice.  Last year we went to Nayara Tented Camp in Costa Rica and were always waiting for a golf cart which becomes a bit annoying after a few days.

**Fitness:**

**10/10**

I do workout even on vacation. They have a brand new gym with 4 treadmills (techogym), 2 bikes (no pelotons), free weights go up to 50 pounds, a smith machine, chest machine, lat machine, etc. The treadmills and bikes have lagoon views to help take the boredom away. You can run around the resort as well. As a runner it's fairly easy to do a few laps around every square inch of the resort and get 4 or 5 miles in. Anything more that that and it's going to get pretty tedious. They did have a run club at 6:30AM everyday which I didn't do as well as some yoga classes. 

**Things To Do:**

Boring Boring is the nickname for Bora Bora but we had enough thing to do to keep us busy. If you are the type who has to explore every day this probably isn't the right place to vacation. When you are at the resort it takes both time and $ to leave the resort.  They do have a free boat ride to the other side a few times a day but you would still need to rent a car or take a taxi to get ""in to town"". The snorkeling around the hotel is not amazing.  

We took a private day trip with Lagoon Services for about $900 and wow was it amazing. We got to snorkel with dozens of reef sharks, stingrays, etc. Highly recommend using them. They provided a lunch which was better food than the resort had. I have heard that if you book a tour through any hotel Westin, FS, Ritz, etc they use the same Lagoon Services with a huge markup. Please be comfortable in the water because the coral garden swim was very tight in some places and swimming with sharks isn’t everyone’s idea of a good time.

  
Eco Center: For $50 per person you get to visit the turtle hospital where they have rescued over 750 turtles since 2000 when the hotel was the Le Meridien. I think it's worth it to learn and if nothing else support such a good cause. It's crazy how only 1 out of 1000 turtles will reach the age of maturity.

  
The resort provides paddle boards, snorkel equipment free of charge. They also had jet skis to rent but I don't know how much it was. 

  
**Service:**

**9/10**

I saw in another review that this is not the type of resort that memorizes your name and preferences like FS and that is 100% spot on. Overall though the staff is incredibly friendly (seems genuine, not forced) and service is still really solid.  Sometimes we had slow service or an order was incorrect, but it wasn't a huge deal. The staff tries incredibly hard to do a good job. My Wife got stung by something snorkeling and the staff called later that day to make sure she was doing well after they sent a security guard to help her. 

**Pool Area:**

**9/10**

There is only one large pool with no hot tubs but with one of the best views in the World. They do have private huts that were shaded that seemed really popular but we never did this. There were tons of chairs available. It's about as opposite of a pool experience as you can have from my Aulani trip with the kids last year.  The pool has a swim-up bar which is nice. Drink orders for some reason took forever even though the bar is 2 feet away from the pool.  The drinks were $11 for a beer, $25-$30 for a mixed drink. I'm not a huge drinker but I found the drinks incredibly weak. Seems like they were half shots or something? They provide sunscreen which is really nice but be warned it will stain bathing suits and anything else it touches. The sun is really intense and will burn you quickly. I did notice the pool needed to be cleaned on the last day. There was some algae that was all over the place. I didn't notice it and of the other days. 

**Food**

**7.5/10**

OK this is the big one, and I have seen it in other reviews before I went. 

Breakfast is a buffet and free if you are Marriott Platinum or higher. Without this perk it is $52 per person. The service is kind of hit or miss which is strange for a buffet. They insist on taking your egg or omelet order at the table with your coffee order. Some times it can take a really long time (20+ mins). The staff does seem to try incredibly hard and the manager Anita is awesome. It is clear they want to do a good job but they just can't put it all together on a consistent basis. I think it would honestly be better if you ordered your eggs and coffee directly.  The food selection though is huge with plenty of choices to make everyone happy. The fruit selection wasn't amazing but that's the only thing I can think of.

  
Lunch:

There is really only one choice for lunch and it's the Varavara restaurant. The restaurant design is amazing, I did get bit by some sand flies the first day so keep that in mind.  They had typical Intl food such as poke bowls $36, burgers $39, Pizza $36, etc. Burger was fine, pizza was good if you ask them to make it extra crispy. The pool has the same food but a more limited menu. This same restaurant also serves the same menu for dinner.

Dinner:

Varavara (same food, see above)

Tipanier (Heavy French food) we didn't try it. 

Maere (specialty restaurant, open 3 days a week) changes constantly. We didn't do this.

Buffett and Dance Show every Thursday ($130 per person, 1 drink included). We thought this was worth it as the buffet had good beef, swordfish and chicken options. 

The issue with food was not the quality although nothing was especially outstanding. The issue we had was the lack of variety of food. They do get a lot of French and European tourists so maybe they like more formal dining? After the 4th day of eating the same lunch you just want something different. Would be nice if there was a buffet every day for dinner or if the pool offered completely different food.

**Things To Bring:**

Absolutely bring any medications, hangover relief, etc with you as they don't sell any of that in the gift shop. Also, bring food and drinks from PPT. We were happy we brought enough food to make some meals without having to go to a restaurant or wait for room service. The mall across from the Hilton has everything you could want for this. Our room had a small fridge which worked well to store (snacks, beer, soda, etc). Also bring your own sunscreen if you don’t like the mineral kind, water shoes, waterproof phone pouch. 

  
**Kids:**

I don't think it's a great resort for small kids since it is mainly a relax and chill type of resort. It is the most quiet resort I have ever been to, probably due to there not being many kids around. The sleeping arrangements would also be an issue along with the water safety issues. Lack of food choices also isn't ideal if you have a picky eater.

**Check Out/Lagoon Rooms:**

**9/10**

You receive a letter late at night with your check out instructions. We got a 12PM check out but they did let us use a lagoon room to shower in for 45 mins which was a nice perk. Those rooms still have a great view of Otemanu but they are building the staff quarters behind those rooms. This would be a better area if you were to bring kids but the lagoon doesn't have many fish to see. They get you to the airport about 1 hour 15 mins before your flight to PPT or wherever you are headed next. There is no security leaving BOB airport which is interesting. We took Air Tahiti back which I think is safer choice in case there are issues they have more flights and planes than Air Moana (they only have 2). 

**Overall**

**9.5/10**

Just a fantastic resort overall and that could have easily been a JW Marriott. The best thing the resort has is the brand new facilities and arguably the best view of Otemanu of any of the hotels. On our day trip we saw all the other hotels and it was interesting how the Conrad has no view of Otemanu and Le Bora Bora had an ugly dock view from many of the rooms. There is no perfect resort, and sure I would love more food variety but wow I can't wait to come back. This is the type of resort you could return to year after year for ultimate relaxation.

PG: So you have a Final Destination sequel for me?!

SWG: Yes sir, I do!

PG: Oh boy, tell me all about Final Destination 4?

SWG: Well sir, I was told by the other executives this might be the last FD movie, so I changed the title to make it more fitting.

PG: Really, what did you change it to?

SWG: The Final Destination.

PG: Did you just add a ""the"" to the beginning of the title?

SWG: Yeah, pretty creative, huh?

PG: To be honest, not really. Plus, it might be confusing some people.

SWG: Well, maybe some people will just end up calling it Final Destination 4, or 3-D, or something.

PG: Wait, 3-D?!

SWG: That's right, sir. We're hopping right on that 3-D trend right now. It did really good for that *My Bloody Valentine* remake*.*

*PG:* That's cool, is the CGI  gonna look good for the 3-D?

SWG: No.

PG: Ah.

SWG: So, this movie starts with a guy named Nick O'Bannon and he's at a racing event with his friends.

PG: Oh really?

SWG: Yeah, his friend, Hunt, really wants to see a massive car crash.

PG: He sounds pretty unlikeable, but at least it's just hi--

SWG: And this mechanic guy and his wife take Hunt's liquor with his permission.

PG: Ok, them too--

SWG: And some mom is gonna put tampons in her two sons' ears and embarrass them.

PG: Um--

SWG: And some guy is gonna whistle Dixieland in front of the black security guard.

PG: Ok, are any of these people appealing like at all?!

SWG: Not really sir, the least rudest someone does in this scene is wear a cowboy hat.

PG: It sounds like you think people watched the last movie was because the terrible characters.

PG: Alright, just get to the premonition, please?

SWG: Well, after a bunch of unorthodox scenarios, a car starts crashing & tumbling and creates a huge accident, people are gonna get mutilated from flying car parts or destroyed by debris, and it's all because of a busted tire.

PG: That doesn't sound real believable.

SWG: Exactly sir, the people aren't gonna believe what they're watching.

PG: Nah, I meant... is it gonna look believable, at least?

SWG: Uh, by what definition of believable?

PG: Nevermind, just keep going please?

SWG: Well, Nick's gonna see him and his girlfriend, Lori, die and then now the premonition's over.

PG: Figures.

SWG: And Nick starts predicting  almost everything that happens in his premonition right before it all happens.

PG: Oh nice, now his friends will believe him about all his prediction later.

SWG: No, they don't really think much of it, even when the survivors start dying later.

PG: Oh, a very hard to hard to convince friend group.

SWG: So, Nick starts freaking out and tries to leave the stadium.

PG: So, they let him leave?

SWG: No, they try to keep in his seat and it starts a fight.

PG: Why don't they let him leave?

SWG: Well, it's gonna get some people out of the stadium so we can have characters in the movie.

PG: So, is all those unlikeable characters leave the stadium right before the crash?

SWG: Almost, the racist guy's wife and the cowboy guy don't leave.

PG: Got it.

SWG: And the mechanic's girlfriend dies in a ridiculous fashion.

PG: Wait, Death is already moving, it usually takes days to a month?

SWG: I thought of a crazy, funny death, so I had to do it immediately.

PG: As long it's just this one time, I mean this is a horror movie.

SWG: Yeah.... so Nick and his girlfriend decide to go to the moral where some of the other characters are.

PG: Oh right, who are the other main characters?

SWG: Well, there's only like 5 main characters sir, most of these characters are only gonna have like one other scene.

PG: Sounds like a waste but tell me about the...characters?

SWG: So, besides Nick, Lori and Hunt, there's another friend named Janet and the security guard's name is George.

PG: Ok and everyone else?

SWG: Well, the mechanic guy's name is Andy, that mom's name is Samantha, and that racist guy's name is Carter and he's a tow driver.

PG: Carter? Like the bully guy in the first movie?

SWG: Yeah, I'm not good with names, it might just say Racist in the credits, by the way he's gonna say a slur since I think I can still do that in this day and age.

PG: Huh?

SWG: So, Nick is getting these visions and I thought this is where the main 3-D gimmick of the movie can start.

PG: Oh, cash grab 3-D gimmicks are tight!! 

SWG: So, Carter goes to George's house to commit a hate crime because he blames hi for his wife dying earlier.

PG: How does he find George's house?

SWG: Unclear, so we're gonna have Carter die after his tow truck drags him across the road playing *Why Can't We Be Friends?* and him & the truck catch on fire.

PG: Ok, that was good, too, but that's it right? 

SWG: .......So, the main characters find out about racist Carter's death, so Nick tells Lori about his visions and how he saw this happen already right before getting another one.

PG: Does he try to find out where the other person is from the vision?

SWG: No, they're gonna die, too, before it does something?

PG: Oh, I get it, he doesn't know the rules yet so he can't figure out who's next from the vision, right?

SWG: I mean it's pretty implied to be a hair salon, but sure. So, the next victim is the mom, Samantha, who gets pierced eye with a rock in front of a kid.

PG: Sounds graphic, how do they--

SWG: Right after we set it up with one liner.

PG: What?

SWG: Yeah, she's gonna say ""I got my eye on you two"" right before it happens.

PG:  Ok, this is the last funny death, right? This is a horror, you know?

SWG: Uhh...not really sir, there's actually a few more.

PG: But--

SWG: So, after Nick sees the news article of Samantha dying he shows it Hunt and Lori and some articles about the characters from the last few movies.

PG: And do they believe him now?

SWG: Well, Lori does, Hunt just goes we lost a hot MILF and he's gonna go get laid.

PG: Are we rooting for this guy at all?

SWG: No, he has no real reaction anybody dying, but don't worries he's gonna die soon, just wait.

PG: ....I can wait.

SWG: You're scary+ sir. So, Nick and Lori go the race track where they run into the security guard and after looking at some footage Nick figures out that Andy the mechanic dies next.

PG: So they find him and try to save them?

SWG: You know it sir, that's what people come to see, of course.

PG: Oh wow wow wow...........wow.

SWG: So they find Andy who's trying to cope with his girlfriend's death and George tells him how he can relate since he lost his wife and kid in a drunk driving accident.

PG: Ahh man, some drunk guy killed his family.

SWG: Well, he was the one drinking sir, he's an alcoholic.

PG: Oh?

SWG: A struggling one, so there's at least something.

PG: Could've lead with that.

SWG: Anyway, they don't save Andy he gets minced by the fence.

PG: Oh, fence mincing is tight!!! But don't think your kind of wasting these characters a little.

SWG: Well, I already wrote the script sir, how about some fake outs for the audience to enjoy, I'll add some in the movie?

PG: I mean you could go back and--

SWG: So, Nick thinks Hunt and Janet are next but here's the thing, they both died at the same time in the premonition.

PG: Uh oh!!

SWG: And Nick gets these--

PG: \*phone rings\* Hold on keep going I should take this. Hey Ari!!!

SWG: Ok, Nick gets more of those 3-D vision and these are all water related.

PG: (To SWG) That nice, man. (To Ari Larter) Oh that's so cool, Ari, you met Beyonce? I'm proud of you!!

SWG: ...So Janet's at a car wash and Hunt's at a country club objectifying chicks and pushing kids into pools.

PG: (To SWG) Yeah, yeah, they suck. (To Ari Larter) Look Ari, Beyonce seems like a nice lady but I've met Puffy and you shouldn't go to his parties. Ok bye, see you later.

SWG: Was that Ari Larter?

PG: Yeah, she's really excited about filming with Beyonce in her new movie.

SWG: Nice, I might reference her since you've brought her up. Anyways, Death tries to kill Janet by drowning her in her car or scrubbing her face, but George and Lori are on their way to save her.

PG: Well, it still sounds like it's gonna be hard to save her at that car wash.

SWG: Actually it's gonna be super easy barely an inconvenience.

PG: Oh really.

SWG: Yeah, George uses his somehow indestructible truck to push Janet's car back and Lori saves her last minute, it's all good.

PG: Ok now get to Hunt's death, PLEASE?!

SWG: So, Hunt actually accidently drops his lucky coin in the pool so he dives in to go get it.

PG: What? Just get another coin you dummy. There are another coins.

SWG: But, he doesn't he's also accidently messed with the water pressure gets his butt stuck on the really strong drain.

PG: Uh huh, uh huh, keep going?

SWG: And, Nick arrives but he can't find Hunt so we see his gut burst out of the drain in 3-D, of course.

PG: Ok, thanks, wait, how does Nick and his friends react to Hunt dying?

SWG: He barely reacts and we'll never mention it again.

PG: You know what? Fine.

SWG: So, Nick and Lori decide to meet with George to see if it's over and George reveals he's been tryin to kill himself all day and so they think it's over now.

PG: Why would they think it's over? There's still some thing pretty supernatural about George failing to commit suicide.

SWG: Heyshutup, so Nick finds out that the cowboy guy, who's name is Jonathan actually survived and is in the hospital so he takes George to find him since thinks Death's still after them and it's gonna kill Jonathan.

PG: How does he figure that out with little to no knowledge of the rules?

SWG: I don't know.

PG: That works.

SWG: They find him right before he somehow gets crushed by a bath tub and this old man saw it all happen.

PG: Oh, that poor old guy.

SWG: No, he's racist ,too. He teases a Chinese doctor about the Korean war.

PG: Are there anymore racists in this movie?

SWG: Yeah, some guy has Dixieland set as a his ringtone.

PG: God, I hate these people.

SWG: And so, Nick and George leave the hospital and George starts mentioning him getting deja vu.

PG: Where is this going?

SWG: He gets hit by an ambulance kinda like how Terry died in the first movie, so it's a good call back.

PG: Seems kind of random and it might come off as lazy.

SWG: Ok sir, I'm gonna level with ya, I didn't sleep when I was finishing up this script so stuff is just gonna happen.

PG: Oh ok.

SWG: I also may have forgotten the order everyone dies in.

PG: What?

SWG: So, Lori and Janet are at the mall to see an overrated 3-D movie that everyone is seeing.

PG: This isn't a good place to break the forth wall, buddy.

SWG: And Nick goes to find them after leaving his car in the middle of traffic cuz he has another vision.

PG: Why does he just leave his car?

SWG: Because.

PG: Fair enough.

SWG: So he finds them right before the theater explodes and the debris kills Janet.

PG: But you said she died at the same time as Hunt earlier, right?

SWG:........So there's a bunch of explosions from the theaters, and this escalator comes apart and Lori gets crushed by the escalator gears.

PG: Yeah...

SWG: But it turns out, that was all another premonition, so--

PG: Wait, Nick has premonition were he doesn't die?

SWG: Yeah, why?

 PG: I mean these characters usually die at the end of the premonition.

SWG: Really, never noticed?

PG: In the 2nd movie, it's kind of implied that these are about how the person getting them dies.

SWG: Well I didn't watch the 2nd movie sir, it wasn't a stand alone.

PG: Alright, where are we now?

SWG: We're back right before George dies so he dies again.

PG: Ok that might as well--

SWG: So, Nick blocks traffic again.

PG: Huh?

SWG: And he goes behind the screening to find a fire and a bunch of spontaneously combustible barrels.

PG: If the barrels are spontaneously combustible then they'll combust at anytime, they don't need a fire.

SWG: Heyshutup, so Nick just manages to stop Death from blowing up the theater mall and two weeks later he's known a hero.

PG: How did--

SWG: So he tells this construction worker about a safety hazard because it pays to be safe then immediately jaywalks to a coffee shop.

PG: Uh huh?

SWG: And Janet and Lori are there, but Nick starts to see a bunch of signs of Death in the restaurant and realizes that he probably did change anything.

PG: I mean they didn't do anything different from earlier to stop Death, why did he think it was over?

SWG: I don't know but him, Lori and Janet get hit by a semi truck and die, it's done.

PG: He didn't get a vision for that?

SWG: Well sir, don't you want to see some awesome x-ray shots of there deaths to close off the movie?

PG: Oh yeah, put those in there screw 'em.

SWG: So what do you think?

PG: Well, I hope the 3-D gimmick carries this thing, I really want to beat Saw this year.

SWG: Well, Saw is doing some boring story about health insurance which I doubt will age well, so we're good.

PG: Ok, and you're sure making the character douchebag fodder is good idea?

SWG: Of course sir, people don't watch movies for plot or characters, they just watch them to see stuff happen.

PG: Ok, but the title, that is really bothering me, are you sure we should keep it like that?

SWG: Sir, it's not that confusing trust me.

1kl3xap,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1kl3xap/paris_trip_review/,Paris trip review,"My mom and I just came back from the most incredible trip to Paris, where we spent a solid week there from May 1-May 9. Here's some things I would keep in mind from what we experienced:

1. You definitely can't do all of Paris in a few days. Give yourself at least a week to soak in all the culture, architecture, history, and of course, food. Two weeks would be ideal to really take everything in. We visited the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, Champs Elysées, Sacré Coeur, Musée d'Orsay, Seine River, Notre Dame, Pantheon, Monet's Gardens, Versailles, Tuileries Gardens, and the Luxembourg Gardens. We didn't have time for and wish we could've seen the Picasso Museum, Palais Garnier, Sainte-Chapelle, Centre Pompidou, Loire Valley, the Catacombs, and Père Lachaise. There's so many things to do in Paris that one week even isn't enough to properly see everything- even the Louvre alone is enough for a full week, if not more.



2. My mom and I finally got around to using the metro system on the second day of our trip, and we loved it. We opted for the Navigo passes and used them daily at least a few times. They are very easy to load and recharge money onto them to easily and conveniently get around Paris. The metro and train fares cost a flat rate of 2.50 euros per trip, and they hold up for connecting metro and train rides, so the system is really well thought out and inexpensive at the end of the day.



3. We didn't see any physical acts of pickpocketing, but we did see our hand of scammers and potential pickpocket perpetrators. You can tell who is actively trying to pickpocket based on if they make a lot of commotion in busy areas, if they have large empty canvas tote bags, if they go around in small groups of 3-4, and/or if they seem like they're not speaking in native French but another language. Just be especially wary around the metro and touristy places like the Sacre Coeur on Montmartre, where we saw girls with clipboards getting people to sign their ""petitions"". We actually saw a couple get coerced into signing and they ended up having to donate 5-10 euros to the ""cause"" at hand.



4. Parisians are truly lovely people through and through and will generally help you if you need it, but they will not go out of their way to help you. Think of them as a bit similar to New Yorkers; they're kind but not nice, whereas people like Californians would be the opposite as nice but not kind. Parisians generally enjoy conversing with visitors in French, so if you know a bit of key phrases that can help your journey in Paris, it will go a long way with the locals.



5. I feel like things you have to visit while in Paris: the Louvre/Musée d'Orsay, Versailles, and Monet's Gardens. I agree that many of the other major landmarks are obviously things you must visit, but I would argue that they're not necessarily interesting and appealing to everybody. I would say that the four places I mentioned have more than enough to satisfy everyone's distinct preferences and will leave people more than happy with their visits. That being said, I would also recommend for Versailles and Monet's Gardens to order a tour to be able to get there and get fast access into these designated areas. Monet's Gardens' gift shop was also surprisingly really nice and we ended up spending over 150 euros there for souvenirs.



6. Be prepared to spend quite a bit on food everyday. The average Parisian meal consists of a drink, appetizer, main course, dessert, and if you're up for it, a coffee to round out the meal. Typical meals go anywhere from 20-100 euros easily per person, with 20 euros being the absolute lowest end (unless you eat at a fast food joint). Almost all sit down restaurants will be within this price range, so a lot of your funds will be devoted towards food. That said, the food in Paris is unmatched and absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. Tip is included, so you never have to worry about paying extra after the meal.



7. Some other small odds and ends of Paris: Paris is a smoking culture and city, so expect to have to deal with a lot of second hand smoke. The time that the sun sets in Paris is give or take around 9-10pm, so their day is shifted from what most people are used to. Parisians typically get into work at around 9-10am, and they get off at around 7-8pm. They'll typically eat dinner around 8-9pm and go to sleep at around 2-3am. With that said, meal times are pretty strict in Paris- if you want breakfast, it's typically served around 6-8am in the morning. Lunch is anywhere from 12-3pm, and dinner is from 7-10pm. And they're pretty strict about it too as most places that serve food will take a break around 3-5pm.



8. In total for the two of us for one week, we spent about $2200 USD for plane tickets, $2000 for lodging at a three star hotel, $1500 for food, and about $1300 for everything else including transportation, shopping, and gifts. The overall trip total for us was around $7000 USD, or roughly $3.5k per person.

Eventually, I figured out she was single and shot my shot. 

I asked her out, and it was really cute because at first she didn't understand. I wanted to ask about what my intentions were since she is from a foreign country. I told her that for us, a date isn't a super serious request it's more of hanging out between 2 people to find out if a relationship was possible. 

Her words were among the following

Part 1.

""You're a really nice guy, but I wasn't expecting to start dating because I graduate in a few months.""

I took it at face value, but then I got hit with this

""But if I can't get a job in town, I'll ask you out."" 

Which has sent me into a spiral of hope that's got questions in my head going absolutely insane. 


Fast forward a few months, and the group still hangs out and even goes on a trip together. Eventually, she decided to move to a big city for 3 months to test the waters and then went back home. Initially, it was only for a few months, but I haven't heard from her since March. 

But before she left, I sent her a message the night she was leaving and said something along these lines

""I wanted to ask you for coffee to say goodbye properly, but I got too nervous. I hope you will see a better me next time we meet. "" 

Am I being dense?
Or am I being overly optimistic?

1kl3qsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1kl3qsa/observations_prices_and_thoughts_after_3_nights/,"Observations, Prices, and thoughts after 3 nights at Caesars and the surrounding strip area.","These are in no particular order, but just my thoughts as they come to me.

1.  A single draft beer at Brewdog cost $14.50.  The bartender here wasn't rude, but wasn't exactly paying attention to the customers either.  After serving my beer, he spent a lot of time chatting with his co-worker about tattoos.  

2.  A single draft beer (Kona Big Wave) at Ole Red cost $17.50.  The bartenders here were super friendly and nice though.  Made me want to come back, but not at $17.50 per beer.  

3.  A can of Elysian Space Dust IPA cost $12.99 at the Caesars Pool.  The bartenders (Alan/Oscar) here are extra friendly and made spending $12.99 for a can of beer somehow sort of alright.  

4.  If you do not like crowds, Caesars is not the place to be.  It was unbelievably crowded everywhere in the afternoons and evenings.  

5  We went exploring one morning and ended up at The Salt & Ivy restaurant in Aria for breakfast.  It was trash food and trash service.  The restaurant was basically empty and there were 3 couples in line.  They just made all of us still wait a long time to be seated.  We finally asked to just sit at the bar to now have to wait.  My wife said the eggs benedict were ok, but as for potatoes, they gave some sort of potato cube - it was so small and about the size of of 2 golf balls side by side ($26).  I made the mistake of ordering the chicken and waffles ($27).  It came with 3 pieces of chicken strips and a cold waffle.  The syrup was some kind of supposed sweet/spicy syrup - it tasted like cough syrup.  This place is trash for both the food and the service.  

6.  The day after breakfast at Salt & Ivy, we had breakfast at Cafe Americano in Caesars.  It was nearly the same exact menu as Salt & Ivy but everything was about $2 more - they even had the same Chicken and Waffles with the nasty syrup (same description).  I had the Denver omlette (Can't screw that up) and wife had Avocado Toast (Tough to mess up).  Service was good and the food was acceptable.  It's still completely overpriced, but it is the strip.  

7.  We were in the Octavious Tower with 2 Queen beds.  Aside from the outrageous $62.30/night fee, no complaints about the room.  The bed was comfy and the room was roomy.  They had a keurig coffee maker, but no refrigerator.  They did have the mini bar fridge, but it's useless for personal items.

8.  We went to the Arts District twice.  The first time, we had a drink at Stray Pirate and then went to Jammyland for some delicious Carribean Food.  The meat pie and jerk wings are so good there.  We went to the Arts District again on Sunday afternoon and ate Soul Belly BBQ.  We had the pork belly and brisket.  It was excellent!  The pricing on food and drinks in the Arts District doens't make you feel like you're being robbed, like when you buy food and drinks on the strip.  Plus, all the servers we've encountered in the Arts District are so nice.  It's well worth the $15 Lyft/Uber ride (each way) go to the Arts District to eat as opposed to the highway robbery pricing on the strip.

9.  Spent some time at Palace Station Casino yesterday.  The slots are so much friendlier there.  I won $240 and my wife won $170 playing the silly ""Stinkin Rich"" slot machines.  We didn't try it, but they have a $5.99 cheeseburger special 24/7 and $2 Margaritas.  The cocktail waitresses are also quick if you are playing slots.  It really felt like old vegas (but cleaner) here.  Next time, we'll do our slot playing here.

10.  Stage Door Casino / Convenience Store - It's about a long block down from the Cromwell.  Go here for bottled of water or alcohol for you room.  It's normal pricing here.  I got three 1.5 liter bottles of water ($2 each).  You can also get a $1 beer and/or $3 for a beer and hot dog here at their bar.  It's sketchy there at night, but safe during the day.  

11.  I am old enough to remember when you had to drive to the next casino on the strip and through later times like when the Bellagio was under construction.  The strip was fun back then, food and drinks were cheap and the establishments tried to offer value to their guests.  Now, the prices and lack of competition on the strip really makes the strip experience not very fun.  With Caesars and MGM basically owning most of the properties, everything is so overpriced and basically the same at each of the different Casinos - it's like the strip is just one big giant casino now.  

12.  The best parts or our trip were when we were off the strip - at the Arts District and at Palace Station.  We also spent a little time at the Orleans and that was nice too.  

13.  I hope the Vegas Strip can somehow get a correction and lower the outrageous resort fees, food, and drink prices.  I'm guessing it'll never happen, but one can hope.",28,1747083317.0,vegas,12,0.86,False

I have been watching (way too many of) Lance Kendrick's videos lately and although they're fascintaing, there is a ton of information to get back to and I had a really hard time locating something that I remember him saying:  apparently if you try to push the filter paper against those indentations in the walls of the v60, you can mitigate bypass inherent in this design.

But what I don't understand is- why do some people do this and most don't?  It occurs to me through most, if not all of the information that Lance puts out there indicates that bypass is a bad thing and we want to mitigate it, so although the v60 conical shape is beneficial, we might want to push filters against these indentations so that the coffee bed is extracted at a uniform flow rate.

Can y'all help me understand the advantages or disadvantages of doing this?  Bonus points if you can find the damn video w/ the timestamp and prove that I'm not imagining he said this lol.  Please don't reply ""don't worry about it"" or ""the v60 is designed properly, so you need to accept that bypass makes better coffee"" etc.  I'm trying to understand something about optimal flow rate.

Content myself with the sour touch

Of my brow against his lips

When I take my leave,

In one last caress,

Bittersweet.

.

I can no longer look at him,

I fear to find him starved,

I even fear for the constellation

That bears his name:

Cowardly Lion,

I cannot ask him for courage,

I cannot ask him to devour,

This friendship's warm carcass.

.

I cannot invite him

For a coffee, a joint,

A drink,

I cannot surrender

When he asks to hold me,

I cannot allow myself to be deceived 

By pleonasms and lyricism,

By dear maladapted daydreams,

By a past made of blurred themes. 

.

I must convince myself

That his hand upon my arm,

His palm within my palm,

His touch upon my leg,

His face against my chest,

Meant nothing, but nothing at all,

For through reality's delirium,

Through gravity's flaw,

His waves never met my shore.

.

I will yield to not knowing him,

I will write this final verse:

About his hands, his nexus, his face,

I shall bid farewell to this malaise,

I will forever renounce his name,

In one last bravado:

Leonardo.

My head swayed slightly against the rain-lashed glass as the carriage gently rocked side to side. I had been travelling for over five hours from Durham, and the time had allowed me another painful session of introspection at just what in God’s name I thought I was doing with my life.

It was a stupid, foolish decision that had marred my best years of youth with the weight of things long dead. I was twenty-eight, nowhere near the end of my life, but it sure as hell felt like it as I thought back on the events that led me to taking a train ride across the length of the country to some forsaken seaside town in the southeast of England. I had squandered years of parties, nights out and untold fun by choosing to do a Bachelor’s in Classics at Oxford. My parents had been so proud the day I got into one of the most prestigious universities in the world, completely overlooking the fact that their son had chosen a degree that would lead him to literally nowhere.

My first years at university were not what I had envisioned. In the Classics department, there were no parties or events or mixers, or anything of the sort. The type of people who chose Classics were already old by the time they reached adulthood, living fossils hidden by their youthful exterior. I made few friends, barely acquaintances now, ten years later. I had resolved to change my luck by applying for a Master’s degree at Cambridge, but my poor decision-making skills had once again led me down a path of little reward. I had decided to study at the Faculty of Divinity, an overly lofty name for a school that specialised in taking the more interesting aspects of (primarily Christian) religion and poisoning it with academic misery. I learned a lot, sure, but to what end? I wasn’t even religious myself, despite my mother being a devout Church of England follower. I got that from my dad, for sure. He was a man of logic and rational thought, no doubt it’s what led him to become a family doctor at a clinic in my hometown of Leeds. He hadn’t reacted well to my choice to go to Cambridge. For days after I had told him, he’d lecture me on trying to find something useful to study or to maybe even retrain and do another Bachelor’s in something like Economics or Law. You know, *real* subjects. Yet something in me made me stick to my decision out of spite, leading me to where I am now: on a train, going to a lonely town on the very tip of the country.

I hadn’t wanted to go into archaeology at first, not until I had met Professor Stewart Landry. He was a giant in the field, intelligent, surprisingly charismatic, and seemed to be genuinely passionate about uncovering the secrets of the past. He was very much one of those people who believed that the past could teach us about where we were going in the future, as a society. I hate to say it, but at the time, I believed him. And so, against yet more protesting from my father, I applied for the PhD programme in Durham. I had been assigned to Professor Landry’s research party as soon as I joined, specialising in both pre-Christian Britain and Anglo-Saxon faith. With my background in Cambridge, he said that I’d be a perfect fit for his team. I use the word *team* very generously here. It was myself and one other student called Mitchell, who I can honestly say is the very vision of what I never wanted to become as a man. Skinny, devoid of any character besides his work, and kind of rat-like.

I had resolved not long after joining that I would be leaving the programme, but all those plans had been put on hold the day I received an email from Prof. Landry last week, detailing an urgent summons to the small town of Whitport on the Kent coast. I stopped staring out the window and opened my laptop, scanning over the email again for any small details I needed to remember. If we had missed anything, it was too late to turn back now.

*Hello Matthew,*

*Hope you had a pleasant Easter break. Do anything nice? I won’t beat around the bush, something very exciting is in the works. I’m sure you may have heard about the unfortunate cliff collapse in Whitport that happened over the weekend, just terrible stuff. What’s interesting is that I received an email from one Ms. Margaret Wright of the Whitport Historical Society the day after it happened. It turns out, they found something in the collapse that might be of great interest to us. Apparently, the old chapel of St. Mary was heavily damaged, but Ms. Wright claims that the disaster has unearthed a section of the chapel no one knew existed!*

*She’s asked me to come review the findings, as the chapel dates back to the tenth century. I’m asking for you to accompany me to Whitport next week so we can survey the ruins and see what they’ve found. This would be an amazing opportunity to form the basis of a new thesis for your own studies too, as well as get us out the office for a few days. I’ll head to Whitport ahead of you to meet with the Historical Society on the Wednesday, but if you could bring the bag with the new brushes, trowels, and the small and large photo scales on the Friday, that would be most helpful.*

*I’ve put us up in a B&B on the coast, not far from the collapse site. Don’t worry, the locals assure me that section of the cliff is safe. Shouldn’t take us more than a few days. I’ll send you the accommodation details on WhatsApp when I get the chance.*

*Best regards,*

*Stewart.*

 

And so, here I am, on the fast train to the southeast coast with a duffle bag full of tools and another of my belongings, wishing I was literally anywhere else in the world.

I pulled into Whitport in the early evening. It was still raining when I stepped off onto a sad looking station platform, bracketed by a hideous bridge made from that nasty gravelly stone that seems to have been all the rage in post-war Britain. A couple people stepped off with me, but none of them paid each other heed as they all scurried over to a small gate to the left of the station building leading out to the street. The station was on a small hill, giving me a slightly elevated view of the town that was to be my home for the next few days. Whitport didn’t look as dismal as I expected, but the weather certainly didn’t help to improve the image. From the station I could see two pubs side by side (one of which was creatively named *The Railway Tavern*, top marks for whoever named that one.) I thought about heading into one of them before going to the B&B, but my body groaned and ached from a full day of travel. It’s amazing how tired you can feel when sitting down for ninety percent of your day. There was a tiny taxi office just down from the hill, and so I plodded towards it, making sure to keep the bag with the equipment secure on my shoulder. The office was poorly lit and spartan on the inside, with a pair of moth-eaten chairs in front of a simple desk. The man behind it looked like he had died back in the nineties yet stubbornly refused to give in to the grave. He was short, fat and balding. Exactly the type of person I expected to find in a place like this. When he spoke, it was like the final breath of ten thousand spent cigarettes wheezing as one.

“Evenin’, what can I do ya for?”

“Um, I’m looking to get a cab to the uhh…” I checked my WhatsApp messages from Stewart. “To the Beach House B&B on uh, Priory Road?”

“Ah yeah. Gotcha mate,” he turned to a room in the back and yelled so loud and suddenly I jumped. “Oi Gary! Punter ‘ere for ya!” A skinny man with skin as sallow and yellowed as the wallpaper came out in a shirt stained with God knows what.

“Yeah, come with me, mate. Where you ‘eadin’?”

The taxi drive wasn’t long at all, and I realised I could have easily walked the route myself. Gary, my illustrious chauffeur, was sadly, a talker. While the drive was scarcely ten minutes, he had somehow managed to say more words than all Dickens novels combined in that time, going on about where I’m from, what brought me to Whitport, along with more than a few veiled comments about me being a “posh toff” for going to Oxbridge. I responded with the bare minimum. Looking back, I could have asked him about the collapse, was he there when it happened, was anyone hurt etc. But I just couldn’t be bothered to even attempt to muster the level of interest or courtesy to ask.

The B&B was grander than I expected. A great big Victorian house down a quiet road with a sea view. As Gary drove off, I looked up at the end of the street. Where I would normally see the sea during the day, at night there was only a vast expanse of black out into the beyond. It was strangely intimidating, made all the more so by the single streetlight that sputtered at the end of the road. I turned away and made my way up the steps to the house, noting the quaint little sign showing a faded image of a blue beach hut. The air smelled of salt and something else unidentifiable. I wrinkled my nose as I took it in, a pungent sour scent that felt like a mix of overripe fruit and something pickled. I knocked twice and rang the bell, readjusting my bags and taking in the details of the large front door. It was definitely Victorian, with red and green stained glass bordering the chipped painted white door. It opened, flooding a warm light out onto the doorstep and myself, where a short, almost spherical woman greeted me.

“Oh, you must be the professor’s boy! Come in, come in, I’m Judy Carter, let me help you with your bags.”

“Oh no, that’s not–”

“My husband Brian is in the living room with your professor.” She’d already picked up the duffle with my belongings before I could say another word. “He’s very clever that man. The professor, not my husband,” she laughed before I even registered what she’d said. “All over our heads, I’m afraid. I’m not one for all that smart talk. Where is it you’ve come from again?” Her cheeks were red and rosy, and her voice clearly showed that she had burned through several packs of cigarettes a day back in her youth.

“Durham.” I replied, stepping inside the warm, surprisingly spacious hallway. It really was a beautiful house, with authentic diamond tiles on the floor and original fixtures on the doorframes and staircase. The sour salty air outside had been replaced by the smell of tea and something smoky. The central heating seemed to be on full blast, making me feel almost dizzy as the cold rain on my shoulders evaporated off in an instant.

“Oh, that’s a long way. Had an aunt up that way in Middlesbrough. Your room is on the first floor, end of the hall. Bathroom is straight ahead at the top of the stairs. Me and Brian are on the top floor to the left. Just give us a shout if you need anything.”

“Thank you,” I said as I followed Judy to where I’d be staying. The room was small but very cosy, facing the street below with the yawning blackness of the sea to the left. The room was decorated with a litany of cliched seaside memorabilia, seashells, a model boat, paintings of seagulls. It was so tailored to out-of-towners I half expected a *Live, Laugh, Love* placard hanging above my bed. “I’ll head downstairs in a minute.”

Judy shuffled off, leaving me to unpack. For a moment I just sat there on the bed looking out into the rainy night beyond. A streetlight stood directly outside the house, giving me a clear view of the shadowed streets as they glistened in the artificial glow. It was a little eerie, I thought, how everything beyond the circle of light seemed to melt away into darkness. I could barely make out the pointed shapes of the neighbouring houses, which seemed strange. It wasn’t until after I turned to unpack that I realised that not one of the other homes in the street had any lights on. I don’t know why, but that realisation compelled me to shut the curtains immediately.

I came downstairs to find the door to the living room was ajar, warm yellow light spilling into the hallway like butter over toast. I hovered for a moment, unsure if I should knock or just walk in. Judy hadn’t said whether I should make myself known or wait to be summoned like some Victorian butler. But then I heard Stewart’s laugh—deep and rich and maddeningly confident—and decided I was too tired to be awkward.

“Ah, there he is!” Professor Landry exclaimed the moment I stepped inside, as though he’d conjured me with his voice. He was sitting in a high-backed armchair that looked like it had never once left this room, a cup of tea in one hand and a biscuit perched daintily on the saucer. The other occupant, presumably Brian, gave me a small nod from the sofa. He had the look of a man who had retired ten years ago and hadn’t changed his jumper since.

“Long trip?” Stewart asked, and I just nodded, too tired to complain again. “Sit down, sit down. Have a biscuit. Judy’s homemade. Dangerous things, mind you—eat three and your blood sugar spikes to medieval levels.”

I sat down, and the armchair sighed under my weight. It was ludicrously comfortable, and for a brief moment I considered falling asleep right there in front of them.

“So,” I said, more to keep myself conscious than anything else, “what’s this amazing discovery? Or are you going to make me wait until morning like some kind of academic sadist?”

Stewart grinned. “Straight to the point. I like it. Well, I won’t give you everything just yet—consider it a little incentive to not bail on me and head back to Durham. But yes, it’s genuine. Margaret was right. The collapse exposed a lower crypt beneath the chapel, sealed off by rubble and soil for… well, we’re still dating it, but likely since the High Middle Ages. Maybe earlier. Romanesque stonework. Anglo-Saxon patterns on some of the capitals. And something else.”

The way he said that last bit made me look up. “Something else?”

He leaned forward, lowering his voice like he was telling me a dirty secret. “An object. A kind of… disc. Stone, about three feet wide. Set into the floor. Black glass at the centre. Very old. Very strange.”

My skin prickled. Not from excitement, but from that ancient little voice in the back of my head that occasionally warns you when something’s off. The kind of thing that tells you not to go into the dark room, even if the light switch is right there.

“That’s all I’m saying tonight,” he added, smug as anything. “We’ll go see it tomorrow morning. Site’s been sealed up for the night, and Margaret has the keys. You’ll meet her too. She’s quite the character.”

I didn’t press. I knew that look in his eyes. He was enjoying this too much to spoil the game. So I took a biscuit and let the taste of lemon and ginger pull me back into the room, pretending—for the moment—that I wasn’t suddenly aware of how very far from home I was. I retired to my room as midnight approached. There was only so much of Stewart’s over-enthusiasm I could take in an evening. The room creaked softly as I moved. *Old timber bones*, I told myself, nothing sinister. But I found myself glancing toward the curtains more than once, wondering if I’d imagined that strange darkness outside. The absence of light in the other houses. The stillness.

Maybe it was just the rain.

 

My arrival into the next morning was heralded by the sharp, needle-like tone of my alarm. I groaned as I turned it off, glancing at the time. 5:30. It was still dark outside. The effort to force myself to the bathroom to shower would have put Hercules to shame, but I managed to bring myself beneath the warm water, washing the cobwebs of the previous night away. Stewart was already downstairs in the kitchen when I descended, chatting in that annoyingly chipper way of his to Judy, who was busying herself at the stove over a pan of bacon and eggs. The smell seemed to revive me fully, and I must admit, the breakfast was very pleasant indeed. I had barely touched my coffee to my lips when Stewart dived right into the business of the day.

“So, Matthew. We’ve been granted access to the collapse site until midday. Margaret said she’ll meet us there at 6:30, so finish up quickly and grab the tool bag. It’s going to be an exciting morning!”

“Why only till midday?” I asked as I forced down the mug of bitter instant coffee.

“Well, they need the time for cleanup. The emergency services still need to stabilise the surrounding buildings and to carry on getting the rubble out. We won’t be alone, though. Margaret and the rest of the Historical Society will be there to help with cataloguing and note taking. They’ve even given us a shovel.”

“Lucky us.”

He hadn’t noticed the sarcasm in my voice, or had at least chosen to ignore it. “Now, I’d best get my supplies. Don’t dawdle, lad.”

We left soon afterwards, the first signs of the sun straining above the overcast horizon. In the daylight, the street didn’t look nearly as creepy—just quiet, like it was holding its breath. The houses here were a mix of the old Victorian dwellings like the Carters’, as well as more modern red-brick terraces built during the Sixties and Seventies, but everything still seemed so grey. We took the most direct route to the collapse, along the clifftop promenade at the end of the road to the right, the colourless sea to our left. I looked over the railings, spying an empty beach strewn with dark seaweed far out across the flats.

“Low tide by the look of it,” Stewart said, almost reading my mind. “Good thing too, makes our job much easier without the sea coming in.” Seagulls moaned and called out across the windy air, the breeze carrying with it that same sour-salty scent I had noticed the night before. Despite the grey streets and Stewart’s endless chatter, I couldn’t shake the weight in my stomach. Excitement? Dread? Maybe just the coffee.

As we approached the seafront, I noticed how the buildings seemed to get much older. Nearly everything here was from the mid-Victorian era by the look of them: painted white and once-bright colours that had been faded to pastels by the sea air over many years. Peeling paint, blank windows, and water-stained signs gave each one the look of a forgotten relic from a colder, wetter decade. One of the most distinctive features, however, were the remains of what looked like more modern structures sticking out of the ocean like the bones of a long dead monster. Thanks to the low tide, I saw the remains of a modern road that ran into the sea, no doubt reclaimed over years of climate change and other such calamities. We passed a rundown looking old fashioned arcade, the type of place where kids in the Nineties and early 2000s would spend their days before the true age of the Internet began. Unbelievably, it still looked to be operating. *Maybe the Internet hasn’t reached Whitport yet.*

We turned up a steep hill away from the half-submerged road, arriving at a trio of pubs that straddled a small junction, each more decrepit looking than the last: *The Narwhal, Triton’s Cove* and the *King James*. The road followed up to a large church hall to our right, made entirely out of flint, and to our left, the reason why we were here. I had never seen a disaster site before, but this was beyond anything I expected. Just passed the *King James*, several roadblocks had been erected in front of a large police van, parked across the width of the street. Despite the early hour, the entire junction was thick with people. Police officers, fire fighters, town officials, and no doubt the Historical Society, were all crawling in front of the police van, around twenty in all. I stumbled my way awkwardly through the crowd as I followed Stewart, careful not to nudge anyone with my duffle as I watched him raise a hand to a short woman in a bright parka coat who seemed oddly cheerful for someone standing at the edge of a crater

“Margaret! Pleasure to see you again!”

“Professor Landry! Pleasure’s all mine! Come, come.” The pair shook hands as Margaret led him over to a small pop-up table covered in notes and files. As I approached, I got my first glimpse of the scale of the disaster. Peering behind the police van, I saw that the black tarmac was cracked and buckled in such a way that the surface rippled like waves frozen mid-motion. Looking up, I saw the striking image of the front of St Mary’s Chapel still standing, now nothing but a flint façade against a cloudy, uncaring sky. The roof had disappeared, leaving a bare window hole overlooking the torn road. I couldn’t see the pit from where I was, and my curiosity was interrupted by Stewart’s voice ringing in my ears.

“Ms. Wright, allow me to introduce Matthew Rhodes, one of my finest students and assistants. He’ll be helping me with my research whilst I’m here, so I’m sure you’ll get well acquainted.”

I had to look downwards to meet Margaret’s gaze, her big brown eyes blinked behind a thick pair of glasses. She must have been in her sixties at least, and her wild frizzy hair had been tamed with a makeshift ponytail.

“Absolute pleasure to meet you Matthew! I’m Margaret, head of the Whitport Historical Society, but you can call me Maggie if it suits.” She shook my hand with surprising firmness. I kind of stammered in response, not really saying any real words. Her big eyes looked me up and down, making me feel a tad uncomfortable. While I didn’t mind female attention, there was something so off-putting about it coming from someone old enough to be my mother. I cleared my throat and started over.

“Pleased to meet you, uh, Maggie.”

“Oh, he’s a handsome one isn’t he?” she remarked, her voice carrying into the air with a little too much emphasis. I shifted uncomfortably, my stomach churning with embarrassment. She seemed completely unaware of my discomfort, a trait I was quickly becoming familiar with. “Come now, I was just telling Professor Landry about what we’ve detailed so far. We weren’t able to get access to the site until yesterday, so there isn’t much to go on I’m afraid.”

Despite Maggie’s comment, there were a copious amount of notes and papers detailing the Historical Society’s findings, along with a plethora of photographs, both Polaroid and those open on a laptop that sat at the head of the table. As I set the bag of supplies down, my initial discomfort slowly ebbed away, replaced by growing curiosity. I wasn’t able to make out much of Maggie’s chicken-scratch handwriting, but the photos were most intriguing to me. There were over forty in total, but those focusing on the structural features of this ‘hidden vault’ caught my attention immediately. Stewart had been right; the stonework was definitely reminiscent of other Romanesque churches across the world. The pillars, although aged and in terrible condition, were similar to the spiralling coiled designs of the cloister of the Lateran Basilica in Rome, yet they seemed to have a number of embellishments that I didn’t recognise. They looked almost… organic. The way the carvings spiralled, as if the stone had grown rather than been carved, gave them an eerie, tentacular appearance. They seemed to mimic the form of deep-sea creatures – an octopus, perhaps?

The arches seemed to be made from the same flint as the chapel exterior, apparently quite common for churches in and around Whitport. But the pillar capitals seemed to be made of a strange, glossy black stone that I didn’t recognise, carved with undoubtedly Anglo-Saxon motifs. They were faded, but the camera had been able to make out some fine details of what looked like holy figures standing in a line or a procession, their forms worn but still oddly dignified. One of them, barely distinguishable, seemed to carry a staff topped with something like a flame—or perhaps a wing. Despite my conscious misgivings about my career path, I couldn’t deny how deeply this fascinated me. There was something here—something buried and forgotten. And maybe, just maybe, worth the debt and disillusionment.

“Interesting, really interesting” I said, turning to Maggie and Stewart as if to reassure them that I *did*, in fact, want to be there in some capacity.

“That it is, for sure.” Stewart remarked, a wide grin bursting beneath his moustache. “But that’s not the best part. Have a look at this.” He uncovered a set of five Polaroids from the piles and set them before me.

This was undoubtedly what he had mentioned last night. As I scanned the images, my eyes were met with what looked to be a large circular design etched into the broken floor of the vault, now exposed to the open air. The stone was comparatively clear to the rest of the ruins, with the carvings upon the surface much clearer and easier to identify. The ring of stone was around a metre wide, as Stewart had said, etched with writing in both Latin and what I guessed to be Old English, below which were carving of the same holy figures as on the pillars. Their garb suggested them to be monks of some kind, their hands raised in prayer save for the figure at the head of the line, who held a tall staff topped with flame, like a great torch. At the centre of the disc, there was a large black stone, broken almost perfectly in half by the great crack that cleaved the disc in two.

“This is the glass you mentioned?” I asked, pointing to the last image.

“Exactly, my boy. At least, we think it’s glass. We haven’t removed anything from the site yet for analysis. Which,” he hefted his supply bag with a satisfied grunt, “is why we’re here. Let’s go, time’s a-wasting.”

I followed Stewart and Maggie behind the police barricade, awkwardly shifting my eyes away as Stewart flashed his credentials proudly to the attending officers. I met some gazes of the local emergency services and nodded, but their reaction didn’t put me at ease. Every one of them, regardless of whether they were police, fire brigade or construction worker, averted their eyes and backed away, as if I were the leper in their midst. I didn’t pay it much heed at first, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t make me just a little bit uneasy.

As we were let through, I at last laid eyes upon the true extent of the damage. The cracks in the tarmac were branching from a vast, deep wound in the ground, so wide that the once level street had sunk by almost a foot. The central crack ran through the doors of St Mary’s into open sky, where the floor suddenly gave way to nothing. Despite my best efforts in maintaining my composure, I couldn’t stop a gasp from escaping my lungs at the sight. Where there had once been a tiled floor, only the barest edge of the chapel’s nave had survived. I could see through the broken entrance arch that entire sections of wall had been torn down from the neighbouring buildings (a hair salon and a dangerously cheap Thai restaurant) and that red brick and plaster was mingled with the shattered flint and mortar of St Mary’s. A scaffold had been erected just past the chapel’s entrance, where a man in a high-vis and hardhat ushered us down a flight of makeshift, rickety stairs onto a wooden platform. Another set of stairs continued from there, and I looked around me in quiet awe at the damage.

The cliff had been comprised of chalk and limestone, which made the contrast of the wreckage stark against such a bleak background. Dark flint, twisted wooden beams, tiles and red bricks lay broken and scattered everywhere. Most had been piled up either side of the central rift in the ground, but there was still so much left to do and clear out. It looked like a bomb had exploded beneath the chapel, a gaping crater in the earth that seemed to swallow and devour everything around it. And we were going straight into its jaws.

We reached the bottom of the collapse, Stewart almost falling and twisting an ankle in his zeal to get to this unearthed vault. I looked up as I reached the piles of compacted chalk below the clifftop. The broken façade of St Mary’s pointed towards the bleak sky like an accusing finger, almost condemning the very heavens for allowing such a fate to befall it. It seemed so sad in a way, but the black shadow of the chapel remains above made me strangely uneasy. I felt as if we’d wandered into an open grave, the broken façade the tombstone for some gigantic creature buried beneath. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we’d disturbed something. As if the earth hadn’t simply broken open, but *had been* opened. Stewart’s voice brought me back from my reverie.

“Good heavens, would you look at that! Absolutely incredible!”

I followed his gaze to see a set of four pillars, the same as those in the photos, and my eyes widened with burning curiosity. They were beautiful, wonderfully preserved and still standing strong. I could make out the fine details the camera had missed, every line, every crack, every fluid carving. They truly seemed to be sculpted in the image of a living thing.

“Just amazing aren’t they?” Maggie chimed excitedly. “But this,” she gestured to the stone floor before the pillars. “This is why we called you, Professor.”

I looked down at the ground, Stewart seemingly deciding to abandon what little restraint he had been reining in. Before us lay a huge circular stone, cracked almost perfectly in half across the diagonal, its pale colour seeming almost to shine in the early morning gloom.

“The seal.” I breathed.

Tigers purr like house cats, and for the same reasons. The uplifted ones did, at least. Well, there were differences. Tigers purrs have a resonance and volume that is alarming to the uninitiated, one that a human could feel in their chest from five feet away. To the initiated, it is a pleasant experience, and Nathan was well initiated.

The sound itself was deep, like an old but finely tuned and powerful combustion engine. Nathan had actually ridden in one of those, back on Earth, although it ran on renewable ethanol rather than fossil fuels. He let the sound and resonance wash over him as he tried to regain his perspective.

He had awoken after seven hours of sleep and, for about three minutes, he had not remembered the things that Katherine had told him the night before. The horrible, horrible knowledge that the UEOSC was suppressing for reasons that were both noble and selfish. He knew just how important the treaties that the UEOSC had brokered were to interstellar peace. Neither the Aurealians nor any of the known governments of the Jurassians were signatories of any of those treaties, and yet they were still protected by the non-aggression clauses.

Yosca had effectively tied all of humanity and its uplifted allies up in a knot where they couldn’t help the Aurealians, despite the fact that they had a moral imperative to do so. He understood it was not that the various military organizations which functioned as the UEOSC’s muscle were not unwilling to intervene in the conflict, it was that consequences of doing so would be unpredictable and potentially devastating in Yosca space as opportunists exploited the letter of the law for personal gain.

Nathan was not a lawyer, politician, or mediator. He didn’t even know why he was here! He’d washed out of the ESF marine program after a year and a half of training when he had realized that he couldn’t overcome his phobia of dying in stasis. He’d never even technically been a soldier, he’d been completing the mandatory education modules which would qualify him for basic training. Then a representative of the UEOSC had -

""That son of a bitch! I don’t know how, but he fucking planned it that way!""

""What exactly has your panties in a bunch now?"" Tony asked, lifting his head and rubbing it against Nathan’s chest like the giant Death-Kitten that he was. Geneticists had never been able to alter either feline or canine vocal structures to be capable of human speech, but with brain scanning technology such things were unnecessary. Tony never stopped purring to ask his insensitive question, his synthetic voice came from a speaker in his collar which interpreted the augmented language regions of his brain for him.

""The Old Man. He – dammit, I don’t know what he did, but he set me up somehow. I’d say that I’d punch him in the face the next time I see him, but considering that his face is completely silicone and steel I’d just be hurting my hand.""

""Your ‘Old Man’ is a plotter, but he is a good man. Perhaps he orchestrated certain events to lead you in the direction he wished for you to go, you will have to ask him. I do not think he will deny it if you do, and then he will explain his reasons. I suggest you listen before you take further offense.""

""Fuck you, Tony, why do you have to be so reasonable?"" Nathan grumbled. He continued to scratch Tony in all of the right spots to show that he didn’t really mean anything by his words. ""And I’m still mad at you for your part in hiding things from me.""

""We are friends, Nathan, but we see the world very differently. Honestly, in my eyes, I do not understand why you are so outraged by the things you learned last night. Those things do not bother me the way they seem to bother you, and I am a little surprised that you came to me so upset.""

""Yeah, well, thanks for listening anyway,"" Nathan told the uplifted Siberian Tiger. ""You’re a real mate.""

""The last thing I want to hear is a human speak to me about mating, Nathan,"" Tony reminded him.

""Oh come on, Tony. Feel the yiff inside you--""

The sudden deep growl that interrupted the purring just made Nathan grin. He kept scratching his friend, and after a moment the purring resumed.

""There’s something I still don’t get, and I’ve been meaning to ask you for a while,"" Nathan admitted.

""I am an open holobank,"" the Tiger answered, leaning into Nathan’s hands.

""You uplifts, the first generation ones at least, you all pick your own names. So why Tony? I mean, you’re literally Tony the Tiger, and that’s like … I mean, it’s --""

""A giant cliché?""

""I was trying not to say that, but yeah. I mean, you could have picked anything, right? So why name yourself after an ancient advertisement cartoon?""

""I don’t really expect a human to understand, not without an explanation at least. Another uplift, perhaps, particularly one from a base species as feared as mine, would see without being told, but sometimes you humans need to have things hammered into your head. I chose to be Tony the Tiger because it’s an ancient cartoon character that is still remembered fondly in much of UEOSC space. It is meant to be reassuring. My appearance alone brings with it a hardwired response in the brains of humans and most of your allied primate races, as well as many of the other uplifts. I don’t want to be feared. Not by my friends and allies. I made my selection carefully, and it was down between Tony and that children’s cartoon character that bounces around on its tail.""

""I suppose me expecting you to jump up on your back legs and emphatically declare ‘They’re Great!’ is somewhat better than expecting you to bounce around talking about how you’re the … sorry, I just got why you didn’t go with Tigger after all,"" Nathan said, his tone becoming somber halfway through. The elevation of great cats was still somewhat controversial. Despite the individual successes of the uplifted specimens, nobody was willing to help them establish a self-sustaining population.

""That is one of the reasons. But I would rather have you think either of those things than have you believe that I am about to pounce upon you and rip out your throat,"" Tony informed him. ""I accept that my people will be feared for some time, that we will face prejudice that the other uplifts did not. I choose to simply be grateful that the elevation of great cats is moving forward at all, even if it is at the snail pace compared to the sprint with which primates and canines were uplifted. I understand why better than you would believe, Nathan, for at this moment I am very aware of exactly how easy it would be for me to kill you.""

Tony’s words shocked Nathan a little, so much that he stopped scratching.

""I would never, of course. You are my friend, and I would die in your defense,"" Tony explained quickly. ""I am simply stating that we both know that I could, and perhaps I am generally more aware of that fact than you are. Assuming that we are both unarmed, the physical contest between us would be a foregone and inevitable conclusion.""

""Yeah, I get it,"" Nathan admitted. He resumed his scratching; Tony had never stopped his race-car-kitten purrs. ""Honestly, it’s not that I don’t think of it sometimes. I just push it down into the back of my head. But now and then it does pop into my head that ‘hey, if he wanted to, he could just tear my arm off and there’s nothing I could do to stop him.’""

""Do you think I have not noticed? You are very easy to read, Nathan. I may be a feline, but I have studied human behavior extensively in my efforts to advance the cause of my people. And I am able to sense and smell fear by instinct, in case you have forgotten. I see it when the fear and the doubt crosses your mind, and I think no less of you for it. It is simply your instincts warning you of a danger that is, in fact, very possible, even though it will never happen. But you try to overcome it, which is why we are friends. In fact, your ‘Old Man’ is my only other visitor who comes in person. The others use holographics when they need to speak with me, and even this disturbs them. But I do not blame them for their fears. I must accept them as they are, as I accept myself and my own people.""

A comfortable lapse in the conversation filled the habitation module. It was not silent, for Nathan did not stop petting, and Tony did not stop purring. Like all of the others, Tony’s module was much larger than it needed to be, designed to house dozens of great cats in comfort. While Tony lacked prehensile hands, clever use of holographics and direct brain interfaces made him a valuable crew member. An absolutely terrifying one in his combat armor with its various weapons added to his natural abilities, even if anyone who actually knew him knew that Tony was, in fact, a giant furrball.

But then again, Nathan had seen his friend eat. Vat-grown meat, true, but it was still somewhat frightening.

""Do you know what I find most amusing of the human’s fear of my people?"" Tony asked after several comfortable minutes.

""What’s that, Tony?""

""Your people fear that making us more intelligent, capable of communicating with you and ourselves, will make us dangerous, an uncontrollable threat to other sapients. And it is true, I am more dangerous than a natural tiger. Perhaps much more, because I possess pattern recognition and long-term planning abilities. However, I still wouldn’t like my chances against a regular human armed with only an iron-tipped spear made of oak.""

Nathan snorted. He wouldn’t want to go up against an uplifted great-cat with anything less than a full jarhead coffin, but he understood what Tony was getting at.

""Yeah, humans are fucking scary.""

""I fear you do not even begin to understand exactly how scary your people really are, Nathan,"" Tony said seriously, lifting his head to make deliberate eye contact. ""All of space is fortunate that you are also moral. With your mastery of science and the rate at which you advanced it, you could have been monsters far worse than the Jurassians could ever aspire to be. Instead of treating your uplifts as peers, you could have treated us as slaves. Rather than seeking to bring peace to the Aurealian – Deathsworn conflict, you could have simply joined the fray and conquered them both. Your ‘Old Man’ laments that man is his own worst enemy, that your internal conflicts continually hold back all of ‘Yosca’ from achieving its true purpose. But it is those very conflicts which keep humanity in check. It is those conflicts which keep the rest of the universe safe from mankind.""

""It is those conflicts which are forcing us to stand idle while innocent Aurealian children are hunted for sport and pleasure,"" Nathan exploded.

""Less than one tenth of the population of Horthus Prime are even allowed to hunt Aurealian. Less than that indulge in the pleasure more than once. You must remember that my morality is different from yours, Nathan, although I know you well enough to understand your outrage. Would you hate me if I told you that I had killed for food and pleasure? Because I have, and I would again if the opportunity arose. And I see no difference between what I have done and the blood sport that the Horthian elite engage in. Does this make you hate me?""

Nathan stopped scratching as he considered how to respond.

""Tigers are apex predators. The geneticists weren’t trying to change that about you when they worked on elevating you and your people. Fuck, Tony, why did you have to make things complicated?""

""To my eyes, things are very simple,"" Tony answered. ""It is you who is overthinking and over-complicating things. But you are human and cannot help it.""

""So how do you see things?"" Nathan demanded. ""Why are you on the Theseus, Tony?""

""Because your Old Man promised to advocate for my people, and because you are my friend,"" came the uplifted tiger’s honest and immediate answer. ""If I can help bring peace between the Aurealians and the Jurassians, that is well. But ultimately my motives are self-serving, and I have no particularly strong feelings towards either of the belligerents.""

Nathan sighed. He gave Tony one last scratch under the jaw, then turned to walk away.

""This is why we make uplifts, you know? It’s not why we started, that was just playing God. But at some point we realized how much we needed to speak with others who didn’t think like us, to help us cut through our own bullshit,"" Nathan said. ""I really hope you get your wish and your people spread throughout the UEOSC, Tony. If they’re all anything like you, then we need them.""

""I am glad that my selfish worldview has helped you resolve your ethical crisis,"" Tony answered as Nathan walked away. The great cat continued to purr, curling up into a comfortable position as his friend walked out of sight.

""Athena, return me to my personal quarters via phase matter transmission with all safety protocols engaged,"" he said once he was out of sight, which was not truly necessary. The PMT relays could pick him up from almost anywhere in the Theseus and deliver it to any other component, but it felt weird to just disappear in front of his friend.

""Confirmed, user Nathan Sawyer to be transferred to personal quarters. Counting down to phase matter transmission. 10. 9.""

Unlike travel with the Aurora Drive, Nathan had never been able to actually feel the PMT working. He knew the principle. It didn’t destroy and rebuild matter elsewhere – no sapient would use such a terrible device to travel if that was the case. It was something to do with quantum tunneling, but Nathan would require two decades of dedicated study to understood how it actually worked. The matter in one location was ‘tunneled’ to a new location in more or less the same state. He knew the limitations; the matter must be within a certain distance of a relay, the relay must be linked with the destination relay, and ‘spin’ was sometimes changed, especially over longer distances. Fortunately the observable difference between the matter that was phased was insignificant in terms of biological process. Quantum electronics could be damaged by PMT, but no effect on sapient life had ever been detected.

Nathan closed his eyes and bent his knees when the countdown reached ""3."" At zero, he fell four inches and, when he opened his eyes, he was in his quarters. He promptly made his way to the mess; he had gone to visit Tony as soon as he had woken and needed to breakfast before long.

He was eating reheated breakfast pastries and artificial sausage when the holoemitter in the table he was sitting at turned on, displaying the disembodied head of the old man.

""Good morning, Nathan. I hope that your visit to Tony helped you clear your head,"" the ghostly mannequin face said.

""Did you get me fucking kicked out of the Marines you asshole?"" Nathan demanded immediately.

The old man chuckled. ""Katherine thought you would put something like that together. No, Nathan. Your reason for washing out was entirely upon you. The ESF marine corps wanted to keep you in a different capacity, however, and I pulled some strings to convince them to release you from duty instead. Your potential was too valuable to Yosca to waste you in a dwindling military that has so many mutual defense treaties that it will never actually be called upon to even defend its own territory from anything other than stray bandits and smugglers trying to plunder earth for cultural relics.""

""And never send more than a token force to any other conflict in UEOSC space.""

""Just so. A single ship filled with a few squads of marines would fulfill their obligations to even their most restrictive treaties, while the moment they call for aide millions of soldiers and thousands of vessels will arrive in Sol space within days, because neither humans, nor our allies, are willing to let earth fall.""

""I don’t think my mother would appreciate you taking me away from the safest military in existence and putting me into the middle of the deadliest conflict we’ve ever seen,"" Nathan commented.

""I think you would be surprised. Did I ever tell you that I’ve spoken with her? More than once, in fact. She confessed to me how your decision to leave your home was both the saddest and proudest moment of her life.""

""Did you tell her you were pulling me into Yosca?""

""She knew who I was. She would know that if I was personally doing background and security checks on a young marine trainee, there would be significant implications to my questions. She did not know what I was recruiting you for, but she believed you would do great things. A belief that I share emphatically with her, Nathan. There were hundreds of thousands of human candidates for this mission, and you are the only one I brought with me aside from Katherine, who has been at my side since her mother was forced to retire from active service.""

""What makes me so damn special, then?"" Nathan demanded.

""Nothing in particular, and everything at the same time,"" came the old man’s infuriating answer. ""Your dedication to non-human sapient rights, military background and training, ability to process and understand new information, and personal morality were all factors, but honestly, the deciding factor was that I made a judgment call. Katherine believes I should have brought veterans from a number of different militaries, but I didn’t want anyone who had actually seen combat before.""

""I’m a rookie? That’s my great qualification? I’m here because I washed out?""

""No, but it’s part of the consideration. A veteran retains the loyalty they had to their previous unit, their military, their government, etc. They would view all of their actions in terms of how they are affecting the lives of the civilians they were sworn to protect, even if they have been officially release from those oaths. You, however, only joined the marines because it was the easiest way for you to leave Earth, and your parting with the ESF was amicable, if not entirely dignified. Your actions do not reflect or impact anyone but yourself and the crew of the Theseus. That is an incredibly important point which would be blurred if we had loaded the ship full of experienced veterans.""

""Right. So you have a greenhorn representing Yosca instead of someone who knows what they’re doing. Great plan.""

The old man’s head was silent for a pregnant moment.

""Oh fuck me,"" Nathan said when he realized the significance of the silence. ""This isn’t even a UEOSC mission, is it? Is this you acting all on your own? That’s why the Theseus is so undermanned and filled with unaffiliated sapients.""

""Yosca knows about our mission and approves. If we succeed, we will be acknowledged and rewarded for our efforts,"" the old man informed him seriously.

""And if we fail?""

""Disavowed. Potentially prosecuted as criminals, depending on the circumstances. It’s hard to predict the fallout when there are so many moving pieces. But that is why your unaffiliation with any established force except the ESF is so particularly important.""

""Because the ESF already washed me out and won’t think twice of disavowing me either,"" Nathan said bitterly. ""And none of its treaty partners would blink.""

""I wish I could put it in better terms for you, but yes. I understand that this is an unfair position to put you in when it is too late for you to back out. Entering stasis until the completion of the Theseus’s mission is still a possible solution for you, Nathan. You would be able to claim innocence in any action you were not a direct part of.""

""I can’t do that and you know it. Not because of my phobia, but because of what I learned last night. I could never look at my mother again if I didn’t try to help you … um, what exactly are we trying to do, Old Man? What can we do?""

""You haven’t figured that out yet?""

""I shipped out on this mission thinking we were just going to do a bit of espionage and bridge building. That was before I learned that intelligent beings are being raised like animals, hunted for sport, and eaten by other intelligent beings. I know what I want to do about it, but it isn’t my call to make.""

""And what do you want to do about it, Nathan?""

""Stop it. Put an end to the atrocities, by any means necessary,"" he said without hesitation.

""Be very careful with those last four words, Nathan. They lead down very dangerous roads,"" the old man warned him. Then he softened as much as Nathan had ever seen the old man soften. ""Since apparently this wasn’t communicated to you last night, I will inform you of the Theseus’s mission for her maiden voyage. Objective number one: observe and document the expected conflict between the Jurassians of the Horthus system and the Aurealian armada designated fleet gamma. Objective number two: make all reasonable attempts to establish a ceasefire and initiate mediation between the aforementioned parties. Objective number three: make all reasonable attempts to limit and mitigate civilian and noncombatant casualties in the aforementioned conflict.""

""You really expect me to try to protect those child-eaters?"" Nathan demanded, disgusted.

""Nathan – for the purpose of Theseus’s mission, all Aurealians on Horthus prime are designated civilians.""

Nathan reeled at the sudden paradigm shift. Protect the Aurealian children, and the nameless who were just living their lives. That was the optimal outcome, was it not? Why had he not realized that sooner?

""How exactly do we keep the Jurassians from killing them?""

""Progress on objective three has already been made. The Rodentia corp is working to disable the cloning facilities producing the Aurealian for the Named Ones to hunt. Our very presence, along with the incoming armada, has caused Horthus to pause the killing in order to maximize the number of hostages he has available.""

""Dammit, why didn’t you explain all of this to me weeks ago?"" Nathan demanded, slamming his fist on the table hard enough that the hologram flickered.

""Would you have come if we had?"" the old man asked, cocking his disembodied head.

""Without hesitation,"" Nathan insisted.

""I believe you. I struggled with the decision of what to tell you and when for a long time, Nathan. I decided to play it this way to keep your personal motivations pure. Your decisions, and your reasons behind them, will be incredibly important not only in the success of our mission, but in controlling the immense fallout that will result from either our failure, or our success. What you know, and when you knew it, may become very important in the future. There are many other things I wish I could tell you, but I have decided that it is better that you do not know. Please, respect my judgment on these matters and operate to the best of your ability with the knowledge that you have available to you.""

""At least this time you’re telling me that the blinders are still on,"" Nathan muttered. ""You don’t want me to predict the fallout of our mission, do you?""

""No. In some ways, a failure would be better than a partial success. Nathan, I know that you hold all sapient life to be sacred. All I ask is that every decision you make is to be made with the intention of the preservation of all sapient life based on the information you have available to you. If you do that, then even if things go ‘tits up,’ you will be able to hold your head high in the fallout.""

""Assuming that I survive that long,"" Nathan argued.

""Yes, assuming we all survive,"" the old man agreed.

Nathan looked down at the table, at his unfinished meal. He was no longer hungry, and he pushed the unfinished food away before drinking the dregs of his coffee. ""So now that I’m up to speed, what’s the real plan? You sent in the rats to destroy the cloning machines, and I agree with that decision. But the Rodentia corps can’t fight, and we don’t have the personnel to protect the Aurealians that are down there already.""

""I believe, at this juncture, the best way to proceed on objective three is to begin work on objective two,"" the old man answered. ""The lead Aurealian scout ship is expected to finish its breaking manuever in two days. The rest of the swarm will follow in approximately six days. Presumably their leaders will be in the second group. We have already launched a stealth relay to attempt to establish contact with both arrivals. In the mean time, I believe it is time for us see Horthus.""

""The planet, the city, or the guy?"" Nathan asked smartly.

The old man smiled, his synthetic face taking on a malevolence that, at his most feral, Tony could never match.

""All three.""

Do you want an AI that can send real emails, search maps, and build websites for you?

Watch the video tutorial below 👇

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUni0ZzvAuI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUni0ZzvAuI)

# The Game-Changing Deep Agent MCP Update

Deep Agent just launched a new MCP update that changes everything about what AI can do for you.

This update lets you connect your AI to 5,000+ tools with just one click. And it only costs $20 a month.

Think about that. For the price of a pizza, you get an AI that can:

* Send and read your Gmail messages
* Create walking tours using Google Maps
* Check code on GitHub
* Build websites and apps
* Connect to WordPress, Facebook, Google Calendar, and thousands more tools

This is what I've been waiting for in AI. Not just a chatbot that gives advice, but a super agent that does real work.

# What Is An MCP And Why Should You Care?

MCP stands for Model Context Protocol. It's the technology that connects AI to your everyday tools.

Before MCPs, AI was stuck in its own world. It could chat with you, but it couldn't touch your real apps and data.

Now, with Deep Agent MCP, your AI can step out of its box and into your real work tools.

This means instead of just telling you how to do something, your AI can actually do it for you.

Send emails? Check. Search maps? Check. Review code? Check. Build websites? Check.

It's like having a virtual assistant that costs $20 a month instead of $2,000.

# The Zapier MCP Method: One Connection To Rule Them All

The most powerful way to use Deep Agent MCP is with Zapier. Here's why:

Zapier already connects to over 5,000 different apps and tools. By connecting Deep Agent to Zapier through MCP, you give your AI access to all those tools at once.

Here's how to set it up:

First, go to [abacus.ai](http://abacus.ai) and select Deep Agent in the bottom left.

Next, go to [mcp.zapier.com](http://mcp.zapier.com) and create a new MCP server.

Add the tools you want to use. Start with Gmail, Google Maps, or whatever you use most.

Copy the server URL from Zapier.

Paste that URL into Deep Agent's MCP settings.

That's it! Your AI can now use all those tools directly.

I set this up in just a few minutes. Now I can say ""Find emails from Julian Goldie"" and my AI handles it automatically.

# Real Examples Of What Deep Agent MCP Can Do

Let me show you some practical examples of what you can do once this is set up.

# Email Management On Autopilot

I typed: ""Use the MCP server to find me emails sent from Julian Goldie""

Deep Agent connected to Gmail through Zapier, searched my inbox, and pulled the relevant emails.

No more wasting time sorting through hundreds of messages. My AI does the searching for me.

I can also ask it to draft replies, organize my inbox, or find specific information from past emails.

This alone saves me at least an hour every day.

# Creating Custom Walking Tours With Google Maps

You can connect Google Maps by setting up the Google Maps MCP with your API key.

Then just ask: ""Find the top rated coffee shops within a mile of downtown. Create a walking tour to visit the best three.""

Deep Agent will:

* Find all coffee shops in the area
* Check their ratings and reviews
* Choose the best ones
* Create an efficient walking route
* Show you maps and details for each place

Perfect for exploring new cities or planning client meetings.

# GitHub Code Review With Deep Agent MCP

For developers, this is amazing. Connect GitHub to your Deep Agent.

Then ask: ""Analyze the PR in the MCP backend integration. What core changes were made?""

Your AI pulls the code, reviews the changes, and explains what's happening in simple terms.

It's like having a senior developer check your code 24/7.

# How Deep Agent MCP Compares To Hiring A VA

Let's compare Deep Agent MCP ($20/month) to hiring a virtual assistant ($2,000/month):

Deep Agent MCP:

* Works 24/7
* Never gets tired
* Follows instructions exactly
* Can connect to 5,000+ tools
* Costs $20/month
* Sets up in minutes

Virtual Assistant:

* Works limited hours
* Needs breaks and time off
* May misinterpret instructions
* Limited by their skills
* Costs $2,000/month or more
* Takes weeks to train

The choice seems clear. Deep Agent MCP can't do everything a human VA can do, but for many routine tasks, it's faster, cheaper, and more reliable.

# Deep Agent MCP vs. Other AI Tools

I've tested all the major AI tools. Here's how Deep Agent MCP compares:

Claude has MCPs, but you need the $200/month Max plan. Deep Agent is just $20/month.

GPT has plugins, but they're limited to what's in their store. You can't just connect any tool you want.

Other AI tools are working on similar features, but they're not as open or affordable yet.

Deep Agent with Zapier MCP gives you more freedom to connect any tool. And it's much more budget-friendly.

The only downside I've found is speed. Sometimes it takes a few seconds to get results. But for the power you get, it's worth the wait.

# Setting Up Your Own Deep Agent MCP System

Want to try this yourself? Here's what you need:

1. A Deep Agent account (about $20/month)
2. A Zapier account (they have a free plan to start)
3. API keys for any specific tools you want to use

The setup is simple. Create your MCP server on Zapier, copy the URL, and paste it into Deep Agent's settings.

Start with one or two tools to get comfortable. Then add more as needed.

If you need help, watch my tutorial video again where I show every step in detail.

# What Can You Build With Deep Agent MCP?

Once your Deep Agent is connected to your tools, you can build some amazing systems:

* An email management assistant that categorizes, summarizes, and drafts responses
* A content creation system that researches, writes, and posts to your website
* A customer support bot that answers questions using your knowledge base
* A project management assistant that tracks tasks across multiple tools
* A research agent that finds, analyzes, and summarizes information

I'm using Deep Agent MCP to automate parts of my SEO business. It's saving me at least 10 hours every week.

# The Importance Of Quality Control

One important note: Always check what your AI does before it goes live.

Deep Agent is powerful, but it's not perfect. When it sends emails or posts content, review it first.

I build quality control into all my AI workflows. The AI drafts, I approve, then it goes out.

This small step saves you from potential problems and ensures everything meets your standards.

The stimulant dissolved under Nathan’s tongue. He was approaching his limit before his mind would be affected by the carefully balanced drugs in the thin wafer, but he couldn’t sleep now. Not now that he knew. The official and the unofficial version of the Aurealian – Deathsworn conflict that he’d been taught were both fabrications.

The fact that he had spent his life believing lies about the only two non-earth origin sapients known to exist, and the sources of their conflict, filled him with rage. But at the same time, he understood why the deception was necessary. Why the UEOSC lied about what it had been told by the belligerents, and about what it knew from other methods.

This war between aliens was an existential crisis for the UEOSC. Yosca was not a sovereign government. It was an organization dedicated to peace and the preservation of life, but it passed no laws, nor did it enforce them. That was the role of its allied military forces, of which the ESF was just one of many.

That the UEOSC possessed a weapon like the Theseus was pushing the boarders of several interstellar treaties, which Yosca itself had brokered. It’s modular nature was not only a feature of redundancy, it was a method of skirting several key provisions which had been put in place to limit the council’s power by classifying each module as a separate vessel.

Which, to be fair, they technically were.

""How are you feeling?"" Katherine asked him, showing actual emotional concern for him for once. It wasn’t that she was typically unfriendly. She was just so professional to the point where she came off as an ice queen most of the time.

""It’s a lot to take in. I get why I wasn’t – why nobody knows the truth.""

""Oh, people know. The right people,"" she answered. ""Representatives of all of the UEOSC’s military alliances have been briefed in full.""

""Then why the fuck! Why is nobody doing anything about it? It’s easy to just fucking say ‘they’re not Earth origin so our hands are tied,’ but if the people knew half of the shit you just told me there would be violence in the streets. People would be lynching polit--""

""That’s exactly why this knowledge is so tightly controlled, and why nobody is doing anything about it,"" Katherine answered gently. She reached out to grip his hand in a surprisingly human gesture. She was actually in the room with him this time, she had jumped over to his habitation module to read him in personally. ""Try to predict the consequences of what you just said in terms of lives lost. Human lives, Aurealian lives, and Jurassian lives. Then remember the UEOSC’s express purpose for existing.""

Nathan suppressed his knee jerk reaction and actually followed the various chains of logic in his head. Despite the fact that his genome was largely unmodified, he was fairly intelligent. The brainjack helped him with numbers when he needed it, but for logic and moral questions, he relied entirely on his upbringing.

""People would lynch their politicians if they refused to act,"" he said after a moment. ""Fuck. Half of the colonies out there are already powder kegs ready to explode as they try to stride the balance between human rights and the rights of other sapients. The protests to get their governments and military forces to help the Aurealians would turn into riots, and people – people of all species – would die in the violence. Fuck, the death toll would be terrible if the more obstinate and oppressive governments dragged their heels.""

""That’s part of it,"" Katherine agreed.

""And almost all of the military forces have signed a non-aggression treaty,"" Nathan realized. ""They’re authorized to deal with piracy and criminal actions only. But the Jurassians aren’t human, according to their laws and customs they’re doing nothing wrong. If one force attacks them, they can approach all of the rest of them and claim that their rights were violated. Fuck, I’ll bet the legal web of treaties is so damned convoluted that it would take decades of legal work to figure out a justification not to defend the Jurassians with all available force, including against the Aurealians.""

""That’s another part. Every interstellar treaty would have to be rewritten. The truth is that we’ve already started the process of doing exactly that, but you don’t need the details. Most of the treaties covered a first contact situation, but none of them were prepared for two alien sapients engaged in a war of extinction,"" Kathy informed him. ""A host of aliens hostile to human life? We were prepared for that. Aliens which outclassed us technologically? We’d thought of that too. But this particular situation landed in a legal blind spot. Our best course of option is to invite both belligerents into the UEOSC and mediate a peaceful solution, but the Jurassians won’t agree to a ceasefire, and the Aurealians can’t. The most aide we can legally provide either side is humanitarian efforts, and the protection of significant population centers.""

""And Horthus Prime is a significant population center, which means we’re legally required to protect it. Fuck! Do we really have to protect the bad guys?""

""We have to protect Horthus Secondary too,"" she said sadly. ""Although that protection extends only to weapons of mass destruction which will inflict significant casualties to non-combat personnel. We’re not obligated to defend military installations. Hell, the Aurealians can mass drive their cities from orbit provided they give the civilians sufficient time to evacuate and prepare.""

""The fucking Horthians are eating people down their, and you’re telling me that we are legally obligated to protect them because they don’t see why such actions are morally reprehensible?"" Nathan exploded.

""That is not what I said, Nathan. I said that we cannot let the Aurealian fleet target the Horthian civilian population. That is the limit of our legal obligation. And there are other factors which you have not considered. You still haven’t figured out the Theseus’s true mission. Take a moment to compose yourself and think about what I’ve told you. You’re tired and overwhelmed. Jon told you that this mission is morally just, and I stand by that statement with every fiber of my being. Jon has been waiting for this opportunity for decades. History will either remember us as disavowed criminals, or heroes responsible for bringing the longest and deadliest war known to human history to an end.""

""Fuck!"" Nathan exclaimed, but he didn’t ask any follow up questions, not yet. Instead he went into the mess, where he poured himself a cup of coffee. The stimulant he’d taken earlier contained some caffeine, but the blend of chemicals meant that there wasn’t very much, and a cup of joe felt like a good idea to calm his mind.

""I’m just a fucking kid,"" he whispered to himself. ""The old man’s talking about changing history, setting precedent that might affect all of humanity and its allies, present and future. And He’s asking a fucking nineteen year old kid who washed out of the ESF because he has a fucking phobia of dying in stasis to help him. Fuck, I just came along to get a ride in a cool fucking spaceship. I am so far out of my depth here that I’ll have to worry about explosive decompression if I even try to swim to the surface.""

The coffee helped. It was good coffee. Not grown on earth, but one of the many garden worlds that exported vast amounts of food to other colonies struggling to reach self-sustainability. It was better than the coffee he remembered drinking on earth, before he’d abandoned his childhood home to explore the stars. Was that because the coffee was better? Or maybe his father just didn’t know how to brew a good cup? Or could it just be because he’d applied for emancipation at age fourteen and never looked back – except to send messages to his mother – and his tastes had changed in the last five years.

Thinking of home, thinking of his mother, he wished he could ask her advice. She saw things in terms of her religion, true, but she explored secular morality with even more vigor. Reconciling what she saw as ‘God’s law’ with modern philosophy and morality was a passion of hers that Nathan hadn’t really understood when he was younger. He still didn’t, not really, but that was because he didn’t believe like she did. Few people did outside of the commune that Nathan had been born into, and those like it scattered throughout UEOSC space.

It was one of the reasons he had left. The ESF had been his ticket off of Earth. Then the Theseus had been his ticket into Yosca – dammit. He had been so proud when he had sent that message back to his mother. They may believe very different things, but one of the things they agreed upon was their opinion of the UEOSC and its raison d’etre. The Theseus had left before she’d been able to send a reply, but he knew that she would be proud of him. She had disapproved of his joining the ESF to be a foot soldier, but a diplomat of the UEOSC? He had thought at the time that his role was more of that of a spy than a diplomat, but he had carefully phrased his way around that. She could always tell when he was lying, but she would understand if he had to bend the truth. And besides, weren’t most diplomats just spies that announced their movements?

What would she think of all of this? He could really use her advice right now. He’d even be willing to pray with her just to get her opinion.

Either the coffee or thinking of home, and his mother, worked to clear his head. Refilling his mug, and filling one for his companion, he returned to sit at the small table in the dining area. Reserved for officers, a holoemitter was built into the top of it. After the things he had seen there, Nathan would never be able to eat at that table again. Katherine accepted her mug from him, but sensed that he wasn’t ready to speak again yet and respected his wishes.

""Who built the cloning facilities?"" he asked after more than ten minutes of silence. ""Cloning doesn’t seem like Jurassian tech. The way they’re using it might be right in line with their worldview, but the tech itself just doesn’t mesh with what we know about their abilities. Their medicine is crap. How can they have advanced cloning facilities and shitty first aid at the same time?""

""We believe that Horthus Prime, and the other worlds we’ve identified with similar facilities, were originally Aurealian worlds,"" Katherine answered. ""It makes sense when you think of them as methods of increasing their population following initial colonization. Aurealians have three sexes, as you know. A female, and two … well, they’re not exactly both males, but they both contribute genetic information to the child that then gestates in the female, who also contributes equal genetic information. That’s fairly normal for the fauna of their worlds as well, although their plant equivalents use a completely different method of sexual reproduction. But for Aurealians, the female is the bottle neck in establishing a self-sustaining population capable of reproducing without the intervention of technology. All of the Aurealians we’ve identified being produced by the facilities are female. All of them.""

""Makes sense, yeah. Finish the terraforming, xenoforming, whatever you call it, then clone up a bunch of first generation colonists. Must be nice to be in a bachelor’s paradise like that,"" Nathan chuckled.

""Actually, we’re fairly certain that the entire process was automated. The cloning facilities generated the first generation of colonists, yes. Then they would be impregnated with preserved genetic information to establish the second generation. These worlds? They’re old. Tens of thousands of years old, and so are the facilities. It’s amazing that they still work. The Theseus only has an expected operational life of two centuries. Yeah, we can push it beyond that, but the Aurora drive, PMT systems, and other vital tech will be outside of their shelf life. Two hundred years is the point where we expect it’ll be safer to dismantle and recycle it and build a new one than to continue to operate it.""

""So either the Jurassians are maintaining, or the ancient Aurealians really built their shit to last,"" Nathan guessed.

""Basically, yeah,"" she agreed.

They both paused to sip their coffees. They both took it black and unsweetened.

""So, the timeline of the war as we’ve figured it out is as follows: the ancient Aurealians sent out a bunch of automated colony ships, which xenoformed worlds throughout the conflict zone tens of thousands of years ago. They do their thing for a while, but then the Jurassians show up and decide that Aurealians are absolutely delicious. The fact that they’re intelligent – I mean, they BUILT WORLDS by remote control for fucks sake – is irrelevant to their sense of morality. For some reason their technology is almost perfectly on par, but Aurealians suck at thinking like warriors, so their weapons systems lag behind while the rest of their engineering is superior to the Jurassians, putting them more or less in a stalemate. At some point the Jurassians chase the Aurealians off of a bunch of the worlds they’d colonized and, what’s far worse, they figured out how to operate the facilities used to populate the colony in the first place.""

""That’s a fairly accurate summary, but it’s missing a few details,"" Katherine said. ""Nathan, the Jurassians didn’t come out of nowhere. We’ve located their home world. That’s exactly why we’re calling them the Jurassians. The scientists studying it say that the flora is extremely reminiscent of that of the Jurassic era on earth. The fauna differs, but there are multiple families of animals which resemble the Jurassians’ basic appearance and physiology. Multi-pigmented semipermeable skin like an amphibian from earth, skeletal structure similar to avians or reptiles, although very few things on their world are capable of flight, and those are insect equivalents. The Jurassians are everywhere, an estimated population of three point six billion, which is pretty impressive considering their dietary restrictions and their technology level.""

""The Deathsworn have FTL. Yeah, it’s just skip drives, but if they can figure that out then--""

""Nathan, you don’t understand. The heavy-world Jurassians are late iron age at best. And the eggheads are fairly certain that they could never develop a method of space travel without outside intervention.""

Nathan jerked in surprise, almost spilling his coffee. ""But they did. They have an entire armada. Maybe they just let their home world return to nature, like we’re doing with Earth.""

""Did they? Do they? Are they? Or are they just using the advanced technology of another race which they managed to figure out how to operate? Nathan, Ulessa – That’s the local’s word for their planet, at least in the predominate language – Ulessa is a Super Earth. One point nine times earth gravity. The rockets humans used during the early space exploration might not have even gotten off the ground, let alone achieved escape velocity. We have PMT, so orbit-to-surface is trivial when we already have ships in orbit. But we’re restricted to land drones and ultra-light aerial surveilance drones. We’re pretty certain that air travel will never be a thing on Ulessa unless we introduce it to them ourselves, but so far we’re in observation mode only. The Jurassians on Ulessa, they have no idea about the Deathsworn or the Horthians or any of the atrocities that their cousins are committing throughout the conflict zone. They hide from our aerial drones because they believe it’s unnatural for things not to touch the ground. More than unnatural, it’s a sign of the apocalypse. Their world has multiple impact craters, many of which are geologically recent. They’ve been hit before, and they remember it.""

""And we’re certain that isn’t why they lost their tech?"" Nathan asked.

""There’s more,"" Katherine explained. She stared at the dregs of her coffee gone cold, then set the mug aside. Waving her hand, she activated the holoemitter embedded in the table. With a few swipes and motions, she brought up the information she wanted.

""The Jurassians are more or less like us genetically. DNA based, although their genetic alphabet is different. Sexual reproduction with two sexes, two pairs of twenty eight chromosomes. We have hundreds of Deathsworn genetic profiles from the action on the Elizabeth, and it wasn’t hard to gather a comparative number of samples from the Ulessians.""

As she spoke, the hologram showed what he vaguely representative of the chromosomes in question, paired up and arranged by size. As her explanation progressed, the representation suddenly cloned itself, with a label on top indicating ‘Ulessian’ and the one beneath indicating ‘Jurassian.’ Nathan had no trouble following along with her, the differences between uplifts and native species were generally explained along the same terms.

""The Jurassians, the spaceborn species, is clearly related to the native Ulessians,"" she explained. ""Yet the eggheads say that while the Ulessians evolved naturally, the Jurassians had the blue areas of genetic information added to their DNA.""

About ten percent of the Jurassian DNA lit up in little bands of various thickness.

""At the same time, the Ulessians possess a significant amount of DNA material which the Jurassians lack, indicated in red,"" she continued.

Almost thirty percent of the Ulessian chromosomes lit up, again in bands of various thickness.

""It’s mostly junk or detrimental DNA that’s missing, but there’s also a number of proteins and enzymes which are replaced by the blue insertions. Except they’re not the same. How’s your biochemistry?""

""I washed out of the Marines, ma’am,"" he reminded her. ""I joined when I was seventeen after three years of cramming to meet the basic education requirements. Before that I was in an anachronistic Christian commune. Some of my friends growing up would curse you out just for trying to explain genetics to me.""

""Right. Sorry. Well, excluding the red DNA that’s useless or detrimental, all of the red DNA that was replaced with blue versions serve basically the same function, but with different proteins, or different chirality, or, well, honestly I don’t understand it myself. Not well enough to explain it properly, at least But here’s the thing, Nathan. We’re pretty certain that those changes were made specifically to allow the Jurassians to eat fauna not native to Ulessa. In fact, we’re pretty certain that most of the Jurassian diet would be poisonous to an unmodified Ulessian. Without those modifications, a Jurassian could not eat Aurealian flesh and survive.""

Nathan allowed the information to sink into him for a few moments before exhaling a punctuating ""Fu-uck. And we don’t think that the Jurassians did it to themselves, do we?""

""We do not,"" Katherine agreed.

""So what do we think? Because I’m barely keeping up at this point, to be completely honest.""

""There are several competing theories,"" Katherine informed him. ""One is that the modifications to the Jurassians were made by the Aurealians. The technology they would need for such a thing is only a step beyond the cloning facilities that we’re attributing to their ancestors. The war and resulting migration of their peoples explains why such technology, and even the knowledge that they possessed it, would be lost.""

""So the leading theory, if I’m understanding you right, is that this entire war, which we have estimated to have cost billions, if not trillions, of lives … The Aurealians did it to themselves? Why would they do that? Why would they take an apex preditor, make it able to eat them, and then teach it how to fly their space ships?""

""As I recall, you and Tony are fast friends,"" Katherine pointed out. ""The changes to the Jurassians were changes of metabolism, not intelligence. Tony is a gentle soul, but his increased intellect makes him far more dangerous than any of his man-eater ancestors.""

""Man-eater is a no-no word around Tony,"" Nathan reminded her. ""And he wouldn’t speak with you for weeks if you even suggested he was related to one, no matter how distantly.""

""Sorry, but I was making a point.""

Nathan could only shrug. He knew what she meant, but it was hard for him to imagine Tony as anything other than his friend, a friend she had just insulted. ""So, the Jurassians are uplifts gone rogue? That’s what we think?""

""Not exactly."" She sighed and scratched her temple, right about where Nathan’s brainjack was, except that Katherine’s brain was all natural. ""The Jurassian and Ulessian culture and social structure is very similar. The Ulessian have Unnamed making up the majority of their population, with Named individuals of importance, and when they go to war they swear an oath mostly equivalent to the Deathsworn. Aside from that, Ulessa is actually quite a bit like iron age earth, with tribes, city-states, and nations of various sized, usually led by an individual of prominence such as Horthus. Travel is severely limited, which explains why the Jurassians have a comparatively monolithic structure that stretches entire star systems while Ulessa is divided against itself like … well, like us. Even now, we’re still split into thousands of different camps. The UEOSC focuses on interstellar relations, but if you actually look at it human politics are exponentially more complicated than that even without getting into inter-species relations.

""But aside from those slight differences in social structure, they show no marked differences in intellect. Vast differences in the available technology, but to be honest, we’re not much smarter than cavemen either. We just have better education and access to technology they couldn’t dream of.

""The Aurealians, if it was the Aurealians who modified the Jurassians, did not try to elevate the Ulessians as we tried to elevate our friends and allies from earth. They simply made the Jurassians capable of eating different foods.""

""I still don’t understand why the Aurealians would build themselves an apex predator that actually eats them,"" Nathan protested.

""We don’t think that was their intention. Not for the Jurassians to eat the Aurealians themselves. We think they were trying to make them able to survive on the fauna that the Aurealians brought with them from wherever they came from, and at some point the Jurassians realized that they could eat the Aurealians as well, and that evolved into the situation we face now.""

Nathan considered the explanation. ""That still doesn’t explain why they would do such a thing. Why not just leave the Ulessians alone?""

""We think this is why,"" Katherine explained, interacting with the hologram again. The genetic information vanished, and after swiftly shifting through the directory she brought up an image of a planet. Text at the bottom identified it as Ulessa. It looked surprisingly earth like, unlike most potential colony worlds until the late stage of terraforming. With oceans, vast lakes and river systems, and vast swaths of greenery and occasional deserts, it could be mistaken for earth if you didn’t pay attention to the twisting shapes of its continents. The image itself didn’t give a sense of scale, after all.

""Here,"" she said, pointing towards one of the land masses. The hologram zoomed in on one of the landmasses, but remained in an aerial orbit. It took Nathan a moment to understand what he was looking at.

""A crater? Isn’t that sort of normal for Super Earths? I mean, they have all that gravity -""

""We dated it. It’s about seven or eight hundred years old, which predates the beginning of the Aurealian – Deathsworn war by about a century according to our intel.""

""Oh."" Nathan took a moment to process the information.

""What would early human settlers have done if we’d found peers out there among the stars? Like us, but different. Intelligent tool users, but technologically primitive. And as soon as we learned that they existed, we realized that they were living on borrowed time, that their Armageddon Clock was ticking down.""

""We would have saved them,"" Nathan said. ""Tried, at least. Whatever we could do, whatever it took.""

""Exactly.""

""That’s … I can’t even process that,"" Nathan said. ""That’s Shakespearean levels of making Greek tragedy even more tragic, there. And the Ulessians survived the impact, which means that the monsters the Aurealians released upon themselves didn’t need saving in the first place.""

""Yes.""

""Do they know?""

""We haven’t asked. Ulessa isn’t in the charts that we have examined from either Aurealian or Jurassian navigation systems. Whatever the Aurealians tell themselves, however they are coping, it’s not our place. At least that’s the leading thoughts on the matter.""

""Fuck,"" Nathan whispered. He was so far past emotional overload and exhaustion at this point that all he could do was try to understand the information as Katherine shared it with him.

""There’s an alternate theory. One which is both less tragic, and yet more troubling for its larger implications,"" Kathy said after he had been silent for several moments.

""Is it any better than the Aurealians attempting to save a race of doomed sapients only to get ‘et tu, Brutus’ed for centuries?"" he asked

""I’m not certain. The alternate theory is that a third race of xenosapients released the Jurassians upon the Aurealians. Motivation and intentions unknown and unclear.""

Once again, Nathan required time to process. He looked at his coffee mug, then got up and began to leave the mess hall.

""I’m going to take a sedative and sleep. If you have any more nukes to drop on me, you can do it when I wake up.""

1kl3f75,https://i.redd.it/v5g9x4vvwe0f1.png,Fellow pilots: help us save an Airfield in the Italian Alps!,"Note: I got in touch with mods a few weeks ago to ask for permission to post this. I hope this kind of posts are not a nuisance.

European pilot here. I regularly fly in and around the Alps, and I wanted to raise awareness about something that’s happening in northern Italy, a small but lovely airfield, **Costa Volpino** is at serious risk of being shut down for the worst reasons possible: greed!

The local administration has been **actively trying to shut it down**, despite the fact that the airfield is in an **industrial zone** and has been a peaceful part of the aviation community for years. Authorities have **harassed the operators with unjustified police visits**, citing noise complaints that don’t hold up given the zoning (industrial area) and long-standing nature of the airfield.

Now, since they can’t win the fight through existing rules, they’re **changing the zoning regulations** to push the airfield out of operation... all to open up the area for (you guessed it) **real estate development**.  
  
Iseo Lake is in fact a wonderful touristic lake (just East of Como lake!) and prime real estate material.  
But other than that it's also an historical location for the aviation industry and the golden age or pioneers of the air. Places like this inspired some locations in Hayao Miyazaki's **porco rosso** movie , the nearby Garda Lake (where Caproni flew his planes and where the piece of art that is the Macchi MC72 set ,in  1939, the word speed record for a seaplane at 709km/h... still standing today!) have always been a spot for plane lovers.

This airfield is **free to land at**, and has been **instrumental for mountain flying, bush flying, paragliding, ultralight aircraft, and other air sports in the area** for a long time.   
You need a safe harbor to stop during the traversal of the alps? You land there and the owner will offer you a coffee and a comfy recliner to relax in the breeze of the Alps.

The situation has caught the attention of **AOPA Italy**, and the petition to save the airfield has been signed and shared by many GA pilots across Europe.

While I know r/flying has a primarily US audience, I believe this reflects a **global pattern:** small fields being squeezed  real estate development and bureaucracy. It’s a topic I think many here can relate to.There’s a **petition going around** to try to stop this. If you’ve flown in Italy, plan to, or just care about preserving access to airfields like this, I’d be super grateful if you’d **sign and share**:

1kl3ev2,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1kl3ev2/green_card_interview_experience/,Green card interview experience,"On Friday of last week at 10:25 am, my husband and I’s green card interview was scheduled. We arrived 25 minutes before and waited for two and a half hours. We enter with a lot of energy and excitement and by the end we were both cranky, hungry, needed coffee and just lost energy. 

Anyways, we saw maybe 50+ people go in before us, each couple were called by one officer.

When our turn came, two female officers called for us and that on it’s own was intimidating, why two? Is that normal?

We enter and get asked about documents, what we had specifically and to give them every thing we had with us. And so we did. 5 minutes later they ask us to stand up and do the swearing ritual thing which i didn’t know happens.

They started their questioning by asking my husband a ton of questions followed by details on, how & where we met, who introduced us, their name, how did he ask for my number, how did we go on a second date, if he has met my family and how often, all things like that. 

They start asking me questions ( i think it’s a procedure ? ) about if i ever broke the law, and all legal-related questions, maybe 10+ of them.

The interview ended 20 minutes later or so, saying that their system is down today and people will expect delays.

Nothing was reassuring, their poker faces got me confused and intimidated.

Has anyone been interview by not just one but two officers before? We have not a done a single thing that’s suspicious and i was hoping to get asked more questions to prove how much in love my husband & I are and this is very legit, but oh well. ",3,1747082522.0,USCIS,6,0.8,False

Today, they can cost you $10 to $15 a month - with commercials. Our family had one small television, no personal smartphones,and no computers or Internet fees. We only paid for a movie when we went out and saw one, and there were no such thing as streaming channels we have to pay for even if we don't use them. 

The only things you could get by delivery were milk, pizza and Chinese, and our dads or moms would usually pick food up on their way home from work to avoid a delivery fee. There were monthly fees and subscriptions for very little other than magazines or maybe the ""book of the month"" club. Today, there are monthly fees for toothbrushes, makeup, razors and shaving materials, pet food, doorbell camera monitoring, vitamins, music streaming services, prepared food ingredient kits, underwear, you name it.

————————
Evidence
Paul and I had been together for over ten years,building a business,planning a future,and getting ready for the wedding of our dreams.But one click changed everything.
I stumbled upon a shared document in his Cloud Drive-a document that wasn't meant for me.It was filled with secret rendezvous plans,love notes,and hotel receipts.
The worst part;he was doing it with my trusted employee,Claire Winslow.In that moment,something inside me snapped.
Our perfect life?A lie.Our business?No longer his.And this wedding?It wasn't going to be canceled-it was going to be the start of their downfall.
I wasn't the heartbroken fiancee who would quietly walk away.No,I would take everything.Brick by brick,I would destroy them both.They thought they could cheat and get away with it.They had no idea who they were messing with.
I was knee-deep in wedding planning,juggling work while preparing for the biggest day of my life.
One evening,as I finalized our wedding invites,I shared the guest list with my fiance,Paul Foster,on Cloud Drive.
He was away for a business conference,so this was our way of staying organized.
Everything seemed perfect-until something strange caught my eye.
A few days ago,he logged into his email on my laptop,so today I accidentally opened the drive using his account.
As I scrolled through the folders,I noticed the latest edited document that I didn't recognize.It was titled [Business Projections-Q3.]Boring,typical.But something about it felt off.I hadn't created it,and it wasn't part of any current project.
Curiosity got the better of me.
I clicked on it,expecting a dry business file.
Instead,it opened to a short message:
[Can't stop thinking about that night at the hotel...next time I'll wear red]My stomach dropped.This wasn't some business document.It was shared with only Paul and this email I had never seen before:Cl_win@wemail.c-om.Something was definitely off.
Shaking,I checked the document history.
The full conversation unraveled before me
-talk of sneaking around after meetings,making excuses for""work dinners,""and even plans to continue their affair after the wedding,like it was just a bump in the road to their perfect little secret.
I stared at the screen,disbelief crashing over me.They had been using our business as cover for their affair,planning romantic weekends while I had been pouring my heart into our future.
The document wasn't even hidden.He had gotten so comfortable,so careless,that he didn't bother to erase the evidence.
-
And now,here it was in his shared folder,staring me in the face like a twisted gift from the universe.
""Hey,sorry,Ruby.I can't make it today.
Can you do the food tasting with your mom?""he said when I called to remind him about our appointment.Same excuse,different day.I bit my tongue and forced a light tone.""Yeah,sure.Just don't overwork yourself,alright?""
As soon as the call ended,I clenched my fists.His time was coming.I would definitely make it happen.
After spending days crying and feeling desperate,I knew I had to do something.I made a ten-step revenge plan,and the first step was to gather evidence.
Without him suspecting a thing,I scoured his phone,emails,and financial records,seeking undeniable proof of his affair.
We had always kept things simple,sharing one WeCloud account for our devices.It was convenient for syncing our calendars,documents,and photos.As I browsed through my phone's photo gallery,I noticed new images had been synced from his device.
Most of them were mundane-screenshots of emails,photos from work trips.But then,mixed in between,I found a photo that didn't belong.It was a picture of Claire Winslow,our employee,in lingerie,posing in front of a mirror in a hotel room.
My chest tightened,and I quickly swiped,hoping it was a mistake.But the next photo was even worse-him,shirtless in the same room,grinning at the camera.This confirmed the affair between the two of them.
Then,one afternoon,while I was working from home and he was supposedly still in a meeting,I opened the Streamify app to play our usual playlist.That was when I noticed a recently added playlist titled [Late
Nights.]It wasn't our music,and it wasn't public.Curious,I clicked on it.
It was filled with romantic songs we had never listened to,with titles like ""Secret Love Song,""""Wildest Dreams,""and ""Dirty Little Secret..""I then saw her profile-Claire-had been adding songs too,with little love notes in the description:[For our weekend getaway,[That night.]I realized they had been secretly sharing songs,creating a world I had no idea about.
The playlist was their own soundtrack to the affair.
It took me a few weeks,as I was busy with work and wedding preparations.But once I had it all-the secret meetings,inappropriate messages,and even hotel receipts-I filed them away for later.My goal was to strike when it would hurt the most.
-
Isolating Taking Over
The second step was to isolate him socially.
I knew that cutting him off from our social circles had to be done carefully-slowly,without raising any alarms.So,I started small,weaving stories into casual conversations.
At brunch with our mutual friends,I would bring up how he had been ""so busy lately.
""Oh,he's been out of town a lot recently,""I would say with a sigh,playing the understanding fiancee.""I get it;he's got work meetings and all,but with the wedding coming up,I wish he could be around more.""
It was the kind of thing that made people sympathetic but also raised a silent red flag.
I played it off,always smiling,as if it were no big deal.But as I dropped these little tidbits,I could see doubt flicker in their eyes.
As the days passed,I continued to paint a picture of a man who was distracted,distant,and maybe even a little unreliable.
When some of his friends,who happened to work with me,asked how the wedding planning was going,I would tell them,""Oh,you know,he's got his hands full with work,so I've been handling most of the details on my own.He's busy flying out for meetings every few days.But that okay-he's stressed;I get it.""
The more I shared these seemingly innocent remarks,the more people started to question his commitment.They would murmur behind his back,wondering why he was leaving me to handle everything alone when our wedding was just around the corner.
Friends would text me to ""check in,""
concerned about how I was holding up.
Some even voiced their doubts,saying things like,""It's kind of weird he's not more involved,don't you think?""
I would laugh it off,acting like the supportive partner,but I knew exactly what I was doing.With each conversation,the seeds of doubt were taking root.Slowly but surely,people began to drift away from him,Some of his""bro""stopped inviting him out for drinks,probably afraid to take more of his time.Others made excuses when he reached out,claiming they were ""too busy'""to meet up.
I wasn't openly accusing him of anything
-that would have made me look suspicious.Instead,I played the role of the devoted fiancee who""understood""why her fiance was so absent.
But behind the scenes,I was gradually turning our friends against him,leaving him isolated,with fewer people to lean on.
In their eyes,I was the patient bride-to-be,doing everything to make the relationship work,while he seemed too preoccupied to care.Little by little,our mutual friends began siding with me,their loyalties shifting as I subtly rewrote the narrative of our relationship.He never even saw it coming.
-
While he was distracted by his affair,I took the opportunity to set the third step in motion,carefully and deliberately taking control of our shared business assets.
It wasn't something that could happen overnight-he was too involved in the business for that.So I played the long game,working behind the scenes while he focused on sneaking around with her.
First,I started with small changes-documents he barely noticed.Whenever we had meetings with our accountant or legal team,I would act as if I was just being thorough,asking to review contracts and paperwork that we had already signed.
He would wave me off,too distracted to pay attention.""You handle it,""he would say,.
shrugging as though our finances were the least of his worries.That was exactly what I wanted.
I made sure I was always the one to handle the paperwork.If there was a contract to sign,I would volunteer to deal with it.
When our accountant sent over forms for investments or property holdings,I would tell him I'd take care of it-making sure to slip in additional clauses or have certain assets quietly listed under my name.
He was so distracted by his affair that he never questioned why I was suddenly so involved in the details.
The key was in the subtlety.I couldn't make any drastic changes too quickly,or he might have caught on.Instead,I slowly began transferring small portions of our shared investments into accounts that I controlled.
When we bought new equipment for the business,I ensured the purchase orders listed me as the sole owner.I even had some of our most important contracts rewritten,making sure my name was on every significant legal document.
To protect myself,I worked with a lawyer he didn't know about-someone who specialized in business takeovers and asset protection.
Together,we built a watertight case,ensuring that if he ever tried to challenge me,I would have the upper hand.I gathered every piece of evidence I needed to prove that the assets were rightfully mine.
As the weeks passed,I took control of the accounts one by one-our investments,our business holdings,even the bank accounts that funded our day-to-day operations.It was a slow,deliberate process.
I made sure not to leave any obvious traces or do anything that would alert him.He was still wrapped up in his double life,too distracted to notice the slow takeover of everything we had built together.
There were moments when he would glance at a statement or bring up a concern about the business,but I always had a quick answer ready.
""""It's all under control,""I would say with a reassuring smile,and he would nod,relieved that I was handling it.Little did he know,I was preparing to take everything away from him.
By the time he realized something was off,it would already be too late.The business he thought we shared would be mine every asset,every investment,and every piece of property that mattered.He would be left with nothing.

Sabotage the Mistress
Claire Winslow wasn't just his secret lover
-she was also one of our longest-standing employees,practically there from day one.
She held a key role in the company,which made things tricky,but also gave me a direct path to ruin them both.If I played my cards right,I wouldn't just take down their affair-I would wreck their careers altogether.
I knew I couldn'tjust expose their affair without consequences,so instead,I focused on systematically dismantling her role in the company,piece by piece.This was the fourth step.
First thing first,I needed to start planting bad seeds.Whenever Claire and I discussed potential business leads or new partnerships,,I would""accidentally""slip her false information.
I told her about meetings with supposed investors who were difficult to work with or potential clients with bad reputations.I always phrased it like it was a tip-off or insider in-fo,so she would not question it too much.
""Hey,Claire,""I would say casually over coffee,""I heard from a contact that there's this huge investor interested in our market.
Maybe it's worth a look?""
Of course,the deals would always fail.The investors I sent her to either were not interested or had a reputation for being impossible to work with.
Claire started fumbling through meetings,looking more and more incompetent in front of the board.Word about her screw-ups spread fast,and she had no idea I was the one pulling the strings.
Nobody called her out directly,but it was clear-she was slowly being iced out.Fewer meetings,no one asking for her input.It was only a matter of time.
But I didn't stop there.While she was busy chasing bad leads,I worked behind the scenes to rally the rest of the team around me.I made myself the indispensable leader,the one who got things done.
Whenever Claire made mistakes,I was there to fix them,stepping in to ensure projects stayed on track.I made sure that the rest of the team saw me as the reliable one-the person they could trust to steer the company in the right direction.",1,1747082194.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

i didn't change my routine or introduce any new product. i was using the same products that helped calm my skin and make it almost acne free (except 1-2 around periods) for four months, which was a huge deal for me because i was breaking out pretty badly last year. 

i don't understand what is causing this. i don't eat sugary foods, limited my coffee, stooped dairy but this time its not working and i feel like this acne breakout is the worse of all. literally visited my hometown two months back for 2 weeks and everybody could see my face looked so much better, but then it started breaking out like crazy in the next month itself.

can't figure out how my skin went from flawless to this crazy in only last month (by which i mean from getting 1 small pimple once in a month to breaking out in terrible pimples like every 5 days) any suggestions why this could be happening ? i am just too tired at this point.

He offered to go out for food/coffee but I refused (due to my eating disorder), so I just came over his place. It took place 5 weeks ago. All we did was smoke weed and make out, I forgot we were actually supposed to talk about how exactly we would take things seriously. Through texts he promised me so many things, not even worth mentioning in this post since they're just words for now. He was leaving the city shortly for like 3 months, and when I was leaving he told me to take care of myself, and I asked ""and when you're back you'll take care of me?"" and he said yes.

1. Most Blues begin, ""Woke up this morning...""

2. ""I got a good woman"" is a bad way to begin the Blues, unless you stick something nasty in the next line like, ""I got a good woman, with the meanest face in town.""

3. The Blues is simple. After you get the first line right, repeat it. Then find something that rhymes... sort of: ""Got a good woman with the meanest face in town. Yes, I got a good woman with the meanest face in town. Got teeth like Margaret Thatcher, and she weigh 500 pound.""

4. The Blues is not about choice. You stuck in a ditch, you stuck in a ditch--ain't no way out.

5. Blues cars: Chevys, Fords, Cadillacs and broken-down trucks. Blues don't travel in Volvos, BMWs, or Sport Utility Vehicles. Most Blues transportation is a Greyhound bus or a southbound train. Jet aircraft and company motor pools ain't even in the running. Walkin' plays a major part in the blues lifestyle. So does fixin' to die.

6. Teenagers can't sing the Blues. They ain't fixin' to die yet. Adults sing the Blues. In Blues, ""adulthood"" means being old enough to get the electric chair if you shoot a man in Memphis.

7. Blues can take place in New York City but not in Hawaii or any place in Canada. Hard times in Minneapolis or Seattle is probably just clinical depression. Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City are still the best places to have the Blues. You cannot have the blues in any place that don't get rain.

8. A man with male pattern baldness ain't the blues. A woman with male pattern baldness is. Breaking your leg cause you were skiing is not the blues. Breaking your leg 'cause a alligator be chompin' on it is.

9. You can't have no Blues in a office or a shopping mall. The lighting is wrong. Go outside to the parking lot or sit by the dumpster.

10. Good places for the Blues:
a. Highway
b. Jailhouse
c. An empty bed
d. Bottom of a whiskey glass

11. Bad places for the Blues:
a. Nordstrom's
b. Gallery openings
c. Ivy league institutions
d. Golf courses

12. No one will believe it's the Blues if you wear a suit, 'less you happen to be a old ethnic person, and you slept in it.

13. You have the right to sing the Blues if:
a. You older than dirt
b. You blind
c. You shot a man in Memphis
d. You can't be satisfied

14. You don't have the right to sing the Blues if:
a. You have all your teeth
b. You were once blind but now can see
c. The man in Memphis lived
d. You have a pension fund

15. Blues is not a matter of color. It's a matter of bad luck. Tiger Woods cannot sing the blues. Sonny Liston could. Ugly white people also got a leg up on the blues.

16. If you ask for water and your darlin' give you gasoline, it's the Blues

17. Other acceptable Blues beverages are:
a. Cheap wine
b. Whiskey or bourbon
c. Muddy water
d. Nasty black coffee

18. The following are NOT Blues beverages:
a. Perrier
b. Chardonnay
c. Snapple
d. Slim Fast

19. If death occurs in a cheap motel or a shotgun shack, it's a Blues death. Stabbed in the back by a jealous lover is another Blues way to die. So is the electric chair, substance abuse and dying lonely on a broke-down cot. You can't have a Blues death if you die during a tennis match or while getting liposuction.

20. Some Blues names for women:
a. Sadie
b. Big Mama
c. Bessie
d. Fat River Dumpling

21. Some Blues names for men:
a. Joe
b. Willie
c. Little Willie
d. Big Willie

22. Persons with names like Michelle, Amber, Debbie, and Heather can't sing the Blues no matter how many men they shoot in Memphis.

23. Make your own Blues name Starter Kit: a. name of physical infirmity (Blind, Cripple, Lame, etc.) b. first name (see above) plus name of fruit (Lemon, Lime, Melon, Kiwi, etc.) c. last name of President (Jefferson, Johnson, Fillmore, etc.) For example: Blind Lime Jefferson, Jackleg Lemon Johnson or Cripple Kiwi Fillmore, etc. (Well, maybe not ""Kiwi."")

24. I don't care how tragic your life: if you own even one computer, you cannot sing the blues.",1,1747081974.0,SexPositiveWomen,0,1.0,False

So I went through a breakup a little over a month ago. To sum up, we had communication issues: I would sometimes get irritated (no strong words but my tone was harsh) and he would shut down for a day, sometimes two. Otherwise things were good and we were in love. After 5 months he broke up with me and said he didn’t think we couldn’t work on our issues. He also said he needed some time apart because it would be too weird to see me, even just for coffee (I usually stay friendly with my exes). I said ok.

I was very, very sad in the beginning. We kept in touch and he told me he wasn’t doing well. He was drinking a lot and wasn’t able to focus on work. This phase lasted about a month. 

Then we both went to a party. That day he asked me if I wanted to grab a drink beforehand but I said I wasn’t available. In reality I was but I was just starting to feel better after a weekend away, and I was afraid to lose all the progress. At the party he came to me and almost right away he said he was feeling better, but had done some thinking and he regretted saying we couldn’t work on our issues. He didn’t directly ask me how I felt about it so I didn’t know what to make of it. Eventually he went to the bar to grab another drink so I joined a group. He joined another conversation and that was basically the rest of the evening. 

The following day I said it was nice seeing him and he said he was glad to see me too. He asked if we could get drinks the following week and I said yes. At that point I thought maybe he wanted to talk but I wasn’t sure. 

We had drinks a few days ago. It was nice and he showed interest in a cause I cared about. His lack of political conscience was an issue for me when we were together (and often why I got irritated). But this time, when I mentioned a demonstration I couldn’t attend because I would be away, he took his phone to save the date and he said he may want to go. I swear that’s not something he would have done before. I wondered if he was showing me he could change but I wasn’t sure. In any case, I like that people care about politics so that’s what counts lol.

He asked me if I went on dates and I didn’t really answer (I did have a date but I didn’t want to talk about it). I asked if he did and he said he had one date the day before, but he wasn’t really interested.

He had to go to work afterwards (he does standup). So we said goodbye. The following days I was wondering if he wanted to get back together with me or if I was projecting. After all he didn’t make any move. But then I felt maybe I had to show him that I was interested because he had no way to know. Although I wish he would just be direct, especially since he was the one breaking up with me. 

So yesterday I asked him if he wanted to go see a movie. He said yes and we went that evening. Afterward we talked about the movie and then he said « I have to go to a friend’s to buy something » I said « you mean drugs » and he said yes. He added « that’s too bad, I wish we could grab drinks ». I said « well yes but you have to go » and we said goodbye. He sent me a message 10 min later saying « sorry it was brief, but it was nice ». I was annoyed because it was very easy to just cancel his thing (even before we went to the movies). I just said « no worries ».

So I’m like, now what? Was I delusional when I though he wanted to rekindle? Or was I right but he just expected me to make a move? What do you think of this whole thing?

I’m kind of nervous but my provider was reassuring. She talked me through next steps if things come back pre-cancerous (a leep). Coincidentally I work in the OR and have done LEEPs and cold knife biopsies on others. I wanted to share my experience with the colpo.

I did it in the office, I did ask for local anesthetic and they gave me topical lidocaine. The acetic acid wasn’t painful for me. She said my cervix was red at 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock so she took 2 biopsies. They didn’t hurt that much for me to be honest. She also did a deeper pap (I forget what she called it) and that was uncomfortable, never had anything in my cervix before lol. I had cramping for the first few hours afterwards, felt like my period. I didn’t bleed a lot after but I wore a pad.

I have since become a -illionaire and am thinking about reuniting with him, but I don't want to derail any progress he's made on himself.

Reddit please help me.
So I have a pretty sizeable amount of moolah making me an -illionaire, gained through various means and investments. Prior to that I was an engineer and dated a really wonderful man who hated himself. We broke it off because he felt completely worthless comparatively to me (I was an engineer and he worked in fast food) and didn't quite have his life figured out. We both lied to ourselves about various things, which in turn lead to inadvertently lying to each other about our own issues we as individuals were facing. But in my opinion nothing major. He broke up with me, but I knew he still loved me and I feel like he did it because he didn't want to hold me back in my own life. He also couldn't give me a real answer as to why, other than I am too chaotic. (He was also super into Jordan Peterson at the time, so I personally took this as some cop out excuse, because like the embodiment of feminine energy is chaos itself so idk if he was telling me I was too much of a woman for him or what exactly). 

I met him through his younger sister (who I went to school with, and I'm still close friends with her). And I know her getting married to another engineer was a source of contention in our relationship, because we were together longer and he just didn't feel ready yet. Since, he has really put forth effort to work on himself and has more of a career and seems to be happier in life. I moved across the country to spend more time with my family and became a -illionaire due to various means and investments. We recently met up when I was visiting his sister, and went out for coffee, he informally proposed to me. (As in he basically told me what a fool he has been, and he asked me to marry him, informally.) Neither one of us have really been with anyone else since. Maybe gone out to dinner, but nothing substantial.

I feel some kind of way. I want to say yes. But I'm also afraid because on one hand I want to reunite with him and try again, and there's a real possibility that could happen. But I also don't want him to just be with me for my money, or feel bad about himself, because I've outpaced him financially, when he's doing significantly better for himself than what he started as. Like personally, I'm prepared to be single for the rest of my life, because I just really feel like he is the one for me. And I know deep down he feels the same. I just don't want to mess up his personal growth in his life. How do I even approach the subject of money without him feeling like I'm flexing on him? And like I know I can't really cater to a man's insecurities. But how do I even gauge if he's ready? How do I gauge why he's with me, and whether or not he's actually ready for marriage?

And when we get back together, like how does that even go? I mean all of it. I feel like it all feels so abstract to navigate or something. I am more chaotic/volatile/risky in my finances than he is and I feel like he'd maybe think that was immature. But ultimately it has payed off for me, although I admit other people I don't really believe it is a good choice for them in their finances. And I am a lot more settled in my decisions now than I used to be. He was raised with a lot more structure than I was in a lot of different ways and I was kinda a rags to riches type scenario. Do I merge finances? Do we marry? I'm fully aware everyone here will be like sign a prenup. But I'm prepared for him to fully take half my assets if it ends and to be subjected to the law for asset division. I do not care, and in my opinion anyone who's dedicated enough to marry me deserves it. 

How will living together work? The last time that happened it didn't go super well because I wasn't upfront with the fact (as in I never disclosed it at all) I was raised in a severe hoard, and his dad I'm not saying didn't fill their garage, but it was nothing compared to what I was raised in. So I objectively thought he was just lying to me when he described his family as hoarders. So I constantly kinda felt like not super comfortable opening up on that, but I've come to terms with how that actually effected me. And I don't hoard, but I didn't ever learn like basic cleaning skills and I know he thought I was just some lazy slob when we lived together. But I'm honestly just so much better now, but it was something I kinda felt guilty not addressing at the time but like I was young and not mentally capable of acknowledging it at all. And it was something I was socially conditioned to lie about. And like I have actually come to enjoy cleaning, but I'm still not super great with the routine aspect of it. And I could totally hire someone to do it, but I kinda wanted to have that skill for myself because I know it's a deeper issue floating around my subconscious I really want to confront and grow from. So like not only do I feel bad about basically lying to him about it. It's like I feel like I should disclose that before I agree to marry him/even reunite at all. It's like instinctually I kinda want to tell him about the childhood I had. And I'm actually nervous to have that conversation. And it's not something I just casually want to bring up you know? Like oh hey, btw I was really messed up from my childhood. It feels like something that requires like a long drawn out backstory. And it's not like I can even bring him back home to show him, because my family are no longer hoarders (praise the lord) (since I moved back I basically cleaned up my entire family's lives and we've been better ever since so I feel some type of way about moving back in with my ex as a result because I also am afraid my family will return to just objective discontent. And like I know I could just hire someone to clean for them and stuff, but it kinda feels like I'm abandoning them or something progressing forward with my life, even though I know they're happy for me and want me to do great things with my life, also I feel like there's some aspect where my parent's self worth is tied to me needing them), so there's just this hint of it haunting around my life that I feel like my partner objectively has a right to know about before they marry me and I don't really know how to approach that subject.


 As far as the money, I know he'd be thrilled and like I thought about just telling him the night of our wedding. But I also kinda don't want to objectively mess with his perception of self, or start a marriage under false pretenses (even if it is a good thing), and I want to gauge whether or not he knows already. Like I'm not super flaunty, but he and his family have known me awhile enough to think something is up, just baseline I've had some level of upgrades in reguards to aesthetics, but the average person wouldn't be clued in on it, and I kinda doubt they fully realize the scale. So like do I keep that a happy surprise? I  expect him to formally propose, so I mean I guess I could wait until then to tell him about the hoarding, but idk that kinda feels cruel to do too and seems like it would ruin a special day. And I know there's no rush, but it's like I'm ready to be with him finally again. 

And I know this has the ability to shake up the way our lives are structured. Because objectively I go throughout my weeks basically doing little projects and then maybe doing a specific bigger task and then a 3 day break, and repeat. And I know he's more structured and like I kinda appreciate the routine aspect of life, but I want it to feel like more engaging or something if that makes sense rather than sisyphean. Like I want structure but I want it to feel like a ritual and I don't quite know like logistically how to integrate that into the life changes I'm facing.",1,1747081238.0,relationship_advice,20,1.0,False

1kl2r7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tech_Philippines/comments/1kl2r7o/after_a_month_of_only_using_gcash_tap_n_pay/,After a month of only using GCash Tap N Pay,"I decided to take on a challenge where I’d exclusively use **GCash Tap n Pay** for all my purchases in a month, avoiding cash and other forms of payment, with only a small amount of emergency cash (₱250). Here’s what I learned about the feasibility and practicality of using **Gcash Tap n Pay** in the Philippines. (note that I live around Metro Manila, Quezon City)

# Main Experience

Using **Tap n Pay** was overall a **fun and convenient** experience. It felt **safe** because of the tokenized transactions that come with NFC payments. Compared to **QR payments**, Tap n Pay was more reliable—QR scanning often felt outdated, and I encountered issues with scannability due to reflections or worn-down printouts at some establishments.

There were times when I was told that the store’s system doesn’t accept this form of payment yet. While this could be true, I also suspect that many cashiers aren't fully trained or informed about how this payment method works, especially since it’s still relatively new in the market.

However, Tap n Pay worked well at many major stores like **Savemore**, **SM Stores**, **Watsons**, fast food chains, and coffee shops. The key to success was ensuring the store had a compatible terminal—look for terminals from **Maya**, **BDO**, **Paymate**, or any POS terminal that supports contactless payments. It's always best to ask first if you're unsure.

There were a few hiccups, though, with the feature being unavailable or not detected by the app. But I found a quick fix, which I’ll share later.

# Establishments Where Tap n Pay Worked

Here’s a list of places where I successfully used Tap n Pay (though not all locations are guaranteed to accept it):

* **Savemore Market**
* **SM Supermarket**
* **Lawsons**
* **mang-inasal**
* **Jollibee**
* **McDonald's**
* **Chowking**
* **Starbucks**
* **Zus Coffee**
* **Mr. DIY**
* **Mercury Drug** \*
* **Ever Supermarket \***
* **Timezone**

Establishments with an asterisk asked me for a physical card because their system requires your full card number, name, and expiration which defeats the purpose of Tap n Pay's secure tokenized payments.  


The most surprising was **7-Eleven**, as I thought they’d be more updated, but many branches still didn’t accept Tap n Pay.

# Pros and Cons of Tap n Pay

# Pros:

* **Convenient and Safer**: The process is faster and more secure than QR scanning, and you don't need to worry about carrying cash or physical cards.
* **Lightens Your Wallet**: Using Tap n Pay means you don’t need to carry physical cards, reducing the risk if your wallet gets lost or stolen.
* **Ease of Use**: With NFC payments, you just tap your phone—no need to fiddle with QR codes or deal with issues like angles or damage.

# Cons:

* **Limited Acceptance**: Not all businesses have the terminals that support Tap n Pay. Some stores still rely on QR payments or cash.
* **App and Internet Dependence**: The app must be open, and you need an internet connection for it to work, unlike Google Pay, which can function offline (though with some limitations based on your bank’s policy).
* **Occasional Reconfiguration**: Sometimes, the app needs to be reconfigured or reset to make it work again.
* **Public Transport Issues**: Currently, Tap n Pay isn’t available for use on most public transport, meaning I had to rely on cash or my beep card for those trips. (works on BGC Busses but is 1 second slower than using your beep card)
* **Educating Cashiers**: Some merchants might not be familiar with the payment system, requiring you to assure them or even walk them through the process.
* **Minimum Spend Requirement**: Some stores set a minimum spend (ranging from ₱100-₱500) when using cards.
* **Transaction Failures**: There are times when I have to tap my phone again because the transaction failed or didn’t go through the first time. This can be frustrating, especially when you're in a rush, and you may need to retry the payment multiple times before it succeeds.
* **Credit vs Debit Confusion**: When using **Tap n Pay**, the system often recognizes it as a **credit card** rather than a **debit card**, which can create confusion with merchants or the point-of-sale (POS) system. This may lead to misunderstandings or issues, especially if the store's terminal is set up to handle debit and credit differently. (i would personally want this changed to **debit card** when using your wallet's balance and **credit card** when you're using GGives or GCredit)

# Quick Fix for Tap n Pay Not Working Issues

If Tap n Pay stops working or isn’t detected, I found that clearing your app’s data and reconfiguring it usually does the trick. If that doesn’t work, your phone’s **NFC chip** might be damaged or not supported, or there could be a system outage with GCash. You can also check if the feature is down for maintenance or consult GCash’s help articles for troubleshooting. you can also look at this list of phones that have and don't have NFC [here](https://www.nfcw.com/nfc-phones-list/).


# Compatibility

GCash Tap n Pay is only compatible with **some Android devices** that have an NFC chip. My phone, the **Sony Xperia 1 II**, works fine, but my friend's **POCO X4 Pro** couldn’t enable Tap n Pay. Unfortunately, **Apple** and **Huawei** devices aren’t supported, and you can’t use wearables like watches to make payments with GCash Tap n Pay just yet.

# 

# Final Thoughts

Despite a few hurdles, **Tap n Pay** offers a convenient, secure, and tech-forward way to pay for workers and students like me where convenience and time is valuable. It’s already working well at many major establishments, but there’s still room for improvement, especially with merchant education and more widespread terminal adoption. It may not be as convenient like google pay, apple pay, and samsung pay but it’s definitely worth exploring and using, but make sure to keep some cash on hand for places that aren’t quite there yet.


note about bdo terminals:

i've tried using bdo's new handheld terminals (i think its the one partnered with ingenico) and the ingenico terminals. whenever i try to pay with tap to pay on those terminals it always appears as transaction failed on both the terminal and my phone. it also reverts and disables tap to pay hence me needing to do the quick fix.

We all get lonely, we all need a hug sometimes, we all need the warmth of someone. Due to the presure we all are going though the declining mental health! So why are we soo shy to ask for it? Ask for a hug? Ask for a cuddle? 

We all can agree that cuddling is really comforting but I don't see a cuddling buddy culture here unless you got a partner or a FWB and I know it would be great that way. But we can also just hug and cuddle a random stranger who is far from the troubles of your life.

But anyways back to the point. I m seeking for a cuddle Buddy, maybe we can hangout sometimes or on weekends! Be pals. But can also feel free to hug each other.

When I mention cuddling I don't don't mean anything s*xual or explicit just inocent hugging, and cuddling. The idea is foreign but can be tried out with matured people.

About me: I m a male, straight.
Seeking for opposite gender (females) cause it would be super weird cuddling a guy lol.

This happened on Saturday afternoon, I (27,F) had just gotten out of the shower while listening to music when all of a sudden the music started having a weird eco and I couldn’t understand the words. Heart started raising really badly with light dizziness that i had to hold onto the sink. Afterwards my fingers then hands started to shake and I couldn’t hold onto anything. I was looking at my hands while they shook and fell to the ground and started shaking/convulsing. My head hit the wall behind me and was hitting it lightly during the convulsions, and I was aware of what was happening and honestly thought that it was time to meet God. 
It stopped after maybe 30-40 seconds and I stood up and looked in the mirror. 
My face was so pale almost yellowish, and my lips were blue. 
This is the first time I experience such thing and it has scared me to my core that I need an explanation. 
For some health background: 
1. I take Valacyclovir (1g) as needed, Buspirone (5 mg) every morning, Uro probiotic 2 capsules a day in the morning. 
2. I have been on a diet since October 2024, where I lost almost 40lbs. Diet is not extreme, consists of cheese sandwich for breakfast with coffee, a payday and Celsius for lunch and a decent dinner around 7 or 8pm. 
3. I am not completely stressed out, my relationship is going good, I had just passed a certification exam the morning of the incident. 
4. I sleep 7-8 hours a day except the days leading up to the incident where I slept 6 hours. 
5. I have been using vapes for the past 2 years. Not constantly but I do use it daily. 
6. I had a vitamins panel blood test done 2 weeks ago and everything came back normal. 
7. Ringing in the left ear since I started Buspirone, which is a side effect of the medication. 
8.  My upper back and left side of head hurts constantly and I need to crack my neck otherwise it gets stiff.
9. I have been getting bruised easily lately, although I am not low on Iron. 
Since the incident, I am scared it will happen again, especially while I am driving or going up and down stairs. 
I keep getting mini-panic attacks now. 
I don’t have very good insurance and every neurology office I have called doesn’t take my insurance. Hoping I can get some direction on what this is. How concerned should I be, and what to do next.

1kl2og2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kl2og2/discover_the_jura_ena_4_espresso_machine_review/,Discover the Jura ENA 4 Espresso Machine Review Is It Worth Buying?,"The Jura 15374 ENA 4 Full Metropolitan Black espresso machine has been part of my daily coffee routine for a few weeks now, and it’s the kind of tool that makes mornings—well—tolerable. With its carefully honed engineering, the machine is built with JURA’s Pulse Extraction Process (PEP) that claims to optimize flavor like a barista. I was curious to see if it lived up to its promise or merely dressed the part. Here’s my daily grind with this piece of caffeinated technology.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, this espresso machine felt like a piece of modern art with function stitched into its veins. It sports a sleek black finish that blends effortlessly into most kitchen decors. The compact dimensions (17.5""D x 10.7""W x 12.7""H) mean it doesn’t monopolize countertop real estate, which is always a win. At 21 pounds, it has a solid, weighty feel—none of that flimsy plastic nonsense. The integrated coffee grinder and buttons on its human-interface panel keep the design user-friendly without feeling overly “techy.”

**Ease of Use**  
It’s fully automatic and simplifies the process of making four types of coffee specialties: Espresso, Coffee, Espresso Doppio, and Coffee Doppio. Gone are the days of manually tweaking settings and second-guessing grind sizes. I appreciated the buttons, straightforward and devoid of unnecessary digital touchscreens, catering to those who prefer simplicity over complexity. Yet, I wish it sported just a bit more customization; there were moments when I felt like I was riding its programming wave instead of steering my preferences.  

**Perks**  
- *Pulse Extraction Process (PEP)* optimizes flavor exceptionally well.  
- Compact and modern design fits small kitchens effortlessly.  
- Offers multiple specialty coffee options with just one touch.  

[Check Jura 15374 ENA 4 price on Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08yfd1jg3/)

**Performance in Action**  
In daily testing, the standout feature undeniably became its Aroma G3 Grinder. That thing roars with twice the speed of some of its peers, and the aroma preservation legitimately impressed me every morning. The PEP system appeared to deliver on its promise, especially with espresso shots that gave a rich, velvety crema layer. However, running the machine for consecutive drinks highlighted a potential downside—its water tank capacity. At 37 ounces, refilling felt a bit too frequent for someone prone to caffeine binges. The 4.4-ounce bean container, though, worked well to preserve freshness as beans were ground to order.

**Pluses**  
- The Aroma G3 Grinder amplifies efficiency without sacrificing taste.  
- PEP delivers top-notch espresso quality, comparable to premium cafes.  
- No capsules reduce waste, striking an eco-conscious chord.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited tank capacity at 37 ounces; not ideal for heavy or group use.  
- Could struggle to fully satisfy users seeking advanced programming options.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this espresso machine to popular competitors like the Breville Bambino Plus or the DeLonghi Magnifica, the Jura 15374 ENA 4 holds a unique advantage in automated simplicity. While the Breville offers more manual control for coffee crafting enthusiasts, it lags behind in its grinder speed. On the flip side, DeLonghi Magnifica brings a larger water capacity, making it better suited for office environments. However, Jura scores a unique win with its exclusive PEP. The aroma retention here might just tip the scales for diehard coffee aficionados who prioritize freshness above all else.

**True Value**  
When it comes to cost-effectiveness, this coffee machine hits an intriguing balance. Premium enough to demand a higher price tag, but the reliability of JURA’s engineering and sustained flavor delivery over time make it feel like a solid investment. Unlike capsule machines, it reduces waste and ongoing expenses as there’s no need for pods or capsules. Sure, it may lack advanced customization or higher tank capacity, but it beautifully fulfills what it promises: café-like coffee at the touch of a button from the comfort of home.

1kl2ofu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kl2ofu/does_elite_gourmet_ec812_coffee_percolator/,Does Elite Gourmet EC812 Coffee Percolator Deliver Fresh Brews? Detailed Review,"Testing the **Elite Gourmet EC812 Electric Coffee Percolator** in my daily routine has been a delightful experience. This old-fashioned brewing marvel combines a nostalgic aesthetic with modern convenience, tailored perfectly for someone who treasures a piping hot pot of coffee or tea. The percolator itself boasts a stainless-steel design with a polished shine that you'd proudly display on your kitchen counter. Its lightweight build makes transportation simple, but the overall construction still feels durable, reassuring me that it's built to last.

**Usability and Brewing Performance**

I couldn't wait to dive into its brewing capabilities, and this machine didn't disappoint. Brewing up to 12 cups of coffee in under a minute per cup, it accommodates busy mornings and afternoon gatherings alike. The reusable stainless steel filter is a lifesaver—washing it was surprisingly hassle-free. Once the coffee is brewed, the automatic ""Keep Warm"" feature kicks in, maintaining that just-brewed temperature without scorching the coffee. This is where the percolator shines; the coffee remains flavorful and aromatic for hours.

**Key Benefits:**

- Brews coffee or tea incredibly fast—perfect when mornings are chaotic.
- Transparent brew progress knob offers a nostalgic and functional touch.
- Reusable filter eliminates the need for disposable paper filters, saving money and reducing waste.

[Check Elite Gourmet EC812 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b09mmn1ccp/)

**Design and Comfort**

What caught my eye initially was its ergonomic design. The cool-touch handle is a thoughtful addition, ensuring safety no matter how hot the contents inside get. The snap-on lid, paired with the precision-pouring spout, ensures you won’t accidentally splash coffee everywhere while serving. Its swivel base makes it so easy to lift the percolator and serve cordlessly, whether hosting or just moving around freely. Something as simple as the wrap-around cord storage might seem minor, but it truly keeps your countertop clutter-free.

**Favorable Attributes:**

- Cordless 360-degree swivel base improves portability.
- Cool-touch handle and precision pouring spout are practical and safe.
- Compact design despite accommodating 12 cups.

**Performance Limitations**

While impressive, there are a few areas I'd note for improvement. The percolator can sometimes struggle with smaller batches of coffee, often leading to flavors that are less robust compared to its maximum capacity brew. Another minor annoyance is the brew light responsible for letting you know coffee is ready—it isn’t always bright enough to notice in daylight. Lastly, cleanup is easy for the most part, but you’ll need to be meticulous when washing the precision-pouring spout, which occasionally retains coffee residues.

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Small batch brewing can compromise flavor quality.
- Brew-ready indication light isn't always visible.
- Pouring spout needs extra attention when cleaning.

**Other Options**

When comparing this percolator to peer products, a few considerations come to mind. Standard drip coffee makers like the Mr. Coffee 12-cup brewer sacrifice flavor extraction for convenience. On the other hand, pricier French press models, while excellent for small batches, require hands-on brewing. This percolator bridges an interesting gap—offering the robust flavor extraction akin to French presses yet delivering the quantity and speed of traditional electric makers like Hamilton Beach models. However, models from Cuisinart, such as their Classic Percolator, offer slightly higher capacity and sleeker designs at a higher price point. If you're someone who prioritizes affordability without sacrificing durability or flavor, this device holds its own remarkably well.

**Price Worthiness**

When contemplating whether this machine is worth the investment, it boils down to your brewing style. It’s a fantastic value for households or individuals that love a fresh, strong cup of coffee or tea without involving pods or extravagant setups. Its automated ""Keep Warm"" feature and portability factor truly make it a solid contender against other coffee appliances at its price range. The features strategically balance cost and efficiency, making it a reliable, daily-use coffee companion.
