I just discovered this subreddit tonight and I thought I'd give this a shot. I experienced that thing I think most people do in their mid 30s where everyone moves in opposite directions and before you know it there's either no one left nearby or no one left that shares your interests.

  
I'm looking for anyone that's either near my age or willing to hang out with an old lady like myself to do nerdy things around the city. Like:  


\- **Karaoke!!!** Anyone that enjoys JPOP including 2000s idols or Anime music or Broadway. I am happy to go either way. There's a new Broadway themed choir that started in the city that I'd love to visit.

\- Themed Cafes - Literally anything themed I'll try out once. I also love a fancy high tea moment and would be happy to try out new places.

\- Anime/Gaming Events - I go to Toronto Comic Con, Anime North and Fan Expo every year and would love to go to more. Soundtrack concerts are also a favourite of mine, I'd also love to see more movies or event screenings.

\- Books - Do you like manga or romance novels and just want a coffee and browse buddy? I can do that! I collect Shojo, Josei and BL titles as well as have a huge stack of contemporary and fantasy romance novels in my library at home.

\- Japanese - Are you studying Japanese and want a study buddy? I studied for years and have my JLPT N1 but would like to retake the exam to challenge myself to relearn a lot of things I've forgotten. Regardless of level if you want study advice or a judgement-free place to practice I'd be happy to help.

**Current Interests**

* Love and Deepspace (**current hyperfixation**)
   *  My dream come true would be to find another LADS player to visit the themed events around the city with. Zayne's birthday is coming up and then Xavier's is soon after. This game has brought me so much comfort and joy over the last year and I just want to gush about it with someone.
* Hoyo Games
   *  I'm super late to this but I picked up ZZZ, loved it and am now branching out to Honkai and Genshin.
* Manga/Anime/Novels
   * The Summer Hikaru Died
   * The Other World's Books Depend On The Bean Counter
   * Kakuriyo
   * Heaven Official's Blessing (FINALLY!)
   * Apothecary Diaries

**Notes**

\- I am not super chatty in DMs. I am an introvert that's trying her best to not be a gremlin. If you can be a bit patient with me I'll try my best.

\- I am a pretty nervous person. I will not flake when I make plans but I might be high strung. I promise I act normal once I get to know people. 

\- I feel very icky saying this but considering this is the internet : ***I am happily married and this is not a secret dating profile.***",1,1755572413.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,0,1.0,False

I began fasting as a way to help me reduce some medical concerns; prediabetes and high blood pressure. 

Before IF I made massive diet changes, cut carbs significantly but continued on grazing thriugjuht the day. Sadly I didn't see my numbers change. So I did some reading saw some of y'alls journeys here, and I got motivated to start. 

After only 5 months of 18:6 I was no longer pre-diabetic and out of hypertension 1. But my energy levels were P O O R, especially during my eating window. I did a lot of reading about OMAD and saw it can help, so I bit the bullet and worked up to it over a couple months. 

Now officially at the end of one month of OMAD, I feel like I have insane energy levels during my fasting window. I get pretty sleepy right after eating (siesta time), but I feel amazing during fasting. It's really helped me at the gym and to shed a couple of those extra stubborn pounds. 

I wanted to share in case anyone else had thought about it.

I try to aim myself in a window of about 90-140 g protien, 60-75g fats, and 90-140 g carbs. I always have a fiber supplement + protien shake as my last source of food, I've found I stay satiated well into the next day that way, regardless of what I ate beforehand. 

When I get peckish before my eating window I make myself a cup of coffee and chase iy with a big water+electrictrolytes and walk or hit the gym. 

The full weight journey has been from 258 lbs (~32% body fat) to 204 (~20% body fat) in a little under 8 months now. With a significant amount of fat loss during my OMAD start up. (I am in a deficit; not in body recomp). This has been assisted with 1 hours resistance training 5 days a week and 10k steps daily. 

After being a life long weight lifter and suddenly seeing the fat come off I thought I'd be stuck with forever, I'm happy to have jumped into OMAD. Especially after believing all day grazing was the way to go. Now im here to keep my A1C and BP in the green.

*August 19, 2025 ‚Äî A Game Where the Runs Might Flow Like a K-Cup Coffee Spill*

The KBO‚Äôs latest grudge match pits the **Samsung Lions** against the **NC Dinos** in a clash that‚Äôs as evenly matched as a tug-of-war between two overcooked hot dogs. Let‚Äôs parse the odds, digest the (fabricated but plausible) news, and crown a winner with the grace of a toddler wearing a tiara.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Statistical Tango

The betting lines scream ‚Äú*yawn*‚Äù at first glance. Every bookmaker on the planet has this as a near-tossup. At Bovada, both teams sit at **1.87** on the moneyline, implying a **53.47% chance** for either squad to win. The spreads? NC Dinos are favored by **-1.5 runs** (with odds of +285), while Samsung sits at **+1.5 runs (-140)**. The totals? A pedestrian **8.5 runs**, with ‚ÄúOver‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnder‚Äù odds hovering around **1.85-1.95**.

Translation: This game is a statistical stalemate. The only thing more balanced than these odds is a Korean barbecue plate loaded with kimchi, bulgogi, and enough side dishes to feed a small army.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Shenanigans, and One Tripped-Up Ace

Let‚Äôs spice things up with some *fictional* team updates:

* **Samsung Lions**: Their star right-hander, **Jung Hoon ‚ÄúThe Human Torpedo‚Äù Park**, is sidelined after ‚Äúsuffering a mysterious injury during a team-building exercise involving trust falls and a malfunctioning karaoke machine.‚Äù Sources say he tripped over his own shoelaces mid-performance of ‚ÄúGangnam Style,‚Äù leading to a strained ego (and possibly a hamstring). Backup pitcher **Lee Doobie** will start, though his nickname‚Äî‚ÄúThe Wild Coffee Shot‚Äù‚Äîshould raise eyebrows.
* **NC Dinos**: They‚Äôve leaned into their bullpen, which is ‚Äúso deep, they could host a submarine base.‚Äù Closer **Kang ‚ÄúThe Wall‚Äù Min-Jae** has a 98-mph fastball and the demeanor of a man who‚Äôs seen too many Samsung fanatics jeer his family. Oh, and th

I would strongly encourage everyone impacted by return to office (read: return to Downtown Toronto) to do the same. Let‚Äôs let the people in power know that the Toronto economy is not the provincial economy!

‚ÄúDear Mayor Scarpitti,

I am writing to you not only as a resident of Markham but also as a committed employee of the Ontario Public Service (OPS), to express my concern about Premier Doug Ford‚Äôs recent mandate requiring OPS employees to return to the office in Toronto full time.

This decision poses significant challenges for many of us living in Markham. Beyond the increased cost, stress, and time associated with the commute, this change will have a direct economic impact on our city. As someone who has been working in a hybrid capacity, I have consistently supported local businesses, whether it‚Äôs grabbing coffee at a local caf√©, shopping in town, or spending on services throughout the workweek. I have had more time with my family to spend time in Markham.

However, returning to the office in Toronto full time means that much of my weekday discretionary spending meals, transit costs, daily purchases will be redirected away from Markham and into Toronto. This shift takes dollars out of our local economy and away from the small businesses that rely on the daily presence and spending of residents who work remotely or hybrid.

Additionally, the hybrid model has proven effective in maintaining productivity, morale, and work-life balance. Moving away from that model not only affects our quality of life but also risks undermining the vibrancy and growth Markham has built by attracting professionals who now face a difficult choice: endure this new burden or relocate closer to Toronto.

I respectfully urge you to advocate on behalf of residents/ taxpayers and raise this issue with the provincial government. A more balanced, flexible work policy would better support both the effectiveness of the OPS and the economic health of communities like ours.

Thank you for your time and for your ongoing commitment to the people of Markham. 

Sincerely, X",9,1755571782.0,Markham,1,1.0,False
1mu6n66,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mu6n66,Have you tried Sumatran Sidra?,"Most people in the West think of Sumatran coffee as earthy, woody, and herbal. That‚Äôs the classic wet-hulled profile.
But these days in Indonesia, Singapore, and Japan, Sumatran coffees are often seen as fruity berry bombs, especially from the Aceh Gayo region. If you haven‚Äôt tried modern Sumatran specialty coffee, you should.

This one‚Äôs a Sidra from Tapanuli, North Sumatra, grown by Alex Hutabarat, who started planting Sidra from Ecuador in 2021.
It‚Äôs a natural lot, green coffee priced at IDR 650k (~US $40) per kg, roasted by Two Hands Full Roastery in West Java.

The cup has clear red berry notes (strawberry, raspberry, cherry), layered with soft tropicals like papaya. Sweetness is delicate but intense, almost nectar-like. The body is silky, leaning tea-like, with just a subtle hint of spice on the finish. The aftertaste is super clean.

Overall, it‚Äôs a beautiful coffee for anyone who loves sweet fruit bombs without the funk or booziness. I‚Äôm really impressed and excited to see where North Sumatran coffees go next.",3,1755571725.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve told several friends/family and it mostly positive feedback but they also know me. I know most would be real with me though..but it‚Äôs different coming from people who don‚Äôt know me. Also, thank you very very much for any feedback I can get here. I feel like a 16 year old again üòÖ just a lot more matured now‚Ä¶I‚Äôm 26M, I want to say she‚Äôs 21 maybe 22‚Ä¶

So I go to a drive thru coffee shop fairly often, this woman takes my order, my first instinct was not to ask for her number, she was nice but I thought she was just being nice because she‚Äôs taking my order. But then she goes out of her way the next time to talk to me, then she squeezed in between 2 co workers at the window to talk to me again, so I asked for her name and went on my way‚Ä¶

Then I go in again, this time though, to see if she‚Äôs interested‚Ä¶I go 5 times in a row and the opportunity wasn‚Äôt there.

Now, it‚Äôs Friday, I had her name, I search her on insta, in my head, I was trying to shoot my shot all week and it just wasn‚Äôt working out. So I sent a follow request.

THEN, the very next day‚Ä¶guess who brings me out my drink!? So I ask her what I‚Äôve been trying to ask all week and she says yes! Then she asks if that was me who requested the day before‚Ä¶I of course said yes and I started talking too much, there was a line behind me, she had to go, then I realize I never even asked for her number‚Ä¶can‚Äôt lie, patience probably would have helped me there.

So I‚Äôm like, well she knows I requested to follow her. She‚Äôll just accept it and I‚Äôll DM her. Well she didn‚Äôt. So I just messaged anyways later that day. That was Saturday‚Ä¶then Sunday comes around and I‚Äôm telling my buddy about it and he says she would have accepted it by now if she was going to‚Ä¶so I canceled the request‚Ä¶

I drive through today with my cousin, I see the girl I‚Äôve been interested in as we pull in from the other side, we get our order taken, pull up to the window, I‚Äôm looking through the window towards the back to see if I can see her, I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶but I look back in front of me, see 3 of the girls looking directly at me, smiling and whispering to each other..I just half smiled back knowing full well they were talking about me‚Ä¶hopefully it was good üòÖ

Overall, I think overthinking this. I‚Äôm infatuated is probably the best description.

To add, it‚Äôs not beauty that got me interested which is normally how it would go. It wasn‚Äôt until after the 3rd short conversation that I started paying real attention to her. I‚Äôve seen her plenty of times before and never thought anything of it. Now I look at her and she‚Äôs just more beautiful with each time I see her. Maybe 10 years ago in high school I felt excited like this. My experience has always been very indifferent if they said yes or no. Even during the dates with others I thought were super attractive, I just enjoyed the date with them and was fine whatever direction it went. Not butterflies in my stomach like this‚Ä¶

is this normally how it goes? Am I just  overthinking this? I almost wasn‚Äôt going to go in the rest of the week after the girls doing that. At first I thought it might be a good sign since that‚Äôs the only thing I can think of as to why they‚Äôd do that and would mean she told them‚Ä¶ But also maybe it‚Äôs bad?",1,1755571521.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Last year around October this thing  terrorized me and my family for a few nights. It started with it just bothering me so I thought I was just seeing things, until two of my sisters saw it in the driveway one night while they were taking out the trash. They both ran back inside and we locked the house and for the rest of the night we were scared and heard it outside just walking around, even saw it a few times. We called the cops because we hoped it was some  jerks playing a prank on us, but the cops got here and saw no footprints just animal tracks all around the house. They left, and when we all went to bed I was the only one that slept in my room (my sisters piled up in the living room) and for the rest of the night I heard it tapping against my window and trying to get me to go outside. I didn‚Äôt fall asleep until the sun went up because I was so scared. After that, my mom and sister saged the whole property and some other things I can‚Äôt remember.

Tonight, I went for a walk. The sun was almost down, and I really wanted a coffee so I decided to walk to our local dollar store. It was a thirty-forty minute walk so I knew I could make it before they closed because I‚Äôve done it before. As soon as I‚Äôm out of the driveway and walking up a hill to the main road, I hear something growling and I think it‚Äôs a dog so I keep walking. I start feeling like something‚Äôs following me so I tell myself to just make it the park and I‚Äôll turn back around and lose it on one of the side roads. I‚Äôm texting my friends while this is happening and one of my friend and his mom drives by and asks if I need a ride back home.

""An Agent Of Protection"" by T. A. Ortiz

An Agent of Protection

Chapter One: False Dawn

It was a cool, crisp morning, as the sun had barely begun to spread its dawning light. ""Hey! Morning, sunshine. You look like a bed of roses. Look, Vincent, I don't know why you have Mr. Richard calling my damn phone, but he said he's gonna need you to bring that dumper back to the yard, pronto!""

The coffee hadn't kicked in yet, and the weariness of my night persisted into the dawning. I slowly turned my head to look with a blank stare, as if to say, dude, I'm not fucking up yet. I calmly said, ""Jody, it's too early, my man, and why the fuck didn't he go to Miguel with this shit yesterday? I already told Richard he doesn't pay me enough for all I got to do around here. My coffee hasn't even cranked its shafts, for crying out loud!""

Jody laughed after my outburst. ""Well, don't shoot the messenger, my friend. How about that, huh? I'm already stressed with how much white gold we're gonna be pouring today. You said twenty, I said potentially twenty-five yards or so. With this much work, we better be getting that bonus! I could use a vacation. I don't want to spend the rest of my life working harder than the heat in the Sahara.""

I laughed at our usual shenanigans and Jody's uplifting sense of humor, though he knew exactly where I was coming from this early in the morning. ""Where are the goddamn keys for that piece of shit? Can you grab them from inside the office? Shit, they're not, are they?"" I gave the last of my morning energy to the final outburst.

Jody looked at me with a smirk and said, ""I'm so sorry to bother you, my love, but I think Richard has all the keys to our equipment, if I'm not mistaken. So, unfortunately, you're gonna have to go take your ass to get the keys from our dear, beloved boss, and I'll be here to support you, sweetie, from a distance!"" He laughed as if he was at a stand-up comedy show. His laugh was infectious in light of his antics toward my obvious frustrations.

I could do nothing but glare at him and his antics this early; it was the norm for him to try and get under my skin. Laughing, Jody chuckled and continued winding a cable that was used for heavy lifting and pulling. I said, ""You know, Jody, sometimes, I just want to do the opposite to your mouth what you're doing to that cable and just unwind your winding tongue."" He smiled and gave me a few slow, catlike blinks, further demonstrating his ability to tickle me with his annoyance.
Suddenly, my phone began to buzz.

""Mention the devil and they call. Thanks, Jody,"" I said, while he pretended not to hear a word of what I had said. Mischievously, Jody abruptly stopped for a second and turned to face me. He said, ""It makes sense now why he refers to you as 'Vince Allstate'‚Äîbecause he knows he can call you and he'd always be in good hands."" Jody then smirked at me as if to say, how's that feel, again?

""Richard, good morning, sir. Yeah, boss, I'm aware. Look, I just pulled up at the office, and we've got about 20 trucks or so coming in. Well, yeah, only Jody and a few of the other guys are here with me now. The rest haven't shown up yet. Yeah, we should start around 8:30. I guess they've got a little bit more time before we head out, though. So you don't want Miguel or Tony taking the dumper? It's not like you can tell me, boss. Yeah, yeah. Alright, I know... okay, boss, I got it. I'll see you there when I'm done.""

On the other end of the line, Tristifus Richard, or just Richard as the rest of the crew called him, was just about ready to grab me through the phone and tear me a new asshole. Though my composure was calm and collected in front of Jody, he didn't know Tristifus like I did. As a matter of fact, he had no idea what we did in its entirety. He believed the construction we did here and there was it. Mind you, it was very substantial, the amount of contracted construction gigs we got. A credible means to an end. Oh well, he was an honest dude at the end of the day, and I respected the hell out of him for that.

Chapter Two: The Mask of Labor

Dropping the cable on top of a pallet, Jody dusted off his clothes, looked at me, and asked, ""What did he say?"" I told him that his boss was pretty insistent on me carrying the dump to the north yard.

""Why would he want you to carry it all the way to the north yard, though?"" Jody continued. ""The south yard is what, fifteen minutes from here? And Miguel's lazy ass would probably be the best bet to do some lame ass shit like that, right? I don't even understand why we gotta go all the way up there just to get fuel, too. I hate that bumpy ass road back there. It would make more sense to carry it there, that's all I'm saying."" 

Jody was talking a little too much and asking too many questions. It felt like a game of Marco Polo.

""Look, he's the boss. I don't question him too much as long as he's willing to make sure he writes my checks out for the right amount."" Jody laughed and said he definitely agreed with that, finally withdrawing from his interrogative thoughts.

We were scheduled to pour a massive entranceway that day. Before I could, however, I first had to go and take care of a particular task that I fronted as if someone else could have undertaken. Unbeknownst to Jody, I had spare keys for everything that had a lock that belonged to us. Sheds, lockers, equipment, you name it‚Äîand even the doors that can't be seen unless you knew where to look.

""Jody, make sure all the tools are on the truck. Make sure you have everything ready to sign off when we get through at the end of the day. When the rest of the guys get here, take them and head on out to the site. The concrete should start showing up roughly around eight.

Double-check and make sure everything's in place. I don't want any fuck-ups with this one. I'm gonna go take the dumper to the yard as our boss requested of me. You know I got a lot of faith in you, Jody.""

I began walking off towards the parked truck. Observant Jody noted as I tried to creep off without giving any more rise to his inquisitive nature. Caught like an escaped prisoner in the glare of the guard tower's spotlight, Jody said, ""But wait, boss, I thought you had to get the keys from Richard, though. You plan on hot-wiring the thing?"" He chuckled as usual, hiding the fact that he was genuinely asking.

I could only smile as I mentally noted why I needed to keep Jody at a fair distance. ""I was actually thinking about that!"" I laughed. ""No, I just remembered that Richard gave me a spare for the truck the last time he worked on it. Thank goodness, though, it saves my ass from definitively ruining the rest of my morning,"" I said, chuckling it off to further appease his humorous side. 

As I signed off with him and turned my back once again, heading towards the truck, I could feel his inquisitive stare trying to deduce me as if I was some walking, unknown puzzle to him.

1mu6ghr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1mu6ghr/technique_series_visualization_the_definitive/,Technique Series: Visualization - The Definitive Guide,"Welcome to the first part of a new series focused on the ""how."" We've talked about the philosophy; now let's talk about the tools. We're starting with the most famous, most powerful, and most misunderstood of them all: Visualization.

Most people give up on visualization because they believe they're failing. They can't ""see"" anything, they get bored, or they try too hard. This guide will demolish those myths and turn visualization into your most reliable tool.

1. The Great Myths (What Visualization is NOT)

Before you learn how to do it right, you have to unlearn what's wrong.

Myth 1: ""It has to be as vivid as a 4K movie.""
FALSE. This is the mistake that stops 90% of people. Visualization is not about visual clarity. The goal is not to ""see,"" it is to ""experience."" A vague feeling, a blurry impression, or a simple ""knowing"" that you are in the scene is a thousand times more powerful than an HD image with no feeling.

Myth 2: ""I can't visualize, I'm not a visual person.""
FALSE. Visualization is not limited to sight. It's about the imaginal senses. Can you imagine the sound of a loved one's voice? The feeling of sand in your hands? The smell of coffee? If you can do that, you can visualize. The feeling is the secret, not the sight.

Myth 3: ""I have to do it for hours.""
FALSE. Quality over quantity. A short, 5-10 second scene, charged with feeling and looped until it feels real, is infinitely more effective than a one-hour movie in your mind that leaves you drained.

2. The Tutorial: How to Visualize Correctly (The Simple Method)

The process is simple. First, you create your scene, then you enter the right state to impress it.

Step 1: Define the End Scene.
Do not visualize the ""how."" Choose a short scene that implies your desire is already fulfilled.

For a Relationship: Don't visualize the first date. Visualize a friend congratulating you on your anniversary, or the feeling of your partner's head resting on your chest.

For Money: Don't visualize how you earn it. Visualize opening your banking app and seeing the desired balance, feeling the wave of relief and freedom.

For a Job: Don't visualize the interview. Visualize yourself sitting at your new desk, taking a sip of coffee, and feeling a sense of satisfaction.

Step 2: Go First-Person and Engage the Senses.
You must be inside the scene, looking through your own eyes. Ask yourself:

What do I physically feel? (The warmth of a hand, the phone in your palm, the texture of the desk).

What do I hear? (The words of congratulations, a specific sound in the room).

What do I emotionally feel? (Relief, gratitude, joy, peace, security).
This emotional feeling is the goal. It is the signature you are impressing upon your subconscious.

Step 3: Enter the State to Impress (Meditation & SATS).
You don't visualize with a busy, active mind. You must enter a relaxed, receptive state first.

Meditation: Before you begin, take 5-10 minutes to meditate. Simply sit or lie down, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. Relax your body from your toes to your head. This quiets the conscious mind and opens the door to the subconscious.

SATS (State Akin To Sleep): This is the most powerful time to visualize. As you are lying in bed about to fall asleep, your mind is naturally in a drowsy, trance-like state. This is the ""sweet spot"" where the subconscious is most receptive.

Step 4: Loop the Scene.
Once you are in that relaxed, meditative, or SATS state, bring up your short, first-person scene. Play it over and over, like a GIF in your mind. Don't force it. Gently loop it until it begins to feel natural and generates the desired emotional feeling. If you're doing this in SATS, continue looping until you fall asleep in the feeling of the wish fulfilled.

3. The Do's and Don'ts (The Quick Guide)

DO:

Keep your scene short and loop it.

Focus on the FEELING of the wish fulfilled.

Visualize from a 1st-person perspective.

Choose a scene that IMPLIES the end result is already a fact.

Relax and enjoy the process; it should feel like a pleasant daydream.

Drop it afterwards and trust that the seed has been planted.

DON'T:

Don't create a long, complicated movie.

Don't obsess over visual clarity or ""getting it perfect.""

Don't watch yourself from the outside (3rd-person).

Don't visualize the ""how"" or the process of getting your desire.

Don't turn it into a chore or a stressful effort.

Don't keep ""checking"" the 3D world for results after your session.

Conclusion:

Stop treating visualization like an art exam you have to pass. It is a playground. It is the act of briefly visiting your future so you can feel it in your present. The feeling is the secret. The feeling is the prayer that is always answered. Now go and build your house.",2,1755571200.0,NevilleGoddard,0,0.75,False

Because if you really believed your dream life was on its way, or already unfolding, or already here!! you would be obsessed with the present. You would be in love with life right now! You would be happy! kind! excited! full of love!!!!!

But no one wants to do this.
Because it‚Äôs simple!!! but not easy.
It means slowing down. Feeling. Being grateful. 

it doesn‚Äôt mean pretend your soulmate is next to you.

it doesn‚Äôt mean act like you‚Äôre rich when you‚Äôre broke.

it means:

look at your life, the bed you sleep in, the sky, the coffee, the quiet.

Last year around October this thing  terrorized me and my family for a few nights. It started with it just bothering me so I thought I was just seeing things, until two of my sisters saw it in the driveway one night while they were taking out the trash. They both ran back inside and we locked the house and for the rest of the night we were scared and heard it outside just walking around, even saw it a few times. We called the cops because we hoped it was some  jerks playing a prank on us, but the cops got here and saw no footprints just animal tracks all around the house. They left, and when we all went to bed I was the only one that slept in my room (my sisters piled up in the living room) and for the rest of the night I heard it tapping against my window and trying to get me to go outside. I didn‚Äôt fall asleep until the sun went up because I was so scared. After that, my mom and sister saged the whole property and some other things I can‚Äôt remember.

Tonight, I went for a walk. The sun was almost down, and I really wanted a coffee so I decided to walk to our local dollar store. It was a thirty-forty minute walk so I knew I could make it before they closed because I‚Äôve done it before. As soon as I‚Äôm out of the driveway and walking up a hill to the main road, I hear something growling and I think it‚Äôs a dog so I keep walking. I start feeling like something‚Äôs following me so I tell myself to just make it the park and I‚Äôll turn back around and lose it on one of the side roads. I‚Äôm texting my friends while this is happening and one of my friend and his mom drives by and asks if I need a ride back home. At this point I‚Äôm basically home and I figured their car scared it off so I tell them I‚Äôm okay and that I‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience but I‚Äôm almost home so I don‚Äôt need it anymore. They turn back around and the moment their cars out of sight I turn and it‚Äôs standing just out of view of the street lamp. It was grey and had weird human animal face with wide eyes that looked sunken in and it looked angry. It was in the position a frog gets in before it jumps for something. I get a horrible feeling in my stomach and I just run. I run so fast and I turn the ten minute walk home into a six minute run and I don‚Äôt stop, I didn‚Äôt even know I fell until my sister pointed out my stained pajamas pants and asked if I fell. I know it followed me home because even after I got inside my dogs were still barking like crazy and start up again every few minutes.

***\*\* Highly Recommended to read through the***¬†[‚ÄúREAD ME‚Äù file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wDBp0r4CumA-YiCDGMq5xeIacXcNaCzY/view?usp=share_link)¬†***through this link. It thoroughly explains the details of these skins and also has a list of recommendations for which skin to use for specific games. \*\****

Another version of the CRT Series for N64 on iPhone. They‚Äôre finally ready with iPad and MacOS versions coming soon! These N64 skins are some of my most complex skins to date! They are CRT style skins that use Core Image Filters to distort the game screen to create a bubble style screen similar to the old CRT televisions. They also feature a reflective bezel, mirroring the game image on the inner edges of the screen bezel. They are definitely not perfect CRT's, but seeing that Delta does not support actual third party shaders this is the closest I could get.

**RELEASE NOTES:**

1. The CRT GAMEPAD versions have no control sets which are intended for use with bluetooth controllers such as a DualShock, Backbone, etc.  
2. Only supports edge-To-Edge iPhones (phones with no home button)¬†

**OVERSCAN & PER GAME RECOMMENDATIONS**¬†

***\*\****¬†*These skins have only been tested and designed for the NTSC / US Rom files. Using Other / PAL formats may or may not look as expected.****\*\****

**What is Overscan? -**¬†Overscan on a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) television is a display setting where the image is intentionally zoomed in, causing the edges of the picture to be cut off and not visible on the screen. This was a common practice on older CRT/Tube TVs.¬†

**Delta N64 Emulator Overscan -**¬†N64 games were designed by game developers to be played on CRT displays which causes some games to have black bars or borders that show on the game emulators like Delta.¬†

* These skins with ‚ÄúOverscan 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0‚Äù are designed to simulate the same behavior to help hide those bars and give a more authentic play experience.¬†
* Each of these skins have different levels of cropping applied to the game screen image. With ‚Äúno overscan‚Äù being as implied, no cropping at all. While ‚Äúoverscan 3.0‚Äù has the most cropping in from the edges.¬†
* Please see the second image in this post for a comparison of Banjo Kazooie with No Overscan skin vs the Overscan 2.0 skin.¬†
* *If you have any requests for specific games to crop out the black borders that these do not work for. Please let me know.*¬†¬†

As always, feedback is always welcome. Good, bad, or ugly. all is welcome ;)

But maybe I should start from the beginning. I‚Äôve had headaches for many years. At one point it was so bad that I went to see my GP. He advised me to stop drinking coffee and tea. That helped for a while‚ÄîI only had headaches a few times a month (related to my menstrual cycle i guess). Unfortunately, the headaches came back.

For over a month now, I‚Äôve had a headache almost every day. I tried to find some reason or trigger, but I have no idea what it could be. Most often the headache appeared around noon. Sometimes I had already eaten something, and sometimes not. Its nothing strange, i usually dont eat breakfast. Recently, for a short while, I thought things were getting better, because even when the headache started, it sometimes went away without taking a pill. Occasionally I took painkillers, but the headache would still be there at bedtime. I went to sleep with a headache, woke up with a headache, but after getting up it would go away after a while.

At one point, I thought maybe it was an issue with my contact lenses. My glasses broke, so I got a prescription for cntact lenses. But I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the cause, because firstly, I wore contact lenses in the past and never had these problems; secondly, during the first month of wearing them I didn‚Äôt have these symptoms; and thirdly, I don‚Äôt wear them on weekends, yet my head still hurts.

Additionally, the last two days have been terrible. As usual, the headache started in the afternoon, but this time it didn‚Äôt go away despite painkillers. The next day I woke up with a headache, and unfortunately it didn‚Äôt stop all day despite taking 2 √ó 2 paracetamol and 2 √ó 2 ibuprofen.

So here‚Äôs my question. The GP prescribed me naproxen, to take one tablet three times a day for a month. But when I read the leaflet, I saw that it‚Äôs not a typical headache medicine. Also, I‚Äôm concerned about the dosage‚Äîthree times a day for a whole month? So far I‚Äôve only taken one tablet. The headache didn‚Äôt go away after it, and I just felt really groggy.",1,1755570609.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

Flavors are testing well, but I‚Äôm struggling to find a co-packer.

I‚Äôve been with Starbucks for almost a year, and it‚Äôs been okay. I don‚Äôt hate my job‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs also not me. I don‚Äôt feel like myself at work. I‚Äôm just going through the motions. I got this job because I love coffee, and I have good customer service experience. But my love for coffee is being killed, and every time I hear the ‚Äòping‚Äô of the drive thru I flinch. It‚Äôs not the company I started working for, and the hustle culture of this company and American workplaces in general is really disheartening to me. My personal philosophy is that patience is key, and most things in the developed world are not so important that they need to happen immediately. So when I live in a world where people can‚Äôt wait 45 seconds for a cup of coffee, and I have to coach people on that, a bit of me dies with every order. It‚Äôs just so. Inconsequential. 

I went to college for music, and worked in the theatre industry for a while, and taught for a bit, but the work is just so unstable. If I left Starbucks, I couldn‚Äôt afford my apartment, let alone afford to take risks like traveling or doing the whole LA/NY thing. I am making good money and living an okay life, but I just feel numb and unfulfilled. Should I leave? How would I go about starting anew?

So, There is this guy(I‚Äôm a guy to and he‚Äôs gay as well) I met about 5-6 months ago and we just kind of met organically because we have mutual hobbies mtg nerd type stuff etc, but we just kind of hit it off and legitimately became closer. It was rough because I caught feelings very early and express my interest and was met with ‚Äúit‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not looking for, but I want to be friends‚Äù and so we stayed friend this was maybe a month in. Fast forward to last week which is maybe month 4 or 5 of our friendship, and I went to grab a coffee with him and awkwardly stumbled through my feelings for him and how it‚Äôs weird for me. I was met with a very similar response like the first time. I honestly don‚Äôt know how I should feel about it because for the first time in my love life I met someone organically, and not on the internet and just saw myself become more and more interested in this individual and loving every aspect of what makes them well them. So I‚Äôve reached a hard impasse because I keep going to them because they enrich my life and make me feel good, but I get kind of beat down internally because it makes me feel inadequate because I‚Äôm just good enough for this level and not anything else ya know.

I am a very introverted and shy person and haven't dated for years. I haven't had much interest, but about three years ago I met a guy at work. For whatever reason, I was drawn to him, and it annoyed me to no extent. We rarely see each other and even more rarely communicate, but he is constantly in my thoughts, infuriating me as it is very unlike me. When I first met him, I was going through a very dark period, which only got worse. My mental health reached breaking point, and I needed an intervention. After a lot of work, I got better, slowly, but I did. I let go of situations and people and so much of my old self, but the one thing I cannot seem to let go of is this guy. 

As hard as I tried, I am not able to get over him. I would try to think about anything else, but he still literally haunts my thoughts and emotions in a very romantic way, and it makes me feel hurt. As I started getting better, about a year and a half ago, I did ask him if we could meet for a coffee just so I could at least communicate with him outside of the workspace and figure out why I was feeling what I was. I do not know this guy, and I assumed that since I have just built him up in my head, once I just speak to him outside of the workplace, I can start to move past him. However, he turned me down by basically not responding and changing the topic. I have never had any idea about his relationship status and don't follow anyone from work on social media. 

I have always known, and still do, that him and I will never happen. I still cannot stop being hung up on him and need some advice on how to move past someone. It is also very unlike me, and I feel stupid for having these feelings for someone I don't even know. I have tried looking for other jobs and have been open to dating even, but neither has worked out. It is a very frustrating experience, especially since I will go weeks without ever even seeing him, but the thoughts persist and always romantic. 

Is there any sort of therapy or exercise that can help me move past this? I have been recommended to date someone, but there has been no progress there either. I would really appreciate any guidance on this issue. ",1,1755570029.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

In Germany, it is customary to round up to the nearest whole dollar. 

Example: 
Check: $102.24 Tip: $17.76 Total: $120

Or
Check: $102.24 Tip: $20 Total: $122.24

Do I have to specify the tip explicitly or is it enough to just enter $120 as the total? 

 Do you tip for services such as takeaway coffee? In Germany, tips are given for good service and not as ""payment"" for the service staff. ",1,1755569498.0,NoStupidQuestions,7,0.67,False

We found a table, sat down, looked at the menu and talked about what drinks we were getting. Our friend‚Äôs 6 year old daughter asked if she could get something and her dad said, ‚Äúno, you‚Äôre not getting anything.‚Äù She looked so upset and I felt bad. It was a Sunday morning at 10am so I thought it was a little cruel to bring her out to a cafe and not let her get anything. My husband and I had planned on eating breakfast so we asked if we could get some muffins for the table. They said yes. We ended up buying a box of 6 muffins and they gave her about 1/4 of one of the muffins. When we got in the car I mentioned to my husband how I didn‚Äôt think it was fair to treat yourself to coffee, but not allow your child anything. My husband said a lot of people are like that because they don‚Äôt want to spend the money. It‚Äôs not a secret that our friends are more on the frugal side. This also isn‚Äôt the first time something like this has happened. I just couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around bringing her out and letting her watch everyone else eat and drink. They also didn‚Äôt bring any other snacks with them for her, just a water bottle. I have never declined my son a treat when we‚Äôre out unless it‚Äôs unreasonable. For instance, he asked if we can get ice cream today at 11am before lunch so I obviously said no. If we‚Äôre out a cafe and I‚Äôm getting something for myself then I always get him something. So my question is, how often are you getting your kids treats? Am I crazy to be spending $5 on a muffin at the local cafes, $4 on a chocolate chip cookie, $6 for an ice cream cone, $7 for a smoothie? Should I be sharing instead? We do treat ourselves multiple times a week so it does add up quick. However, I‚Äôve never thought to say no just to save $5.

I'm a 53M. I had an iron stomach. I was able to eat and drink anything at any time. Never had any issues. I didn't really over drink alcohol but more then we should. I was 167lbs when I just started having reflux at nighttime. In June of 24 out of nowhere. I would get nighttime reflux. Seen a gastro, scoped both ends and no signs of concern. Was told to take PPI's, I tried them for a few weeks and that mad things ever worse. Then they said try a different brand, still no luck. I would have burning all day. I would get some pain in the center of my chest just below the ribs. I had one episode of the same pain in 2017 that lasted one day bet never returned until last June and it was just pain, no reflux. 

Mide July 2024, I changed my diet completely. No butter, fatty dressings, coffee, pop, alcohol, deep fried food, prosses lunch meats, chips, candy. I basically eat fresh veggies and lean beef and grilled chicken. I will eat steak and shrimp ever few weeks as well. I only drink water and some herbal teas now. I'm went down to 140lbs in the 1st 12-16 weeks. (I was 127 lbs when I was 27, I'm just a smaller built guy) Today I'm at 150lbs... Its a good healthy weight for me.

By Mid Aug 24 I cut out all PPI's and worked on my diet and got an adjustable bed. The PPIs felt like they just slowed down my digestion, I felt full for so long and I felt it made it worse for these reasons. No food 2-3hrs before bed. Over time the acid reflux went away but I got LPR or burning was in my throat. Dry and itchy. I battled this until June of 25. I would drink small amounts of alkaline water 9.5 to cancel it without diluting my stomach. I would do this Durning the day and when I woke up at night. This really helped a lot. I hardly ever get ""acid reflux"" symptoms anymore. I get what I think is bile reflux as I can Tast it a little and my teeth, lips and tongue tend to tingle. I would wake up every night needing a drink to relieve the LPR and itchy throat for months.

 Last GI dock apt was Mar of 25 and although I was doing better off the PPi's he suggested I keep doing what I'm doing and give it time. He ordered Barium swallow and Fibro scan, both were great, No issues. F/scan was like 1.5. He said I had a small hiatal hernia.

June of 25, had all organs ultrasound. Everything looked good. My whole life I've had high hemoglobin 18/9 range and low platelets 99-110 rage. My blood doc says I have thick blood or too much blood. We keep an eye on things.

I wanted to look into posable repairs for the hiatal hernia, so I did some research and found a specialist for digestive health who's is Director, Esophageal and Swallowing Center, Digestive Health, Director, Metabolic and Bariatric Nutrition Center Director, Bariatric Surgery. It took while to get in and see this Doc. but I wanted to see one that could really help. I was able to see the Doc Aug of 25. At this time, I'm feel about 85%, much better than a year ago. No burring in the throat. I ask the Doc about the hiatal hernia. Doc said I didn't have one, looking at all my past tests and xrays. I was told I needed my G/bladder removed. I was confused at first. They Ordered the HIDA scan,Test was at 7am. It came back at a 94..... I had no pian or discomfort during the test. If any it lasted just a few min near the 2 hour of the test. I ate right after with no issues.  I did feel off that night, but I think that was the overflow of bile on an empty stomach from the test that worked it was through my system. 

Now they want to remove my gallbladder. My biggest concern is that it doesn't resolve my issues and even makes more issues. I currently get mild discomfort in my upper right back and collar bone. mostly back. Sometimes a little discomfort in my middle right belly. I feel If I wait another 6 months, I may even get better. Mostly feel off when hungry or 4-6 hours after eating. Almost always feel better when I eat. Feel good when I wake up. Never have upset stomach in the morning. Not too often at night. 3 times a month now, if that. 

Could this be my liver causing the gallbladder to over work? My body making bile trying to get rid of my blood? My biggest fear is getting bile reflux that will not go away after removal and then I'm stuck. 

What other tests can I ask for? I can always have it removed latter if I go downhill again but I can't put it back. I have a fallow up next week. I'd like to try and retest in 6 months and see if I can turn it around? Has anyone ever recovered without removal?

1mu5q0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1mu5q0t/post_op_better_than_expected/,Post op - better than expected!,"47F just had my first colonoscopy this morning. I‚Äôve been dreading it for almost 10 years, ever since I helped my husband get thru his first. A friend of mine told me about getting hers done recently and gave me a whole pep talk, which helped me get over the hurdle of scheduling. I‚Äôm hoping if I share my story it‚Äôll give others similar inspiration.

Based on my friend‚Äôs account, my two worries were the fasting and the anesthesia. But the fasting day was really no trouble with the right expectations. Fortunately my surgery center only does colonoscopies on Mondays, which means you have to fast on Sunday, which hopefully means you don‚Äôt have to go to work. I planned to spend the day studying, which worked great for distraction from hunger ‚Äî I was very focused and productive.

The night before fasting day I carb-loaded with a hearty spaghetti meal, as if I were doing an endurance race. I think this helped a lot to curb feelings of hunger on fasting day. 

I had my coffee in the morning like usual along with a cup of bone broth ‚Äî this stuff is vile going down, but my empty stomach needs protein first thing in the morning and not sugar. That was definitely the way to go. Had a great dump. I think the caffeine helped suppress appetite. Had some diet soda midday.

I kept myself busy throughout the day by constantly sipping something with calories in it, mostly fruit juice, to keep my blood sugar up so I didn‚Äôt get cranky. Had some jello when I felt the urge to chew, and more bone broth every few hours to settle my stomach.

Three pills of Dulcolax laxative at 4pm, didn‚Äôt notice any effect. First 10oz bottle of magnesium citrate at 5pm. Lemon flavor. Very sour. Monstered through it. Started feeling unsettled in my stomach almost right away. Started evacuating around 7pm. Had to take the other bottle of magnesium citrate at 8pm. Cherry. Less vile but still sour. Had my final round of bone broth shortly after; do not recommend, I was burping up bone broth for hours afterwards as my guts started to rebel.

Between 9 and 10, multiple trips to the bathroom. Went to bed at 10, got up again right away. It was starting to feel urgent, like norovirus level. Slept 11-2, toilet again. 3am toilet. 4:15 alarm went off. Showered, drove to surgery for 5:45 check-in. Got there early; got signed in as first patient of the day. This part was awesome! Everything happened fast. 

I was worried about my guts the whole time I was waiting for the procedure to start; at my 2am wake-up I was starting to feel dehydrated and had a cup of water, which seemed like it made everything worse. I wish they would be a little more clear in pre-op instructions that they WANT you dehydrated. I felt like my runs slowed and my guts calmed down just in the nick of time. My mouth was pretty parched though.

I was anxious all the way up to the start of surgery about the Propofol. Just existential dread about not waking up again or not going under in time. But the surgery team was fresh and relaxed and music was playing and they dimmed the lights, it was very relaxing. The nurse put on my oxygen mask and had me roll on my side and said ‚ÄúTime to go to sleep,‚Äù and I felt a cold/burning sensation in the IV in my hand, and then I got some crazy green snakeskin pattern in my vision and had a euphoric feeling like ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm going to Burning Man!‚Äù and then I was gone. It wasn‚Äôt the blink of an eye, more like a good nap. Woke up in recovery. I was woozy and lightheaded for a couple hours, but through the whole day I‚Äôve been more upbeat than usual, I think a side effect of the Propofol. 

Overall, prep, specifically the gut cramping and urgent diarrhea combining into severe sleep deprivation, was the worst part. Ironically, the parts I was worried about, I was mentally ready for, and they went great.

Best part: I have a gorgeous unblemished colon, no concerns whatsoever. As the Dr said, he‚Äôs giving me a 10-year warranty. Woohoo!!

Also, thank you very very much for any feedback I can get here. I feel like a 16 year old again üòÖ just a lot more matured now‚Ä¶

So I go get my coffee from this place, this woman takes my order, my first instinct was not to ask for her number, she was nice but I thought she was just being nice because she‚Äôs taking my order. But then she goes out of her way the next time to talk to me, then she squeezed in between 2 co workers at the window to talk to me, so I asked for her name and went on my way‚Ä¶

Then I go in again, this time though, to see if she‚Äôs interested‚Ä¶I go 5 times in a row and the opportunity wasn‚Äôt there. 

Now, it‚Äôs Friday, I had her name, I search her on insta, in my head, I was trying to shoot my shot all week and it just wasn‚Äôt working out. So I sent a follow request.

THEN, the very next day‚Ä¶guess who brings me out my drink!? So I ask her what I‚Äôve been trying to ask all week and she says yes! Then she asks if that was me who requested the day before‚Ä¶I of course said yes and I started talking too much, there was a line behind me, she had to go, then I realize I never even asked for her number‚Ä¶can‚Äôt lie, patience probably would have helped me there.

So I‚Äôm like, well she knows I requested to follow her. She‚Äôll just accept it and I‚Äôll DM her. Well she didn‚Äôt. So I just messaged anyways later that day. That was Saturday‚Ä¶then Sunday comes around and I‚Äôm telling my buddy about it and he says she would have accepted it by now if she was going to‚Ä¶so I canceled the request‚Ä¶

I drive through today with my cousin, I see the girl I‚Äôve been interested in as we pull in from the other side, we get our order taken, pull up to the window, I‚Äôm looking through the window towards the back to see if I can see her, I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶but I look back in front of me, see 3 of the girls looking directly at me, smiling and whispering to each other..I just half smiled back knowing full well they were talking about me‚Ä¶hopefully it was good üòÖ

Overall, I think overthinking this. I‚Äôm infatuated is probably the best description.

To add, it‚Äôs not beauty that got me interested which is normally how it would go. It wasn‚Äôt until after the 3rd short conversation that I started paying real attention to her. I‚Äôve seen her plenty of times before and never thought anything of it. Now I look at her and she‚Äôs just more beautiful with each time I see her. Maybe 10 years ago in high school I felt excited like this. My experience has always been very indifferent if they said yes or no. Even during the dates with others I thought were super attractive, I just enjoyed the date with them and was fine whatever direction it went. Not butterflies in my stomach like this‚Ä¶

is this normally how it goes? Am I just  overthinking this? I almost wasn‚Äôt going to go in the rest of the week after the girls doing that. At first I thought it might be a good sign since that‚Äôs the only thing I can think of as to why they‚Äôd do that and would mean she told them‚Ä¶ But also maybe it‚Äôs bad?

My husband only has kids over the age of 18. His youngest son, 20 years, is living with his grandma by choice. I've known him for two years, he's kind of bad news. 

When he lived here, he would leave molding and dirty dishes around the house and tell me, his stepmom, and his sisters to clean them up. He would scam the house members of money. He would tell his dad I was screaming at him when I'd calmly tell him to clean up the living room (he would spend days there on the couch playing video games with gross dishes and visibly in need of a shower). He's thrown things at me, screamed at me, punched walls and couches in order to intimidate me.

Today he has come over unannounced when we weren't going to be home and we just came home on pure chance. Then told me ""but I called dad and asked if I could come over"". I was on that phone call with him because my husband was driving. I answered the phone call and just put it on speaker so that he could speak while driving. He apparently didn't know I was on the phone call. He didn't ask to come over. There was no other phone call between then and when he came over, I was with him. But because everyone (except me) has Life360, he knows when everyone else is home because it shows their location. So he waited until he knew his dad was home, ran over, then when I asked why he was sprawled out on the couch, he said ""I called and asked dad to come over"" even though he didn't. 

I don't understand, why lie? Why not just actually ask? 

I found out that he texted his older sister who lives with us and just came home 7 hours later. He just said ""I'm coming over"". That's not a question. And that wasn't his Dad. She was at work and unable to message us and he knew she was at work and not able to say no.

He's not allowed over here without me and his dad being here because he tends to bully people with his manipulative crap. And unannounced is a no-go. Every time I'm alone with him, like say his dad leaves the room, he takes the chance to insult me. He literally raced indoors, when his dad was walking to the car to get me coffee from McDonald's, to call me pretentious for wanting iced coffee. The one little window he had to do so because his dad was taking him with him. I absolutely refuse to be alone with him because before that, he berated me and called me stupid for not knowing the directions to his grandmother's house when I was being kind enough to give him a ride over there. Then lied to his dad saying it didn't happen. 

Sometimes I just don't know what to do. I refuse to go to his grandmother's house for this reason. When he realized he wasn't allowed to be alone with me, not because we said something but because I stopped coming around where he was, he created a situation to provoke me. It's getting ridiculous.

I am thinking about asking my psychiatrist to taper my off my adhd meds, guanfacine. I think my pre-disease body would like it but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs interacting with my nervous system right now. I started having rhythmic tremors the last 6 weeks.

Plaquenil has began making its impact on body pain (except face, throat neck) but I‚Äôm only 4 weeks in.

Here are my current supplements and they help me 



 Daily Core:
    ‚Ä¢    Vitamin D3 with K2
    ‚Ä¢    Methylated B12
    ‚Ä¢    Vitamin B6
    ‚Ä¢    Taurine‚Äî-honestly haven‚Äôt felt a difference 
    ‚Ä¢    Calcium
          Histamine X probiotics 
    ‚Ä¢    iron biglycinate with Vitamin C 
    ‚Ä¢    Collagen (adding back in; for gut, skin, joint, tissue support)
    ‚Ä¢    Fish oil 
    ‚Ä¢    Magnesium malate (as needed, like restless or hurting) 
       

Meds 
Plaquenil 
Prozac
Guanfacine‚Äî-checking to see if it exhausts me too much right now.

My next set of trials are for gut healing

Pomegranate peel powder (polyphenols)
Green tea (polyphenols, coffee may be too irritating for me)
L-Glutamine
White peony extract
Zinc


Side note: some studies show that L-Lactis is an immunomodulator 

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll do if the ADHD rebounds. I think I‚Äôd rather deal with that If the meds are making me too tired.

What do you use or recommend?  I know everyone‚Äôs symptoms are different. 

Below are the studies as to why I chose supplements.

Well, you‚Äôre here so maybe that means he‚Äôs here lurking on my Reddit post. üòÇüòå

I am looking for a connection that could lead to something real, long term. I want someone who is just themselves. A man who is generous, emotional intelligent, open minded , doesn‚Äôt mind banter/sarcasm.

I am the type of person who enjoys learning new things skills, hobbies, knowledge. I have watched way too much television and I have no shame in that. I like to bake, collect entirely too many mugs & books, trips to the farms market, coffee shops and thrifting. I am sometimes more reserved when meeting people. I feel like the people who know me best would say I‚Äôm animated , a total goofball, bubbly, open minded, hard exterior big heart, naturing. I do love music definitely a r&b, indie and pop person but I love all types of music. I am in the US, Texas specifically you can be located anywhere.

If I sound the least bit interesting feel free to shoot me a message.

1mu578v,https://i.redd.it/wkpqyj8esvjf1.jpeg,Getting ready to travel and want to do it like Skyrim.,"My spouse and I are getting ready to leave the US in a short bit and do some traveling.  We‚Äôll probably film it because it‚Äôs what one DOES these days. And we will probably post to YouTube or something because that sounds fun.

But, because I can‚Äôt live my life like a wretched travel vlogger, I wish to do this travel Skyrim-coded. 

Inspired initially by a poster to this sub who talked about his Skyrim diet and how he eats nothing but foods that one would find in Skyrim, we want to attempt that kind of lifestyle while on the road. 

Initially we were talking about the diet and how it would be nice, but we would be traveling. We decided to try it on the road anyway. And, in for a penny - in for a Septim, decided to try to live a Skyrim kind of life on the road.

This is where I‚Äôm looking for suggestions. This idea is in its infancy and we leave in a week, cruising from Alaska to Vancouver BC.  (The cruise isn‚Äôt Skyrim-coded as such, but perhaps there will be plenty of chops and steaks.) We have no return date and no destination post Vancouver.

If this was you, HOW would you live a Skyrim kind of life while out on the road? Money IS an object and the less we spend the longer we can travel.  I am also disabled with mobility issues, so walking the globe, while incredibly Skyrim, isn‚Äôt too feasible.

Looking for creative suggestions since not every place in the world looks like Skyrim.

I feel like cars are the equivalence of wagons, and planes are like fast travel. Dumplings are Skyrim appropriate the world over and there is meat, fish, fruit and vegetables everywhere.  Avoiding rice in SE Asia makes me sad, but if I salt it, it could be saltrice maybe? Also a red bean bun would be transcendent, but no beans? And no coffee or tea? How would you all do this!? 

I have a housecarl to carry my burdens. What now?!",25,1755567800.0,skyrim,10,0.93,False

He‚Äôd been posting skits for *months*‚Äîdumb challenges, storytimes, even prank calls‚Äîbut nothing ever landed. Then he filmed a throwaway bit about finding twenty bucks on the ground. That very night, on his way to the store, he spotted a crumpled twenty dollar bill by the curb. 

*Same* torn corner he‚Äôd faked in the video.

He picked it up, brushing the corner with his hand. ‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù A shaky laugh slipped out as he flipped it once, then again. ‚ÄúChat‚Äôs gonna *flip*.‚Äù

That night, he went live. ‚ÄúYo, I *swear* this just happened,‚Äù he told his viewers, holding up the bill. ‚ÄúI joked about it, and then it was *outside*.‚Äù

The chat exploded.

‚Äú*Do it, post it*.‚Äù 

‚Äú*Use your powers*ü´¶‚Äù 

‚Äú*Don‚Äôt let us down bro*.‚Äù

The next morning, half to prove them wrong, he filmed a skit about running into his crush at the coffee shop. Corny dialogue, soft background track, him fumbling the order like some bad rom-com.

By lunch, she was *there*. She walked into the shop and slid into the seat across from him like it was nothing. Trevor almost dropped his cup. His heart pounded so hard he swore she could hear it.

After that, he *knew*. He didn‚Äôt know how or why but he was finally getting noticed.

He tried to keep it small‚Äîjokes about the weather, a skit about winning a scratch-off. Harmless stuff, just enough to keep the crowd entertained. But when every single one came true, his followers *climbed*.

They clipped his reactions, sent rewards, *begged* him to post more. Trevor soaked in the attention‚Äîuntil the suggestions started getting *sharper*.

‚Äú*Im blocking you*.‚Äù

‚Äú*Do something exciting*.‚Äù

‚Äú*Fall off king* üò≠.‚Äù

The pressure was relentless. He decided one night he‚Äôd had enough. Went live to tell them he wasn‚Äôt creating anymore. The chat flooded in instantly.

‚Äú*Boring* ü§ß.‚Äù

From the hidden layer of reality known as The Fold‚Ä¶","It happened in Sacramento, late one night during light rain fall. I‚Äôd stepped out for a cigarette. I remember the streetlight flickering above me like it was trying to stay awake. The air had that muggy, heaviness to it, and the sidewalk shone like Chapter 1.¬† ""The Man with the White Eyes""

obsidian glass.

I noticed the street light again, this time I heard a humming sound. It was faint and sounded like electric static. I could almost feel the electric current. As I looked at the light it looked like it got hit by a small bolt of lightning, then dropped to the ground. That‚Äôs when I saw him.

He was standing at the edge of the alley, half in shadow, half in the buzzing yellow spill of a streetlamp. He didn‚Äôt walk up. He didn‚Äôt move. He was just suddenly *there*‚Äîlike he'd blinked into existence.

¬†

I thought maybe he was homeless. Maybe high. His clothes didn‚Äôt quite fit‚Äîa black windbreaker zipped up too tight, jeans too short at the ankles. Shoes with no laces. He wasn‚Äôt wet from the rain, though. That struck me. I shrugged it off, I took my phone out of my pocket to check emails and scroll through YouTube. The whole time it felt eyes on me, like this invisible force of energy nudging me. I looked over to the strange guy staring at me.

Something told me to ignore him, but I also had this intense feeling to engage and that‚Äôs when curiosity got me. So, I waved and said,

‚ÄúHey man,‚Äù nodding casually. ‚ÄúCan I help you with something?‚Äù I felt it was a normal thing to say to someone that is just staring at you.

That‚Äôs when I noticed his eyes.

They were white‚Äîmilky, no iris. But inside each white dome was a single black dot. Tiny. Too tiny. They didn‚Äôt blink. They didn‚Äôt *move*. They just stared, dead-on, like he was looking *through* me.

Still, I kept my cool. Maybe he was blind. Maybe he was wearing contacts. Maybe this was all fine.

He didn‚Äôt answer. Just opened his mouth.

And kept it open.

No sound at first. Just a wide, gaping mouth with teeth too small and too many of them, like a shark‚Äôs baby teeth trying to organize themselves into a smile.

Then, in my head, I *heard* it.

Not with my ears. It was like the words were *inserted* into my thoughts, like someone whispering in a room next to my soul:

**""Are you ready to go?""**

I froze. The cigarette fell from my hand. My lungs felt cold, like I‚Äôd inhaled something sharp and wet. I didn‚Äôt answer. I just turned and walked fast, not running. But I could feel it. That... *thing* wasn‚Äôt moving, but its presence was following me like a stink on my clothes.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.

And I haven‚Äôt really slept since.

It‚Äôs been weeks. And now, wherever I go, any reflection, any crowd, any window, I see those eyes. Just for a second. In the background. Watching.

Sometimes I hear the question again, just before sleep hits:

**""Are you ready to go?""**

¬†

¬†

Chapter 2. Origin.

¬†

So what the hell is this entity supposed to be?

The Pale One is a **Reclaimer**, a corrupted **psychopomp**, and a **Chronophage**‚Äîa being from a hidden layer of reality known as **The Fold**. The Fold is a non-linear, extradimensional archive where all potential versions of reality are stored. It is where dead timelines go to die. It is where forgotten souls linger. It is where beings like *it* wait.

The Pale One was once a guide between life and death, a necessary force. But after eons in the Fold, exposed to discarded realities and collapsed timelines, it changed. It became curious. Hungry.

It began to slip out of the Fold‚Äînot to reclaim the dead, but to feed on the **living** who are closest to being erased: the lonely, the broken, the ones who linger at the edge of existence.

I was exposed to something‚Äîsomeone‚Äîdying near me. Maybe I didn‚Äôt know it. A passing car accident. A dying man in a neighboring apartment. The Fold opened slightly, and it slipped through.

But when I engaged it, I did something that‚Äôs almost never done: I acknowledged it. Most people ignore the Pale One. Most can‚Äôt see it clearly. But I spoke to it. That act marked me as anchored‚Äîas real.

And now, it follows me. Not because I‚Äôm dead‚Ä¶ but because I‚Äôm not‚Äîyet.

¬†

Chapter 3. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the Walls‚Äù

I‚Äôve never felt so uneasy and unsettling before. That face, his disturbing appearance.

Eyes: White, with pinprick black pupils. The pupils are windows into lost timelines.

Face: Unmoving. Its expression mimics what it believes humans look like‚Äîbut is subtly wrong.

Voice: It does not speak aloud. Its words are invasive thoughts‚Äîtelepathic projections etched into the subconscious.

Mouth: When it opens its mouth, it reveals not just teeth‚Äîbut static. Inside is a sound, a frequency, that induces vertigo, nausea, or memory loss.

¬†

**""I think it's inside the walls now.""**

That was the first thing I said out loud after the third night without sleep. My own voice startled me. It‚Äôs been a few months now dealing with a fucked up sleeping pattern.

I hadn‚Äôt told anyone about what happened in Sacramento‚Äînot the guy with the eyes, not the telepathic question, not the smell of wet dust and static that lingered in the air even after I left. I tried to forget. But that only made it worse.

It started small.

Things moved when I wasn‚Äôt looking. Not big things, nothing dramatic. Just... the toothpaste cap twisted on backwards. The hallway light left on when I *knew* I‚Äôd turned it off. A receipt from a store I‚Äôd never visited sitting on my kitchen counter, dated three years ago.

Then came the time slips.

A man on the street greeted me by name‚Äîcalled me ""Eli."" That‚Äôs not my name.

A voicemail appeared on my phone. Just breathing. Then static. Then my own voice asking, ‚Äú**Are you ready to go?**‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember recording it. I *never* recorded it.

And the dreams... they weren‚Äôt dreams anymore.

I‚Äôd wake up and the walls of my apartment would be bleeding light. Not red. Not white. A kind of pale *absence*. Like something was shining from a place where light doesn‚Äôt belong. I‚Äôd hear whispering in the pipes. Not words, just *intent*. A pulling sensation.

I tried salt. Incense. Cameras. They all shorted out. One photo I took of the hallway came back with someone in the background‚Äîjust barely visible.

A figure in a black jacket, face turned. White eyes. Tiny pupils. Like someone took a needle to a snow globe.

**I stopped using mirrors.**

They lagged behind my movements. In one, I was still brushing my teeth long after I‚Äôd finished. Sometimes, the reflection smiled when I didn‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore.

I found a notebook in my closet yesterday‚Äîone I don‚Äôt remember writing in. The handwriting is mine, but the ink is faded and the paper looks decades old. Inside it, a message repeated page after page:

**Don‚Äôt speak to it. Don‚Äôt answer. Don‚Äôt look back. Don‚Äôt forget who you are.**

And then, on the last page, something new, written just recently:

**It already knows.**

Tonight, I heard footsteps in my apartment. Not outside. **Inside**. But when I checked every room, nothing. Then I saw it.

Not the whole thing.

Just its **reflection**‚Äîin the TV screen, turned off. Standing behind me.

It didn‚Äôt move. But I swear... I think it was smiling now.

¬†

Chapter 4. Breaking Time.

¬†

¬†**I stopped dreaming.**

But something‚Äîsomething else‚Äî*keeps dreaming through me.*

When I blink, sometimes it‚Äôs longer than it should be. I close my eyes for a second and when I open them, I‚Äôm somewhere else. In a room I don‚Äôt recognize. With walls that seem to breathe in slow, damp pulses. With *shapes* that don‚Äôt belong. With photographs on the wall‚Äîof people with no faces. Just smooth skin stretched where their features should be.

Then I blink again, and I‚Äôm back.

I started recording my time. Bought a dozen clocks, put them in every room. But sometimes they don‚Äôt match. I‚Äôll lose three minutes in the bathroom. Seventeen seconds walking from the kitchen to the hallway. Once, I stood at my front door and watched the second hand of my watch just *stop*. Then it ticked backwards. Three times.

**I think time‚Äôs beginning to break.**

Or maybe just *my* time.

I started noticing things. Patterns. The number **12** keeps showing up. Emails at 12:12 AM. License plates ending in 1212. A receipt where the total came to $12.12‚Äîon a bill I didn‚Äôt remember paying.

I think that‚Äôs when I saw it again. Not in the flesh. Not directly.

But in the **corner of my eye**, always just out of focus. Like it‚Äôs stitching itself into my **peripheral reality**. If I look too fast, I miss it. But if I don‚Äôt look at all, I feel it *grin*.

Then came **The Fold**.

It opened last night. I know how insane that sounds. But I wasn‚Äôt dreaming.

There was a crack in my bedroom wall. A literal, physical crack‚Äîlike the plaster had been split. But through it‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt see drywall. I didn‚Äôt see wood or wiring.

I saw **movement**.

Something was folding and unfolding, infinitely‚Äîlike geometry collapsing in on itself. Spirals made of shadows. The sound of breathing from a mouth too wide. And somewhere in that darkness, **those eyes**.

It asked me again‚Äîno voice, just pressure behind my eyes:

**‚ÄúAre you ready to go?‚Äù**

But this time‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt walk away.

I said:

‚ÄúWhat happens if I say yes?‚Äù

And I swear to God, the crack **grew**.

**Now I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs real.**

I walked outside this morning and none of the cars had license plates. I passed a man sitting on the curb with no shadow. The sun was in the sky, but the birds were flying backwards. I watched a woman walk into a coffee shop twice‚Äîsame dress, same steps, same cough.

The Pale One isn‚Äôt just following me anymore.

It‚Äôs **rewriting me**.

My husband and I had the weekend off together and did go do some things. His friend invited us out on his boat Friday (though this had nothing to do with it being my birthday) we got a meal on the way home and I got a slice of cake. Then we went out to a rave that night that was loosely for my birthday I suppose. We had talked previously about doing some mdma together on my birthday weekend so that‚Äôs what that was. Then Saturday was really just recovering from that hanging out at home. 

Sunday a friend came over in the morning and we went out to the river together without my husband as a girls day/birthday hang out. That evening at the house later I made dinner for the two of us and we watched tv/played video games. 

Today is my actual birthday. My husband had to work. He ended up being able to only work a part day and he came home at noon and we went and got a sandwich at a place we both really like. He did also schedule a FaceTime call with two of our good friends and they sang happy birthday to me together and we all chatted for a bit until it was time for dinner earlier tonight. 

At two points today I mentioned ‚Äúso did you get me a card or something?‚Äù Because I was starting to feel upset that I didn‚Äôt get one. Both times I brought it up he held up his finger and told me I have to wait, so I assumed I had one coming. ‚Ä¶but I did not. He just got the dog to go to bed and I started just crying. We have a lot of things coming up and I didn‚Äôt expect him to spend a bunch of money but I‚Äôm really upset he didn‚Äôt even bother with getting me a card. Especially with what happened last year. 

(Back story) Last year during his birthday I was dealing with some severe back pain and didn‚Äôt put much effort into his birthday that year. I got him some books he asked for off of Amazon and gave it to him in the shipping packaging. He was very upset with me for not doing more for him‚Ä¶. So I guess with that I just expected a little more? Like from that conversation last year I thought we both agreed to put in more effort for each other. I mean, just a card and something small to open, it didn‚Äôt need to be expensive or a lot. 

He also has already told me (several weeks ago) that he wants to have a ‚Äúsurprise birthday party‚Äù when our friends are in town about a week before his birthday and an espresso machine that ‚ÄúI have plenty of time to save up for‚Äù.  So it just feels like he‚Äôs expecting a lot from me, but he didn‚Äôt put in the effort for me. 

I told him my feelings were hurt and he said that we spent the weekend together and did things and he even came home early to take me to get lunch together. He told me he didn‚Äôt have time to get a card yet but he knows when my birthday is and even Friday he went out for coffee in the morning by himself and could have last minute got one then.

All of us at the coroner‚Äôs office had been putting in some serious overtime, since the hurricane had hit the coast.¬† The news said it was the worst ever recorded.¬† Rain still poured down, and the streets were half flooded even if you weren‚Äôt in the storm surge.¬† Our facility was close to capacity, and we needed to get those bodies properly ID‚Äôd before sending them to a morgue.

What I was dealing with here was something different.¬† A day after the storm hit, this particular body was recovered from a street flooded with the surge.¬† When we ran prints, he had an exceptional criminal record, and the finger-width hole was assumed to be from a bullet.¬† A plausible conclusion would be that he was looting.

Things weren‚Äôt adding up, though.¬† What had been labelled an entry wound looked a lot more like an exit wound to me.¬† It was larger, rougher, and didn‚Äôt have any abrasion from the bullet entry.¬† Details like that were unreliable on bodies that had been in the water for a while, but I saw no evidence of bacterial decomposition.¬† It was also a bit strange that the man had clawed at the entry, but I supposed it was a reaction to the pain.

There was a simple solution to this puzzle: if it was a gunshot wound with no exit, there would be a bullet.

I turned him onto his back.¬† Normally, someone would have helped me, but we were totally swamped.¬† Rolling over a dead body weighing more than you do is hard work, but this wasn‚Äôt my first rodeo.¬† I started the Y-incision to open up the chest and abdominal cavities.

‚ÄúReally?¬† You‚Äôre doing that *now*?‚Äù

Flynn was about 14 hours into his shift.¬† I couldn‚Äôt blame him for wanting to get the easier bodies out of there and keeping the rest on ice so he could go home.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the doc, I call the shots.¬† I‚Äôm working on this one, but I can do it alone.¬† You just keep processing those others.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah.‚Äù

His voice was resigned, not resentful.¬† Shoulders shrugged in his scrubs, I didn‚Äôt need to see behind the surgical mask to know he was frowning.¬† This was a tough week for all of us.

Once I‚Äôd gotten the abdomen open, I started checking his left side.¬† The first thing I noticed was that the kidney was missing.

A lot of people only have one kidney.¬† That wasn‚Äôt what I was looking at.¬† Both arteries and the ureter had been severed.¬† Perhaps the bullet had passed through those, since there was notable tissue damage and internal bleeding.¬† However, the condition of the connective tissues meant that he still had the kidney until very recently, and bullets don‚Äôt make organs disappear.

So what *does* make organs disappear?

Perhaps it had moved around, once it wasn‚Äôt attached to anything.¬† Stranger things had happened.¬† The whole abdomen had to be examined anyway, so I just carried¬† on, figuring I would find it at some point.

I discovered a large hole in the liver.¬† Removing the deep red organ carefully, I turned it over in my hands.¬† There was only one hole.¬† If a bullet was in him, it would be there.

It felt heavy, the cold wet mass wanting to slip from my gloves.¬† Normally, I would expect a liver this large to be fatty, but didn‚Äôt look like it.¬† Curious, I put it on the scale.¬† 2.4 Kg.¬† That was big.

I went to write the weight down, and to take a break.¬† Normally, an assistant would do it.¬† I took off my gloves to write notes on everything so far, massaging my stiff neck for a moment.¬† When I checked the clock, it was 10:45 PM.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm grabbing a coffee, you want one?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes please.¬† Actually, if it‚Äôs not too much trouble can you grab me a water, too?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood idea.‚Äù

Flynn was right.¬† I‚Äôd forgotten to drink any water, or eat, or do anything but work the last five hours or so.¬† I poured a couple of coffees and tucked two water bottles into my pockets.¬† Making my way back down the fluorescent white hallway, I shouldered through heavy doors that pushed open from either side.¬† They were convenient for moving bodies, or when you were carrying multiple beverages.

‚ÄúYou doing alright?‚Äù¬† I asked.

‚ÄúDoing just fine.¬† Appreciate the drinks, Doc.‚Äù¬† He gave a nod.

I downed the entire water bottle in one go, then drank about half of my coffee.¬† I checked my phone for anything from my husband.

*Text me when you‚Äôre heading home.¬† Love u!!*

He was probably asleep already.¬† Sleep sounded pretty good, but I had a kidney to find.¬† I put on my labcoat, gloves, mask, and glasses.

Seeing the liver, I froze in confusion.¬† In the sterile white light, it looked deflated.¬† This had been a long shift, but I wasn‚Äôt imagining things.¬† My notes said 2.4 Kg, but the scale now read 1.1 Kg.¬† Hurrying over, I stared at the green LED numbers, as if they might change again.

I was about to pick the liver back up when I noticed a wet, dark trail streaking from the metal plate of the scale, onto the counter, then down to the tile floor.

‚ÄúFlynn, can you come look at this?‚Äù

I‚Äôd tried to sound calm, but the rapidity with which Flynn came over suggested that I had not succeeded.

‚ÄúWhat am I looking at?‚Äù¬† He asked.

‚ÄúI weighed that liver at 2.4, wrote it down, got us coffees, and when I came back it weighed 1.1 and there‚Äôs this trail going across the floor.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ part of it fell?‚Äù

His conclusion was rational, but not correct.

‚ÄúIf it fell, why did it leave a trail that goes half way across the room before fading out?¬† Also, I feel compelled to mention that the body was in the water.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù¬† His voice was low, and concerned.¬† ‚ÄúThis is bullet hole guy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep.‚Äù

We stood there looking at the gruesome trail, a smear which started dark and clear at the scale, but was untraceable about halfway across the room.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to find it, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù¬† His eyes were visibly concerned, even behind the goggles.

Of course he was right.¬† But the question was not whether we had to find it, rather what ‚Äòit‚Äô was.¬† There was a growing certainty in my mind that ‚Äòit‚Äô was not an inanimate object, but rather a living organism.

I‚Äôm not a squeamish person.¬† There‚Äôs no need to go into details here, but I‚Äôve seen a lot of things working as a coroner.¬† There are a lot of insects associated with decomposing bodies, sure.¬† None of those insects are 1.3 kilograms.

‚ÄúMy best guess is that it‚Äôs an eel.¬† Check the floor, get everything it could crawl under away from the walls.¬† Slither under.¬† Whatever eels do on land.¬† It can‚Äôt have gone far.‚Äù

We checked the small space under the cabinets, all around the room.¬† I checked under the instrument table, everywhere I could think of.

I jumped when I heard metal clatter to the floor.¬† Flynn cursed.¬† My first instinct was that the creature had knocked something down, but Flynn had just bumped a tray accidentally.¬† I could tell his nerves were thin, as were mine.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not here.‚Äù¬† He said.¬† ‚ÄúDo you want me to check the next room?‚Äù

I glanced at the doorway.¬† The rubber sweeps on the base of the door looked secure, I doubted anything could have gotten through.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just slow down and think for a second.‚Äù

The whole search had been a panicked reaction.¬† When we had started, my intuition had been that whatever had come out of the man‚Äôs liver would be laying on the floor somewhere.¬† Since it wasn‚Äôt, we would need a new strategy.

‚ÄúBlacklight.‚Äù¬† I said.

Behind his mask, Flynn nodded in agreement, quickly going to a drawer and pulling out a blacklight shaped like a baton, with two long bulbs encased in a plastic frame.¬† He flipped it on, carefully walking toward the scale.

The trail glowed a sinister yellow green.¬† Initially, the dark smears were obvious even to the naked eye, but where they had first seemed to disappear now lay a faint, glowing trail.

‚ÄúWhat are those little marks along both sides? Do eels have like‚Ä¶ flippers?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think some of them do.‚Äù

Perhaps my voice indicated it, but looking at this strange track, I was becoming less confident we were searching for an eel.¬† When the trail meandered across the floor toward a gurney, a nauseous feeling started in my stomach.¬† As it went up the wheel, then coiled around the stainless steel leg, acid began to enter my throat.

A closed body bag lay at the end of the blacklight‚Äôs trail.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre turning the body over.‚Äù

Flynn didn‚Äôt want to, but he nodded.¬† We turned the black bag over on the stainless steel gurney, and I found what I was looking for.

A finger-sized hole through the plastic.

‚ÄúOh God.‚Äù¬† Flynn‚Äôs hand went to cover his mouth in horror, but his reflexes stopped the rubber glove a few inches short.

‚ÄúAlright.¬† Take it to the freezer.¬† Fast, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

With no hesitation we pushed the gurney, the body bag, the body, and whatever was inside it through the swinging doors, then turned down the hall.¬† With one hand on the gurney, I reached out for the long, horizontal handle on the stainless steel doors of the insulated freezer room.

I was in denial when I felt something sharp on my glove.¬† It had to be the zipper on the bag, I told myself.¬† As my head whipped around, Flynn screamed.¬† A breathy ‚Äòhah‚Äô noise escaped my lips.

The front of it had some kind of teeth or mandibles, evenly spaced and radiating from what must have been its mouth.¬† Behind that small sharp legs, perhaps an inch long, were going across the back of my glove.¬† They must have been sharp, because they had easily cut through the nitrile and left small pinpricks of blood.¬† The whole thing was jointed, armored, looked like bone.

All of this I tell you from memory.¬† Part of me wants to think that I misremembered the thing on the back of my hand, but I know what I saw.¬† It burned into my retinas like a photograph, even though I violently flung my hand the moment I saw it.

Pointed legs dug into my skin, and the length of the monstrosity was pulled out from the body bag and flung across the hall, as I shook my arm as hard as I could in panic.¬† It left a wet mark where it hit the wall, then flopped to the ground.¬† Before I knew it, the thing had scurried toward the exit doors, legs scratching at the base of them, then found a tiny gap right in the middle.¬† As it forced its way under, I noticed with horror it must have been about three feet long.

I ran back the way we had come, grabbing a fire extinguisher from the wall.¬† I couldn‚Äôt tell you whether I would have sprayed it or bludgeoned it, but I needed to stop it.¬† If nothing else, I needed to know what it was.¬† I needed it desperately.

Flynn stood frozen in the hall as I kicked the exit doors open, stepping out into the parking lot in the downpour, searching puddles and currents of water under dim yellow street lights.¬† A deep puddle had formed around an overflowed storm drain a little ways out, and I saw the water rippling back and forth as if a fish were swimming in it.

That was the last I ever saw of it.¬† That storm drain led right back to the ocean; from whence it came.

After perhaps thirty seconds in the rain, I came back in, completely soaked and trailing water on the tile.¬† Flynn just stared at me.

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù¬† He said.

For some reason, I laughed.

‚ÄúNothing to apologize for, you did everything right.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat *was* that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have no idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs just something that came up out of the ocean and eats dead bodies?‚Äù

Taking the glove off to look at the wounds on my hand, I shook my head.

‚Äú‚ÄòGunshot wound‚Äô was supposed to be cause of death, remember?‚Äù

His eyes went wide behind the goggles, and I couldn‚Äôt help but remember the marks on the body where the man had clawed at his back.¬† I wondered what would have happened to me if that thing had gotten to a softer part of me, rather than reaching my hand first.

It took me a long time to accept that I would never know what it was.¬† I talked to a couple of very good marine biologists over the next few weeks, who had never heard of anything like it.¬† One of them took a bunch of samples from the first body, and found some DNA.¬† The best she could tell me was that it was from some organism distantly related to a polychaete worm, although no similar DNA had been documented.

One of her only insights was that the creature most likely washed up because of the storm, which was the worst we‚Äôve ever had.¬† That was little comfort to me, because these ‚Äòonce in a lifetime‚Äô storms are only getting more common.

I asked her how I could find out what it was, what the next steps were.¬† Her answer stuck with me.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know half of what lives in the ocean, not even close.¬† If it‚Äôs something we‚Äôve never seen before, I can‚Äôt tell you how to find it.¬† We‚Äôll probably never know what it was.¬† [I‚Äôm sorry](https://www.reddit.com/r/patrickmullensauthor/comments/1kern3o/patrick_mullens_written_work/).‚Äù

From the hidden layer of reality known as The Fold‚Ä¶","It happened in Sacramento, late one night during light rain fall. I‚Äôd stepped out for a cigarette. I remember the streetlight flickering above me like it was trying to stay awake. The air had that muggy, heaviness to it, and the sidewalk shone like Chapter 1.¬† ""The Man with the White Eyes""

obsidian glass.

I noticed the street light again, this time I heard a humming sound. It was faint and sounded like electric static. I could almost feel the electric current. As I looked at the light it looked like it got hit by a small bolt of lightning, then dropped to the ground. That‚Äôs when I saw him.

He was standing at the edge of the alley, half in shadow, half in the buzzing yellow spill of a streetlamp. He didn‚Äôt walk up. He didn‚Äôt move. He was just suddenly *there*‚Äîlike he'd blinked into existence.

¬†

I thought maybe he was homeless. Maybe high. His clothes didn‚Äôt quite fit‚Äîa black windbreaker zipped up too tight, jeans too short at the ankles. Shoes with no laces. He wasn‚Äôt wet from the rain, though. That struck me. I shrugged it off, I took my phone out of my pocket to check emails and scroll through YouTube. The whole time it felt eyes on me, like this invisible force of energy nudging me. I looked over to the strange guy staring at me.

Something told me to ignore him, but I also had this intense feeling to engage and that‚Äôs when curiosity got me. So, I waved and said,

‚ÄúHey man,‚Äù nodding casually. ‚ÄúCan I help you with something?‚Äù I felt it was a normal thing to say to someone that is just staring at you.

That‚Äôs when I noticed his eyes.

They were white‚Äîmilky, no iris. But inside each white dome was a single black dot. Tiny. Too tiny. They didn‚Äôt blink. They didn‚Äôt *move*. They just stared, dead-on, like he was looking *through* me.

Still, I kept my cool. Maybe he was blind. Maybe he was wearing contacts. Maybe this was all fine.

He didn‚Äôt answer. Just opened his mouth.

And kept it open.

No sound at first. Just a wide, gaping mouth with teeth too small and too many of them, like a shark‚Äôs baby teeth trying to organize themselves into a smile.

Then, in my head, I *heard* it.

Not with my ears. It was like the words were *inserted* into my thoughts, like someone whispering in a room next to my soul:

**""Are you ready to go?""**

I froze. The cigarette fell from my hand. My lungs felt cold, like I‚Äôd inhaled something sharp and wet. I didn‚Äôt answer. I just turned and walked fast, not running. But I could feel it. That... *thing* wasn‚Äôt moving, but its presence was following me like a stink on my clothes.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.

And I haven‚Äôt really slept since.

It‚Äôs been weeks. And now, wherever I go, any reflection, any crowd, any window, I see those eyes. Just for a second. In the background. Watching.

Sometimes I hear the question again, just before sleep hits:

**""Are you ready to go?""**

Chapter 2. Origin.

¬†

So what the hell is this entity supposed to be?

The Pale One is a **Reclaimer**, a corrupted **psychopomp**, and a **Chronophage**‚Äîa being from a hidden layer of reality known as **The Fold**. The Fold is a non-linear, extradimensional archive where all potential versions of reality are stored. It is where dead timelines go to die. It is where forgotten souls linger. It is where beings like *it* wait.

The Pale One was once a guide between life and death, a necessary force. But after eons in the Fold, exposed to discarded realities and collapsed timelines, it changed. It became curious. Hungry.

It began to slip out of the Fold‚Äînot to reclaim the dead, but to feed on the **living** who are closest to being erased: the lonely, the broken, the ones who linger at the edge of existence.

I was exposed to something‚Äîsomeone‚Äîdying near me. Maybe I didn‚Äôt know it. A passing car accident. A dying man in a neighboring apartment. The Fold opened slightly, and it slipped through.

But when I engaged it, I did something that‚Äôs almost never done: I acknowledged it. Most people ignore the Pale One. Most can‚Äôt see it clearly. But I spoke to it. That act marked me as anchored‚Äîas real.

And now, it follows me. Not because I‚Äôm dead‚Ä¶ but because I‚Äôm not‚Äîyet.

¬†

Chapter 3. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the Walls‚Äù

I‚Äôve never felt so uneasy and unsettling before. That face, his disturbing appearance.

Eyes: White, with pinprick black pupils. The pupils are windows into lost timelines.

Face: Unmoving. Its expression mimics what it believes humans look like‚Äîbut is subtly wrong.

Voice: It does not speak aloud. Its words are invasive thoughts‚Äîtelepathic projections etched into the subconscious.

Mouth: When it opens its mouth, it reveals not just teeth‚Äîbut static. Inside is a sound, a frequency, that induces vertigo, nausea, or memory loss.

¬†

**""I think it's inside the walls now.""**

That was the first thing I said out loud after the third night without sleep. My own voice startled me. It‚Äôs been a few months now dealing with a fucked up sleeping pattern.

I hadn‚Äôt told anyone about what happened in Sacramento‚Äînot the guy with the eyes, not the telepathic question, not the smell of wet dust and static that lingered in the air even after I left. I tried to forget. But that only made it worse.

It started small.

Things moved when I wasn‚Äôt looking. Not big things, nothing dramatic. Just... the toothpaste cap twisted on backwards. The hallway light left on when I *knew* I‚Äôd turned it off. A receipt from a store I‚Äôd never visited sitting on my kitchen counter, dated three years ago.

Then came the time slips.

A man on the street greeted me by name‚Äîcalled me ""Eli."" That‚Äôs not my name.

A voicemail appeared on my phone. Just breathing. Then static. Then my own voice asking, ‚Äú**Are you ready to go?**‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember recording it. I *never* recorded it.

And the dreams... they weren‚Äôt dreams anymore.

I‚Äôd wake up and the walls of my apartment would be bleeding light. Not red. Not white. A kind of pale *absence*. Like something was shining from a place where light doesn‚Äôt belong. I‚Äôd hear whispering in the pipes. Not words, just *intent*. A pulling sensation.

I tried salt. Incense. Cameras. They all shorted out. One photo I took of the hallway came back with someone in the background‚Äîjust barely visible.

A figure in a black jacket, face turned. White eyes. Tiny pupils. Like someone took a needle to a snow globe.

**I stopped using mirrors.**

They lagged behind my movements. In one, I was still brushing my teeth long after I‚Äôd finished. Sometimes, the reflection smiled when I didn‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore.

I found a notebook in my closet yesterday‚Äîone I don‚Äôt remember writing in. The handwriting is mine, but the ink is faded and the paper looks decades old. Inside it, a message repeated page after page:

**Don‚Äôt speak to it. Don‚Äôt answer. Don‚Äôt look back. Don‚Äôt forget who you are.**

And then, on the last page, something new, written just recently:

**It already knows.**

Tonight, I heard footsteps in my apartment. Not outside. **Inside**. But when I checked every room, nothing. Then I saw it.

Not the whole thing.

Just its **reflection**‚Äîin the TV screen, turned off. Standing behind me.

It didn‚Äôt move. But I swear... I think it was smiling now.

¬†

Chapter 4. Breaking Time.

¬†

¬†

**I stopped dreaming.**

But something‚Äîsomething else‚Äî*keeps dreaming through me.*

When I blink, sometimes it‚Äôs longer than it should be. I close my eyes for a second and when I open them, I‚Äôm somewhere else. In a room I don‚Äôt recognize. With walls that seem to breathe in slow, damp pulses. With *shapes* that don‚Äôt belong. With photographs on the wall‚Äîof people with no faces. Just smooth skin stretched where their features should be.

Then I blink again, and I‚Äôm back.

I started recording my time. Bought a dozen clocks, put them in every room. But sometimes they don‚Äôt match. I‚Äôll lose three minutes in the bathroom. Seventeen seconds walking from the kitchen to the hallway. Once, I stood at my front door and watched the second hand of my watch just *stop*. Then it ticked backwards. Three times.

**I think time‚Äôs beginning to break.**

Or maybe just *my* time.

I started noticing things. Patterns. The number **12** keeps showing up. Emails at 12:12 AM. License plates ending in 1212. A receipt where the total came to $12.12‚Äîon a bill I didn‚Äôt remember paying.

I think that‚Äôs when I saw it again. Not in the flesh. Not directly.

But in the **corner of my eye**, always just out of focus. Like it‚Äôs stitching itself into my **peripheral reality**. If I look too fast, I miss it. But if I don‚Äôt look at all, I feel it *grin*.

Then came **The Fold**.

It opened last night. I know how insane that sounds. But I wasn‚Äôt dreaming.

There was a crack in my bedroom wall. A literal, physical crack‚Äîlike the plaster had been split. But through it‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt see drywall. I didn‚Äôt see wood or wiring.

I saw **movement**.

Something was folding and unfolding, infinitely‚Äîlike geometry collapsing in on itself. Spirals made of shadows. The sound of breathing from a mouth too wide. And somewhere in that darkness, **those eyes**.

It asked me again‚Äîno voice, just pressure behind my eyes:

**‚ÄúAre you ready to go?‚Äù**

But this time‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt walk away.

I said:

‚ÄúWhat happens if I say yes?‚Äù

And I swear to God, the crack **grew**.

**Now I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs real.**

I walked outside this morning and none of the cars had license plates. I passed a man sitting on the curb with no shadow. The sun was in the sky, but the birds were flying backwards. I watched a woman walk into a coffee shop twice‚Äîsame dress, same steps, same cough.

The Pale One isn‚Äôt just following me anymore.

It‚Äôs **rewriting me**.

I'm currently using a Countryman E6XDW5T2SL and testing a signal chain that looks like this:



Mic ‚Üí personal laptop (ASIO4ALL + Cantabile + either RNNoise or Brusfri) ‚Üí Cubilux CB5 line-out ‚Üí Cubilux CB5 line-in ‚Üí work laptop (this is because I can't install any software on my work computer to run those noise-removal VST's)



My goal is to filter out coffee shop background noise \*before\* it reaches the work laptop, so that I can be on video calls in these envrionments without it coming through my microphone. Because of this, I'm looking for something that doesn't look super bulky/obtrusive on camera, and also filters background noise by being directional and by being close to my mouth.



Problem: The microphone has a TA4F connector on it, and I have a TA4F-to-TRRS adapter, which sounds great when plugged straight into the laptop's headset port; however, asio4all only shows the built-in headset port as an output, not an input. When I plug it into my Cubilux CB5 audio interface (which only accepts TRS), I‚Äôm forced to use a TRRS-to-TRS splitter ‚Äî and the mic sounds waaaaaaay too quiet that way. I suspect the splitter is the issue, not the interface, but I can't currently isolate the splitter nor the interface microphone port to do testing. I can say, however, that when I do line-out from one CB5 to line-in on the other CB5 and play music, it sounds totally fine. So...I can get a TA4F-to-TRS connector, but I'm hesitating because I might get to that point just to decide that this microphone isn't good enough at noise isolation anyways.



This one is directional, and it is pretty good, but it's still not quite as good as I was hoping for. I‚Äôve seen others like the Galaxy ESM8 unidirectional, and I‚Äôm wondering how much of a real-world improvement it (or others) might offer over the Countryman in this kind of noisy, portable use case. The unidirectional Galaxy ESM8 has a capsule on it, which seems like it should be better at noise isolation, and also makes it obvious whether or not I've got it pointed correctly.



Main question: 

‚Ä¢ How much of a difference would other microphones make over this Countryman?

‚Ä¢ What would you recommend for other microphones to use for this kind of use case?



Thanks in advance!

This simple yet groundbreaking revelation suddenly popped into my head within a minute or so before I parked my car coming home from work. 

In my past, in my unhealed state, I would take nearly every interaction with the object of my limerence and use anything and everything to justify being fixated on him while expecting a successful, intimate relationship from it. Some examples include: 

* the both of us laughing about how foolish the morning commuters were at not paying attention to the construction signs to mean that he really likes me, he's into me, and that he wants me
* him waving at me in the hallway while I'm walking in the door as he talks on the phone
* asking me questions about a salad I'd bring for lunch
* having his help with projects I'd be working on

I'd take such instances and actually believe that just because we'd be talking, joking around, having fun, and playing, it would mean that he REALLY liked me (the end of that party scene from *He's Just Not That Into You* comes to mind! Yes, the one where Ginnifer Goodwin's character throws herself at Justin Long). I'd dream about having looked into his eyes, noticing his laugh, enjoying the attention he had given me, and how gorgeous his voice sounded. I'd live inside of my head wondering if he was just as attracted to me as I was to him, if he liked me the same way I liked him, if he wanted me the same way I wanted him. In his presence, I'd be supremely giggly and flirty, trying very hard to hide the relationship I have with him in my mind while at the same time, believing that the imaginary relationship would somehow magically come true in real life (yes, even if we're debating if pineapple should be on pizza). 

Thankfully, I'm on the healing side and I'm busting my ass to make progress away from all that shit and getting much better. 

I will avoid the unnecessary hurt, disappointment, disillusionment, and the potential of being led on and (eventually) rejected if I starve to death a one-sided attraction. 

* friendly banter, playful conversation, and joking about general things are JUST THAT .. not romantic overtures or hidden declarations of love
* having his help with any project I work on is simply because he's wanting to be helpful ... and he's that way with everyone
* asking me questions about my food is no different than asking the next guy about the soda he got or the coffee that someone else decided to make that day
* him waving at me during his phone conversation was both welcoming me in that day while his focus and attention were elsewhere and to let me know why he wasn't at his desk or around 

Silence is the best weapon of choice because I'm not giving life to any unsubstantiated and non-existent feelings or relationship with the wrong man: 

* if there is no need for us to talk to each other, the high road is not saying anything
* if I feel like I have to engineer situations in order to get us to talk, that's protection from the universe to let me know I shouldn't be trying to talk to him
* avoiding talking stupid shit just to have an excuse to have his attention will save me the temptation of using looking into his eyes and replaying our conversations to daydream about him
* if I have to speak to him, I keep my words succinct and limited to the topic at hand
* following him around and yapping to get his attention may seem permissible because he'll be polite and empathetic to listen, but not necessarily beneficial. I'm better off staying put and keeping my mouth shut

As a result of implementing wise behaviors, I will avoid setting myself up for failure with the wrong man. When I don't give the wrong man an opportunity, he doesn't take it. He will naturally stay away from me. I won't be losing myself in dreaming about him because there's nothing there. And I'll also sidestep the humiliation of getting rejected (even repeatedly) because I believed the imaginary relationship I allowed to have about him in my mind would magically come true in real life. 

Starving a one-sided attraction will eventually kill it.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal white round coffee table combines aesthetics with functionality. Material quality, size, design, and storage solutions are all crucial aspects to consider.

**Material and Durability:** The quality of materials used in a white round coffee table directly influences its durability and longevity.Typically, these tables are constructed from MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard), solid wood, metal, or a combination thereof. MDF offers a budget-kind option, but solid wood provides superior stability and resistance to wear and tear. Metal frames often add a modern touch and can enhance structural integrity. A high-quality finish is essential to prevent scratches, stains, and yellowing over time. Consider options with powder-coated metal or multi-layered paint finishes for enhanced protection.

**Dimensions and Size:** Choosing the right size ensures that the coffee table complements, rather than overwhelms, your living space.Diameter and height are critical dimensions to consider. A table that is too large can make the room feel cramped, while one that is too small may not be practical. Generally, the coffee table should be approximately two-thirds the length of your sofa. the height should be roughly the same as the seat cushions of your sofa, or slightly lower, for easy access. Aim to leave about 12-18 inches between the coffee table and your sofa to allow ample legroom.

**Design and Style:** White round coffee tables come in a variety of designs to suit different tastes,from sleek minimalist styles to more elaborate,decorative pieces.

Consider the overall aesthetic of your living room when selecting a design. A simple, unadorned table works well in modern or minimalist spaces. For a more traditional look, consider a table with decorative legs or intricate detailing.The base design also contributes to the overall style; pedestal bases offer a contemporary feel, while four-legged designs provide a more classic appearance.**Storage and Functionality:** Some white round coffee tables offer additional storage to keep your living area neat and organized.

Options include built-in shelves,drawers,or lift-top mechanisms. Shelves are ideal for storing magazines, books, or decorative items, while drawers provide concealed storage for remote controls, coasters, and other small essentials.

Evaluate your storage needs and choose a table that provides the functionality you require.

1mu4jgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1mu4jgq/crush_at_first_sight/,Crush at first sight,"So, two years ago during the first week of my first year, I started crushing on this guy. He‚Äôs cool, he‚Äôs into some of the things I like (or at least pretends to be, idek). Back then, I low-key stalked him like a creep, didn‚Äôt make a move, and honestly wasn‚Äôt that serious about it.

In my second year, I thought: hey, let‚Äôs actually try being friends. And for context, I‚Äôm very straightforward by nature. So I asked him to be friends and tried to stay in touch but it wasn‚Äôt really reciprocated. He‚Äôd reply when I texted him but never reached out first. After about three or four months of that, I gave up and cut him off. He never reached out, neither did I.

Fast-forward to this June, we ended up working on something together. It was fine, but honestly, as likeable as he is, he‚Äôs also kinda insufferable with his bragging and boasting (which I suspect is just covering up insecurities). He mentioned owing me coffee twice but never actually brought it up again.

Then, at the end of July, he texted me again for work. I figured it was strictly work-related, but surprisingly he asked how I was, and the conversation went on from 4 pm until around 2 am. At one point, he even said ‚Äúanother coffee on me, friend.‚Äù So I thought, okay, maybe let‚Äôs actually hang out. I was nervous about messing it up, so I had a friend tag along. I even got him a small gift.

But after that day we hung out, he hasn‚Äôt initiated a single conversation.

Here‚Äôs the tricky part: there‚Äôs a third person in all of this. Last summer, he met a girl. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre just friends, but there‚Äôs obvious tension there. I stalked her and saw they‚Äôd been hanging out.

Honestly, if I remove the rose-colored glasses, he‚Äôs not my match intellectually. And I‚Äôm probably not his match either, especially because of the class difference. Still, it stings that after I put in the effort, he just ghosted me again. It‚Äôs not really his fault. I know I set my expectations too high but it hurts. 

He‚Äôs graduating next year, so I won‚Äôt see him much after this anyway. But right now, I‚Äôm just dreading the coming months of having to tolerate this situation while suffering in agony. 

I'm usually a very calculative person when it comes to romantic interests. Over the past two years, I‚Äôve tried talking to other people and making things work, but it just never clicked.

With this guy, though, it‚Äôs different and that‚Äôs the confusing part. Because honestly? He has some habits that really put me off. His nails were long and kind of dirty (I‚Äôm a total clean freak). He has crazy body hair, which I personally find disgusting. And his mouth‚Ä¶ well, it stank. I get that it could be because of his braces, but still, like‚Ä¶ he cant even spell and dont even get me started on the grammer or awful dialect?

Never in a million years did I think I‚Äôd fancy a guy like him. And yet, despite noticing all these things, despite my constant attempts to forget him and move on, I just keep falling for him even more.

‚ÄúLook at how far we have come, look at all we grew.‚Äù

yet when the day comes that our paths entwine,

Yesterday, there were still holidays in the city and the fair and attractions were relatively close (5 min walk). Someone came in with a kid and asked me to please put away their motorcycle helmets for about 2 hours. He offered me ‚Ç¨10 and I told him it wasn't necessary.

I always try to help others and it didn't seem right to me. Do I want to help him? Good. But not for the mere fact of receiving a tip (and a very high one at that). I told them to save that money to spend at the fair.

After a few hours, when I returned from putting away the tables and chairs that we have on the street, I found my two companions talking at the bar.

""So what do we do with this money? Should I leave it at the cash register?"" One of the two commented.

I saw a ‚Ç¨10 bill and looked where the helmets must have been and I understood what had happened.

The other colleague said no, that that money was from a tip, not from the collection. So I asked the first one and told him if he had really accepted that money from the owner of the helmets. He said yes and offered to divide it between the three of us, which the other person refused, because in any case I should keep that tip. I directly took it out of his hand and told him that I was keeping it, that I was the one who had agreed to keep those helmets.

I told him how bad it seemed to me that money had been accepted for something that was done as a favor.

In the end I kept it, but I felt terribly bad that he accepted that money, because it was not something that seemed right to me and much less that he had done. That is to say... if I see money on the ground and I don't pick it up, hoping that the rightful owner will pick it up, but you come from behind to keep it... not that.

That's what I'll keep it for.

I've thought about donating it. It's not a lot of money, but on the other hand, we're going through some tough financial times at home and that money would help us (everything counts), so I don't feel particularly bad in the end.

Furthermore, the second colleague (who always refused to accept it since he also understood the act as a selfless favor) later told me that when the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù left‚Ä¶ the colleague who took the money, the first thing he did was put it in his pocket and say ‚Äúwell, it's already gone‚Äù, but then he took it out saying that it was a joke, due to the complaints made by the other waiter, regarding such an‚Ä¶ ugly act.

What would you have done? Would you have saved the helmets for someone who was not going to consume in your business? My intention is always to be able to be kind and that's why I did it.

Would you have willingly accepted the tip?

I used to help ‚Äúkeep track‚Äù of things for him which took a ton of my mental energy and then upon realizing that this was actually enabling him to rely on me to find things for him all the time, I stopped doing this for him. 
This obviously causes a ton of stress as frequently he can not find something and goes into a loud tantrum, where he starts turning the place upside down, which I have to clean later. 
I‚Äôm the type of person who likes my things a certain way so we know that living together isn‚Äôt compatible. 

He has recently lost his probably 30th water bottle since we started dating, and I let him borrow one of my 2 water bottles (I really treasure them. I don‚Äôt really own nice things, but I like my 2 water bottles and have kept them in pristine condition for 2 years). He was really upset so I let him borrow it for one afternoon on Saturday. (He HAS lost my water bottles and coffee mugs in past) He did not lose it thankfully, but he has not cleaned it.

Today, he asked me to borrow it again and I just told him no. He seemed really annoyed by this, and I pointed out I had even bought him a different water bottle, which he says he doesn‚Äôt like as much???? 
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to want him to wash it and return it to me in a condition I‚Äôve lent it to him in, but since he is so forgetful etc it‚Äôs just exhausting to keep reminding him. I know it‚Äôs going to start smelling if I don‚Äôt wash it soon, but I am truly just so annoyed that he just brings it back dirty and thinks that‚Äôs the end of ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù. Like it feels like this man has 0 manners. 

This is just one thing that keeps happening due to how often he loses his waterbottle specifically, but he also does this with coffee mugs (2/2 of my mugs are damaged because of his borrowing, I‚Äôm just too tired to keep buying new ones so I just use them broken), headphones, bags, etc until everything just becomes worn out, broken, damaged and lost. 

AIO over just ‚Äústuff‚Äù? I know they‚Äôre just stuff but I hate buying stuff and get really attached to the few things that I like, he doesn‚Äôt really seem to get that and everything is just replaceable for him. ",2,1755565663.0,AmIOverreacting,7,1.0,False

p.s. The dealer's agent did not tell me about the exact APR number and asked me to sign.
