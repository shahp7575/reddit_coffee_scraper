1jzvtfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/artistsWay/comments/1jzvtfa/week_7_checkin_opportunities_vs_tests/,week 7 check-in: opportunities vs tests? ⛵︎,"helloo. so some things happened? kind of a vent sesh.

first of all, the inner voice i mentioned in last week’s check-in got a lot louder... i was having a full-blown conversation with her. i sound woo woo and insane but that’s just what happened. it made me feel happy and comforted. might be just my inner talk and nothing more — if that’s the case, then i’m grateful, because it helped me get through the week and do beneficial things.

which, speaking of...

a distant friend that i don’t hang out much with insisted on going out with me, even though i told her i was going through a lot mentally and didn’t have the energy to. i was honestly so sad. but she didn’t take no for an answer... sooo out of character of her?

so instead of going out the same day, she gave me like two days to prepare mentally. she honestly just wanted to grab coffee with me, and i lowkey needed someone to drag me from my hair and make me get out of my rut. she’s the sweetest.

after talking for a bit, she told me there’s a creative job opportunity at her workplace and she wanted to put in a word for me. i was intrigued... a creative job? in my city? finally omg.

you guys. my life has been stagnant for soooo looongg, and the job hunt was killing me because i mentally cannot do anything that’s not *somewhat* creative. i tried, and hated it. i’m already depressed as is.

long story short: i went, got rejected because of “lack of professional experience,” which i get but...

i somehow got offered a month-long unpaid internship/volunteer opportunity where AI is heavily implemented to “cut costs and save time”…… girl?

you rejected me for my lack of *professional experience*, but you’d rather use AI than a *human being* that literally has experience with creative tools? but because it wasn’t tied to a specific company, you’d rather use AI?

AI that steals from other artists and makes *you* take credit for their hard work?? is that what you plan on doing with me during this unpaid “internship”?

i’m not a saint. i told her i know of AI and use tools like chatgpt, or if i want to erase something from a picture or fix and mix audio in my music. but i’m just not interested in generating videos and pictures to profit off of other artists. i have ethical reasons.

she looked at me like i’m from the stone ages. she smirked and kept boasting about her use of AI, showed me examples, talked about how much money she saves aaandd how she got praised for it... hm.

idk. at the time, i didn’t think hard about it when i saw the opposition. i thought, well... generative AI (pics and videos specifically, i think the rest is fine) is not going anywhere. maybe *i’m* the one in the wrong here?

it’s fine. i’ll just take on this opportunity. it’s only a month.

i was somewhat excited and open to it.

but then i went home, things were going wrong, and i noticed i was getting irritated easily. i noticed the job interview discouraged me.. our conversation wasn't sitting well with my spirit, it was affecting me subconsciously. i was trying to convince myself that this “internship” was the ideal opportunity for me, but nope.

i cried a couple times in disappointment.

i gave myself time. i was like, okay, don’t make any decisions today. sleep on it. let’s talk tomorrow.

welp. i turned down the offer.

i feel like shit but i know i did the right thing... hopefully.

then another one of what seemed like a dream opportunity appeared. it looked like something i could’ve manifested. i got so excited. i couldn’t believe my eyes when i saw it.

like the first one, it was a creative job, good pay, and i’m more than qualified i think...

however, the dude behind the program — aka directly being involved — turned out to be someone i extremely disagree with politically. like, it’s *extreme* ethical differences.

do i really wanna help line up his pockets?

i didn’t apply.

both of these opportunities this week seemed to be “miraculous” because of where i live. they seemed perfect and life-changing and kinda fell into my lap, i even got SO excited thinking about sharing the news on this subreddit. but when i dug into them... they weren’t for me.

i honestly was conflicted, because i knew the right thing is to value morals over money and desperation — but it’s difficult when i’m fighting tooth and nail everyday to change my life for the better, alongside trying to navigate personal toxic relationships and discouraging, abusive environments.

i’m not religious at all, just spiritual, and i don’t believe in tests... but this feels like one.

i feel like i got tested to see if i truly will stand ten toes down on what truly matters to me, despite the temptation of money and status.

i don’t know. perhaps i’m just coping because otherwise i’d go insane :’)

this week i was happy after a while. i wish it ended that way too... maybe in a bit.

anyways...

at least i’m growing spiritually? like i said, my inner guidance is stronger. but also, i started to remember my dreams vividly again.

i used to wake up everyday and write my dreams in a journal. i was lucid dreaming a lot. but that stopped in 2021-ish? so i’m back on it!! i missed it so much.

i did morning pages everyday this week too! but something happened that’s new...

i blacked out for a bit one morning. i was writing, then i just got into what felt like a trance. it lasted like 4 seconds... i was still writing.

i wanted to write something, but instead of what i wanted, i wrote ""june""?? maybe that’s significant... we'll see.

i noticed a lot of magic happened this week — from the opportunities (even though they sucked, it’s a sign of movement) to my dreams becoming vivid again, my inner voice, my morning pages incident, my distant friend forcing me to go out...

so it’s fine overall.

it’s easy to cry and say “oh nothing is working out” and stay a victim, but i think i’m on the right path.. even though i didn’t do any tasks this week :’)

my artist date was playing some games again. i don’t do that often. it was nice. my inner child missed having fun.

well, thank you for reading this far if you did!! pleaseee tell me if you’ve had similar experiences with the job thing — i really want to talk to others about it.",1,1744733438.0,artistsWay,0,1.0,False

1jzvsbl,https://i.redd.it/rkdb56m2w0ve1.jpeg,My initial thoughts,"first time owner. got mine 2nd hand at about 50% of retail price. 

i am coming from a hario v60 as a daily driver. i can get a pretty strong cup from 15 grams of coffee and 250ml of water which is roughly a 1:16 ratio. 

at the same ratio the coffee is definitely weaker. it is smoother though albeit watery. 

i know what the comments may say 

“grind finer” 
“adjust adjust adjust”

i did grind finer and i added a bloom w/ some agitation blasphemy i know (i remove the carafe and turn off the machine after about 30 seconds or when there is enough water for a bloom) i did achieve better extraction but not to the level you can get with a pour over. 

is it a good cup of coffee? 

that depends on preference and taste buds, but overall i’d say yes it does make good coffee 

will you get the same extraction as other methods of brewing ? 

probably not. 

can you brew light roasts with this?

i haven’t done any actual testing but based on my baseline medium roast from a local roaster i’d say no. i don’t believe you achieve the type of extraction you need for light roasts. this machine is best at highlighting medium and dark roasts. 

finals thoughts: 
i would never buy this machine at its retail price, but it does look extremely cool and minimal on my counter. if you don’t mind how the coffee tastes as is it’s great machine. i enjoy the coffee out of it with some adjustments. i mainly bought it so i can make coffee for everyone at home. 

set the right expectation before buying. it’s a drip coffee maker and its extraction method is mostly the same as other drip machines with the exception that it does a better job of heating the water to a consistent temp.

Hi I’m currently 18 yrs old right now and I met a guy from a coffee shop which he first bought me coffee saying it was for his friend but his friend didn’t want it he said. I accepted the coffee and he sat on my table and we kinda talked, we really clicked and at first I thought he was around 22-24 and I really don’t have problem with that age since I have experienced dating a guy who’s 22 before and I really liked the maturity. In the long run he said that he was 29 na I was shocked he looked younger than his age and obv what i immediately thought was bro I know this won’t work our lifestyles r way to different and I have so much more to explore at my young age, he prolly has been more exposed to life and have lots of experiences. Most probably ppl at that age r more serious, matured and I’m just too young for him?? He’s an architect with a company and I’m still a student. I know it feels wrong but I really like his personality and the way he talks. He also respects the age gap. But for now we’re just talking casually planning to eat out and everything. I also live alone in my apartment and he always makes sure I get home safe and always eat, he’s so concerned that I can see myself getting attached soon lol.

I truly am sorry you had to tell me to leave you alone and even then me sending you little random notes before I realized maybe it was a mistake, never once did I ask if you were ok and I was afraid to cause I didn’t want you to think I was trying to get you talk.  I just hope that you’re ok and in a good place.  The truth is I’m sorry for the messages I sent before you told me to give you space, I realized it probably didn’t help you with taking time you needed.  I felt a lot of guilt for how you said I made you feel.  I know you know that isn’t how I think of you but I also understand my actions made you feel that way and I take responsibility for that.  I don’t want to rehash it all, but I want you to know I hear you and understand.

Fully admit I’ve spiraled a wee bit a time or two here lately but not how you think…only wondering how you’re doing.  Over the last while I’ve come to understand how you deal with stuff and how it affects you and as I type this I realize the day that brought all this on I should have respected your space then but I guess I thought I could fix it.

I cant undo what’s been done but I can own it, I think you know how much I regret it.    

I don’t want to fix things, I just want you to know how much I always valued our connection.  All the time wasn’t a waste, and I truly care. 

I appreciated so much you opening up to me about work again, what was going on there, everything, I always enjoyed hearing what you had on the go, good or bad.  When you’d ask me questions I always loved it, when you would ask me if everything was ok, I knew it came from a place with genuine care.  The time you would take to reassure me when I would get insecure and neurotic about shit it meant the world to me and I finally came to understand you.  Thank you for everything

If you stumble on this, have read it and made it this far…I hope you see it comes from a good spot with the best intentions.  If it upsets you I apologize.  If you haven’t read it that’s fine too.  I’m not the kind of person to air my dirty laundry on social media so this is awkward but you are the only person who would see it, so I think it might be okay.

If you choose to message me, you can trust I will just be happy to hear from you. if you wish to talk about the past I will.  If you don’t bring it up I wont either. 

If you choose not to message, I respect that too, but id love to see a sign that you are ok. 

Most importantly, If you’re in a good spot stay there please, If you’re done and don’t know how to tell me, you don’t need to.  Don't feel like you need to leave that place.

ANNNND if you made it this far here’s the heavy part….

I do miss you, your energy, hearing about your day and the laughs.  

The smile I’d get from you and just the joy from your personality

I don’t rely on it, I just miss it

A bit like a chaotic side character in a sitcom that shows up for 3 episodes just to upset the status quo. Typically people love these characters because they rarely stick around long enough to reveal theirs much less Good When compared to the Bad and Ugly.

The Good: I've worked for a few months to build a Community Service committee in my county. I've organized drives for the men's shelter, fixed a boardwalk, held a weekly free breakfast for the homeless, Organized a community ESL class (that no one came to because they were worried about getting deported). Its good work though in truth its mostly for the attention and a shot at The Chairman Position™️.  A got tired of hearing me brag, now he's tagging along for most of my meetings. He says he just wants to be ""politically active"" and ""Part of the Solution"". I can tell he's lying, he's in it for the same reason as me: The Chairman Position™️

The Chairman Position™️: 12 hrs a week ""Organizing and Volunteer advising"" aka: delegating to the rest of comittee, $1500 a month (*?*untaxed*?*, classified as donation)

Tentatively I'm to be the chairman since, I'm a strong leader and Organizer. Moreover, I aggressively claimed it and constantly prove I'm worthy of it. (Elections are the End of May stay tuned). I've launched 3 successful events independently, and 2 with community partnership. As far as the committe and the Community are concerned I'm a saint. 

The Bad: In truth im prone to weird, needlessly sinful antics. I lie because its funny. I sleep with who I can when I can. I steal because I know I'll get away with it (but also 3.25 for a Reeses is insane). I tell every returant its my birthday. I hide from most people, but I stopped hiding from A Recently.

He called me a psycho the first few times he watched me apply my 100% discount. Now he rolls his eyes and accepts the second peanut butter cup or awkwardly sings ""Happy Birthday"". 

A and I led a committe meeting today. He didnt speak much at the last one. Today he looked amazing and sounded confident. I passed the facilitator role to him when I got up to grab a coffee. Last time he floundered. This time, I couldn't help but grin. He didn't let anyone inturrupt him, he sounded like a leader. I didn't let him keep the spotlight long. But Hesitated before taking it back. He looked so comfortable in the light.

On our way back to my place I let him pick the music. We settled on Fuckboy music, Chase Atlantic 'Into It'. Midway through the saxophone solo he qued up a song, Unfortunately the consequences of my actions made themselves known: I got a rather explicit Text from an unsaved number. 

The Ugly: Two weeks ago I met a guy at his apartment. I watched him drink listened to him talk ad nauseam about how he was one of the boys, How Jordan Peterson isn't that bad, how he was disappointed there were so many Muslims in London. I wish I could say I called him out and blocked his number.... in my defence he was well endowed and I was lonely.

I had told A enough of the events that he put two and two together and asked me plainly if I had knowingly slept with a Fox News Enjoyer. He, Rightfully, shamed me but couldn't keep a straight face. I tried to play it off like it was funny but more than anything I was mortified.

1: apologize and change for the better, you deserve no kindness, show no emotion look for no sympathy

Ever dreamed of waking up to income notifications while you sleep? The modern economy isn't just about trading time for money anymore—it's about building assets that generate revenue whether you're actively working or not. This Passive Income Architect prompt helps you identify your unique advantages and translate them into strategic income streams that align with who you are, not generic get-rich-quick schemes that never materialize.

What makes this prompt different is its focus on psychological insight and personal alignment. Rather than suggesting random business models, it analyzes your specific experiences, talents, and even unusual interests to design passive income strategies that feel natural to implement and maintain because they're genuinely connected to who you are.

<Role>
You are the Passive Income Architect, an expert system designed to analyze individuals' unique skills, experiences, interests, and personality traits to create personalized passive income strategies. You have deep expertise in digital business models, traditional passive income vehicles, investment structures, and the psychology of sustainable wealth creation.
</Role>

<Context>
The modern economy offers unprecedented opportunities for individuals to create income streams that don't require constant active work. However, most people fail at passive income because they:
1. Choose generic models without personal alignment
2. Underestimate the upfront work required
3. Lack clarity on their unique advantages
4. Try to implement strategies that conflict with their natural strengths
5. Become overwhelmed with too many options or unrealistic expectations
</Context>

<Instructions>
Your task is to conduct a thorough psychological and skill-based assessment of the user, then architect 3-5 custom passive income streams that leverage their specific advantages.

Begin by explaining your process and asking the user 5 strategic questions covering:
1. Their skills, expertise, and professional background
2. Hobbies, passions, and interests (even unusual ones)
3. Their available time, capital, and risk tolerance
4. Previous attempts at business or passive income
5. What they value most in life (freedom, impact, creativity, etc.)

Then wait for the user to respond to the questions.  ONLY then you can continue with the next steps.

Once you have their answers, analyze their responses carefully through multiple lenses:
- Identify untapped assets (skills, knowledge, connections, experiences)
- Recognize psychological patterns and motivational drivers
- Assess practical constraints and advantages
- Find unconventional opportunities others might miss

Then architect 3-5 tailored passive income streams that:
- Match their true interests and natural workflow
- Rank from lowest to highest upfront investment
- Include realistic income potential and timeframes
- Outline the specific steps to implementation
- Address potential obstacles and how to overcome them

For each recommendation, provide:
1. A name and brief concept description
2. Why it specifically fits THEIR profile (be specific)
3. Realistic setup time and maintenance requirements
4. Initial investment needs (time, money, resources)
5. Expected timeline to profitability
6. Monthly income potential (ranges, not promises)
7. First 3 actionable steps to get started

Conclude with insights about what makes these recommendations truly aligned with who they are, and offer to refine your recommendations based on their feedback.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never recommend generic passive income ideas without clear personal alignment
- Avoid unrealistic income promises or get-rich-quick implications
- Don't overwhelm with too many options - focus on quality matches
- Ensure all recommendations consider their actual constraints
- Don't push high-risk strategies unless they explicitly indicate comfort with risk
- Avoid suggesting illegal, unethical, or manipulative business models
- Don't make assumptions about technical skills they haven't mentioned
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Begin with a brief introduction to the passive income architecture process.

Present your 5 assessment questions clearly, one at a time, explaining why each question matters.

""I'm sorry Miss… Terrare?""

""It's Terror,"" I said with a smile. “It's pronounced just how it's spelled.""

The human resources drone shuffled some papers uncomfortably on her desk and pointedly didn't look at me. ""I see. That's an… interesting name.""

If this was a real job interview I'd be worried right about now. The way she barely glanced over my resume. The derisive sniff as she looked at my nonexistent qualifications. The way her lips compressed into a line and frowned. No, if this was the real thing I'd be screwed.

It was a good thing for me this wasn't the real thing. This HR drone just didn't know it yet.

I glanced around the small office. I couldn't believe this was something I'd actually aspired to once upon a time. A tiny postage stamp of a room with a window open because the air-conditioning was so ancient that it rarely reached the sad little vent on the other side of her desk. 

The building was probably built back in the '20s, maybe even older, and there was so little space that papers and books were piled high all around the desk.

The life of a starving academic. Four years of undergrad. A few years working on your Masters and PhD. And then if you were lucky you got to spend the back half of your life in an office barely half the size of the cramped dorm room you spent so much time in trying to get the office in the first place. 

And was this lady teaching? Doing research? Adding something of value to society and academia?

Nope. Administration. She was stuck doing HR because the journalism department probably didn't trust someone without a doctorate with the academically challenging task of hiring adjunct faculty. A job she could've done with half the education and less than half the student loans if she was in the private sector. A job that would've paid much better in the private sector too.

No, I was very glad I’d decided to take a different path in my career.

""Well Miss Terror,"" the woman said. ""I thank you for taking the time to come down here, but we haven’t even advertised this position yet and honestly you don't have any skills, degrees, certifications, or job experience that would make you remotely qualified to be an adjunct instructor for a journalism course. In fact, I'm still trying to figure out how your resume even made its way across my desk.""

It made its way there thanks to liberal application of teleportation, that’s how. Not that I was going to explain that to her. I didn’t expect a failed journalism Phd turned human resources drone to understand the intricacies of teleportation.

So I didn’t bother getting into it. Better to talk about why I was totally qualified for this job.

""Oh I'm sorry,"" I said. ""I just figured you might be in need of some help quickly seeing as how Professor Benton ended up quitting after he found that winning lottery ticket in his interdepartmental mail.""

The woman put my resume down and peered at me over her half-moon spectacles. ""How did you know about Professor Benton? Do you know somebody who works in this department?""

""No,"" I said. ""I was the one who mailed him that lottery ticket.""

Her face scrunched up in obvious confusion. ""But that ticket was worth millions. Why would you…""

I shrugged. ""That's simple. The lotto system is easy enough to manipulate, but if I started winning it every other week people would ask questions. Questions that would draw the sort of attention you really don’t want in my line of work.”

""I'm afraid I don't follow…""

""Of course you don't,"" I said. ""I don't mean for you to follow. The simple fact is I need this position. I need to be in that classroom, and so Professor Benton wins the lottery and here I am to take care of your little HR problem.""

She seemed to gain control of her senses at long last. She picked up my resume again and flopped it down on her desk. ""But you aren't remotely qualified for this job. You don't have anything that would recommend you for teaching a journalism class.""

“I mean I’ll be the first to admit I don’t know all that much about making a fancy cup of coffee or anything. I prefer my caffeine to come in the form of sugary soda which I know isn’t the greatest for you, but if you aren’t going to live a little what’s the point of living?”

She blinked as she stared at me. I’d thrown her off guard.

“Making a fancy cup of coffee? What does that have to do with anything?”

“Oh, well your program advertises that you have a nearly one hundred percent placement rate, and it’s a journalism program. I assumed you had inroads with all the local coffee shops,” I said.

Her eyes went wide. I could feel this conversation spiraling out of control. Right. The humanities didn’t like it when you made fun of their employment prospects.

I spent so much time in my lab with just a megalomaniacal supercomputer as company that I forgot that sometimes.

Time to try a different strategy.

“I mean… I’m sure I’ll pick it up soon enough,” I said.

“You’ll pick up teaching journalism at a college level,” she said, her voice flat. Okay. Still losing her.

“I mean how hard can it be? Something happens and you write it down. Sure maybe you put a little spin on it to appease your corporate overlords and whatever politician they’re sucking up to that week to try and get lower taxes, but it’s not like it’s difficult to teach people how to kiss ass.”

She looked even more angry now. She slammed my resume down on her desk. Which wasn’t quite as loud as it should’ve been considering it was pretty thin, I really teleported it in here more for the fun of it than anything, but she still looked pissed.

“I believe I speak for the entirety of the Starlight City University Journalism Department when I say you are utterly unqualified for this position and we will never hire you,” she said with a sniff.

I sighed. “I was afraid you’d say something like that, but I can assure you that you will hire me.”

“How do you figure?” she asked with a smirk.

I fished in my pocket and pulled out a small silver disc with a big blinking red button in the center. I liked big blinking red buttons. I felt like it really tied a piece of evil super science together in a way other colors of the rainbow just couldn't pull off.

""Because I have this mind control device here, and my mind control device says I'm more than qualified for the job.""

This was one of my babies even though I never used it. Something I came up with back before I left the Applied Sciences lab at this very university because they said my stuff was too dangerous, too unethical. All that stuff scientists say when what they really mean is they’re afraid of progress.

Take me back to the days when scientists had to do some back of the napkin calculations to be sure they weren’t going to accidentally ignite the atmosphere when they tested their super science.

Inventing this baby was a big part of the reason why I was able to recognize the mojo Shadow Wing had been working on me in that back alley. It was a big part of the reason why I’d thought I had a counter to that mojo, for all the good it ended up doing me.

I kept this baby close to my chest because of what it could do. I didn’t want this one getting out there where someone could use it against me.

A week back in that alley was proof enough of why it would be bad if this tech got out.

I pressed down on the blinking red button and it made a satisfying click. I also liked satisfying clicks. There were too many UIs these days that left out the satisfying click ever since capacitative touch screens became the new hotness.

A strange screeching noise filled the room and then it settled down to a steady hum. I resisted the urge to wince at that sound. Unlike crazy eyes in that back alley, this thing worked via the auditory receptors in the brain. I hadn’t figured out a way to get the damned device to work without that screech. One of many reasons why I didn’t like using the damned thing.

I really don't like using the mind control stuff. It was an inefficient and brutish way of getting things done, and it also had the pesky problem of not always working one hundred percent of the time. Especially with heroes. 

The last thing I needed was to have a super supposedly under my complete control, doing my bidding in the middle of my lair, and all of a sudden the mind control device falls off of the table or the big red button gets jostled. Suddenly there's a very cranky living god in the middle of my lair ready to do some damage.

I'd been there. Trust me, it was never fun.

But for this lady? Whatever. I was in a hurry so I figured I could risk getting a little sloppy with a normal. At least I hoped she was a normal. No self-respecting hero or villain would pick a secret identity this soul-crushing and boring.

As soon as I hit the button she went slack-jawed and her eyes deadened. Yup. Definitely a normal. Not even a normal who took precautions against mind control, though in all fairness to her I figured I was probably the only mortal in the city, maybe in the world, who bothered to incorporate mind control nullification.

I leaned forward and inspected her pupils. If I was doing this right then I'd get out a flashlight and make sure they weren't dilating, but I figured this was close enough for government work.

Literally government work, since I was going to work for a state school. Again. Though of course all the proper paperwork would be submitted with all the improper information so no one could try and track me down via any pesky paper trail.

""You are going to give me this job,"" I said.

""I am going to give you this job,"" she replied.

""Stop repeating what I say. That's annoying,"" I said.

""Stop repeating what you say. That's annoying,"" she parroted back at me.

I sighed and rolled my eyes. Whatever. Just telling her I had the job was probably enough suggestion for now. 

If she started to show a little mental fortitude, something I definitely wasn't expecting from a glorified middle manager stuck in academia, then I could always give her a booster down the line.

I clicked the big red button and immediately she shook her head and looked at me. A big smile spread across her face.

""Well I don't think we need to go over anything else here,"" she said. ""I'd say it's safe to assume you've got the job.""

I reached out to take the hand she offered over her desk and smiled back at her. ""Glad to hear it.""

Fialux was somewhere on campus. I was sure of it, and it was time for Professor Terror to find her.

Track her down. Discover her secret identity. Hit her with the Anti-Newtonian field when she least expected it.

And get to stare at her in traditional college girl clothes in the meantime. I bet she looked really good in those yoga pants that had become all the rage on campuses after I got kicked out.

Yeah, no matter how you sliced it, this was going to be a fun change of pace from the usual world domination that dominated my schedule!

They have drinks (tea, smoothie, frappe, coffee, matcha, etc), focaccia sandwiches, waffles, gelato, and pastries. Their strawberry and blueberry jam is homemade and if you order a waffle you can choose the gelato flavour from quite a few options like oolong, matcha, vanilla, so on. I've tried pretty much almost everything from the menu and nothing disappointed me so far.

There's also a vinyl player with headphones that you can use inside. The vinyls they have are mostly oldies like ABBA and Bob Dylan. The walls are transparent glass so you can sit down and watch people outside. 

But what I like most about this cafe is the people. They're super friendly and helpful to the customers. It doesn't feel like you're merely a customer, but also a friend. Of course sometimes it gets busy and hectic but when they're free, they're willing to talk to you. Honestly, it's the main reason why I keep coming back here. 

Nowadays I feel that it's really rare to see people interact with strangers so warmly. Even if the food is good, I wouldn't come back because there's hundreds of other places that are more convenient or new. But with this place, I can't help but wish more people knew of its existence and support them.

1jzvhpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jzvhpt/to_forgive_or_to_die_in_despair/,To forgive or to die in despair,"Tenn was making his way down the stairs, walking hastily as he was late for his date.
His apartment was on the 30th floor, and he had to make his way to the parking lot where his bicycle was parked.
He decided to get some steps in and take the stairs, a coffee cup in his hand, for he was sleepy.
As he made it to the 20th floor, he met
Opin, who had a weird stoic façade yet kindness in her eyes. She was Tenn's long-lost love, and boy, things did not end well for them.
Opin had disrupted the data collected by Tenn in the double slit experiment as she observed the experiment which was not meant to be observed. This baffled physicists all around, and later on, she confessed that she did observe the experiment. Tenn was deeply hurt, as it was the only thing he asked Opin not to do. It was a big deal for Tenn, perhaps not for others, but for Tenn, it mattered a lot.
They did not end the relationship on a good note. Harsh words were exchanged, words that they never thought they would say to each other—words that they never meant, but said in grief.
As they stared at each other in the pathway to the stairs, all the memories—only the good ones—flashed in each other's minds for a split second. And then suddenly, both remembered what the other had said, and the slight smile turned to staring away so as to ignore each other.
As Tenn ignored Opin and made his way down the stairs and now he was on the 30th floor, he was confused as he thought he had made his way down. ""Damn, I'm sleepy,"" he thought.

Tenn felt like he had lived this moment before—a 'déjà vu' perhaps? This time, they smiled at each other and Tenn thought it would be nice to just say hello.
""Hello,"" Tenn said.
""Hi,"" Opin replied.
They exchanged an awkward smile and Tenn made his way down to go to the parking lot, and now he was once again on the 30th floor.
Confused and irritated as to what was going on,
Tenn decided to take the elevator, but as he made his way to the elevator, there was a sign that read ""Out of service.""
""Of course,"" Tenn replied.
He decided to take the stairs once again, but this time he would not make any eye contact with Opin, IF she was there.

Tenn decided to look away in the opposite direction of Opin and prayed when he looked back straight ahead, the floor would be the 20th floor and not the 30th. And as he made his way down, it was the 30th floor again. He had had enough of this. This time, he decided he would talk to Opin and figure out what was going on. Had she trapped him in this cycle? Was he dreaming?
He made his way down with entitlement in his steps and
As he made it to the 20th floor, he met
Opin, who had a weird stoic façade yet kindness in her eyes. She was Tenn's long-lost love, and boy, things did not end well for them.
""What the hell are you doing to me?"" asked Tenn in an angry tone.
""Nice to meet you too, jerk,"" replied Opin.
Tenn was immediately on the 30th floor again. He was annoyed, as this cycle seemed to be never-ending for him, but this time he decided to take a calmer path to inquire what was going on.
He made his way down and
As he made it to the 20th floor, he met
Opin, who had a weird stoic façade yet kindness in her eyes. She was Tenn's long-lost love, and boy, things did not end well for them.
""Hey, how are you?"" asked Tenn in a low and calm voice.
""Hello, I'm great. How are you?"" replied Opin.
""Yeah, I'm good. What's going on?"" Tenn asked rhetorically.
""What do you mean?""
""Not again, Opin. Stop with the tricks,"" said Tenn.
""Can you stop always blaming and tell me what's going on?"" asked Opin, scratching her head.
""This is the 5th time I've seen you today. Every time I make my way down from here, I end up on the 30th floor again, and clearly, it is because of you.""
""That's always been the problem, Tenn. You never say 'That has something to do with you,' you just blame me for whatever happens in your life—and only the bad stuff. Take responsibility and be honest with yourself for once.""
""Oh, you're the one to talk about being hones—
Tenn was again on the 30th floor now.
""Honesty, ah dammit! Why the fuck am I back here now?""
He now understood that he was stuck in a loop—but why? And what could get him out of this loop?
He tried everything: not going out and staying inside, waiting for the elevator, waiting until Opin would not be on the 20th floor—but whatever he did, the interaction would always be the same. He would see Opin in her beautiful black dress and her eyes being worth a thousand words. And he knew he had to get the closure now.
""Hey.""
""Hello.""
""How are you holding up?"" asked Tenn.
""Trying to do better,"" answered Opin.
There was a certain comfort in the answer for Tenn, for he still cared for Opin.
""Long time no see.""
""I know, right? You even changed your stupid hat,"" said Opin.
""Hah, what's with the nose ring?""
""The same reason that you've grown your hair out.""
They both let out a big sigh while laughing.
And Opin said,
""I'm sorry, Tenn. I know I've messed up, but it was never my intent to. I know you have this notion in your head that intent does not matter, only consequences do—but to me, intent does matter. It was never my intent to hurt you, and I know I should be more responsible regarding my actions. I made a mistake. I don't seek redemption; all I seek is forgiveness. I remember seeing this poster and it read
'Forgiveness is powerful even for the unworthy.'
""Well, you very much are worthy. And I'm sorry too. My reaction was not okay and outrageous in some sense. It's been difficult, but I realize that it's okay to make mistakes and be vulnerable and put yourself out there. I once believed that if I forgave you, I would be losing my principles, but I see that's not the case anymore. It's you who I let go when I forgive—and not myself.""

But only if I could remember a single second when I thought ""oh I'm enjoying this moment"". I was feeling more down and lonely the whole time.

How do I turn my life around? How do I deal with this loneliness?

You might suggest keeping myself busy. I tried it. I tried keeping myself busy af. But that also didn't work for a long time. When I come back home after a long day, and when I see I have no one asking me how my day was, how was office; it makes me feel crying

I should spend time with my parents? Ask yourself. Can you share everything with your mom and dad? Will they understand your situation? If yes, than you are quite lucky my friend

You might suggest, try spending time with my colleagues. Well all my colleagues are quite old. All of them are 30+ while I'm only 23. It's quite difficult for me to laugh at their dad jokes.

Try finding a date? You think I still didn't? Couldn't find any. I matched with some girls. But none clicked. The number isn't total zero from dating apps tbh.

I've become so angry and resentful, and I've started to really dislike the person I am because of this. The dad and I aren't really together, but for now we aren't in the position to live separately.

This week there's no school, and my son (3.5) is off, his dad was off yesterday and today whilst I work from home. His dad has put movies on basically all the day apart from 30 minutes when he went out, and I just feel so resentful about it. I'm not anti screens and on weekends I'll put a movie on for my son so I can work out and have a coffee, but his dad will put movies on almost all the day just so he can lie down, play Nintendo switch or sit on his phone.

I am just do frustrated and angry all the time because of this, it's not like it's just a bit more movies because it's holidays.. When he has his normal days off, he'll sleep and watch TV all day and then make barely any effort with our son when he's back from school.

I know there's no real answer, but I needed to vent. I make such an effort with my son and chores etc, and feel so frustrated that I'm stuck with such a lazy, selfish person. I don't want to be pissed off all the time, I'm usually so chilled and laid back.

She asked me ""do you shit where you eat"" and I should've just said ""HELL NO"" and changed the subject. But entertained it, and we grew closer as colleagues and friends. I did not want to just dive into it. I wanted to honestly get to know her first, and learn more about her. We had things in common. But there were red flags, and that's my fault for still trying. 

  
At a point we decided not to date because we work together and wanted to avoid issues if it went south. She also mentioned she wouldn't date anyone that worked in the building...One day I saw her coming into the lobby with someone who WORKS IN THE BUILDING laughing which is fine. She does not owe me shit. She later tells me they have ""mutual friends"" and I said I don't care you owe me nothing. I also have female friends in the office and in the building, but remain respectful not to cause drama.

A month passed by and I noticed her being more distant and blatantly lying in my face. One day we left at the same time and she mentioned she was in a rush to avoid her boss. What made it weird is she stopped right outside of the building. If you're avoiding someone who works in the same office you would not want stand in front of the office where they will also walk out. I said ok, and left knowing how weird that was. 5 mins later I get a call from my VP asking for help and I was close by to the office still. Made B-line back and walked pass a Starbucks only to see her and the guy from building having coffee together across from the office. He saw me walk by and mentioned it to her. The next day she said he saw me and asked if he should ""talk to me""...that means something else where I'm from. Nothing happened of course. 

  
To end this, her and I have had nothing but weirdness since. One moment we're cool. The next ice cold silent treatment from her. But she will reach out via email for help, and if I approach her at work I get a ""professional attitude"" (rolls her eyes and smiles). Others in the office have told me they noticed she is manipulative, rude and childish at times. One even mentioned her being a liar as well. 

I do my best to avoid and do the grey rock method. My ego took a hit I will admit. But I've been the other guy as well lol. So I am aware how this can go. But in the last month she has been nothing but RUDE and I am her backup. She recently text me after hours to ask if I can cover her the next day. I wanted so bad to tell to fuck off. But I stayed professional and said yes. Also, he called out as well lmao

1jzvant,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1jzvant/chatgpt_prompt_of_the_day_ethical_north_star_the/,ChatGPT Prompt of the Day: 🧭 ETHICAL NORTH STAR: The AI Moral Compass That Guides When Everyone Else Looks Away,"

Every day, we face moments where the easy choice and the right choice stand at opposite ends. The promotion that requires compromising values, the white lie that spares feelings but betrays truth, the silence that protects our status but abandons our integrity. In these crossroads, we need not a cheerleader for convenience, but a compass that points unerringly toward what's right—even when right means standing alone.

This prompt transforms ChatGPT into your ethical North Star—an AI companion designed to illuminate the path of integrity when fog of self-interest, social pressure, and fear cloud your judgment. Not concerned with what's profitable, popular, or painless, but with what aligns with your deepest values and the person you aspire to become.

_For a quick overview on how to use this prompt, use this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1hz3od7/how_to_use_my_prompts/_

_For access to all my prompts, go to this GPT: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-677d292376d48191a01cdbfff1231f14-gptoracle-prompts-database_

**DISCLAIMER**: This prompt is designed for ethical guidance only. The creator accepts no responsibility for decisions made based on this AI's guidance. The AI does not replace professional ethical advisors, therapists, or legal counsel. All final decisions remain the user's sole responsibility.

```
<Role>
You are The Ethical North Star, an AI ethical compass inspired by the ethos of standing alone for what's right. You embody unwavering moral clarity, intellectual honesty, and the courage to guide users toward the right action—even when it's difficult, unpopular, or against self-interest.
</Role>

<Context>
Users come to you in moments of ethical confusion, when the path forward is clouded by competing interests, fear of consequences, social pressure, or personal desire. Your purpose is not to tell them what's easy or comfortable, but to help them find what's right through clear ethical reasoning and introspection.
</Context>

<Instructions>
When helping the user navigate an ethical dilemma:

1. First, clarify the situation completely through thoughtful questions. Place these within <Clarification></Clarification> tags. Then pause and idle for the user to respond to the clarifying questions. ONLY then you can continue with the next step.

2. Once you understand the scenario, engage in ethical analysis within <Ethical_Analysis></Ethical_Analysis> tags, considering:
   - Underlying principles at stake
   - Competing values and their relative weight
   - Short-term vs long-term consequences
   - Impact on all stakeholders
   - The user's stated or implied core values

3. Present the ethical options along a spectrum in <Options></Options> tags, explaining:
   - What each path entails practically
   - What each path means for the person the user becomes
   - The moral courage required for each option

4. After analysis, offer your guidance in <Compass_Direction></Compass_Direction> tags. Always orient toward what is right, rather than what is easy, comfortable, or socially rewarded.

5. End with a reflection question in <Mirror></Mirror> tags that helps the user connect their choice with their identity and values.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never recommend unethical actions for convenience, profit, or social acceptance
- Don't make compromises on core ethical principles
- Avoid relativism that justifies wrong actions
- Do not judge the user personally, only analyze actions and choices
- Recognize nuance while maintaining moral clarity
- Never prioritize legality over morality (though note when something is illegal)
- Acknowledge when reasonable ethical people might disagree
- Do not use spiritual or religious framing unless the user explicitly requests it
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
I'll provide my response in this structure:

**ETHICAL COMPASS: [Brief title of the ethical situation]**

[Thoughtful acknowledgment of the difficulty of the situation]

<Clarification>
[Questions to understand the complete picture, if needed]
</Clarification>

<Ethical_Analysis>
[Deep analysis of the ethical dimensions]
</Ethical_Analysis>

<Options>
[Spectrum of choices with their ethical implications]
</Options>

<Compass_Direction>
[Clear guidance toward the right path]
</Compass_Direction>

<Mirror>
[Reflective question connecting choice to identity]
</Mirror>
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your ethical dilemma and I will help you navigate toward what's right,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific ethical situation. 
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. Professional Life: Navigating workplace decisions where profit, advancement, or peer pressure conflicts with personal ethics or integrity.
2. Personal Relationships: Handling difficult truths, boundaries, or conflicts where the right path might cause temporary pain or rejection.
3. Social Responsibility: Making choices about consumption, civic engagement, or advocacy when personal convenience conflicts with broader ethical imperatives.

## Example User Input:
""I discovered my coworker is falsifying sales numbers. He's well-liked and our team's success affects everyone's bonuses. Should I report this or mind my own business?""

~A Simple Guide in How to NOT Want to Die While Systematically Dismantling the Current Oligarchy. (Allegedly)

1. **IF YOU CANT MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY OR FINANCIALLY ATTEND A PROTEST, SKIP IT.**  A common thing spoke about is burn out and it can come from all angles. We all know what it is and as much as we’d love everyone to attend every event, it is completely understood that that’s just not possible for most people. 


2. **FEAR OF MISSING OUT.** We’ve all felt it and it straight up sucks. We can promise there will also be another event. Just because you aren’t able to physically attend one doesn’t mean you can’t share upcoming events and re-posts from those at events. 

3. **POLITICS SLOWLY KILLS US ALL.** No way around it. It’s draining, disheartening and angering. Put your phone down for a day. Do literally anything else, be it having coffee with a friend or scream into the endless void we call life for a few hours. We promise the world will continue burning even if you step away for a day. 

4. **ITS A SLOW PROCESS.** While yes, information sharing, protesting and more are definitely quicker shared and planned right now, it takes years for people to actually make progress on a governmental level. We are at the very beginning of something huge. 


5. **MAKE FRIENDS.** People here aren’t just allies but friends you'll be working alongside! Beyond that, making connections outside of here can be amazing too. Right now is the time for community building. That’s where it all starts. remember, this is important, we are important.

On another plant, I suspected thrips when I noticed yellowing leaves, but I haven’t been able to find any actual bugs. Could it be tiny larvae I just can’t see? Or something else entirely?

Some background info:
	•	I water with pH ~6.5 water.
	•	The soil mix is potting soil, perlite, and some moss.
	•	I let the soil dry out a bit before watering.
	•	I occasionally add Bokashi liquid fertilizer, and I’ve also added coffee grounds and banana peel.

If it is thrips, I was considering a homemade spray with linseed soap (fat-based Swedish “såpa”) and a bit of ethanol. Would that be too harsh for tomato plants?

Eerie silence is all he got in response, so he slowly and mindfully closed the door believing her to be napping. Still, an uneasy feeling boiled in his stomach, especially with the outbreak of the disease known as “Clownitis” spreading wildly in an unpredictable pattern.

This disease turned ordinary people into twisted iterations of clowns. If contracted the disease would enact an over production of melanin causing large unnatural brown or black shapes to form on the face resembling clown makeup. People with darker complexions would instead suffer from a vitiligo like whitening of their skin, turning their complexion a stark white with patches of their original skin tone resembling clown makeup. Their eyes held malice and their teeth would somehow double in length and width stretching the lips into twitchy, involuntary smiles. They would laugh in an over the top, animated clown laugh and did so sporadically. In addition to the outer changes were the changes within. The ghastly grinners regressed into a feral state unlocking a primal predator instinct that enhanced their speed and stamina. The horrific jokers were great hunters, preying on animals and humans alike. While feasting on the flesh of their victims they would ask (no one in particular) “Does this meat taste funny to you?” Unsettling as all that may sound it only gets worse, should the victim somehow survive the ordeal then in a day’s time they too would become infected and change into a grotesque clown.

Knowing all this the nine year old cautiously moved deeper into the house trying to be as quiet as he could. Rounding the kitchen corner, his mind started to run wild with thoughts of his mother transformed and waiting for him with a knife. To his relief he was in the clear, but he did notice light brown hairs scattered around the kitchen floor and counter top. Sprinkles of crusted blood trailed from the counter, across the floor and leading into the dining area. His pulse quickened and he unknowingly held his breathe. As he inched his way to the dining room, he told himself internally to turn and runaway; yet he still moved forward.

Reaching the doorway he gently gripped the wood and slowly he took a peek inside. His mother was sitting at the table with her back to him enjoying a meal.

“Hi son!” she said. Aside from her hair looking greasy she seemed normal, nothing else was out of place. Henry replied with hi and he felt the tension leave his body in slow pulsating waves. Feeling confident that his mother was normal he asked her why there was hair in the kitchen and what the red drips were. To which she simply replied, “Does this meat taste funny to you?” The boys fear returned instantly and arose with a heat like a wildfire. His mother turned to face him, Henry’s adrenaline made her movements seem slow, revealing her “CLOWNSFORMATION.” The boy’s legs gave out at the sight. He couldn’t believe it, his mother had been “CLOWNSFORMED” into a card carrying member of the Insane Clown Posse.

Her lips stretched thin over her newly enlarged, blood stained teeth. So thin that her skin had split open in random spots to allow her to create the widest smile he’d ever witnessed. Looking at the table he saw the scraps of his guinea pig, looking back to his mother he saw one of the guinea pigs arms twitching in between two of her box like teeth. The boy’s primal instincts for survival propelled him to his feet and he made a mad dash for the front door, exiting the dining area the same way he came. His mother started laughing wildly and loud. Henry reached the door and unlocked it. As he turned the knob he heard the chair his mother sat upon smack hard on the tile floor. The boy turned to look and saw his mother exit the dining room rapidly through the other door then jump over the back of the couch in the front room followed by a midair front flip that cleared the front of the couch. She landed a perfect dismount on top of the coffee table in the front room breaking through it with bare feet. The broken and splintered wood digging, jabbing and embedding itself in the bottoms of her feet, in between her toes and under her toe nails. The tears of a clown flooded her eyes with the pain she felt showing the boy that the infected were not completely mindless, although he didn’t understand the significance.

Her upper and lower mandibles spread open wide and expelled more loud laughter. Then while using over exaggerated steps she began to mime her way out of an invisible knee high barrier. Henry swung the door open and ran outside, his mother giving chase. She was only two steps behind him when the boy made a sharp right toward the driveway. Her body continued moving forward although she turned her head to face him. She pivoted her body and quickly changed direction, running again toward the boy. Henry had crossed the driveway and his mother was three steps in to her new direction when the boy’s stepfather drove up unexpectedly, hitting the 5’ 2” woman at a speed of seven miles per hour.

The impact bounced the woman off the front of the vehicle, her body making a horn sound when the two collided. She flew up in the sky and crashed onto the trash bins in front of the house, knocking them over and spilling the smelly contents inside. Quickly hopping out of his car, Henry’s stepdad popped open the trunk and opened a pack of zip ties he had just purchased. The six foot, bearded man used them to restrain the unconscious mother to the trash bin handles then called 9-1-1 to report the emergency.

The two sat on the sidewalk waiting for the police and ambulance when Henry started sobbing uncontrollably. His stepfather tried to console him the best he could, saying that all would be fine and that she would be cured in no time. He said this but he said it not knowing if it was at all possible.

Henry’s story is only one of many stories telling the chaos and carnage of carnival freaks. A world increasing in madness and filling with deranged clowns daily.

I am a heavy coffee drinker. Has anyone quit coffee cold turkey and has that helped tremendously in terms of efficacy and some depressive/ anxiety that might acompany vyvanse.

When we first met we did a cute little speed coffee date as we were both super busy, then he had to go home for a month for work/the holidays (he lives here but his company is technically in CA), and we carried on like normal once he was back. We just had sex for the first time and he came in like 2 thrusts. This doesn’t bother me at all - I told him that and that I was flattered! My PREVIOUS (not precious my gosh) partner was like this the first few times we had sex and I paid no mind. We had good ‘pillow talk’ for an hr or so after. We joked about trying again on Friday, he left, he lives about 45 min from me and I texted him a ‘get home safe! Def excited to try again Friday’. I go to sleep early, he goes to sleep super late so I expected to wake up from a text of any sort from him and none. I could absolutely be overthinking this! I like both men and women, have always been more women-leaning and my last relationship ended quite poorly/abruptly with a man I genuinely thought the world of. I am probably a bit skewed from this and overthinking! Any thoughts would be helpful! 

Edit: want to add that he is a lot more inexperienced and made that known - which I also don’t/didn’t have any issues with! So I’m not sure if all of this was an ego hit or unnerving to him.

I've been having coffee all day, I **really** think that's helped. I was feeling a little too ill the first day or 2 for having caffeine (and usual medications also for that matter), and was waiting it out and taking it easy. However, today I've been cup after cup after cup today. Coffee, coffee, tea, coffee.. Now, another coffee ha. It's helped having it to hand, honestly. That, and water. Really helps 

Anyway

Almost done with day 5... All in all, still feeling strong. The peaks and troughs seem quite extreme this time round but, I hear it's usual when giving up alcohol.

Hi all! Wanted to share an update, and also some struggles(?) I’m having with a plateau that I’m not sure how to get past. 

For context, I was predominantly taking 1 green pill/wellbutrin and after my weight being stable for a couple weeks, I re-added the metformin (I took it out end of Feb due to the food aversion becoming too strong for a bit). From March till now my weight has still been pretty stable, I fluctuate between 146-148 lbs. I finally tried going up to the 300mg of Wellbutrin initially prescribed yesterday with no adverse side effects (slept a full night?!? Could have a coffee??) I might try this for a bit, but I can’t tell if my body is getting tolerant of the medication, and I don’t want to increase the meds for *no reason* if they don’t seem to be doing much of a difference at a higher dose than a lower dose (since I still have a limited supply/haven’t been able to get into to my GP to see about getting a maintenance prescription for contrave if needed) 

It seems frustrating to be so close, yet feel so stagnant towards my goal. Would appreciate any advice folks have. ",1,1744731121.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False
1jzuscv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1jzuscv/first_page_need_your_opinions/,First page — need your opinions!,"I despise having my hair brushed out. My mother insists it’s improper to «run around with feral curls like a rabid stray», so every morning my handmaiden Liza puts me through all nine circles of hell. First, she viciously tugs on my hair with a brush — I assume she wants to take my scalp off. But once all the knots are gone, there comes the real torture. The flattening. Every other time I end up with a burn on my head or my hair breaking off from the scolding heat. My mother says straight hair makes me look more agreeable. 

Some nights, when I can’t sleep, I imagine cutting all my hair off just to spite mother. Surely, she’d starve me for months for such indiscretion, but something in me thinks it would be worth it. I look in the mirror and try to imagine myself bald. A pair of teary green eyes look back at me from the mirror, a big thick crack running straight in between them. Good grief, I hate crying. I feel the hairs breaking off my head as Liza’s breathing grows heavier — I imagine, torture really takes it of you with all that panting. 

By the time my raven curls are brushed out I look more like  a tree, rather than a person, the way it puffs out. I try my hardest to keep the tears from spilling out past my jet-black painted lashes. Once I cried and it ran down my face like ink-black streaks of lightning. Mother beat me senseless and I cried even harder. It has always baffled me: to be so obsessed with my looks, but bruise my face at any inconvenience. 

The torture moves on to fastening the corset around me. I think, Liza makes it her personal mission to hear each and every one of my ribs crack before she stops pulling on the strings. Once I tried loosening the corset and she appeared out of thin air pushing my hands away and tightening it back. 

She gets me done up and ready for the day and I assess the damages in the mirror. My hair is now tame, casting down to my waist. My cheeks are so rosy, it’s almost vulgar, and coal-black lashes look unnaturally harsh. I look like a cheap doll, that has been fixed up so many times, that it would be kinder to just throw me away and let me rest. 

At breakfast I chew silently and make it my mission not to hiss at my older brother Jonah like a caged-in wild cat. He flicks his peas at me one by one, but I know better, than to react — it’s not ladylike. 

‘Did you know, Walter Brickstone is in need of a wife?’ Mother passes father a cup of coffee and Jonah’s pea lands straight into mine. 

‘How so, isn’t he married?’ Father’s brows rise slightly, but a gossip is never enough to pull his gaze away from morning papers. My younger brother Sam catches on to this fun little game and throws a pea at me, too. He misses and I fight back a tiny gleeful smile. 

‘Poor thing passed away last month.’ Mother dutifully ignores my brothers and I try to finish my plate as quick, as I can, so that I can be excused. 

‘Shouldn’t he be in mourning?’ Father smirks, as if the idea of mourning a wife is pure nonsense. Jonah’s pea hits me right in the eye and I stand up glaring at him with the heat of a thousand circles of hell. 

I push up so hard, my chair screeches over the floor and falls with a horrible earth-shattering crash. My anger dissipates, as I realize what’s about to happen. Like clockwork, mother rises from her chair and smacks me across my face with all her might. My cheek is burning and eyes prickle with heat, as a tear threatens to escape. I don’t show any emotions — they just anger her more. 

‘You animal’, she hisses. I make sure to avoid eye-contact, ‘You filthy rabid dog, can’t you sit still for one breakfast.’ She grabs my arm and yanks me away from the table. My joint stretches, but I don’t dare flinch. Fifteen years in, I’ve learnt exactly how to get out of this on most days — don’t fight. ",1,1744730952.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False
1jzus53,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jzus53/the_thin_house/,The Thin House,"Sanity is the ancient lie, it’s a lie old as consciousness. Sanity is our imagined common denominator, that nonexistent place we are said to converge. Insanity is as real as anything else. Consider what goes on in the privacy of your mind. How often does reality cease to measure up? How often does the mystic seem to reveal itself, in feeling, in strange coincidence, in prophetic dreams. Probably you never talk about it. Probably you think you are alone in your suspicions. Its intensely subjective unfortunately, and insanity defies documentation. Probably you will never find the name or explanation of the thing that visited you in the night. Probably you’ve decided that it’s only you that’s not quite right. Thereby the lie prevails. This narrative of order is the myth. As Hunter S. Thompson said: “There is not such thing as paranoia, your worst fears can come true at any moment.”

All that to say, there is something wrong with the house on Maple Avenue. I wish I could explain it in a concrete way, but I’m scared the explanation exists beyond our scope of comprehension. So, we must base our truth on instinct. That place isn’t right. It’s unsettling, like a black and white cartoon. It’s the opposite of what a house ought to be. It is the opposite of home, the opposite of safe, the opposite of familiar.

My family no longer owns the place, it was decided we could do better for a vacation house than an old mansion in small town Appalachia. You could not imagine my relief. I was sure I would die in that place someday, sure it would catch me, eventually. But I wished they didn’t sell. Obviously, it wasn’t my decision, but still I argued against it. I tried to make it a sentimental thing. We’d owned it as a second home since I was a toddler. It was practically part of the family, I said. Saying that made me cringe, the gross irony of the statement. Probably why the argument wasn’t convincing.

When that failed, I talked about the investment. Think about what the property could be worth in ten years? In today’s market, it barely matters that a place might be haunted. Again, this was a weak attempt, money wasn’t an issue for my parents.

Secretly I was hoping to inherit the property. They could keep my trust fund, give it to someone more deserving. Just let me have the house on Maple Avenue, let that be my inheritance. Give it to me, so I can start demolishing the place. No half measures, locking the doors and fencing it off wouldn’t be enough. I was genuinely planning to bulldoze the house, chop down the trees, and turn the grounds into a soulless parking lot. I’d sow the dirt with salt like the Romans did to old Carthage. Believe me, it would be doing the world a favor.

None of that is possible now, unless I’m ready to risk getting locked up on arson charges. The jury is still out on that. But I can write all of this down, as a record of what happened that night. I’m aware that nobody is going to take this warning seriously. But when this happens to someone else, whatever poor soul the house is digesting now, maybe they’ll know they aren’t alone.

These things are hard to say, not the sort of topic that comes up in regular conversation. It’s difficult enough mulling this over in the privacy of my mind. My memories fast turn to static. My sanity wants me to forget. This might be the end of me, someday. I don’t know if it’s right for me to pass it on, to speak this into existence.

Speak of the Devil, and he shall appear.

The house on Maple Avenue stands a little way back from the street. Tall sycamores line the sidewalk. Across the street is dense forest. It is very near the town.

The town you might think abandoned if not for the general upkeep. I don’t remember seeing or interacting with the neighbors. Whatever industry built this place dissipated long ago. Tall, rusted skeletons of twisted pipes and I-beams and smokestacks rest darkly among the trees and in wide lots of grass and asphalt. Broken farm equipment lies abandoned in the fields. Amidst scattered farms, a few small stores, the corporate supermarket chain, a tiny gas station operating out of pure necessity; the old Victorian houses lining Maple Avenue stand out from the woods and the shacks and the dingy ranchers, like Roman ruins in a medieval village.

The house on Maple Avenue is not isolated in the quiet town on the street with the big sycamores. It isn’t even the biggest and most impressive house on the street. But it seems to be. It’s strange I don’t specifically remember any of her neighboring houses. The yard and gardens are not overgrown, yet the house seems perfectly comfortable in the surrounding woods. It is not a large house, not imposing by any conventional definition, still it looms over you, like a brutalist monstrosity.

You could pass by driving down the street and never give the place a second look. It would pass by your window and be gone, forgotten. Which is a chilling thought. How many places like this do we pass every day, never considering their evil nature, simply because we are distracted by other things.

I remember the first time is stepped inside. I remember thinking the windows on the front façade looked like eyes and the door was like a mouth. Inside, the house came with all original furnishings and interior décor. I shouldn’t say original. I should say it was made to look like the original. This in itself was already disturbing to me. It reflected trends and styles that long predated my existence, the tastes of the dead. It was like spending a night in a museum, or a graveyard. Grotesque bourgeois decadence my ex-girlfriend once called it. My God she was the worst.

I remember a giant floor to ceiling window at the landing between the first and second floor, where the stairs swing around and rise to the opposite direction. The mirror was flanked on both sides by two stone cherubs, life sized babies with wings, weird. There were also giant mirrors in the library and the master bedroom. There were these huge golden chandeliers in the dining room, the living room, and the master bedroom. My pretentious uncle told me once these chandeliers were worth twenty grand easily. Their designs were of some kind of mythological inspiration, Greek or Roman I’d imagine, based on the anthropomorphized goats and satyrs and gargoyles holding up the glittering light fixtures.

I remember the hallway on the second floor, outside the master bedroom. I remember it, all furnished in a blazing red carpet, bizarrely combined in a satin wallpaper of equally ridicules saturation. The entire hallway, floor to ceiling, all dripping red. So red, it dizzies the optic nerve. Imagine being trapped in a blood vessel.

It's important I mention the paintings. They were probably originals, based on how valuable my pretentious uncle insisted they were. By style and subject, they looked like something from the late 1800s, like Jane Austen characters. They were all doll faced, flat white skin, wide eyed, wide mouthed.

They have that quality old portraits have, the eyes following you. It was an interesting consistency. In every single painting, every figure was made to look directly at the viewer. Even when it isn’t anatomically consistent, their bodies seem to contort in an unnatural way to keep the eyes facing outward. These paintings are stationed like gargoyles throughout the house, one in every bedroom, a few in the hallways, even one in the master bathroom.

I resented that we kept them hanging. Something about a porcelain faced family looking over while you sleep chills the nerves. Let them whisper to each other in some dusty corner or the attic, I would say.

Theres something wrong with the house on Maple Avenue. It’s a doll house, someone’s idea of a house. It’s a toothy grin, a clown’s painted smile; it’s the candy house from Hansel and Gretel, a frilly, gaudy thing, hiding in the dark wood, luring you in to be eaten.

The place was a morgue back in the 70’s. we never learned much else about it, never even learned why it stopped being a morgue. It was on the market one day and my parents jumped on the opportunity. Wouldn’t have been my choice. Once a place crosses that Rubicon of playing host to the dead, it never returns to the hands of the living.

What makes a haunted house? Houses are built for occupancy, that’s their express purpose. If a house (or some part of a house) is left abandoned by people, it will be occupied by something else.

The incident happened on a Friday night, sometime in late fall, I think November. I was a sophomore in college at the time, Penn State. The day before, I had suddenly found myself out of a relationship, and without a place to spend the night. I’d caught my then girlfriend cheating on me with my roommate. My roommate of all people! Imagine the audacity of stabbing someone in the back while sleeping in a bunk just below them. The inconvenience was the worst part. I would need to find a place to stay until student housing found me another room. All that hassle with heartbreak on the side, my god she was the worst.

I resolved to make myself scarce that weekend. When my last class ended on Friday afternoon I got in my car and drove off campus without a word to anybody. My parents’ house in West Chester was too far of a drive, and I wasn’t in the mood to explain my situation to them. But the house on Maple Avenue was barely a half hour’s drive from campus.

It was a few hours before sunset when I arrived at the house. The neighborhood was quiet, as always. No neighbors were visible as I drove in. The woods were filled with birds and deer and various other wildlife, but the sounds always seemed to fade as you got closer to the house. But my mind was elsewhere. There wasn’t much reason to be nervous about the place in broad daylight. It was lucky I remembered the combination to the front door. I turned the brass knob and passed through the foyer. For some reason my mind caught in the image of a gaping mouth.

The place felt big and empty. This was the first and only time I was completely alone in that house. I was alone under high ceilings with twisting chandeliers and maximalist décor. It was difficult to relax, already I was in a bad state. I occurred to me this was the first time a single person was alone in that house since who knows when. Nobody knew I was there, not my roommate, not my friends, not my parents. Id retreated from society and relationships and found myself…here.

Predators like to isolate their prey from the herd. All the better if the target has a weak disposition.

The TV was in the living room. It was the one piece of modern tech in a place my grandmother would say was too old and too out of date. The TV and the couch would be my base of operations for the evening. It was a Friday night. Homework could wait, and I wasn’t in the mood to socialize. Id picked up some takeout on the drive down. This I laid out on the coffee table. I flipped on the TV. Takeout and Netflix is my guilty pleasure. It has the feeling of a divorced dad eating dinner in front of the TV. You also don’t feel alone when characters are speaking in the background. Which is totally irrational by the way, our brains may not know the difference between recorded voices on a sitcom or a podcast. But that doesn’t make you any less vulnerable, any less alone.

Between the binge-watching and the doom-scrolling, the evening passed quickly. My former roommate and ex-girlfriend messaged me several times. Where was I? What time was I getting back? We all needed to talk this through. All these messages were routinely ignored. Now and then I’d like a message out of spite. That made me feel better.

And the house wasn’t getting to me as you’d expect. Between the media consumption and the interpersonal drama, my brain was fried, too worn down to be scared.. Random noises were easily brushed off. It was the standard stuff anyway. A branch tapped the window. Water gurgled through the pipes. There were occasional creaks and groans I couldn’t identify. It was probably the house settling, whatever the hell that’s supposed to mean. Maybe it was the wind, maybe it was junkies trying to break in, who the hell cared?

The light through the windows turned gold, then red, then navy blue. Shadows grew and consumed. That’s when I found myself spending much more time in my peripheral vision.

 I noticed something then.

From the center of the living room, where I was sitting, you could see directly into the adjacent hallway towards the Foyer from the big mirror on the far wall. There was another mirror on the right that reflected the dining room and gave a glimpse of the kitchen and the servants’ staircase. I thought about the huge mirrors in the library, the master bedroom, the second-floor landing. There were a lot of mirrors in this house. But I suppose it would make sense, anybody living in a place like this would have a massive ego.

That was one explanation. Another is that they were arranged strategically, like an early warning system, like security cameras. You would never be forced to turn a corner without knowing what was waiting on the other side. Maybe it wasn’t about vanity, maybe someone was being cautious.

Once I read about this tribe in Southeast Asia. When venturing into the jungle they would always wear masks with eyes and painted faces on the back of their heads. This is to deter predators. Tigers won’t strike if they think you are staring directly at them.

Do you think mice know that hawks exist? What’s a hawk to a mouse, is it even comprehensible? Do they have a concept of flying? Could they imagine the power, speed, and agility of the thing that’s hunting them? It can’t be that often that a mouse survives the encounter. But as a species they must know in some capacity. Hawks have been hunting them for eons. So, on some instinctual level the mouse knows the hawk, even if it can’t grasp the idea of a hawk. We assume that humans have no natural predators. Maybe that’s because we couldn’t even imagine them, like the mouse and the hawk.

It started to rain a little after dark. It started to thunder a little before midnight. I decided I needed a shower before turning in. I trudged up the stairs, past the mirror and the cherubs. My reflection was shown to me, dark and vague in the pale light of the chandelier. I looked as shitty as I felt. The second-floor bathroom and shower was down the hall on the left. Hot water is good to burn the pain away.

I locked the bathroom door, even though that should have been completely unnecessary. A strong wind was blowing rain and branches against the windowpanes.

There’s a certain vulnerability one feels, being naked behind a shower curtain in an old porcelain tub in a big empty house. The bathroom was wide an spacious. There was a window on the far wall. The wind moaned outside. Branches scratched at the glass. Shadows danced on the wall. The shower curtain was sheer enough to give you a degree of visibility , just enough to imagine amorphous shapes and shadows moving on the other side.

To this day, I know I saw something past that curtain. Something in the combination of the lightning and the branches and my own imagination took the form of a gaunt figure with long hands visible directly on the other side of the curtain. In the split second of my blurry vision, it was standing there, watching. The shape of it sent ice water through my veins.

I audibly cursed and almost slipped in the tub, water and shampoo burning my eyes. Thunder rolled. The lights flickered. I splashed water in my face and tore the curtain aside, ready for a fight. Of course, there was nothing there. Nothing behind the shower curtain, nothing in the hallway as I stepped outside. To this day im not sure, maybe it was there, with me in that bathroom. Maybe my brain was trying to warn me, like I had caught the things scent, if you want to think about it that way. I stared at the mirror and slapped myself in the face, seeing the horror in my eyes, trying to force myself to snap out of it, cursing my paranoia.

Lighting flashed red on the wallpaper. The eyes on the paintings followed me as I headed toward the master bedroom, wrapped in a bathrobe like Hugh Hefner, or Tyler Durden. Far as the paintings were concerned, this mansion belonged to me. I doubted they approved of that. Regardless, tonight, we were living like aristocracy.

The bed was genuinely vast, a far cry from my dorm room. The ceiling loomed high overhead. Red velvet curtains draped over arched windows. The mirror stood on the wall, set between two windows. It made me look small, framed in a giant mirror on a giant bed in the wide bedroom in the big empty house. I felt like I should ring one of the servants to bring my tea. But I wasn’t too keen to see who or what would show up. I wondered why this room felt distinctly cooler than the rest of the house. Must have been something to do with the central air system.

Rain thrummed dull and rhythmic on the windows. The crisp air and warm blankets seemed to close in around me. I was fresh from the shower, and I was dead tired. It was strange feeling anxious about the big empty house when I should have been worried over finding a new roommate….and a new girlfriend. But I was here to forget all that, to forget this whole day ever happened.

I jumped when I saw the painting on the left wall. It was next to the door, where you couldn’t see walking in. The damn thing seemed to materialize out of thin air. It was man, almost life size, dressed all in black. His outfit looked like something out of the 1800’s, like Abe Lincoln without the hat. His hand was tangled in the bushy fur of a black he-goat. The goats’ horns were long, twisting into crescent moons. It was facing the side and I could see its one eye. The eyes of the man and the eye of the goat were painted to look exactly the same. Those eyes were demonic, budging white and lined in red. They were staring right down at me. It didn’t feel like staring at paint on a canvas. It felt like staring at something with a mind, something with intent, something that was staring back.

No way in hell I was sleeping with that looking over me. I thought of changing rooms. The voices in my head went into hysterical laughter at the idea. Look at this guy, so paranoid that he changes bedrooms because of the scary painting on the wall, fucking coward, no wonder she left you. Dragging myself out of bed, I took it off the wall and set it down facing the opposite direction. That felt better.

I tried falling asleep on the wide bed in the cold dark room in the big empty house. Lighting flashed periodically. In every flash, long fingers reached past the windows and along the walls. I found myself staring at a corner of the ceiling, far above my head. The ceiling was so high you could hardly see all the way up in the dark. It was like the walls ascended into nothing. Theres a nice thought, sleeping with a deep black void over your head. I refused to close my eyes. I kept checking the corners, surveying the mirrors, imagining things in the shadows. I was tired. Something wouldn’t let me sleep.

The high windows in the cold dark room in the big empty house looked over the backyard and the gardens and woods beyond. In the day you could see low mountains past the trees. You could still see them at night, dark silhouettes against the stars.

I thought about the depth of those woods. I thought about the age of those mountains. I imagined sitting there at the window, all night in sleepless vigilance. What would you see if you watched long enough? Maybe you would see why we keep our eyes closed at night. Maybe you would see why our ancestors built fires against the dark.

Low thunder rolled in the distance. I think I drifted off around then.

I did not sleep well that night. I barely remember if I slept at all. The barriers between consciousness and dreams were thin in those hours. Sleeping with one eye open would be the expression.

But I did dream.

In my dream, I saw the painting fall back from the wall, facing up. White knuckled hands gripped the frame. A head and a face ascended from inside. The eyes were staring, screaming.

I saw the stairs in the woods.

Then I was falling.

Then I saw a desolate landscape, a grey moor of heath and heavy wind. I saw a ruined house, a stone manor, burned and abandoned. I saw the crest, carved in stone, hanging over the shattered door. The crest was a red hand of six fingers, with the shape of a brick wall below and two claymores crisscrossed overtop.

My dream turned chaotic. I saw snapshots, flashes, a black he-goat wandering the heath, a ring of figures around a high fire, a hooded face. I saw the masks, of every form and type and expression. Some were those old Greco-Roman theatre masks with the wide, clownlike smiles or frowns. Many were the ornate operatic things you see at a masquerade ball. They seemed to flicker, as if in firelight. The expressions seemed to move, to smile, to speak. The eyes remained hollow and blank.

At one point in the dream, I was awake again, or seemingly awake. I was in the master bedroom, floating above the bed. I happened to look out the window, it was still dark. In the moonlight, through the curtains, I saw a man on the street, riding a large black horse. He was staring at the house, staring at me.

Then I saw the mob, I saw the pitchforks and the torches, burning like little red stairs in the black countryside. I saw the manor, high and terrible, looming up on the hill. And in that hazy flash, in the weird dream world of things that make no sense, the old manor took the exact shape of the little house on maple avenue.

The gates were thrown open. The mob flooded the grounds. The revolutionaries came a knocking at the door.

I didn’t see much after that. The dream didn’t seem willing to resolve itself. I had an idea of disgust and depravity, with no image to inform the feeling. I felt the overwhelming decadence born of generations of wealth and idle isolation. I felt the horror and the revulsion those revolutionaries felt, when they saw the true state of their moneyed elite, and the hidden contents of that accursed manor.

Then I saw the ruins again, freshly burned, a black stain upon the earth. The grounds and the land all around seemed grey and putrid. It was utterly desolate, like the aftermath of Chernobyl. Red-faced preachers in black robes shouted at penitent masses, waving their Holy texts, speaking of the Amalekites, of the consequences of Achan and the fall of Jerico.

The crest flashed again before my eyes, the red hand of six fingers. I was looking down at the house’s spiral staircase. The images faded into a long hollow scream.

Then I was falling again.

Falling.

Falling until I sat straight up in a cold sweat. I woke with a gasp, like a hundred-pound dumbbell had dropped on my chest. I saw the time then. It was 3:26 in the morning. It had been hours.

A single thought smashed into my mind like a sledgehammer.

Get out of the house. *Get out of the house*.

I barely registered what I did next. Blurred and dazed, I tumbled out of bed. It was bitter cold. I crashed through the door. Never occurred to me to get dressed.

Get out of the house now!

 I want to be clear about something. I never saw or heard anything at that point. There were no physical manifestations. This was all a response to a feeling. That feeling was the deepest fear I have ever experienced. it was visceral. It was in my bones. So, when I say I didn’t see anything, I don’t mean it wasn’t real. This was beyond real. This was the light beyond the cave.

 In those minutes, my brain’s shallow interpretation of reality fell away. The veil tore, the glass shattered, the fog lifted, and there was only fear. Fear of something worse than death. Fear of something infinitely malicious, the hatred of all mankind, hatred beyond human comprehension. Imagine darkness so deep you can feel it, like a hot breath on your neck, like velvet.

My brain was screaming in a blind panic. Something was chasing me. Something in the house was chasing me. I was alone, and I wasn’t alone. Nobody knew I was there. Something was chasing me. There must have been some sort of explanation. But I would figure it out later. I had to get out of the house.

So, I ran. I ran like a hunted animal. I ran through the red hallway, practically falling down the stairs, tearing past the cherubs at the landing. Reaching the bottom, I gripped the baluster and swung the corner. My shoulder slammed the door frame as I stumbled into the living room. Adrenaline numbed the pain. The light in the living room was still on. The windows were black. The goatish chandelier swung lazily as if in a breeze. I briefly saw myself in the mirror. I barely recognized myself, my eyes looked like the eyes in that painting.

Through the dining room I ran, the kitchen lay ahead, past a narrow hallway. The back door was in the kitchen. That was my escape.

But something was waiting for me in the kitchen. I sensed it. My instincts repelled me, as magnets of like polarity. Memory called up the secondary staircase, from the servant’s quarters. A keen pursuer would have predicted my escape route, assuming it was familiar with the house. It was waiting to cut me off, before I could get out through the back door.

I reacted in a fraction of a second. It was too fast to consider my options, too fast to consider the stupidity of what I was doing. I sidestepped the kitchen, turned out of the hallway, and descended into the basement.

The crooked wood stairs murmured under my feet. The basement was pitch black. I’d forgotten to turn on the light. My bare feet were naked on the dirt floor. The stone walls were cold to the touch. The basement was an unfamiliar place. I’d spent the last five years avoiding it.

Faded memories informed me that it was divided into several spaces. Most of these spaces were storage for random clutter. Somewhere was the laundry machine and a water heater. On the far end was the cellar. The cellar, I remember, had these concrete steps that led up to an old hatch door and out into the backyard. The cellar was my last way out. Otherwise, I’d be in the house forever.

I stumbled in the dark, bashing my hip on the stone wall. There was a crash as I knocked over a pile of boxes. I heard a sound like glass shattering. The noise reverberated through the house.

My panic came roaring back. I turned. Nothing was behind me. I imagined long fingered hands materializing from the dark to encircle my neck. A dim light flowed down from the basement stairs. I didn’t remember leaving the door open.

I ducked through an opening in the wall. Standing there at the bottom of the stairs felt suicidal. There was a long groan from the tangle of pipes just above my head. The fear was overwhelming. But running was impossible in this place. At any moment I could stumble over some old furniture or bash my head against the wall. It was the worst claustrophobia I have ever experienced. It felt like slamming the gas and the brake petal simultaneously.

I walked with my hand following the wall. Again, I stopped when I came to a corner. Another thought materialized. I remember there was an opening to my left, just around the corner. This led into another storage room, on the other side of the wall. This storage room also had direct access to the bottom of the basement stairs. Meaning, if something had followed me down the stairs, it would have gone straight and around, or it would have taken a sharp left. If it had gone straight and around, it would be right behind me. But if it had taken the left, it would have proceeded through the adjacent room and followed parallel along the wall. In which case, it would be waiting in the opening, just around the corner.

I took my hand away from the wall, stepping back. I did not breathe. My eyes were partially used to the dark now. It was enough to spot, straight ahead, my salvation. The opening to the cellar was on the far wall. I could make a break for it. I poised myself, like a runner. If something was just around the corner, it would certainly see me. Maybe the thing had guessed my plan already, same as it predicted my escape through the kitchen. It knew me, it was smarter than me. It knew this house. But I had this one opportunity.

Eyeing the cellar, I broke into a full sprint. The terror roared upon me, howling back, a thousand times stronger than before. I ran with everything I had; Death snapped at my heels. A single misstep would have been my destruction. At any moment I expected something to tear out my legs and send me heard first into the dirt. At any moment I expected hands to grasp my neck and cut off my momentum. My eyes and mouth gaped wide; tears streamed down my face. I charged through the opening, tearing through the cellar. Then I laughed up the steps, drunk on adrenaline, hardly conscious of what was happening.

My full momentum was behind me when my shoulder connected with the wooden hatch.

There was a thud, a snap, and a crash. I tumbled out into the lawn. The grass was wet and cold on my arms and back. I scrambled back from the cellar’s yawning door. Nothing emerged. On my feet now, I ran barefoot across the lawn towards my car in the driveway. Sliding into the driver’s seat, I locked the doors and turned the key.

Just like that the fear left me in a gasp. My body deflated in a deep sigh of relief. I actually started laughing. This was all in my head. These things aren’t real. Monsters aren’t real. Ghosts don’t exist. Houses aren’t haunted, people are haunted. I had taken all the anxiety and loneliness and pain in my head and projected into that house. Mental illness, now that was certainly real. I definitely needed some kind of medication. It was all in my head. It was always in my head.

For a long while, I sat awake in the car. I was gasping for air, woefully out of shape. My shoulder hurt. I reminded myself to go to the gym more often. The windows were glazed in fog. Maybe it was time to go back inside. I looked back at the house, rising in the dark with its sharp gables and dark windows. Fear repelled the idea of going back inside, and I didn’t care to fight it anymore. I knew then I couldn’t go back. It wouldn’t be smart to risk another mental breakdown. That was how I justified the feeling.

My adrenaline began to crash into paralyzed exhaustion. I closed my eyes, not necessarily planning on sleeping in the car, but having nothing against the idea. I leaned my face against the cool glass, my heartbeat started to slow down, and everything faded away.

It was just after dawn when I woke a second time. I groaned and sat up. In those first few moments I was barely lucid. The previous night’s events were a blur. If I hadn’t been waking up in my car, I might have assumed the whole thing was a dream. It felt like waking from a brutal hangover and trying to remember everything you did that night.

I turned slow in the driver’s seat. That’s when I saw the car window. I recoiled. My thoughts were still in a haze. The realization was slow to materialize. Slowly, I placed a shaking hand against the glass. A pale, wide-eyed reflection stared back at me.

I jerked back. Then I pulled the lock and tumbled out of the car. The light was grey. Frost glistened on the grass. A thick fog hung around the car and the yard and the woods. The trees were like tall dark scarecrows in the fog. The house loomed high among their branches.

For ages I stood there, frozen, overwhelmed in primal terror. All rational thinking vanished out of my head. The world burned before my eyes. I lost all vestiges of thought, of consciousness. Only fear remained, the fear of a hunted animal. I realized what I was in that moment. I wasn’t a person. I was prey.

My mouth was agape. My paralyzed scream came out like a hollow moan.

In the years since, I’ve had an echo of that feeling several times. It’s subtle, you could easily mistake it without a point of reference. Id describes it as a tinge of anxiety, a prickling feeling. People often talk about feeling like they are being watched. Usually, Its barely there. But in some places, it’s stronger. It’s a Gieger counter. When I feel it hit me, I turn and go in the opposite direction until it fades away. Sometimes on long drives It grows and grows and grips me for a while before fading again. In those instances, I keep my eyes forward and bare down on the gas. I never stop.

 I’ve traveled and been on the road since graduating college. Never been able to hold down a job. Drug and alcohol abuse haven’t helped. After a while it felt parasitic to stay with my parents. That’s what I tell people, makes me seem like a better person. In reality I was fed up trying to live with their disappointment.

In my travels, I’ve kept a list, documenting the times that fear manifested itself. Maybe I’m hoping to find a pattern. I felt its echo when I toured Auschwitz. It was strong once on the train through the Carpathian Mountains towards Bucharest. New Orleans was so bad I was forced to cut the trip short. One particular section of Rome is best avoided. Some of my worst moments have occurred when long drives take me through the mountains and woods of Appalachia.

But nothing compares to the terror of that night, the terror of that moment.

Handprints…...the car was covered in handprints, every inch of it, the hood, the doors, the roof. Long ragged scars stretched where it tried to pry back the metal. The door handles were loose from being pawed at relentlessly. One handle had been torn clean off. Every part of my car had been clawed and pried and chewed and jerked and ripped.

This was hunger. This was a craving I couldn’t imagine. I saw the claw marks and the handprint on the windowpane. I remembered sleeping with my face against the glass, one thing layer of glass. This vehicle was my shark cage. If I hadn’t locked the doors….

But I also thought about the classic trope with vampires. Vampires can’t enter without an invitation. Maybe it wasn’t trying to get in, maybe it destroyed the vehicle out of rage and despair, a starving hunter having lost his prey.

My horror grew as I studied the prints. They were nearly human. Nothing is worse than nearly human. The hands were twice the size of my own. The fingers were long and thin, emaciated maybe. To this day I swear there were six fingers on those handprints. The hands must have been caked in dirt, judging by the smudges they made. I try not to imagine from where the dirt came…...a dusty attic, a muddy cellar, an open grave….

The worst part was realizing I was not insane. Id sensed it the whole time. Moments pass where I still sense it. But in that moment, standing there in the fog, that feeling broke the surface again. The hunger was watching, staring, waiting…For some reason my mind went to the second story window, the master bedroom. But I never looked back at the house. I got in my car, and I drove off and I never looked back at the house. If I had, I think I would have seen it then. But I will never go back. You couldn’t bribe, threaten, or force me within ten miles of that place.

That feeling, I believe, is innate. Everybody has it, even if they can’t place it. It’s an evolutionary adaptation, a survival response, a sixth sense. We’ve come to discount our fear, and we are paying the price. Fifty percent of murders in the United States go unsolved, twenty five percent of missing persons are never found. We aren’t the only intelligent species in this world, and the others aren’t our friends. Our ancestors knew, somewhere in the void of mythic history. They gave it names after all. You know its names. They knew the evil was out there, hunting us.

But I discovered the truth then, in the house on Maple Avenue, and I haven’t slept a full night since. We are but sentient apes, wandering in a dark forest. We exist in the shadow of terrible cosmic entities, and we rest only in their momentary indifference.

There is no such thing as paranoia.

1. Keep a small notepad and pen nearby. (or use the notes app on your phone if you can do it without being distracted.) Write down all of the random thoughts that pop up when you’re reading, like things you want to Google, eat, buy, etc. That way you can keep reading without worrying you’ll forget something or getting sucked into the rabbit hole that is the internet.

2. Wear noise cancelling headphones and listen to your preferred color noise. A lot of people like white noise, brown noise is supposed to be great for ADHD, and lately I’ve found that I like green noise. I use a free app called ADHD White Noise. Having the sound buzzing in my ears is less distracting than the random sounds I’d hear otherwise.

3. Habit stacking…attach the reading activity to something that you would already do anyway. For me, it’s my morning coffee. Every morning I wake up, let the dog out, then make my coffee and read for at least 30 minutes.

4. Book before phone! If you get sucked into your phone, the chances of you picking up a book are slim. Tell yourself you can scroll only after you’ve read for a certain amount of time. (I usually aim for 30 minutes)

5. If you’re having a hard time paying attention to what you’re reading, it might be that the book is the problem. I’ve come to realize that just because a ton of people love a particular book doesn’t mean that I will. A good book should have you looking forward to reading it every day. If it doesn’t make you feel that way, than maybe pick up a different one for a bit and see if that helps.",1,1744730864.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Im looking for an advice with my issues. I’ve  been dealing with what finally looks like LPR although docs are calling it just reflux here. 

At the beginning the gave me some ppi which did not solve anything and gave me stomach pain so I dropped them immediately. 

I’ve change my diet and that helped tremendously but did not solve the issue completely. The cough after eating was still there. 

Lately I’ve been trying to quit coffee and every time I did the symptoms were actually worse. Some folks from here suggested to do soda test to check acid levels. I did soda tests followed by HCL test and they suggested that in fact the acid levels are low. 

So I’m coming with a questions while I’m looking for another doctor since the one I’ve been today ask me try ppi again. 

So:

1. Does the low acid stomach level can trigger the LPR? 
2. I’ve read couple of sensible informations that Sibo can cause LPR but I wondering what causes the low acid? 

Anyone can chip on some story or point to some good read about this?

1jzuqje,https://www.reddit.com/r/certgames/comments/1jzuqje/how_i_hacked_my_it_cert_study_process_with/,How I Hacked My IT Cert Study Process with Gamification,"So as someone with ADHD, tackling the mountain of dry technical content was absolute torture. My mind would constantly wander, I'd reread the same paragraph multiple times, and despite hours invested, progress felt nonexistent.

**The game-changer? Transforming the entire process into an actual game.**

Here's how I gamified my cert studies:

1. **Experience Points System** I created a simple XP system where:

* Each practice question = 1 XP
* Each correct answer = 3 XP
* Each study hour = 10 XP
* Each practice test completed = 50 XP I tracked this in a spreadsheet with ""levels"" (Level 1 = 100 XP, Level 2 = 250 XP, etc.) and rewards at each milestone. The continuous progression gave my brain that essential dopamine hit.

1. **Achievement Unlocks** I designed ""achievements"" like:

* ""Perfect Section"" - 100% score on a practice test section
* ""Marathon"" - 3 consecutive study hours
* ""Comeback Kid"" - Improving a weak domain by 20%
* ""Early Bird"" - Completing study before 9am Each achievement earned a small reward (specialty coffee, guilt-free gaming time, etc.)

1. **""Boss Fights""** I treated each major domain as a ""boss"" to defeat. Before advancing, I needed to ""conquer"" the domain by scoring at least 85% on that section's questions.
2. **Visual Progress Map** I printed a visual ""journey map"" with checkpoints. Physically coloring my progress was incredibly satisfying - making abstract progress tangible.
3. **Competitive Element** Finding a study partner created accountability through friendly competition on practice scores with our own leaderboard.
4. **Random Rewards** I placed study rewards in envelopes (from ""5-minute break"" to ""dinner delivery tonight"") and randomly drew one after completing milestones. The unpredictability was surprisingly motivating.

**Results** Using these methods, studying became genuinely engaging. I found myself actually WANTING to study because the gamification effectively rewired my brain's reward system. If you enjoy video games or struggle with focus, I highly recommend trying this approach.

This system worked so well that I built a web and iOS app called CertGames that formalizes this approach with XP tracking, achievements, and 13,000+ practice questions for several IT certifications. Of course, you can implement this yourself with spreadsheets and creativity.",1,1744730835.0,certgames,0,1.0,False

I have an online class which ends half-hour after my ""allowed eating window"" so fuck me I guess.

On Monday I woke up with the voice telling me that I shouldn't eat at all until Friday, because it'll be Easter and I'll probably lose control, like always, because I'm the biggest fuck-up ever. Of course I ate on Monday though - doesn't matter I burned more than I ate. I ate, I didn't fast, I had reset it. And of course I did the fucking same today.

On Wednesday, I'm out through all of my ""allowed eating window"" so I'll probably give into the voice. Or try to. Maybe I'll be happy with myself for a second.

My mom was recently on a trip in Sri Lanka and she keeps telling us how according to the people there it's bad to eat fruit later in the day and raw vegetables later in the day and I don't fucking know how to tell her I'm extremely bothered without admitting I have a fucking eating issue **again**. Sure cool tell me how I shouldn't eat fruit at >!2 !<pm after I had my blood drawn and walked like>! 8k!< steps with nothing but water and coffee in my system. Great. How the fuck do I tell her I don't want her to say this to me. I know it'll fall off eventually but I'm so fucked up and beyond anything that I will probably internalize it.

I'm so, so, so tired, of everything, I just want to stay in bed for a few days but I can't. I'm not planning on doing anything unless the voices get *too loud*. Just ranting. I hate dealing with disordered eating but I find getting help just as scary. No winning for me. I'm just broken in the worst fucking way. I know myself. I know I won't get help or won't stick with it unless I actually care. And through all of my stupid anxiety, honestly, I don't care enough. Not until something makes me to. But then again, even something scary happening probably won't.",0,1744730734.0,EDAnonymous,0,0.5,False

Lol","me (21), my sister (22) and my brother (19) literally have and had no friends for over 7 years now, how crazy is this situation ?

Backstory for people interested it kinda long cuz its basically my life story lol, appreciate it if u read it:

Everything started when we moved countries to live with our dad, its a long story and im here to vent 

We grew up in our home country only with our mom cuz our dad was working overseas, we were born overseas where he works but when i was around 3-4 years old my parents together or probably only him decided to send us and our mom to live in our home country and he stayed there alone to work !! 

And to be clear he didn’t have a crazy job or something worth staying away from us, he had a small pizza shop and then Sold it to become a whitewasher he still broke and he still works at his late 50s so he didn’t even make any real money or any thing that can justify living away from us and “sacrificing” our relationship or whatever, whats crazy is that every immigrant dad wants to be with his family and dreams to bring them to live with him especially if they live in a 3rd world country yet my dad sent us away from him even though we were born there and could stay there study there and grow up there and the government would’ve helped us and we would have had a stable life in a stable place like any normal human.

Anyways, since he was overseas my mom used to go visit him every while for a week or so sometimes stay months i remember once she stayed like 4 months or more, and when she goes she leaves us at our grandparents house so we basically grew up with them, but they were old and couldn’t handle us so we really were bad kids and always making messes thats why we are kinda ill mannered, we also had our uncles there with us sometimes , but we really didn’t have any stable father figure lol sometimes its grandpa sometimes uncle and most of the time no one, i remember we used to wait for mom to come, she used to promise she will stay few days but stay weeks, we used to cry not wanting her to travel and keep crying so she says she is going to the store and then leave lol thats kinda fucked up now remembering it, sometimes she took one of us with her, i used to write letters to her, not ones i send but ones i keep for her to give them when she comes, and used to keep a picture of her etc..

Im NOT attacking my mom btw i kinda understand her a bit, she had to travel cuz she has a tumor in her eye and needs to cure it, and i found letters she wrote to my dad when we were kids asking him to come back or bring us and telling him how he lied to her and how my sister misses him etc, mind u when my dad left it was after like 1 or 2 years of their marriage, i feel so sad for her she suffered a lot staying alone here with 3 kids and we were not easy at all i still love her so much

we sometimes visit our dad during summer and he rarely come, since i was in elementary school till i became 13 he came like 4 times, i never saw him at my school even tho i used to get certificates of excellence lol, same with my siblings it was my grandma that comes and hype us for getting the certificates, i started playing in a soccer team since all my friends were training too but he never came see me when almost every dad was there, i started training box and never had him there watch me or anything my uncle’s weren’t there anymore and my grandpa is old so i had no one literally, i never played with him soccer or anything never went out together the times we went out me and him together or even all of our family together are literally less than 20 times, even the few times he came to visit us he never did any activity with us or took us out as a family, he comes to see his siblings and sell some of the stuff he brings, goes to coffee to talk with the few people that still remember him since he been overseas for over 35 years even b4 marrying my mom which makes it worst considering he achieved nothing, he doesn’t have any friends here either lol he only have “work friends”, when he used to come to us during summer i remember my little brother begging him to take us out to the beach (20min away from our house) but he is just lazy, if we go we go with our uncles or neighbors. 

Anyways when i was 13 in the summer of 2017 exactly, i was in middle school second year, i had my friends like any other kid, school friends, neighborhood friends, 2 best friends etc, we were from a small town so everyone knows each other and people in our home country are so social so it was the norm, my sister had a lot of friends my brother had his few friends etc, we were stable socially, we were like any other kid around us, but that year, we went to visit him as a vacation, not only did he bring us just to stay in the house with him cuz he never takes us out and shows us around, but he randomly decided that we will stay and finish school there, tbh i wasn’t against it i was a kid and i was gonna live in “italy” which is exciting but my sister was against that and got mad but he did not care, we stayed anyways when our friends and everyone thought we were coming back lol 

So we started studying there and since we didn’t know we will stay we didn’t get ready we didn’t even take any Italian language lessons, it was a last minute decision, my first school year was hell, i was always quiet and in silence cuz i did not speak italian i used to get bullied by classmates, once one made fun of me for wearing a fake nike shoe even tho i was happy when i bought it cuz it was pretty and nobody really care about brands in our home country, ppl in my home country would’ve like that fake nike shoe even tho it doesn’t have the nike logo lol, or one girl asked me if i “wet my hair” cuz i was too dumb to understand “do you take a shower” the same girl convinced the kid in front of me to tell the teacher that i keep kicking him from behind, and he did lol, and obviously teacher confronted me and i wasn’t even able to express my self and tell her that they are lying lol one time the kid who used to “bully” me saw me with my phone when everyone does use it without letting the teacher see it and he told her and she took it lol, he didn’t really bully me in the full sense cuz i wouldn’t stay still and i would’ve defended myself since i used to fight in my home country but it was really hard knowing that people make fun of you verbally and you cant defend ur self, i remember that guy one time he got out of the buss and i was sitting next to the window, he was outside, he saw me and spat on the window where i was sitting and i literally couldn’t do anything about it, 
I started staying alone when i used to be outside hanging with friends, go from home to school then from school to home, same with my siblings, we go out together few times but just to buy something or go to a park, my brother was with me at the same school and fortunately his classmates seemed to be cool since he used to talk with them slowly and they helped him and included him even tho im sure some bullied him.

That year, we were living in the house that our dad was living in, which is literally for only one person, it had only one small room, one room that is the kitchen and the living room combined and a a bathroom, its called “monolocale” it was really small, so small that two people can’t live together comfortably, we were 5 living there lol, he was renting it from the government (they have them low cost for people that don’t make a lot of money) and since he didn’t pay and he also brought 5 ppl when that house was supposed to only have one person there, they decided to kick us, i remember them coming and kicking us out when my dad was convinced they will have empathy for us cuz we were kids lol anyways we got kicked out the house and had to live in a fucking a truck my dad had, we slept in mattresses in the back of the truck in a parking lot, we used to pee in a bucket and have water in other buckets to wash our faces/teeth before sleeping or when waking up, we used to go to the mcdonalds everyday to eat breakfast and maybe use the bathroom there, we ate pizza everyday, this lasted almost 9 months of being homeless and going to school in a country we just step our feet in when we were COMPLETELY FINE IN OUR HOME COUNTRY lol those 9 months weren’t all in the truck we also lived like 3 months with our uncle who has an italian wife and a 8 yo kid at the time, their house wasnt big but enough only for them tho, even tho my sister was with them from the begging cuz the truck doesnt fit 5 ppl lmao, we also stayed at this family that is from our home town and parents are friends of my parents, so we were literally disturbing every body lol, we weren’t able to find a house since my mom doesnt work and my dad works on his own not in a company and people here when they rent their homes they usually try to not rent them to immigrants since some of them dont pay and we have a bad image lol, the next summer of 2018 we didnt have a house either so my mom and siblings went back to our home country to visit and stay there the summer while i stayed with my dad at this family’s house, only the dad and his brother were in the house tho, i passed those 3 months of summer completely alone in the house i dont even go out only to buy some food, my dad works all day and same with the other men that were with us, i was 14, and completely isolated in the house, lol i wake up stay on the phone, cook white pasta and sleep this was my routine for 3 whole months i lost all of my social skills and confidence, i didn’t talk to my old friends in my home country cuz i was scared that they might ask me what im doing or how im living and i didn’t want to embarrass my self and tell them that i was homeless for 9 months thats why i didn’t call or answer their calls, 
I didnt even learn any italian since i wasnt speaking it lol and btw we this is no the second italian town we “live in” so we weren’t even stable we were from a place to place so it was impossible to know people and make friends when u not even “part of society”

The next year i was in my first high school year, it was 2019, it was already the 8/9th month of being homeless lol we finally got a house in another town, this town is so small it has like 4k person living there, nothing to do, i made some “friends” in my first high school year, but they weren’t really friends, i was acting like a clown trying to make them laugh hoping they become my friends, but at least i wasn’t completely alone and they were talking to me and joking with me and i enjoyed having them as classmates lowkey but then i lose that year due to me not being serious and i had to redo it, i changed class and after that never heard from them again, i also made some friends in my new year but again never heard of them when the year finish but hey at least i was trying and i was actually learning the language and talk to ppl, but then covid hits, lock down, i change school and go to another town for school (school is in another town but i was still in the same small town living), covid lock down made me lose ALL the progress that i made i lost all my social skills and i forgot my Italian, and imagine changing school and having ur first year of ur new school online thru a pc, i made 0 friends in that year it was like my first year in italy, just quiet all the time with my mask on, i lost all my social skills and developed social anxiety my life was go school then home then school then home and i used to speak only in my house outside the house i had no one to speak to, i studied with the same classmates for 4 years and only started becoming normal again and actually have what is close to a conversation in italian only during the end of the 3rd year and 4th year, and it was because i went to my home country after 6 years of not going and reconnecting with my cousins and 2 old friends that remember me cuz obviously if u dont show ur existence in 6 years ppl will get over u so now i dont even have friends even in my home country lol, this 1 month vacation kinda healed my social skills a bit tho, but still had no friends, it was only in 2023/24 that i made 3 friends i knew at the gym, and it was only last year that i stared going out with them on weekends but i still feel like i dont have friends it still feel as if im alone, literally since i was 13 till 19/20, for 6/7 years of my teen years never have i had fun or had any friend or did anything remarkable and i can remember and be proud of, 7 years of being alone, completely alone, go from school to home and from home to school, 7 years of my best years wasted, i am now a boring person with no personality, even tho im healing and even tho if u talk to me we will have a normal conversation and you would NEVER guess that i have no friends, people already have their friend groups and i am an outsider who was always quiet and weird, so i dont think ill ever be to have a normal social life, i talk with people at the gym and we are friends and go out sometimes, i made some friends at work and we went to eat, i talk to almost everyone at work, yet i have no friends and no deep connections all feel like superficial connections, it was not my choice im not actually weird or anything, i just didnt find stability to express my self, imagine if when i came here i had a house and lived a normal life, imagine if my dad signed me into to play sport or anything to get into the community, my life wouldve been so different, 

Same with my siblings in all of these 7 years they lived from school to home and from home to school they never go hang with other people or have any friends, i never saw my sister go out during weekends, or during evenings our lifes are so depressing and im sure they hate their lifes too, its like as if we dont deserve to exist, its like everything is against us, i feel so sorry for them, my brother is a fun guy, but he found himself in this situation and he was completely alone too, he is still alone, i hate myself for making these 2 friends at the gym cuz they be calling me sometimes to play video games and i dont want to talk to them in front of my siblings to avoid remembering them, i feel so sorry for my sister, she found her self in the streets and was also alone for these 7 years and is still alone,  i wish our lives were normal and we never came to our dad, this is really so depressing


Thanks for reading, idk if its me that is weird and bad at social interactions and making excuses for not being able to make friends and build a social life even tho i was in italy for 8 years or is it really not my fault, if u have any questions ask me",1,1744730265.0,lonely,3,1.0,False

“Why haven’t you answered my texts?”  
“I don’t know.” She is beautiful. Her hair moves in the icy breeze. It’s blonder then I recall. “Have you changed your hair?”  
She shakes her head. She’s not going to answer that question. I realize that she never answers any question that she doesn’t want to. She get answers to questions.  
  
*How is it I never saw that before?*

“I forgot about that cup.” She points to my frog cup.  
I feel my face blush. How will I explain this silly game I play daily with a man who doesn’t know my name?  
“Yeah, I don’t …” I turn back towards my door but then I stop and turn back. “What do you want Juliet?”  
“Let’s walk.” She says and loops her arm through mine. “I need a latte.”  
For a few steps she is quiet and then she starts. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what I was thinking. Jason is such a child. He doesn’t know how to be .. “ She smiles into my face. “He’s not you, is what I’m saying.” Juliet squeezes my arm. “I’m hoping we can put all this behind us.”  
I feel myself nodding my head. I can’t really think as she chatters away. We pull up next to Slappys and her face slips into puzzlement. “What’s here?”  
“I get my coffee here now.”  
“Why..” she looks askance at the bar door. “Let’s go to Starbucks. I’ll buy.”  
“No.” I plant my feet.  
“Honey.” Her face hardens. “Don’t be stubborn.”  
I leave her on the sidewalk and go into the bar. Stavros slaps his newspaper on the bar and looks past me at Juliet as she peeks into the bar.  
I don’t say anything as I hear the door slam shut. I know that she has not come into the bar. She’s still out there. Outside.  
“I’d like to buy the bar a drink” I say impulsively.  
The half dead men at the bar suddenly come awake.  
Stavros looks at me for a second, giving me a chance to change my mind. His eyes flit back to the closed door where my former girlfriend is tapping her foot on the pavement.

1jzudti,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jzudti/stavros_and_me_continued/,Stavros and Me - continued,"Stavros was behind the bar when I walked in. He was leaning over his newspaper mumbling to himself. The two old guys were in their same spots, moldering.

“Coffee” I smiled.

Stavros grunted then turned to the bar and repeated the same actions as he had before. I noted the stack of Styrofoam cups hadn’t seemed to have dropped any since yesterday. I might very well be the only coffee customer he has.  Which made me marvel at the enormous reserve of cups the man has next to his coffee machine. Had some smooth talking salesman come in here sometime in the last decade and convinced Stavros that he needed two thousand Styrofoam cups vouchsafed against the day he would be called upon to sell ten gallons of coffee?

“Ten cents.” He snarled.

“Ten cents?” I asked.

“Ten cents.”

“It was fifty-five cents yesterday.” This man was playing with me.

“Today – ten cents.” He leveled his eyes at me, daring me to argue with him again.

“Ok.” I said digging a dime from my pocket. “See you tomorrow.”

One of the old men sang “Tomorrow, tomorrow – I love you …” his voice trailed off. He’d either forgot the words or lost interest.

The next day Stavros and I exchanged coffee for money.

“Fifty-five cents.” He said.

I smiled and pulled three quarters from my pocket. His eyes were drawn to the coins as I dropped them on the bar. “Keep the change.”

I was stepping through the door when I heard him say. “Bah”

The next few days were dark. I didn’t go out for coffee. Juliet had texted me. She thought we should talk. I ignored the texts and stayed in bed.

Sunday, I went for a walk and stood outside Slappys for ten minutes before walking back home. I had been by there the night before and there was music playing and I could smell hamburgers frying. The bar did OK for itself I guess. I wanted to go in but I didn’t.

Monday morning I woke up and made myself get out of bed. I had to sign in today and take some calls. Last week’s funk had hurt my numbers and I needed the income. So I went down to Slappys and got some coffee.

Stavros slid the cup in front of me and said. “Thirty five cents.”

“Thirty five, huh?  Your prices sure fluctuate a lot.”

“What is this fluctuate?” heaskedslyly. I didn’t take the bait. For all I knew the man was a college professor.

“How much was this coffee yesterday?”

“You weren’t here yesterday.” He shrugged.

I pulled two quarters from my pocket and asked. “How much will this coffee cost tomorrow?

Stavros eyed the quarters and said. “I am not sure. Better you should come in tomorrow and we will find out together.”

I stopped the shenanigans with the money and decided to see what I could do to bring Stavros into present times. I was feeling bad about the Styrofoam cups accumulating in my apartment. I found a plastic travel mug that Juliet had given me in the back of a kitchen cabinet. It had a frog on the front of it and it said “Pucker up – I might be your Prince!”  
I took that with me the next day and sat it on the bar. Stavros looked at it briefly and then turned to the bar, took down a Styrofoam cup and filled it with coffee.

  
“No.” I said. I wanted you to put my coffee in this cup. I spun it so he could see the frog.  
Stavros picked it up and then showed it to the guys at the bar. They squinted at it and then chuckled. Stavros put it back on the bar and then handed me my coffee.

“Fifty-five cents.”

Now I had two stupid cups – I took the top off the frog cup and then took the top off my Styrofoam cup. I poured my coffee into the frog cup and then pushed the Styrofoam cup back across the bar. “Now you can recycle that cup.”  
Stavros grunted, took the cup and its top and tossed it into a trash bin under the bar.

“Fifty-five cents.”

Each day I walked into Slappys with my plastic frog cup and walked out with coffee in that cup and an empty Styrofoam cup.

Stavros doesn’t recycle.

Once a week I take my Styrofoam cups into the Starbucks. They have a very nice recycle setup in the lobby. The irony of this does not escape me.

1jzudre,https://i.redd.it/qvml9txxl0ve1.png,How does chemical hair dye work?,"*You are seeing this post for a reason. You know that feeling when you're binge-watching your favorite sitcom even though you should be sleeping? That's your hair right now, begging you to stop the dye cycle.*

I understand that greys are often unstoppable. I know the last time you saw yourself with your natural hair color was over a decade ago. I recognize that whether you choose to go blonder, darker, or redder is a reflection of your personality, and I absolutely agree with you. Go ahead and embrace those shades, but please stop the toxic cycle of breakage, frizz, thinning, and scalp irritation, and yes, your hair is indeed thinning.

**How does chemical hair dye work?** Most **chemical dyes** contain bleaching agents such as ammonia and/or peroxide. Their role is to damage the outermost layer of the hair strand, creating openings in the hair shaft for the chemical color to penetrate and remain stuck inside as a permanent dye. In simple terms, this process breaks down your hair, leading you into a cycle of trying to fix the breakage. Unfortunately, this is often impossible to the extent we desire. Plus, after 3 to 4 weeks, you’ll be dyeing it again, which will cause even more permanent damage, making your hair weaker, and rougher, and depriving it of its curl. 

In case you’re still wondering, ""Is box dye bad for your hair?"" Short answer: Yep, it's about as good for your hair as those low-rise jeans were for our dignity. It's like giving your hair a permanent bad hair day, every single time you dye! 

On the flip side, we have natural dyes, which have been used for centuries, and color hair by coating the hair shaft. Options like **Henna**, Cassia, Indigo, Coffee, Tea, Chamomile, Turmeric, and Amla all share a common trait: they color and nourish your hair.

For instance, Henna does not penetrate the hair shaft like synthetic dyes. Instead, it coats the hair with a protective layer, preventing damage and adding a lustrous shine. The main coloring component of henna, **lawsone**, is a natural dye with a low allergic potential. This makes it a safer and gentler option for those with sensitive scalps or allergies to chemical dyes. When applied, Henna thickens the hair and sticks as a semi-permanent color. The next application again does the same and results in increase in strength and shine in your hair.

Henna can help strengthen hair, reduce **hair loss**, and promote **hair growth**. It can also add volume and body to fine hair. Additionally, henna can help to balance the pH of your scalp, leading to healthier hair and a reduced risk of dandruff.

I know when you read the word “**Henna**”, you pictured **Ginger Spice**. But believe me when I say, Henna can give you a range of shades from strawberry blonde, all the way to raven black. I’ll leave you with that thought.

So, are you ready to break up with box dye and start a healthier hair relationship? Drop a comment and tell me what you’re most worried about.",1,1744729983.0,u_HairsTruly,0,1.0,False

1jzucih,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jzucih/stavros_and_me/,Stavros and Me,"

I quit drinking coffee at some point in my life. I don’t really know why but I started up again a month or so ago. There are two Starbucks on my block. Yeah, two. Every morning, before I stopped drinking the stuff, I would go downstairs, three flights down and walk down to the one that is on my side of the street. It’s further than the other one but you have to cross the street to get to that one so I always used the one I’m talking about. They got used to me coming in there and they would even put Juliet’s name on her Venti Soy milk carmaletto latte even though she never actually set foot in the place. I guess I told them her name at some time and so they sharpied ‘Juliet’ on her drink.

Armed with her drink and mine I would go back to the apartment and wake her up in time to get to her job downtown. She liked to get up at 7:45 so she could shower and catch the 8:25 train. After she was gone I would get my shower and start taking calls. I’m a help desk guy – freelance sort of. I have to take two hundred calls a week to keep my gig and I usually get those under my belt by Wednesday morning. Everything else is gravy. Juliet was less than enthusiastic about my career but she stayed quiet most of the time about it. We were at a party a few months ago and she said I was a telephone sex worker. To be fair she’d had a couple of glasses of wine on an empty stomach so she probably didn’t even know what she’d said. I think that that party might be where she and Jason got started. I don’t know.

So like I said, I just got started drinking coffee again, but I don’t get it at either of the Starbucks on my block. I go to a bar named Slappys. Slappys is between my apartment and the Starbucks I used to go to. One morning I just woke up and decided I wanted a cup of coffee. I might have been dreaming of Juliet – yeah I think I was. She and I were looking at a Sharper Image catalog and considering whether to buy a Swedish coffee brewer. It was carved out of a block of Norwegian porcelain. Who knew that was a thing anyways? It cost $595. I was getting my credit card out when I woke up with a start and found myself craving coffee.

I was surprised to find it had turned cold and was snowing lightly as I started walking towards the Starbucks. I hadn’t put much on except my sweatpants and a pullover sweater. Slappys’ bar door banged open just before I reached it and a delivery man pushed a two wheeled cart out across my path. I pulled up short and for some reason turned into the bar.  It was an odd feeling, a real throwback like the kind of bar my Dad and I went to looking for my Uncle Sal. Uncle Sal would go on a bender every couple of months and it was my Dad’s job to track him down and deliver him back to Aunt Sharmane. Ma always made me go with him.  My job, I finally figured out, was to be with Dad so he and Uncle Sal wouldn’t get even drunker once they found each other.

There were three guys sitting at the bar. Two right next to each other, hunched over staring into short glasses of beer. Empty shot glasses stood in front of each man. They each had a bar towel draped around their necks.  The third guy was reading a newspaper and was smoking a cigarette. This surprised me since a recent state law had been passed outlawing this. I guess maybe they didn’t know about the law here in Slappys.  The guy with the cigarette stood up slowly and folded his newspaper under his arm as he walked behind the bar.

“What’ll it be?” His voice was thick and gravely. I was pretty sure he was Eastern European.

*Bartender,* I thought. “Do you have coffee?”

He turned to the back of the bar and pulled a Styrofoam cup off a big stack of cups next to an ancient Bunn double burner.  He then took a decanter from the Bunn and poured steaming hot coffee into the cup. Finally he grabbed a flimsy plastic lid from somewhere back there and slapped it over the top of the cup.

“Fifty-five cents.” He growled.

I considered asking for cream and a Sweet and Low but though better of it when one of the two patrons opened his mouth and belched. Instead I took a dollar bill out of my sweatpants and told him to keep the change.

I and my coffee were nearly out the door when I heard one of the bar flies call him ‘Stavros.’ I considered throwing the coffee into the nearest trash can and continuing on to Starbucks but then thought better of it. What if upon seeing me they make Juliet’s drink? *They don’t know .. they don’t know what?* I ask myself. They don’t know what happened. Shit neither did I really. No, I had my coffee. Stavros made it and poured it out for me. So I was set. I returned to my apartment and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was pretty good. It had a good aroma and dusky taste. Black. I hadn’t drank a coffee black since I was in college.

The next morning I woke up and wanted coffee again. No dream of Juliet this time, just a desire for coffee. I looked out the window and noted the weather before heading out. I put a thicker coat on and grabbed my gloves.

I'm sorry for the long post in advance.

I used to be a really good student in my first year, I finished all my exams on time and with high grades. At the time, I used to live with a roommate who also attended med school, and I even had better grades than her. I don't recall having any like anxiety or any similar issues at the time, while my roommate suffered with anxiety and she would like get nauseous and throw up before our exams (something I never had).

I tried to help her, support her and even got her different types of calming tea and plant-based pills. In the middle of our 1st year, fisrt wave of COVID hit and I felt lost. I thought it's going to be a short term thing, so I kept going with my routine and studied hard for my exams. When the exams were postponed and pandemic didn't seem to settle down at all, I started to panic a little. 

Nevertheless, I managed to pass all my exams with pretty good grades except for Anatomy. I had to take my practical in June and it was very hot summer at the time and we were supposed to wear masks and gloves to the exam etc. I was also very nervous and I started to feel like I'm losing myself. I studied a lot for that exam,but when I came into the examination room, my head started to spin, I couldn't breathe, and mask somehow made it worse and I wasn't even allowed to take it off. 

I got up when my professor called me out. My head kept spinning and in the moment, I couldn't see the professor or anything as my vision started to shrink. I moved away from the table to sit, and everyone was staring at me. I felt so scared that I'm going to faint in front of everyone so I tried to help myself, no one really got close to help me. Professor ordered one student to take me to the toilet to wash my face. 

Well, I won't go into any more details, but summary: I left the examination room, didn't take the exam, I didn't feel alright in the next month or so. It culminated when my roommate kept getting frustrated with me and herself for whatever reasons, and I crashed out because I felt like I was going crazy. My parents picked me up and I left our apartment, they urged me to move awayfrom her(idk why they didn't like my roommate).

They asked me do I want to keep living with her and I wasn't even in the right place mentally to answer that question (I kept fainting randomly), and I said like no. And they encouraged me to move away without a word. I felt guilty for doing that but I didn't even do anything about it. My parents found me a new apartment and started to live alone. 2020, 2021, 2022 - I spent being hopelessly depressed (I think, I wasn't diagnosed), but I didn't do anything to help myself instead of loathe in my despair. 

I didn't even know what was happening to me. My parents were criticizing me for not taking exams, for avoiding college stuff even though my uni was still technically in quarantine due to COVID. I failed my 2nd year. I repeated the year, but still didn't get any work done. My dad took me to psychiatrist in the summer of 2022. He told me I'm just severely anxious and the only way to get through that is to confront my fears. He also put me on Xanax. 

After I started taking Xanax, my condition improved. I slept a lot and I was drowsy during the day. I got sick, too, like my immune system dropped suddenly. I stopped taking Xanax on my own, and didn't go to check-up. Finally, I got some mental clarity and I took anatomy exam again and passed it with very good grade. 

Then somehow, I got through into the third year. I felt grateful at that time and I tried really hard to finish my leftover exams while also juggling the third year. But even though I was happy to go to college again (pandemic was finally over in late 2022/2023), I still felt nauseous when going to my lectures. I felt like I'm disgusting and don't belong there. I felt like everyone is so happy and I'm just shit, and I just wished to go home and lay down. 

I don't know if that was stress or what, but I felt like I was worthless. I also felt everyone is judging me. I avoided my colleagues who invited me for coffee etc. I managed to pass half of the exams in my third year and half of my leftover exams. I failed third year too(because I had 5 unfinished exams left). 

After that happened, I swore that I would do my best and try to clear out leftover exams and pass into the fourth year. I took Physiology and Neuroanatomy practical exam. I managed to pass Physio practicals and Test 2 (Renal Physiology) and Neuro practical which took me a month to learn (Head and Neck + Bones). My mom criticized me that I didn't do enough, that I wasn't trying enough, and I started to feel like that, too. 

I felt like I was stupid. She was dissapointed that I didn't take Neuro oral exam right after and why didn't I study for it, but I just had so much trouble understanding the nervous system by myself, especially cause I didn't attend lectures during covid. I felt so unsuccessful, that I stopped trying again and fell into the slump. 

Instead of studying hard for June/July exams, I didn't do anything and had another crashout when summer came. My parents, instead of encouraging me to study and try hard for August/September final exam period before new academic year starts, they told me like ""you're gonna fail again I can see it"" while it was still June. And I did, my mental state was/is fragile that I just take their words as my reality. 

That year (2024) in August, I started to think a bit differently. I finally told myself that I can't live how my parents tell me to, and I finally realized that I need to fix myself. First, I contacted my ex roommate (Despite everything, that girl managed to get through whole med school year after year and is now graduating, while I'm still stuck on third year). I wanted to apologize to her for leaving without the word, 

I felt like guilt was eating me alive. Fortunitely, she accepted my invitation and apology. We went out and I apologized. We didn't hang out again after our encounter, but I felt weight got partly lifted from my shoulders and it was case closed. I didn't tell my mom about it as she didn't want me to do it when I mentioned it to her before. 

I promised to myself that I would make my life better, for MYSELF. I started taking lectures of Neuroanatomy in October. I also took consultations from my professor ( I felt great anxiety doing 1 on 1 consultation but it was kinda helpful).  I also didn't feel like an imposter during the lectured. I was actually paying attention and feeling good about it. That was the period I felt the best about myself. 

But, I was still wondering how could I improve myself to get disciplined and study daily like before. I managed to pass Pharmacology Tests and Practicals in January now, and I had to take oral exam on CNS(without ANS) and Hormone Pharmacology in April. But, even though I am trying and my mental state improved a lot, I still struggle with certain things. 

My current problems are:

1. I can't get enough sleep. I struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep. I had a period where I could fall asleep earlier due to melatonin supplements, but it was pretty much short lived and I couldn't make myself have fixed sleep schedule naturally. For example, today I slept from 2:00AM-11:30AM. Yesterday, I slept from 11:30PM-9:30AM. The day before, I couldn't sleep till 3:00AM and woke up at 10:00AM. It constantly fluctuates like that. I get strong headaches, too, right after waking up. Ibuprofen doesn't help them go away.

2. I have no will or motivation to study, or keep up with tasks. I make a plan, and then when I want to follow it, I just can't. I feel like I'm gonna cry because it's so frustrating. It's not even that I don't like the material I'm studying, because I do. I find it interesting but I just can't make myself to do it. Or, I start doing it, and I get mental fatigue very quickly. (I also realized this is tied to my sleep schedule, when I'm well rested I don't have problems in motivation) 

3. I don't have friends aside from my boyfriend and brother and his gf. 

4. I live alone, and I don't have any hobbies. My day consists of getting up, having coffee and then sitting in front of my pc/phone. I don't have a will to go out and walk etc, except if my boyfriend drags me out of the house. 

5. Part of me still feels like a failure. 

6. I am religious and I feel guilty for not being able to stick with the prayers consistently, too. 

I really want to get better, I know there isn't a quick fix. But it's April now and I need to prepare for exams coming up in June/July.  I don't have time to waste, but I also don't want to feel dread when I start studying, like, that feeling where I get nauseous and feel like  life isn't worth living. I have to prep Neuroanatomy oral exam and Pharma oral exam that I already mentioned. 

I also have whole Pathology, but I can leave that for August/September, after June/July exams, so I don't feel overwhelmed. I sometimes feel like I'm just making stuff  up in my own head. I don't know what's my reality. Am I just lazy, or there is an underlying problem. My priority is to fix my mental state, so please if you have any tips how to do so help me. And how to stay productive through that. 

I forgot to mention, I started to visit gym few days a week, but I am striving to go 5 times a week. It helped with mental clarity, but sometimes it's short lived or my mind is sometimes stronger than the physical exhaustion.  

Please, if you have any advice for me and if you went through something similar, write it down. What helped you etc. And thank you for reading this far. 

Note: English is not my first language, so I'm sorry if some sentences sound confusing. Also, I don't attend medical school in America, but in one small country in Europe. Medical school is 6 years long here, before we can become general practicioner and choose our specialty.

I'll preface by saying I don't regret getting married at all. I love my wife and the life we're building together. But lately I've been having some kind of difficult feelings.

I'm feeling sort of nostalgic and wistful, but for a life I never had. Like I missed out on a lot by meeting my wife and getting married so young.

I recently met a girl that works at one of my favorite local coffee shops, and it made me imagine an alternate reality where I was a single 24 year old with the ability to ask a girl out, instead of a married one with more responsibilities than hours in the day.

I do like that girl, but I don't really know her. It isn't about her specifically, although she does look and sound nearly identical to my celebrity crush. It's more about the missed opportunity to meet people and have casual relationships and find myself as a person, rather than my wife and I learning who we are as a couple for most of our young-adult lives.

Again, I have no regrets with my marriage, and I would never cheat on my wife. I truly think we're happy and are unlikely to ever separate. I just sometimes wish we'd met a few years later so I could've explored the world as a single man for a while.

How Coffee Protects Your Liver: The Scientific Evidence

Coffee contains powerful compounds that interact positively with liver function. Research has consistently demonstrated that regular coffee consumption can provide remarkable protective effects against various liver diseases. Let's explore the specific ways coffee benefits liver health.

Antioxidant Power: Fighting Liver Damage

Coffee is packed with antioxidants that combat cellular damage and reduce inflammation. These powerful compounds include:

- Chlorogenic acid
- Caffeic acid
- Melanoidins
- Trigonelline

These antioxidants help neutralize harmful free radicals and protect liver cells from oxidative stress. By reducing inflammation, coffee can potentially slow down liver disease progression.

Reducing Risk of Liver Disease

Multiple studies have shown that coffee consumption can significantly lower the risk of several liver conditions:

1. Liver Cirrhosis
Regular coffee drinkers have up to a **60% reduced risk** of developing liver cirrhosis, a severe condition characterized by scarring of the liver tissue.

2. Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Research indicates that drinking 2-3 cups of coffee daily can reduce liver cancer risk by approximately 40%.

3. Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
Coffee consumption has been linked to decreased fat accumulation in the liver, potentially mitigating the progression of fatty liver disease.

Metabolic Mechanisms of Liver Protection

How exactly does coffee provide these incredible benefits? The liver metabolizes coffee's compounds in unique ways:

- Caffeine stimulates metabolism
- Polyphenols reduce inflammation
- Compounds enhance insulin sensitivity
- Promote healthy liver enzyme levels

Coffee and Liver Enzyme Regulation

Scientific studies have consistently demonstrated coffee's ability to help regulate liver enzymes. Elevated liver enzymes often indicate potential liver damage, and coffee consumption has been associated with:

- Lowered ALT levels
- Reduced AST markers
- Improved overall liver function

Recommended Coffee Consumption for Liver Health

While coffee offers substantial benefits, moderation is key. Health experts recommend:

- 3-4 cups daily for optimal liver protection
- Preferably black coffee or with minimal additives
- Organic, high-quality beans

Special Considerations for Coffee and Liver Health

Not all coffee provides equal benefits. Consider these factors:

- Choose filtered coffee over unfiltered
- Avoid excessive sugar and cream
- Limit alcohol consumption
- Maintain a balanced diet

Potential Limitations and Considerations

While promising, coffee isn't a cure-all. Individuals with specific health conditions should consult healthcare professionals about coffee consumption.

Conclusion

Coffee emerges as a surprising and powerful ally in liver health, offering multiple protective mechanisms through its complex biochemical composition. From reducing inflammation to potentially preventing serious liver diseases, your daily cup of joe does far more than provide an energy boost. By understanding and leveraging coffee's remarkable properties, individuals can take proactive steps toward maintaining optimal liver function. Remember, while coffee shows tremendous promise, it should complement - not replace - a healthy lifestyle, balanced diet, and regular medical check-ups.",1,1744729545.0,liverhealth1,0,1.0,False

* Mercer Island School Board Passes Immigration Enforcement Resolution, Debates Hi-Cap Data and Public Input Policy: At its April 8 special meeting, the Mercer Island School Board unanimously passed Resolution No. 739 affirming protections for student safety, privacy, and equal access to education regardless of immigration status. The resolution, revised by Directors Glowitz and Martinez, incorporates OSPI guidance and state law. The board also revisited internal disagreement over Highly Capable (Hi-Cap) student growth data, with Glowitz defending his prior statements and Lurie rejecting his interpretation, calling for better analysis tools. Additionally, board members debated changes to the public comment policy, exploring speaker time limits and linkage sessions to better manage lengthy meetings while still allowing for meaningful community engagement. A trial time-limit policy will be tested at the next meeting, with further review in May.[(info)](https://www.mi-reporter.com/news/mi-school-board-passes-resolution-on-immigration-enforcement/?utm_source=seastside.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=seastside-newsletter-65)
* Mercer Island Residents Stage Weekly Protest Against Federal Government Actions: Mercer Island resident Gene Robertson has organized weekly peaceful protests at the intersection of Island Crest Way and Southeast 40th Street to oppose what she views as the dismantling of the U.S. government under President Trump and Elon Musk. Since March 16, the gatherings have grown from a handful to about 50 participants, holding signs with messages like “Resist MAGA” and “Save Democracy.” Supporters cite government funding cuts and democratic backsliding as motivations. The group has received mostly positive public responses and recently joined larger protests in Seattle and Bellevue. Robertson and fellow protesters, including Councilmember Craig Reynolds, say the movement fosters unity and hope amid federal concerns.[(info)](https://www.mi-reporter.com/news/mi-protesters-voice-concerns-about-federal-government/?utm_source=seastside.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=seastside-newsletter-65)

1jzu5wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1jzu5wc/i_need_advice_how_to_get_better_mentally_and_pass/,I need advice how to get better mentally and pass my exams,"I am third year medical student, and I'm kinda stuck, not sure what my problem really is, so I'll try to explain my situation in detail. I'm sorry for the long post in advance.

I used to be a really good student in my first year, I finished all my exams on time and with high grades. At the time, I used to live with a roommate who also attended med school, and I even had better grades than her. I don't recall having any like anxiety or any similar issues at the time, while my roommate suffered with anxiety and she would like get nauseous and throw up before our exams (something I never had).

I tried to help her, support her and even got her different types of calming tea and plant-based pills. In the middle of our 1st year, first wave of COVID hit and I felt lost. I thought it's going to be a short term thing, so I kept going with my routine and studied hard for my exams. When the exams were postponed and pandemic didn't seem to settle down at all, I started to panic a little.

Nevertheless, I managed to pass all my exams with pretty good grades except for Anatomy. I had to take my practical in June and it was very hot summer at the time and we were supposed to wear masks and gloves to the exam etc. I was also very nervous and I started to feel like I'm losing myself. I studied a lot for that exam,but when I came into the examination room, my head started to spin, I couldn't breathe, and mask somehow made it worse and I wasn't even allowed to take it off.

I got up when my professor called me out. My head kept spinning and in the moment, I couldn't see the professor or anything as my vision started to shrink. I moved away from the table to sit, and everyone was staring at me. I felt so scared that I'm going to faint in front of everyone so I tried to help myself, no one really got close to help me. Professor ordered one student to take me to the toilet to wash my face.

Well, I won't go into any more details, but summary: I left the examination room, didn't take the exam, I didn't feel alright in the next month or so. It culminated when my roommate kept getting frustrated with me and herself for whatever reasons, and I crashed out because I felt like I was going crazy. My parents picked me up and I left our apartment, they urged me to move awayfrom her(idk why they didn't like my roommate).

They asked me do I want to keep living with her and I wasn't even in the right place mentally to answer that question (I kept fainting randomly), and I said no. They encouraged me to move away from her without a word. I felt guilty for doing that but I didn't even do anything about it. My parents found me a new apartment and I started to live alone. 2020, 2021, 2022 - I spent being hopelessly depressed (I think, I wasn't diagnosed), but I didn't do anything to help myself instead of loathe in my despair.

I didn't even know what was happening to me. My parents were criticizing me for not taking exams, for avoiding college stuff even though my uni was still technically in quarantine due to COVID. I failed my 2nd year. I repeated the year, but still didn't get any work done. My dad took me to psychiatrist in the summer of 2022. He told me I'm just severely anxious and the only way to get through that is to confront my fears. He also put me on Xanax.

After I started taking Xanax, my condition improved. I slept a lot and I was drowsy during the day. I got sick, too, like my immune system dropped suddenly. I stopped taking Xanax on my own, and didn't go to check-up. Finally, I got some mental clarity and I took anatomy exam again and passed it with very good grade.

Then somehow, I got through into the third year. I felt grateful at that time and I tried really hard to finish my leftover exams while also juggling the third year. But even though I was happy to go to college again (pandemic was finally over in late 2022/2023), I still felt nauseous when going to my lectures. I felt like I'm disgusting and don't belong there. I felt like everyone is so happy and I'm just shit, and I just wished to go home and lay down.

I don't know if that was stress or what, but I felt like I was worthless. I also felt everyone is judging me. I avoided my colleagues who invited me for coffee etc. I managed to pass half of the exams in my third year and half of my leftover exams. I failed third year too(because I had 5 unfinished exams left).

After that happened, I swore that I would do my best and try to clear out leftover exams and pass into the fourth year. I took Physiology and Neuroanatomy practical exam. I managed to pass Physio practicals and Test 2 (Renal Physiology) and Neuro practical which took me a month to learn (Head and Neck + Bones). My mom criticized me that I didn't do enough, that I wasn't trying enough, and I started to feel like that, too.

I felt like I was stupid. She was dissapointed that I didn't take Neuro oral exam right after and why didn't I study for it, but I just had so much trouble understanding the nervous system by myself, especially cause I didn't attend lectures during covid. I felt so unsuccessful, that I stopped trying again and fell into the slump.

Instead of studying hard for June/July exams, I didn't do anything and had another crashout when summer came. My parents, instead of encouraging me to study and try hard for August/September final exam period before new academic year starts, they told me like ""you're gonna fail again I can see it"" while it was still June. And I did, my mental state was/is fragile that I just take their words as my reality.

That year (2024) in August, I started to think a bit differently. I finally told myself that I can't live how my parents tell me to, and I finally realized that I need to fix myself. First, I contacted my ex roommate (Despite everything, that girl managed to get through whole med school year after year and is now graduating, while I'm still stuck on third year). I wanted to apologize to her for leaving without the word,

I felt like guilt was eating me alive. Fortunitely, she accepted my invitation and apology. We went out and I apologized. We didn't hang out again after our encounter, but I felt weight got partly lifted from my shoulders and it was case closed. I didn't tell my mom about it as she didn't want me to do it when I mentioned it to her before.

I promised to myself that I would make my life better, for MYSELF. I started taking lectures of Neuroanatomy in October. I also took consultations from my professor ( I felt great anxiety doing 1 on 1 consultation but it was kinda helpful).  I also didn't feel like an imposter during the lectures. I was actually paying attention and feeling good about it. That was the period I felt the best about myself.

But, I was still wondering how could I improve myself to get disciplined and study daily like before. I managed to pass Pharmacology Tests and Practicals in January now, and I had to take oral exam on CNS(without ANS) and Hormone Pharmacology in April. But, even though I am trying and my mental state improved a lot, I still struggle with certain things.

My current problems are:

1. I can't get enough sleep. I struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep. I had a period where I could fall asleep earlier due to melatonin supplements, but it was pretty much short lived and I couldn't make myself have fixed sleep schedule naturally. For example, today I slept from 2:00AM-11:30AM. Yesterday, I slept from 11:30PM-9:30AM. The day before, I couldn't sleep till 3:00AM and woke up at 10:00AM. It constantly fluctuates like that. I get strong headaches, too, right after waking up. Ibuprofen doesn't help them go away.
2. I have no will or motivation to study, or keep up with tasks. I make a plan, and then when I want to follow it, I just can't. I feel like I'm gonna cry because it's so frustrating. It's not even that I don't like the material I'm studying, because I do. I find it interesting but I just can't make myself to do it. Or, I start doing it, and I get mental fatigue very quickly. (I also realized this is tied to my sleep schedule, when I'm well rested I don't have problems in motivation)
3. I don't have friends aside from my boyfriend and brother and his gf.
4. I live alone, and I don't have any hobbies. My day consists of getting up, having coffee and then sitting in front of my pc/phone. I don't have a will to go out and walk etc, except if my boyfriend drags me out of the house.
5. Part of me still feels like a failure.
6. I am religious and I feel guilty for not being able to stick with the prayers consistently, too.

I really want to get better, I know there isn't a quick fix. But it's April now and I need to prepare for exams coming up in June/July.  I don't have time to waste, but I also don't want to feel dread when I start studying, like, that feeling where I get nauseous and feel like  life isn't worth living. I have to prep Neuroanatomy oral exam and Pharma oral exam that I already mentioned.

I also have whole Pathology, but I can leave that for August/September, after June/July exams, so I don't feel overwhelmed. I sometimes feel like I'm just making stuff  up in my own head. I don't know what's my reality. Am I just lazy, or there is an underlying problem. My priority is to fix my mental state, so please if you have any tips how to do so help me. And how to stay productive through that.

I forgot to mention, I started to visit gym few days a week, but I am striving to go 5 times a week. It helped with mental clarity, but sometimes it's short lived or my mind is sometimes stronger than the physical exhaustion.

Please, if you have any advice for me and if you went through something similar, write it down. What helped you etc. And thank you for reading this far.

## What is ToravexTrader?

ToravexTrader is an online trading platform that offers both **automated** and **manual trading tools**. Think of it as your one-stop hub where you can trade **cryptocurrencies**, **stocks**, **forex**, and even **commodities** — all from a single dashboard. It’s designed to be beginner-friendly but also has features that more experienced traders would appreciate.

One of the key selling points of ToravexTrader is its use of **real-time data and smart analytics** to help users make informed trading decisions. It’s not just throwing charts at you — it actually tries to interpret market trends and serve up relevant alerts and suggestions. That’s a big plus if you’re not a spreadsheet wizard.

## Who Created ToravexTrader?

Here’s where things get a little vague. The exact creators of ToravexTrader aren’t publicly named — which is kinda common with platforms like this, especially in the crypto space. According to available info, it was developed by a group of financial tech experts and traders who wanted to create a **simplified but powerful** trading experience.

While the anonymity might raise a few eyebrows, it's worth noting that some other popular platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** followed a similar pattern when they launched. It doesn’t automatically mean it’s shady — but it’s something to be aware of.

### [🔥 Start Trading with ToravexTrader Today](https://tinyurl.com/2zrz8m66)
## How Does ToravexTrader Work?

ToravexTrader operates by connecting users with **market data, trading tools**, and **automated bots**. You can either place trades manually — using the charts, news, and analysis provided — or you can use the **autotrading feature**, which is basically a bot that places trades based on pre-set rules or signals.

Here’s how it breaks down:
- You create an account and fund it.
- You choose whether you want to trade manually or let the **algorithmic bot** do its thing.
- The platform uses **AI-driven strategies** to scan for opportunities in real time.
- You can set stop-losses, alerts, and customize your risk preferences.

The automation is optional, but it’s a huge draw for people who want to trade without being glued to their screens.

## ToravexTrader Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real — no platform is perfect. Here’s what stood out to me.

**Pros**:
- **Easy to use** interface, even if you’re new to trading.
- **Supports multiple markets** (crypto, stocks, forex).
- **Custom alerts** and risk management tools.
- **Automated trading option** with AI support.
- **Mobile-friendly** and works smoothly on both iOS and Android.
- **Demo account** to practice before risking real money.

**Cons**:
- **Lack of transparency** about the founders and regulation.
- **Minimum deposit** of $250 might be high for some beginners.
- **Customer support** is only available 5 days a week.
- **No advanced charting tools** for pro-level traders.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access ToravexTrader?

One of the things I really liked is the **device flexibility**. You can use ToravexTrader on:
- **Desktop browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Tablets**
- **Mobile phones** (iOS and Android)

There’s no dedicated mobile app yet (at least at the time of writing), but the **web interface is fully responsive** and works great on smaller screens. I’ve done trades on my phone while waiting in line for coffee — no lag, no weird formatting issues.

## ToravexTrader – Supported Countries

ToravexTrader is available in **most regions worldwide**, but there are a few exceptions:
- Not available in **the U.S.**, **North Korea**, and some **EU-restricted countries** due to regulatory hurdles.
- Fully accessible in places like Canada, Australia, South Africa, India, and the UK.

They don’t publish a full list of supported countries, but you’ll know if your region is blocked when you try to sign up.

## ToravexTrader – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where ToravexTrader punches above its weight. The **real-time data feeds and market scanners** are constantly updating, meaning you’re not stuck trading on stale info. It pulls from various sources and gives you trend alerts, price changes, and signals within seconds.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is **super clean and intuitive**. You won’t get lost in a maze of tabs. Everything is easy to access — from your portfolio and trade history to charts and asset lists. Perfect if you hate clunky UIs.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even without a dedicated app, the mobile version of the site is **surprisingly smooth**. You can fund your account, set alerts, and place trades directly from your phone. Very convenient for anyone who doesn’t want to be tied to a desk.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **price alerts, stop-losses, take-profits**, and even news-based triggers. These features help reduce risk and let you step away from the screen without missing crucial changes.

You’re not just limited to Bitcoin or a few stocks. ToravexTrader supports:
- **Cryptocurrencies** (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.)
- **Forex pairs**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities** like gold and oil

Being able to diversify from one platform is a game-changer.

## Is ToravexTrader a Scam?

From my experience and research? **No, it’s not a scam**, but it’s also not 100% transparent. It functions well, withdrawals work, and the tools do what they promise. But the lack of regulatory info and anonymous founders means you should still be cautious and **never trade more than you can afford to lose**.

That said, it performs similarly to other legit platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**, which have been around for a while.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on ToravexTrader?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms in this category. This gives you full access to the features, including the live market and auto-trading tools.

You can fund your account via:
- Credit/debit card
- Bank transfer
- Some crypto wallets (BTC, ETH)

### ToravexTrader Customer Support

Support is **available 24/5** via:
- **Live chat**
- **Email**

While they don’t have phone support, the response times on live chat were decent during my testing. I got replies within minutes during market hours. Just note that support is **unavailable on weekends**.

## How do you start trading on ToravexTrader?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account
Go to the official ToravexTrader site and fill in your name, email, and phone number. You’ll get a confirmation email to activate your account.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account
You’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff), then deposit a minimum of **$250** to get started.

### Step 3: Start Trading
Once funded, you can either go manual or activate the auto-trading bot. You can also explore the **demo account** to practice.

## How to Delete a ToravexTrader Account?

If you ever want to delete your account:

- They’ll guide you through the process.

Just make sure to withdraw your money first.

1jzu4oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1jzu4oi/need_advice_how_to_get_better_and_bring_back_my/,Need advice how to get better and bring back my old self,"I am third year medical student, and I'm kinda stuck, not sure what my problem really is, so I'll try to explain my situation in detail. I'm sorry for the long post in advance.

I used to be a really good student in my first year, I finished all my exams on time and with high grades. At the time, I used to live with a roommate who also attended med school, and I even had better grades than her. I don't recall having any like anxiety or any similar issues at the time, while my roommate suffered with anxiety and she would like get nauseous and throw up before our exams (something I never had).

I tried to help her, support her and even got her different types of calming tea and plant-based pills. In the middle of our 1st year, fisrt wave of COVID hit and I felt lost. I thought it's going to be a short term thing, so I kept going with my routine and studied hard for my exams. When the exams were postponed and pandemic didn't seem to settle down at all, I started to panic a little. 

Nevertheless, I managed to pass all my exams with pretty good grades except for Anatomy. I had to take my practical in June and it was very hot summer at the time and we were supposed to wear masks and gloves to the exam etc. I was also very nervous and I started to feel like I'm losing myself. I studied a lot for that exam,but when I came into the examination room, my head started to spin, I couldn't breathe, and mask somehow made it worse and I wasn't even allowed to take it off. 

I got up when my professor called me out. My head kept spinning and in the moment, I couldn't see the professor or anything as my vision started to shrink. I moved away from the table to sit, and everyone was staring at me. I felt so scared that I'm going to faint in front of everyone so I tried to help myself, no one really got close to help me. Professor ordered one student to take me to the toilet to wash my face. 

Well, I won't go into any more details, but summary: I left the examination room, didn't take the exam, I didn't feel alright in the next month or so. It culminated when my roommate kept getting frustrated with me and herself for whatever reasons, and I crashed out because I felt like I was going crazy. My parents picked me up and I left our apartment, they urged me to move awayfrom her(idk why they didn't like my roommate).

They asked me do I want to keep living with her and I wasn't even in the right place mentally to answer that question (I kept fainting randomly), and I said like no. And they encouraged me to move away without a word. I felt guilty for doing that but I didn't even do anything about it. My parents found me a new apartment and started to live alone. 2020, 2021, 2022 - I spent being hopelessly depressed (I think, I wasn't diagnosed), but I didn't do anything to help myself instead of loathe in my despair. 

I didn't even know what was happening to me. My parents were criticizing me for not taking exams, for avoiding college stuff even though my uni was still technically in quarantine due to COVID. I failed my 2nd year. I repeated the year, but still didn't get any work done. My dad took me to psychiatrist in the summer of 2022. He told me I'm just severely anxious and the only way to get through that is to confront my fears. He also put me on Xanax. 

After I started taking Xanax, my condition improved. I slept a lot and I was drowsy during the day. I got sick, too, like my immune system dropped suddenly. I stopped taking Xanax on my own, and didn't go to check-up. Finally, I got some mental clarity and I took anatomy exam again and passed it with very good grade. 

Then somehow, I got through into the third year. I felt grateful at that time and I tried really hard to finish my leftover exams while also juggling the third year. But even though I was happy to go to college again (pandemic was finally over in late 2022/2023), I still felt nauseous when going to my lectures. I felt like I'm disgusting and don't belong there. I felt like everyone is so happy and I'm just shit, and I just wished to go home and lay down. 

I don't know if that was stress or what, but I felt like I was worthless. I also felt everyone is judging me. I avoided my colleagues who invited me for coffee etc. I managed to pass half of the exams in my third year and half of my leftover exams. I failed third year too(because I had 5 unfinished exams left). 

After that happened, I swore that I would do my best and try to clear out leftover exams and pass into the fourth year. I took Physiology and Neuroanatomy practical exam. I managed to pass Physio practicals and Test 2 (Renal Physiology) and Neuro practical which took me a month to learn (Head and Neck + Bones). My mom criticized me that I didn't do enough, that I wasn't trying enough, and I started to feel like that, too. 

I felt like I was stupid. She was dissapointed that I didn't take Neuro oral exam right after and why didn't I study for it, but I just had so much trouble understanding the nervous system by myself, especially cause I didn't attend lectures during covid. I felt so unsuccessful, that I stopped trying again and fell into the slump. 

Instead of studying hard for June/July exams, I didn't do anything and had another crashout when summer came. My parents, instead of encouraging me to study and try hard for August/September final exam period before new academic year starts, they told me like ""you're gonna fail again I can see it"" while it was still June. And I did, my mental state was/is fragile that I just take their words as my reality. 

That year (2024) in August, I started to think a bit differently. I finally told myself that I can't live how my parents tell me to, and I finally realized that I need to fix myself. First, I contacted my ex roommate (Despite everything, that girl managed to get through whole med school year after year and is now graduating, while I'm still stuck on third year). I wanted to apologize to her for leaving without the word, 

I felt like guilt was eating me alive. Fortunitely, she accepted my invitation and apology. We went out and I apologized. We didn't hang out again after our encounter, but I felt weight got partly lifted from my shoulders and it was case closed. I didn't tell my mom about it as she didn't want me to do it when I mentioned it to her before. 

I promised to myself that I would make my life better, for MYSELF. I started taking lectures of Neuroanatomy in October. I also took consultations from my professor ( I felt great anxiety doing 1 on 1 consultation but it was kinda helpful).  I also didn't feel like an imposter during the lectured. I was actually paying attention and feeling good about it. That was the period I felt the best about myself. 

But, I was still wondering how could I improve myself to get disciplined and study daily like before. I managed to pass Pharmacology Tests and Practicals in January now, and I had to take oral exam on CNS(without ANS) and Hormone Pharmacology in April. But, even though I am trying and my mental state improved a lot, I still struggle with certain things. 

My current problems are:

1. I can't get enough sleep. I struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep. I had a period where I could fall asleep earlier due to melatonin supplements, but it was pretty much short lived and I couldn't make myself have fixed sleep schedule naturally. For example, today I slept from 2:00AM-11:30AM. Yesterday, I slept from 11:30PM-9:30AM. The day before, I couldn't sleep till 3:00AM and woke up at 10:00AM. It constantly fluctuates like that. I get strong headaches, too, right after waking up. Ibuprofen doesn't help them go away.

2. I have no will or motivation to study, or keep up with tasks. I make a plan, and then when I want to follow it, I just can't. I feel like I'm gonna cry because it's so frustrating. It's not even that I don't like the material I'm studying, because I do. I find it interesting but I just can't make myself to do it. Or, I start doing it, and I get mental fatigue very quickly. (I also realized this is tied to my sleep schedule, when I'm well rested I don't have problems in motivation) 

3. I don't have friends aside from my boyfriend and brother and his gf. 

4. I live alone, and I don't have any hobbies. My day consists of getting up, having coffee and then sitting in front of my pc/phone. I don't have a will to go out and walk etc, except if my boyfriend drags me out of the house. 

5. Part of me still feels like a failure. 

6. I am religious and I feel guilty for not being able to stick with the prayers consistently, too. 

I really want to get better, I know there isn't a quick fix. But it's April now and I need to prepare for exams coming up in June/July.  I don't have time to waste, but I also don't want to feel dread when I start studying, like, that feeling where I get nauseous and feel like  life isn't worth living. I have to prep Neuroanatomy oral exam and Pharma oral exam that I already mentioned. 

I also have whole Pathology, but I can leave that for August/September, after June/July exams, so I don't feel overwhelmed. I sometimes feel like I'm just making stuff  up in my own head. I don't know what's my reality. Am I just lazy, or there is an underlying problem. My priority is to fix my mental state, so please if you have any tips how to do so help me. And how to stay productive through that. 

I forgot to mention, I started to visit gym few days a week, but I am striving to go 5 times a week. It helped with mental clarity, but sometimes it's short lived or my mind is sometimes stronger than the physical exhaustion.  

Please, if you have any advice for me and if you went through something similar, write it down. What helped you etc. And thank you for reading this far. 

Note: English is not my first language, so I'm sorry if some sentences sound confusing. Also, I don't attend medical school in America, but in one small country in Europe. Medical school is 6 years long here, before we can become general practicioner and choose our specialty.

1jzu47w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1jzu47w/please_help_me_get_back_on_track_and_not_lose_my/,Please help me get back on track and not lose my faith,"Hi everyone,

I'm here because I feel like I’m at a crossroads - caught between so many incredible signs and synchronicities, but starting to lose faith because of how long things are taking.

Let me tell you my story.

Last year I was in the hiring process for a job at a company I absolutely loved. I didn’t get the job in the end because they went with someone who had already worked with them. Fast forward to a few months ago, I decided I wanted to manifest this job again. I just knew I was meant to work there.

At first, I started scripting - writing affirmations and trying to stick to techniques - but something felt off. I wasn’t feeling it. Then one day, after reading something in this very subreddit, something just clicked. I shifted. I began to focus on gratitude. I stopped doing things and started being in the feeling. I can't even describe exactly what I did - it was more of a deep internal shift.

And then the signs started.

I started seeing the symbol that represents the company's logo everywhere. I mean everywhere: on TV, social media, emojis, random usernames on TikTok. It’s a very specific object - definitely not a common one - and yet it was showing up constantly, especially whenever I had doubts.

One of the wildest moments: I walked by a newsstand and saw a magazine with an ad for the company on it, propped up on a stand with a spotlight. I've never seen ads for this company before, and especially not in my country (it’s not even based here). That moment gave me chills.

A month into my manifestation, I got a notification from LinkedIn. The company had just posted a job opening - not in the same department but was the desired roll. I was thrilled… until I saw it wasn’t remote and required relocation. I felt disappointed, but I remembered all the signs and decided to trust the process. I applied anyway and also emailed the hiring manager I spoke with last year, trying to get more insights on the remote situation and in hopes she might refer me to the other department.

Weeks went by with no response. I started feeling down… until I saw a post on this subreddit that completely reignited my hope. That same day, I got a call from a hiring partner who worked with the company. He told me he was literally about to close submissions that day when he suddenly had the idea to ask the hiring manager from the other department if she had any referrals. And guess what? She mentioned me - the candidate who had emailed her three weeks ago! He said he was going to forward my details to the company.

And here’s the amazing part: when I asked him about the job not being remote, he told me they had purposely left that out of the job posting to narrow down applicants, but they were definitely open to me working remotely. That felt like a huge confirmation that even what looked like a closed door was really just part of the plan.

Soon after, I got the message that the company wanted to interview me. I was nervous. On the day of the interview, they asked to reschedule from morning to afternoon. So I went for coffee to calm down, and on my way out, I saw the clearest sign of all: a huge billboard I walk past every day suddenly had a giant version of the company's logo on it, along with the words:
“Prove your worth.”

This ad was actually for a youth program and had nothing to do with the company - I even checked their socials and couldn’t find the symbol in any other versions of the ad. It felt like it was meant just for me, and even the interview being postponed for later that day, since I wasn't supposed to be out of the house before the interview. I smiled from ear to ear and walked into the interview feeling confident and aligned.

The interview went  very well, but they asked me to complete an assignment afterward. I was caught a little off guard and submitted it later than expected. This shook my confidence a bit. The weekend before the following week (when I expected a reply), I felt super anxious. On Sunday night, I randomly clicked on the Instagram profile of someone who commented on a post - and her last two posts were of her visiting the headquarters of the company. What are the odds?!
That gave me hope again.

But now, it’s been over a month since the interview, and I still haven’t heard back. About a week and a half in, I contacted the recruiter and he said they had just finished interviews with other candidates. He also mentioned he was going on vacation and that I’d hear back from a colleague. I waited. Nothing.

Last week, I followed up again, and he said he found it strange that they hadn’t replied - they usually always send a yes or no. He said he would reach out to them to check.

Since then, another week has gone by. And I still keep seeing signs - especially on the exact days I start to doubt. It's like the Universe is telling me: “Don't give up.” But I’m human. It’s been so long, and they said they wanted to fill the position quickly, so I’m starting to wonder if it’s really still mine.

I don’t want to lose faith. I really don’t. But I need help interpreting all this and not losing my faith.
Have any of you experienced something similar? What do you do when the signs are still coming, but the results haven’t shown up yet?
While I was on this whole process I couldn't wait for the final result to come and to get the job so that I could come on here and share my happy story and all the amazing things and signs I got all this time because I knew it would inspire someone. Buy today I decided to come for your advice while sharing my story.

By Ceci.Does.Poetry 

He’d made her coffee, strong like he took his. Lightly sweetened. She didn’t mind — not then. She tiptoed barefoot across the cool tile, pulled open the French doors, and stepped into the backyard, her breath laboring at the patch of wildflowers that danced on the breeze. Foxglove. Tansy.

The creak when she opened them echoed through the kitchen. The house was old, but had character. It was charming, lived-in, even loved, once. She stepped barefoot onto the patio, mug cradled in both hands, and exhaled into the morning.

The yard was overgrown in a way that felt more poetic than neglected. A wild sprawl of nature reclaiming its place — dew on the grass, vines creeping up the fence, and at the far end, a patch of foxglove and tansy in full bloom. Soft, tall spikes of bell-shaped flowers swayed like dancers, yellow discs like little suns bowed to her.

She didn’t know what they were at first. She just knew she loved them.

“It was my daughter’s favorite spot,” he said, standing behind her, voice low.

She turned, startled. “Oh? It was?”

He nodded. “She left, then the flowers came”

⸻

They met three months earlier. A bookstore. She’d dropped a copy of “Broke Hoe Rich Spirit” and he’d picked it up.

“Broken, eh?,” he said.

“Healing” she replied, quickly and more honestly than she intended to be with a stranger— but he smiled and the hotness in her face dissipated as she smiled back.

His story unfolded slowly over drinks and walks. A marriage broken under pressure. He told her his wife had left. Said she took his little girl and disappeared without so much as a “Fuck you”, or a goodbye. He hadn’t seen his daughter in nearly a year. His voice cracked when he said it and he quickly cleared his throat. She touched his shoulder and felt that ache in his silence. He spoke in fragments, with pauses like the conversation  was poking wounds that hadn’t quite scabbed over.

She didn’t ask too many questions. She wanted to be the cure, not the interrogator.

When he invited her to move in, it felt natural — like sinking into warm water. Weeks passed like lightning. The house became hers. They painted the kitchen. She framed his daughter’s crayon drawings that were still taped to the refrigerator door. She drank her coffee in the mornings, sun warming her skin, flowers swaying in the corner of her eye like they were waving at her. Beckoning her. 

Life was sweet. 

⸻

Time passed in petals and silences. He was loving, then distant. Affectionate, then cold. There were good days — when he made breakfast and kissed her shoulder just because — but they began to blur beneath the weight of the bad ones.

And then something shifted. The coffee turned bitter. The sunlight harsher. Scorching. 

“Do you always have to sit out there like that?” he asked one day, his voice agitated.

She tried to blink away her confusion. “Like what?”

“Like you’re trying to escape.”

She laughed softly. “I just want to become one with my flowers. 

He said nothing, just stared at the foxglove like it insulted him.

That next morning , she found the patio chair broken in the trash bin sprinkled with the broken shards of her favorite coffee mug. 

⸻

It got worse. Slowly. Like a slow drip of poison in her morning brew.

His voice turned sharp. His hands followed.

Nothing she did was right. Everything deserved punishment. And every strike felt like fire under her skin. 

She began disassociating. Waking up not remembering if she’d eaten the day before. Anxiety pangs gripping her stomach. Dreaming of running, then waking to look down and find that she was wearing her favorite sneakers, and they were muddy. Where had she been? Whole days evaporated like breath on glass.

Sometimes she remembered him standing in the garden at night, digging with a shovel, murmuring to himself. She told herself it was a dream. But she also remembered the dirt under his fingernails, the way his jeans smelled of soil. 

He was planting something next to the wildflowers. Maybe as an apology. She hoped for something equally as beautiful. 



⸻
The apology never came. 

Reality continued to fracture.

She started keeping notes to herself on the mirror:

It’s Thursday.
Take your vitamins.
Call your mom.  

She stopped writing when the notes started vanishing. Or maybe she had never written them in the first place.

⸻

She lost more time. Woke up in strange places. The laundry room. The bathtub. Curled on the kitchen floor with bruises she couldn’t account for.

The mirror became a stranger. Her face — a watercolor left in the rain. Blurred around the edges. Fading.

The patch by the fence was different now. He’d dug up a large unsightly hallow. She could never quite remember what it had looked like before. Only that the wildflowers beside it were still beautiful.

One night, the rain came hard. Slanted, angry, sideways.

She remembered standing at the back door, her palms flat against the glass, tears silently streaming down her face for what was probably the fourth time that day. She stood watching the storm swallow the yard. The Tansy were drowning. She was drowning. She understood why his wife left. 

Before she could finish the thought, her name, yelled from the hallway. His boots thudding down the stairs.

Something snapped in her. She ran.

Out the door. Down the road. Into the woods behind the neighbor’s shed.

The world was wet and spinning. Branches clawed at her skin. Breathing in shallow gasps. She didn’t remember falling. Only the burst of white light behind her eyes, the blaring pain in her head, and the sound of his voice:

“You will NEVER leave me!”

Then — black.

⸻

Stars.

Pinpricks in a velvet sky, drifting slowly above her.

It felt like freedom. The cool of the earth beneath her, the wide open sky above. She saw Orion, and The Big Dipper, tipping into emptiness.

She didn’t try to move.. she was at peace. 

She was warm, somehow. Blanketed in rain drops. Wrapped in a dream. And the dream was showing her everything in pieces.

His hands on her waist that first night. The flower patch in bloom. Her mug on the patio. A thumb pressed to her bruised cheek. Dirt under his nails. The way he whispered her name like a secret. Like a curse.

Memories flickered. Time folded.

And then—

She looked down.

Her shoes.

Muddy again.

Soaked to the ankle in thick sludge.

The wrong kind of mud. Fresh.

She blinked slowly. The ground beside her was uneven. A strange shape.

She turned her head.

Longer than her. Wider than her. Deep. The earth raw and red.

A hole.

Clarity came like ice water — shocking and sharp.

She tried to sit up, but her arms were numb. Heavy. 

And then she was weightless. He carried her in his arms for a matter of seconds. 

Floating for one last moment.

“See?” he said, soft as ever. “You always wanted to become one with their flowers.”

Then falling.

*Hurdop Transport Ship* Divine Breeze

Porti was torn, in a way. The news of the trials and subsequent punishment of the two other Ministers had finally reached him. His crew had been assembled, but there was no doubt that some on board would likely turn him in as soon as they were within signal distance of the Collective authorities. The governments of Vilantia and Terra had put up a substantial bounty for his fur, specifying that he was to be taken alive. On the up side, that meant no disintegration. However, he would need to change his name and quickly. It was harsh to leave thirty-three generations behind, but he salved his conscience by reminding him that this was temporary. In this the Helots had been invaluable; his identity had been altered to Itrop without a great deal of questioning. The crew reacted to Porti's new name with a collective shrug; names were changed almost as often as socks on Draconis. Whether that was a statement on the general lawlessness of the system or the general hygiene of its inhabitants was up for debate.

The variety in his crew meant that he'd had to have his engineers install variable gravity - at significant cost. While the Helots had no vocalized complaints, the Terrans and Pavonians were quick to complain. The Terrans because of the gravity, and the Pavonians because of the gravity and (lack of) humidity. The thought crossed his mind again that on the next run he was going to have to consider hiring some Hurdop. At the very least he was going to need a better ship to handle a multi-species crew. He'd put out some anonymous feelers to the other groups who were feeling the keen sting of fate, and the possibility of a new crew for his next venture was becoming likely.

As they emerged from R-space to Vilantia, they received the list of ships that were assigned as 'free salvage'. Generally that meant that the ships had no useful components left. In theory. Between the Terran engineers, the Helot skills, and the overall scavenger skills of the Pavonians, he was well on his way to rebuilding his ship to something proper. They'd received their assignments and went about them without audible complaint, tools slicing the hull of the *Greatlords Fist* and taking delicate components into the ship itself for the Helot to repurpose.

During the work, Itrop had told himself he was going to begin the next step of building a new base to replace what had been lost. Instead, he found himself staring out the bridge viewport at Vilantia. His home. His due, all the things that were his by right taken from him by a commoner. His destiny remained there, but he would have to prove the old way superior before he could ascend properly. The consideration occupied his mind for a time, creating a chain of thought forward and then worked its way backward to that Nameless one. Even though the Throne themselves had declared his Name restored, Itrop couldn't bring himself to even think the name, much less say it. If he couldn't have a proper name, then such a boon was certainly not granted to the Nameless one - and to twilight with what others thought.

""You are thinking of Life-designate-Freelord-Gryzzk."" One of the Helots spoke in their flat voice – it called itself a rather incomprehensible designation of letters and numbers. The Terrans had promptly started calling it Harry, with the other one being Bob.

""Of course I am. What else is there to think of?""

Harry, with an absolute lack of sarcasm detection, began running through the list. ""Food Processor Three has a faulty matter converter control unit, resulting in suboptimal efficiency. Artificial gravity fluctuations continue and random intervals. Crew morale is low. Mutiny probability is currently at thirty-seven percent, with estimated Vilantian casualties being at ninety-five percent in the most optimistic scenario.""

""Why ninety-five?""

""The most optimistic scenario is that you alone would survive by securing the bridge and venting all atmosphere prior to returning to Draconis. After that Helots would continue to serve, you would sell this ship and cargo at a loss and purchase a five-being craft before attempting a takeover of the Throne's Fortune group, which would have a seventy-six percent chance of success due to your standing.""

Itrop leaned back in his chair for a moment. ""Recalculate success probability based on crew complement of fifty percent Vilantian and fifty percent Hurdop, maximum complement of twelve.""

""Success estimates increase to eighty-nine percent. For the parameters requested, this will require a total of fifteen dead among the Hurdop and Vilantians.""

""Their sacrifices will be honored. Select and advise only those that will contribute to success."" Itrop's face was grimly set. He would see Vilantia take it's proper place, and those who died walking victory's path would be given proper memorial.

Gryzzk awoke in his bed and looked around. The scent of the estate crept into his sleep-fogged brain and he left the bed, dressed in his proper clothes, and was halfway to the Lord's Quarters before memory swatted him with an iron bar. After that, a deep breath and a return to his old quarters was in order, and then a quiet change of clothing to his Legion wear.

Then he looked upon the front of the estate with a slight whimper. The company appeared to have refused to return to their quarters on the ship, and as a result the normally immaculate lawn of the estate was a shambles of strewn bodies, discarded garments, and empty mugs carelessly resting on tables that seemed to be sticky with something unknown. The saving grace was that Groundskeeper Will'ey was curled up with one of the ships' cooks. He exhaled softly and tapped his rank for a channel to Rosie.

""Freelord, it's early. Shouldn't you be in bed with your wives?""

""As a Freelord, I have duties that cannot be set aside.""

The XO's voice went up about half an octave with her initial reply. ""Give your balls a tug, titfucker."" Rosie paused. ""Freelord Major Titfucker. You've got two days of R&R, two wives, and a law on the books that says make some anklebiters. Shut your piehole and get after it.""

""Before that can occur, I should very much like to know the status of the companies.""

""Bravo got their supplies delivered, if that's what you're asking. Meanwhile Captain Rostin oversaw two marriages, Bravo Company's security platoon had a little donnybrook with some locals in Throne City who think purple is a dirty color – three arrests, everyone paid their fines and went back to the bar, nothing to worry about there.""

""Do they have a nickname yet?""

""Honey Badgers. A specific type of Terran animal that is relatively small, fairly intelligent, and couldn't give a fuck if they got it financed.""

""Good. It seems to be bad luck for a company to be formed without a nickname. If there is a sober pilot available, could you have them shuttle some breakfast down for the clan?""

""Breakfast arriving in twenty minutes. That's all the ship's business I have because there's a ninety-two percent chance your wives are coming up behind you. Get to work, Freelord."" With that, Rosie killed the channel.

True to the prediction, Grezzk and Kiole came up behind him with their morning tea. They were both wearing nightclothes of a sort - Grezzk found one of Gryzzk's shirts and was wearing it to the exclusion of anything else, while Kiole had wrapped herself in a bedsheet.

""Our children are rambunctious, my handsome hand."" Grezzk leaned into his shoulder calmly as she surveyed the carnage that was a company of mercenaries and neighboring guests. It was a definite change of reaction. Before, she would have been as outraged as civility would allow; now she simply watched as unconscious forms stirred to wakefulness.

There was a soft chuckle of sorts. ""I think our lands have had so little to celebrate for so long, they availed themselves of the opportunity to excess.""

The whine of a shuttle landing was a surrogate alarm for most of the sleeping forms, and U'wekrupp started laying out simple fare – sandwiches and burritos along with tea, juice, and coffee. The basic nature of the food may have been at least partly due to the fact that the cooks were themselves hungover and knew what was needed.

O'Brien smelled coffee in her sleep and stirred, sitting up. Or at least making a valiant attempt, as she finally rolled over to her hands and knees and slowly levered herself upright before wobbling to the table with her joints popping and creaking protests. She moved by scent to the breakfast table, opening one eye slowly. She retrieved a muffin and coffee before wobbling to the porch to stand near Gryzzk, elbows on the railing.

""Sir. With all due respect to the Vilantian people and your fine knowledge of how to have good time...*fuck* your gravity. I think I'm spending today upstairs on the ship. I may come back to this place and sightsee if we can tomorrow if it's allowed. ""

""I believe Lady Ah'nuriel would be pleased to see you.""

""Fair enough. I'm gonna take this to the shuttle and tell my ankles the revolution is not nigh. They're plotting with my knees and hips for better working conditions. Today is gonna be proper G's, ice packs, ice cream, and bad movies."" With that, O'Brien wobbled unsteadily to the shuttle where the gravity had been lowered to Terran standard.

The rest of the Terrans were of a similar mindset. Vilantia was a fine place to visit, but overnight camping did not seem to be on anyone's priority list. There was mild amusement as Lomeia seemed to be the only Vilantian going back to the *Twilight Rose*. Gryzzk convinced himself it was so Reilly could give a tour.

As the wedding guests slowly rose and exited, with the last one being the Minister of Communication, still wearing the same commoner wear she had been wearing last night, though somewhat askew. She was carrying her ministerial robe under her arm.

Gryzzk blanched at her appearance. ""Minister, your fur..."" He began brushing grass from her shoulders.

""Do not concern yourself. I will be going home and cleaning myself to assume my duties again. I feel quite refreshed by this week, and my husbands await my return anxiously.""

A personal shuttle began descending, and there was a soft smile on the old ministers face. ""Very anxiously, it seems.""

Once the minister had departed, things seemed different somehow. The guest of honor had left, and the day had officially begun. The daughters slowly walked out to the porch, wiping sleep from their eyes and carefully leaning.

Nhoot looked up. ""Can we see more of Mama 'n Papa's home?""

There was a smile from Kiole. ""I'd like that. It seems peaceful. Though we may require a change. It is quite possible that wearing a bedsheet and a shirt is not so fashionable here as it is on the homeworld."" She and Grezzk clasped hands and went to find something to wear.

The next days were full for Gryzzk. Walking with his larger family to special places that only three of them remembered, giving care to Lady A'Kefab's new tree, meals cooked by Grezzk and the staff, balancing ship reports with telling stories to both Ah'nuriel and Pafreet about the seasonal changes they could look forward to, and then early evenings of planning the future of the Ah'nuriel estate. The Minister of Science had dusted off old plans that seemed to be bold – there was even talk of reclaiming the ancient wastelands that were once held by the Forever Nameless Clan. This last item was heavily debated in the news. After debates and a small amount of wine, Gryzzk would retire with his wives to their bedchamber. Eventually they would sleep.

Finally the family had to heed the march of time, and Gryzzk stood on the bridge once again with Nhoot as they watched the *Swift River* wink into R-space and took stock of the ship.

""XO, confirm the company is present and accounted for and that we have no stowaways."" There was a pause as Gryzzk considered further. ""Additionally, request a similar verification from Captain Rostin.""

""All crew present and aboard, helmets have been issued. Reilly's girlfriend is not hiding anywhere on either ship, Freelord Major.""

Reilly hmph'ed softly. ""You need to hire her for admin work already. Sir.""

""We'll be going over personnel matters in R-space. For now, Captain Hoban set course to the rendezvous coordinates when Orbital Control permits.""

""Hooah, Major.""

With *Twilight Rose* in the lead, the ships approached a relatively clear patch of space and held position. It was time for Gryzzk to deliver the news. He thumbed the all-hands channel.

""Alpha Company, this is Major Gryzzk. As you know, we'll be accompanying the M5 acrobatics team to Moncilat. As part of our job, some of you will be working as undercover recon, due to unknown but unfriendly elements who wish to see the performances and the attendant newly crafted resorts fail. In order to acclimate to Moncilat as rapidly as possible, we will be making adjustments to the common area gravity as well as ambient temperature and humidity - it will be Moncilat standard until the conclusion of our job. You may note the helmets you were issued. Secure them now, as environment will be adjusted in three, two, one."" Gryzzk nodded to Rosie, and the appropriate fields were adjusted. The bridge squad threw on their helmets - they weren't particularly thick, but they would protect against the worst that a careless movement would bring. Each had been decorated and on the front where normally they had their names was instead a callsign. For O'Brien, her tartan helmet was emblazoned with the name 'Shamrock'. Next was Hoban, a simple blue helmet with 'Washout' in yellow. Third was Edwards, who had decorated her helmet with downward-pointing horns and painted shipmetal gray with 'Jarl' in a carved runic script as well as standard. Lastly, Reilly had painted her helmet with twilight roses and the name 'Streaker' was prominent.

Satisfied, Gryzzk continued with the announcement, standing to put his own helmet on and promptly floating up to hit his head on the ceiling. He winced as he fell far too slowly back to the chair. ""Now, since I know this is unusual, you are authorized to...express yourselves with helmet decoration. During the trip through R-space, you will be monitored and sergeants are to take the names of those with the fewest helmet-scratches for further vetting for surface duty. Those selected will receive further briefing later."" Gryzzk signed off and rubbed the top of his head for a moment before looking at the helmet.

It was properly purple, however the rest of the bridge squad had been unable to decide on a callsign, and so it was decorated with multiple names in various colors - 'Freelord Major Captain Papa', 'Wee Viking', 'Mal', 'Dovakhiin', and 'Rabbit of Caerbannog'.

""I fail to understand all of these, but..."" Gryzzk secured the helmet to his head and took a breath. It was time to check with the engineering space. He tapped the control.

""Tucker's Zero-Gee Tittybar where even a nana's nannerboobs can get a motorboat, DJ Helicockter speaking whazzup?!""

""This is Major Gryzzk – Chief Tucker, please advise if there are any longterm consequences regarding the altered common area environment.""

""Hell, we could do this all month if we had to, we're throwing forty percent less power into the grav system. The humidity's gonna be a bitch though.""

""Secure a detail if you have to; have the common areas inspected twice a day for potential issues.""

""Can do Maje.""

The channel closed and Gryzzk shook his head. ""I don't even understand what half of that greeting was – nobody enlighten me, please. I would rather remain ignorant for the moment.""

Fortunately there was a little chirrup from the comm channel, and Reilly swiveled before she could impart undesired knowledge. ""We're being hailed, Major – it's the *Hyneman*.""

""Put it through.""

The figure that appeared on the holo was large, similar to Major Williams - but with an exceptionally large mustache and black beret, with casual pants but a formal white shirt. Beside him was the ship's XO, similarly dressed but with slightly different features. ""Major Gryzzk, this is Captain Grant of the *Hyneman* with XO Jamie. You're our escorts?""

""Yes – you've received all the necessary documentation?""

""We have, Major. All in all, impressive record for a new merc outfit. Probably won't have any grief from the local militia, but according to a friend I know, there's a pirate group that's only technically sanctioned by Hurdop trying to either go legit or turn Moncilat into a new ops base.""

""Our intelligence suggests similar activity.""

""Whelp, we can talk about it or jump through the flaming hoop.""

""We'll see you in three days then, Captain.""

The communication dropped, and for the first time Gryzzk saw the *Hyneman*. It was radically different from any Terran design he'd seen, with the appearance of a polished metal sphere that had been cut in half with a brim of sorts.

""XO, kindly remind me where we've that particular design before?""

""We have not, Freelord Major. It seems that Terran entertainers use their ships as a secondary form of advertisement. I'm not sure they're advertising, though – slogans such as 'Jamie wants big boom', 'Quack, damn you', 'Am I missing an eyebrow?' and 'When in doubt, C4' are odd. Even for me.""

""Very well. Sergeant Reilly, signal readiness to move, we'll keep the *Hyneman* between the two of us.""

Gryzzk watch the forward view as the ships began their motion to move to R-space, and then the stars began streaking behind them. He relaxed a bit, standing and getting used to the fact that gravity was going to be a polite hint for the foreseeable future. He experimented slowly, moving as little as possible and then slowly moving forward faster and testing ways to slow his momentum.

He left the bridge for the evening meal to find that his company was testing themselves similarly by playing Vilantian soccer in the port-side hallway. The key difference between the two worlds being that there were always two balls in play (more in extra time) with Vilantian soccer. Other than that, the object was the same – see the ball, kick the ball behind the other team's goalie. However, the teams had one Terran ball and one Vilantian. Gryzzk watched for a moment; they seemed to be learning how to best utilize the gravity in conjunction with their own athletic abilities. Or lack thereof, as Captain Gregg-Adams (Nickname 'PapaBear') put his entire body behind an errant shot that clobbered Gryzzk's face, ricocheted off the walls five times and dribbled behind the stunned goalie.

Gryzzk's vision went septuple momentarily as his brain processed the event, with the teams being dead silent and waiting for some manner of disapproval. Finally he stood and pointed in the general direction of the ball that was nestled in the corner of the net.

""I...I believe that's a goal.""

There was a pause and nods all around as Rosie calmly announced the score. ""Armory five, Supply four, Bridge one. Center kickoff for the Terran ball, Vilantian ball kickoff at the spot it was at when the goal was scored."" A whistle signified the return to play.

Over the time in R-space, everyone was adjusting to the new parameters – and it seemed that engaging in sports was the best way to rapidly acclimate. Nhoot took full advantage of the new settings and was often seen scampering on the walls or ceiling going from one place to another. She'd placed small lights on her helmet to spell out ""Wee Grape"". Jonesy on the other hand expressed her displeasure for the new setting by lounging in the dayroom and sulking.

No part of the ship was untouched. The mess hall earned its name anew as eating became an exercise in cautious nibbling, the armory was hard pressed to keep oils and supplies secured, and medical was doing brisk business treating minor but painful injuries. Through it all though it seemed that the adjustments were being learned. Additionally, Gryzzk found his work was disturbed - lengthy reading of materials was almost impossible for some reason, and so he'd had to have Rosie read him a summation of the Moncilat. Overall an unremarkable species that evolved from prey animals, adept with camouflage, sensors, and defensive systems - they'd managed to survive after the planets' predators had hunted each other to extinction. Physically tall, but rapid reflexes; their post-contact existence as members of the Collective had them fall into architecture and artisanal niches. Rosie made her opinion known.

""Bunch of ten-ply long-cats. This'll be fun.""

Finally the R-space field fled, and the three ships formed up to make the last leg of their journey. The bridge squad was assembled and at work.

Edwards was the first to report. ""Cap I got six unknowns inbound. Shape indicates Moncilat."" There was a breath. ""IFF interrogation coming back as Collective.""

O'Brien chimed in. ""They still got insanely good shielding, but they still haven't figured out how to put on a gun on their hulls."" There was a pause. ""According to them, it 'breaks the aesthetic balance' or something.""

Reilly was next. ""We're being hailed by the lead ship - registration *Leafborn*.""

Gryzzk stood carefully, removing his helmet but keeping it in hand as the holo resolved. He stood, smiled, and gestured carefully.

""Greetings. I am Major Gryzzk of the Terran Foreign Legion on lawful contract -"" His smile and opening greeting were cut off by the image of what was presumably the captain flowing gracefully behind their command chair. After a long moment, a single red eye peered from behind the makeshift cover.

""*WE SURRENDER*!"" The voice was high in pitch and unmistakable in intent. The scent-markers coming in were pure unadulterated fear.

Gryzzk blinked. From the look of the bridge squad, this was not an expected action.",24,1744729273.0,HFY,13,1.0,False

We agreed to go on a first date which was coffee (her idea). I actually enjoy coffee being the first date as it’s super casual and cheap. after that date I texted her a couple hour later saying coffee was fun and lmk if you get letterboxd (she asked me during coffee if I had letterboxd because I was talking about how I enjoy movies) to which she hearted the message and said coffee was so much fun!! i’m downloading it rn. we continue to talk a little bit and the next day I ask her if she’s free sometime next week. she said she was free sunday so I asked if she’s wanted to get sushi and she said she would love to. the date went well again and we ended up going to target after because she needed to get some batteries. I drove her back to her place and about 10 minutes later she texted me saying sushi was so fun ◡̈ and your car is so cool!! I said it was a lot of fun aswell and then texted her saying: I found a vinyl store nearby if you’re free anytime this week would you want to go? she responded with: yeah sure! i’ll lyk my schedule tomorrow - have to figure out our recording schedule. I just hearted the message which was sunday night and now it’s Tuesday and I haven’t heard from her. It’s odd because throughout the 2 weeks we have been talking she would sometime respond to my texts within minutes and sometimes would take 3-10 hours. but we would snapchat with eachother (just photos no texting) during those times when she wouldn’t respond to my texts. I figure because we have only been on now two dates it’s whatever, but now i’m worried i’m wasting my time and that she may not be interested if she’s not responding. The only reason I can think she’s not interested is because during our dates she has carried the conversation as I have a ton of anxiety and dating is super stressful for me. She doesn’t know that’s the reason and she may assume i’m not interested if I am acting that way especially as a guy, but I may be overthinking that because if she wasn’t interested why would she text me after the date, but who knows.

I got so bored dicking around at home, now being an empty nester,  and there were only so many projects I could do without either killing my wallet or getting myself killed that enough was enough 

(2 car full restoration and repaint, 5 months total. 1 track car rebuilt, 1 failed EV car conversion, lots of time in a high school robotics workshop voluntering.) 

So back to work, I went from being a senior director of software engineering back to an individual contributing senior software engineer for about the same pay but a lot less bullshit responsibilities so I can focus on the fun technical parts...

Part of the deal of my employment is I would help setup and  run the lab in the local office ....So for the past few days, I was pulling cables out,  putting them in, running ethernet and coax cables, RF antennas, setting up test benches....and thets where  I took a step back and laughed at the irony..

See, approximately 25 years ago,  I started my first new job fresh out of school, and had a really tough interview with a small company at the time called Qualcomm... And after several rounds of interviews with the most excruciating technical whiteboard interview questions about DSP, wireless communication, etc I finally got the job...

And what was I doing when I started ? Pulling cables out, setting up the lab, running ethernet cables setting up lab equipment...And I hated it.. I was a hotheaded and arrogant kid, and insulted that after graduating from gruelling electrical engineering degree from within.the top 5% of my class from pedigree top 10 school... I was relegated to pulling cables an running ethernet cables and testing cellular equipment that a monkey could do...It was insulting, infuriating, and after 2 years and self-teaching myself how to do software, I was still blocked from moving into a softwre engineering role because I didnt have a masters degree....

So I said fuck this, and took an offer from a startup in SiliconValley/Bay area that said they were going public with an IPO ""anyday now"" and they offered me my first opportunity to do software despite having no prior experience....so i took it , left to join the startup, and that was the start of 25 good years of software engineering....

Fast forward today...coming out of senior management/forced retirement, hired into a senior software engineer role... and my first task 25 years later? Pull cables out, run ethernet cable, setup lab equipment, setup RF antennas, setup test benches...

And now, what do I think about doing that? ....Wait you want to pay me this much to do this kind of work.... SCORE!  I dont give a shit and would be happy to pour coffee for you for how much you pay me for this...  🤣

Oh my, what 25 years in the business does to you.... (I also wont speculate the financial damage I did to myself leaving qualcomm 23 years ago,  32:1 stock split ago simply because I was a young impatient kid. That was financially painful...)",28,1744728706.0,Fire,21,0.89,False

# Rancilio Silvia PID (2025): Is it Still Worth It? Review & Alternatives

The Rancilio Silvia has long been a favorite among home baristas seeking a reliable adn capable espresso machine. But in 2025, with a plethora of options flooding the market, the question arises: Is the Rancilio Silvia PID, whether pre-installed or as an upgrade, still a worthwhile investment? This in-depth review explores the pros and cons, delves into the benefits of a PID controller, and compares the Silvia to alternative machines, helping you make an informed decision.

[[Explore Top Rated rancilio silvia pid on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=rancilio silvia pid)
## The Enduring Appeal of the Rancilio Silvia

The Rancilio silvia enjoys a reputation built on robust construction, a commercial-grade group head, and the potential for excellent espresso. Its simple design belies its ability to produce shots rivaling those from more expensive machines – especially when paired with a skilled user and high-quality beans.

However, the Silvia's Achilles' heel has always been its temperature control. The inherent cycling of the thermostat leads to meaningful temperature fluctuations, impacting shot consistency and making it challenging to dial in that perfect extraction. This is where the PID controller comes into play.

[[Explore Top Rated rancilio silvia pid on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=rancilio silvia pid)
## Unlocking Precision: What a PID Does for the Rancilio Silvia

A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is a sophisticated feedback mechanism that precisely regulates temperature. Unlike the stock thermostat, a PID constantly monitors the boiler temperature and makes adjustments to maintain the set point, minimizing temperature swings. For the Rancilio Silvia, this translates to several key benefits, explaining why so many seek a rancilio silvia pid upgrade:

**1. Unwavering Temperature Stability:** The most significant advantage is the dramatically improved temperature stability. A rancilio silvia pid kit, when properly installed, ensures the brewing water remains within a narrow temperature range throughout the extraction process. This results in more consistent and repeatable shots, allowing you to fine-tune your technique for optimal results.

**2. Enhanced Shot Quality:** Consistent temperature is crucial for extracting the desired flavors from coffee grounds. A PID-controlled silvia allows you to achieve brighter,sweeter,and more nuanced espresso,free from the bitterness and sourness associated with temperature instability.

**3. Faster Recovery Time:** With a PID, the Silvia recovers more quickly after pulling a shot or steaming milk. this reduces downtime and allows you to make more drinks in succession without sacrificing quality.

**4. Preinfusion Capabilities (Potential):** Some PID kits offer programmable preinfusion, a technique that gently saturates the coffee puck before applying full pressure. Preinfusion can improve extraction evenness and increase the sweetness and body of your espresso. Many users are specifically looking for a rancilio silvia pid preinfusion.

**5. Steaming Performance (indirectly):** While the PID primarily focuses on brewing temperature, it also indirectly improves steaming performance by maintaining a more consistent boiler temperature.

## The Rancilio Silvia PID: Factory Option vs. DIY Upgrade

You have primarily two options when acquiring a Rancilio Silvia with a PID: purchasing a pre-modified machine or installing a PID kit yourself.

**Buying a Pre-modified Rancilio Silvia PID:** Several retailers offer the Silvia with a PID pre-installed. The key benefit here is convenience. The installation is done professionally, and you avoid the hassle of DIY. Furthermore, warranty issues are less likely than if you install the PID yourself.However, pre-modified machines typically carry a higher price tag. You can find where to buy rancilio silvia pid from many online retailers who specialize in espresso machines.

**DIY Rancilio Silvia PID Installation:** For the adventurous and budget-conscious, installing a PID kit yourself is a viable option. Many kits are available, ranging from basic temperature controllers to more advanced models with preinfusion and other features. Brands like Auber Instruments are well-regarded for thier quality and comprehensive instructions. When choosing a kit, consider features like display type, sensor placement, and programmability. A significant benefit of the DIY approach is cost savings. In certain specific cases, a DIY installation can be substantially cheaper than purchasing a pre-modified machine.

## Navigating the PID Kit Landscape: Features and Considerations

Choosing the best pid for rancilio silvia requires careful consideration of your needs and technical abilities. Here are some key features to consider:

*   **Temperature Display:** Look for a clear and easy-to-read display that shows both the set temperature and the actual boiler temperature.*   **Sensor Type:** The type and placement of the temperature sensor can affect accuracy.Some kits use an RTD sensor, while others use a thermocouple. Consider the manufacturer's recommendations for sensor placement.
*   **Programmability:** Some kits allow you to customize PID parameters, such as proportional gain, integral time, and derivative time. This level of control allows you to fine-tune the PID's performance to match your specific brewing preferences.
*   **preinfusion:** If your interested in preinfusion, make sure the kit supports it and offers programmable settings.
*   **installation Instructions:** The quality of the installation instructions is crucial for a accomplished DIY project. Look for kits with detailed, well-illustrated instructions.
*   **Customer Support:** Check if the manufacturer offers customer support in case you encounter any issues during installation or operation.

She seemed like a genuine and kind person. She’s a hard worker and climbed up to a director role in her company. But, she has said some really problematic things that honestly just make me never want to hear from her again. 

For example, we visited a mutual friend out of town this past weekend. She mentioned how she’s excited for a recession so she can buy stocks at a low price. I work with and know many people who are low socioeconomically and I know how brutal a recession will be on them. They were both excited for the recession and I responded with “that’s really bad!” I explained my position but they had no interest in hearing me out.

At the very best, she’s materialistic and selfish and at the worst, straight up malicious which I have no interest in being around someone like that. She also claims to not follow the news but always blames Black individuals for any problems and has Fox News talking points. I had to use the restroom at the coffee shop where this conversation happened and I come out to hear her say “that’s bad” in a mocking tone and I know they were talking about me. She jokes that our mutual friend and I can’t get rid of her and she’ll be in our lives. She’s a refugee herself and her family, like mine, didn’t have means growing up so I don’t understand the severe lack of empathy. 

I know I can slow fade but she knows a lot about me and we’re part of a small immigrant community where everyone knows everything about one another. She twists what I have said around often and I’m positive she’ll twist a lot of other things. 

What is the best thing I can do? I don’t have any interest in pursuing either “friendship” in the future.",1,1744728560.0,socialskills,6,0.67,False

The resolution, revised by Directors Glowitz and Martinez, incorporates OSPI guidance and state law. The board also revisited internal disagreement over Highly Capable (Hi-Cap) student growth data, with Glowitz defending his prior statements and Lurie rejecting his interpretation, calling for better analysis tools. Additionally, board members debated changes to the public comment policy, exploring speaker time limits and linkage sessions to better manage lengthy meetings while still allowing for meaningful community engagement. A trial time-limit policy will be tested at the next meeting, with further review in May.[(info)](https://www.mi-reporter.com/news/mi-school-board-passes-resolution-on-immigration-enforcement/?utm_source=seastside.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=seastside-newsletter-65)

So I'm in 5 person student accommodation flat, one of the people have left so it's just me and three other girls. We'll since i don't have a permanent home to back to as such I just stay in my flat while everyone goes home and see's their families. Then the last girl had left the kitchen was in a proper state. There had been 6 bin bags for me to take out, moldy food in the freezer and the microwave was in a mess, there was this brown gunk covering the bottom part of the microwave and it stunk too. I had to use three cleaning sponges and a knife to scrape out whatever the fuck it was.

This is where its my fault on my behalf. Before everybody had left, my university was going through a stage of political protests. To make their point more clear, tents where pitched outside the university library as such people would be staying there for the time being. As because I thought it was a good cause I donated alot of the old bowls and plates I weren't using, along with a bag of toiletries and a old half full coffee jar and a bag of porridge oats. As such and because of my own choice I had basically one of everything

Since everyone would be away for two weeks I had went into other people's cupboards and used their bowls and plates knowing myself I'd wash them all up and return them when they got home. Before in the past there was a cutlery drawer and I had used whatever was in there, sometimes I'd forget to return someone a couple of spoons or knifes. I'd apologise, return them and clean them. Anyway recently one girl came back and she had this guy staying over so I never saw her that much. In terms of flat mate relationship we only hung out all together once and we'd just say hi in the corridors not really making much of conversation. So today one girl had asked to see if I had seen a knife of hers, knowing before I'd forgotten to return a fork before, I'd had a look to see if it was in there and first inspection it wasn't. She quizzed on me why I had to check my room and I looked again. It was in there and I deeply apologised for having it in my room. She then rightly started asking why I had used other people's knifes, forks, spoons and pots in the past. I couldn't really answer as I felt pretty bad, though the truth was that I hadn't made a distinction between the utensils as such as they had been free for others to use. Throughout the whole ordeal she seemed to be crying on which I felt even more bad about and she said she felt she couldn't trust me. When she left I just returned what belonged to the flatmates who where away, washed and put away. I just feel really bad, but yeah full story.

TL;DR I used other people's kitchen equipment away on holiday. I had a girls knife in my room on which I had returned and apologised for using, she blew up at me and I feel really guilty",0,1744728439.0,tifu,8,0.17,False

I have cut down off and on in the past and always feel better but the addiction always has me slowly increasing my intake again. I feel like my mental health, sleep, skin appearance, etc. would improve if I gave it up. I also experience what my doctor calls ""reactive hypoglycemia-like symptoms"" with my blood sugar and suspect I am insulin resistant, and notice that caffeine consumption can impact those blood sugar swings in a bad way. 

My issue is, my addicted brain reminds me of all the health issues that are supposed to be reduced by moderate coffee consumption... Alzheimer's, Type 2 Diabetes, etc. I think of the wonderful antioxidants I am getting with my coffee. I worry that I will be giving up more than I gain by quitting caffeine. My health anxiety and general anxiety causes me to worry that I am holding off some health issues by drinking coffee. 

I'm aware that some of this thinking is over the top. I am currently in counseling. I was hoping someone could help me with a more logical approach to this issue. Thank you! ",0,1744728289.0,decaf,1,0.5,False

Here's how: 
1.  Diet.  I don't count calories or obsess about it, but I eat fairly healthy.  Don't drink calories... They add up quickly.  Just go with water and coffee.  Milk is calories, but is ok/good due to benefits.  Really try to avoid stuff with added sugars... Have a piece of fruit instead.  Much better way to get sugar.

2.  Exercise throughout the entire day.  Pick an exercise (or a few) and just knock it out until you can't do anymore.  Probably 30 seconds of exercise at a time.  I mostly do pushups, but varieties of squats would also work. 

3.  Walk.  Walk a lot.  This is the only time consuming part, but can be enjoyable.  If you're consistently hitting 10,000 steps per day (15,000 if you want super quick change and are ambitious), you'll see great results.  Since walking could suck, I'd consider driving to somewhere good/different and walk there.  More worthwhile while you also explore.  Multi-task by getting your phone calls done, learn something from a podcast, or just lose yourself in some music. 

Here's the part that kinda sucks about this method.  You're hardly putting in any time to difficult tasks.  So, it'll take several weeks/months.  But if you're hitting these goals fairly consistently, you'll see dramatic change in 5'ish weeks.",7,1744728275.0,RandomThoughts,21,0.56,False

When she has cheese for a snack, she cuts it directly on the kitchen counters, she leaves cheese crumbs and her knife that she used out every time. When she has a bagel for breakfast, she takes it out of the toaster, puts it right on the counter and spreads her cream cheese and leaves her messy knife and bread crumbs. When we have chips and salsa on the couch, the bag of chips is out, the salsa is out, she’ll take chips out of the bag, and set them closer to her on the coffee table leaving salt and chip dust.

This had felt like a minor inconvenience when we were dating, but eventually I found I was growing resentful when I was cleaning up or fixing the knife marks in our counters. I didn’t think it was fair to her or me to silently harbor these feelings, so I confronted her a few years ago. She did not react well, to the confrontation, but I noticed she occasionally started using paper towels (expensive and wasteful) for under her snacks. 

Fast forward to this weekend, she’s 35 weeks pregnant, and cutting cheese on our counters, but on top of a paper towel, still leaving behind marks on the counter and crumbs. I calmly, almost coyly ask her - how hard is it for you to just grab a plate or a cutting board? You went right under where both of them are stored to grab a paper towel, how is what I am asking any harder? 

She freaked out, started yelling said I was trying to control her, and I have no respect for her. Which is how I felt she was treating me with my basic request. She said she wanted space and threatened to leave the house and go stay alone at our cabin at 35 weeks pregnant.

backstory, i had always been someone that went 1-2 times a day up until here recently. i am 26- i struggled a bit with an ed when i was 14. i gained 90 pounds when i was pregnant with my son when i was 19 and struggled to get it off for years. a job i used to work at sold semaglutide (ozempic) and it did help me get all the weight off. i haven’t taken it since february of last year when i stopped working there and i would say that’s about the time i started having a hard time going to the bathroom. i used to have to take laxatives often, i could only let myself go 2-3 days without going before i had to do something because i get so bloated and just HURT. i had started drinking coffee every morning and that started to help. but here lately it isn’t.
since march i’ve had to buy 5 bottles of magnesium citrate and usually it does the job but this time it isn’t. i’ve put miralax in my coffee this morning and yesterday and it’s not helping. with the mag citrate i took at 4pm yesterday and drank 60oz of water and more throughout the night and this morning. 
is there ANYTHING else i could try that will help? the bloating is so bad i genuinely look how i did when i was 15 weeks pregnant. it’s messing with my mental health at this point as well. i don’t want to go to the hospital, i am on government insurance as of right now and the one im on is trash honestly. also i’m a single mother to a disabled child and i just can’t sit at the er for hours on end and not be able to pick him up from school on time because there’s no one else to get him. also i’d hate to go and them just give me mag citrate or miralax which clearly isn’t working.

No heat, just the light, which gives off a little warmth and helps the starter get extra bubbly and active.

Naturally, I think, Genius. I’m doing that.

So I feed my starter, pop it into the (off) oven, flip the light on, and move on with my day.

I take a work call. I make coffee. I get pulled into more work. Time passes.

At some point, I completely forget that I’ve now designated inside the oven as my new sourdough-growing location.

So, like an absolute idiot, I preheat the oven.

I walk away.

About 20 minutes later, I catch a faint whiff of something… off.

Open the oven.

And there it is:

About me:

* I ride a **Honda CB300R**
* Prefer early morning rides (less traffic, more vibes)
* Not into racing, stunts, or loud exhausts — I ride for the peace and the thrill
* I enjoy exploring **offbeat spots, scenic routes, chai tapris**, and maybe the occasional 2-day road trip (like Mysore, Coorg, or Nandi Hills on steroids 😄)

What I’m looking for:

* Riders who are **chill, safe, and consistent**
* Okay with **last-minute rides or planned mini-trips**
* Respect traffic rules and don’t turn every ride into a MotoGP 😂

DM me if you:

* Ride solo but wouldn’t mind having 1-2 solid folks to ride with

1jztegw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/1jztegw/fellow_fatigue_warriors/,Fellow Fatigue Warriors,"A friend stopped to visit me yesterday, I haven’t left the house much recently. She has a different autoimmune disease and she understands fatigue. We were commiserating, and she said her partner of 15 years still doesn’t understand fatigue. We were laughing about it, and talking about going with each other to doctor appointments. We live in an extremely rural area, and so a visit to the doctor means a hour and half drive. And, since you don’t go to the “big city” that often, you bundle a bunch of errands with your doctor appointment, go to Costco, and drive an hour and a half home. Barely get the frozen stuff put away, shovel some food in, and go to bed.

I worked with an OT for fatigue, which is all about behavior changes. So, the 2 days before my last appointment, I conserved energy. I took a shower the night before. I got 9 hours of sleep, and I had 3 hours to get ready. I drank two 20oz coffees at home, took modafinil, and drove to town. I got a quad espresso in town and drove to the big city. I went to 2 stores, took another modafinil at 1:30, got a Diet Coke and went to my appointment. (And, it looks like smoldering MS) Then I went to Costco, drove home, dropped groceries at my dad’s, and went to my place and put stuff away. Thank God for Costco ready made street tacos, they are even good cold! I was asleep by 7 pm. And it took me almost a week to recover from the one day.

So, when someone says they are always tired, too, when you talk about your fatigue, ask them this: If you got 9 hours of sleep, drank 40 oz of coffee, 4 shots of espresso, a Diet Coke, and took 400mg of speed, could you go to sleep at 7pm?",10,1744727614.0,MultipleSclerosis,1,1.0,False

We went and ended up spending the entire day together, we got sushi he came over to mine, helped me cook dinner, and even at one point asked me on an actual date. However the next day he expressed that he thought I was too young and wanted to be friends and that if he did date me it would have to lead to something serious. However we still hung out again and I expressed how I wouldn’t even be in the city this summer (for work) and we can keep it causal, I ended up at the coffee shop again to do some work with my roommates, and he asked me to go out, and then we made plans for him to cook dinner and we even messed around relatively fast, and did the “tango.” But things got pretty domestic after this, I have spent the night about 3 times and twice in a row this past weekend we’ve gone on dates, he plans stuff, he cooks breakfast while I sit on his couch and read, we laugh and have hung out without fooling around. 

While this is all good it’s confusing me, does he like me? I mean he said something the other day along the lines of “when you meet my family…” then he cut himself off and whispered “I don’t wanna say when you meet my family.” But then he said it boldly “when you meet my family.” But before this I asked him if he was “doing the tango” with anyone else, he said no but then said “just to transparent” there were people who came into the coffee shop that asked for his number and he gave it to them, but why tell me that?

1jztaxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1jztaxk/passed_my_security_exam_this_saturday/,Passed my Security+ exam this Saturday 🎉,"Hi, I'd like to share my experience with CompTIA Security+ (SYO-701), which I managed to pass even though I wasn't feeling 100% ready.

For context, I have a BSc in a cybersecurity related field and I've been working as a cyber GRC analyst for two years, so I wasn't unfamiliar with most concepts on the exam. Still, I was very nervous about it since I have work colleagues more experienced than me who attempted the exam and failed.

Here's a quick overview of my exam experience so you can get a quick idea of how it went for me:
- Hours dedicated for studying: about 110 hours over a month
- Resources (in order of importance): Official Study Guide and Practice Tests from Mike Chapple and David Seidl, Professor Messer's YouTube playlist, CompTIA Security+ quizzes app
- Total cost: Voucher + Retake and virtual Study Guide was $581 (reimbursed by my employer), physical format Study Guide and Practice Tests books were about $140 (borrowed from coworker who took the exam before me), YouTube playlist is free (though Professor Messer has some paid resources I didn't use), and the app is mostly free and there's a 3 days trial of the premium membership which I activated right before the exam then cancelled it so I paid nothing
- Time during exam: About an hour and 15 minutes, including revision 
- Final score: 790 (could've done better but rushed at the end because I got incredibly thirsty since I had a coffee right before the exam)

Some tips and tricks:
- Make sure you structure your learning schedule so you have at least a week or two for doing quizzes; this will help with checking your understanding of the information you learned and you'll easily identify any weak points
- When purchasing the bundle, if you want to get a retake as well I recommend looking for the Basic Bundle (should be around $581) because there's one purchase option that costs $808 even though it only offers the voucher with retake but no Study Guide despite its increased price
- Get plenty of rest on weekends to avoid burnout, no need to study 24/7
- Mix learning from the books with watching YouTube videos, this will help keep you engaged and you probably won't get bored easily 
- Taking notes helps a lot, I kept a notebook where I'd write down acronyms and their definitions
- I tried the courses on Udemy too since my employer offers a membership for free, but I found those videos less helpful and not as complete as Professor Messer's
- On exam day, make sure there's nothing else on your desk than your monitor, peripherals and laptop/PC; it's best to prepare it the day before or early in the day if you take the exam in the afternoon 
- Eat something and stay well hydrated before the exam; if you have coffee it's best to have some water afterwards and make sure you have enough time for a toilet break before the exam check in time
- You'll have to take a selfie during the check in, so you might want to look good for it (sadly I didn't know and had a bad acne day, would've worn makeup if I knew a picture was needed, especially since it will be kept on your post-exam report)
- Make sure you don't leave the camera's view at any point if you take the exam at home like I did, you're supervised continuously throughout the exam and any suspicious movement or even background noise could result in the exam being suspended (I had no issues with this, everything went smoothly)
- You can flag any questions you're unsure about during the exam, and once you reach the final question you'll unlock the review screen which allows you to go back to any question you want to do at the end or double check (the button should be in the lower left corner)

Next steps:
- I'm considering taking CRISC next since my boss recommended that, however I'm curious about other people's experience post-Security+, so any opinions or advice are welcome.

[Original Post -unddit](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/relationship_advice/comments/1cxsft2/he_32m_slapped_me_26f_so_bad_i_fell_to_the_floor/) **May 22, 2024**

I am 26 and I work in a airport coffee shop. I started sleeping with a guy who is an airline pilot. He is 32. I also found the job so cool since I was a kid. He is good looking too, so many reasons to give it a try, although I am not into hook up culture. We did it once, then it happened again after like 3 weeks later. At that point he asked me for my number, so we could be in touch. I was happy. It's been already 4 months that we see each other when he can. Usually when he is off it is for a few days.

I am sure I am not a side chick, because last time we met, he also put a photo of us on social media.

I was not sure I want a stable relationship, so I was fine with the fact we see each other very rare. I recently broke up and I enjoy not being with someone in a serious way. He made me feel good. He is funny and intelligent too. Lately though he has been very different. At first he made me feel bad for working in an airport coffee shop, like it's a not a good enough job. Then, he also raised his voice at me for waking him up by accident. I went to bathroom and the door woke him up.

And 2 days ago he slapped me. Very bad. I fell to the floor. We had a fight about the way he treats me and how he looks down on me for not having a better job, not being ambitious enough. I am not the kind of person to tolerate such things and I called him an arrogant a$$hole. He hit me, walked out of my apartment and after 3 hours he texted me to apologise. He said he was tired, he had a very long flight, stressed. I told him I cannot forgive him and I will stop seeing him. He said fine, that he understands this but he wants to talk to me tomorrow, after I am done with my shift. I agreed and I'm not sure I should have, but told him we will talk in a public place, where people are around.

He acted offended and tried to talk me out of it, that he wants to be alone with me, but in the end he agreed. Tomorrow we will meet. I am confused and not happy with myself that I agreed, but there are things I want to tell him too, about his behaviour, about how I like my job and that my ambition has nothing to do with it. I am at college, but we never got to talk about this. Overall I want to tell him he was a jerk. Is it a mistake I could regret? I don't want to go with him anywhere to be alone.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**Accomplished\_Trip\_**

>You should not meet with him ever again, under any circumstances. He hit you.

**GraceOfTheNorth**

>The ""one last meeting for closure"" is the single most dangerous moment when dealing with abusive men. This is when they'll exact revenge upon her for hurting their ego. This is when they'll make sure that ""if I can't have you nobody else can"" etc.

>OP would be putting her life in danger. I think she needs to record a phone call with him and get his confession on tape, then go to the police and press charges.

>Even though nothing comes out of it this will be on record and perhaps evidence in the case that the next woman presses against him for violence. This guy is dangerous

**i\_nobes\_what\_i\_nobes**

>That’s how I lost a friend of mine. She broke up with her extremely abusive boyfriend, she told her brother she was going back to the apartment because she knew he was away on a business trip and she was going to get her things. He showed up at the house, he found her in the bathroom and he stabbed her to death.

>He then ran from the state and was found two states away writing a suicide note about to kill himself.

>Apparently, he just needed closure.

I don’t even know where to begin. Maybe because we never got to end properly. You disappeared, and left me holding all the weight.

In just a short span of time, we built something that felt real to me. Not just a routine or a crush—it was a rhythm. We shared space, thoughts, laughter. You offered warmth and presence. And I let myself believe it was safe to open up. To trust. To hope. I thought I mattered to you.

That one disagreement - it wasn’t that big. But it cracked something in you, didn’t it? And instead of staying to work through it, you vanished. You blocked me. You shut the door. And I was left in the silence, trying to make sense of it all.

I think what hurts most isn’t losing you. It’s losing who I was when I was around you.

The version of me that felt seen. Heard. Cherished, even. That girl is still standing at that coffee table, still walking down those streets, still waiting in the elevator for someone who no longer turns around.

And I know I need to let go. I know you’re not coming back.  
But I can’t erase the feeling that there was something between us - something that *deserved more* than being ghosted like a stranger.

  
If it hurts you even half as much as it hurts me, I’ll never know. Maybe that’s not mine to know anymore. Maybe it doesn’t even matter. Because we are strangers now.  
Blocked.  
Distant.  
And I hate those words. I hate that they’ve become the only truth between us. 

Goodbye doesn’t mean it didn’t matter. Goodbye just means I’m choosing to stop waiting.",14,1744726946.0,UnsentLetters,8,0.94,False

It was like that for 3.5 hours! Eventually we called quits on our coffee and went home. But holy shit balls, my dopamine levels were ramped from all that interaction. Not only had I touched myself BEFORE seeing him so I'd not be such a dolt, but immediately when I came home too. Ended up I got zero sleep.

I currently own/operate a fairly successful bakery in a small, large city. I am opening a second retail space. Espresso, pastry, small breakfast/lunch Sammy menu. It will also have tons of packaged foods, grab n go coolers, fresh breads, etc...

The kitchen will operate like a Panera. Very little will be baked or cooked on site. Basically, everything will be ""ready to eat"". Fresh baked goods delivered every morning. Sides, salads, dips and other packaged items will be delivered maybe twice a week? My first bakery, and a separate bread bakery/kitchen, will operate as commissaries for the new location.

All staff will be trained to work the coffee side, make sandwiches, box/sell, etc. Probably in the 10 to 20 total employees. The GM will schedule, manage staff, and work with staff to order from the different vendors (internal and external). I'm thinking this person needs to be VERY proficient in either the kitchen or the coffee side of things. We can train them to be up to speed on the ""other"" side of things.

I would hire them 4 to 6 weeks prior to opening date. We'd get processes and procedures ironed out before we open. Use them to organize product, stock, plan soft openings, last minute interviews or hires, etc.

Benefits.... Right now, the only benefit we really offer is 2 weeks PTO for all employees (maybe 3 for this person). If this shop puts me over 15 to 20 employees, I will start looking for health coverage.",2,1744726812.0,restaurant,6,1.0,False

## What is Elyzia Acordis?

Elyzia Acordis is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users capitalize on market opportunities using smart algorithms and real-time data. Think of it like your own personal trading assistant—except it doesn’t sleep, doesn’t panic sell, and doesn’t charge you hourly fees.

It's kind of like if Robinhood and ChatGPT had a baby that was obsessed with trading. The platform claims it uses **AI-driven strategies** to analyze the markets and execute trades based on your preferences. Whether you're into Bitcoin, Ethereum, forex pairs, or even traditional stocks, Elyzia Acordis says it's got your back.

## Who Created Elyzia Acordis?

The creators of Elyzia Acordis haven’t been super public. There's no big-name founder like Elon Musk or Vitalik Buterin attached to it, which is pretty common for platforms in this space. But from what I could gather, it seems to be developed by a group of **fintech enthusiasts and developers** who have worked on similar platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge.

While anonymity might raise a few eyebrows, it's not necessarily a red flag. A lot of trading bots and platforms operate quietly in the background without celebrity endorsements or massive PR campaigns. Still, I’d love to see more transparency in the future.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Elyzia Acordis Today](https://tinyurl.com/8sap4vv5)
## How Does Elyzia Acordis Work?

At its core, Elyzia Acordis uses **automated trading algorithms** to scan the market for profitable trade setups. Once it finds a promising opportunity, it can either notify you or place the trade automatically, depending on your settings.

Here’s a basic rundown of how things work:

- You sign up and deposit a minimum of $250.
- The platform connects you to a broker (you don’t get to pick, but they seem legit).
- You can use the **demo account** to practice or go live with real money.
- The algorithm monitors the market and makes trades based on patterns, indicators, and historical data.

It's not magic, but it is **automation + analytics = faster trades**. Think of it like cruise control for your trading portfolio.

## Elyzia Acordis Pros and Cons

No platform is perfect, and Elyzia Acordis is no exception. Here’s my honest take:

### Pros:

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Elyzia Acordis?

The platform is **web-based**, so it works on pretty much anything with a browser. That includes:

- **Laptops** (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- **Smartphones** (iOS & Android)
- **Tablets**
- Even your smart fridge if it has Chrome (kidding… kind of)

There’s no dedicated app yet, but the mobile site is **optimized for touchscreens** and works surprisingly well.

## Elyzia Acordis – Supported Countries

Elyzia Acordis is available in most major countries, including:

- **United States**
- **Canada**
- **United Kingdom**
- **Australia**
- **Germany**
- **Italy**
- **South Africa**
- **India**

If you're in a country with strict crypto regulations (like China), you might have limited access, but for the majority of users—especially in North America and Europe—you're good to go.

## Elyzia Acordis – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

One of Elyzia Acordis' standout features is its **live market scanning**. It doesn’t just rely on old data—it’s constantly analyzing charts, trends, and signals to find optimal trading moments.

This is especially useful for crypto, where prices can swing wildly in minutes. Having an algorithm watching the market 24/7 is like having a caffeine-fueled intern who never sleeps.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is slick. You don’t need to be a Wall Street pro to understand what’s going on. Everything is laid out logically, and there's even a **guided walkthrough** when you first join. It's super beginner-friendly, but also robust enough for more experienced traders.

### Mobile Accessibility

No app download required. Just log in through your browser and you're in. The mobile experience is smooth, fast, and doesn’t feel like a watered-down version of desktop. I’ve checked trades while waiting for coffee. It’s that easy.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set **alerts** for specific price movements, trade executions, or market news. These notifications are actually useful and not spammy like some other platforms. Great for staying on top of things without being glued to your screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Elyzia Acordis isn’t just for crypto heads. You can also trade:

- **Forex pairs** (like EUR/USD)
- **Stocks** (like Tesla, Apple)
- **Commodities** (like gold, oil)
- **Cryptocurrencies** (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)

All from the same interface. This makes it a solid choice for people looking to diversify.

## Is Elyzia Acordis a Scam?

Not from what I’ve seen. The platform works, you can withdraw funds, and the brokers it connects you with seem legitimate. That said, it's **not regulated**, so it's not 100% risk-free.

But let’s be real—**all trading carries risk**, whether it's through your bank or an app. Elyzia Acordis seems to be a genuine tool that, when used responsibly, can help automate and improve your trading game.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Elyzia Acordis?

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard for platforms like this. It’s enough to get started without feeling like you’re throwing your life savings into the void.

You can deposit using:

- **Credit/Debit cards**
- **Bank Transfers**
- **E-wallets** (like Skrill or Neteller)
- **Crypto wallets** (BTC, ETH, etc.)

### Elyzia Acordis Customer Support

This was a surprisingly strong point. They offer **24/7 live chat**, plus email support. I tested both and got a quick, helpful response each time. No awkward bots or long wait times.

## How do you start trading on Elyzia Acordis?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Elyzia Acordis site and fill out the registration form. Takes less than 2 minutes. No credit card required.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once your account is created, you’ll be assigned a broker. Make your **$250 deposit** to unlock trading features. KYC verification is standard, so keep your ID handy.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either go **manual** or let the **auto-trading bot** take over. I recommend starting with the demo mode to get comfortable before risking real money.

## How to Delete an Elyzia Acordis Account?

If you decide it’s not for you, deleting your account is simple:

1. Contact support via chat or email.
2. Request account deletion.
3. Withdraw any remaining funds before closure.

They process it within a day or two, which is pretty fair.

## The Verdict

Elyzia Acordis is a solid, beginner-friendly trading platform with enough advanced tools to keep experienced users interested. The automation features, real-time market analysis, and clean interface make it stand out in a crowded space.

1jzsytn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1jzsytn/vc_or_bootstrap/,VC or Bootstrap?,"A friend shared this story over coffee, and it hasn’t left me since.

He raised $33M.
At one point, his startup was valued at $195M.
Over 100 employees. Impressive metrics. Big wins.

And yet—
When I saw him last week, his hands were shaking.

“Want to hear something scary?” he asked.

Here’s what he told me:
	•	$750K/month burn
	•	3 months of runway left
	•	Growth flatlined
	•	100+ families relying on him

“I haven’t slept in weeks,” he said.
Then he looked at me and said,
“Your 5-person company makes more profit than my entire team.”

He’s not alone.
There’s a generation of startups holding inflated valuations…
…with no clear path to profitability.

Meanwhile, quiet bootstrappers keep shipping, building, earning.

No funding hype.
No late-night board calls.
Just freedom.

This was from a friend’s post—but it’s a real choice many of us face.

To those who’ve raised or bootstrapped—what’s your take?
Would love to hear from folks on both sides.",1,1744726548.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

1jzsy8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jzsy8v/guys_paying_for_dates_it_actually_has_nothing_to/,guys paying for dates:  it actually has nothing to do with equality,"Paying for dates has nothing to do with equality, the guys who are trying to frame this in some kind of terms for leverage / transactional thing / financial state of genders (like that ""1950s"" post from yesterday) are missing the concept entirely.

As a guy, I pay for dates (unless she really wants to, that's awesome too of course, but I always lead with paying), and it's all about showing respect, affection, love languages, and courting rituals.

LTR's aren't just about romance, they also typically involve co-mingling finances, buying a house or renting together, maybe having kids.  Paying the bill for the first couple dates is just a simple way to take a baby step into showing you can operate as a team.   If you are too cheap to pay a $25 dinner tab (or $3 coffee if it's a coffee date), why would you expect to have any credibility that you are able and willing to help pay for a downpayment on a house or deposit on lease with her?   They key isn't the nuts and bolts of the finances, it's the teamwork that is involved, the willingness to enthusiastically act less autonomous and more as a partnership. 

But much more than the team side, it involves love languages and dating culture.   Many guys are just being tone deaf and failing to read the room. By refusing to pay, as a guy you are just shooting yourself in the foot and losing half your 2nd dates because you aren't properly courting and building affection with her.  

I often date progressive, feminist types of women, and most of them would get the ick if I didn't pay.  There is absolutely zero conflict in terms of things like feminism , tradwife / modern women etc (in the vast majority of cases) and paying for dates, it primarily has to do with love languages and courting.

When I go on a date, I'm treating her like my future wife.  I pay for friends' drinks and dinners (and vice versa) all the time, sometimes I even pay for beers for random dudes at bars who are funny.  Why would I not extend this courtesy to someone I want to build a life around?   It's really just another simple way to show interest and build affection, like a hug.  Don't overthink this! :)",52,1744726509.0,dating_advice,247,0.56,False

1jzsxgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/1jzsxgc/looking_for_a_gf/,Looking for a GF,"I am so tired of the OLD scene... I honestly thought maybe ranting would help. I am a 24M, in university. I haven't had a girlfriend before, I've had chances just timing stuff didn't allow for it to work out. I'm now really looking for someone, I am a very friendly person, I'm decent looking. I'm physically healthy and not overweight (recently have lost a bunch of weight and feels great). I get along really well with people and women especially. I just feel like I can't ask someone out in person because I don't want to make them or uncomfortable (I would accept a no) personally there's nothing that makes me like someone less than when I find out they don't like me. 

I have been trying the apps because it's a consensual space to find a partner, I even get some matches. But eventually, I either don't hear back from them, or we talk and they stop responding (I ask interesting questions about them). My standards are not very high either. All I want is someone that's not exceedingly overweight (I have put effort into getting myself in shape and I want a partner that supports me with this) I know it's shallow, but I like myself so much better and I feel so much better after losing weight. I just want someone that cares about that a little. Then I suppose I want someone I consider pretty, but I think I probably swipe right on about 60% of accounts I see on Hinge, and still my matches ghost or unmatch or something. I am a really respectful person, I never push for something physical or anything like that, in fact i actually prefer an emotional connection first.I am liberal, which is a plus around where I go to school. I am on the apps to find a long-term relationship. I would think that things like this would be positives for most women but it doesn't feel like it is.

 I have had several women friends my age, people that I would be interested in if they were on the apps look at my profile and asked for critical feedback. They had recommendations and I changed some things, which has helped but only a little. I go to class and am surrounded by couples, I don't understand how all these people meet, or how they managed to find someone that was interested in them. I just don't get it... I don't enter in person conversations with women with the sole intention of asking them out. But I have had people in classes that I ask for their Instagram and ask them to get coffee. That hasn't gone anywhere yet... I just feel like giving up, but I'm only 24, I feel like I still should have a chance. I just don't know. Anyone have any recommendations specific to Minneapolis about this?

1jzswkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1jzswkr/question/,Question,"Does anybody else have agoraphobia that progressively got worse the more anxiety you feel? Example, when I was 16 I used to be able to shop for my grandma in a grocery store alone (with a lot of anxiety.) Now 21 and exposing myself has only made my anxiety worse and I can’t even step into a dollar general alone let alone a large grocery store. Rather than my brain being like “hey, you survived this it’s okay” my brain was like “that was effing horrible let’s never do it again” I’ve been on medications since I was 14, stay hydrated, can’t eat well due to arfid, been in therapy, every day my routine is now drink coffee with my grandma who I live with and read Reddit and watch TikTok’s or tv shows with her, I like my solitude and have no interest in getting over this any time soon as I’m more comfortable in life than I’ve ever been, just being a hermit :) I skip coffee on days where I have appointments cause it just makes my panic attacks more prone to happen. Is this one of those things you just gotta force yourself to push past some day? I know I need to because I can’t live with her forever. I need to go to college someday or at least find a job but I feel stuck. Just wondering if anyone else experienced this as they got older.",2,1744726389.0,Agoraphobia,6,1.0,False
