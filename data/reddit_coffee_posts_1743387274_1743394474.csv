So I (F19) have been with my boyfriend (M21) for about 8 months. I am so in love with this man, and I truly believe that he’s made for me. He makes me laugh and is the truly the sweetest to me. However, he is also my first boyfriend, just to add that piece of information. 

Anyways, since we’ve been together, other than a couple minor hiccups, things have been smooth sailing. However, recently I’ve just had this growing worry that he’s been getting sick of me, and I can’t tell if I’m being dramatic or overthinking it.

I go to school about an hour away from our hometown, but I come back almost every weekend, and the weekends I don’t he comes up to visit me. So we see each other about once a week (usually no more than that unless it’s a break or something). So while it’s not a “long distance” relationship, there is several days in between us seeing each other. 

The past month has been pretty busy for both of us, but especially him, with work and school. Because of this, while we usually would see each other for several hours during our weekly dates and get all dressed up to go to a nearby city (like around 5 hours together), we have only been able to get coffee together for about an hour or two just to see each other. Also, even though this wasn’t an issue in the past, he’s been having longer hours at work that have been having him attend much earlier, so when I see him he’s either tired, or has to go to bed soon, which also has made our hangouts a little less “enjoyable”.

Despite this, we call often (around a couple times a week) and text each other nearly every hour of the day, so I’d say our communication makes up for this busy time. He’s really good at keeping me updated throughout the day. 

However, yesterday when we saw each other, something rubbed me the wrong way. So we got milkshakes together, and as we’re sitting I can tell he’s just really tired. And although I was enjoying our time together, idk, I just had this nagging feeling that I wasn’t being exciting enough or something (may be my anxiety, may be the actual truth, idk). But we spend a couple hours together, he’s being a gentlemen as always (he’s really good at this too), and he was also the one to ask to see me (because I was holding off on being the one to ask him if he was free just to “test my theory”), but usually he’s the one to ask anyways. 

ANYWAYS, eventually it’s getting late and time for me to go home, and he also just looks exhausted, so I’m thinking it’s time to call it a night for both of us. I go home, he texts me how nice it was to see me (I was also waiting for him to do this first) and I’m pretty content. 

Then about an hour after we both go home, he texts me that he’s heading to grab some food with his friends, and at this point it’s pretty late. Now, maybe I’m being dramatic. But the way he looked when I saw him, he looked exhausted. So I’m just wondering, was I just that boring?? Like idk, something about him seemingly not having the energy to spend time with me, but then heading out an after he got home to go see his friends, just made me feel not the greatest. 

I texted him to have fun though, and fell asleep just a bit sad, and I woke up the next day to his good morning and him texting me that he got home. 

I’ve sort of brought up this issue to him before, as there was one week I was back and didn’t see him as much as I could’ve hoped, and told him that I was a little sad about that, and had a feeling he was getting bored of me. He heavily denied this, but I don’t know, I just can’t shake off this feeling. On my end, I feel like nothings really wrong, he treats me right, communicates, and is just great—when I actually get to spend TIME with him. 

Another thing that has me worried, is we used to be a bit more intimate with each other, we’re both virgins, but you know, just do a bit more. But, we had a talk around 2 months ago (he brought it up) about wanting to tone it down a little and “save it” so we don’t go too far. Now this might come off as a red flag, but we’re Arab, and honeslty most of our culture is really strict, so I get this worry that he has of moving too fast, and although it may not make sense to some of you, the reason I’m bringing this up is for the next point: sometimes I can’t tell that him not kissing me or cuddling me as much is because of him trying to wait and restrain, or if he’s just not as attracted to me. On the one hand, he compliments me a lot, and really does make me feel beautiful. On the other, sometimes I just can’t shake off this feeling that something’s wrong. 

I don’t know. I’ve talked about it with him before, and asked him if he truly loves me, if he sees a future with me, if there’s anything wrong, etc. all of which he’s denied and attempted to make me feel better. But I just still have this urge to ASK but I don’t want to just constantly bring up this negativity and make him feel like what he’s doing or the love he’s shown me is not “good enough” or makes me feel loved enough. It’s just been a tough time and I can’t tell if I’m overthinking or if anything’s wrong. He promises that the next month will be better (we’ll both be out of school, and have month off until we start working), but I’m just struggling with this right now. 

Please let me know if I’m over thinking (I will genuinely take that as an answer) or if you see that something else might be wrong. ",1,1743394378.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1jnuw72,https://v.redd.it/du2zp1udayre1,My bottomless portafilter splashes coffee [Breville Barista Express] [Crema portafilter],"Hi, I recently bought a Crema bottomless portafilter for my Breville Barista Express but I’ve noticed that every time I make coffee it splashes everywhere, I’ve tried everything from grinding less grams, I started with 18g and tried 17g and 16.5g, I also tried different grinds from 3 to 8 to see if any of them wouldn’t do this and it always does, I also use a puckscreen, a tamper that always exerts the same pressure, WDT and a leveler.

It is important to clarify that in the video I was using a slightly coarser grind, but it was one of the many tests I did, but the only one I recorded. However, on all occasions it splashed.

I decided to try and break this up into a few manageable sections, but basically he gave me book as a gift that taught me what he was doing and why I was allowing it - and now, hes about to be homeless. 

# Chapter 1: First Meeting (2019-2021 Bogota and US)

\- On a trip to Bogota I met someone who I eventually fell in love. Ramses, with but one evening he introduced me to someone who always ""stood out"" for me - and I always noticed him in parties and clubs.

\- We spoke a few times on social media and he had made it very clear that he liked chatting with everyone but he did not want any kind of problems and I explained my bf knew that I chatted with some of his friends occasionally - normally about video games and very tame topics.

\- After 2 years, Ramses and I ended due to the pandemic and several months later, the guy, Xavier, reached out and we started talking

# Chapter 2: Reconnecting with Xavier (Cali and Charlotte)

\- I realized after 2 more years in NYC that I was extremely despondent and depressed - I had lost everything, my boyfriend, my mom to cancer, I had been laid off, my business failed and I had no home - I just moved through different airbnbs trying to find passion and just wasting away.

\- Xavier became someone I connected with during this time and while he had just returned to Cali, I decided to relocate to Charlotte where family lived

\- We were both kinda sharing how it was to move to a new place and I got a phenomenal job full remote paying a huge amount and Xavier had shared he had gotten a really great job too and we just kinda clicked

\- In 2023, we began to talk all the time - while first just sexual - I noticed I was actually growing fond of him and enjoyed our conversations a lot - I was also aware that he was kinda outta my league - he is objectively, very hot and was well known for being uh ""massive"" and from our conversations I could tell he was constantly getting attention - so him reaching out to me and spending so much time talking to me felt flattering. In contrast while Im not ugly, I am a bit on the chunkier side, have more of a potato body type and have no real big ""measurements""

# Chapter 3: Big Life Moves (Mexico and Charlotte)

\- By mid 2023 I began to grow very fond of him and though I had chatting with a few other guys too long distance he began to stand out and I could tell I was for him too

\- In August he told me he was going to relocate to Mexico City and have a new adventure, he also asked if Id be open to being boyfriends. This threw me off guard as I hadn't even considered it but he made a pretty direct and reasonable appeal - his other 4 boyfriends were colombians, every day a struggle, every day drama, not enough food and he decided he was done chasing butterflies and looking for the ""one"" and wanted to select someone who was responsible, financially solvent, kind and ambitious - while originally kinda turned off his proposal worked for me as he had simultaneously offered to help me some lights, set up and brand for my content. We made a deal - I would help with some of his housing during his trip and pay the first 3 months of rent.

\- While originally quite attentive and caring, I began to notice that our exchanges were primarily about him, his journey, his feelings - and the questions for me were about my day, what I was doing and where his next airbnb was going to be.

\- We got into our first nasty exchange when he I decided to treat him after getting a big bonus and got him a luxury hotel room in Cancun. While video chatting that night, the door rang and he told me had to go because he invited a guy over from Grindr who had just arrived.

\- We started to talk about respect and obviously we should be open about communication and he was confused - essentially asking if he thought we were monogamous and that he assumed I was having casual sex too - he reinforced he dint care as long as he didn't know about it and that nobody took propriety over him and I pointed out that I wasn't given the same courtesy as he had just announced someone arriving.

\- Though we reached some great heights for closeness, the end of the year showed me that this man had either changed, or was finally showing me who had always been but needed to hide. He was selfish, self-involved, egotistical and demanding. He could not communicate maturely, if I had a problem or was in a bad mood, that was on me to manage. Ironically I couldn't help but notice just how much hotter he was also getting. Ultimately he lost all my interest when I realized that aside from a few casual questions like ""how are you"" and ""how is your day"" he had zero interest in my life and whether or not I said ""everythings good"" or ""today I set the house on fire"" or ""I think my cat is dying"" his response was either ""que bien"" or ""que mal""

# - Chapter 4: New Beginnings (2023 Mexico and Charlotte)

\- Xavier ended up crossing a huge line with me the last week of December and essentially threatened to end things with me if I didn't send him 1000. He was also angry that we had promised to see other for Christmas and New Years but despite him asking about my plans, I had never confirmed anything and he didnt want to waste time. He didnt know I had already bought the tickets, booked a fancy ass hotel and had tickets for us for a cruise. I cancelled them all and gave away most of his gifts.

\- He reached out a few times apologizing and trying to explain that his family was really sick and how rude it was and he trusteed and counted on me but knew that he crossed a line and could we keep talking and trying. I gave him a few general responses, he sent me an angry email on Christmas about knowing I was a liar and that he knew I was talking to and paying other guys (I wasnt) and when I didnt respond again he sent me a note the first week of January telling me that he was happy for the experience and grateful for my support but no longer saw any point or purpose in us talking anymore.

Chapter 5: New Lows (Mexico and Charlotte)  
\- The first few months of 2024 were awful - I had made the mistake of continuing to watch Xaviers social media and every post was him looking incredibly handsome, happy, with new people in this new place and how grateful he was and was on his journey

\- Conversely, I was laid off from my job, lost all of my social media channels and my first business finally crashed. The last time I looked at Xaviers social media, he was posting at a mansion with a drink - and I was just served an eviction. I decided to just block him and focus on me and sold some bitcoin, got a bit lucky a few times and finally closed a very lucrative business contract

\- As the year ended I realized how miserable I was - I was so incredibly isolated and alone, I was depressed, I had just put my cat to sleep, I lived in a gross apartment that I never unpacked. I had put on so much weight that none of my clothes even fit me and finally October 31st I decided to whip myself into shape - and made the decision to not renew the lease and instead find a new place to live and use 2025 to focus on my self, my health and launching my business so I could finally leave this boring ass town and go live again

# Chapter 5: Should've Blocked Your Ass

\- Middle of November I get a strange text, I thought it was one of my old friends but realized it was Xavier. He sent me PAGES of his story, at how he never forgot me and how my support had been the greatest gift he ever got and while he knew he fucked up he always considered me his ""real boyfriend"" and had been secretly planning to arrive in the US to surprise me. I say nothing until he gets to the point, he needs a hotel that night. I laughed so hard - I found one for 20 bucks and told him it was closing in 33 minutes so he needed to check in now. He responded be showing me videos of him eating tacos and how starving he was.

\- He arrived too late and couldn't enter. I turned off my phone when I saw his texts and calls asking for help with a new space.

\- He eventually arrives in the US and his plans fall through - I blocked him already but he reached out to a mutual friend and begged me to help him. He was in his last night of a shelter, had been robbed twice, had literally nothing and he was about to lose his bed. That day I had again won a huge contract and money was not an issue for me. I relented and got him a hotel reservation because his friend begged me saying he knew that Xavier had fucked with me but he couldn't imagine his friend on the street and that he would pay me back. 

\- Xavier and I start talking and we fall back into our old patterns and despite everything I know about this man, he gets me into the same situation but this time hes actually more aggressive and demanding and less grateful - like twice he asked me to order food for him, and I did, but it took too long and he got ""bored"" and went to hang out with friends. Two different times I can tell hes baiting for a reaction by sending me a picture of himself with a handsome guy waving - I think about it and realize I dont really feel romantic vibes - I am still sexually attracted to him, and he has a huge allure in addition to wanting to resolve some of the horrible things that had happened, but I dont feel jealous. 

\- We eventually talk - I dont want to engage in this again, I feel bad that his housing and job fell through and while I dont wish harm, we also have some unresolved conflicts that Im still not liking. He keeps flirting and also hinting that I can just fly him to Charlotte and I think about it. We talk and talk and talk and eventually we come to a decision. Im moving anyway and the house Im moving into is actually 3 rooms. He can stay with me for 3 months. I pay rent, food utilities, he works for 75% of that and I give him the other 25% in cash. He cooks and does light cleaning. If it works well, we can extended a few more months and after I launch my business, I commit to helping him with his. He was overjoyed

\- Though I tell him we have to wait until the end of Feb as I had just started house hunting, he pushes and pushes and guilts me to letting him arrive early and hell just stay with me at Airbnb's until we find a place. The night before he arrives, he leaves me the sweetest video message Ive ever gotten at how excited he was and how he was going to show me he was different from anyone else, that we were going to be incredible together - that he cant wait to kiss and laugh and fuck and eat and dance and party and just how grateful he was that this worked and how this was absolutely his destiny to land with me. He asked me at that point if I felt anything more than just friendship and I honestly said no, but we could talk about it live. 

\- The night he arrives I cant fucking believe it - despite what happened after, it was probably my favorite memory of 2025.  The whole experience of seeing someone who you not only built such history with digitally but had deep emotional tags and just seeing who he was live and how he looked and what was diferent from photos and videos to live, and how happy he was. The next day I remember thinking 'this was the best decision I ever made"" as we caught up for a few hours and despite how cold and emotionless Ive known him to be, hes literally sobbing saying hes ""home"" and thanking me for my patience, for not giving up on him, for never being petty after he treated me like an asshole etc 

# Chapter 6 - It Can Always Get Worse

\- The good feelings wore off in a few days. Not only is this a very entitled strong willed person who is used to commanding and manipulating people, taking over the whole house, deliberately pushing boundaries to get a reaction, I went from being completely isolated and being quite content with it to having someone in my space all day every day, blasting tv and music who constantly needed stimulation. 

\- We bring up the boyfriend topic and I tell him its flattering but I dont feel the same way he does - I need to see how we handle each other.. The good times are easy - but how do we handle conflict, stress, aggravation, sensitive topics etc. He is disappointed but agrees but also says hes not looking to be fucked with and several people have asked him to start a relationship but he always said he already had someone so if after 2 weeks, I didnt make up my mind he would stay here and do what we agreed, but wanted me to know hed consider himself single 

\- Over three more AirbNb I began to think this was a mistake. I began to get super self conscious and insecure despite him telling me that even though Im bigger than last time, Im still hot - we had sex once in the first airbnb and then never again. Despite the fact that most of our digital exchanges were him modeling hot underwear that I loved and him enjoying it - in person I barely see it and a month goes by where we basically dont do anything physical. I notice he had sudden mood changes, gets aggravated on a dime and enjoys just being a dick. Like having a conversation and If I say something he doesn't like, he just gets up and walks to his room, slams the door and blasts music. And 5 hours later comes into my room while im working to tell me to come watch this new yotube video and also to order food

\- Something else that I still dont understand is he began suffering from...something. Not physical but he was absolutely positive one of his old clients was tracking him and fucking with him and his family and he began to suspect and accuse me of being part of it

\- I have no idea what we are, we have sex twice and sleep together twice and we move into the new house and instead of sharing my bed, he elects to sleep on the sofa in the living room. The only conversations we have is him asking me when we are buying furniture and that he needs to send money to his mom and sister

\- We agree on a work contract and then he decides hes not interested - he went back on everything and said he wasn't here to help my dream, he was here for his. I reminded him that we were both going to help each other and he basically just shrugged/

\- Every week my patience was tested and every day I got more and more miserable - but each time I was at my wits end, I would remind myself I made a promise t him, I want to make this work, this can work, were just in the new getting to know each other phase, hes gotta feel really uncomfortable being all alone in Charlotte while I work all day, without friends or people to talk to other than me, and were pretty sick of each other.

\- Fights continue to escalate as he keeps pushing boundaries (taking my computer while I was sleeping, insisting on closing my office door because he thinks im recording and deciding to move furniture pieces into his room) and he finally snaps and destroys his bathroom shower door (it was faulty, but I had already filed a ticket - in his frustration he just ripped it completely off. When I didnt give him the reaction he wanted, he tossed them in front of my door)

\- The next day he wanted to have a ""talk"" and I couldn't believe the depths of his manipulation attempt. He was so self involved, so impressed with his own intelligence that he never understood that im an organizational design scientist who has studied human behavior for 20 years for corporations. Every tactic he tried was amateur and he had no idea I was just playing along trying to get to a spot where he could just be comfortable. He gave me a huge lecture that I was his destination, that he dreamed of me and how excited he was to cross into the US, but that I was so boring with nothing to offer, all I did was work and sleep, he knew I was doing recreational drugs, he knew I was talking to other guys (I wasnt) and that Im not the good person he thought he was. That the idea of us being boyfriends was a huge turn off and that over the last month he saw me as nothing more than a friend at best. I responded saying ""well, I know im a goof friend to you, but what qualities do you have that show your a good friend to me?""

\- Enraged he basically said we could just be roommates then but he needed 500 immediately and he couldn't believe how cruel I was that I knew he hadn't washed his laundry since we moved in (i reminded him Im not his keeper and he didn't want to work) I told him this was the last time I was ""giving"" him money and that this 500 needed to be worked off. He agreed

\- After two weird nights that we strangely reconnected, last weekend he had another fit and was sure I had done something to his laptop. After 2 more days of the yelling, the bad moods, the accusations, the selfishness and just the sheer exhaustion I felt - I made the decision he needed to go. I went to my room and thought about how we could talk the next day, he could work for me for 3 weeks - I had 3 huge payments coming and to keep things positive if he could complete what he agreed, I would give him enough of a wad of cash to get started and buy a one way plane ticket.

\- Sadly he decided to come into my room to pick another fight with me and at a certain point I just laughed and said ""how...did you manage to ruin all of this so quick?""

\- Filled with pride and fury he packed his bags and 20 minutes later his Uber appeared. He shouted as he left ""thank you for everything, I appreciate what you tried to do""

# Chapter 7 - The Final Night 

\- I was sure he would come back but after a few days I began to realize maybe he had been planning on leaving already - I had known from his trip from Mexico to the US that his big thing was ""Always forward"" - once he left a situation he was completely done with it and saw no reason to revisit it. I struggled so much at feeling used, betrayed, hurt, angry, lonely isolated - it was easy to live alone in my old apartment, because it was all mine and I had tons of experiences there. Everything about this house had him attached to it

\- I finally realized what I to do and finally went into his room - it was again so surreal feeling parts of his ""presence"" and trying to make sense of everything that had happened since the first night we met at that bar to me actively despising him.

\- I realized as I packed everything that he had intentionally left everything that was us. All of the clothes I bought him, some sex toys, his shaving kit, the candles I got him, a book I gifted him, even the socks and t shirts I bought. There wasn't a single item in the room that wasn't related to our tome together, and I noticed the same for his bathroom.

\- One thing I noticed was he had gotten me a gift - my birthday is in a few weeks and at the very back of the closet was a small giftback with a note - he had filled it out last month and I guess he was waiting. All the card said was 'this book changed my life, I hope it does for you too.""

# Chapter 8 - Stop Being Yourself

\- I finally sat down with the book and within hours realized this was the best gift he could've ever given me. It helped me understand everything, why I had made this terrible bond with him, why I felt so compelled to do what he wanted even though he didn't deserve it, it wasn't Xavier I was valuing - it was what he represented. Freedom, acceptance in gay world, these world adventures that he just did and lands in a new place and wreaks havoc and leaves behind a wake of problems but thats not his problem, thats yours. But it was that journeying, the travel and the love of life that I was missing and what he represented -  it was being confident and attractive and loving new experiences - and no matter how much money I gave him or how much I catered to him or how much I allowed him to disrespect me,  I had enabled this. 

\- For days I had sat down in his room and read every text message between us and videos he had sent each other - not being able to believe how lovely and kind and wonderful he was even 2 days before he landed to the fucking horror he became. I began to really look forward to when he came crawling back and I would take back the power, but the book helped me again - that was my ego, that was lashing out

 \- I didnt give him any power without my permission. Why would I want him back? We wasted 2 months with this bullshit and I have goals to do and a business to launch. I looked at his old folder and the text messages where he was the kindest and one of my favorite times with how much he was laughing and several of his hottest underwear videos he sent me and I realized - I no longer had attraction to him either. Remembering having sex, seeing the few pairs of underwear he left behind just ....bored me and I deleted everything that is attached to him from my phone. Thank you also for that lesson Xavier, lets focus on the present. 

\- For days, I knew he would contact me, I knew he had limited resources and we both knew I would help - and the childish part of me couldn't wait to shove it in his face and reclaim things and be distant and slow to respond - and then I just  I realized I never needed him to see my value, I needed to remember it myself and when I did I remembered who the FUCK I was. How I crossed South America in 7 months, how I was kind and generous and loved to read and write - that I played saxophone and video games and enjoyed photography, how I love autumn and chess and Im a fucking catch. Sure Ill keep focusing on losing weight (already down 74 lbs!) but this guy not seeing it, taking advantage of me at every opportunity and not realizing he would give me the very tool I needed to put an end to it - well thats his problem. My problem, my concern, my only focus is me, what I want, what I need and what I will do and now I realize this man no longer serves me. There will be no final email, no nostalgie for the old days, no practicing conversations in my head, no talking about him to others. I watch video after video about stoicism and time and saw how easily I had let him manipulate and that the only thing he gets now is silence. I dont care if he calls, I dont care if he begs, I dont care if he messages me - any second more than what Ive spent is time away from me, what I want and what I need. 

# Chapter 9- I can't use the ""K"" word, but when life immediately hands you the equal action of what you did. 

\- After one week I finally had thrown out everything - i realized a childish portion of me was holding on to a few sentimental items and what became a few boxes became a box became a bag became 3 small things - I will throw them out shortly. Ive moved around all the furniture and even delighted in trashing his stupid coffee machine, knife set and all of the food he left in the fridge. I redecorated the pictures and art and today I spent several hours in my new study planning all of my next steps

\- Interestingly enough, one of our last civil conversations was about how he wanted to do everything with love and productivity and despite having enemies, he just sat back and enjoyed the k word to do its part -  and he was basically implying  he knew that I was against him, that he knew I was trying to control him and that he was my enemy and he just smirked at me saying ""dont worry, k\_rms coming"" it was indeed

\- I decided that though a part of me wanted the inevitable ""hey im sorry, can you help me or buy me a ticket back"" - I began to realize and accept I didnt want him back. There was literally no value he brought me and I blocked him on everything

\- Yesterday one of his friends called me to tell me he had arrived back in Miami, banging on the door at 3am. He wouldn't talk about what happened but just said I was so boring and he needed a new start and to live alone. His friends reminded him he had no resources and expressed that once he left he never contacted them again and they didnt appreciate being used only when he needed something and gave him 3 days to find new arrangements. 

\- Yesterday night he unblocked to text me. Bear in mind it's been 2 weeks since he left and all it says was ""Hey, listen I need a favor - I need an airbnb for a week. Im going to use your PayPal account, okay"" I had already changed all my passwords and saw he had attempted it, I told him I was glad he was safe, but no he could not use my paypal account. Ooh, I could tell he didnt like that and he thought the denial meant I didnt have enough and he wrote back ""Oh, dont worry - I realize you cant afford it or me anyway - dont worry, Ill find someone who can""

\- Today I got 11 calls from a new number that eventually started texting and leaving me messages. I made the mistake of answering it thinking it was the bathroom door guy - but no, it was him. N0 greeting, no apology, no sorry about. all that, just a ""i really need you to book me an airbnb only for a week"" and I just sat and listened and ....I dont recognize the man anymore that would say yes to this. I was already annoyed that he had taken up this time of mine, so I made it super clear ""hey, sorry - wish you the best of luck, and I hope the best for you - but Im done helping you, Im done with all of this. You made the decisions to leave you destroyed everything with your actions. I hope your well, but no - I am done, you are not my responsibility"" - he began to get angry, even saying ""but you promised - when i got to charlotte you said you would always help me, when I left that night you said to call if you needed anything"" and I said ""I did say those things, and you also said a lot of things that probably were true when you said them, but over time you realize it just doesn't serve you anymore, I have no more favors to give you. And again he pleaded insisting this would be the last one, and I just said ""actually - thats for me to decide, and Ive made up my mind"" and for the first time in our entire history, I hung up on him.

\- He texted me again, all him just saying he didnt even need me to pay for it, he just needed it for the deposit and he was going to pay the balance with one of his other cards. I put it on silent.

\- I worked all day and finally looked at my phone. Hes called me 42 times from this new number and left a 2 minute voicemail - there was a tiny part of me that could almost feel bad, wondering if he was going to be sobbing or begging - but no, hes still suffering the delusion that I am the same man I was. He went into a whole spiel about how he knew things weren't working out between us, he wanted to move back to a bigger city, he really needed to focus on working and building his life and he had wasted 2 months doing jackshit with me (again remember he insisted on flying in early before I had housing), but he couldn't find any place and had no resources - he was at a guys house and could spend the weekend but it was really dirty and please, hell never ask me for anything again - can I just book him an airbnb for one week so he can have some personal time to himself to destress, and think and calm down and maybe we can start talking again later because he knew he hadn't been great but to ""let him know"" - and the last 3 seconds he said ""oh, and sorry for everything that happened""

\- I will block this number and delete that voice mail shortly - Im trying really hard to not give into Schandenfraud - but a big part of me has a huge intuition that his next few weeks - months are not going to be easy....but they will be necessary. One of his last comments was that if I dont help him, he will have to go on the streets and ....thats just not my problem anymore. 

I am sad for what he will experience, and truly I dont want him to suffer - but I feel so free realizing this is simply no longer my problem.",2,1743394147.0,CongratsLikeImFive,0,1.0,False

I got me a Flair 58+ 2.. I have a DF83V on a boat at the moment coming to me.. For now I am using a Zpresso K-Ultra for my espresso with a Flair Power Tower.. It's cool, not perfect..

Im looking for a machine that I can tinker with and make great espresso, but also faster.. Im currently looking at the Meraki and the Wendougee Data S and open to suggestions besides those.. I got the puck prep down and I understand a good grind is key.. Im good on those.. I don't want to buy the meraki and a 1/3 of the machine is useless to me.. Id rather put that portion towards a better machine if I can...

Meraki, I just dont need the grinder.. Though the features are pretty cool.. I would change my mind if someone knows of an alternative that has similar features.. Rotary or Gear Pump, Cool touch wand, pre-infusion, some extra perks a welcome, etc..

The Wendougee Data S is very tempting.. I would love a descent, but the bengle is unknown release date.. Plus.. Umm.. $6k.. Im hoping the Wendougee has similar features, but is too new for a real review.. Im wondering if it would be a step towards the Descent and its features.. Im not a coffee nerd, but it would be nice to future proof a little and get a view into the future and play with it.. Maybe will become one, but time to do it is questionable..

The Specialty Coffee Expo is on April 25th.. I know that Lance Hendrick was talking about a secret Breville Project and I am wondering how thats coming along... I noticed the Breville Dual Boiler is slimming in availability and I am wondering if they are working on something cool.. Maybe a new release.. I can't find any hints of one though.. Its killing me, but then when would they release it? Oracle released after announcement in September I think?

If you guys have any ideas.. $3500 shipped is where I may have to draw the line unless something amazing pops up, but ehhh..

I would like a little future proof, solid features like the ones I listed above.. Im new to the espresso, done a bunch of research, but it's so vast and so much info, that I am overwhelmed.. There is so many critics and pumps for every thing out there, it's hard to believe what's real and what is bs...

Hello :) I'd love to meet someone and see where it takes us <3

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_A little about me !\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\- From NewYork, but live in Pennsylvania now, it's pretty nice out here though! The woods are peaceful to me now.

\- Hopefully soon I'd like to start going hiking and maybe even camping? I've never been an outdoorsy person so this is super new for me and its really exciting! outside the bears and idk maybe wolves? I really hope they aren't out here lol.

\- I'm still pretty new to it but, I've picked up Miniature painting from things like Warhammer and Etsy. It's been really peaceful. I haven't painted a ton before and I've got no experience buuut I have a few finished pieces I'm proud of and can't wait to get more <3 And a designated painting area.

\- I think overall I'm kind of relaxed and introverted. I like to just have fun with my friends in my freetime, relax and take it easy. Whether that be gaming with the bois, painting miniatures, trying to practice pixel art, or completely shutting off my brain :D

\- Some of my interests are : Gaming ( League, Valheim, Lethal Company, Minecraft and Marvel Rivals sometimes.. That game hurts my soul and saps my braincells everytime I launch it) I'm also obsessed with coffee and dinosaurs! I have a new espresso machine I can't wait to try out soon :) A few more days! And I also plan on getting a full sleeve tattoo someday. A mix of dinosaurs and other stuff that's important to me. So many big big goals.

\- Love horror movies. Zombies scare me though..  My favorite movies are : A Quiet Place and Lord of the Rings. I love Supernatural that's such a good show. But I wish there was more hunting in it and less about angels :(

\- Recently started working on my wardrobe. I'm pretty comfortable in what I'm wearing now and I think I'm a whole snack. I'm 6ft tall, have dark brown hair and brown eyes. A beard and I wear glasses but Im getting new ones soon! And I'm addicted to turtle neck sweaters now, they're so nice and comfy..

*All quotations and characters names from* [*Internet Archive Maude*](https://archive.org/details/anna-karenina-tolstoy-leo-graf-1828-1910/page/253/mode/1up).

Summary courtesy u/Honest_Ad_2157: The Shcherbatskys are taking the waters. Tolstoy chooses a natural image, the formation of a snowflake, to describe the positioning of each new arrival to the watering-place into a place in the Social matrix.† Kitty, though she’s well-greeted by a “real” German princess, is dissatisfied with everyone in her circle, creating fantasies about the strangers she sees, until Madame Stahl and her companion, Varenka, arrives. Varenka is just so damn nice, helping the needy, that her character reads like a setup to a modern heist movie. Now Kitty is crushing hard on Varenka, and it appears it could be requited *if they’d just talk to one another instead of just making eyes at one another.* Prince Papa disappears to Carlsbad and Nicholas Levin and Mary Nikolavna arrive, bringing bad vibes to Kitty.

† The natural metaphor for society leaderboard: Bees 2, Snowflakes 1

* Unnamed “real” German Furstin, Princess

Please see the [in-development character index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbGn60f8tRX_xC2d87RFjDuAR3p0lZCjEyxDDCepCSw/edit?usp=sharing), a tab in the [reading schedule document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbGn60f8tRX_xC2d87RFjDuAR3p0lZCjEyxDDCepCSw/edit?usp=sharing), which has each character’s names, first mentions, introductions, subsequent mentions, and significant relationships.

**Prompts**

1. Anna was portrayed as consuming “English novels” in Part 1, which from their description seem to be romance novels, and Kitty makes them up in her head about the people she doesn’t know because she’s bored with those she does know. What’s going on?
2. What impression did Varenka make on you? (War and Peace reference: >! She sounds a lot like Sonya in War and Peace, doesn’t she? Does Tolstoy have a few source archetypes, or what?!<) What do you think about the interaction between Kitty and Varenka? Does it have anything to do with what Kitty’s up to in prompt 1?

I don’t necessarily agree with all of it, but it’s a fair interpretation of Kitty’s development in the novel. You don’t need to be up on your Kierkegaard, but it might help. I note that the Cambridge Companion mentions that Tolstoy started reading Kierkegaard (in Russian translation by P Hansen) a dozen years after the publication of Anna Karenina, on April 1-6, 1890. This is before Tolstoy began his work that apparently incorporates three life phases, *The Kingdom of God is Within You,* in 1891.



**Final Line**

>It seemed to her that his large, dreadful eyes, which followed her insistently, expressed hatred and irony, and she tried to avoid encountering him.

## What counts as a dupe?

* A perfume that smells ""just like"" another perfume - whether discontinued or priced out of budget

  * Example: ""looking for a dupe of BR540 Extrait, but without the price tag""

  * Example: ""something that smells ***just like*** Coffee Break, but lasts longer""

  * Example: “a dupe for the discontinued Elizabeth & James Nirvana Black”

 * A perfume version of **any product**: body sprays, hair products, lotions / creams, skin care, candles, candy / sweets, makeup, etc.


## How it works:

Share as many details as possible that might be helpful in identifying the dupe you're after: a picture, notes or scent profile, your general geographic location, budget, etc. Please do a quick search of the sub before adding your request, even if you think it would be unusual.

Please remember that this is a global sub with quite a bit of volume, so a response may take time. This thread refreshes weekly on Mondays at 05:00 UTC, so keep that in mind when posting.

Quit coffee cause i had paranoia and... uh yeah but now(again lol) I'm worried there was some sort of drugs in the food or water i consumed but none of it totally makes sense cause theres no way others wouldnt notice it or smell it and there would be 

Possibly something I consumed alot like caffeine acted like a chemical that stopped said drug from affecting you and yeah some substances do that but it doesn't seem actually possible

And.... everyone else in the house seems fine?  Only issues are right now is that I think I might be hearing things but its likely fine probs not actually hearing things. (ok-ish sleep and no all nighters nor much stress at all).

In my area if your not on somekind of level gold, silver, platinum. You won’t get much worth anything and still get crap. Especially if your close to the 70% mark. So Saturday I’m at 70% and just denied Chick-Fil-A for 2 miles at $2.75. I get this Bob Evans for double pickup for 6 miles and I was 3 miles away so total of 9 miles for $6.00.  I tried to deny but I would have list Gold status. My lord it would have taken probably 10 crappy orders over 4-hours to regain said status. I took the deal. I was only on DD as Uber was extremely slow. As DD lately has been just plain bad. Then I look at the receipts. I’m like WTF! DD is making $12.00 out of the almost $19.00 paid between the two customers. I’m getting $6.00? I was done for the day after this with DD. I have no clue what was tip or fee but don’t care. They inflate the food price about a dollar or more per item and then the customer pays a huge amount for delivery and I hot $3.00 per delivery on this. Not kool. 

Again, in my area cherry picking is worthless. Tried it, got burned. Got sick of the AR slave movement once it was back up and then got a one star and no basis and DD couldn’t tell me why or remove it. Moved to Uber and use DD as a filler for slow times.

I got the job as a Catering Manager at a college in Jan 2023, but due to the pandemic having just happened and things still being on the upswing I was the ONLY one in the department and it was a WRECK.  The managerial team was a team of 4, including myself, but I was the only woman.  I could tell from the start it was very much a boys club, but thought it wouldn’t be so bad as I knew the Exec Chef - he had gotten married to my previous boss of 8 years (who I was still friends with, and knew like all of her family and also worked with, and she had given me a referral).  

After the 1st double standard I saw where I was told “we don’t speak to other managers without the a 3rd manager being there so it’s not a “he said, she said”” and then it happened anyway with me, I should have seen the red flags, but it took months of the Exec chef doing shady shit behind my back (not responding to emails to set up things for events, not getting together with me for important events to go over display ware and than saying he knew nothing about it even though I’d emailed him 3 times that previous week and spoke to him twice in person). 

 THe day before the event he had his kitchen staff plating things up on crappy wooden stuff when our District Manager had specifically said “use glass” ”you guys need to decide what we have and if we need to buy more” which is what I had been trying to do with all the emails I had been sending. Who didn’t I tell my district manager you ask? Bc he was away on a week vacation when this whole thing went off.

Then my favorite part. I arrive that morning and I’m there a total of a minute, I had gone up the elevator and this man is screaming at me…WHY? Bc I had the audacity not to have the coffee all ready to go (like open and in the filters) Mind you the coffee and filters are kept RIGHT under the machines.  (again keep in mind I’m the only one in this department, I had been setting all of the events up (in another building across campus) by myself AND because the department of catering had been left SUCH a mess I had been collecting and reorganizing things so they would be easier to find.  

Because of the coffee thing treated me like shit the rest of the day.  The day the event went off, I’m left over at the event the whole day, switching things out (we had breakfast, snack, lunch, snack), and then the exec chef leaves me and 1 other person to clean it all up for 50 people.  Not even paper ware that can be thrown away.  Glass.  He took the truck, so we had to go get that first, and he hadn’t hired a dishwasher so there was no place to put this all when we got back.    


After this whole event, he took a 3 week trip to Alaska, and the district manager came back.  Apparently before he had left the chef had sent an email about my “misconduct” that day and I got a talking to and the manager had the audacity to ask me if I ever considered if I was ADHD. The whole thing gave me the ick, as I tried to explain my side of what happened and basically was told “why didn’t you say something sooner?” Like “The fuck?” You mean when you were on vacation? Or when I was told that it didn’t need to be done right now?  

I had considered I was ADHD, but it had never interfered with my work or my life (or so I thought) so I never saw a doctor for it.  1/?",1,1743392850.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

1jnug1n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jnug1n,First times update!!,"I posted a few weeks ago about my first time developing and scanning film. I took a free workshop series at my local community darkroom and tonight was learning to use enlargers and basics of printing. We didn't fiddle around with prints as it was only 3 hours and multiple people so not time to get fancy, but so we all got basics and one to take home. Learned test prints, figuring out settings and education on contrast filters (didn't use), and got to make my first print. This was my first self developed negative, first scan, and first print! We used a coffee home made development solution for all steps developing and printing, so that's why the tint, not chemically tinted in the way i see people do.

1jnuc3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1jnuc3p/today_i_saw_a_ghost/,"Today, I saw a ghost","Today was a very complicated day. 

I started the day feeling proud of myself because I didn’t check my ex pwBPD’s Instagram profile or her story like I sometimes do even though I don’t follow her anymore (I know, not healthy). 

I was feeling energized, like my life was moving forward, because last night I went on a great date with a new woman I’ve been hanging out with. The positive momentum of that night was carrying over into the morning, and gave me the right kind of confidence to actively not care about my ex’s Instagram. Win! 

I got ready for the day because I had plans to go on a casual day date with a different girl I’ve also been hanging out with. We met up, got some coffee, went on a great 10k step hike, and then decided to get some lunch. The day date was also going well with this girl. Win! 

After lunch, we decided to head into town to do some window shopping. And then as we were walking, not more than 10 ft. in front of me is my ex doing some shopping as well. 

Gulp. 

Well, we were walking behind her, so she wouldn’t have been able to see us if we didn’t actively pass her. After a tense 15 seconds of walking behind her she popped into a store, and we continued on walking. I don’t think she ended up seeing me with my date. 

I have never felt that type of feeling before. It literally felt like seeing a ghost. Afterwards I had complicated feelings of wishing my ex saw me with the new girl I’ve been hanging out with, and also feeling thankful that she didn’t see us. 

I’m not scared of my ex pwBPD as a person. I feel like I’ve really been trying hard to move my life forward from the pain of our breakup, but the way the universe conspired to place her physical body in front of me (especially after I’ve been working hard in NC) felt more than coincidental. 

It felt like such a surreal test, and I don’t really know if I passed or failed. On the one hand, I navigated through the moment, and successfully avoided a potentially awkward situation. Pass? On the other, the fact that me seeing this person in public created such a high level of anxiety and rumination tells I have a lot more healing to do. Fail? 

Any thoughts are welcome…

If you got this far, apologies for the long rant.

For the last 5 days or so days I've had pain in the right side of my abdomen. It range from no pain at all most of the time, to slight discomfort to sudden and sharp pain. The last time I felt pain was tonight when I had a beer, but I've had pain without drinking and a couple of days ago I had a few beers and felt no pain at all. My alcohol intake is overall average for a university student, although since New Year I've only drank beer, averaging to about a couple of beers with friends 2 or 3 times a week. I live an overall unhealthy lifestyle eating lots of fatty food, but I'm on the skinnier side with my GP noting that I've become of normal weight during my check-up this summer. The check-up also included a blood test that found no abnormalities whatsoever. I also drink lots of fizzy drinks, mainly Coke, having about 3-4 a day since I don't drink coffee, with coke specifically causing inflammation for the last couple of days and no other drinks containing sugar doing so. Usually I'm not active in my personal life and spend it hunched over a computer(literally as my table and honestly most furniture is too short for me) but I'm usually active enough in my work/studies, which is related to stage acting, although less so since New Years due to decreased amount of rehearsals. I also don't own a car and prefer to walk everywhere. I have no jaundice but I do have dry mouth since yesterday. 

My question is should I seek medical treatment or is this something that will go away on it's own because I have a rehearsal on Tuesday where I'm also the movement particioner so it will be hard to skip and I have a performance today and on Thursday, which are also hard to skip since there is nobody to replace me.",1,1743392266.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

**Genre**: Romance/Drama  
**Setting**: High School, Small Town

# Act 1: Introduction

* **Scene 1: Meet Iris Jacobs** The film opens with Iris Jacobs, a rebellious, witty troublemaker who has a knack for getting into minor skirmishes but excels in her studies. Iris is often seen in the school courtyard sketching, where her artistic talents shine despite her chaotic nature. Although she’s popular among her classmates for her bold attitude and good grades, she’s usually alone, except for her close-knit group of friends: Evelyn Lee, Erin Fionn, Vivian Johnson, and Nick Miller. Nick, her childhood friend, stands by her through thick and thin, always trying to calm her when her rebellious streak gets her in trouble.
* **Scene 2: Meet Marcus Gomez** Marcus Gomez is the high school heartthrob: popular, athletic, and charming. He’s admired by everyone, but despite his widespread popularity, Marcus feels isolated and disconnected. He’s friends with Jason Smith, Zander Jeans, and Aiden Wilson—guys who often act as his “crew,” but Marcus struggles with a deep emptiness. He has a strained relationship with his family and often hides behind his charming persona. Nick is not a part of Marcus’s social circle, but they do cross paths occasionally.
* **Scene 3: The Bet** One day, Marcus’s friends—Jason, Zander, and Aiden—make a bet: they challenge Marcus to make Iris fall in love with him. They believe that it’ll be an easy task since she’s outspoken and rebellious, and they assume she’ll fall for Marcus’s charm. Initially hesitant, Marcus agrees, not realizing the emotional consequences that would unfold. His motivation is superficial, and he doesn’t take into account the impact this could have on Iris.

# Act 2: The First Encounter

* **Scene 4: The Icebreaker** Marcus approaches Iris while she’s sketching in the courtyard. Their conversation is awkward, as Iris immediately suspects there’s more to his sudden interest than meets the eye. Marcus compliments her art, attempting to break the ice, but Iris is defensive, skeptical about his true intentions. Despite her reservations, she’s intrigued by him, though she’s not sure if it’s because of his popularity or if he’s genuinely interested in her.
* **Scene 5: Iris’s Life at School** Iris continues her day, dealing with both the usual chaos she creates and the bullying from Harper Lopez, who constantly mocks her for being different. Thankfully, Iris’s friends—Evelyn, Erin, Vivian, and Nick—always have her back. Nick, especially, is there to pull her out of trouble when things get too heated. He’s concerned about her reckless behavior but supports her because he knows that Iris is more than her tough exterior.

# Act 3: The Growing Bond

* **Scene 6: A Secret Connection** As Marcus continues to interact with Iris, he finds himself genuinely drawn to her. He starts seeking out moments to talk to her, offering to help with her schoolwork or simply to chat about art, something Iris is passionate about. Slowly, Marcus begins to see Iris’s vulnerabilities and intelligence beyond her rebellious nature, and he starts to fall for her. Iris, in turn, opens up, finding herself drawn to his charm and sincerity—although she still has doubts about his intentions.
* **Scene 7: The First Date** Marcus invites Iris to a diner under the pretense of just hanging out. Iris is hesitant, unsure why someone like Marcus would want to spend time with someone like her. However, they have a surprisingly enjoyable evening, and Iris starts feeling something more for him. She tries to brush off her feelings, unsure if she’s falling for the real Marcus or just his popular persona.

# Act 4: The Discovery

* **Scene 8: Iris Overhears the Bet** One afternoon, Iris overhears Marcus and his friends laughing about the bet. Her heart sinks as she realizes that everything Marcus has been doing—the flirtation, the attention, the kindness—was part of a cruel game. She feels humiliated and betrayed, confronting Marcus immediately. Marcus tries to apologize, but Iris, deeply hurt, brushes him off, refusing to listen. She distances herself from him, feeling like she’s been played.
* **Scene 9: A Tearful Goodbye** Iris retreats further into her shell, pulling away from her friends, including Nick, who tries to console her. Her world is shaken as she processes the betrayal, unsure whom to trust. She feels like she’s been made a fool, and the pain of being used for a bet eats at her. Her friends, especially Nick, continue to stand by her, but Iris is closed off, focusing on her schoolwork and trying to numb the hurt.

# Act 5: The Fallout

* **Scene 10: Marcus’s Regret** Marcus is deeply regretful for his actions. He realizes that he’s fallen in love with Iris for real, and the guilt of his betrayal weighs heavily on him. He tries to reach out to her, sending messages and apologizing, but Iris refuses to acknowledge him. Despite this, Marcus continues to reflect on how much he’s changed through his connection with her.
* **Scene 11: Nick and Quinn’s Breakup** Nick’s emotional turmoil takes a toll on his relationship with Quinn Grace. The tension between them reaches a breaking point after Nick confides in Quinn about Iris’s pain and how much Marcus has hurt her. Quinn, who had been supportive of the bet, doesn’t understand why Nick is so invested in Iris’s feelings, and the couple argues. Eventually, their misunderstandings lead to a painful breakup. Heartbroken, Nick turns to Iris for comfort, and the two lean on each other as they both process their individual heartbreaks.

# Act 6: The Healing Process

* **Scene 12: A Supportive Circle** Iris’s friends continue to support her, reminding her of her worth and encouraging her to focus on her art. Despite the pain, Iris starts to heal, finding solace in her creativity. Meanwhile, Marcus keeps trying to show her that he’s truly changed—no longer motivated by a bet. He attends one of her art exhibitions and buys one of her pieces, demonstrating that his feelings are real.
* **Scene 13: Nick’s Growth** Nick, still reeling from his breakup with Quinn, begins to grow emotionally. He talks to Iris about his pain, and together they help each other work through their feelings. Their bond grows stronger, and Nick begins to realize that he may still have unresolved feelings for Quinn. Meanwhile, Iris opens up to Nick about Marcus’s actions and her struggle to forgive him.

# Act 7: Marcus’s Continued Effort

* **Scene 14: A Heartfelt Gesture** After weeks of trying to prove his sincerity, Marcus makes a heartfelt gesture. He shows up at Iris’s favorite coffee shop, bringing her a handmade gift inspired by her art, and apologizes again. While Iris is still hesitant, she sees that Marcus has truly changed, and she appreciates the effort he’s made to show his genuine feelings.
* **Scene 15: Marcus’s Apology** Marcus writes Iris a letter in which he admits the bet was the worst decision of his life. He confesses that he’s fallen for her and promises that his feelings are no longer a game. Iris reads the letter, and while she’s still cautious, it’s clear that Marcus’s sincerity is winning her over.

# Act 8: The Turning Point

My cousin (mid-30s M) has been living with me for the past 7 years. It wasn't supposed to be this long of a stay.

My cousin has been really relying on me for the past year. I've had to call the ambulance for him when he was going through alcohol withdrawal. I woke up to him screaming in the middle of the night and he didn't even comprehend what he was doing, nor did he remember it. I had to drive 5 hours in the middle of the night for him to get help and then go to work without enough sleep. Those were the wordt moments and it really shook my view of him. He was relying solely on me and it was breaking me down.

I think things would have continued like that if he hadn't left for a little bit. I got a taste of how relaxed I felt with a space truly to myself. I didn't have to pass by the sink and see my dishes and pans sitting in filthy water. There was no footsteps at odd hours of the night from when he went to take a smoke.

It finally got to the point where I broke down on a call with our uncle and he's finally taking the steps to get his own place. I'm too unconfrontational so I had to get my uncle to do it. I think I was really afraid that he would break if I told him I wanted to go.

Will he take my things when he leaves? He didn't have anything when he came here. The dresser, bed, couch, coffee table... They're all mine. Will he try to take them?",1,1743391609.0,u_LibrarianNo619,0,1.0,False

Should I have unopposed upper rear teeth removed? 

I'm 57. I have severe malocclusion. I don't smoke. I drink 1-2 coffees a day and 3-4 alcoholic beverages a week.

My ""normal"" bite involves my front lower teeth in front of my upper front teeth. I had an awful orthodontist in the 80's. I also have some external resorption and will have a few implants soon. Not sure why but I don't like the idea of getting the teeth in a day....

Because of my weird bite, my rear upper teeth are unopposed when biting and are coming down more than the other teeth. They don't hit anything and there's no pain. I don't like having messed up teeth but I'm rolling with it and I don't really want to have major facial surgery.

My dentist thinks they should be removed because they are unopposed and to have better access for cleaning the adjacent teeth. Does this sound right? Or unnecessary? 

Any thoughts appreciated.

I know several other people, myself included, with links on their profile so I did not think much of it at first. My first thought was honestly, 'Good on them for getting published!'

But then the last chapter of every fic was an ad, paraphrased: 'hey. I have published works. Check them out. If you want to send me coffee money that'd be cool!' along with their cashapp and Venmo username. 

The ad got more detailed. The language changed. And now at the end of every chapter there is an ad (that is as long or longer than the work) and it is not even in the author's note. They put the ad in the actual body! 

They now have all their links posted multiple times in every story they have posted, plus the final chapters that are massive ads, plus their profile. They no longer ask for 'coffee money' they ask for 'tips'. Just asking for money straight out. And they post practically every day so they are always in the feed.

I have never reported another author before across any platform and I am struggling, even though I know they are in fact going against at least one T.O.S., just on a personal level.

1jnu0am,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1jnu0am/wife_allergic_to_balsamic/,Wife Allergic to Balsamic,"Ever since I met her, my wife has been allergic to balsamic vinegar. She gets a red rash, TMJ symptoms/pain in her jaw, which all wears off after a few hours usually.

We do what we can to avoid balsamic. We tell restaurants, don’t buy foods with balsamic, etc.

Lately I’m noticing the reaction happening more often…and with different foods.

Given that it started with balsamic, I’m thinking that she’s getting more sensitive.

Okay…so what is it that is in balsamic vinegar that’s it making her react this way?

I’m doing internet searches and poking around for information.  She had a doctor perform an allergy test that came back with zero results for allergies.  Wanted to look for anyone here who may have an idea.

She recently ate a SMALL portion of the following things tonight before feeling the symptoms:

* [Potato chips - Three cheese Texas toast kettle chips](https://www.publix.com/pd/publix-kettle-chips-three-cheese-texas-toast/RIO-PCI-601969)

* [Strawberry swirl cheesecake](https://www.publix.com/pd/juniors-cheesecake-new-york-strawberry-swirl-6-inch/RIO-PCI-602959)

The symptoms I mentioned above also happens at rare times with pizza (Dominoes, Pizza Hut), though we assume that there was cross contamination with some balsamic glaze that accidentally made its way onto our food.

When I create AI art, it's not for validation, fame or money. I won't win any glory or be recognized for my talent. Even if I use other tools like Blender, Photoshop, Pen and Pad that mere fact that I use AI means my art has zero value and was made with just a prompt to some people. I choose to use AI as a tool to enhance my skills and deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence. I'm also not doing any of this for profit. I usually make just enough to cover my Core membership and maybe buy a cheap gas station coffee one in a few months.

I think when someone chooses to create AI art, it’s no different from any other artist who wants to bring their ideas to life. AI is simply the tool they use to make it happen.

It's about the primal desire to create—not the pursuit of fame, glory, or profit.

I spent years trying to learn how to draw, purely out of a desire to express myself. I never aspired to become a professional artist or make money from it. I never took commissions or accepted projects because I knew money would corrupt my hobby, as it tends to do with many things. I simply had a vivid imagination and wanted a way to ""save"" the images in my head, bringing them to life through my drawings and, later, digital works.

What frustrates me about the whole AI vs. ""real art"" debate is the refusal to acknowledge that people have different definitions of what art is. Furthermore, people want different things from art. Some seek fame and fortune, while others just want to bring their ideas to life.",12,1743390959.0,DefendingAIArt,2,0.93,False

She’ll say she’s “so swamped” with other work (which, again, she doesn’t do) and end up doing the bare minimum while the rest of us pick up the slack. Then, when we call her out, she plays it off like it’s not a big deal or jokes about how she’s “so bad at this stuff.”  

She’s also just… annoying in small ways that add up. We all talk over each other sometimes, but Shila does it in a way that derails conversations. We’ll be discussing weekend plans, and she’ll cut in with a completely random story about how her roommate took her coffee mug. And she won’t stop. It’s like she doesn’t notice when people aren’t interested.  

We also joke around a lot, but Shila always takes it one step too far. If someone makes a self-deprecating joke, she’ll pile on instead of reading the room. One time, I was stressed about my grades and joked, “Guess I’m just gonna fail this class.” And she went, “I mean, you don’t really take notes, so…” It was weirdly blunt and stung more than it should have.  

Lately, we’ve been low-key avoiding her. Not outright excluding her, but we don’t invite her to last-minute study sessions because we know she’ll just ask for answers instead of contributing. She recently confronted us, saying she feels like she’s being left out. And now I feel guilty.  

AITA for disliking her when some of the things she does are things we all do—just in a way that makes us hate it?",7,1743390733.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,4,1.0,False

I have now lost 2 very close friends due to them continuously pushing me to sign up to be an Arbonne consultant. They would continuously push and push until I just had to stop being friends with them. They didn’t care about my friendship anymore. They just wanted me to buy Arbonne products from them or wanted me under them in the Arbonne lineup.

Now I have a third friend who recently got into Arbonne six months ago. It sucks because she’s a really good friend of mine and our sons are the same age so we’re also experiencing motherhood together.  But she has completely been brainwashed by Arbonne. She makes 5-30 Instagram stories a day about Arbonne. Every conversation is about Arbonne. She shames people for drinking coffee and suggest they should drink Arbonnne fizz sticks instead because coffee is yucky. She started shaming me because I drink alcohol once in a while and she told me I should be drinking Arbonne stress relief instead of a glass of wine. She also has claimed that drugstore products or basically any products that aren’t Arbonne are extremely toxic and led to infertility and so on. She acts like she is a medical professional and a dietician. 

I’m honestly exhausted and fed up and I have told her numerous times that I do not want to sign up. I honestly don’t know if I can hold onto this friendship either 😵‍💫",17,1743390677.0,antiMLM,8,0.95,False

The pattrn app has a dating app component to it.  I matched with a guy and we started chatting.  He quickly wanted to move to Signal and I agreed b/c the app's chat component sucked.  His profile tells me he's an engineer and he shares that he is a shipwright engineer.  After chatting for about 2 weeks, I very loudly hinted that I wouldn't turn him down for coffee or dinner.  We didn't meet. I was busy and he was busy.  By the 3rd week, he tells me he's going to Korea for a work trip.  He's been there since December.  We've chatted almost daily and at the same times.

He's sent me pics and one video.  I got one candid pic with a handwritten note. I've received one picture of his dog. All this made me think this might be a real person.

Now, here's where I feel dumb and need someone to tell me the truth.  About a month in, he's having issues with his bank and he's been flagged for whatever reason.  He asks me to log in from here in the states so that he can then log in later. It makes no sense to me, but I agree.  I'm able to get in. I see he does have money in this account.  But he's not able to access his funds from where he is.  He asks me to send him money, I initially said no. I then told him I could send him some money. this has been going on since December. I didn't think this work trip would last this long.

Now, here's where I'm also confused. He has people send me money, I then send it to him. These are all men names and supposedly it's for a bid he needs to make for a project.  I've received these funds via CashApp and PayPal.

I feel so stupid and confused. I always thought I was smart, but I'm second guessing myself. Has anyone experienced this?

I got the confidence to ask her to meet up. Here’s how it went:

Her: yeah I’d love to

Me: Ok no rush. Just lmk and we’ll find a day and time. 

Her: okay:)

I have so much free time that I am soooo bored but better bored then drinking. I had a few bumps but never have done what I did before

I just still can't believe how much free time I have and how free of constant guilt and secrecy I feel. I would spend my mornings feeling like shit secretly and then spent my mid morning and early afternoon figuring out time how I can get my alcohol. I needed to rotate stores to avoid judgement from employees and calculate my time to get there and back timing perfectly so my spouse didn't know I bought a few bottles of wine. I also needed time to hide it. I always drank at night  from 5-8ish (a bottle always) but they never knew about the extra 1-2 bottles I would drink without them knowing. 

When I could drink at night after my spouse would go upstairs to do her nightly shower/reading ritual, I was constantly on edge because I would need to secretly open my bottles and pour/drink without being caught. I constantly would need to listen if my wife came out of the bathroom and panic hide my glass. I would need to time when to start chewing gum or eat breath alternating substance so I didn't smell like alcohol. I needed to make excuses on why I was acting funny still after I ""stopped"" drinking hours earlier. Coffee/caffeine energy was my excuse. 

I am glad I managed this far. My spouse now knows what I had to go through behind her back. It's better to be bored than the misery of drinking. Thought I'd share for anyone struggling right now with boredom and thinking about going back. This kind of boredom is freedom.

1jntmso,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jntmso/ive_been_talking_to_someone_in_the_night_at_first/,"I've been talking to someone in the night. At first it was weird, but now I'm genuinely horrified.","Everything started 2 months ago. 

In January, I moved to a new house in Port Arthur. I had recently divorced from my husband after a 6 year marriage, and I wanted to live somewhere I could be free. I also brought with me my golden retriever, Milo. At that time he was almost 2 years old. 

When I first saw the house, I was instantly amazed, it was beautiful. The garden was big, filled with green grass (especially Milo was happy) and I immediately contacted the landlord and told him it was sold. 

The 1st night in my new house was perfect. When I lay on my bed, it felt like euphoria was bubbling inside my body, I felt so cozy, safe, and free in my covers, all at the same time. 

Those were the only nights I felt safe though. 

  
On the 4th night, I woke up to some strange growling sounds. It sounded like a baby kitten that was being beaten to death combined with some gurgling and thuds. I woke up and checked the clock, it was 3:55. Milo was next to me in bed and he was shivering and whimpering, which was strange because he had never acted like this before. There was no reason he should've acted this way. 

Oh boy, I was so wrong. 

Because that was when I started actually hearing the growling sounds. It felt like it was coming from the room next to me, yet I couldn't build up the courage to stand up and walk over there. I decided that the growling sounds could be the neighbor's, and calmed myself down to sleep again. At almost 5, the growling sounds finally stopped.  

This continued for almost a month, when one night, something scary happened. 

I woke up to thudding sounds, and this time there was no growling. I looked beside me for Milo, but he wasn't there. In fact, the spot next to me was completely empty but warm, which meant that Milo was here but had just left. 

""Milo!"" I yelled repeatedly. I finally got out of bed and stood up. I slowly walked down the corridor and it was completely pitch black. On my 4th step, I saw a pair of yellow eyes in the dark. It felt like it was the only source of light and it illuminated the dark room. I was so scared that I couldn't even scream. I had no idea what I was supposed to do at the moment. 

""Milo...is that you?"" I reached out slowly and hoped that I would touch that furry, cute little dog that he was. 

Then, another pair of yellow eyes appeared in the dark. This time, I actually screamed. I ran to my room, gasping for air and lo and behold, Milo was sitting at the door of my room, but his hair was all soaking wet, and he was again shivering vigorously. 

I slammed the door behind me, my worries of the yellow eyes started to fade. All I worried about right now was Milo and what happened to him.

""Milo!"" I exclaimed, scared. I found out his whole body was covered in blood. It was like someone had grabbed him and dunked him in a pot of blood, let him stand in the cold rain while some of it washed off, then told him to come back to me. Milo was still whining and whimpering (possibly from the cold), so I decided to wash him up. 

When I was washing him, I could feel someone, no, something's presence looming over me. When I was bathing him, I felt someone watching. When I was combing his fur, I felt someone watching. When I dried him, I felt someone watching. 

Finally when I was done with Milo, it was dawn. I hadn't gotten a good night's sleep, so I went straight to bed again. 

When I woke up, it was in the middle of the night again. Somehow, I had slept from dawn to the next night. Was this possible? I wasn't a very deep sleeper. 

And then it hit me. 

What if, I hadn't slept for so long, in fact Milo's incident was just a dream? I had always had crazy dreams, but this dream felt too realistic to believe. I looked to the spot beside me on my bed, and there Milo was, all cozied up and sleeping.

I couldn't understand anything that was happening to me. I felt scared and unsafe. At this point, I just fell asleep again.

This time, I woke up during the afternoon. I went out of bed to make a coffee for myself, and Milo came along with me. Everything seemed great, only the nightime was when weird things happens. I was scrolling on Instagram when I found this app that allows you to track your sleep and record anything that you say or do in the middle of the night.

That night, I set the app up after having dinner. I ate a fulfilling meal of Mcdonalds and went straight to bed after. I placed my phone in the bedside table and went to sleep.

That night, I slept soundly, my first time in a month. When I woke up, it was morning and I was feeling as happy as a goose. 

I checked my sleep tracker. I had slept for 8 hours straight, and it said,"" WELL DONE"" on the app. I played the recordings that was recorded during the night. What it recorded shocked me. 

In the middle of the night, I could hear sounds of muffled rustling, like someone was looking through my drawers. That was shocking, but not the scariest part. The scariest part was, I heard my own voice asking,"" What are you doing?"" and a deep male voice that said,"" Nothing.""

After that short conversation, the rustling disappeared, and everything was silent. 

How was this possible? I lived in the house by myself, and I was sure of it. I could recognize my own voice although I do not recall saying anything in the middle of the night. And, who was that deep male voice? Could my ex have sneaked in? He did not know any details related to my address, so I was unsure of that. 

The following night, weird conversations was recorded again. I heard rustling again (from the recordings), then my voice saying,"" Go away please."" and a deep male voice again, saying,"" Why?"" After that, it was silent again.

Today, I have moved away from the house because of my frightening encounters with these weird experiences. I no longer have sleeping problems, and I don't see or hear voices in the dark anymore. 

Although I am probably safe now, I still am very curious. 

Who or what was haunting me in the other house? Why? I will never forget my experience in the other house, and one day, I will find you, the person who haunted me.",11,1743389941.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1jntmqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wish_apon_a_scam/comments/1jntmqt/whose_fault/,Whose fault?👂,"Dear 💩, your kids were not removed because of a warrant, hotel, TF, CC, KS, because your tiktok famous or too many calls to cps. Your kids were removed because of abuse and neglect from you and your boyfriend. Stop lying. 
You and only you decided to go live and post videos of your life. These lives and videos revealed so much horrendous things. It was so bad 6500+ people were in a reddit sub and collectively decided that your kids needed saving from what was happening to them. This is not the first time and you know this. Your oldest was permanently removed and placed with his dad 7 years ago. Three were removed and you got them back eventually. Now, this time all 5 are gone. There's no way you can post the stuff you did and think 6500 people would think it's ok. Let's delve into some lives and videos. *Food and meals.* Let's start there. We saw your kids beg for food and be denied. We saw them sneak food. We saw them falling asleep at the table at 11 pm waiting for their portioned out slop. We heard you say many times how they only eat 2x's a day. Breakfast ( usually around 1 pm) was the night before left overs. Then MAYBE a snack. Then dinner at 11 pm again. All your kids were underweight and had dark circles and a sallow look. You got loaded teas, ice coffee, biscuit sandwiches, you hid tons of snacks in your room. YOU never went without. You took good care of you. We heard your boyfriend threaten your son with bodily harm because he was hiding food in his room. You would fuss and cry for hours about how you had no food for the kids. You wouldn't stop the dry begging until one or more followers felt so bad they would have domino's deliver lots of pizzas. You sent them to the old man neighbor to ask him for food.  Your kids were constantly HUNGRY.
*Your kids health.* your kids were years behind for wellness checks and childhood vaccinations. All the kids were malnourished and underweight. All the kids had rotted teeth and/or severe dental problems. We saw your daughter crying on camera for 3 days straight about dental pain. It was pitiful. People called cps. Cps made you get her to a dentist. Your baby was left unattended and had an accident where his top teeth jammed way up into his gums. He wasn't seen in your lives for days. You hid him. He got so bad he stopped eating, drinking and became limp and listless. Only then did you take him for emergency care and surgery. Your kids were always full of bruises all over their bodies. The baby needed to ER visits for severe diaper rash. He was never changed. Soggy droopy diaper was the norm.your kids were medically neglected. *hygiene* your kids were filthy. Their clothes were ripped, stained, dirty, didn't fit. Same clothes worn for days. And slept in. Your boy went to church filthy, covered in feces and stinking like poop. The church officials called CPS. Both you and kevin said he was the only one that bathed/showered the kids. You couldn't be bothered. *your house* the house was filthy and disgusting. The furniture was chewed up by the dog and was so stained it looked shiny. You showed us holes Kevin punched/kicked in the walls and doors. Trash piled up in the rooms. Sheets for curtains. Food all over the floors, beds, furniture. Spa tub destroyed, door frames knocked out. No sheets on the beds. The 5 y.o. slept on a filthy crib mattress that you let the dog delivery her puppy on it.  You cleaned only when CPS had a scheduled visit. The yard was trashed too. You showed the baby sitting in dirt surrounded by cat and dog poop. All the smoke detectors were taken down. Vents stuffed with trash. Filthy mop bucket left for weeks. *animals* after you were evicted a dead cat was found in a box outside. Probably the "" missing"" cat Kevin hated. The dog and her pup were so skinny you could see nothing but rib bones. Left outside with no water during a heat wave. Left outside 24/7 in the winter. Full of fleas and tics. Kittens your son shoved down a heating vent. Same son seen kicking and punching a cat in the head. Kevin hitting a new born pup with a hair brush. *safety* the baby crawling around an loaded rifle type bb gun. The baby sitting on counter next to huge boiling pot of soup. Baby on counter with big sharp carving knife. 4 y.o. getting your loaded pistol out of truck console and waving it around in the truck with siblings there. You left them all unattended while you did an errand. Your loaded gun left in your bedside table. Same loaded gun left on bookshelf. Cps finally caught wind of this and made you put a lock on it. You were cited multiple times for kids not being secured properly in the truck. You outside smoking a blunt trying to shoot a target. Making targets with family members faces for the kids to shoot at. Having young son use garden tiller barefoot. * wierd, inappropriate stuff* the lollipop/hard on video. The video of Kevin blow drying the naked baby after his bath. Kevin saying he is the only one who bathes/showers ALL your kids alone because that's his "" bonding time"". Telling your daughter she will be r a p e d and made to call a stranger daddy for 8 years if cps takes them. Your son staring at your daughter while he openly rubs himself as you laugh at it. Showing your son your bloody mess and pads while your live on the toilet. He was traumatized and regressed back into diapers. Taking multiple pregnancy tests during your lives. Having your children record you while you tweak, grind, any vile. Kevin constantly seen nodding out. Drug paraphernalia seen in a lot of videos. Drug pipe, still warm found by your son. You admitting Kevin physically abused you in front of the kids. You admitting Kevin uses corporal punishment to discipline. The way Kevin hugs, kisses, caresses the baby. How you tried to convince Kevin he was the baby's bio dad. *Education* your took your kids out of school because you couldn't get up in the morning and get them ready. They missed so much. The school called cps. Then when you threw something at your daughters face and she went to school with marks, they called again. So you pulled them out. By the time they were removed they were 2-3 years behind other kids. One had a big speech impediment. They couldn't read, write or do basic math. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There is TONS more to unravel.
We didn't even get into all the frauds, scams, dry begging, go fund me's, theft by deception. 
So, tell us again how your kids being removed is because you had a warrant. And none of it is your fault. Cmon girl...tell us.

1jntk0n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jntk0n,Any small scale composters who sell?,"I lost my job in the chemical plant as an operator of 10 years back in August of 2024. Been applying like crazy, have had several interviews, doesn’t seem to be working out. I cannot stay out of work too much longer or I’m going to run into some problems, obviously. So my current dream is to start a local composting business. There is none in my area for at least 75 miles out. The potential is definitely there and I know the market demand is also because all of the local nurseries buy compost from out of state to sell in the stores. I already collect from local smoothie shops and coffee shops, but that’s barely putting a dent in it. I also have connections with the local tree companies to dump wood chips on my property. I have a couple acres to work with. I already have 5 pallet bins going since October and that’s with me cutting back on picking up from these different shops. But what I don’t understand is how all the YouTube channels I see say that they turn waste into a highly profitable business when a whole yard sells for $30-$50 and a 40lb sack sells for $5-$10. It takes much more than a yard of raw materials to make a yard of compost. Any tips or suggestions? Guidelines I should follow? I have a lot of ideas but I’m honestly afraid to commit.

When I reached over to the nightstand, I accidentally knocked over my alarm clock. It crashed to the ground, shattering into jagged shards of plastic and glass. Not a good way to start the day.

I answered the phone. “Look, whoever this is, you owe me a new alarm clock.”

“Get over here.” I recognized Troy’s voice immediately. “We have a problem.”

“A please would be appreciated.”

“Stow the snark, James,” he said. “This is serious.”

I looked around my empty bedroom. There were piles of clothes strewn about the floor, along with old gin bottles and spent cigarette butts. Last night was a haze of loud music and endless drinking. I couldn’t be sure, but my breath said I’d ordered a pizza too.

Looking down at the bits of plastic and glass, I said, “Fine, but while I got ya on the line, let me tell you a little about this new alarm clock you’re gonna buy me.”

While I got dressed, I went on and on about the clock. I wanted one that could connect to the internet, play music, and use Bluetooth. Troy was quiet as I rambled, and when I was finished, he said: “I’m at a brownstone on thirty-second. Apartment twenty-five. Move your ass, we’re burning daylight.”

Outside the bedroom window, the sky was dark and amassed with clouds. There wasn’t daylight yet to burn.

The call disconnected, and I pocketed my cell phone. I swiped my jacket from the floor. There was a slight bulge in the breast pocket. My cigarettes were still there. Then, I grabbed my keys, wallet, and handgun from the dresser. On the way out, I stopped in the bathroom to brush my teeth, but even after relentlessly scrubbing with cheap cinnamon-flavored toothpaste, my breath still smelled like greasy pizza and gin.

Some things never come out no matter what you do.

Driving to the south side of town, I found the brownstone Troy had told me about and stepped inside. The inner walls were white and barren save a few odd holes and yellow cigarette stains. The carpet was fuzzy and mottled by discolored blotches. I’m not one to judge, my place wasn’t much better. The rent was a little more expensive because I lived on the east side, but otherwise, they were pretty much the same.

In the city, in life, you’ve got to do whatever it takes to get by. Even if it means living in rat-infested apartments where neighbors blared screamo music and there was asbestos in the walls.

Climbing two flights of stairs, I knocked twice on the door to apartment twenty-five. Footsteps thundered from inside, followed by the rattle of a chain-lock being disarmed. The door opened, and Troy peered out at me through a crack in the door.

“This better be good,” I said, rubbing the exhaustion from my eyes. “I was having a great dream—”

“Yeah, yeah. You can tell me about it later,” he said, throwing the door open and pulling me inside. He slammed the door shut behind us, locking it again. “Word of warning, situation’s a little tricky.”

In our line of work, when wasn’t it “tricky”?

Troy had your typical bouncer look. Broad-shouldered, short blond hair, lantern jaw, built like a linebacker. He wore dark denim pants and a grimy leather jacket with more years on it than most cars.

He was the kind of guy Mr. Rousseau liked to keep for the first half of the day because he was well-read and personable. Intimidating at first glance, but in private company, he was quiet and reserved. These were the hours Mr. Rousseau handled the legitimate side of the business.

Plus, mornings and early afternoons were the only hours that worked for Troy’s schedule since he had a wife and two kids.

“Wait a minute.” Troy leaned in close and sniffed. “Are you drunk?”

“Not entirely.”

“What the fuck, James! It’s a Thursday.”

“Yeah, and Mr. Rousseau usually has me on at night. So, why the hell am I being called in at three in the morning?”

He gestured for me to follow as he started down the narrow hallway. I didn’t recognize the apartment. Mr. Rousseau lived on the north side of town, and Troy had a house on the west side. The south side of the city was reserved for addicts, deadbeats, and broke college kids. There weren’t many in Rousseau’s personal circle that fit the bill.

We turned at the corner and followed the rest of the hallway to a closed door. Troy hesitated with his hand on the knob, looking over his shoulder at me. There were shadows in his eyes. Despair. He sighed and turned the knob, pushing the door open. Instantly, before I even entered the bedroom, I could taste the metal and copper in the air. Smell the early stages of decay.

If something like that doesn’t wake you up, nothing will.

The bedroom was a dingy space with splintered floorboards and a sagged ceiling. Next bad rainstorm would probably knock out a few tiles. The furniture was ancient and dilapidated. In the far corner, an old boxy TV displayed a screen of black-and-white fuzz, hissing quietly in the background as we examined the scene.

“What the fuck happened?” I asked.

Any semblance of drunkenness had abandoned me, replaced by a stone-cold sobriety that made me want to scream or punch something.

“There was an incident,” Troy said haphazardly. Always the professional. “It’s a bit complicated.”

That was one way of putting it.

On the queen-sized bed was a partially naked girl lying limp on the mattress. Sheets and blankets swirled around her, splattered in blood. Her limbs were splayed at odd angles, lifeless. The back of her head was caved open with a jagged rim of exposed skull peering out through her long black hair. I kneeled to inspect the wound, thinking Troy had maybe brought me in for amateur medical attention. I’d spent the first eighteen years of my life working on a farm, caring and tending to animals. Whenever I wasn’t slaughtering them.

Adjusting the head of a nearby lamp on the nightstand, a bright yellow light shined against the top of the girl’s head. Her injury was untreatable in given circumstances. Blunt-force trauma with noticeable swelling and severe hemorrhaging. The skin was ruddy red with a slight undertone of blue. There were tiny bits of bone, hair, and flesh amongst the exposed grey matter of her brain.

I almost suggested a hospital in the area, but reality dawned on me. I would’ve been better off suggesting a morgue.

Then, as I was examining the wound, the girl’s brain began to shift beneath the undulating pool of blood. For a moment, I thought she might open her eyes and sit up in bed. This expectation died in its cradle as I watched a fly crawl out from the mixture of blood and membrane. Its wings fluttered a few times, and once they were clean, it took off into the air.

I quickly turned away, gagging against last night’s dinner. Shouldn’t have had so much pizza or gin, but I’m a creature of habit.

“Seriously,” I stammered, leaning against the wall, staring down at my shoes, desperately trying not to think about the dead girl, “what the fuck happened?”

“I already told you: there was an incident.”

“Yeah, no shit there was an incident.”

“It was an accident, James.”

You don’t get an injury like that from an accident unless it involves a head-on collision or a flight of stairs.

“Oh, an accident? That makes it so much better.” I glimpsed at the girl again, my heart swelling with a mixture of disgust and pity. “Is she dead?”

I don’t know why I asked. She had the pale complexion of a corpse. The putrid stink of a corpse. Probably had the sour taste of one too.

Troy shrugged. “My gut tells me she’s most likely dead.”

“Most likely?”

“No, yeah, she’s dead.” He considered this for a moment before nodding. “Definitely dead. Mr. Rousseau clubbed her over the head with an ashtray.”

I exhaled carefully. “That oughta do it.” I reached inside my jacket pocket and removed a pack of Viceroy cigarettes, lighting one the instant it met my lips. “Why’d he do it?”

“Lost his cool for a second.”

“Really? Only for a second.”

Troy threw his hands up defensively. “Look, I was just chillin’ in the living room, reading a book, when I heard her scream. By the time I got in here, well, it was finished.”

 “Did he say anything?”

“He wants us to clean it up.”

“No shit, Sherlock. I mean, did he say anything about why he did it?”

Troy scoffed. “He actually wrote a ten-page essay about it if you’re interested in reading it.”

I considered punching him, but the only reason Troy and I had lasted as partners was because we knew not to take it out on each other. We had an unspoken policy: ‘Just do the job and get out. No questions asked.’ In situations like that, though, it was hard to refrain from asking any questions.

“Well,” I said, slowly regaining my equilibrium with the help of nicotine calming my nerves, “where the hell is Rousseau?”

“Don’t worry about it. I called some guys to take him back to his penthouse. But we’ve gotta fix this fast. The girl has a roommate. She’s outta town right now, but she’ll be back around noon.”

“We’re so fucked.”

“Not if we move fast,” Troy promised. “I’ve already got it figured out. I’ll stay here and clean up the mess. I just need you to take care of the body.”

“Fuck you. I’m not driving a dead body through the city at three in the morning. I’ll stay and clean up the scene. You can deliver the girl.”

“I can’t.”

“Why not?”

“I don’t have a license.”

“Hasn’t stopped you before.”

“My tags are expired too.”

That’s when it hit me. “Oh, fucking forget about it! We’re not putting a dead girl in the trunk of my car.”

“Why not?”

“Because it’s my personal vehicle, dumbass.”

“It’s a minivan, not a Maserati.”

“It’s still my car. I’m not letting you fuck it up.”

“It’s what soccer moms use to drive their kids to school. A little blood isn’t going to ruin it.”

I started pacing back and forth across the room. Floorboards creaked beneath my feet. The nicotine was making me sick, and my sleep deprivation wasn’t helping either.

Troy groaned, exasperated. “Will you please just be cool about this? We don’t have time to bicker like an old married couple. We need to get this fixed. Now!”

“Son of a bitch!” I kicked the wall. Dried paint chips fell to the floor. “Okay, alright, fine! What’s the play?”

“I’ve got some plastic wrap and a few blankets. We’ll bundle her up, carry her downstairs, and load her into the trunk. Then, you’ll take her to one of the usual spots.”

By ‘usual spots’ he meant one of the local businesses we used to dispose of bodies. There were a few throughout the city, but my go-to was Mason and Sons, a funeral home on the north side of town. Mason was a pleasant man, despite his affiliation with someone like Mr. Rousseau. And his means of disposal was perhaps the most humane I could think of. Better than the scrapyard or the butcher shop.

We exited the apartment, went downstairs, and stepped out into the parking lot. Troy’s car was near the back corner, far away from the rest. He opened the truck and removed the top panel. Beneath, where there should’ve been a spare tire, was instead a cache of random supplies for situations like this. Handcuffs, duct tape, zip ties, trash bags, bleach, soap, ammonia, disinfectant wipes, paper towels, and whatever else.

I almost made a joke about how maybe he should be driving the minivan, but I couldn’t get the thoughts from my mind to my tongue without wanting to puke. So, I just silently smoked my cigarette instead.

Back in the apartment, we gathered everything covered in blood into one of the trash bags. We also threw in some of the girl’s personal belongings like her wallet, keys, and cell phone. Troy took whatever excess cash from her purse, asking me if I wanted to split it.

“You fuckin’ scumbag,” I muttered.

“Oh, forgive me, Prince Charming,” he said. “Some of us got bills to pay.”

“More like alimony.”

Troy cuffed me on the shoulder for that one. In this line of work, it was hard to have a family. Especially on nights when you had to gaze into the emaciated face of a young dead girl, trying not to think of your daughter or wife.

You have to lie to yourself. Detach yourself from the situation. Pretend that you can still be the good guy, but ultimately, guilt always resurfaces. Usually late at night, while you’re in bed, listening to the silence of the world around you, staring up at the shadows on the ceiling like ink blots on a Rorschach test.

I see a happy little dog, you might say. I see a pretty pink pony. I see the shattered skull of a young woman. I see the maggots wriggling around inside her brain. I see myself protecting the man who killed her because I’m just a dog on a leash.

Guys like us develop hobbies to distract ourselves from the silence, from the memories. Troy was a frequent reader of everything and anything. I’d seen him consume more books than a librarian. Once, I even caught him reading the dictionary because he didn’t have any other novels on hand.

For me, I liked to drink and smoke. It helped me sleep. Helped me clear my mind. When I wasn’t drinking, I was working.

My occupation was a complicated matter. If that weren’t already apparent. I usually followed Mr. Rousseau around like a good lil’ pup, going all across the city to visit underground clubs, bars, and other late-night establishments with morally questionable exchanges.

If I wasn’t acting as Mr. Rousseau’s bodyguard or personal assistant, I was off collecting debts and payments. That, or I was delivering packages. Most of the time, I had no clue what these packages contained, but I had my assumptions: narcotics, money, evidence, and so on.

Once, I had to deliver a sphere-shaped package wrapped in duct tape and plastic. I kept telling myself it was a basketball or soccer ball, but my gut told me otherwise. That was the first time I’d met the Butcher. When I handed him the package, he licked his lips and said: “This will do just fine.”

I avoided the butcher when at all possible.

By the time Troy and I finished collecting personal belongings, we had two bags full. I delivered those to the trunk of my car, and when I returned, Troy already had the girl enveloped in cellophane. We were somewhat skilled in the trade of making a person disappear.

We wrapped the girl in a few blankets and quilts. One of them was pink and had the word “Barbie” scrawled across it in swooping letters.

“So,” I said, “your daughter fell out of her doll phase then?”

“That’s what happens when you get them a cell phone.”

The last time we did this, we used blankets designed with monster trucks and Spongebob. His son had just turned eleven and got an Xbox with games like Call of Duty and Halo.

Once the blankets were in place, we secured them with duct tape. Then, after checking the apartment hallways, we carried the body to the parking lot. The sun was just starting to peer over the horizon, but morning traffic still hadn’t hit yet.

With the body inside, Troy shut the trunk and sighed. “You gonna take her to the Butcher?”

“No,” I said, a little too quickly to be impartial on the matter. “Mason’s place.”

“Butcher is closer.”

“She’s going to Mason. End of story.”

He shrugged and checked his watch. “Better get moving before he gets busy then.”

“No, shit,” I said, climbing into the car and starting the engine. “Have fun, Mr. Clean.”

Grumbling, he waved me away and headed back towards the building.

“I’m serious about that alarm clock,” I called out after him. “It better be expensive and brand-new.”

Troy flipped me off over his shoulder and disappeared inside. I shifted into drive and started across the city, careful to obey the speed limit and stop at all traffic lights. The last thing I needed was to catch any unwanted attention.

While I was driving, my hands began to shake. The road oscillated in front of me, fusing with the night sky. Stars blurred and coalesced into a single bright light of fluorescent white. I rubbed my eyes and searched the glove box, returning with a hand-sized bottle of gin. It steadied my nerves, placating the adrenaline coursing through my veins.

A man without his medicine goes a little mad from time to time.

At Mason and Sons Funeral Home, I parked in the back. I tried calling him, but it went straight to voicemail. So, I climbed the back steps to the rear entrance and knocked. It took a few minutes, but eventually, his wife appeared. Her smile vanished, and she looked at me with discernible disgust.

“It’s four-thirty in the morning,” she growled.

“Nice to see you too, Shelia,” I replied, affecting a delicate tone. She, like many others, preferred Troy over me, but she could’ve probably gone the rest of her life without ever speaking to either one of us again. “Mason here?”

She stepped aside, waving me inside. “He’s in the back office. Be quick about it. We’ve got a family coming in at five.”

“You could try to be a little nicer. Mr. Rousseau pays to keep the fuckin’ lights on in this place, y’know.”

Her scowl deepened, forming lines across her forehead, accentuating the hollow crevices around her sunken eyes. She reeled back and slapped me across the face. “Make it snappy, you rat fuck, and get the hell outta here.”

“Fair enough.”

I rubbed the sting from my cheek and moved down the hallway. That’s where I bumped into two of Mason’s sons. I didn’t remember their names, and they probably didn’t remember mine either. But we were familiar with each other.

A while back, Mr. Rousseau made me retrieve the older one from a crack den on the south side while the kid was on a bender. I had to fend off two different dealers and a Chihuahua that wouldn’t stop nipping at my heels.

Because of the younger son, I had to visit a few families on the north side with a large cash settlement to keep them silent about something involving their teenage daughters. I don’t know all the details, but the little bastard wasn’t allowed to interact with any of the grieving customers who came in. Probably for the best, all things considered.

The sons nodded at me and left. I continued down the hall into the back office. Inside, Mason sat behind his desk with a cup of coffee in one hand and a manilla file in the other. He flipped through pages, squinting through a pair of tiny spectacles that were comically small. I had to wonder if he could even see through them.

Despite his kids, Mason was a decent person. As far as humans are concerned. He reminded me of my grandfather. An old oak tree slowly wilting while the rest of the forest was chopped down to make room for new shops and apartments. Just a man trying to stay afloat, willing to do whatever it took to keep his family safe and secure.

Mason glanced up at me and smiled. “James, I wasn’t expecting you.”

“Sorry, Mason,” I said. “I tried to call, but there was no answer.”

“Phone’s in the other room.” He set his coffee down and closed the folder. Leaning forward on his desk, he clasped his hands together and asked, “What can I do for you, my boy?”

He was from a different generation where people said things like “my boy” or “simmer down” or on occasion, such as when I brought his son home from the drug den, “damn shame” while shaking his head.

I sat in the chair across from him and explained the situation, what little I knew. When I was finished, Mason took off his spectacles, pinched the bridge of his nose, and exhaled. He tried to smooth back the wispy grey hair on his head, but there were so few left that they refused to obey.

“The situation’s a bit muddled,” I told him, affecting Troy’s professionalism. “We’re tryin’ to get it cleaned up as soon as possible. So, if you have anything, I would appreciate it. And I’m sure Mr. Rousseau would appreciate it too.”

Whenever dealing with these people, you have to throw out Mr. Rousseau’s name as much as possible. It’s the only way to get them to treat you seriously. The only way to keep their attention. Otherwise, you’re just a rat fuck. A dog without an owner.

“Let me see,” Mason said, flipping through a large black ledger. With every page, he licked his pruney fingers and hummed. “Hmm. Damn shame…damn shame. Young girl, was it?”

“Yes, sir. Not as young as you might think, but younger than either of us. Late teens, early twenties maybe. I’m guessing a college student. Maybe a part-time escort.”

Rousseau met most of his paramours late at night while wandering the city’s underbelly. Dancers at the clubs and waitresses at the bars. A repetitive routine that usually worked in his favour.

“And how’d it happen?” Mason asked.

I hesitated. My tongue wouldn't form the words. “Uh, probably for the best that you don’t know, sir.”

He chuckled. It was easy to approach these situations with a bit of humor when you weren’t looking at the corpse. Even someone like Mason, who’d been embalming and burying bodies since before I could drive, would probably feel faint at the sight of that girl. He’d clutch his metaphorical pearls and blink back tears. Maybe spend the afternoon in his office, drinking from the bottle of bourbon he kept in the bottom drawer.

“How soon would you need a hole?” Mason asked without looking up from his agenda.

“Today, if possible.”

The way Mason and Sons worked was we would deliver a body a few hours before a funeral. They would dig the grave about four or five feet deeper than usual, and we would drop the dead body inside. Then, we’d cover them up with a few inches of dirt, just enough to conceal the corpse. Once the funeral was done, they would transport the coffin and drop it down on top of the other corpse before sealing up the grave.

When the body was taken care of, they burned all evidence and possessions in their industrial furnace. At least, that’s what they told me, but the last time I visited, his younger son was sporting a new wristwatch that seemed vaguely familiar.

“I’m sorry to tell ya,” Mason said, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms across his chest, “but we just don’t have any open graves right now. If you can hold onto the body for a few more days, we might have availability this weekend.”

“We’ve got nowhere to store it until then.”

He cocked an eyebrow. “Where is she now?”

“My trunk.”

Mason blanched and reached for his coffee, his hand trembling as he lifted the mug to his lips. “Sweet Baby Jesus! You’ve got her with you as we speak? That’s what you’re tellin’ me?”

“Yes, sir. Unfortunately. Like I said, it’s a bit of a SNAFU.”

“No kiddin’, my boy.” He rubbed the few strands of hair on his chin. “I’m sorry. I wish I could help, but my hands are tied.”

I feigned nonchalance, but in reality, my heart was pounding against my chest. Sweat beaded on the back of my neck. I kept thinking about that dead girl, the hole in her skull, the stew of bone shards and hair inside her head. I needed to get rid of her, to get her out of my trunk so I could go back home, drink myself stupid, and fall asleep. Forget the day, let another replace it.

“You alright?” Mason asked me. “Can I get you a coffee or a cup of tea?”

“No, but thank you, sir.” I had gin waiting for me back in the car. “I should probably get going.”

“You know, I’m surprised to see you again. Thought you would’ve taken your leave by now. That was the plan, wasn’t it?”

“Yes, sir, but things changed. Thought I’d have my debts paid by now, but the bills never stop coming.”

He laughed. “You can say that again.”

Last winter, my father took a spill down the stairs and hit his head. While my mother was doing her best to sell the farm, there were no buyers. It was taking every last penny to keep her afloat while she waited for the life insurance policy to kick in. Bureaucrats always found a way to slow down the process.

I stood from my chair, shook Mason’s hand, and left. His wife followed me out the door, giving me one last glare before slamming the door shut.

When I got back in the car, I was overcome by the putrid stink of decay. I could practically taste the withering flesh, taste the metallic tinge of her blood in my mouth despite the layers of plastic and blankets. There must’ve been a hole or something. A part that wasn’t covered.

I rolled down the window and turned on the AC. Then, I retrieved my phone from my pocket and dialed Troy’s number.

Three rings before he answered. “Everything taken care of?”

“Not quite.”

“Great, what now?”

“Mason doesn’t have any open graves at the moment.”

“Guess you’ll have to go to the Butcher,” Troy said.

My blood turned cold, and I squeezed the steering wheel, digging my nails into the pleather. “No way! I’m not going to the Butcher.”

“Quit being such a baby and just do it.”

“The guy is a fuckin’ freakshow! I’m not going there alone.”

“Well, I’m a little preoccupied at the moment.” Troy took a deep breath and sighed. “You could try Davis’s Scrapyard. I don’t have his number, so you’ll have to drive over. He should be in by now.”

I wanted to smash my phone against the dashboard. Mr. Rousseau paid well, but in some situations, it wasn’t enough. Rock and a hard place, I guess.

“Whatever,” I said, exasperated. “Just hurry up with the apartment.”

“It’d go a lot faster if you didn’t call.”

I hung up and tossed the phone into the passenger seat. My foot pressed against the accelerator, turning the faint glow of street lights into a hazy smear of orange and yellow. Rain pattered across the windshield, and the rubber wipers squeaked against the glass. My hands fidgeted about the wheel, trembling whenever they didn’t have something stable to grasp onto. I reached into my pocket for another cigarette.

By the time I arrived at the scrapyard, I was stifling a gag between clenched teeth. The car reeked of burning tobacco and death. You could soak the inside with bleach, but the smell still wouldn’t go away.

Parking at the front gate, I found Davis in the main trailer, drinking a beer and throwing files into a trash can. He glanced over his shoulder at me, brow already furrowed, eyes bloodshot with fatigue.

“Nah,” he said. No hesitation, no fear. “Sorry, James, but I can’t.”

“You don’t even know why I’m here.”


“Don’t need to, buddy. If you’re here, it’s prob’ly something bad.” He emptied an entire drawer of files into the trash can before tossing it aside. “Trust me, this is the last place you wanna be.”

“And why’s that?”

“Last week, cops busted one of my garages. They’ve been watching my every move ever since. Whatever you’re here for, I doubt you want to get me involved.”

Davis operated several chop shops across the city. On the surface, they were any other garage, but in the back, they were stripping stolen cars for spare parts. Not exactly the worst of Mr. Rousseau’s colleagues, but his operation was big and turned quite a profit. An influential man to have in your pocket.

His scrapyard was convenient when it came to dead bodies. They had the kind of machinery that could crush a vehicle into a tiny cube. Imagine what it did to a corpse. Plus, there was plenty of land to bury bodies, and plenty of rubbish to hide the stink of rotting humans.

“It’s just one girl,” I said. “Slip of a thing. Wouldn’t be hard for you to dispose of. Wouldn’t take any time.”

He scoffed. “Maybe I’m not speaking clearly, but the cops are investigating me. They’re looking into every single thing I do. Dead girl is just what they need to get a warrant. Shit, screw the warrant, that would be enough for probable cause. We’d both be in cuffs, buddy. Is that what you want?”

Sometimes, prison seemed an easier sentence than working for Mr. Rousseau. But at the same time, it wouldn’t change much. I’d still be a mutt on a leash, I’d just have a different owner. Story of my life.

Davis and I went back and forth, arguing about the logistics of the situation, but in the end, I retreated to my car and started the engine again. I almost called Troy, but I already knew what he’d tell me. It’d been with me since I first left the brownstone. I had to go see the Butcher on Barker Street.",1,1743389339.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,1.0,False

We will do other things or I will do something else for him on an every other day basis. Sorry a little TMI…We just don’t have actual sex that much, but sometimes we do. His needs are taken care of ( if you catch my drift) at least 3 to 4 times a week. He will tell me they aren’t which I Do not understand but he told me just the other day that if he had any “extra” money he would get his needs taken care of and he wouldn’t have to be a “little bitch” about it, that then I wouldn’t be the problem. He says I should appreciate him more because I stay at home with the kids. He says he thinks about all the shit I’m not doing while he’s working. We have 3 very active children ranging from 6-13. I was working part time and he told me to stop working. I was working around his schedule because I enjoyed my job but he said if I didn’t stop working I don’t care about our children and our business. So of course I stopped working. I do all the paperwork for the business but it’s not very much maybe work about 2hrs a day for the company. He is a really good cook and normally cooks dinner. I would cook but when I do I can’t cook the same type of food for dinner he has for lunch or he won’t like what I make. I sometimes just make stuff and he will get mad or say it wasn’t that good, i actually am a good cook but when he’s there while I’m cooking he’s telling me what I’m doing wrong I get nervous then he just takes over so it’s not a fight. I love to bake and normally bake. I take all the kids to and from all their sports but make sure to come home eat dinner together, rub his back lay down with him when he goes to bed early but make sure to have the little one ready and tucked in for bed. We have been together for 19years. I feel like I keep up my appearance and figure and get ready every day. I don’t ask for anything beside my daily coffee but I am so easy going. I am a ride or die kind of girl and would do anything for him. I don’t think he has cheated but he accuses me of having an affair because it may be like 4 or 5 days of not having sex. I have so much on my mind and my body doesn’t work like that. I have to initiate it because he says he’s not doing that anymore. I don’t know, I guess I’m just ranting because I feel like I’m a really good wife. I’m not these women on you tube who does some super kinky stuff or has the house spotless with dinner done or breakfast made for him. My house is clean and I try to keep up on all the laundry. When he is home during the week day we will normally have sex in the middle of the day so the kids aren’t home. Part of me wants to just tell him to find his perfect girl, but then I get so sad that, that’s not me and I’m not good enough for him and he will find that. I know I can always be more affectionate and initiate more maybe I am the problem 😞 I’m tired of crying and feeling like I will never be good enough. ",4,1743389261.0,Marriage,15,0.7,False
1jntfq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1jntfq4/the_butcher_on_barker_street_pt_12/,The Butcher on Barker Street [Pt. 1/2],"The call came in a little after three in the morning. When I reached over to the nightstand, I accidentally knocked over my alarm clock. It crashed to the ground, shattering into jagged shards of plastic and glass. Not a good way to start the day.

I answered the phone. “Look, whoever this is, you owe me a new alarm clock.”

“Get over here.” I recognized Troy’s voice immediately. “We have a problem.”

“A please would be appreciated.”

“Stow the snark, James,” he said. “This is serious.”

I looked around my empty bedroom. There were piles of clothes strewn about the floor, along with old gin bottles and spent cigarette butts. Last night was a haze of loud music and endless drinking. I couldn’t be sure, but my breath said I’d ordered a pizza too.

Looking down at the bits of plastic and glass, I said, “Fine, but while I got ya on the line, let me tell you a little about this new alarm clock you’re gonna buy me.”

While I got dressed, I went on and on about the clock. I wanted one that could connect to the internet, play music, and use Bluetooth. Troy was quiet as I rambled, and when I was finished, he said: “I’m at a brownstone on thirty-second. Apartment twenty-five. Move your ass, we’re burning daylight.”

Outside the bedroom window, the sky was dark and amassed with clouds. There wasn’t daylight yet to burn.

The call disconnected, and I pocketed my cell phone. I swiped my jacket from the floor. There was a slight bulge in the breast pocket. My cigarettes were still there. Then, I grabbed my keys, wallet, and handgun from the dresser. On the way out, I stopped in the bathroom to brush my teeth, but even after relentlessly scrubbing with cheap cinnamon-flavored toothpaste, my breath still smelled like greasy pizza and gin.

Some things never come out no matter what you do.

Driving to the south side of town, I found the brownstone Troy had told me about and stepped inside. The inner walls were white and barren save a few odd holes and yellow cigarette stains. The carpet was fuzzy and mottled by discolored blotches. I’m not one to judge, my place wasn’t much better. The rent was a little more expensive because I lived on the east side, but otherwise, they were pretty much the same.

In the city, in life, you’ve got to do whatever it takes to get by. Even if it means living in rat-infested apartments where neighbors blared screamo music and there was asbestos in the walls.

Climbing two flights of stairs, I knocked twice on the door to apartment twenty-five. Footsteps thundered from inside, followed by the rattle of a chain-lock being disarmed. The door opened, and Troy peered out at me through a crack in the door.

“This better be good,” I said, rubbing the exhaustion from my eyes. “I was having a great dream—”

“Yeah, yeah. You can tell me about it later,” he said, throwing the door open and pulling me inside. He slammed the door shut behind us, locking it again. “Word of warning, situation’s a little tricky.”

In our line of work, when wasn’t it “tricky”?

Troy had your typical bouncer look. Broad-shouldered, short blond hair, lantern jaw, built like a linebacker. He wore dark denim pants and a grimy leather jacket with more years on it than most cars.

He was the kind of guy Mr. Rousseau liked to keep for the first half of the day because he was well-read and personable. Intimidating at first glance, but in private company, he was quiet and reserved. These were the hours Mr. Rousseau handled the legitimate side of the business.

Plus, mornings and early afternoons were the only hours that worked for Troy’s schedule since he had a wife and two kids.

“Wait a minute.” Troy leaned in close and sniffed. “Are you drunk?”

“Not entirely.”

“What the fuck, James! It’s a Thursday.”

“Yeah, and Mr. Rousseau usually has me on at night. So, why the hell am I being called in at three in the morning?”

He gestured for me to follow as he started down the narrow hallway. I didn’t recognize the apartment. Mr. Rousseau lived on the north side of town, and Troy had a house on the west side. The south side of the city was reserved for addicts, deadbeats, and broke college kids. There weren’t many in Rousseau’s personal circle that fit the bill.

We turned at the corner and followed the rest of the hallway to a closed door. Troy hesitated with his hand on the knob, looking over his shoulder at me. There were shadows in his eyes. Despair. He sighed and turned the knob, pushing the door open. Instantly, before I even entered the bedroom, I could taste the metal and copper in the air. Smell the early stages of decay.

If something like that doesn’t wake you up, nothing will.

The bedroom was a dingy space with splintered floorboards and a sagged ceiling. Next bad rainstorm would probably knock out a few tiles. The furniture was ancient and dilapidated. In the far corner, an old boxy TV displayed a screen of black-and-white fuzz, hissing quietly in the background as we examined the scene.

“What the fuck happened?” I asked.

Any semblance of drunkenness had abandoned me, replaced by a stone-cold sobriety that made me want to scream or punch something.

“There was an incident,” Troy said haphazardly. Always the professional. “It’s a bit complicated.”

That was one way of putting it.

On the queen-sized bed was a partially naked girl lying limp on the mattress. Sheets and blankets swirled around her, splattered in blood. Her limbs were splayed at odd angles, lifeless. The back of her head was caved open with a jagged rim of exposed skull peering out through her long black hair. I kneeled to inspect the wound, thinking Troy had maybe brought me in for amateur medical attention. I’d spent the first eighteen years of my life working on a farm, caring and tending to animals. Whenever I wasn’t slaughtering them.

Adjusting the head of a nearby lamp on the nightstand, a bright yellow light shined against the top of the girl’s head. Her injury was untreatable in given circumstances. Blunt-force trauma with noticeable swelling and severe hemorrhaging. The skin was ruddy red with a slight undertone of blue. There were tiny bits of bone, hair, and flesh amongst the exposed grey matter of her brain.

I almost suggested a hospital in the area, but reality dawned on me. I would’ve been better off suggesting a morgue.

Then, as I was examining the wound, the girl’s brain began to shift beneath the undulating pool of blood. For a moment, I thought she might open her eyes and sit up in bed. This expectation died in its cradle as I watched a fly crawl out from the mixture of blood and membrane. Its wings fluttered a few times, and once they were clean, it took off into the air.

I quickly turned away, gagging against last night’s dinner. Shouldn’t have had so much pizza or gin, but I’m a creature of habit.

“Seriously,” I stammered, leaning against the wall, staring down at my shoes, desperately trying not to think about the dead girl, “what the fuck happened?”

“I already told you: there was an incident.”

“Yeah, no shit there was an incident.”

“It was an accident, James.”

You don’t get an injury like that from an accident unless it involves a head-on collision or a flight of stairs.

“Oh, an accident? That makes it so much better.” I glimpsed at the girl again, my heart swelling with a mixture of disgust and pity. “Is she dead?”

I don’t know why I asked. She had the pale complexion of a corpse. The putrid stink of a corpse. Probably had the sour taste of one too.

Troy shrugged. “My gut tells me she’s most likely dead.”

“Most likely?”

“No, yeah, she’s dead.” He considered this for a moment before nodding. “Definitely dead. Mr. Rousseau clubbed her over the head with an ashtray.”

I exhaled carefully. “That oughta do it.” I reached inside my jacket pocket and removed a pack of Viceroy cigarettes, lighting one the instant it met my lips. “Why’d he do it?”

“Lost his cool for a second.”

“Really? Only for a second.”

Troy threw his hands up defensively. “Look, I was just chillin’ in the living room, reading a book, when I heard her scream. By the time I got in here, well, it was finished.”

 “Did he say anything?”

“He wants us to clean it up.”

“No shit, Sherlock. I mean, did he say anything about why he did it?”

Troy scoffed. “He actually wrote a ten-page essay about it if you’re interested in reading it.”

I considered punching him, but the only reason Troy and I had lasted as partners was because we knew not to take it out on each other. We had an unspoken policy: ‘Just do the job and get out. No questions asked.’ In situations like that, though, it was hard to refrain from asking any questions.

“Well,” I said, slowly regaining my equilibrium with the help of nicotine calming my nerves, “where the hell is Rousseau?”

“Don’t worry about it. I called some guys to take him back to his penthouse. But we’ve gotta fix this fast. The girl has a roommate. She’s outta town right now, but she’ll be back around noon.”

“We’re so fucked.”

“Not if we move fast,” Troy promised. “I’ve already got it figured out. I’ll stay here and clean up the mess. I just need you to take care of the body.”

“Fuck you. I’m not driving a dead body through the city at three in the morning. I’ll stay and clean up the scene. You can deliver the girl.”

“I can’t.”

“Why not?”

“I don’t have a license.”

“Hasn’t stopped you before.”

“My tags are expired too.”

That’s when it hit me. “Oh, fucking forget about it! We’re not putting a dead girl in the trunk of my car.”

“Why not?”

“Because it’s my personal vehicle, dumbass.”

“It’s a minivan, not a Maserati.”

“It’s still my car. I’m not letting you fuck it up.”

“It’s what soccer moms use to drive their kids to school. A little blood isn’t going to ruin it.”

I started pacing back and forth across the room. Floorboards creaked beneath my feet. The nicotine was making me sick, and my sleep deprivation wasn’t helping either.

Troy groaned, exasperated. “Will you please just be cool about this? We don’t have time to bicker like an old married couple. We need to get this fixed. Now!”

“Son of a bitch!” I kicked the wall. Dried paint chips fell to the floor. “Okay, alright, fine! What’s the play?”

“I’ve got some plastic wrap and a few blankets. We’ll bundle her up, carry her downstairs, and load her into the trunk. Then, you’ll take her to one of the usual spots.”

By ‘usual spots’ he meant one of the local businesses we used to dispose of bodies. There were a few throughout the city, but my go-to was Mason and Sons, a funeral home on the north side of town. Mason was a pleasant man, despite his affiliation with someone like Mr. Rousseau. And his means of disposal was perhaps the most humane I could think of. Better than the scrapyard or the butcher shop.

We exited the apartment, went downstairs, and stepped out into the parking lot. Troy’s car was near the back corner, far away from the rest. He opened the truck and removed the top panel. Beneath, where there should’ve been a spare tire, was instead a cache of random supplies for situations like this. Handcuffs, duct tape, zip ties, trash bags, bleach, soap, ammonia, disinfectant wipes, paper towels, and whatever else.

I almost made a joke about how maybe he should be driving the minivan, but I couldn’t get the thoughts from my mind to my tongue without wanting to puke. So, I just silently smoked my cigarette instead.

Back in the apartment, we gathered everything covered in blood into one of the trash bags. We also threw in some of the girl’s personal belongings like her wallet, keys, and cell phone. Troy took whatever excess cash from her purse, asking me if I wanted to split it.

“You fuckin’ scumbag,” I muttered.

“Oh, forgive me, Prince Charming,” he said. “Some of us got bills to pay.”

“More like alimony.”

Troy cuffed me on the shoulder for that one. In this line of work, it was hard to have a family. Especially on nights when you had to gaze into the emaciated face of a young dead girl, trying not to think of your daughter or wife.

You have to lie to yourself. Detach yourself from the situation. Pretend that you can still be the good guy, but ultimately, guilt always resurfaces. Usually late at night, while you’re in bed, listening to the silence of the world around you, staring up at the shadows on the ceiling like ink blots on a Rorschach test.

I see a happy little dog, you might say. I see a pretty pink pony. I see the shattered skull of a young woman. I see the maggots wriggling around inside her brain. I see myself protecting the man who killed her because I’m just a dog on a leash.

Guys like us develop hobbies to distract ourselves from the silence, from the memories. Troy was a frequent reader of everything and anything. I’d seen him consume more books than a librarian. Once, I even caught him reading the dictionary because he didn’t have any other novels on hand.

For me, I liked to drink and smoke. It helped me sleep. Helped me clear my mind. When I wasn’t drinking, I was working.

My occupation was a complicated matter. If that weren’t already apparent. I usually followed Mr. Rousseau around like a good lil’ pup, going all across the city to visit underground clubs, bars, and other late-night establishments with morally questionable exchanges.

If I wasn’t acting as Mr. Rousseau’s bodyguard or personal assistant, I was off collecting debts and payments. That, or I was delivering packages. Most of the time, I had no clue what these packages contained, but I had my assumptions: narcotics, money, evidence, and so on.

Once, I had to deliver a sphere-shaped package wrapped in duct tape and plastic. I kept telling myself it was a basketball or soccer ball, but my gut told me otherwise. That was the first time I’d met the Butcher. When I handed him the package, he licked his lips and said: “This will do just fine.”

I avoided the butcher when at all possible.

By the time Troy and I finished collecting personal belongings, we had two bags full. I delivered those to the trunk of my car, and when I returned, Troy already had the girl enveloped in cellophane. We were somewhat skilled in the trade of making a person disappear.

We wrapped the girl in a few blankets and quilts. One of them was pink and had the word “Barbie” scrawled across it in swooping letters.

“So,” I said, “your daughter fell out of her doll phase then?”

“That’s what happens when you get them a cell phone.”

The last time we did this, we used blankets designed with monster trucks and Spongebob. His son had just turned eleven and got an Xbox with games like Call of Duty and Halo.

Once the blankets were in place, we secured them with duct tape. Then, after checking the apartment hallways, we carried the body to the parking lot. The sun was just starting to peer over the horizon, but morning traffic still hadn’t hit yet.

With the body inside, Troy shut the trunk and sighed. “You gonna take her to the Butcher?”

“No,” I said, a little too quickly to be impartial on the matter. “Mason’s place.”

“Butcher is closer.”

“She’s going to Mason. End of story.”

He shrugged and checked his watch. “Better get moving before he gets busy then.”

“No, shit,” I said, climbing into the car and starting the engine. “Have fun, Mr. Clean.”

Grumbling, he waved me away and headed back towards the building.

“I’m serious about that alarm clock,” I called out after him. “It better be expensive and brand-new.”

Troy flipped me off over his shoulder and disappeared inside. I shifted into drive and started across the city, careful to obey the speed limit and stop at all traffic lights. The last thing I needed was to catch any unwanted attention.

While I was driving, my hands began to shake. The road oscillated in front of me, fusing with the night sky. Stars blurred and coalesced into a single bright light of fluorescent white. I rubbed my eyes and searched the glove box, returning with a hand-sized bottle of gin. It steadied my nerves, placating the adrenaline coursing through my veins.

A man without his medicine goes a little mad from time to time.

At Mason and Sons Funeral Home, I parked in the back. I tried calling him, but it went straight to voicemail. So, I climbed the back steps to the rear entrance and knocked. It took a few minutes, but eventually, his wife appeared. Her smile vanished, and she looked at me with discernible disgust.

“It’s four-thirty in the morning,” she growled.

“Nice to see you too, Shelia,” I replied, affecting a delicate tone. She, like many others, preferred Troy over me, but she could’ve probably gone the rest of her life without ever speaking to either one of us again. “Mason here?”

She stepped aside, waving me inside. “He’s in the back office. Be quick about it. We’ve got a family coming in at five.”

“You could try to be a little nicer. Mr. Rousseau pays to keep the fuckin’ lights on in this place, y’know.”

Her scowl deepened, forming lines across her forehead, accentuating the hollow crevices around her sunken eyes. She reeled back and slapped me across the face. “Make it snappy, you rat fuck, and get the hell outta here.”

“Fair enough.”

I rubbed the sting from my cheek and moved down the hallway. That’s where I bumped into two of Mason’s sons. I didn’t remember their names, and they probably didn’t remember mine either. But we were familiar with each other.

A while back, Mr. Rousseau made me retrieve the older one from a crack den on the south side while the kid was on a bender. I had to fend off two different dealers and a Chihuahua that wouldn’t stop nipping at my heels.

Because of the younger son, I had to visit a few families on the north side with a large cash settlement to keep them silent about something involving their teenage daughters. I don’t know all the details, but the little bastard wasn’t allowed to interact with any of the grieving customers who came in. Probably for the best, all things considered.

The sons nodded at me and left. I continued down the hall into the back office. Inside, Mason sat behind his desk with a cup of coffee in one hand and a manilla file in the other. He flipped through pages, squinting through a pair of tiny spectacles that were comically small. I had to wonder if he could even see through them.

Despite his kids, Mason was a decent person. As far as humans are concerned. He reminded me of my grandfather. An old oak tree slowly wilting while the rest of the forest was chopped down to make room for new shops and apartments. Just a man trying to stay afloat, willing to do whatever it took to keep his family safe and secure.

Mason glanced up at me and smiled. “James, I wasn’t expecting you.”

“Sorry, Mason,” I said. “I tried to call, but there was no answer.”

“Phone’s in the other room.” He set his coffee down and closed the folder. Leaning forward on his desk, he clasped his hands together and asked, “What can I do for you, my boy?”

He was from a different generation where people said things like “my boy” or “simmer down” or on occasion, such as when I brought his son home from the drug den, “damn shame” while shaking his head.

I sat in the chair across from him and explained the situation, what little I knew. When I was finished, Mason took off his spectacles, pinched the bridge of his nose, and exhaled. He tried to smooth back the wispy grey hair on his head, but there were so few left that they refused to obey.

“The situation’s a bit muddled,” I told him, affecting Troy’s professionalism. “We’re tryin’ to get it cleaned up as soon as possible. So, if you have anything, I would appreciate it. And I’m sure Mr. Rousseau would appreciate it too.”

Whenever dealing with these people, you have to throw out Mr. Rousseau’s name as much as possible. It’s the only way to get them to treat you seriously. The only way to keep their attention. Otherwise, you’re just a rat fuck. A dog without an owner.

“Let me see,” Mason said, flipping through a large black ledger. With every page, he licked his pruney fingers and hummed. “Hmm. Damn shame…damn shame. Young girl, was it?”

“Yes, sir. Not as young as you might think, but younger than either of us. Late teens, early twenties maybe. I’m guessing a college student. Maybe a part-time escort.”

Rousseau met most of his paramours late at night while wandering the city’s underbelly. Dancers at the clubs and waitresses at the bars. A repetitive routine that usually worked in his favour.

“And how’d it happen?” Mason asked.

I hesitated. My tongue wouldn't form the words. “Uh, probably for the best that you don’t know, sir.”

He chuckled. It was easy to approach these situations with a bit of humor when you weren’t looking at the corpse. Even someone like Mason, who’d been embalming and burying bodies since before I could drive, would probably feel faint at the sight of that girl. He’d clutch his metaphorical pearls and blink back tears. Maybe spend the afternoon in his office, drinking from the bottle of bourbon he kept in the bottom drawer.

“How soon would you need a hole?” Mason asked without looking up from his agenda.

“Today, if possible.”

The way Mason and Sons worked was we would deliver a body a few hours before a funeral. They would dig the grave about four or five feet deeper than usual, and we would drop the dead body inside. Then, we’d cover them up with a few inches of dirt, just enough to conceal the corpse. Once the funeral was done, they would transport the coffin and drop it down on top of the other corpse before sealing up the grave.

When the body was taken care of, they burned all evidence and possessions in their industrial furnace. At least, that’s what they told me, but the last time I visited, his younger son was sporting a new wristwatch that seemed vaguely familiar.

“I’m sorry to tell ya,” Mason said, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms across his chest, “but we just don’t have any open graves right now. If you can hold onto the body for a few more days, we might have availability this weekend.”

“We’ve got nowhere to store it until then.”

He cocked an eyebrow. “Where is she now?”

“My trunk.”

Mason blanched and reached for his coffee, his hand trembling as he lifted the mug to his lips. “Sweet Baby Jesus! You’ve got her with you as we speak? That’s what you’re tellin’ me?”

“Yes, sir. Unfortunately. Like I said, it’s a bit of a SNAFU.”

“No kiddin’, my boy.” He rubbed the few strands of hair on his chin. “I’m sorry. I wish I could help, but my hands are tied.”

I feigned nonchalance, but in reality, my heart was pounding against my chest. Sweat beaded on the back of my neck. I kept thinking about that dead girl, the hole in her skull, the stew of bone shards and hair inside her head. I needed to get rid of her, to get her out of my trunk so I could go back home, drink myself stupid, and fall asleep. Forget the day, let another replace it.

“You alright?” Mason asked me. “Can I get you a coffee or a cup of tea?”

“No, but thank you, sir.” I had gin waiting for me back in the car. “I should probably get going.”

“You know, I’m surprised to see you again. Thought you would’ve taken your leave by now. That was the plan, wasn’t it?”

“Yes, sir, but things changed. Thought I’d have my debts paid by now, but the bills never stop coming.”

He laughed. “You can say that again.”

Last winter, my father took a spill down the stairs and hit his head. While my mother was doing her best to sell the farm, there were no buyers. It was taking every last penny to keep her afloat while she waited for the life insurance policy to kick in. Bureaucrats always found a way to slow down the process.

I stood from my chair, shook Mason’s hand, and left. His wife followed me out the door, giving me one last glare before slamming the door shut.

When I got back in the car, I was overcome by the putrid stink of decay. I could practically taste the withering flesh, taste the metallic tinge of her blood in my mouth despite the layers of plastic and blankets. There must’ve been a hole or something. A part that wasn’t covered.

I rolled down the window and turned on the AC. Then, I retrieved my phone from my pocket and dialed Troy’s number.

Three rings before he answered. “Everything taken care of?”

“Not quite.”

“Great, what now?”

“Mason doesn’t have any open graves at the moment.”

“Guess you’ll have to go to the Butcher,” Troy said.

My blood turned cold, and I squeezed the steering wheel, digging my nails into the pleather. “No way! I’m not going to the Butcher.”

“Quit being such a baby and just do it.”

“The guy is a fuckin’ freakshow! I’m not going there alone.”

“Well, I’m a little preoccupied at the moment.” Troy took a deep breath and sighed. “You could try Davis’s Scrapyard. I don’t have his number, so you’ll have to drive over. He should be in by now.”

I wanted to smash my phone against the dashboard. Mr. Rousseau paid well, but in some situations, it wasn’t enough. Rock and a hard place, I guess.

“Whatever,” I said, exasperated. “Just hurry up with the apartment.”

“It’d go a lot faster if you didn’t call.”

I hung up and tossed the phone into the passenger seat. My foot pressed against the accelerator, turning the faint glow of street lights into a hazy smear of orange and yellow. Rain pattered across the windshield, and the rubber wipers squeaked against the glass. My hands fidgeted about the wheel, trembling whenever they didn’t have something stable to grasp onto. I reached into my pocket for another cigarette.

By the time I arrived at the scrapyard, I was stifling a gag between clenched teeth. The car reeked of burning tobacco and death. You could soak the inside with bleach, but the smell still wouldn’t go away.

Parking at the front gate, I found Davis in the main trailer, drinking a beer and throwing files into a trash can. He glanced over his shoulder at me, brow already furrowed, eyes bloodshot with fatigue.

“Nah,” he said. No hesitation, no fear. “Sorry, James, but I can’t.”

“You don’t even know why I’m here.”


“Don’t need to, buddy. If you’re here, it’s prob’ly something bad.” He emptied an entire drawer of files into the trash can before tossing it aside. “Trust me, this is the last place you wanna be.”

“And why’s that?”

“Last week, cops busted one of my garages. They’ve been watching my every move ever since. Whatever you’re here for, I doubt you want to get me involved.”

Davis operated several chop shops across the city. On the surface, they were any other garage, but in the back, they were stripping stolen cars for spare parts. Not exactly the worst of Mr. Rousseau’s colleagues, but his operation was big and turned quite a profit. An influential man to have in your pocket.

His scrapyard was convenient when it came to dead bodies. They had the kind of machinery that could crush a vehicle into a tiny cube. Imagine what it did to a corpse. Plus, there was plenty of land to bury bodies, and plenty of rubbish to hide the stink of rotting humans.

He scoffed. “Maybe I’m not speaking clearly, but the cops are investigating me. They’re looking into every single thing I do. Dead girl is just what they need to get a warrant. Shit, screw the warrant, that would be enough for probable cause. We’d both be in cuffs, buddy. Is that what you want?”

I have no real friends, I know my husband's friends and their wives/gfs but our interactions are very limited, we only talk or see each other when my husband and his friends plan to do something, so literally I only have my husband.

Hey everyone,

I have an issue regarding our Mahlkönig GBW 65S back at our coffee shop is and I can’t figure out what’s wrong. After cleaning it, I noticed that it started dosing more than what’s displayed on the screen. 

For example, if I set it to 15g, it actually dispenses around 18g (sometimes more, sometimes less) which is weird and doesn't make any sense. This issue appeared immediately after cleaning, even though I didn’t adjust the burrs at that time. 

Later, I adjusted the burr distance to try and fix the issue, but now my shot times are inconsistent with the draw time , sometimes overaectracted and sometimes under-extracted. On top of that, my grinds now come out clumpy if I grind fine. 
I’ve checked the settings menu, but it’s complicated, and I can’t find anything about recalibrating the GBW scale or resetting the grinder. I also tried power cycling (turning it off and unplugging), but it didn’t help. I checked for retention issues by grinding multiple doses, but the inconsistency remains.

I(13) live with my mom, dad (Sometimes. Hes a truck driver.), Aunt, and Uncle. My mom and dad are both disabled my dad not as much as my mom. But everytime i go outside of my room my mom or dad asks me to do a million things at once. Its not like I have to clean the whole house by myself but they tell me to make coffee, clean our ferrets cage, feed and water the pets, ect-. It may not seem like a lot but it is sometimes. They treat me like a maid and like im just some no body that is just here for their personal things. 

For some background on my mom, My brothers were taken from her before i was born for reasons out of her control (she is NOT the reason they were) and i have known since i was 3. my dad is not my biological dad and ive also known that since i was 3. im not mad at her for that, though i am mad at her for telling me so young as now i have waited since then for my brothers who i have never met to be able to come to us. she is a good mom and all its just every time im anywhere outside of my room im asked to do like a million things. she rarely tells me she loves me and i know she does it just feels like she only sees me as a maid sometimes. 

around 2 weeks ago now my dad tried to hug me and i pushed him away because i didnt want to be touched right then and i HAD TOLD HIM that (for personal reasons i will not say why but i promise its not him lol), later, my mom came into my room and yelled at me saying ""IF HE K1LLS H1MS3LF BECAUSE OF THIS I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY!!!"".

1jnt7v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jnt7v7/i_brought_something_back_with_me_from_my_trip_to/,I brought something back with me from my trip to Europe. (Part 1),"When I graduated college, my friends and I decided to go on a trip to both celebrate our accomplishment and mourn the fact that we were officially leaving adolescence and entering the ”real world”. We decided to go on a backpacking trip to Europe as it seemed to be the only place that we could all agree on and was perfectly cliche for a group of (former) college students. We were all experienced hikers and had traveled virtually everywhere in the U.S., so we thought Europe would be a nice change of scenery. Not a lot of planning went into our trip, we just had a vague idea of what we wanted to do. Fly into Denmark, end up in Switzerland, staying in youth hostels along the way. We had set aside a month for the entire trip so we weren't stressed about having a coordinated agenda or planned stops, we just wanted to get drunk at every bar and do things that caught our interest along the way. 



The beginning of our trip went as expected. We flew into Copenhagen and immediately went out to the nearest bar. For the next month, we made our way south through Hamburg, to Hanover, to Frankfurt, and finally to Zurich. Our trip was filled with hiking, drinking, sightseeing, and a few drug-fueled experiences that now seem hazy in my memory. Everything was what I was expecting from the trip until we got to Zurich. When doing the little planning we did before embarking, the one thing that we did plan was our flights. When we arrived in Zurich, it was a few days before our scheduled return flight home. Being at the end of a month-long bender, none of us really felt like continuing partying and decided to go on a short hike in the Swiss Alps before our return trip. 



Not all of us went on the hike. Out of the 5 in total who went on the trip, only 3 including me decided they wanted to see the alps. The two who went with me were my friends Henry and Kyle. To get to the alps, we had to ride a train for about 2 hours. The image of the mountains towering over me as we stood at their base is imprinted in my mind. The smell of the fir trees, the quiet ambience only interrupted by the chirping of birds and the rustle of the leaves. It was truly serene, and Henry, Kyle, and I silently agreed to not disturb the peace with conversation as we started our way up the trail. Even though we were experienced hikers, we were not planning on climbing to the summit of any mountain, but as we continued down the trail at relatively the same altitude, it got cold. Very cold. 



“Do you guys also feel chilly?” Henry asked us.



I turned around to see him shivering in his t-shirt and shorts.



“Yeah it feels like way colder than when we started.” I replied.



We had set out for our day trip at around 11:00 AM and had only been hiking for about an hour, so it should have been getting warmer if anything. We didn’t really think anything of it as we all had sweaters in our backpacks for when it got chilly at night. In Switzerland the temperature in June, when we were there, is around 55 degrees Fahrenheit at the coldest, but we could tell it was getting much colder than that. Still, we decided to keep going since the route we were taking would take around 8 hours to complete, putting us back at the base of the mountain at around 7:00 PM, just before the sun set. About an hour later, clouds started to move in, blocking out the sun and making it even colder. The wind was picking up too, adding to the already plummeting temperature. I could tell that it was easily close to, if not already, freezing now. When we set out this morning, the forecast said that it would be sunny all day, with no clouds in the sky. 



“Guys, maybe we should just turn back now. It’s getting really cold and it looks like it might rain.” Kyle said. 



“Yeah it's getting mad uncomfortable and I don’t want to be cold and soaked.” Henry added.



“Yeah alright, let’s head back. I'm cold as hell too.” I agreed.

“Let me just take a piss real quick, I’ve been chugging water all morning.”



I was disappointed that our excursion didn’t go as planned, but was looking forward to getting out of the cold. I went off the path to relieve myself behind a tree. After finding a nice pine, I unzipped and did my business. Looking up, I noticed a strange symbol carved into the tree slightly above my head. It looked like an owl head with a cross marked in its forehead. I figured somebody got bored doing what I was doing right now and decided to doodle it into the tree, maybe hoping to scare the next pisser. I zipped back up and headed back to the trail to meet up with my fellow hikers, but when I got back to the trail I didn’t see them. 



“Guys?” I said, slightly above my normal talking volume.

“Alright, very funny guys!” I shouted.

“I guess y’all are gonna jump out and scare me now?”



No response.



“Guys?” I tried again, looking around to see if I just didn’t see them when I was walking back. 



I was only met with the howl of the wind and the swaying of the trees. Without any other explanation, I told myself that Henry and Kyle just ditched me as a prank and already started back to the trail head. It felt wrong to me though, I knew that they wouldn't do that to me, especially since we were hiking in a new place and the weather was so rapidly degrading. They wouldn’t leave me alone, even as a joke. I swallowed this doubt and started back towards the foot of the mountain, determined to save myself from the cold and hoping to find my friends along the way. 



Throughout the afternoon, the clouds above me grew denser, darker, until it felt like dusk. Trudging through the cold, windy afternoon it felt like knives were striking my skin every time the wind picked up, tearing my skin apart. After walking for what seemed like an eternity, I checked my watch to gauge how far I was from the trail head and the sweet warmness of the train ride home. It read “2:53 PM”. We had turned around at about 1:00 PM and had started at 11:00 AM, so I should be reaching the beginning of the trail soon I figured. As I read the numbers on my watch, a white flake landed right on the time display. I picked it up with my finger and it melted almost instantly. I looked up to see hundreds of snowy, white flakes falling from the deep, dark gray sky. A feeling of panic and dread filled my stomach. 



“How could it be snowing in the middle of June?” I thought to myself.

“Thank God I’m almost out of here.”



I was hoping with everything in my being that Henry and Kyle would be waiting for me when I got back, standing next to the warm train, waving me inside. However, as I continued down the path, my hope slowly evaporated. I walked for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 45 minutes, still no trail head in sight.



“I should be right by the train by now.” I told myself.

“Did I walk the wrong way when I finished pissing earlier? Did I somehow go back to the wrong trail? Where am I?”



I was starting to panic. Snow was still falling and each crunch under my boot slowly weathering my assurance that I would see my friends or the train again. My feet and my legs were growing numb. I had nothing but my shorts and a sweater to protect me from the unforgiving cold. Still, I kept walking. Eventually, the clouds grew so dark I had to take out my flashlight so I could see the path better. I looked down at my watch, expecting it to be close to sunset. “4:12 PM” it read. I figured even if I did walk the wrong way, I would still end up at the trailhead by 7:00 PM since that’s how long the entire hike would have taken. I continued, each minute growing more and more scared of the reality I was in. Snow was building on the ground, the wind and the cold had still not given up. Each minute had the weight of a freight train, pounding into my body. Luckily, I wasn’t entirely stupid and had packed food and water for the journey, so I would still have my strength to continue. As the afternoon turned into the evening, 7:00 PM came and went and the trailhead was still nowhere in sight. My panic grew with each step I took. It was pitch black now, almost a complete absence of light. We weren’t expecting to stay the night up here, so I hadn’t packed a tent or many camping supplies, just a sleeping bag. 



I started coming to terms with the fact that I would probably have to spend the night out here in nothing but a thin sleeping bag when I saw a light up ahead of me. I felt my heart skip a beat, thinking it was another hiker. At least I won’t be out here alone. Maybe they had some camping gear or at least extra clothes so I wouldn’t freeze to death. However, as I made my way towards the beckoning light, it turned into multiple lights, yellow and warm. I finally got in range to tell what it was, not another hiker, but a cabin. I didn’t have time or the luxury to think about all the warnings I was given by Grimm’s fairy tales in my youth to think twice about approaching this lone cabin in the middle of the Swiss Alps. As I quickly walked towards the cabin, I thanked God with every step and thought about the warmth that would bathe me as I entered the cabin. The cabin appeared rustic, like Paul Bunyan built it himself. There was a big, cast iron knocker on the door. I reached to pick it up to knock, but the door flew open before I even touched it. Greeting me was a tiny, old woman. 



“What are you doing out there in the cold?” She asked in a sweet, comforting voice.

“Come in sweetie, you’re gonna freeze to death!”



“Thank you so much.” I blurted out as I quickly entered the safe haven of the cabin. 



The crackling of a fire met my ears at the same time its warmth covered me. A flood of relief entered my body and mind with the assurance that I would not freeze to death tonight. This only lasted for a minute as I was reminded of Henry and Kyle.



“Are my friends here? Have you seen them?” I automatically asked.



“No, sweetheart, you’re the only soul we’ve seen.” The old woman said with concern in her voice.

“Come in dear, sit down, do you want some coffee? Tea?” 



“Sure, uh coffee please. You’re sure you haven’t seen anyone else tonight?”



I wandered over to the fireplace and sat down on the old sofa, next to the rocking chair. As I glanced over to the chair, I was shocked to see an old man occupying it. I hadn’t seen him when I entered.



“Positive, dear. Your friends probably had enough sense to get off the mountain when it started snowing.” She chuckled.

“What are you doing on the mountain in this weather anyway?”



“I got turned around and couldn’t find my way back to the trailhead.” I said as she handed me my coffee.

“I’m glad I found this place, I thought I was gonna freeze to death for a minute out there.” I took a sip of the coffee. It felt like ecstasy as it dripped down my throat, warming my insides.

“Is it normal for it to snow like this in the middle of June?”



“I remember only one time since I’ve lived here that it’s snowed in Summer. It was many many years ago, when I was about your age. As you can tell I’m not from here,” She smiled.



It hadn’t occurred to me when I was being rescued from the icy cold, but she spoke with an American accent. 



“Oh yes, now that you mention it.” I said between sips of coffee.

“Where are you from?”



“I’m from a little town in Kansas called Columbus. I moved here right after I finished college. I met my dear husband over there on a trip me and my friends took and I’ve been in love with him ever since.” She smiled at her husband who in return continued to rock in his chair as if he hadn’t heard a word that was said.



“That’s sweet” I said to break the silence. 



“Even after all these years he refuses to learn English.”



The old man continued to stare blankly at the fire and rock back and forth in his chair.



“Could I use your phone? To call the park rangers about my friends. I haven’t been able to get cell service since I got to the mountains.” 



“Oh we don’t have a phone dear, we don’t use any electricity here. I’m really sorry about your friends, but you’re welcome to stay here tonight and I’m sure Wilhelm here will go with you in the morning to look for them.” She gestured to her blank husband.



“Oh uhh ok. Thank you. I really appreciate it.” I said with a concerned tone to my voice.



I finished my coffee and after a hot shower, the old lady led me to their guest room where I’d be staying the night. As I crossed the hall from the bathroom to the bedroom, I could see into the living room, Wilhelm was still rocking in his chair, staring at the fire. As I laid down in the bed, I could feel an itch in my throat, you know the kind you get before you get sick. I figured being out in the freezing cold for so long would probably give me something so I just took a preemptive ibuprofen from my backpack and laid down to sleep. 



That night, I awoke with terrible chills and my head pounding. The blanket that was draped over me was drenched with sweat. The ibuprofen I took before sleeping was the last one in my pack, so I wandered out of the bedroom, across the hall to the bathroom in search of more painkillers. I turned on the water and splashed some on my face. Opening the medicine cabinet, I was greeted with a very odd assortment of jars. They were filled with what looked like herbs and fungi. I figured since these people didn’t have electricity, they were probably the kind who grew their own natural remedies as well. The jars had labels on them that specified what they were and what they did. I searched for one marked painkiller or anti-inflammatory. Sure enough, there was one with just that inscribed with sharpie and masking tape. It had the appearance of some sort of mushroom. Cracking it open, a sharp and vulgar odor hit my nostrils. It smelled like burnt rubber. The scent immediately caused me to think twice about taking whatever this was. However, being in immense pain guided my decision more than the hideous smell of the mushroom. I made sure to write down the name of it before taking it though, so I could research it after rejoining civilization. When the fungi hit my tongue, the taste hit me like a truck, it was much worse than the smell and caused me to gag before choking it down. 



I drank an ample amount of water to try and wipe the memory of the taste from my mouth, but it persisted. The effects of the strange medicine were immediately noticeable. My body began to tingle and I became dizzy. Walking out of the bathroom to the bedroom, I took another look down the hallway to the living room and stopped dead in my tracks. The old man was no longer sitting in his chair. I could see only half of his body as the doorframe cut off my view from the rest of him, but I could tell that he was naked. I slowly made my way down the hallway towards the living room. The rest of the man’s body was revealed as I got closer and my viewpoint was no longer obstructed by the door frame. The old man was right in front of the fire, facing towards it. I continued into the living room.



“Hey dude, are you alright?” I said with a nervous quiver in my voice.



He muttered something quietly in German I assume, but I couldn’t hear what it was. Something about him caught my attention though and when I saw it, my stomach dropped. On the man’s left shoulder was the symbol of an owl with a cross on its forehead, the same one I had seen on the tree. The room started to spin, I got lightheaded and fell to the ground. When I regained consciousness, I was back in the bedroom, lying down on the bed. The only light provided in the room was coming from the hallway. I tried to sit up, but I couldn’t. It felt like in those dreams where you try to run, but you can’t, your body is too heavy. As much as I tried, I couldn’t move. My struggle was interrupted by several people entering my room. I could only see their silhouettes created by the warm, yellow light peering in through the doorway. Counting them, there were upwards of 15 people, all of them nude. Among them, I could make out the elderly couple. I tried to speak and ask them what was going on, but I couldn’t. They slowly gathered on either side of the bed and began to raise their arms above me. Once their arms were perpendicular to their bodies, they slowly got down on their knees. I could feel their cold touch all over me. Their hands were wet with some liquid that I can only assume was vinegar, as the smell was overpowering. All of a sudden, it felt as though the bed underneath me had dropped and I had the sensation of falling, like my chest was tied to an anvil and there was nothing below to stop it. My eyes rolled back into my head and my nervous system became overwhelmed.



I awoke what I presume to be the next morning to the pleasant touch of the sun warming my face. Immediately shooting up, I expected to see the mysterious figures from the night before, but I was shocked to find that I was laying in a patch of grass, my backpack to my right. It was a typical June day, the sun beaming down beating on my face. Warm, warmer than usual. No snow or any sign of snow around. My illness was seemingly gone, but I still felt drained from whatever happened. Shakily making my way to my feet, I scanned my surroundings, seeing that I was near a trail, but no cabin in sight. I put on my pack and walked towards the trail. The surroundings felt familiar, the rocks, the trees. As I approached the trail, the owl symbol I had seen earlier beamed from the tree, capturing all of my attention. I stopped mid-step and stared at the symbol, processing exactly what this meant. Questions raced through my mind. Had the occupants of the cabin carried me all the way back here? Had I gone in a big circle? Had I gone anywhere at all in the first place? I put my concerns to the side and turned my attention to what I wanted most at this point, to go home. I started down the path in the direction of where I initially thought the trailhead to be, determined to find it this time. After about 20 minutes of walking, I heard something out in the distance. 



“Trent! Treeent!”

I recognized the voice immediately. I quickened my pace toward the source of the shouting. 



“Henry!” I shouted in return.



Rounding the corner of the trail, I almost wept when I saw Henry and Kyle walking towards me. When they saw me, they began to run towards me while I stood frozen, awash with relief. 



“Where the fuck have you been dude?” Kyle said when they finally got close. 



“You wouldn’t believe it man, there was this cabin and these old naked people and I woke up in the grass and– wait what about you guys, where the fuck have *you* been.” 



“We’ve been looking for you dude, you disappeared yesterday after you went to go take a piss.” Henry said with frustration in his voice.



“No, you guys disappeared.” I retaliated.



“We’ve been shouting your name for the past 24 hours, walking up and down the trail. Where did you go?” Kyle asked.



“I tried walking back to the trailhead, I figured you guys ditched me as a joke or something and went on without me. How did y’all survive the snow, you guys didn’t pack tents or anything right?”



“What snow?” Henry asked, with a confused look on his face.



I returned his look with one of equal confusion.



“The snow. It started snowing yesterday after we split up.”



“What do you mean man?” Kyle chuckled.

“After we split up it got hotter, dude. It’s June, there’s not gonna be any snow up here.”



I explained the rest of my night to my friends, the cabin, the old couple, the ritual that was performed on me, but they didn’t believe me. They figured I was either lying or took too many mushrooms and had a bad trip or something. In reality, I wasn’t entirely sure what happened to me was real either, God knows I didn’t want it to be. 



We made our way back to the trailhead and after about an hour and a half were sitting on a train on our way back to Zurich. The suite was quiet the whole way back. We were all fatigued from this trip and were looking forward to being home. I was resting my head on the window sill, trying to somehow find sleep after the horrific experience I had just endured. I was recounting the events that happened in the cabin when I suddenly remembered writing down the name of the fungus that I took before everything happened. I pulled out the slip of paper it was scribbled on as well as my phone and quickly googled “Mycoterra Maleficium”. I tapped on the wikipedia article for it and scrolled through. “Should not be ingested, could cause hallucinations, vomiting, seizures, and diarrhea. Known for being the substance ingested during the 1974 mass suicide of the Black Dawn cult.” This was deeply concerning to say the least, I could feel myself start to sweat and my heart beat increase. How could I be that stupid to take a mushroom that I found in a stranger's house? I was livid with myself, but that was quickly replaced with fear. I clicked on the link for the Black Dawn on wikipedia and nearly dropped my phone when the page loaded. What else was going to greet me but the same owl symbol from the tree and the man’s back.

Did a misstake tonight.,"I quit all caffeine some days before new years in 2023, and before that I tapered down for a few months. It has been a success. I have gotten used to the good sleep and relaxed state of my nerve/anxiety/stress system. I am just a guy that does not use caffeine. I am not a guy that quit caffeine anymore. I am way past that. I have no desire to go back, the smell of coffee does not temt me a bit. Withdrawals is a distant memory.

I use to drink about 600 miligrams of caffeine in espressos and redbull a day before that all my grownup life. I am pushing 50 now.

So earlier tonight I bought my regular orange soda. 1.5 liters and have been sipping on that all night. Sinse 5-6 pm last night. All sunday night I did not feel very well. Lots of negative thoughts (I usually am pretty positive) and I have been kind of pacing around not knowing what to do with myself. I went for two latenight walks because I could not stay inside even though it was getting late. I have been worrying about small stuff all night, and have started and stopped with like 10 things, being to stressed and out of focus to stay on task. When bedtime came I was wide awake and did not even try to hit bed.

Then I saw it now 20 minutes ago. I had bought the wrong soda at the store. orange ""PLUSS"" version of the soda, not the regular one. 150 miligram of added caffeine pluss some energy drink stuff in it..

It is now 4.16 am, I am wide awake, and I still have the restless anxiety feeling in my body. God I am an idiot. Well at least I figured out why I have felt so out it and restless all night. And I have a monday morning that starts in a few hours, packed with work and plans. I wonder how the crash is going to be. No way I will sleep anything before I have to get going with the monday..

Good luck decaf quitters. For you people that is struggling, it IS temporary. The nasty withdrawals will go away. If you keep it up you will come to a point where coffee is not something you think about at all..

That was what I wanted to ramble on tonight..",8,1743388465.0,decaf,3,0.84,False
1jnt73n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSwordAndShield/comments/1jnt73n/is_cinderaces_design_really_that_bad/,Is Cinderace's design really that bad?,"Genuine question because I have seen a lot of people share their dislike for Cinderace and its design ever since the game was first released, and neither back then nor now do I understand what that is about.

The main issue people seem to have is that Cinderace looks too humanoid, in terms of body shape and movement...

This has always confused me because Cinderace was designed to be a football playing Pokemon, as soon as I heard footballers would inspire Cinderace I instantly knew it would have to be very humanoid for this to even work, is that not what everyone else expected? If Cinderace had a more animalistic body shape I very much doubt it would be able to tie well into it being able to kick pyro balls the way a footballer would kick a football.

I understand everyone is entitled to their opinions I just don't understand it, I've also heard people say that they can't imagine a Pokemon like Cinderace living in the wild due to its likeness to a human and that it feels unnatural...

But yet I haven't heard similar complaints when it comes to other humanoid Pokemon (which have been around since Gen 1 mind you) such as Lucario, Incineroar, Greninja, Inteleon, Hitmonchan, Gothitelle, Lopunny, the entire Machop line, the entire Ralts line, not to mention Throh and Sawk who have apparently incorporated human clothing into their anatomy? Same goes for Hitmonchan and Mega Lopunny...

Now I get that some of these look somewhat less humanoid than Cinderace in their body shape, but again I refer back to the fact that Cinderace is supposed to be able to move like a human, specifically like footballers, and that just would not work if Cinderace was less humanoid similarly to the aforementioned Pokemon.

Can you imagine Lopunny, the other humanoid bunny Pokemon being able to do what Cinderace was designed to do?

I'm guessing no, because Lopunny's posture and body shape is not suitable to pull off such skills.

I've also heard people mention that there's an episode in the Anime where a Cinderace puts on clothes and looks pretty human.

I saw the image, and sure if you don't pay attention to Cinderace's head it looks like a person, but Cinderace's head is the most animalistic part of its body and for a good reason, since the rest of the body is humanoid the head is what shows you hey this is a bunny.

This argument however doesn't do it for me either since you could chuck clothes on any of the other humanoid Pokemon I've mentioned and they'd all look just as humanoid some maybe even moreso.

And personally I don't see an issue with humanoid Pokemon, I think sometimes people forget that humans are animals too, and that there were many species such as Neanderthals and Homo Erectus etc, that looked incredibly similar to us, those species once lived in the wild prior to their extinction, and another thing sometimes people forget, we too as a species once lived 'in the wild', civilization wasn't always a think, nor were houses, apartments, villages or towns.

Do you still find it so hard to imagine a Cinderace living in the wild knowing that once we too lived in the wild? When you think about it this way Cinderace is just as much an animal as any other Pokemon because humans too are animals, and since a lot of Pokemon are based on animals wouldn't it stand to reason that some Pokemon be based on humans?

Cinderace is actually more animalistic than a lot of Pokemon because a lot of Pokemon are based on non living objects, e.g. a lot of steel types, rock types etc such as Metagross, Magnemite, Voltorb, Graveler etc.

These are all the arguments I've heard about Cinderace's design, if I've missed any feel free to let me know.

The reason I make this post is because I love Cinderace as a Pokemon, it's become one of my favourites since sword and shield...

Maybe I'm biased because I love football, and I almost exclusively prefer the fire type starters over the water and grass types, so maybe I was always going to love Cinderace no matter what? I chose Cinderace as my starter during my playthrough and it was so fun to use, I love its signature pyro ball it was always so fun to use, and Cinderace was just the ace in my team in general, I built a balanced and strong team and tried to evenly level all my mons but Cinderace was always leaps and bounds above all my other mons.

And I don't think I'm alone in this I think a lot of you probably experience the same thing but when I go through a playthrough I always grow very fond of the mons I used in my team, so after my playthrough I liked Cinderace as a mon even more.

Look I get that some people may see Cinderace as furry-bait (trust me I don't like this side of humanoid mons either), and I know some people think it looks so humanoid that its creepy, but when I look at Cinderace I just see a cute little bunny guy, that yes may look unnatural in the wild, but is the kind of mon that you can kick a ball around with, or even take to a cafe in the morning when it's time for your morning coffee.",0,1743388452.0,PokemonSwordAndShield,8,0.4,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the beautiful game, where Verona's defense is tighter than a pair of skinny jeans on Thanksgiving, and Parma's attack is about as threatening as a kitten with a feather. This Serie A showdown promises to be a nail-biter, or perhaps more of a yawn-inducer, depending on your perspective.

Verona has been on a roll, winning two recent matches against formidable foes. Their defense is like a fortress, and with Parma's offense being about as potent as decaf coffee, Verona's backline should hold firm. However, Verona's offense is not exactly setting the world on fire, averaging just one goal per game at home. It's like they're trying to win games with the soccer equivalent of a whisper.

Now, let's talk odds. Verona is favored with prices hovering around 2.4 to 2.5 across various sportsbooks, while Parma is the underdog at around 3.0 to 3.2. The draw is also a tempting option at similar odds. But let's face it, betting on Verona to win outright is riskier than trying to eat spaghetti with a spoon.

The real value here lies in the total goals market. With Verona's defense and Parma's lackluster attack, the under 2.5 goals bet is as appealing as a warm bowl of pasta on a cold day. Odds for under 2.5 goals are around 1.73 to 1.98, depending on where you place your bet. It's a safer bet than trusting your uncle to cook the turkey on Thanksgiving.

So, if you're looking to make a smart wager, put your money on under 2.5 goals. And if you're feeling adventurous, maybe sprinkle a little on the draw. After all, in the world of sports betting, sometimes the underdog—or in this case, the under-goal—wins the day.

There's a vegan friendly coffee shop near me. My ""yeah"" turned into ""oh"" when I saw the prices. $14 USD for a sandwich? No sides, just a sandwich? It better be big and stuffed then. Looking at the photos, it does look closer to a burger than a normal sandwich. The omni sandwiches are just a dollar cheaper. So I guess the place is just pricey in general.

While supermarket shopping, I only buy meat and cheese alternatives when they're on sale. The meat in particular tends to be *pricey* for how much food you get. I'll just buy a bag of soya chunks instead of using frozen crumbles or meat. The problem with vegan alternatives is that they don't go on sale like omni products do. I can find Kraft for $2 often, while the equivalent in vegan cheeses is $5-$8 for *fewer* slices.",6,1743388093.0,AskVegans,9,1.0,False

I’m having a really hard time dealing with it.,"So I’m 25f, I work as a bartender/waitress. Been working at the same spot for 4 years. This guy is a regular customer, but I have considered him somewhat of a friend because the place I work at is really quiet and he comes in after work multiple days a week and we will talk until late at night, he also would bring me my favourite coffee every once in a while so anyways, I consider him a friend.

3 months ago, he asked me out on a date. I nicely said no, I explained I can’t date because I have mental health issues I still need to work through, which was the truth. I don’t even think it would be fair to someone for me to be in a relationship with them.
I think this was my first mistake because he took it as a suggestion and kept insisting he’d help me.

I still said no and he tried every time he came in to convince me, it’s really hard for me to stand up for myself or even say no to anyone but I finally got more firm from him stressing me out and told him I wasn’t going to date him.

A few weeks ago I was working, I’ve became really good friends with a guy at work (25m) who I told
About this and we were watching the hockey game while cleaning up, the guy i rejected came in and saw us talking and really weirdly started calling me a liar, said I was flirting with him and clearly not “unavailable”. He’s normally very friendly but it was not friendly at all.

Once when my car was in the shop he offered to give me a ride home, and since that night he’s came to my apartment twice. Once he came with dinner and said I couldn’t turn him down since he already bought it, then a week ago he came and I didn’t answer my door and he texted me saying he knew I was home because my car was outside. My friend (same friend from work) was over that night and opened it after that text and he sent me another one calling me a liar for saying I didn’t want a relationship, then came into the restaurant a few days later and apologized and said he was drinking and had a bad night and “needed me”.

I live in a very very cheap building that anyone can get into, so he can get straight to my door.

I don’t know how to make someone stop, my friend from work even thinks he’s creepy and won’t leave me alone at night anymore, he clocks out and sits in the restaurant for 3+ hours just because he’s worried about this guy.

I dont know if this is the right place to post, I dont use Reddit or socials, I just really don’t know what to do here tbh, he said I’ve always been “flirty” with him but I was really just doing my job and being chatty. We definitely became “close” to an extent but it was because he came in so much! 

He also told me I’m hurting him, because he’s feels like we connected and he never had that with anyone before, I feel kinda bad. I didn’t want to “lead anyone on” but I never saw him in a romantic way, he’s the same age as my dad. And what I said about not dating was never a lie either. 

Im just really stressed about all of it, I don’t have good social skills to begin with. A lot of social anxiety, and have never dated before. I don’t even really have a lot of friends, just my one friend from work. 

And him coming to my apartment also freaks me out a lot, I don’t really think he’d hurt me physically but him feeling comfortable enough to just show up there makes me think he thinks we’re a lot closer than we are.",1,1743387983.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1jnt1cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodService/comments/1jnt1cp/i_quit_my_hostess_job_after_4_shifts/,I quit my hostess job after 4 shifts,"This was about a year ago, for context I hadn’t ever worked in food service before, my only previous work experience was in retail as a cashier and I figured “I can work a register and handle customer service so it should be fine.” And I was also desperate as hell for a new job so when they hired me on the spot at the interview I was like hell yeah.

But from the beginning something felt so off about the job and I’m really not sure if I was just experiencing culture shock from being in a new work environment, or if the restaurant I worked at was just weird. 

First of all, gossip and shit talking was commonplace to an extent I had never seen. It wasnt just “this manager is really strict” it was “this waitress is really weird and annoying and she’s gonna try to befriend you so just smile and nod.” It all felt really immature. Through the gossip I also got the sense that the turnaround rate was pretty high which was another red flag. 

My first couple days were hell, its like despite the fact that it was my first time ever doing this job the waiters and managers got really bitchy when I made even tiny mistakes. If I accidentally double sat somebody or forgot to seat somebodys section, they’d be extremely condescending as if I had been working there for months and should know better. Despite how angry they were over my mistakes, they didn’t bother shadowing me to make sure I didnt fuck up even though it was my first week. They sometimes got annoyed when I asked for help on things. On my second or third day, to “redeem myself” for accidentally double seating her, one of the waitresses asked me to get the drink orders for her 6 top and I panicked because they all ordered coffees and nobody had told me where/how to get the coffee and when I went back and told the waitress this she got even more pissed off at me and made another hostess do it. I understand being annoyed by newbies fucking things up but I always tried to be patient and accommodating to new employees at my retail job cuz I know starting a new job can be scary, idk.

Another weird occurrence was one time my shift was over and I my replacement had already arrived so I went to the manager to let him know I was going to clock out (Since I was new a manager needed to sign off when I clocked out idk how it really worked) and he looked at me with utter confusion and a bit of offense(?) and said “why?” And I thought he was messing with me so I laughed awkwardly and said “Because my shift is over?” And with genuine annoyance he said “Alright whatever” and clocked me out. Did I say something wrong? We were pretty busy that day so like, was he expecting me to work past my shift to help out? 

And Im not sure if this is a normal restaurant thing cuz again Ive only done retail, but when I asked another hostess how breaks work (in the sense of like, do I get a 30 if I work 8 hours) she got really confused and said “like, smoke break? Sure I guess just use the back door and dont take too long” and I was like “no not smoke break, like, just a break?” And she was like “meal break? Oh yeah if u want to buy a meal just let a manager know and they’ll put in the order if we’re slow enough to justify it.” Is it normal to not get breaks in food service unless you buy yourself food during downtime? 

Generally it was just a really hostile/weird environment, I ended every shift on the verge of tears or wanting to slam my head into a wall,  so after my fourth shift I quit.

I need to know if my experience was commonplace in food service and I’m just being overly sensitive, or if that restaurant was just weird? Its totally possible that I was just taking things too personally and I’m not built for that kind of fast paced environment, but I wanted to ask this subreddit because I have no frame of reference except for my retail experience.

Do you still wear that gold buddah necklace? I remember the day you lost it, and how you went crazy trying to find it only for it to show up days later in the most random spot.

Do you still have your crystals? Do you still take them outside to charge them in the full moon?

Do you still go on long car rides with the windows down? Do you still take the long back roads and take your time when you're feeling overwhelmed and just need to feel the wind in your hair?

Because I do.

I think about the way you used to love everyone with your hole heart and soul. You always had a smile on your face, one that was warm and inviting. You always wore your heart on your sleeve, and you made everything better when it felt like I had gone past rock bottom. I could only hope I was just as good to you as you were a life saver to me.

I miss you terribly. As It Was feels like a stab to the heart every time I hear it, but I can never bring myself to take it out of my playlists. It would feel like I'm committing to getting rid of a part of you. Maybe I need to. Not at the moment, though.

I hate knowing you're only an hour away, and I can't just drop by to see you anymore. I hate knowing your number is still on my phone and I can't just send you a funny meme I found because it reminds me of you. I hate that I can't ask about your day. I miss your voice, your laugh, the way that my soul felt immediate comfort just being around you.

It feels like there's a hole in my heart that was perfectly molded to fit you in, and now it's empty.

I hate this. I don't blame you for ending our friendship. I know why it had to happen, and yet I wonder...

Do you still miss me the way I miss you?

1jnt0ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1jnt0ac/high_cholesterol_down_to_perfect_level_after_2/,High cholesterol down to perfect level after 2 months(sorry for long post),"First and foremost, I want to thank my Lord and saviour Jesus Christ for guidance and discernment and for everything in my life. Without him I wouldn't be here and posting this. If you are going through this, or anything else just know there's someone who loves you more than anybody ever will on this earth and has given his life for you. Give him a chance and get to know him, cast your heavy burdens onto Him, the One who created you, and is so merciful and graceful, for even me the worst sinner that even though I have turned away from him and don't deserve none of this, He still gave his life for me. He loves you and is always waiting for you patiently!  

I am 29 have always been active and doing sports and I got a call from my doctor 2 months ago saying I have high cholesterol and I need to get on statins right away( Idk why it felt like he was trying to scare me even though I know he wants the best but nevertheless I gave into some fear and panic after that). I was always tired so all that the doctor told me kind of made sense.  I used to eat relatively well, but have been also indulging in to refined foods and meats, sugary foods and drinks, a lot of bread, a lot of eggs(although I know they are not bad but I used to eat them like crazy), sugary snacks, and just diet being all over the place. 

One day I came face to face with death( I had previously mild experiences like that but not to this scale). It was while I was driving to the hospital I was feeling shortness of breath feeling like I was almost winded, heaviness and pressure in my chest, nauseous, and feeling cold. I felt  so much anxiety and an impending doom about to happen( it has happened mildly while driving before, but it was before the doctor has told me I have high cholesterol). I thought the Lord will take me and I was freaking out I obviously didn't want to go so young and just felt like I haven't done nothing with my life, and I died in the car nobody can come help me so I was a lost cause. I called on the Lord, just wanting all this to go away. Then it came to me ""For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain."" Everything I have is his. He has given me life and everything else like family etc, and it seemed like it might happen, but thank God for his grace and mercy I am still here to tell this. I have never faced death in this way before, it felt like life caught up to me and slapped me in the face, all the non stop hard work and for what? I realized everything we have here is vain, And I have wasted my life away. I called 911 to come and get me even though I was 10 min away from emergency. Then they found me and brought me to the hospital. It all seemed to be okay and when I glimpsed at a tv, it wrote slowly CALM DOWN. So I saw it as a sign from God to just chill out, but not just now but for all my life I have been running like the rat in the hamster wheel and non stop chasing money and something else that does not matter because once we go at the end the its all vain.

Fast forward to later and now, Praise the Lord, I have stopped eating everything bad( I went into a rabbit hole,I read books on cholesterol and all connection to diabetes(my mom has diabetes), books on diet like fiber fueled, grain brain,  the great cholesterol myth, why we get sick, wheat belly, the cholesterol con, deep nutrition, (there’s more) just everything I thought could help me understand why I have high cholesterol at 29 being active and eating relatively good at least 60 percent okay. I also had all kinds of stomach issues but that's a whole other post. I also listened to a lot of Barbara O’Neill. God gave me discernment and understanding of his wisdom, through Barbara and other places( people in my life, books, and life experiences) to learn that truly, truly if we give our bodies the opportunity to heal itself it will, if we give it the right circumstances. God made this absolutely amazing machine that even though we throw garbage at it non stop, it is resilient and can heal. He has given us food and everything from God is good and everything that is altered by humans is (not always) bad and done with bad intentions(money, big pharma, you know the deal).

It goes without saying obviously everyone is different so talk to your doctor about your situation. Also like Barbara always says we should be our own doctors too and listen to what our bodies tell us and last but most importantly the biggest doctor there is - Jesus Christ! Lean on him for the ultimate help.

My symptoms before were: Always tired, never rested, dry eyes, shortness of breath, a lot of mucus, always getting sick, acne all over my face, dry skin, constipation, a bit of fat but not overweight, almost always sore throat. All now gone or almost gone. I feel constant energy even though I drink no coffee. I sleep awesome, lost weight and can see my abs( I go to the gym a lot before and still now but I had a bit of fat still so couldn’t see it). The body is an amazing machine!

What I ate before: chocolates, chips, refined foods, fast food restaurants, overeating(gluttony), too much eggs, hot dogs, meal preps that I make relatively healthy and when I cook was also relatively healthy homemade cooked food, lots of coffee, sweets, late eating. Dairy, wheat and gluten( bread), artificial foods, alcohol

This is what I did ( let me know if you have any questions) to lower my cholesterol from 7.15 to 3.82 and my triglycerides from 1.42 to .37 and other good results in two months without any statins:

**What I eat now and throughout the two months:** every morning I water fast until noon, then I have my last meal before 8 pm. I try to eat without water right after or during meals. I drink wine sometimes but I haven’t drunk for a while now. I only eat whole plant based organic, gluten free, wheat and milk free foods. Absolutely nothing that has chemicals or is refined, no gluten no dairy and no wheat(it has been hybridized), no coffee although the first month I drunk lots of teas to taper off, I drink at least 3 litres of water a day and wake up and drink a bottle of water first thing in the morning. I eat Vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts and seeds. First month I ate some Salmon for omegas 6, but the second month no meat at all as I started a Daniel fast which I plant to stop on this Easter, this fast is in the Bible:

I eat:

* Fruits and vegetables (fresh, frozen, or dried without added sugar)
* Whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats, barley)
* Legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas)
* Nuts and seeds (raw, unsalted)
* Healthy oils (olive, coconut, avocado—in moderation)
* Water is the only beverage allowed

I avoid:

* Meat, poultry, fish, and dairy
* Refined grains and white flour products
* Sugars, sweeteners, and desserts
* Processed foods, artificial additives, and preservatives
* Caffeine, alcohol, and sweetened beverages

Lifestyle changes: I have always done lots of sports so I still go to gym in the morning and play sports when I can, but now I have included just simple going out for a walk in the sun and it has been amazing. Hobbies like soccer, snowboarding, running, biking when I can, and just go see a movie by myself and enjoy life and my singleness by going to places alone.

## Key Features Analysis

the functionality and style of a glass coffee table hinges on several key elements. From the type of glass used, to the frame materials and overall design, understanding these features is essential to making the right choice for your needs.

**Glass Type and Thickness:**

The type and thickness of the glass are crucial for both aesthetics and safety. Tempered glass is the preferred choice due to its superior durability and ability to shatter into small, relatively harmless pieces rather of sharp shards. For coffee tables, a thickness of at least 8mm is recommended for optimal strength and stability. Premium tables often feature 10mm or even 12mm thick glass, providing an even more robust and luxurious feel. Some manufacturers also use laminated glass for added safety and noise reduction.

**Frame Material and Construction:**

The frame of a glass coffee table considerably impacts its overall style and structural integrity. Common frame materials include stainless steel, wood (solid wood or engineered wood), and metal alloys. Stainless steel offers a sleek,contemporary look and is highly resistant to corrosion. Wooden frames can provide a warmer,more traditional aesthetic,but require proper sealing and finishing to prevent moisture damage. Metal alloy frames offer a balance of strength and affordability. The construction method, whether welded, bolted, or glued, also affects the table's stability and longevity.

**Shape and Size:**

The shape and size of the coffee table should be carefully considered in relation to the size and layout of your living room. Common shapes include rectangular,square,round,and oval. Rectangular tables are versatile and work well in longer rooms, while square tables are ideal for smaller, more compact spaces. Round and oval tables promote a more relaxed and social atmosphere, as they allow for easier conversation. The height of the table should also be proportional to the seating arrangement, typically ranging from 16 to 20 inches.

**Weight Capacity and Stability:**

A glass coffee table's weight capacity determines how much weight it can safely support without compromising its structural integrity. It's essential to select a table with a weight capacity that meets your needs, especially if you plan to place heavy objects on it. The stability of the table is equally important, as a wobbly or unstable table can be both annoying and hazardous. Look for tables with adjustable levelers on the feet to compensate for uneven floors and ensure a stable surface.

**Design and Style:**

The design and style of the glass coffee table should complement the overall aesthetic of your living room. Modern designs often feature clean lines, minimalist frames, and obvious glass tops, while more traditional styles may incorporate ornate details, wooden accents, and tinted or frosted glass. Consider the color and finish of the frame, as well as the shape and thickness of the glass, to ensure that the table seamlessly integrates with your existing decor. Contemporary options often incorporate mixed media elements, combining glass with materials like concrete, stone, or even acrylic for a unique and artistic touch.

**Additional Features:**

Some glass coffee tables come with additional features that enhance their functionality and convenience. These may include built-in shelves or drawers for storage, adjustable height mechanisms, or even integrated USB charging ports. Consider whether these features are critically important to you and if they justify the added cost. Shelves can be useful for storing books, magazines, or remote controls, while drawers can provide concealed storage for smaller items. Tables with adjustable height mechanisms can be converted into dining or work surfaces.

## Core Benefits

A well-chosen glass coffee table can offer a multitude of benefits, enhancing the functionality, aesthetics, and overall atmosphere of your living space.

**Enhanced aesthetics:** A glass coffee table instantly elevates the look of any room, adding a touch of modern elegance and sophistication. The clarity of the glass creates a sense of openness and lightness, making the room feel larger and more inviting. By allowing light to pass through, glass coffee tables can also brighten up darker spaces and create a more airy atmosphere.

**Versatile Style Integration:** Glass coffee tables are incredibly versatile and can seamlessly integrate with a wide range of decorating styles, from minimalist and contemporary to traditional and eclectic. The neutral nature of glass allows it to complement existing furniture and decor without clashing or overpowering the space.This makes them a safe and stylish choice for any living room.**Easy Maintenance and Cleaning:** glass surfaces are relatively easy to clean and maintain, requiring only a quick wipe with a damp cloth or glass cleaner to remove dust, smudges, and fingerprints. Unlike wooden or upholstered furniture, glass is resistant to staining and water damage, making it a practical choice for households with children or pets. Tempered glass is also more scratch-resistant than regular glass, ensuring that your coffee table will maintain its pristine appearance for years to come.

**Improved Light Distribution:** The transparent nature of glass allows it to reflect and refract light, enhancing the brightness and ambiance of the room. Glass coffee tables can also help to distribute natural light more evenly throughout the space, reducing shadows and creating a more welcoming atmosphere. This is especially beneficial in rooms with limited natural light.

**Space-Saving Illusion:** Glass coffee tables create the illusion of more space, making them ideal for smaller living rooms or apartments. The transparency of the glass allows you to see through the table, creating a sense of openness and reducing visual clutter. This can make a small room feel larger and more inviting.

## FAQs Section

**Are glass coffee tables safe,especially with children and pets?**
Yes,most modern glass coffee tables are made with tempered glass,which is significantly stronger than regular glass and shatters into small,relatively harmless pieces if broken. Rounded edges and corners are also common features designed to minimize the risk of injury.Though, it's always an excellent idea to supervise children and pets around glass furniture.

**How do I clean and maintain a glass coffee table?**
Cleaning a glass coffee table is simple. use a soft cloth and a glass cleaner to wipe the surface regularly. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch the glass. For stubborn stains, try a mixture of vinegar and water. Always dry the glass thoroughly after cleaning to prevent streaks and water spots.**What is the ideal size and shape of a glass coffee table for my living room?**
The ideal size and shape of a glass coffee table depends on the size and layout of your living room, as well as the size of your seating area. A general rule of thumb is that the coffee table should be about two-thirds the length of your sofa and approximately the same height as the seat cushions. The shape of the table should also complement the shape of the room.Such as, a rectangular table works well in a long, narrow room, while a round or oval table is better suited for a smaller, more square room.

**How much weight can a glass coffee table typically hold?**
The weight capacity of a glass coffee table varies depending on the thickness of the glass and the strength of the frame. Most tempered glass coffee tables can safely hold between 50 and 100 pounds. Though, it's always best to check the manufacturer's specifications before placing heavy objects on the table.

1jnsu69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1jnsu69/out_of_options/,Out of options,"41(F) separated under the same roof with 34(M) for a year. He initiated the split a year after we had our first child and five years of marriage. He lacked career ambition, didn’t contribute to chores, mishandled savings, and constantly complained about sex. I was the primary breadwinner, blindly supporting him until I went on maternity leave, suffered postpartum depression, and my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.

The issues escalated when I stopped financially supporting him, asked him to help with chores, and requested he shorten his four-hour weekend video calls with his family (who live in another country). After an argument, he declared he’d never be my husband again due to “disrespect.”

We live in a co-op unit I spent years applying for. He refuses to move out, claiming his name is on the lease and that he contributes by buying groceries and paying for the internet—though in reality, he covers groceries only every other weekend and claims his credit card is maxed out. He does no cleaning, even in shared spaces like the kitchen and bathroom.

Our child bed-shares with me, and even when I’m sick, he refuses to help and leaves for work. He does, however, do bath time daily and spend time with our child on weekends. But weekends are exhausting—he monopolizes the kitchen and living room, keeps up his long family calls, and indirectly taunts me while on the phone. The age gap between us is made an issue and I am constantly berated for being older than him. I can’t even make myself a cup of coffee until he’s done.

I contacted the co-op, but unless he chooses to leave, we’d both have to vacate. I have savings, but I don’t want to drain them on an expensive lawyer—I need to think about my child’s future. I know he won’t leave or file for divorce because this setup benefits him financially.

I feel completely stuck and exhausted.
