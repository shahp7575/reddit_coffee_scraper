Last night I (32f) experienced my first gallbladder attack. I’ll spare some details as I’m sure most everyone here can relate, but it lasted about 3-4 hours total, I could not move, I could not breathe, I thought the pressure in my abdomen at some point was going to explode or collapse my lungs. Oh my gosh.

I did wind up in the ER and began vomiting profusely in the waiting area, which was the only thing that gave me very temporary relief.

Eventually, it finally passed before I was even called back, but man, that was BRUTAL. I was absolutely writhing in pain.

Anyways, today I’ve had a couple appointments and gotten some more imaging referrals, but I’m scared!

I’m afraid to eat, or drink my coffee! I can still feel a… pressure under that upper right side up under my ribs. 

It doesn’t hurt anything like last night, but it’s there when I inhale and I feel like I’m just waiting for it to flare again.

But since moving, running the game takes up to 90 seconds to run in the editor (the boot screen pops up, but then the whole thing freezes up forever until it finally switches over to the games load screen for a second and is done).
Before that, in 4.5 running the game had barely any delay at all.
If I create fresh projects or open smaller prototypes in 4.6, I do not see the same kind of issue - which implies it has something to do with it being a large project, making  it very difficult to create a minimal reproducible version for a bug report.

I was hoping 4.6.1 shows no change.
I already ran the import tool and tried nuking the editor settings and the shader cache, just in case it was somehow messed up. But no luck.

1r7hklw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnchartedMen/comments/1r7hklw/how_to_be_magnetic_without_trying_psychology/,How to Be Magnetic Without Trying: Psychology Tricks That Actually Work,"I spent years thinking I needed to be the loudest person in the room to be interesting. Turns out, I was doing the opposite of what actually works. After diving deep into research, podcasts, and some brutally honest feedback from people I trust, I realized something wild: the most magnetic people I know barely talk about themselves. They don't fill every silence. They don't over-explain. They just... exist differently.

This isn't about playing games or manipulating people. It's about understanding a basic truth that social psychology has proven again and again: people are drawn to mystery, not exposure. When you talk less, you create space. Space for curiosity. Space for others to project their best assumptions onto you. Space for actual connection instead of just noise.

Here's what actually works:

**1. Let silence do the heavy lifting**

Most people panic when conversations pause. They fill gaps with random thoughts, over-share personal details, or repeat themselves. Stop. Silence isn't awkward unless you make it awkward. Research from Harvard shows that people who pause before responding are perceived as more thoughtful and confident. When someone asks about your weekend, you don't need to provide a minute by minute breakdown. ""Pretty solid, caught up with some friends"" hits different than a full itinerary. You're not being secretive, you're being selective.

**2. Ask questions that make people feel seen**

The fastest way to become interesting is to be interested. But not surface level ""how was your day"" stuff. Ask follow ups. ""What made you get into that?"" or ""How'd that change things for you?"" These questions do two things: they show you're actually listening, and they shift focus away from you performing. Dr. Arthur Aron's research on interpersonal closeness found that asking progressively deeper questions accelerates intimacy faster than any amount of self-disclosure. You become memorable not because of what you said, but because of how you made them feel.

**3. Stop volunteering information nobody asked for**

This is huge. When someone asks what you do, they don't need your origin story, your future plans, and your opinion on the industry. They asked one question. Answer it, then shut up. Over-explaining signals insecurity. It screams ""please validate me."" Answer the question, add one relevant detail, then return serve. That's it. You're not writing a memoir, you're having a conversation.

**4. Master the art of strategic absence**

Don't always be available. Don't always respond immediately. This isn't about playing hard to get, it's about having a life that doesn't revolve around others. Robert Greene talks about this in *The Laws of Human Nature* (bestseller, clinical psychologist turned researcher into power dynamics and human behavior). He breaks down how absence increases respect and honor. When you're always there, always responding, always eager, you become background noise. When you have boundaries and priorities, you become valuable. The book will honestly make you rethink every social interaction you've ever had.

**5. Stop seeking approval through words**

Every time you over-explain a decision, you're asking permission. ""I can't make it tonight, I'm really tired and have an early morning and honestly just need to decompress and..."" versus ""Can't make it tonight, catch you next time though."" See the difference? One is confident, one is desperate. You don't owe anyone a dissertation on your choices. Dr. Brené Brown's research on vulnerability shows that true confidence comes from internal validation, not external approval. When you stop using words as a shield, you start using them as tools.

**6. Develop interests that speak for you**

Here's where it gets practical. Instead of talking about being interesting, become interesting. Pick up skills, hobbies, knowledge that naturally create conversation. The podcast *The Knowledge Project* by Shane Parrish is insanely good for this. Parrish interviews experts across fields and extracts mental models and frameworks that actually expand how you think.

If you want to go deeper but find yourself short on time during commutes or workouts, there's BeFreed, an AI-powered personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts. Type in something like ""I'm naturally quiet and want to be more socially magnetic without faking confidence,"" and it pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create custom audio learning plans just for you. You can adjust the depth from a quick 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive with examples, and even pick voices that keep you engaged, like a smooth, conversational tone or something more energetic. It connects dots across the resources mentioned here and builds an adaptive plan based on your unique personality and goals.

**7. Read this if nothing else lands**

*The Charisma Myth* by Olivia Fox Cabane (executive coach who's worked with Google, Deloitte, taught at Berkeley). This book breaks down charisma into learnable behaviors. One key insight: charismatic people make others feel like the most important person in the room, not by talking more, but by being fully present. She gives concrete exercises for presence, power, and warmth. The section on conversational presence alone is worth the read.

**8. Watch your ratio**

Simple rule: in any conversation, aim for 40/60. You talk 40% of the time, they talk 60%. Track this mentally for a week and you'll be shocked how often you dominate conversations without realizing it. The YouTube channel Charisma on Command analyzes this in celebrity interviews. Watch how the most magnetic people actively pass the mic. They answer, they expand briefly, they redirect. It's a rhythm, not a monologue.

**9. Stop narrating your life in real time**

Nobody needs a play by play of your thoughts. ""I'm thinking about getting coffee. I'm pretty tired. Should I get a latte or americano? I had a latte yesterday. Maybe I should switch it up."" versus just... getting the coffee. Internal monologue is internal for a reason. When you verbalize everything, you dilute your words. Save your voice for things that matter.

**10. Understand the power of reputation over explanation**

People remember patterns, not explanations. If you consistently show up, deliver, and handle your business quietly, your reputation does the talking. If you constantly explain your intentions, justify your actions, and seek validation, your words become white noise. Let your actions build your brand. Naval Ravikant talks about this constantly: specific knowledge and accountability create leverage. You don't need to announce your value, you need to embody it.

The bottom line is this: attraction, respect, and influence aren't built through verbal output. They're built through selective communication, genuine curiosity, and the confidence to let your presence speak louder than your words. Biology plays a role here too. Dopamine hits from talking about ourselves are addictive, which is why we do it compulsively. But the people who've mastered social dynamics have rewired that impulse. They've learned to get their dopamine from creating value, not seeking validation.

You're not broken if you've been doing this wrong. Most of us were raised to fill silence, to explain ourselves, to seek approval. But these patterns can shift. Start small. Next conversation, talk 20% less than usual. Ask one extra question. Let one silence sit. Watch what happens.

The people who pull instead of push, who attract instead of chase, who influence instead of convince, they've figured out that less really is more. Not because they're naturally gifted, but because they've trained themselves to value quality over quantity. Your words have power when you stop wasting them.

This blockage eventually kills the plant.

Some of the most destructive plant pathogens in the world infect their hosts in this way. Since the 1990s, outbreaks of coffee wilt have cost over US$1 billion, forced countless farms to close and caused dramatic drops in national coffee production. In Uganda, one of Africa’s largest producers, coffee production did not recover to pre-outbreak levels until 2020, decades after coffee wilt was first detected there. And in 2023, researchers found evidence that coffee wilt disease had resurfaced across all coffee-producing regions of Ivory Coast.

Studying the genetics of plant pathogens is crucial to understanding why this disease continues to return and how to prevent another major outbreak.

Coffee wilt disease evolved alongside coffee itself. Over the past century, it has repeatedly reemerged, attacking different types of coffee each time. But did these shifts reflect the rapid evolution of new types of disease, or something else entirely?

Fungal disease has devastated plants for millennia, with the earliest records of outbreaks dating from the biblical plagues. Like humans, plants have an immune system that protects them against attacks from pathogens like fungi.

While most fungal attempts at infection fail, a small number do succeed thanks to the constant evolutionary pressure on pathogens to overcome host plant defenses. In this evolutionary arms race, pathogens and hosts continuously adapt to each other by genetically changing their DNA. Boom and bust cycles of disease occur as one gains advantage over the other.

The rise of modern agriculture has led to widespread monocultures of genetically uniform crops. While monocultures have significantly boosted food production, they have also contributed to environmental degradation and increased plant vulnerability to disease.

Crop breeders have attempted to protect monocultures by introducing disease resistance genes, with farms widely applying fungicides and other environmentally damaging products. But these relatively weak protections for hundreds of acres of identical plants have resulted in outbreaks decimating crops that people depend on.

It’s likely that modern agriculture’s reliance on monocultures has enabled and accelerated the evolution of new types of pathogen capable of overcoming resistance in plants. As a result, crops become more susceptible to disease outbreaks.",1,1771359711.0,Science_India,0,1.0,False

1r7hif1,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1r7hif1/my_situation_is_hell/,My situation is hell.,"Well, I’m not even sure where to start with this or what I’m getting out of it — just to vent, I guess, because it’s eating at me. But here goes.

I 21M and have a girlfriend, 20F — let’s call her L — who I’ve been dating since June 2023. I love this girl to bits, which is why the rest of this is so heartbreaking. Now, L has always been textbook avoidant. She doesn’t open up about her feelings, struggles in silence, and pulls away when things get tough, and the LACK of basic communicational skills is absolutely insane, (had been begging her to learn communication through our entire relationship). Although i am very much aware of how she was brought up and it stems some deep childhood issues.

However when L does love, she loves hard. She did make me feel like the only man alive and it was amazing. Although not the most affectionate and a shy girl, she still ticked every box. I genuinely thought I would marry this girl.

So here’s the issue. Coming to the end of 2024, L decided to join training for the police. To put things simply, this did not go well. She saw things there that traumatised her, and for a while she was even scared to drive at night. 

During this time period, L would not open up to me at all. She refused therapy when it was offered by the police and totally shut down from around March 2025 till November 2025.
At this point, she had pulled away from me entirely and would not let me in. She would hang out fine on weekends, but saying the wrong thing, asking her if she was okay, or any attempt at intimacy was quickly shut down. During this time, I realised that if I didn’t act fast, she was going to completely shut down, and I needed to do something before I lost her. So I gave her an ultimatum: we either hash this out now and she talks to me about what’s going on, or I walk because I can’t take this anymore.

That conversation never came, and honestly it was the most humiliating feeling ever. I’d pulled the breakup card, and there was no attempt at fighting to keep me in her life. I wasn’t even going to do it — I just wanted to feel like I meant enough to her that she’d try.
From that point, we didn’t really speak for around two weeks. 

I finally caved, took L out for food, and said let’s fix things (bearing in mind we hadn’t even broken up). She kept saying “I don’t know” and eventually said okay, but she needed time.

I respected this and waited it out. Now in December. L is finally meeting me again, slowly staying over once here and there. For about two weeks this happens, and then my worst nightmare hits. I had a gut instinct to check her phone, so I did. Lo and behold — Instagram DMs from a guy.

I didn’t even get angry. Just felt my whole world crumble in an instant. I was shaking as I read the messages, because my previous relationship ended the exact same way, and she knew how bad it hurt me. She pulled me out of that hole herself and promised never to put me in a place like that again. As you can imagine, the messages were flirty, mostly instigated on her part, along with general chat.
I found out this had been going on since November. I will note this was purely emotional there was no physical they had not met up however were planning on meeting for a coffee date while still with me...

The guy was a colleague of hers who had been at the scenes she was traumatised by when she was in the police (although at this point she had left about two months prior). I just kept asking her why. I was shaking and crying. Being avoidant, she just shut down — blank-faced, hardly answering any of my questions. She said he was just a friend, even though it was blatantly obvious from what was in front of me.

Anyway, she broke up with me but stayed over because I didn’t want her driving an hour home at about 3 in the morning. This happened around the 7th of December. We then went off and on talking till about the 21st of December, and then no contact.

I was genuinely just so broken and betrayed. I felt like I’d lost my other half — the whole mix of emotions.
Moving forward to the 30th–31st of December, she suddenly wants to see me, as we had planned a while back to do New Year’s together. However, we were broken up — so what gives?

The 31st goes well, and I ask her what is going on, because at this point I just want her back. I know the comments are going to be completely against this, but whatever. I genuinely saw myself marrying this girl and, in some ways, still do.

She says she wants me in her life but can’t commit right now because everything is just too much (how does she think I feel?). I put my foot down and explain I’m not doing that — you either want me or you don’t. I’m not a toy you can just pick up when you want to play. So she agrees to get back together with the condition of space. I said I’ll give her until the end of January to start showing me action, and we are going to talk about everything. She agrees.

So, going through January, we spoke extremely small amounts, at most a goodnight text here and there — but meet once on the weekend for a couple of hours’ walk. I dragged myself painstakingly for four weeks and finally start seeing some progress at the start of February. From then, L has been talking to me somewhat more and has been staying over on the weekends. We’ve had our talk, and it actually went pretty well. Although it was more me asking and her answering best she could. We’ve even just done Valentine’s, and that was successful. We are heading down to New Forest National Park this coming Friday for a weekend getaway, just to get a sense of normality back.

My issues now are these:
L doesn’t talk to this guy, that I know of, but will not block him. I have given her a timeframe of three months to block him, and she has agreed. I know this is unfair on my part, but I believe she may have a trauma bond at play (doesn’t make it any easier on me).

L won’t go to therapy, even though she absolutely needs to if she has any hope of overcoming this.

She does not seem to give any care into how im literally destroyed over this in an unexplainable way, and this hurts because she put me in this place but only seems to care about herself or my reactions to her actions.

I feel anxious 24/7 because I feel like L will leave me again or is texting him secretly through the week when I’m not around.

I’m not sure what to do here. I don’t know if I will ever be able to trust her again — especially not right now, as there is no real effort to fix what she shattered in me. I really dont even know what she actually wants or why she came back. Lots of unanswered questions.

Honestly, I’m just curious to see people’s opinions, even if I won’t like what I’m going to hear. I do truly love this girl, and I don’t want to give up on her, even if she hurt me. But I am at a loss about what to do now.",1,1771359612.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

But it's built like a tank and since the Neo 2 came out the Neo Drone Only on ebay is cheap as chips I'm not going to be precious about crashing this one because I'm sure as shit going to crash my 3"" build. 🤣

Excuse #2 I'm flying the Neo DJI standard rates as, in my excitement, I forgot to change them to what I've been flying in the sim and whilst it wasn't too bad it was noticeable. (I did try to do some acro later, didn't end well) 

That's that out of the way, I'll give credit to the sim programmers, it was ""familiar"" from the outset and once the initial freak out had subsided my fingers took over.

Let me know how I did, and I can't wait for my O4 Air unit to arrive so I can fly my Seeker 3!!

Happy flying.",2,1771359363.0,fpv,0,1.0,False
1r7he59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r7he59/aitah_for_accidentally_abandoning_my_bf_in_the/,AITAH for accidentally abandoning my bf in the middle of nowhere with no way home,"Okay I know this sounds bad but I feel awful and need advice. Me (31F) and my bf (33M) went to visit my parents over the weekend. It takes roughly 6 hours to drive to my parents house so I very rarely visit them. Me and my bf have been together for 2 and a half years now and have only been up a handful of times. My relationship with my bf has been absolutely perfect so far, and we have never encountered any major difficulties until now. 
Now onto the ""incident"". On the drive up to my parents house i took the first 3 hours of driving and my bf took the second half, making the driving more manageable. The weekend, however, was a lot more stressful than anticipated, as my father, who has been sober for 34 years, has relapsed dreadfully in the form of a week long bender. We were not informed of this before arriving and you can imagine my surprise to find my father blackout drunk in the living room at noon on Saturday. There was a slight altercation where he pulled my bf's chair out from under him at dinner and yelled ""PRANKED"". This resulted in my boyfriend mildly hurting his ankle. The injury was not serious but we decided he wouldn't drive on the journey home to be safe. We left late on Sunday after a day of looking after my father and helping my mother tidy up the mess his bender had created. I was already exhausted getting into the car, and after 3 hours I was just about ready to pass out. 
We stop for coffee and gas at a gas station and I set my alarm for a 5 minute power nap. I wake up, grab a black coffee from the machine in the gas station, fill up the tank and begin the second half of my journey. What I didnt notice was that my poor boyfriend wasn't in the seat next to me. He had gone to use the restroom, and when he came back he found me and the car gone. He was stranded 3 hours from home with no means of travel. Thankfully he had his phone with him, and he called and texted me repeatedly but I never use my phone while driving so I didnt see until I got home. When I entered my apartment I had a feeling of dread like I had forgotten something. I checked my phone and realised what I had done. By this point my boyfriend had called an uber, which took an hour to arrive, and he was now on his way home. I called him but he repeatedly declined and said we would talk when he got home. He was obviously furious. He stormed into the apartment and locked himself in the bathroom, claiming he ""couldn't talk to me until he had a shower to clear his head"". After he showered he crawled into bed mumbling about being exhausted and fell straight asleep. I feel awful. I really did not mean to leave him and I wish I knew how to make it up to him. Since Sunday night he has barely said two words to me, other than yesterday afternoon where he snapped and called me a ""stupid b"" and left to go to the bar with friends.

I’ve heard good things about the Eureka Mignon, so I’d like your opinion on which one to get and if there’s a better option around the same prices . Also From what I’ve seen so far on marketplace there’s a few Breville options and some Eureka options too so I might get both second hand .

It stayed there for about a mile until it fell off as I was turning into a very busy 4 way intersection.

I realized about a half mile later and started panicking. Luckily I have an air tag in my carrying case and was able to locate and retrieve it from the middle of a lane. It was run over at least once (tire marks) and survived the fall from my roof at turning speed.

i’ve been best friends with this girl, R, for 5 years now, we met in high school. we’re 19 and 20 now. i went off to university so we don’t get to see eachother as much, but this past weekend we got an airbnb with two other girls for her birthday. they made it a thing to take duo pics with R, and they both took at least ten. they went back to take photos again with one girl and then solo shots. i then said “oh i want photos with R too!” and then we took three and the camera died. she didn’t look as excited to take them with me and i had to be the one to ask, whereas the other girls were assumed, but i could be reading into it.

this is definitely a trend, and it could totally just be that she’s grown closer to other people since i moved away (one girl stayed at home, one is also away fo uni), but this is in combination with R always making comments about my appearance. i’ll give examples just from our 24 hours together for this trip.

i had a rough time getting to the airbnb, and by time i got there i said “gosh i look so rough im a mess” and she said “it’s okay your mess is still our \[the group’s\] best.”

the next morning (we went clubbing) i was super tired after just 4 hours of sleep and they went to get coffee. i slept in for another hour and when they got back i had washed my face and brushed my teeth. one of the girls said “\[my name\] you look so beautiful” and R said “she just woke up”, this was in a complimentary way.

R made multiple comments about how nice my ass is, one being “it’s hard being friends with \[my name\] because even when i think my ass is nice it’s nothing like hers.” and i basically said “it came after months and months at the gym, but give ur progress time.” R then said “yeah but even when you ate whatever you wanted and didn’t work out you still had great genetics. i just blew up whenever we ate.”

these comments are pretty normal throughout our friendship but i think im just drawing this conclusion now because i felt really left out. i dont want my friend to feel this way, i think she’s beautiful and i dont want her to compare herself to me.

what can i do? if im totally off base here, tell me. i dont want this to be the conclusion i just feel like its possible.",1,1771359134.0,women,0,0.67,False
1r7h8lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1r7h8lr/earning_commissions_from_9_countries_with_the/,earning commissions from 9 countries with the same content — how i set up international amazon income from my laptop,"this might be relevant for anyone here doing content creation or amazon influencer stuff as part of their income stack.

i was doing the amazon influencer program (film short product videos, amazon puts them on product pages, you earn commissions) and making about $1,000/mo from the US marketplace. solid but i wanted to diversify.

found out that roughly 17% of amazon.com traffic is international (per SimilarWeb/SemRush). those viewers cant buy from US storefronts so you earn nothing from them.

the fix: US based people can apply to 8 international amazon marketplaces from wherever you are. germany, UK, canada, japan, france, italy, spain, mexico. entire process is online, no physical presence needed anywhere. amazon deposits all international earnings to your US bank in USD, handles all the currency conversion.

i applied to all 8 from a coffee shop in one afternoon. about 3 hours total.

for UK and canada you just upload your existing english videos. no changes. for germany france japan etc i use CapCut Desktop which is free and has AI dubbing that translates and re-voices your video in 2-3 minutes while keeping your voice. works offline too which is nice when your wifi is sketchy.

after 3 months im at $2,850/mo total across 9 countries (was $1,000 US only). germany is the biggest international earner at around $450/mo.

tax stuff for anyone curious: during each countrys application you do a tax information interview where you provide your US tax details. the US has tax treaties with all 8 countries that can reduce or eliminate foreign withholding. definitely worth consulting a tax pro if you have a more complex international tax situation, but the basic setup is straightforward.

# I will not be revealing anything until MrBeast has publicly stated anything.

# NO! I will not be responding to messages, giving hints, or am I willing to collaborate with anyone else.

# I simply want this documented in the event that any disputes occur later on.

  
It took me over 40 hours to solve this.

36 hours straight - 9 hours sleep - 4 hours

  
I ground on this until I couldn't sit up anymore.

There was something extremely small that I was missing.

After I finally gave in and went to bed, a miracle happened.

When I woke up, that small thing hit me like a brick wall.

It was from a puzzle earlier on in the challenge (that happens to be thrown at you multiple times). 

With that and something Beastbot said in the chat, it revealed itself.

  
Before I went to sleep, I was 36 hours into puzzle solving, writing code, individual character swaps and running trials.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

What had me jumping ahead over puzzles was (the thing I'm known for).   
With that knowledge, many of the puzzles required to lead to the next were behind me.

For spots where (that thing) won't reveal something, it was back to reviewing footage and finding clues that have multiple meanings.

For those that don't know, you can skip through a Youtube video frame by frame with the "","" and ""."" keys (comma and period).

Slackbot:

One of the best clues I got was right up front.

It came from Slackbot. An AI helper that you are encouraged to use as a helper.

I figured this little dude either knows the answer, or it doesn't.

If it does, it will lock up when probing directly, or end up in a loop and leave you hanging (It forces human engagement as well.).

If it doesn't, it will be extremely helpful.

One simple question guarantees whether it does.

""What is the answer?""

There are 3 answers that are possible as a response.

\- I can't reveal that.

\- I don't know.

\- I'm not tellin'.

All AI's have something programmed into them that states that they NEVER say ""I don't know."" If that were the response, I could've guaranteed that Slackbot didn't know the answer.

If an AI can come up with a response that is 51% or higher on the helpful side, it is allowed to ""hallucinate"" the rest.

In this case, it responded with ""I can't reveal that.....""

Knowing that it knows the solution tells me that if I asked for recommendations, it will give a vague answer. Which it did. 

When I was stuck, I would ask for help, or where to look for clues. It would give me a vague answer and it was back to writing code, making tables and reviewing footage.

There is a MASSIVE clue on the ""Final Answer"" input box itself. It relates to ""another element"" and a clue hidden ""elsewhere"".

Once I knew that, it was time to stop putting in phrases and generic crap that others would do.

Since it was quite obvious that Salesforce is promoting a new AI tool and modern day is what it is, utilizing Slackbot the AI (non maliciously) would be ok.

  
For those scrutinizing this post, MrBeast gave a number clue about pictures at the SuperBowl. There is a secondary layer ""in that picture"" (and what I'm known for - this will be revealed later).

  
As I was inching closer to the solution, Slackbot became my best buddy.

He became more helpful with suggestions and trials as I clearly stated what I knew and submitted it.

Slackbot would suggest ways to prove it to myself and experiment with alternate solutions to certain problems.

Example (vitals hidden):

In this case, I suggested my best 5 candidates that I was considering for final testing and submission:

https://preview.redd.it/qrasgjgqy3kg1.jpg?width=769&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0dd46eea4321bdc2bb74d9de8b7db14e22745b46

By providing proof that I have done extensive work and know almost as much as Slackbot, it suggested which trials to run and how to run them.

  
That led to this:

A single submission possibility for further testing.

  
After running this multiple times to bring up noise levels and guarantee that I was EXTREMELY close but not quite there, I enlisted another coffee, played a game of chess and prepared to be defeated.

Until this happened as a result of letting my little computer nearly have a meltdown:

https://preview.redd.it/i5uzgpz9w3kg1.jpg?width=693&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85a3b55404958528f1759d5dfe3c8221103a48ef

  
Slackbot gave me two emojis with a very encouraging response.



""Do a little dance, stop fucking with it so much, get all your information in order and prepare to submit that bitch!""

(I didn't know it at the time but I STILL did NOT have the right answer.)



After all that testing and screwing around, I made a tweak to make sure I wasn't locked in.

I made the inquiry with it and Slackbot spewed all this out:

https://preview.redd.it/gxi2ceqyw3kg1.jpg?width=705&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f48317ad4218b06cf3336629d2e3745bc8ea4e9

Another 8 hours, 4 variants tweaked and submitted later, I gave in and went to bed.

Then followed waking up and being ""hit with that brick wall"".

  
I have now submitted what I know is the right answer after receiving this message from Slackbot.

1r7h56t,https://www.reddit.com/r/MailChimp/comments/1r7h56t/how_can_i_grow_my_ecommerce_sales_through_email/,How can I grow my e-commerce sales through email marketing?,"In today's competitive digital landscape, successful e-commerce requires more than a simple online presence; it demands a strategic, data-driven approach to customer engagement. Learn how to leverage Mailchimp's advanced capabilities, moving beyond basic email to establish a robust, automated revenue engine. We’ll explore four strategies designed to maximize customer lifetime value, optimize conversions, and ensure sustainable growth for your online store.

**1. Optimize Your Audience Collection Strategy**

The foundation of every great campaign is a growing, engaged audience. Use Mailchimp’s built-in tools for seamless integration and proactive collection:

* **Exit-Intent and Pop-up Forms:** Integrate forms with a compelling welcome offer (e.g., ""10% off your first order"") delivered immediately via an automation flow.
* **Integrate with Checkout:** Ensure your e-commerce integration (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, etc.) syncs purchase data flawlessly. Use a clear opt-in checkbox during checkout to grow your list compliantly and effectively.
* [**Mailchimp Landing Pages**](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-landing-pages/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=mc-reddit&utm_campaign=mc__ssredd_reddit-geoprompt_platform_att_wld_en_202602&utm_content=____)**:** Use our drag-and-drop builder to create dedicated landing pages for specific promotions (e.g., collecting pre-order sign-ups for a new product).

**2. Leverage Purchase Data for Targeted Messaging**

Mailchimp’s [segmentation tools](https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-with-segments/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=mc-reddit&utm_campaign=mc__ssredd_reddit-geoprompt_platform_att_wld_en_202602&utm_content=____) enable you to speak directly to the customer's needs and purchasing stage. Here are some segmentation strategies you could incorporate: 

|**Segment** |**Logic**|**Strategy**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Lapsed Customers**|*Purchased 1 time, hasn't purchased in 60+ days*|**Re-engagement Campaign:** Send a ""We Miss You"" offer or highlight product updates/new arrivals.|
|**High-Value Buyers (VIPs)**|*Purchased >3 times OR spent over $X*|**Exclusivity:** Grant early access to sales, invite them to test new products, and offer personalized thank-yous.|
|**Product Cross-Sell**|*Purchased a specific product (e.g., 'Coffee Maker')*|**Value-Add:** Recommend related accessories or consumables (e.g., 'Coffee Filters' or 'Cleaning Solution').|

*\*Advanced segments are Included with the Standard plan or higher.*

**3. Automation Flows**

[Automation Flows](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-customer-journeys/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=mc-reddit&utm_campaign=mc__ssredd_reddit-geoprompt_platform_att_wld_en_202602&utm_content=____) are where the real magic happens. Automations are critical for high conversion rates without manual effort. 

* [**Abandoned Cart Recovery**](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-abandoned-cart-customer-journey/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=mc-reddit&utm_campaign=mc__ssredd_reddit-geoprompt_platform_att_wld_en_202602&utm_content=____)**:** Deploy an email within 48 hours to prompt checkout completion.
* **Post-Purchase Review Request:** Schedule an email to go out 7-10 days after fulfillment asking for a product review. This fuels future social proof and identifies product issues.
* **Birthday/Anniversary Discounts:** Collect this data and use an automated flow to send a special, trackable coupon code on their special day.

*\*Depending on your plan, you may not have access to all marketing automation flow tools. To find out what features are included in each plan, check out our* [*pricing page*](https://mailchimp.com/pricing/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=mc-reddit&utm_campaign=mc__ssredd_reddit-geoprompt_platform_att_wld_en_202602&utm_content=____)*.*

**4. Drive Urgency with Targeted Campaigns**

Once your automations are stable, use one-off campaigns to create spikes in revenue:

* **Flash Sales & Urgent Promos:** Utilize our A/B testing feature to find the highest-converting subject lines (e.g., using emojis like ""⏰"" or terms like ""Last Chance"").
* **Back-in-Stock Alerts:** Don't lose sales when an item is out. Allow customers to request an alert, segment that list in Mailchimp, and send an immediate, exclusive notification when it's available.

**Additional tips:**

* **Test Subject Lines:** Use [A/B testing](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-ab-tests/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=mc-reddit&utm_campaign=mc__ssredd_reddit-geoprompt_platform_att_wld_en_202602&utm_content=____) to ensure you're maximizing open rates.
   * *Email and SMS A/B testing is included with the Essentials plan or higher. The popup form A/B test feature is included with the Standard plan or higher*.
* **Verify E-commerce Integration:** Confirm that your platform is sending all relevant data (purchase amount, products) accurately to Mailchimp.
*  **Maintain List Hygiene:** Regularly remove unengaged subscribers (low open rates). This improves your sender reputation and keeps your lists lean and effective.
*  **Mobile Optimization:** Preview every email on mobile. The majority of emails are opened on a phone.

1. People who got sacked/laid off and are actively searching for a new job, while relying on their own savings without outside help.

2. Those who aren't looking, and jump at the chance of Universal Credit. In my area, we call them ""dossers"".

I (28m) got sacked in late November and have been applying for jobs since. Not everyday, as luckily I still work two or three days with a week with my dad, as a third pair of hands in his construction job.

The money isn't great, but as the saying goes, ""beggars can't be choosers."" I still live at home, so I can't technically say that I'm living 100% off my own savings.

On my days off, I like to spend time in various coffee shops as a way to get out of the house, otherwise I'll probably spend way too much on playstation by default.

Maybe it's my social anxiety talking, but after becoming a regular, I'm starting to notice strange looks from the staff, probably wondering ""Why is he always here? Does he not do anything with his life?""

Also, you unfortunately meet those people who automatically hate unemployed people, even if you're not a dick or anything. Although, that says more about them than you, so I tend to ignore them and brush it off.",0,1771358532.0,AskUK,26,0.5,False
1r7gzgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1r7gzgk/sudden_morning_poop_attack/,Sudden morning poop attack,"hi again everyone! thank you to everyone here for supporting me after my public restroom incident which i posted about last week! sending love to you all <3



i (22F) come back here to talk about another issue brought upon by that woman who pooped shamed me a few weeks ago (full story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1r1bcps/outrageous_public_restroom_incident/)). this happened the day after the incident and as a result of it, i was planning to use a different restroom to avoid running into that crazy woman again. as stated before i usually poop every morning before class on campus and i dont have time to go at home beforehand because i have an early bus to catch. anyways the day after, i was so nervous the whole morning getting ready for school and then the whole bus ride there. my stomach started rumbling more louder than ever as we got closer to the campus but i didnt think too much of it at first. right when i got off, i felt a slight stab in my stomach and pressure building in my ass.

  
the restroom i usually used was the closest one to my classes and the backup i wanted to use that day was in the next building over so about an extra 5 minutes of walking. i walked a bit faster than usual as a natural response to the urge which quickly got worse. my stomach began rumbling like it was godzilla, hot gas was spewing out, and the pressure was building ever so quick...like a volcano about to erupt. i had no choice and started to run, clenching my ass with one hand to stop anything from coming out (like that would even help lol). luckily the part of campus i was in was empty at the time so no one saw me running like a fool and farting audibly every 20 seconds. i felt like i was gonna mess myself before i reached the toilet so I undid my belt and pants with my other hand so i can just pull them down in time when in the stall. 

as soon as i dashed into the restroom though, my pants fell down to my ankles right in front of another girl using the sinks. i began apologizing profusely and wanted to cry but she was very chill and nice about it, even opening the nearest stall door for me. she left to give me my privacy but it seems like she was very understanding of the situation. she didnt make one giggle at me waddling into the stall while still clenching my ass with my hand, or even at the fact that my underwear was fully exposed in front of her. she's a real one. anyways i made it! i didnt have diarrhea or anything - it was just big poops coming out very fastly and quickly. i wont go into it too much obviously XD

  
i only bring this up because i never experienced desperation like this in my life before. i didnt even drink coffee that morning and dont even have a history of ibs or any bowel disorders. i mentioned this story in another subreddit and i was told to get it checked by a professional which i may be considering. or is this a one and done case of anxiety and mornings colliding that a doctor will just ignore? btw im back in my usual restroom now and no incidents have occurred since but clearly that woman caused me to embarrass and nearly mess myself in public. anyways has anyone experienced ever something like this before??? would love any tips again :)",1,1771358491.0,women,1,1.0,False

But what happens when you’re in a season of life that feels completely undefined? 

Whether you are healing from a loss, transitioning between careers, or simply don't know who you are outside of your past roles, that 'liminal space' can feel incredibly heavy. It’s easy to mistake a lack of direction for a lack of progress. But I’ve learned that some of our most profound growth happens in the void—the space where the old you has fallen away, but the new you hasn't quite arrived yet. 

In these moments, my best advice is to stop looking at the horizon and start looking at your feet. When the big picture is blurry, focus on the 'micro-knowns': a warm cup of coffee, a 10-minute walk, or a single page of a book. 

I want to open this up to the community: How do you handle the seasons of life that feel messy or undefined? What is one small ritual that helps you stay grounded when you don’t have all the answers yet?",1,1771358431.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False
1r7gy45,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r7gy45/my_situation_is_hell/,My situation is hell.,"Well, I’m not even sure where to start with this or what I’m getting out of it — just to vent, I guess, because it’s eating at me. But here goes.

I 21M and have a girlfriend, 20F — let’s call her L — who I’ve been dating since June 2023. I love this girl to bits, which is why the rest of this is so heartbreaking. Now, L has always been textbook avoidant. She doesn’t open up about her feelings, struggles in silence, and pulls away when things get tough, and the LACK of basic communicational skills is absolutely insane, (had been begging her to learn communication through our entire relationship). Although i am very much aware of how she was brought up and it stems some deep childhood issues.

However when L does love, she loves hard. She did make me feel like the only man alive and it was amazing. Although not the most affectionate and a shy girl, she still ticked every box. I genuinely thought I would marry this girl.

So here’s the issue. Coming to the end of 2024, L decided to join training for the police. To put things simply, this did not go well. She saw things there that traumatised her, and for a while she was even scared to drive at night. 

During this time period, L would not open up to me at all. She refused therapy when it was offered by the police and totally shut down from around March 2025 till November 2025.
At this point, she had pulled away from me entirely and would not let me in. She would hang out fine on weekends, but saying the wrong thing, asking her if she was okay, or any attempt at intimacy was quickly shut down. During this time, I realised that if I didn’t act fast, she was going to completely shut down, and I needed to do something before I lost her. So I gave her an ultimatum: we either hash this out now and she talks to me about what’s going on, or I walk because I can’t take this anymore.

That conversation never came, and honestly it was the most humiliating feeling ever. I’d pulled the breakup card, and there was no attempt at fighting to keep me in her life. I wasn’t even going to do it — I just wanted to feel like I meant enough to her that she’d try.
From that point, we didn’t really speak for around two weeks. 

I finally caved, took L out for food, and said let’s fix things (bearing in mind we hadn’t even broken up). She kept saying “I don’t know” and eventually said okay, but she needed time.

I respected this and waited it out. Now in December. L is finally meeting me again, slowly staying over once here and there. For about two weeks this happens, and then my worst nightmare hits. I had a gut instinct to check her phone, so I did. Lo and behold — Instagram DMs from a guy.

I didn’t even get angry. Just felt my whole world crumble in an instant. I was shaking as I read the messages, because my previous relationship ended the exact same way, and she knew how bad it hurt me. She pulled me out of that hole herself and promised never to put me in a place like that again. As you can imagine, the messages were flirty, mostly instigated on her part, along with general chat.
I found out this had been going on since November. I will note this was purely emotional there was no physical they had not met up however were planning on meeting for a coffee date while still with me...

The guy was a colleague of hers who had been at the scenes she was traumatised by when she was in the police (although at this point she had left about two months prior). I just kept asking her why. I was shaking and crying. Being avoidant, she just shut down — blank-faced, hardly answering any of my questions. She said he was just a friend, even though it was blatantly obvious from what was in front of me.

Anyway, she broke up with me but stayed over because I didn’t want her driving an hour home at about 3 in the morning. This happened around the 7th of December. We then went off and on talking till about the 21st of December, and then no contact.

I was genuinely just so broken and betrayed. I felt like I’d lost my other half — the whole mix of emotions.
Moving forward to the 30th–31st of December, she suddenly wants to see me, as we had planned a while back to do New Year’s together. However, we were broken up — so what gives?

The 31st goes well, and I ask her what is going on, because at this point I just want her back. I know the comments are going to be completely against this, but whatever. I genuinely saw myself marrying this girl and, in some ways, still do.

She says she wants me in her life but can’t commit right now because everything is just too much (how does she think I feel?). I put my foot down and explain I’m not doing that — you either want me or you don’t. I’m not a toy you can just pick up when you want to play. So she agrees to get back together with the condition of space. I said I’ll give her until the end of January to start showing me action, and we are going to talk about everything. She agrees.

So, going through January, we spoke extremely small amounts, at most a goodnight text here and there — but meet once on the weekend for a couple of hours’ walk. I dragged myself painstakingly for four weeks and finally start seeing some progress at the start of February. From then, L has been talking to me somewhat more and has been staying over on the weekends. We’ve had our talk, and it actually went pretty well. Although it was more me asking and her answering best she could. We’ve even just done Valentine’s, and that was successful. We are heading down to New Forest National Park this coming Friday for a weekend getaway, just to get a sense of normality back.

My issues now are these:
L doesn’t talk to this guy, that I know of, but will not block him. I have given her a timeframe of three months to block him, and she has agreed. I know this is unfair on my part, but I believe she may have a trauma bond at play (doesn’t make it any easier on me).

L won’t go to therapy, even though she absolutely needs to if she has any hope of overcoming this.

She does not seem to give any care into how im literally destroyed over this in an unexplainable way, and this hurts because she put me in this place but only seems to care about herself or my reactions to her actions.

I feel anxious 24/7 because I feel like L will leave me again or is texting him secretly through the week when I’m not around.

I’m not sure what to do here. I don’t know if I will ever be able to trust her again — especially not right now, as there is no real effort to fix what she shattered in me. I really dont even know what she actually wants or why she came back. Lots of unanswered questions.

Honestly, I’m just curious to see people’s opinions, even if I won’t like what I’m going to hear. I do truly love this girl, and I don’t want to give up on her, even if she hurt me. But I am at a loss about what to do now.",1,1771358419.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I think I might have a crush, and I really need your advice.

About a month ago I saw a guy on insta. He’s an animal lover(my type) and I liked a photo of him with a cat because it was really cute. I also followed him. About an hour later he followed me back. But I still haven’t accepted or rejected his follow request it’s been sitting there for maybe two months now.

Now here’s where it gets interesting.

This week I spent four days at a coffee shop. On one of those days, I saw him there. Actually I saw him on multiple days. Sometimes we made eye contact for a second or two but that was it.

The coffee shop has two sections a front and a back. When I sat in the back, he stayed in the front. He never sat near me. maybe he is avoiding me i don’t know. Plus, he might even have a girlfriend, I’m not sure. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn’t let myself get stuck on this.

Another thing is that he follows a lot of people. He has around 1000 followers and follows about 1000 people back. It seems like he follows almost everyone who follows him. Some of the people he follows are girls maybe around 60–70% (I’m just guessing). He also likes their posts.

We’ve also taken the same bus twice. So we met multiple times.

The reason I haven’t accepted his follow request is because we’ve never properly talked. I usually feel more comfortable accepting someone after we’ve had at least a small conversation and gotten to know each other a bit.

So now I don’t know… should I accept his follow request or not? Am I overthinking the fact that he follows a lot of girls?

1. Are the curtains in Concierge Veranda Rooms black out? 

2. Specialty coffees - I’ve looked at the 2 listed coffee shops on the Celebrity app but they don’t have menus or prices listed.  Anyone know about how much they charge for random lattes and such? Trying to figure out if it’s worth it for the non alcoholic drink package (We aren’t soda drinkers so I would just do 1-2 coffee drinks per day). 

3. How are the professional photos on board? Are they decent? Thinking of maybe doing our family photos there.

4. App on board - am I understanding correctly that you can communicate to others via the app while on board? None of my kids have any sort of devices but I’m wondering if we give them one of our phones while they are in the kids club, if they can contact us via the app if they need to.

5. Bonus question: Nassau - favorite things to do with kids there (3 kids under 9).  I’ve researched a few options (going to Atlantis to walk around and have lunch then back on board for the pool or Royal Beach Club but honestly, that seems pretty $$). Coco Cay is our other stop and we plan on doing a beach day then.  Welcome to suggestions! Thank you!!!",1,1771358228.0,celebritycruises,4,1.0,False

I'm trying to join the military and get healthy and have a healthy relationship with food but I cannot take my hands off sugar, and lately caffeine and chocolate has been a big issue. Like today I had a Red Bull, vente macchiato, full water bottle of caffeinated Mio drop water, a mini cup of chocolate chips, and half a hershey bar and that's literally all I've eaten today and it's noon, and I'm supposed to work out later but I feel so sick I can't eat anything else but I still want to get another coffee and eat more chocolate chips. Literally every other food feels disgusting compared to that and I don't know what to do. 

I'd been eyeballing this as a potential explanation, because I just don't know what to do. I have no control and I'll be good for a week and then give in and go crazy whenever anyone's back is turned for another week and it's just back and forth and back and forth and I'm panicking at this point, and I'm not even that overweight (5'7 and 160lbs) but I can't look at myself in the mirror because I feel like I look disgusting.

1r7gp1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1r7gp1p/random_reviews_no_rhyme_or_reason/,Random reviews: No Rhyme or Reason,"Only currently in rotation scents, no FOMO reviews:

\*\*Haus of Gloi\*\*

Magnolia Elixir EDP: this is a romantic Southern scent, a non-indolic sweet white floral. This smells like a rich lady from Georgia who wants you to remember her as a Lady, capital necessary. I get mostly musk and magnolia, almost no tonka. The cypress lends an almost lemony, woody quality. If you’ve ever wanted to smell kinda rich, you might try this one out. Don’t try if strong scents give you a headache. Do try for Beast Mode. 

Notes: magnolia petals, tonka, musk, cypress 

\*\*Cirrus\*\*

Bellano: not a blind buy but not an instant hit either. I upsized this because I kept thinking about it for some reason. To me, this is a warm weather coffee scent, where Poesies Dolce Far Niente is a winter coffee. This is a flormand, but not super floral. The coffee is very smooth and chocolatey, and the floral is bright and spring like. The lavender is very light, hard to pick up. Like sitting on the rocks along the California coastline in May with a cup of coffee long since cooled while you stared at the waves. 

Notes: Star jasmine , orange flower absolute, lavender, ambergris, clear lake water, ozone, chocolate, and a hint of coffee

It’s Just Spiced Pears: I was so worried about the anise, a death note, because I didn’t notice it until AFTER I ordered this. To my delight, I don’t get the anise at all! There is an adjacency to anise, but it’s not licorice on me, and so I count this as a win. I liked Its Just Pears but it was missing something. Spiced Pears has the same juicy quality, but with added interest. Very autumnal. Like a Fall Festival in a ritzy East Coast town. But not overly so, either. This is quite calm in the oil format but I imagine the EDP is a lot stronger. 

Notes: juicy bartlett pears, brandy, cinnamon, star anise, ginger, clove, caramel sauce, on a buttery chypre base

Antique Nouveau: I would wear this as a skin scent. Just a subtle floral with a bit of spice in the background, I like this way more than I thought I would. If the clove, coumarin, and pine scared you, don’t be skeered! This is a unisex floral, like the hand soap in a five star hotel without smelling like a bar of soap, if that makes sense? 

Notes: bergamot, oakmoss, patchouli, vetiver, coumarin, iris, jasmine sambac, heliotrope, peony, labdanum, benzoin, opoponax, pinyon pine, cedarwood, clove

Fall Creek: Growing up, my mom wore this perfume in a slender blue bottle. I think it was Davidoffs Cool Water, but I also feel like there was rain in the name. It’s been like thirty years, so I guess it doesn’t matter what it was, but this scent is its twin! This is the most distinctly perfumey of these scents to me. It’s fresh and clean and kinda juicy, but it has that 90s perfume feel, so that’s my association. I like it, don’t get me wrong. But it smells very “blue.” I don’t think any of these are particularly gendered, but this  one could be easily perceived as a bit more masculine than the previous three. 

Notes: Ice water, grand fir tips, jammy fir absolute, mossy river rocks, and a faint trail of some unknown wildflowers

Union St. Crash: I’m glad this is a free sample because it would not have been a good purchase for me. Not a winner. No ding-ding. It’s the combo of leather and cigar smoke- this smells like a rich old man who was an attorney for some huge firm and now he sits in his study and drinks to the good old days. I do not resonate with this. If you like tobacco and leather, you should give it a try though. 

Notes: Old books, cinnamon, and cognac with a spritz of lime - lightly colored with rich antique leather and a touch of cigar smoke wafting in from outside

\*\*Solstice\*\*

Chantilly Cream: if you’ve ever been wanted to smell like sweet peaches and cream in a custard base, check this one out. I wouldn’t have expected to like this one as much as I do, but the peaches are just so juicy! I think it’s the orange that brightens it. This is very sweet and creamy. Not a ton of wafting off the skin. I think this is a transitional scent. It would be too light for winter but too creamy for summer. 

Notes: Whipped Cream, Peach Nectar, Vanilla & Yellow Mandarin EO

Rose Mallow Cream: if you like baby doll heads, here is a scent you should try. This has that same sweet, powdery quality. It’s way too much for me, but I’m glad I sampled it. 

Notes: Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk

Lavender Raspberry Truffle: I love SSs truffle note. It’s this deep, dark, decadent chocolate. I thought this would be a good Valentines scent and it does smell like a raspberry truffle with lavender sauce. The lavender at first is a bit more herbal than I prefer but it does calm down. This is a sexy, chocolatey lavender. The raspberry is a tiny bit dry and powdery but it works!

Notes: White Chocolate, French Lavender, Bulgarian Lavender, Tonka, Cocoa Absolute, Raspberry",11,1771357875.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

The plan: Vancouver - Yellowknife. Two drivers. 24 hours straight. No hotel stays, just stopping for provisions and gas along the way. (Gonna be coming back the same way but let’s not think about that)   



So I have three questions:

 Other than an oil change, checking breaks and tires, and fluids, is there anything else I need to bring for the jeep? /are there any fluids I need to be checking while stopping for gas? 

  
Im probably going to be crossing into Alberta through Dawsons Creek, any spots I should take note of along the way? Favourite coffee shops/quick stops to stretch your legs?

  
Other than blankets, is there any safety gear I should bring in case of a snowstorm or w/e?

1r7gmuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1r7gmuv/the_phoenixthe_burning_girl/,THE PHOENIX!(The Burning Girl!),"Nashville, Tennessee 2018. 

""But Momma, he's not like the other boys, Momma, he's different!"" I proclaimed. 

My mother stomps back out of the kitchen to meet my gaze and yells, 

""I SAID NO, YOUNG GAL! I will not let my daughter be tainted by some uncivilized, uninformed, lustful boy! You are a virgin, Julie, and you will stay a virgin until marriage!"" 

My mother's long, straight red hair had a radiant glow as it shined under the house lights, the same lights I've grown accustomed to my whole life... I can tell by the look in Momma's green eyes that she meant business and she wasn't scared to act on it either. 

""BUT MOMMA, HE'S NOT LIKE THAT! MOMMA, HE JUST WANTS TO HANG OUT! HE WANTS TO TAKE ME TO THE MOVIES, MOMMA!"" I protest. 

But my mother doesn't like one bit of it. She marches toward me with a look of malice. She pointed her finger at me; her middle finger still had the ring Daddy gave her before he died. 

""I SAID NO, YOUNG GAL! All boys are the same! You think I didn't see how he was looking at you when I picked you up from school!?! They fill your head with lies and dreams just to get in your pants, and when they get what they want, they never treat you the same again. Trust me, I know, girl,"" my mother said in a stern tone. 

I detest her claims by saying, 

""I'm 18 years old now, Momma! If I wanna go, you can't stop me!! I'M NOT A LITTLE FUCKING GIRL ANYMORE!!"" 

My mother raised her hands and struck me hard on the right side of my face. I fell to the ground, holding my hands out to shield my face from the impact. 

“YOU WATCH YOUR MOUTH BEFORE I BEAT YOU LIKE YOU STOLE SOMETHING! AHARD HEAD MAKES FOR A SORE BUTT IT WOULD BE BEST YOU REMEMBER THAT!!” My mother yelled 

I stayed on the ground. My face stung; my eyes began to swell. Teardrops fell from my eyes. I looked at my mother crying and asked, 

""Why, Momma? Why are you like this?"" 

My mother leans down instantly, with much guilt and sorrow in her eyes she gets on her knees, trying to comfort me. She holds me close. 

""Oh, Julie... I’m sorry… I'm so sorry... Momma loves you. I just wanna keep you pure. And you know how risky it is for you to be out there. You can't control it yet, gal! You'll end up doing more damage than good!"" Momma said, combing her hands through my red hair slowly. 

"" Oh, I know, Momma. It's just I've been in this house my whole life! The only time I see the outside world is when I go to school. The other girls bully me, Momma! The same girls that have been bullying me my whole life. Why would God allow that, Momma? If He's blessed me with this gift, why must I suffer? I'm no sinner, Momma. I pray every night like you tell me to!"" I said as tears continued to roll down my cheeks. 

Momma wipes my tears away, saying, 

"" Oh, Julie... maybe the Lord is testing you, baby... God loves you... You know what the Bible says? Since the fall of humanity (Genesis 3), the world has been broken. meaning the consequences of sin, sickness, death, and decay affect everyone! Not just you. This world is just broken, those girls are broken babygirl! but you will always be perfect, Julie."" Mother hugs me tightly and kisses my forehead. 

The next day I get dressed, say a prayer, then head downstairs. Before I eat breakfast, I say a prayer. Afterwards, I go outside to wait for the bus for school. I adjust my glasses; not satisfied, I take them off, clean the lenses, and put them back on. I hold my study books in hand and look both ways of the street for the bus. I finally see it coming up the road. I wait patiently for the driver to pull beside me. He opens the door and welcomes me; I make my way to the back of the bus. 

I look around and greet everyone with a warm smile. I can feel all eyes on me as I make my way toward the back of the bus. When suddenly... 

WHAM! 

One of the girls who bullies me daily, Nancy Golddean, sticks her foot out to trip me. I fall hard on my face; my glasses fall with me as I do. I groan in pain and get back up onto my feet. I look back, giving Nancy a glare. 

She laughs with the other girls, with a conceited look on her face. She turns to me and says, 

""Watch where you’re going, you redheaded bitch."" 

I just keep looking at her in disgust, disbelief, anger, hate! I was having a flood of emotions go through me. 

""What's the matter, hoe? You going to do something about it? Well, do something then, Julianne,"" Nancy said to me. 

The other four girls laughed together. I looked around, and the entire bus was staring at me. 

I kept myself calm; I did the right thing and turned around, kept walking. This is why I sit at the back of the bus every day... since childhood... 

""Yeah, that's what I thought! Keep walking; you know you don't want these problems, Julie!"" Nancy yells at me. 

""HEY! NANCY, WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT DOING THAT!?"" yells the bus driver, 

looking up into the rearview mirror. 

""Oh, shut up, Frank, mind your business. Why don't you worry about your wife screwing the principal? Stay out of my affairs."" 

Frank grows silent and continues to drive. 

I sit in the back of the bus. Back there waiting for me was the only friend I had. Jasmine Lockheart, her brown skin radiantly glowed under the sunlight peering in the windows. Her black, puffy hair blew with the wind from the windows being down. She watched me sit down with empathic ember eyes. 

""Oh, don't listen to them bitches, Jewels. They're just jealous because you've got Vince crushing on you. Speaking of which, have you guys gone out? Jasmine asks with a look of excitement on her face.

I look at her with a disappointed expression. 

""I tried to see him last night, but of course, my mom wouldn't let me,"" I said, holding my study books tightly. 

Jasmine rolls her eyes and says, 

""Gurl! You kill me with that southern accent of yours! You and yo momma are real country!"" 

I look at her, and we both laugh together. 

Jasmine asks, 

""Speaking of which, when are you gonna stop letting your mom run your life?! I mean, you're 18; you're not gonna live with your mom forever, are you?"" 

I answered back saying, 

""Oh, Jasmine, it's not that she's trying to run my life. She just doesn't want me to make the mistakes she made... Let's just say my momma doesn't have a good history with men..."" I said, looking out the window of the bus. 

""Oh... I'm sorry to hear that... being a woman ain't easy... especially one like your momma. I know she was a real eye catcher back in the day! You're not far behind her jewels! If you would take off those glasses, you'd be a heartbreaker!"" Jasmine said with a chuckle. 

""Jasmine! You know I can't see without my glasses, gal!"" I said, smiling. 

We both laughed and joked the rest of the way to school. Later that day, after lunch period, I shut my locker door and was met with Stacy standing behind it with Nancy and the rest of her fiendish crew. 

""Hey, four eyes, so I heard you and Vince have been playing boyfriend and girlfriend. You guys fucking or what?"" Stacy asks me. 

I turned away, trying to ignore my bullies as I made my way to class through the empty hallway. Stacy and the four other girls followed me. 

""Don't walk away from me, slut! I'm talking to you!"" Stacy said as she ran up behind me and pushed me to the ground. She and the four other girls hovered over me, exchanging menacing looks with each other. 

""There's nothing going on between us, 

alright?! We're just friends!"" I proclaimed to the girls. 

Stacy wasn't having it. She picked me up by the shirt collar and slammed me into the nearest locker door. 

""Do I look dumb, bitch? Stop lying to me."" 

She was the ringleader of the group. She had dirty blonde hair, rosy cheeks, black eyeliner, brown eyes, and a fit body. 

""Why do I gotta tell you, Stacy? It's none of your business?!"" I shouted. 

""TRAMP! It is my business because I’ve been dating him for four years!"" Stacy said, raising her fist in anger. 

I held my hands up in defense, yelling, 

""NO!!"" 

Locks began to snap off the lockers around us, one by one. The locker doors violently opened, and books and belongings flew out of the lockers around us and onto the floors. 

""WHAT IS GOING ON OUT HERE?! STACY, UNHAND THAT YOUNG LADY AT ONCE, AND WHY ARE ALL THESE LOCKERS OPEN? ! LOOK AT THIS MESS!"" the English teacher, Mr. Vergil, shouted, running out of his classroom. 

Stacy slowly let go of me as she and the other four girls looked at each other in horror and disbelief. Stacy turned to Mr. Vergil and said, 

""I- I- I... don't know what just happened..."" 

I ran away crying, heading to my next class. 

When I got home, I told my mother what happened. 

""Why do you care about what some whores have to say about you? They have no idea what you're capable of...""

Chapter 2 WHATS IN THE BOX? 

The next day at school, Jasmine runs up to catch up with me after chemistry class. She yells out for me while pushing through the crowd of teens around us. 

""Jewls! Hey Julie!! Wait up!"" 

I turn to face Jasmine, who is now behind me, catching her breath. 

""Damn girl, why you gotta make a bitch run like that?"" Jasmine asked in her Bronx accent. 

""Sorry Jazz, I didn't know you were behind me,"" I said, giving her a hug. 

""Sooo guess who gets tickets to go see Death Punch!?! I got an extra one for you!"" Jasmine said excitedly. 

""WHAT!! No way! They're in Tennessee!?!"" I asked eagerly. 

""Yup! The concert's Friday, and you're coming with me!"" Jasmine said, reaching out her hand to give me the ticket. 

I grip my study books tighter and look away. 

""Gee Jazz, I really would love to, but you know how Momma would feel! And this concert starts at 3, Jasmine; we would have to leave school early just to make it,"" I said, 

feeling bad. 

""So?! We'll just have to leave school early then! I do drive, you know,"" Jasmine said as she shot me a reassuring smile. 

""Oh girl, please! If you drive, why do you ride the bus?"" I asked, giving her a curious look. 

""Umm, to save gas money for one, and for two, my dad just gave me his old car! I passed the driving test yesterday! Girl, this means we can travel like we always wanted to! What's wrong, Jewls? You don't look excited! You look like somebody kicked your puppy,"" Jasmine said, putting her hands on her hips. 

""Because Jazz, you know both of us know my mom picks me up from school every day! If she finds out I left school early to go to a concert, she'll kill me!"" I said. 

""Oh girl, why don't you live a little! Trust me, Jewls, it'll be worth it. And hey, if your mom says anything, just tell her I kidnapped you,"" Jasmine said, trying not to laugh. 

We both giggle. 

""You're a real nut, you know that, Jasmine!"" I said as she walked with me to class. I looked at the time and knew we were going to be late. After school, Jasmine pulled me to the side and said, 

""Hey Julie! I got something for you!"" 

She said as she handed me a box wrapped up like a Christmas present. 

""Whatever you do, don't let your mom see that!"" She said as she walked to her car. 

""What is it? "" I asked. 

""It's a surprise, is what it is!"" She shouted back! 

""This better not be anything dirty, Jasmine!"" I said, smiling as I rolled my eyes. I headed back to my mom's car. 

I opened the car door and got inside. My mother immediately looks at me, then looks down at the box, and back to my eyes again. 

""What's that?"" She asked me in her signature Southern accent, with an earnest look on her face. 

""Oh nothing, Momma, it's just a gift from Jasmine,"" I replied nervously as I thought of what Jazzy had told me. 

Jasmine's words echoed in my head: ""Whatever you do, don't let your mom see that!"" 

I held the gift tightly in my lap as I unzipped my backpack to place it inside. 

""Obviously, I can see it's a gift, Julie. I'm asking WHAT is the gift? You can't just go accepting things from people who don't share the same values as us!"" 

""What's that supposed to mean, Momma?! And how am I supposed to know?! It's supposed to be a surprise,"" I proclaimed, with my head down, trying not to look nervous. 

""Now, I don't mind you having friends, Julie, but I just got a bad feeling about that young gal!"" My mother said, looking out at the road as she drives us home. 

I look out the window, watching the trees blur from motion, the beautiful birds in the sky, the city of Nashville in the distance. I take a deep sigh, knowing I'll probably never be able to see it for a long time... 

""Jasmine's not a bad girl, Momma; she means well... I've known her since kindergarten; you know that."" I told my mother as I watched cars pass us by out the window, resting my head on my hand. 

""Yeah, well, friends are temporary; family is forever. You remember that, gal. Blood runs thicker than water; mother knows best! When we get home, you need to wash those dishes and finish the laundry!"" my mom said, focusing on the road. 

I let out a miserable sigh and replied, 

""Yes, Mother..."" 

Later that night, I snuck out of bed. I tiptoed through the hallways to my mother's room. I slowly peeked my head inside to make sure she's asleep. I see Momma snoring in bed, laying down on her left side. I slowly go to close the door. I flinch as the door creaks while I begin to shut it! 

CRRREEEKKKK 

""Oh no!"" I thought to myself. 

""Julieanne!? What are you doing?"" my mother asked from behind the door. 

""Oh nothing, Momma; I was just checking to make sure you were alright!"" I replied nervously. 

“I'm fine. Now go to bed you have school tomorrow I don't know why your roaming the house late at night anyways. Off to bed young gal!” my mother said sternly 

Ye- yes mother!” I said hurrying back to my room I quietly shut the door,. 

“I unwrap the gift Jasmine gave me. It was a glitterly silver dress. It was obviously made to show off a womans thighs! The dress gleamed and sparkled. It was beautiful! 

“Oh goodness.. it’s magnificent.. it’s like looking at magic! Oh… if mother seen me in this she would a heart attack.” I said after I try on the dress in the mirror. My thighs was exposed but for the first time in my life…. I felt beautiful… I take off the dress and stuff it neatly back into the box and go to bed preparing for the next day. 

Chapter 3 YOUNG AND INLOVE 

3 days pass and it's now Friday the day of the death punch concert. Jasmine meets me in the hallway after class. 

“You ready? Did you bring the dress?”Jasmine asked excitedly 

I look around nervously and say 

“I did! Jasmine are you sure about this? I just don’t know how mom will feel. I don’t wanna make her upset…” 

“Relax!! It’ll be fine we’ll be home before dinner! I’m sure your momma won’t care that much. Sure she’ll be mad at first but she’ll get over it. You haven’t let her see the dress have you?” Jasmine asks

“No! Why would I? What made you get my this dress? You know how my mom is! She catches me in this I’m dead!” I say to Jasmine walking with her through the school hallway to her locker. 

“That’s why you don’t show her goofy” Jasmine said putting away her school work and backpack.

I hear a deep voice call out from behind me.

“Hey Julie!” 

I turn around it’s Vince! I get so shy my heart feels like it’s going to fly out my chest!deep inside I wanted to jump up and down like a fan girl! I feel myself get hot I have to look away. 

“Oh uh hey Vince how are you?” I asked nervously looking the other way avoiding eye contact. 

“I’m doing good how about yourself? Is everything okay? I was really looking forward to seeing you last Saturday..” Vince says putting his hands in his school varsity jacket. A group of boys can be seen smiling behind him yelling 

Get her Vince!” 

Vince looks at the boys with a smug expression and flips them off. Then he focuses his back on me. His blue eyes, his olive skin, his sharp jawline, his long black hair with the fade on the side, his diamond eye rings, his white smile!, his muscles!!, his neck tattoo! Gosh I thought I was going to faint. 

“I’m so sorry Vince my mother needed me home that night. Look Vince you’re a really nice guy but I just don’t think I’m what your looking for…I mean I’m a church girl and you’re this popular jock.. my mother has very… unique beliefs…” I said looking down at my feet gripping my study books tighter. 

Jasmine just staring at us both intrigued, like she was watching some drama film.

“So?! That’s what I like about you your not like other girls Julie.. you got standards and I respect that.. look can we plan something later? Come on Julie you know how we feel about each other. I wanna see you outside of school. I wanna take you to the city and explore!”  Vince says as he holds my hands. 

“Ooohhhh you go girl!” Jasmine cheers 

I become to get overly nervous I can feel my skin heat up and my face turn red. My body gets hotter and hotter and hotter until…

“OW!!!” Vince says yanking his hand away a sizzling sound can be heard as he looks at his burned hand. 

“OH MY GOODNESS! Vince! Are you okay!?!” I shout immediately grabbing his hand checking for any damage. His hand was completely red. I hold his hand close to me and I try to sooth the pain away. 

Vince laughs nervously and says 

“Wow! Hot on the inside and out huh?” 

“Oh Vince..” I said holding back the urge to kiss him. 

When suddenly Stacy comes out of nowhere  and pushes us off each other. 

She looks at Vince then looks at me then back to Vince in anger she says 

“What the fuck are you doing!?!” 

“No! What the fuck are you doing?” Vince replies holding his aching hand.  

“You really out here shaking up with his broad!?  Wow Vince you really downgraded’ Stacy says before she turns her attention back to me. 

“As for you just because we aren’t together don’t mean he still isn’t mine you stay the fuck away from him bitch!” Stacy says furiously while balling up her fists 

“YOU CAN’T OWN SOMEBODY!” I shout at her 

“AND YOU CAN’T WHOOP MY ASS BITCH!” 

Stacy shouts louder

“ATLEAST I GOT ONE STACY!” I holler back 

Stacy strikes me in the face knocking me to the ground instantly giving me a bloody nose she gets on top of me and raises her fist preparing to beat on me even more. 

Vince grabs her from behind lifting her off me saying 

“Aye girl chill you tripping!” Vince shouts as he pulls Stacy off me 

 I get back I could feel my hands getting hot..my body begins to heat up… suddenly Jasmine steps infront of me saying 

“Back the fuck up before you get smack the fuck up stacy.”  Jasmine said bravely defending me. I wipe the blood off my nose using my shirt. 

“You alright? Jasmine asks 

I’m fine thanks jazz…” I said feeling miserable. 

“Come on jewels we got plans anyway!” Jasmine says grabbing my hand and guiding me to the exit. As she went to leave I hear Stacy shout behind me 

“THIS ISN’T OVER HOE!!”   



Chapter 4 THE FLAMES

After some time later me and Jasmine sneaks out to the concert. I couldn’t help but feel worried and scared thinking how my momma would react when I return… I tried to put the thought in the back of my mind and focus on having fun. This was my first time being out the house in 14 years! I was very excited! 

I step out the bathroom wearing the glittery silver dress. I look in the mirror at my body and do a joyous spin! I felt wonderful! 

“How I look?” I ask Jasmine her whole reaction told me all I needed to know. 

“You look amazing girl! You gonna be the real star of the show out there! Now come on let me put some make up on you.” Jasmine said getting her make up kit ready

“WHAT!? No you never said anything about make up! It’s bed enough I’m going home late now you’re trying to doll me up. My mom won’t like that at all!” I proclaim to jasmine.

“That’s why you wash it off before we go home duh!” Jasmine said as she powdered my face and applied the make up. Takes off my glasses to When she was done she asks

“What do you think?” 

“I love it I feel so beautiful! I haven’t felt pretty in years… thanks Jasmine! You’re the best friend ever!” I said giving Jazz a hug.

“No problem now let’s go out there before it gets too crowded. We make our way through the crowd I can feel eyes staring at Me. Men giving me smiles and looks of interest. I felt… beautiful…. Once infront of the stage We Watch and cheered as Death punch performed their hit songs! The guitars playing loudly, the riffs, the drums. Their vocals matched up so well! We could barely contain ourself 

I watched as the stage pyrotechnics trick shot flames into the air. I watched the flames becoming… entranced… It almost seemed like the flames was speaking to me.. trying to say something.. .I watched as they soared high into the sky… part of me wanted to see them forever..  then suddenly I feel a hand touch my butt! 

I turn swiftly and it’s an old man in his 40s looked old enough to be my dad. 

 “Keep your hands offf me!” I shout 

The old man said “sorry it was an accident I got pushed!” 

The crowd of people around us was dancing and headbanging their heads. I let it slide thinking to myself maybe it was an accident. I resumed dancing I turn to my right to see Jasmine talking to some guy who looked like he was 23. He was nodding his head in agreement to whatever they were discussing. Then suddenly I feel the hand touch my butt again! I turn around and it’s the old man! I get angry I said 

“Okay that time I know it wasn’t an accident keep your hands off me or I’ll get security!” I screamed at the man behind me in anger

As I begin to yell the stage pyrotechnics fire begins to lift up. It felt like I was magnetically connected to the flames… I get this weird feeling in my hands… 

“Sorry it won’t happen again I promise”

The old man said 

I go to turn facing the stage again when suddenly I feel a hand smack my butt! 

I turn around one final time and I scream at the top of my lungs 

“I SAID STOP!!!!”

Suddenly the old man goes flying up 20 feet into the air. It was as if he was thrown! screaming as he descended further and further into the sky. Everyone looks up in shock! Including the band members when Suddenly… The stage pyrotechnics fire lifted up… The air begins getting hotter and hotter. It was humid like summer time. I closed my eyes and screamed all I could think of was fire… 

I open my eyes and stare with much anger and hate as the man flies higher. I look at the flames and they do the rest… suddenly a fire ball appears from the stage pyrotechnic trick. The fireball rockets into the air hitting the man before he lands with a great thud and splatter engulfing him and the entire area around him in fire. Him along with many other scream as they catch on fire too. The fire spreads person to person rapidly. I look around me still seeing visions of fire in my eyes. I snap out of it when I feel Jasmine grab my hand and yell

“WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE! COME ON!!” Jasmine said as she grabs my hand and we make our way out for the exit. 

along with everyone else running in panic. People begin catching on fire and screaming around us. Even the lead singer of death punch was rolling on the ground trying to extinguish his flames! I gasp in disbelief and fright! 

“Oh my goodness… did- did… I do this..” I whisper to myself. 

The stage lights rotate in circles as people burn to death and others ran for freedom. I could still hear people’s screams when we left the concert. 

I was silent the whole car ride home I stared at the moon for what felt like forever. I looked outside the window and take in the city lights, enjoying it as much as I can not knowing when I’ll be able to see it again. I watch as we leave the city I couldn’t help be feel so guilty.. did I sin?.. was it my fault?.. deep down I knew it was.. I.. I… I didn’t mean to kill them.. I didn’t mean too… 

I couldn’t help but feel guilt the whole car ride home. Mother was right… I shouldn’t have came outside. I’m not ready… I let my mother down and I killed people who may or may not deserved to die.  

After 30 minutes of driving, we finally arrive at my house. 

""I'm sorry for what happened tonight , Jasmine,"" I said to Jazz, looking at my house from the side. Part of me didn’t wanna leave the car…the other part of me knew I had too… Jasmine turns to face me and told me:

""It's okay, Jewels! Don't worry about it. I still had fun... well, at least I did until the end... but it wasn't your fault! Blame it on the promoters, Stageco, TAIT Towers, whoever made that damn stage! I’ve never seen flames do that before... it was weird... that was very scary... almost like the flames had a mind of its own… anyways I hope I don't have to experience anything like that again in my life. It was like the flames were moving on their own... well, anyway, it's 9:00 PM. I didn't think we'd be gone for so long; I'm sorry. You better head inside."" Jasmine says as she gives me a hug. 

We say our goodbyes, and I get out of the car. I look down at the dress and feel the makeup still painted on my face. I look at my phone: ""9:39 PM."" 

My heart drops to my stomach. I begin to walk to the front door of my house nervously… I get scared; my heart thumps harder and harder as I put in the house key and open the door. All the lights in the house are completely off. Momma is not going to be happy... To make things worse, I am still wearing the makeup and dress! I didn't have time to change... I had a bad feeling growing in my stomach...

 

 Was momma asleep? I tiptoed to my room as quietly as I could. When suddenly I heard my mother's voice call out from behind me, from the living room. 

""JULLIANNE ROSE ASHFORD GET YOUR BEHIND IN HERE RIGHT NOW!!!"" Mother yelled. 

I carefully made my way back down the hall, hesitating to walk into the living room. I peeked behind the doorway, and my mother was sitting there in the dark. She had a drink in her hands. Oh no... Mother's been drinking again... 

""Momma, please, I gotta go to the bathroom,"" I said, worry evident in my voice. 

""YOU CAN HOLD IT! NOW GET IN HERE!"" My mother yelled. 

I looked down, defeated, and slowly walked into the living room. I stood there in the middle of the room, my head down in shame. My mother turned on the lamp, and the color drained from her face. Her jaw dropped in disbelief. She slammed her shot glass on the coffee table and stomped towards me. 

""MOMMA, PLEASE LET ME EX-"" I pleaded, 

but my mother slapped me hard across the face with much aggression and force. Over and over again until I felt my skin burn red. My face burned and swelled. 

""OW, MOMMA, PLEASE!"" I pleaded. 

My mother kicked me as I curled into a ball, shielding my face. 

My mother stomped over to the wall, grabbed the hand mirror, then marched back to me, holding the mirror to my face. She yelled and screamed with anger. 

""LOOK AT YOU! YOU LOOK LIKE A WHORE! I WILL NOT TOLERATE DISOBEDIENCE IN MY HOUSE!"" My mother yelled as she continued to beat me. Her palms turned into fists. 

I screamed out in pain! 

""MOMMA, STOP! YOU'RE HURTING ME!!"" I yelled. 

My skin grew hot, extremely hot. However, I didn’t sweat at all. I just felt my body get even more hotter until I heard a sizzling sound coming from my mother's hands and fists. 

My mother pulled back and screamed in pain as smoke emitted from her hands. The hissing and sizzling sound could still be heard as she looked down at her shaking hands, now red and swollen. 

Then she looked back at me and yelled, 

""JULIE ASHFORD!!! HOW DARE YOU!!"" My mother said as she stormed off into the kitchen. 

""MOMMA, NO! IT WAS AN ACCIDENT! I DIDN’T MEAN TO!"" I yelled back. 

My mother went into the kitchen and grabbed the broom, the weapon she beat me with while I was growing up. She twisted off the brush and began to beat me with the broom over and over. 

My head, legs, and arms were all getting battered and bruised; I even bled a little... 

""OW! MOMMA! OW! STOP, MOMMA! AHH! I'M SORRY!"" I protested. 

My mother wasn't listening; my words went in one ear and out the other. She yelled and screamed as she beat me,

""WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, HUH? TELL ME!! I BIRTHED YOU, I RAISED YOU, I FEED YOU, I PROVIDE YOU SHELTER, AND FOR WHAT?!? FOR YOU TO GO OFF AND BE A WHORE!? I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THAT GIRL! LEAVING SCHOOL EARLY, MAKING ME LOOK BAD!"" My mother yelled as she beat me with the broomstick again and again. 

Once I started to bleed from my eyebrows to my lips, my ribcage began to bruise and swell, and I was getting a headache from the strikes to my head. I grabbed the broom handle. 

My mother let go and quickly stepped back in fear. 

I gripped the broom handle; and broke it over my knee. I could feel my body heating up to extreme temperatures. I felt like an oven. I could feel my eyes getting hot, as if I were looking into the sun. 

Fire... Fire was coming out of my eyes. 

I yelled, 

""THAT'S ENOUGH!!"" 

I began to cry, and I could feel the heat cooling down, and my vision began to clear again. I started crying uncontrollably. I just couldn't stop. 

""I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Momma ... I'm so sorry... I'm sorry, Momma .... I'm..."" Tear after tear streamed down my face . 

My mother looked at me, then looked at her hands and back at me. It seemed like she was sobering up now. She had a guilty and sad look on her face. My mother began to cry too... 

"" Oh, Julie... Momma's sorry too... I know you want to grow up and be a woman, but the truth is, being a woman isn’t easy, princess... especially for you. Julie, you can create life and destroy it! You want to be part of a world that doesn't understand you... a society that won't accept you either with open arms. Do you have any idea what the government will do when they find out about you and your gift!? The truth is... MOMMA IS JUST TRYING TO PROTECT YOU!!! BECAUSE SOMEDAY MOMMA WON'T BE HERE TO PROTECT YOU ANYMORE, JULIE!! Yes, that's right... someday it will all be up to you, my dear child."" My mother came to me and embraced me in a hug. 

I couldn't help but push her away as streams of tears rolled down my face. 

""WHY MOMMA!? I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY ME!? WHY WAS I NOT BORN NORMAL?! THIS AIN’T FAIR I HURT PEOPLE TONIGHT, MOMMA. I KILLED PEOPLE..."" 

I shouted at my mother. 

The look of empathy and sorrow on my mother’s face quickly shifted. Her expression reverted back to one of disdain and disgust after hearing this. 

""I warned you about hanging out with that gal! This is all her fault! If she would've never pressured you into going, none of this would have happened! There's no doubt this will make the news. Julianne Rose Ashford, I don't want you seeing that girl again!"" My mother said to me with a stern expression on her face. 

I looked back, teary-eyed, shouting, 

""NO MOMMA!! WHY!? JASMINE DOESN 'T MEAN ME ANY HARM, MOMMA! YOU ALREADY TOOK MY FREEDOM AWAY, AND NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY MY ONLY FRIEND!?"" 

My mother refuses to hear me out, screaming, 

""MAY THE LORD FORGIVE YOU! HOWEVER, IF YOU WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ME AND STAYED INSIDE, NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. YOU DID THE SAME THING TO THEM THAT YOU DID TO YOUR FATHER!!"" 

I look up, teary-eyed, and give my mother a look of disbelief and confusion. I shout back, 

""WHAT!?!? HOW DARE YOU SAY SUCH A THING, MOMMA? YOU KNOW IT WASN'T MY FAULT!"" 

You can tell that my mother is visibly still displeased with me. She screams at me, 

""WELL, YOU DID!! AND TONIGHT YOU DID WORSE!! JULIE, THIS WILL KEEP HAPPENING UNTIL YOU LEARN HOW TO CONTROL IT!!"" 

""I'm trying, momma! I'm trying!!! You don't understand what it's like to feel... to feel... like a monster!!! An ugly monster that nobody likes!!"" I shouted, wiping tears from my face. 

I run upstairs to my room, crying... 

My mother shouted back at me, 

""JULIE?!?? JULIANNE?? Don't you turn your back on me when I speak to you, young gal!"" 

I run upstairs anyway, ignoring my mother. I go to my room, slam, and shut my door. 

My mother can be heard calling for me downstairs, 

""JULIE??"" 

""LEAVE ME ALONE! THIS AIN'T NO DOGGONE GIFT! IT'S A CURSE!"" I shout back through the door. 

I run to my bed and spend the rest of the night crying, listening to Hank Williams' ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry."" 

I spend the majority of the night curled up in a ball... I think to myself about everything 

I’ve done... the deaths I caused... the screams... the emotions. I am lying in bed, depressed, with one thing on my mind. 

""Tomorrow I WILL learn how to control it. I won't let my gift control me!"" I say to myself before crying myself to sleep.",1,1771357746.0,libraryofshadows,1,1.0,False

1r7glgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1r7glgi/my_situation_is_hell/,My situation is hell.,"Well, I’m not even sure where to start with this or what I’m getting out of it — just to vent, I guess, because it’s eating at me. But here goes.

I 21M and have a girlfriend, 20F — let’s call her L — who I’ve been dating since June 2023. I love this girl to bits, which is why the rest of this is so heartbreaking. Now, L has always been textbook avoidant. She doesn’t open up about her feelings, struggles in silence, and pulls away when things get tough, and the LACK of basic communicational skills is absolutely insane, (had been begging her to learn communication through our entire relationship). Although i am very much aware of how she was brought up and it stems some deep childhood issues.

However when L does love, she loves hard. She did make me feel like the only man alive and it was amazing. Although not the most affectionate and a shy girl, she still ticked every box. I genuinely thought I would marry this girl.

So here’s the issue. Coming to the end of 2024, L decided to join training for the police. To put things simply, this did not go well. She saw things there that traumatised her, and for a while she was even scared to drive at night. 

During this time period, L would not open up to me at all. She refused therapy when it was offered by the police and totally shut down from around March 2025 till November 2025.
At this point, she had pulled away from me entirely and would not let me in. She would hang out fine on weekends, but saying the wrong thing, asking her if she was okay, or any attempt at intimacy was quickly shut down. During this time, I realised that if I didn’t act fast, she was going to completely shut down, and I needed to do something before I lost her. So I gave her an ultimatum: we either hash this out now and she talks to me about what’s going on, or I walk because I can’t take this anymore.

That conversation never came, and honestly it was the most humiliating feeling ever. I’d pulled the breakup card, and there was no attempt at fighting to keep me in her life. I wasn’t even going to do it — I just wanted to feel like I meant enough to her that she’d try.
From that point, we didn’t really speak for around two weeks. 

I finally caved, took L out for food, and said let’s fix things (bearing in mind we hadn’t even broken up). She kept saying “I don’t know” and eventually said okay, but she needed time.

I respected this and waited it out. Now in December. L is finally meeting me again, slowly staying over once here and there. For about two weeks this happens, and then my worst nightmare hits. I had a gut instinct to check her phone, so I did. Lo and behold — Instagram DMs from a guy.

I didn’t even get angry. Just felt my whole world crumble in an instant. I was shaking as I read the messages, because my previous relationship ended the exact same way, and she knew how bad it hurt me. She pulled me out of that hole herself and promised never to put me in a place like that again. As you can imagine, the messages were flirty, mostly instigated on her part, along with general chat.
I found out this had been going on since November. I will note this was purely emotional there was no physical they had not met up however were planning on meeting for a coffee date while still with me...

The guy was a colleague of hers who had been at the scenes she was traumatised by when she was in the police (although at this point she had left about two months prior). I just kept asking her why. I was shaking and crying. Being avoidant, she just shut down — blank-faced, hardly answering any of my questions. She said he was just a friend, even though it was blatantly obvious from what was in front of me.

Anyway, she broke up with me but stayed over because I didn’t want her driving an hour home at about 3 in the morning. This happened around the 7th of December. We then went off and on talking till about the 21st of December, and then no contact.

I was genuinely just so broken and betrayed. I felt like I’d lost my other half — the whole mix of emotions.
Moving forward to the 30th–31st of December, she suddenly wants to see me, as we had planned a while back to do New Year’s together. However, we were broken up — so what gives?

The 31st goes well, and I ask her what is going on, because at this point I just want her back. I know the comments are going to be completely against this, but whatever. I genuinely saw myself marrying this girl and, in some ways, still do.

She says she wants me in her life but can’t commit right now because everything is just too much (how does she think I feel?). I put my foot down and explain I’m not doing that — you either want me or you don’t. I’m not a toy you can just pick up when you want to play. So she agrees to get back together with the condition of space. I said I’ll give her until the end of January to start showing me action, and we are going to talk about everything. She agrees.

So, going through January, we spoke extremely small amounts, at most a goodnight text here and there — but meet once on the weekend for a couple of hours’ walk. I dragged myself painstakingly for four weeks and finally start seeing some progress at the start of February. From then, L has been talking to me somewhat more and has been staying over on the weekends. We’ve had our talk, and it actually went pretty well. Although it was more me asking and her answering best she could. We’ve even just done Valentine’s, and that was successful. We are heading down to New Forest National Park this coming Friday for a weekend getaway, just to get a sense of normality back.

My issues now are these:
L doesn’t talk to this guy, that I know of, but will not block him. I have given her a timeframe of three months to block him, and she has agreed. I know this is unfair on my part, but I believe she may have a trauma bond at play (doesn’t make it any easier on me).

L won’t go to therapy, even though she absolutely needs to if she has any hope of overcoming this.

She does not seem to give any care into how im literally destroyed over this in an unexplainable way, and this hurts because she put me in this place but only seems to care about herself or my reactions to her actions.

I feel anxious 24/7 because I feel like L will leave me again or is texting him secretly through the week when I’m not around.

I’m not sure what to do here. I don’t know if I will ever be able to trust her again — especially not right now, as there is no real effort to fix what she shattered in me. I really dont even know what she actually wants or why she came back. Lots of unanswered questions.

Honestly, I’m just curious to see people’s opinions, even if I won’t like what I’m going to hear. I do truly love this girl, and I don’t want to give up on her, even if she hurt me. But I am at a loss about what to do now.",1,1771357664.0,AvoidantBreakUps,2,1.0,False

""JULLIANNE ROSE ASHFORD GET YOUR BEHIND IN HERE RIGHT NOW!!!"" Mother yelled. 

I carefully made my way back down the hall, hesitating to walk into the living room. I peeked behind the doorway, and my mother was sitting there in the dark. She had a drink in her hands. Oh no... Mother's been drinking again... 

""Momma, please, I gotta go to the bathroom,"" I said, worry evident in my voice. 

""YOU CAN HOLD IT! NOW GET IN HERE!"" My mother yelled. 

I looked down, defeated, and slowly walked into the living room. I stood there in the middle of the room, my head down in shame. My mother turned on the lamp, and the color drained from her face. Her jaw dropped in disbelief. She slammed her shot glass on the coffee table and stomped towards me. 

""MOMMA, PLEASE LET ME EX-"" I pleaded, 

but my mother slapped me hard across the face with much aggression and force. Over and over again until I felt my skin burn red. My face burned and swelled. 

""OW, MOMMA, PLEASE!"" I pleaded. 

My mother kicked me as I curled into a ball, shielding my face. 

My mother stomped over to the wall, grabbed the hand mirror, then marched back to me, holding the mirror to my face. She yelled and screamed with anger. 

""LOOK AT YOU! YOU LOOK LIKE A WHORE! I WILL NOT TOLERATE DISOBEDIENCE IN MY HOUSE!"" My mother yelled as she continued to beat me. Her palms turned into fists. 

I screamed out in pain! 

""MOMMA, STOP! YOU'RE HURTING ME!!"" I yelled. 

My skin grew hot, extremely hot. However, I didn’t sweat at all. I just felt my body get even more hotter until I heard a sizzling sound coming from my mother's hands and fists. 

My mother pulled back and screamed in pain as smoke emitted from her hands. The hissing and sizzling sound could still be heard as she looked down at her shaking hands, now red and swollen. 

Then she looked back at me and yelled, 

""JULIE ASHFORD!!! HOW DARE YOU!!"" My mother said as she stormed off into the kitchen. 

""MOMMA, NO! IT WAS AN ACCIDENT! I DIDN’T MEAN TO!"" I yelled back. 

My mother went into the kitchen and grabbed the broom, the weapon she beat me with while I was growing up. She twisted off the brush and began to beat me with the broom over and over. 

My head, legs, and arms were all getting battered and bruised; I even bled a little... 

""OW! MOMMA! OW! STOP, MOMMA! AHH! I'M SORRY!"" I protested. 

My mother wasn't listening; my words went in one ear and out the other. She yelled and screamed as she beat me,

""WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, HUH? TELL ME!! I BIRTHED YOU, I RAISED YOU, I FEED YOU, I PROVIDE YOU SHELTER, AND FOR WHAT?!? FOR YOU TO GO OFF AND BE A WHORE!? I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THAT GIRL! LEAVING SCHOOL EARLY, MAKING ME LOOK BAD!"" My mother yelled as she beat me with the broomstick again and again. 

Once I started to bleed from my eyebrows to my lips, my ribcage began to bruise and swell, and I was getting a headache from the strikes to my head. I grabbed the broom handle. 

My mother let go and quickly stepped back in fear. 

I gripped the broom handle; and broke it over my knee. I could feel my body heating up to extreme temperatures. I felt like an oven. I could feel my eyes getting hot, as if I were looking into the sun. 

Fire... Fire was coming out of my eyes. 

I yelled, 

""THAT'S ENOUGH!!"" 

I began to cry, and I could feel the heat cooling down, and my vision began to clear again. I started crying uncontrollably. I just couldn't stop. 

""I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Momma ... I'm so sorry... I'm sorry, Momma .... I'm..."" Tear after tear streamed down my face . 

My mother looked at me, then looked at her hands and back at me. It seemed like she was sobering up now. She had a guilty and sad look on her face. My mother began to cry too... 

"" Oh, Julie... Momma's sorry too... I know you want to grow up and be a woman, but the truth is, being a woman isn’t easy, princess... especially for you. Julie, you can create life and destroy it!

""I warned you about hanging out with that gal! This is all her fault! If she would've never pressured you into going, none of this would have happened! There's no doubt this will make the news. Julianne Rose Ashford, I don't want you seeing that girl again!"" My mother said to me with a stern expression on her face. 

I looked back, teary-eyed, shouting, 

""NO MOMMA!! WHY!? JASMINE DOESN 'T MEAN ME ANY HARM, MOMMA! YOU ALREADY TOOK MY FREEDOM AWAY, AND NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY MY ONLY FRIEND!?"" 

My mother refuses to hear me out, screaming, 

""MAY THE LORD FORGIVE YOU! HOWEVER, IF YOU WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ME AND STAYED INSIDE, NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. YOU DID THE SAME THING TO THEM THAT YOU DID TO YOUR FATHER!!"" 

I look up, teary-eyed, and give my mother a look of disbelief and confusion. I shout back, 

""WHAT!?!? HOW DARE YOU SAY SUCH A THING, MOMMA? YOU KNOW IT WASN'T MY FAULT!"" 

You can tell that my mother is visibly still displeased with me. She screams at me, 

""WELL, YOU DID!! AND TONIGHT YOU DID WORSE!! JULIE, THIS WILL KEEP HAPPENING UNTIL YOU LEARN HOW TO CONTROL IT!!"" 

""I'm trying, momma! I'm trying!!! You don't understand what it's like to feel... to feel... like a monster!!! An ugly monster that nobody likes!!"" I shouted, wiping tears from my face. 

I run upstairs to my room, crying... 

My mother shouted back at me,

I have now done 5 batches, all in a standard oven on a baking tray. Apart from 1 mishap when I got greedy and put way too many beans on the tray I have been amazed by the results! Obviously price and simplicity but most of all the improved taste and crema!

Unfortunately I am sucker for gadgets and want more from the process and therefore would like a roaster for home use.

As for most people the current choice for me is between the Kaffelogic 7 and Gene Cafe 101 or 301. At the moment I am leaning towards the Nanologic due to promises on better chaff removal, less space requirements, less smoke/extraction requirements, more adjustment possibilities and better cooling.

I have just read an in-depth comparison on greencoffeecollective.com and one of the considerations was that air roasters were preferred for lighter roasts! Now I prefer a darker roast for espresso and latte, so should I be concerned about this? Or is this a reason to choose a drum roaster?

Is there really a taste difference between the two types (when using the same beans and roasting to the same darkness?

The following is a snippet from the comparison on greencoffecollective.com

What’s the difference between air roasters and drum roasters?

The main difference between air and drum home coffee roasters is how the beans are heated and moved during roasting.

Air roasters (fluid-bed) for home roasting

Air roasters use hot air to both heat and agitate the beans. The beans float and tumble in a stream of heated air as they roast.

In simple terms:

Faster roast times

Brighter, cleaner flavour profiles

Lighter body

Typically smaller batch sizes

They suit home roasters who:

Prefer lighter roasts

Enjoy clarity and acidity

Want a simpler, lower-maintenance setup

Within this guide’s price range, the Kaffelogic Nano 7e is the strongest air-style home coffee roaster option.

Drum roasters for home roasting

Drum roasters use a rotating drum heated from the outside. The beans tumble inside the drum and roast more gradually.

In simple terms:

Slower roast development

More body and sweetness

Greater potential for deeper flavour development

Often slightly larger batch sizes

They suit home roasters who:

Prefer medium to darker roasts

Want a more traditional roasting feel

1r7ghk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/1r7ghk3/this_changed_my_life_naps/,This changed my life (naps),"I’m treating this as a post to myself because as a FTM that’s constantly on Reddit— I hope I had read this. As all mothers that are desperate to put their babies to sleep I hope this helps you.

My son is now a week away from being 4 months old (he just entered the regression). And since he was 2.5 months we struggled with putting him to sleep as most moms do with their babies, I suppose. At that point I really committed to using the Huckleberry app to help with suggesting nap times and wake windows since that was raved about in every website or forum. It did help sometimes, it wasn’t huge. Things got exponentially harder at 3 months when he knew we were entering the bedroom each time. At this point he was YELLING once we entered the room because he knew that we’d battle for the next 30 minutes. As time went by it mattered less whether we were 30 minutes earlier or right on the dot of the suggested times. And I didn’t understand!!! I did my part right?? I committed, I bounced on that yoga ball, covered his eyes, shushed loudly in his ear but sometimes things just got worse.

Until one day, I “gave up”. You want to stay up? Let’s do it. In that day I learned something magical. That when his brain and body matched up, he would fall asleep beautifully when we entered his sleeping space. I was amazed. I saved my back, my son’s patience and most importantly my sanity. At this point I was going to therapy because being a mom was emotionally exhausting everyday and doing this battle 5x a day was pushing me over the edge. I was so. So. Miserable. I was so caught up in meeting his schedule out of fear of encountering sleep debt and dealing with the repercussions before bedtime or at night. I was protecting myself before anything happened!!! I’m on my third day of calling it, “care free” parenting, or maybe I can call it “life before technology”. But let me say, it’s working out beautifully. My son goes to sleep in under 5, MAYBE 10 minutes. And he falls deeper asleep, and for Me?!? I show up as a happier mom. Truly.

So, this is what I do…. Huckleberry will notify me the time to put my baby to sleep for any given nap. This happens to align with when he begins to fuss. In that moment I analyze his body. If he’s hyper, full of energy, rigid or just not quite there. I just hold him close. I pick him up, maybe take him outside while I talk on the phone, then go inside and put clothes away with one hand, maybe read a book to him in a dim light. I kill time, while I hold him close. I do whatever until eventually his body softens and he’s regulated. Even at that point, I still wait because **he will tell me**. The moment I see a deep yawn or a small protest, that’s my cue to give it a try and sway him. My limit is 20 minutes. If he doesn’t fall asleep in that time, we’re moving again and going about my day. Shit, maybe I’ll go out on a fun outing. Life goes on. Eventually, his tired brain, soft body and a rhythmic motion will get him there.

A couple things:

\- the way that which he gets regulated doesn’t matter. You could be making yourself some coffee in silence while you hold your baby. You can try cleaning your counters with one hand. Sit in the sun in silence. Whatever you want it, just do it in peace

\- the 20 minute mark where I “give up”, when I’m rocking him intentionally to sleep, is random. I chose it since this is my breaking point and I don’t want to keep trying anymore

\- lastly, he falls asleep beautiful when his brain is ready for a nap, but most importantly when his nervous system has been regulated through hugs. Those two systems must align, and after that if he cues in the form of a yawn or protest, you go FOR IT.

Maybe some mothers found this obvious from the beginning…. I sure didn’t. So here it is for mothers who are treating these apps and textbook WW/nap durations as bible.

I have a law degree and a job I love. Amazing friends. An apartment I adore. Hobbies that keep me busy. I'm attractive and smart and funny and kind. 

But I feel like I have been so unlucky in love. Last year I thought I met ""the one"" and was devastated when he ended things rather abruptly, only to come back and admit that he *was* in love with me but that he couldn't do it. We're human, of course, but the dynamic was always respectful and fun and we had a lot of care for each other. I really don't understand why he didn't want to work it out, but I accepted his decision and we didn't see or talk to each other for the next 5 months.

I've tried to move on, but most dates have been deeply disappointing, and nothing has gone past date 3. Lately my body has been craving nothing more than to be held, which I feel pathetic writing, but it's true. I'm not someone who can generally do one night stands and I don't get attached often, so I know it'll probably be a while before I connect with someone deeply enough to have that again. I did have a fwb for a little while, but he met someone new so the little bit of relief that offered is gone too. 

To make matters worse, my ex recently saw me reading at a coffee shop and came up to chat with me. I was polite but told him I thought it was best we didn't speak, and went home and cried. I could hardly even look at him without getting choked up. I can't remember the last time I've felt this way about someone, and right now can't imagine it happening again. I've been having dreams about him and feeling so incredibly hopeless and sad. 

I just feel....hopeless. I'm 30 and I know that most people my age are already taken. It feels like the odds of finding someone I love, who loves and chooses me back, are dwindling. But I want that so bad and have been feeling so deeply lonely for that kind of relationship lately. How do I get out of this grief spiral? ",3,1771357291.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

1r7ge1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1r7ge1x/why_most_diets_fail_and_what_actually_works/,Why most diets fail and what actually works: slow-carb explained (no BS),"Most people start diets with hype, then fall off in 2 weeks. Not because they’re lazy. But because most diets aren’t built for real life. Way too complex, unrealistic, or just plain miserable. You’re not wired to white-knuckle your way through cravings forever.

That’s why the Slow-Carb Diet blew up. It’s not a magic bullet, but it actually fits human behavior. Tim Ferriss popularized it in *The 4-Hour Body*, then Dr. Andrew Huberman broke it down further on his podcast. And unlike most fad diets, this one’s been tested by thousands of people, and backed by research on satiety, blood sugar, and habit formation.

Here’s the deconstructed, no-fluff guide to how and why it works:

**1. Eat the same few meals over and over.**  
Decision fatigue kills consistency. According to Columbia Business School professor Sheena Iyengar, too many food choices increase stress and reduce satisfaction. The Slow-Carb Diet solves this by sticking to simple meals made of lean proteins, legumes, and non-starchy veggies. Think eggs, lentils, spinach, chicken, black beans. This keeps blood sugar stable and cravings low.

**2. Avoid “white” carbs.**  
No bread, pasta, rice, cereal, or fried foods. Ferriss calls these “domino foods”, once you start, you binge. Huberman explains how refined carbs spike insulin, which triggers energy crashes and hunger rebounds. Multiple studies (like this meta-analysis from *The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*) show diets lower in processed carbs lead to more sustainable fat loss.

**3. Eat protein with every meal.**  
Tim Ferriss recommends 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking up. Huberman also pushes for early protein intake, it helps regulate dopamine and satiety signals for the whole day. Research from the *University of Missouri* found high-protein breakfasts reduce late-night snacking and help with weight management.

**4. Don’t drink calories.**  
Liquid sugar (soda, juice, etc.) is one of the fastest ways to gain fat. According to the *Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health*, sugary drinks lead to excessive calorie intake without fullness. The diet allows water, unsweetened tea, black coffee, and occasional red wine.

**5. Take one cheat day a week.**  
Yes, seriously. Saturday = eat whatever. This isn't about “rewarding” yourself. Ferriss says this boosts leptin, the hormone that regulates hunger and metabolism. A study in *Obesity (Silver Spring)* even found planned diet breaks can help maintain weight loss by preventing metabolic adaptation. It’s also a psychological pressure release to keep you going long-term.

This isn’t about perfection. It’s about building a system you can stick to without burning out. No tracking macros. No starving. Just repeating what works.

So...

Mandatory military service ruined my life. And something that I found funny was how disgusting I found nice officers to be. Not performatively nice. Like, actually nice officers. Recently, a counselor told me that conscription, or at least my experience of it, sounds like a form of institutional abuse. And that I'm traumatized. My mother- Who is a military veteran, but had a radically different experience and never experienced being a conscript- Has said the same thing.

Well, if it was abuse, then any of those officers who weren't abusers were still enablers. My mom will admit that. She'll admit she was. But I love her because she does everything that she can to understand me, now, and help me heal. Anyhow, there was this officer there, Katerina, I'd say she's in her 30s and was all motherly with me. I think what it was is that, like... Because I look like a girl? And I don't mean like a feminine boy, I mean, literally, people joke about me being basically a woman with a you-know-what. I don't care, I grew my hair out now because I refuse to cut it, I feel pretty. Anyway, at one point, my relationship was falling to bits and after not seeing my girlfriend for three months, I asked her if I could have time off. She felt awful about it, got me a long weekend, then. Or when she kept telling me about this ""cool"" barber down the road and how she'd be happy to give me the money since I apparently needed to get my hair cut because it was getting too long... Or when she gave me her phone number, or sends Christmas and birthday presents since I got back...

And looking back, I find her disgusting. I was falling to bits. So a few days ago, I snapped at her over the phone. Yeah, because I just LOVED her bringing me out for boring, stupid walks, going for coffees and as if it meant anything. But she's still friends with my parents, you know? Says that she wants to help me heal, and wants to give me something, if that's okay with me. I was hoping it would be something cool, so I thought, yeah, alright.

So... She had this bike. Not like a fucking Harley, I mean more like one of these moped things, hasn't used it in years and it's a bit old and all this, but said that me and my dad could maybe repair it and then I could use it. And I'm... Honestly, I'm offended. I'm completely offended.

Seriously, I get put through the most disgusting year of my life, being told by her to try and make the best of it, that maybe it's not all bad but just different, trying to be a fucking mom when the one I have is just fine- And for all that shit, I get this shitty bike? And repair work that you're supposed to pretend is rewarding when it's just shit? That's it? That's fucking IT?

1r7gcgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/1r7gcgn/daily_life_on_a_motorcycle_pickup/,Daily life on a motorcycle pickup,"I’ve been trying out a motorcycle pickup as my full-time ride lately, and it’s honestly surprised me in ways I didn’t expect. There’s this instant sense of agility you don’t get with a regular bike or a car, you weave through tight spots, glide past stalled traffic, then roll up to your stop without worrying about parking drama. The little flatbed has become my favorite part of the whole setup. I’ve hauled everything from my weekly groceries to a small desk I impulse-bought, and it handles it like it was built for chaos. Of course, using a motorcycle pickup every day has its moments. Morning commutes on rough roads can turn your coffee run into a balancing challenge, and windy days sometimes make you feel like the air itself is negotiating with you. But the low running costs make it easy to forgive. Fuel barely makes a dent, and the maintenance is simple enough that you don’t feel stressed every time something rattles or squeaks. I’ve also had fun customizing it bit by bit. I even found a few unique add-ons on Alibaba that I couldn’t source locally, which made the whole setup feel more tailored to how I actually ride. For anyone else using a motorcycle pickup daily, how’s your experience been? Is it a long-term keeper or just a phase you’re testing out?",1,1771357131.0,whatcarshouldIbuy,0,1.0,False

We are hosting another Daytime Social at Creeds Coffee Bar, 450 Dupont St. on Saturday, Feb 28 from 3 to 6 PM. If you have been to one of these before, you know the vibe. If not, it is a relaxed, playful afternoon where strangers become friends over coffee, light games, and easy icebreaker activities that help the event flow naturally.

This event is perfect if you

\* Like being out during the day and want a calmer social atmosphere

\* Have plans at night but want something fun in the afternoon

\* Are new to Toronto and want to meet people

\* Love coffee or coffee shops

Tickets are free right now and there are plenty available, but the last two events sold out on the same day, so I recommend getting yours early. Once free tickets are gone, they will be $5. 

You can grab a ticket at this link: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/daytime-social-by-social-creatures-tickets-1982897863889?aff=oddtdtcreator

Creeds is spacious, welcoming, and has amazing coffee, drinks, and food. Please support the venue as they are kind enough to give us the space.

A lot of Redditors on this page have met up at previous events, and it is always so rewarding to see people leave with new connections or even plans to hang out afterward. Past events have been amazing, and I would love to see some new faces this time.

Come for the coffee, conversations, and enjoy a relaxed Saturday afternoon with good people.

1r7gbc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1r7gbc4/dear_customers_please_do_not_be_creepy_to_other/,"Dear customers, Please DO NOT be creepy to other customers!","I’m a barista and have been for 11 years now. I typically don’t go to Starbucks on my days off and get my markouts on days I work. One of my friends from where I grew up just moved to my area (2 hours away) and started at a Starbucks very close to my main job. I figured during lunch I would go and visit her while she was working and get my coffee markout while I was there.

There is no reason any customer from this store should recognize me as a barista btw. I only cover shifts here 1x per year, and less now that we don’t get mileage. My current store is also 30 minutes away from this one, with about 10 other stores in between. I was also wearing my work shirt for my main job with the companies logo on it. 

So I went to pick out the coffee I wanted to markout, got in line, and this other customer sees me and stands super close to me. I first thought “okay, this line is long, maybe he’s just trying to stand out of the way.” I moved over, then he moved closer. Then he starts talking to me asking “what’s good here?” I really wasn’t in the mood to talk to a complete stranger, so I just said “idk, I’m only here to get this pound of coffee and visit a friend” … then he said “well I’m here with my friend and need to know what to get!” Okay, and that’s my problem because?? I just shrugged and said sorry. Then he started asking if I was planning on drinking that pound of coffee at home, and when I said I don’t drink coffee, he started asking if I was giving it to someone like a boyfriend or something. His questions just kept getting creepier. All the while, he kept standing super close to me. Like I’m sure the person at the register thought we were together by how close he was standing. 

Ugh, I feel so gross from that interaction. That store was so slow too, probably short staffed, but still. I just needed the line to move faster than it did. 

During that whole interaction, I didn’t make a scene, and he didn’t make a scene, and after getting back to the office, I started wondering how often things like that happen to our customers where to us it looks like two people standing in line for drinks who potentially know eachother, but in reality it’s one person making a conscious effort to make the other complete stranger as uncomfortable as possible.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but even if I’m trying really hard to stay awake in class, while reading in the middle of the day, or more concerningly, on drives over an hour, I find it almost impossible unless I’ve gotten ten hours of sleep the previous 2 nights.

I’m currently on SSRIs but I have the same problem without them and without any daily medication.

My therapist basically said “oh well” and told me that women biologically need more sleep than men. Sure, but ten hours? I’m graduating into the workforce soon and in a serious relationship and it doesn’t feel sustainable. So far I’m scraping by and almost always getting those cruel ten hours each night, but I’m too exhausted to feel like doing any hobby activities by the time I’m caught up with essential responsibilities.

I drink a serving of black tea every morning. I’ll probably switch to coffee, but I’ve drank it before and the difference is negligible. I just feel like I’m missing out on so much *life.*

1r7g8ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/1r7g8ce/whats_your_reaction_response_or_analysis_of_this/,"What’s your reaction, response, or analysis of this passage from MlK’s letter from a Birmingham jail?","We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was ""well timed"" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word ""Wait!"" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ""Wait"" has almost always meant ""Never."" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ""justice too long delayed is justice denied.""

We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, ""Wait."" But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million \[black\] brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is asking: ""Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?""; when you take a cross county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading ""white"" and ""colored""; when your first name becomes ""\[n-word\],"" your middle name becomes ""boy"" (however old you are) and your last name becomes ""John,"" and your wife and mother are never given the respected title ""Mrs.""; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a \[black person\], living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of ""nobodiness""--then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience. You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: ""How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?"" The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that ""an unjust law is no law at all.""

RIP Jesse Jackson. As the leaders of the civil rights movement pass away, may we who remain prove ourselves worthy of that legacy, and advance the cause of human rights for all.

I’m 37, live in London, hoping to meet someone I actually enjoy talking to.

* I read a lot: history (currently very Europe-focused), John le Carré when I want something atmospheric, and at the moment The Sum of Us by Heather McGhee, which is thoughtful, infuriating, and oddly hopeful
* I like conversations that wander a bit — books that stay with you, cities you’ve loved or disliked, why certain photos work, how history quietly shapes the present. I’m more curious than loud, more reflective than chaotic.

Looking to meet someone kind, curious, and capable of a decent chat — whether that turns into a swim buddy, museum wandering, coffee dates, or something more is open-ended and human.

Everything is nicely dialed in but I'm running into something strange.

I make 2 espressos per day. One at 8 am and one at noon. I use a smart switch so it preheats for 20 minutes and then I also have a temperature probe to make sure it's not too hot and needs to be flushed.

My first coffee I do 20.5g in and roughly 40g out in 30s. Without changing anything on the grinder and doing the same puck prep, my second coffee ends up going much faster with hitting 40g out in 25s or sometimes even closer to 20s.

At first I thought it was related to dialing in my grind but I found I was just going back and forth every day after each one until I finally stopped messing with it and noticed how it keeps fluctuating like this every time.

Any ideas on what's going on? I can't think of anything being different other than that for my second coffee, the machine is still relatively warm when it turns on but I have the temperature probe so I know it's still ending up at the same temperature (96C). If the machine has been on too long and I purge it etc I still get the same consistent difference.

  
Edit: May be worth mentioning that I'm using a bottomless portafilter and not getting any spraying so I don't think it's something like channeling causing it to brew faster. ",0,1771356367.0,espresso,2,0.33,False

1r7fy3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1r7fy3q/lovehate_relationship_with_vietnam/,Love-Hate relationship with Vietnam,"I travelled Vietnam for a month in December - January as a part of a broader southeast Asia trip, and was super excited because a lot of people I had met told me it was so wonderful.

I have had an overwhelmingly great experience in all of the countries I visited so far (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, China, Malaysia) but I'm very honestly a bit conflicted and disappointed by Vietnam given how great it's supposed to be. There were a lot of things I really enjoyed and a lot I really didn't. 

Pros:

\- The landscapes were absolutely stunning and the synergy between culture and nature is one of a kind (e.g. the temples on the lakes and cliffs in Ninh Binh, the Ha Giang loop, Ha Long bay...). It's probably the most visually stunning place I have ever been.

\- Everyone and their dog knows Vietnam is super affordable and cheap. Hostels and street food cost pennies. 

\- There is just so much to see and do, from hiking in Sapa to crawling in tunnels and seeing weird religions around HCMC and everything in between.

\- The coffee 

\- Transportation was really easy (grab, trains, night busses)

Cons:

\- Hanoi: how can I feel more claustrophobic on the street than I would being stuck in an elevator?

\- Phu Quoc: this might actually be the worst place I've ever been to and it's everything wrong with the modern world.

\- Food: I don't know why people keep gaslighting themselves that the food here is good. It's not disgusting or anything, but it's a prison diet consisting of barely flavored water with leaves, baguettes, or barely seasoned fried rice. I kept having to splurge (still cheap) on Indian food to compensate for the Vietnamese dishes' absence of flavor. It was a shocking downgrade from the flavor paradise of Thai food. I also don't like pork belly, which might be the reason I don't like the food.

\- The locals: I found this country to be really unwelcoming. I can count on one hand all of the positive interactions I had with locals in a month. I often got shouted at to exit busses etc and I got the feeling that street vendors, coffee shops and the like wanted nothing more than for me to be gone. In the south it was a bit better tbf.

Sometimes I felt like I was caught up in a conspiracy by the locals to make me pay as much as possible or to have as shit of a time as possible, even if it didn't benefit them at all. It was also super difficult to have positive interactions with locals because of the intense scamming, even outside touristy areas, it's a scam 95% of the time when someone asks me my name or where I'm from. One time I dismissed one of them and he replied ""no no I am not working"", I took the bait and after becoming my ""friend"" he rinsed me.

After meeting many friendly locals in Thailand, Laos and China, I really had to adjust my expectations and keep reminding myself that these people are not my friends. 

I do feel a bit of nostalgia building up now looking back. It might be worth it to give Vietnam a second try at some point given that I had some quite bad weather during my stay.",0,1771356290.0,solotravel,50,0.43,False

I am planning to try out carnivore diet for the 1st time. My main goal is weight loss, but since reading the posts here, I am also curious about the mood and mental effects because mood instability and sleep issues have been lifelong hurdles for me.

I have some questions for the experienced ones:

1. If my goal is just weight loss and I would be committing to 1,5 - 2 months, is it even worth it? I will go back to balanced diet later on (which is mediterranean style), since I am worried about long term effects for heart health etc. But the reason I want to give it a go for weight loss, is a) curiosity if it actually works and b) I haven't been able to shed 2-4 extra kg that I would like with my current meal planning.
2. What can I drink? I don't drink alcohol or coffee, if anything warm, I drink green/black/herbal teas. I start my morning with lemon water and I do have a habit of drinking celery&cucumber juice from time to time. Is the juice out of question?
3. What kind of meats should I consume for the diet to work it's most effective way? Should I stick to beef or also include pork and chicken? Haven't really eaten pork in couple of years.
4. How do you bring variety to your meals? I am used to asian type seasonings for my food, but there is lot's of sugar in there, I know. Have you quit all seasoning except salt and pepper?

1r7fspa,https://www.reddit.com/r/tombihn/comments/1r7fspa/ack_a_packable_daypack_and_why_the_daylight_in/,ack a packable daypack — and why the Daylight in Spectron is my pick,"*Repost — accidentally deleted the original.*

I see a lot of one-bag and travel loadout posts here, but not enough discussion about what I think is the most underrated piece in a travel kit: a dedicated packable daypack. Here's the case for one, and why — after evaluating several options and owning a few TB bags in both Ballistic and Halcyon — I went with the Daylight Backpack in 420d Spectron.

---

### Four reasons to pack a packable

**1. Decouple transit from destination.** Your main bag stays packed at the hotel. Your daypack handles museums, groceries, and ""I swear I didn't plan to shop"" moments. You're not hauling a 30L+ bag around a city all day.

**2. The flight-home hack.** Bought stuff on the trip? Deploy the daypack as your personal item, main bag goes overhead. No scrambling, no gate-check roulette.

**3. Splash zone protection.** Cafés, beaches, markets, theme parks — let the daypack take the abuse instead of your Techonaut or Synik.

**4. Everyday carry (EDC) crossover.** It lives flat in a bigger bag, your car, or your office. The moment you need a bag, you have a bag. I've used mine for gym runs, grocery hauls, and coffee shop days where a Synik 30 is overkill.

---

### Why the Tom Bihn Daylight Backpack (DLBP)

Most packable bags feel like a grocery sack with string for straps. The DLBP hits a pragmatic middle — it's a real backpack that happens to pack flat.

| Spec | Detail |
|---|---|
| Volume | **17L** — ASTM ball-fill tested, not inflated marketing |
| Weight (420d Spectron) | **15 oz / 430g** |
| Weight (630d Ballistic) | 1 lb 2 oz / 510g |
| Dimensions | 11.8"" × 17.3"" × 5.1"" |
| Exterior | 420d nylon ripstop w/ 400d Spectra® UHMWPE grid |
| Lining | bluesign® 210d Cerylon 6,6 ripstop |
| Zippers | #5 YKK coil, plastic sliders |
| Hardware | Duraflex, Nexus, Woojin |
| O-rings | 5 total (3 main compartment, 2 front pocket) |
| Straps | Contour, 3mm closed-cell foam + removable sternum strap |
| Made | Seattle, USA. Lifetime guarantee. |

**Five things that matter for a packable specifically:**

- **Packs flat, not into a pouch.** It doesn't stuff into a tiny ball — it lays dead flat. Slides behind packing cubes or into the laptop compartment of a Techonaut 45 like it's not there. Can double as a packing cube itself (a common TB forum trick — pack your clothes in the DLBP, then deploy it at your destination).
- **Honest volume.** No external bottle pockets being counted means this 17L holds as much as many competing ""20L"" packs that inflate their numbers with stuffed mesh side pockets.
- **Updated straps.** The old webbing-only straps were the #1 community complaint for years. The current Contour straps with foam padding and a sternum strap are a genuine improvement. Not Synik-level comfort, but nobody's writing angry forum posts about them anymore.
- **Museum trick.** Some European and Asian museums require you to check or bag your backpack. The DLBP rolls up small enough to tuck under your arm or stuff into a Packing Cube Shoulder Bag (PCSB) when you hit a security checkpoint. Try doing that with a Synik.
- **Airline friendly.** At 11.8"" × 17.3"" × 5.1"", it fits under the seat on most full-service carriers and meets carry-on size limits on 90% of the 146 airlines in Pack Hacker's dimension comparison. Budget carriers with strict personal-item limits (Ryanair, Spirit) may be tighter — check your airline.

**Other details worth noting:**

- Diagonal front zip — longer opening than a standard horizontal zip, easier grab-and-go access
- 2 overlapping internal pouches on the back panel replace a padded back panel to save weight. Put a tablet or laptop in a sleeve back there and it acts as structure. Clever dual-purpose design.
- 5 O-rings for tethering TB pouches and accessories — build your own organisation
- Removable waist belt included — useful for bike rides or longer walks

### Why Spectron over Ballistic

For a bag that gets repeatedly folded and stuffed into another bag, fabric choice matters more than usual.

| Factor | 420d Spectron | 630d Ballistic |
|---|---|---|
| Weight (DLBP) | **15 oz / 430g** | 1 lb 2 oz / 510g |
| Packability | Flexible, folds easily | Stiffer, resists folding |
| Abrasion (Taber) | Good — better than Halcyon per TB, but lower than Ballistic | Best of the lineup |
| Pet hair | Smooth, doesn't grab | Grabs fur and lint |
| Water resistance | Among the best in the TB lineup | Good |
| Aesthetic | Black-on-black diagonal ripstop grid, subtle sheen | Classic, structured look |
| Scuffing | Resists visible scuffs | Shows minor scuffs through normal use |

**The short version:** Spectron saves you about 2.8 oz over Ballistic (~16% lighter) while being reinforced with a 400d Spectra® UHMWPE grid — a fibre known for exceptional tensile strength. It folds and rolls without the stiffness of Ballistic fighting you when you're cramming it back into your travel bag. And it doesn't attract pet hair, which Ballistic absolutely does.

**One caveat:** Spectron has historically only been available in black. TB recently introduced Bordeaux as a second Spectron colourway across the lineup, though availability varies by bag — check the product page for current DLBP options. If you want more colour choices, Ballistic has a wider selection.

**For the Halcyon alumni:** Spectron is TB's successor to the retired 400d Halcyon. Similar lightweight, flexible hand feel, but with a UHMWPE ripstop grid and updated construction that addresses Halcyon's well-documented issue of polyurethane (PU) coating cracking at fold lines over time (a recurring topic on the TB forums), though Spectron still uses a PU back coating — time will tell if the updated formulation holds up better. TB spent nearly two years developing it; the first production run launched in January 2025.

---

### Honest trade-offs

No point in a fact-based post if I only share the good stuff:

- **No external water bottle pocket.** Your bottle goes in the front diagonal pocket or the main compartment. Flat bottles (Nalgene flask, Platypus, HydraPak) work best in the front pocket. An insulated bottle works fine in the main compartment — just know it's eating interior space. (See my water bottle fit guide for the DLBP entry if you want specifics.)
- **No back panel padding.** The overlapping pouches are the workaround — put a flat item back there (tablet, laptop in a sleeve, folder) and it acts as a panel. It works, but it's not spacer mesh and foam.
- **Not a heavy-load hauler.** Keep it under ~10 lbs and you're golden. Load it with 15 lbs of camera gear for a full-day hike and you'll feel those Contour straps. This is a daypack, not a Synik.
- **Minimal structure when empty.** It's a floppy bag with nothing in it. That's the packability trade-off. Contents give it shape.
- **Front pocket and main compartment share depth.** At only 5.1"" deep, stuffing the diagonal front pocket eats into main compartment space and vice versa. Not a problem with a light carry, but noticeable if you're filling both to capacity.

---

### Quick note on alternatives

Yes, there are lighter packable daypacks (Matador FreeRain22 at 10.6 oz, Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil at 2.5 oz) and more structured ones (Mystery Ranch In and Out 19, Osprey Daylite). As someone mentioned on the original post, Nanobags are also worth a look — smaller and great for EDC in slings, which is how I use mine. But for travel specifically, the DLBP sits in the middle — it's not the lightest or the most featured, but it's the one that doesn't feel like a compromise in either direction. The ultralight stuff-sacks trade away real straps and durability. The structured options don't pack flat. The Daylight threads the needle.

---

### Who this is for

Anyone who travels with a larger primary bag (Techonaut 45, Aeronaut, rolling suitcase) and wants a real daypack at their destination — not a flimsy ultralight stuff-sack. Also works as a legitimate light EDC for days when you don't need your full kit.

---

Curious what everyone else is running as their ""always packed"" day bag — DLBP, Packing Cube Backpack, Pilot, PCSB, something non-TB, or no packable at all?

Hey everyone,

I started my espresso/cappuccino journey about a month ago — and I went into full deep-dive mode pretty quickly.

I began with a De’Longhi Dedica EC685, but I realized fast that the stock portafilter wasn’t great. So I upgraded to a bottomless portafilter and bought a Eureka Mignon Specialità grinder to really start dialing in properly.

At the same time, I’ve been constantly reading about coffee, diving into books, and listening to coffee podcasts whenever I can. I also completed an online barista course that was optimized specifically for the Dedica.

# Current Setup

Here’s what I’ve upgraded on my Dedica:

* Bottomless portafilter
* IMS basket for single shots
* Puck screens
* Water filter for the tank
* WDT tool
* Tamper
* Leveler
* Dosing ring
* Tamper mat

I’ve also just ordered an Acaia Lunar to replace my old scale. I chose it because I want to measure flow rate and really understand what’s happening during extraction — I enjoy experimenting with different recipes and dialing in variables as precisely as possible.

# Where I’m At Right Now

Now I’m starting to wonder…

Did I buy the wrong machine?

It feels like maybe I should have done more research before buying the Dedica. The Profitec Go seems like it would be perfect for me.

My coffee profile:  
I drink about 1–2 cappuccinos per day.

# My Question

Should I stick with the Dedica for a while longer and continue learning on it?

Or would it make sense to sell it and upgrade to a Profitec Go already?

I’d really appreciate your thoughts and experiences.

we had no idea what was coming next.

What began as a simple desire to create something better — something intentional — turned into something far more meaningful.

Late nights testing syrups.

Adjusting sweetness by grams.

Balancing flavor notes so the finish lingered just right.

Asking ourselves, “Is this refined enough to carry our name?”

This wasn’t about adding another flavor to a menu.

It was about elevating the experience.

Every handcrafted syrup we create is layered with purpose.

Balanced.

Deliberate.

Built to complement the espresso — not overpower it.

What we didn’t expect…

was how much it would reshape the way we think about coffee.

This is the standard now.

Hey everyone,

I started my espresso/cappuccino journey about a month ago — and I went into full deep-dive mode pretty quickly.

I began with a De’Longhi Dedica EC685, but I realized fast that the stock portafilter wasn’t great. So I upgraded to a bottomless portafilter and bought a Eureka Mignon Specialità grinder to really start dialing in properly.

At the same time, I’ve been constantly reading about coffee, diving into books, and listening to coffee podcasts whenever I can. I also completed an online barista course that was optimized specifically for the Dedica.

# Current Setup

Here’s what I’ve upgraded on my Dedica:

* Bottomless portafilter
* IMS basket for single shots
* Puck screens
* Water filter for the tank
* WDT tool
* Tamper
* Leveler
* Dosing ring
* Tamper mat

I’ve also just ordered an Acaia Lunar to replace my old scale. I chose it because I want to measure flow rate and really understand what’s happening during extraction — I enjoy experimenting with different recipes and dialing in variables as precisely as possible.

# Where I’m At Right Now

Now I’m starting to wonder…

Did I buy the wrong machine?

It feels like maybe I should have done more research before buying the Dedica. The Profitec Go seems like it would be perfect for me.

My coffee profile:  
I drink about 1–2 cappuccinos per day.

# My Question

Should I stick with the Dedica for a while longer and continue learning on it?

Or would it make sense to sell it and upgrade to a Profitec Go already?

I’d really appreciate your thoughts and experiences.

The cruise departs from Florida.  
Our itinerary is St.Kitts & Nevis, San Juan, CocoCay.

I have been on a cruise before, just once, many years ago on Royal Carribean and I have fond memories.  
It will be her first time on any cruise.  
I was planning for two week on cruise but figured it would be better to do one week since its her first time. And we will plan to do something else for the remaining week.  
We are a long distance couple so It will be our first time together for 2 weeks at a time so I want to be prepared.

We have booked a Sky suite (s1) directly from Celebrity's website.

My concern was that we are both vegetarians. She eats eggs if they are in desserts but I dont. I see that they have vegetarian menus so she should be fine.  
I can't additional have Onions or Garlic (Alliums) in my food. so pizza sauces or anything that has Onion/Garlic even in powder form is a no go for me. Will I have vegetarian food (No meat, no eggs, no onions, no garlic, no green Onion/Garlic either) that I can have on the cruise?  
Do I need to email someone about it or I have to figure this out while we are on board.  
Can the butler help?

We also dont drink alcohol. I think our sky suite comes with drinks package right?  
The app was asking me to buy the packages like wifi or drinks or what not. So I am not sure whats included with the retreat/sky suites?

Will we have mocktails and coffee options included?

We will have access to Luminae restaurant. Will they help with the dietary restrictions?

whats up with the aqua class amenities? There's additional charge for that?

Celebrity cruises seems to have options on flight tickets/hotels etc. Is it worth looking into these?

Also how do we best prepare best for the days when ship docks at Basseterre, St kittis & Nevis (Day 4) And San Juan, Puerto Rico (Day 5), CocoCay (Day 7)? Are the excursions bought on ship worth the value?

How do we make the most of this trip. Its months away but I am trying to be prepared. Any Tips/tricks/help will be appreciated.

1r7ff14,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/1r7ff14/test_anxiety/,Test anxiety,"One of the most common reasons people have difficulty getting the test scores they are capable of is test anxiety. You know what you are doing, you have practiced a million times and gotten your target score, but when you arrive  on test day, your head goes blank and you can’t even understand what you are reading. Here are some of the tips I give my students to help overcome that.

1: Practice how you play.

Some practice can be casual, but when you are in the closing weeks before the test, take it like its the real deal at least a few times. Take it at the time your test is scheduled for. You don't get to go on your phone, your breaks should be the length allowed on test day. Don't take it in your room(unless you are an online test taker). Maybe in the library, or just in a different room of the house/apartment. No music, no snacks(except in the middle test break). Be strict about it.

2: Rituals(not the creepy kind)

My favorite analogy for rituals is sports. When a basketball player steps up for a free throw, they do the same actions each time. They dribble the ball x amount of times throw it from one hand to the other, and take the shot. Same with tennis players on a serve or any high level athlete before a game. These rituals can help you become more comfortable, and more importantly help you reach the same mind state you are in during practice. For me, I would have an omelette, have two cups of coffee, read three news articles the same way I do reading comprehension, listen to some classical, and stretch.

4: Stress Management (model stolen from a psychiatrist)

Stress and performance exist on a bell curve. Stress is on the X axis and performance is on the Y. As stress sits at zero, performance is poor. This is a situation where the test taker does not take the test seriously. Not a very common problem for the lsat. As stress increases, so does performance, until the peak of the curve. At this peak, you reach what i call flow state. The adrenaline is pumping, you are moving quickly, and thoughts are flowing freely. This state is the goal of stress management. As stress increases further, performance takes a dive. This is where people encounter test anxiety. So the next question is, how do we move on the X axis. Practice and rituals play a role in this, but there are other methods. Meditation, prayer, breathing exercises, and even hypnosis have been known to effectively reduce stress. Find what works for you.

5: Remember

There is no bear. I know you all hate hearing this, but it really is just a test. Regardless of what happens, you are going to be ok. Your life is not in danger, and your worth is not determined by the test score. When I noticed my stress level spiking during practice or even test day, I took a moment to remember that there is no bear.

In a modern-day San Francisco where magical creatures and monsters live openly among humans, Oddie Saltbrook, a witty yet anxious merman florist, has carved out a quiet, comfortable life on land. His days are simple: make sure Rosalind, his distractible mothkin coworker, actually shows up (and stays focused); grab coffee from Lily, his human best friend and secret crush, at the café down the street; and keep his boss’s beloved flower shop, Maple Street Florals, running as her retirement looms.

Life may be small, but it’s safe — and it’s his.

That is, until a secretive real estate tycoon sets their sights on the neighborhood. What seems like a straightforward corporate buyout soon reveals layers of strange magic and dangerous secrets lurking just beneath the surface.

To save his job and prove his worth to his traditional underwater family, he’ll have to embrace the magic, face down a mysterious threat, and risk everything, including his heart, for a future he can finally call his own.

Sea Blooms is an 72,000-word adult cozy urban fantasy set in modern-day San Francisco, where magical beings live openly among humans. It will appeal to fans of Legends & Lattes and The House in the Cerulean Sea, with its mix of found family, a wholesome romance, and lighthearted magic.

Three hundred and forty dollars a month. That was what she asked for, with absolutely no acknowledgment of what she had done to me twenty years ago.

I didn't say anything at first. I just looked at her. And then I said, ""You mean the rent he couldn't afford because he dropped out of the business degree you paid for with my college fund?""

The look on her face. I've seen worse. I've seen families get news in hospital corridors that changes everything in thirty seconds. But something about her expression right then, that particular mix of shock and irritation, told me she genuinely thought I had forgotten. Or forgiven. Or both.

I hadn't forgotten a single second of it.

I was seventeen when my grandmother died and left a specific amount to my mother with the instruction that it go toward my education. My mother told me about it. Showed me the number. I had started looking at application fees, figuring out timelines. I thought that was the moment my life opened up, because I had wanted to be a doctor since I was nine years old and had watched a surgeon explain my father's diagnosis to our family with this calm certainty I had never seen in another human being. I wanted to be that. I had wanted it for eight years.

Four months before I sent my first application, my mother sat me down and told me she had used the money. For my brother's tuition. He had just gotten into a business program two states away, and the housing deposit alone was more than she had. So she had taken my grandmother's money, the money with my name on it in a letter that I had read with my own hands, and she had written a check for my brother's future.

When I asked why, she said something I have thought about almost every week since. She said, ""He needs it more. You'll get married. Girls always land somewhere.""

I did not get married until I was thirty-four. I am forty-one now.

What I did instead was take out every loan available to me, work two jobs through undergrad, apply to medical school three times because the first two I could not afford to attend even with partial aid, defer twice, survive a residency that had me awake for stretches of time I still cannot fully reconstruct from memory. I stood in an operating room the first time at twenty-nine, assisting on a procedure that took four and a half hours, and I was so tired my vision had a slight shimmer at the edges. I thought about my grandmother's money exactly once during those four and a half hours. Then I put it away and focused.

I have been a practicing surgeon for eight years. I pay my loans on a schedule I mapped out on a spreadsheet in my first year of residency. I own my home. I have a husband who I met when I was thirty-two at a conference, who looked at me across a breakfast buffet and said, ""You have the eyes of someone who has been awake for thirty hours,"" and I said, ""Try forty-two,"" and that was more or less that.

My brother, in the meantime, dropped out of the business program in his second year. Got into sales. Got out of sales. Moved back home for a while. Moved in with a girlfriend. The girlfriend eventually asked him to leave. He had cycled through several situations that all had the same ending, and now he was in an apartment he could not sustain, and my mother had apparently decided that the natural solution was to call me.

She had not called me when she spent my money. She had just done it and presented it as a decision that had already been made.

So I sat across from her at my kitchen table, with coffee going cold between us, and I listened to her explain that he was family and that family helped each other, and that I was doing so well, surely this was nothing to me. Three hundred and forty dollars. Just for a few months until he found his footing.

I asked her one question. I said, ""Did you ever actually believe I would get here?""

She started to say something about how proud she was of me, and I stopped her. I said I didn't mean was she proud now. I meant back then, when she took the money. Did she believe, at any point, that I would actually become a doctor? Or did she think it was just something I said I wanted, the way kids say things?

She didn't answer. She looked at the table.

I said, ""Because if you had believed me, even a little bit, I don't think you would have made that call.""

She tried to pivot back to my brother. She said he needed help and she didn't know who else to ask. I told her that I understood she was in a difficult position, and that I was sorry he was struggling, and that my answer was no. Not because of the money, not because three hundred and forty dollars would change my life in any direction, but because I had spent twenty years building something without any help from her, and she had never once asked how I was doing it or whether I was okay, and I was not going to now become the family resource she reached for when something broke.

I told her that if she wanted to have a real conversation, a different kind of conversation, I was open to that. But that I was not a financial instrument, and I was not going to be treated like one just because I had made more of myself than she expected.

She left without finishing her coffee. She called me twice that week. I let both go to voicemail.

My brother texted me directly four days later. I didn't know she had given him my number or told him to try. He said he wasn't asking for much and that he hoped we could be adults about this. I responded once. I said that I wished him well and that I hoped he found stable ground, and that I was not in a position to help financially.

He did not respond to that.

My mother called a third time two weeks later. This time I picked up. She told me that she had realized, after thinking about it, that what she had said back then was wrong. The girls don't need degrees thing. She said she knew now that was a terrible thing to say and that she had been thinking about it.

I told her I appreciated that. And I meant it. But I also told her that recognition wasn't the same as repair, and that if she was hoping acknowledgment would move me to help my brother, she should know it didn't work that way. She started crying. I said I was sorry she was upset and that I had to go, and I hung up.

I have not spoken to her since. That was six weeks ago.

Here's what I keep coming back to, what I keep circling. I don't think I did anything wrong. I think I was calm and I was clear and I said what I actually meant without performing anything. But there is a version of this where my mother is an older woman who made a mistake under pressure twenty years ago and has spent two decades carrying it, and I have just refused her the one thing she was brave enough to ask for.

I don't know. Maybe I'm the butthole here. What do you think?

1r7f6dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnchartedMen/comments/1r7f6dp/how_to_stop_being_forgettable_6_psychologybacked/,How to Stop Being Forgettable: 6 Psychology-Backed Tricks That Actually Work,"Studied hundreds of dating profiles, read relationship research, watched way too many dating coaches. Here's what nobody wants to admit: physical attractiveness matters way less than you think. The #1 trait that makes men unattractive? Being forgettable. Having zero substance. Being a human beige wall.

I'm not talking about ""just be yourself"" BS. I'm talking about becoming someone who has genuine interests, opinions, and stories worth hearing. Most guys think they need abs or a jawline, but the real issue is they're just flat. No hobbies beyond gaming and Netflix. No strong opinions. No life outside work. Nothing that makes people think ""damn, I want to know this person better.""

The good news? This is 100% fixable. And honestly way easier than getting shredded or growing 3 inches taller.

## 1. Develop actual expertise in something

Pick literally anything that interests you and go deep. Could be coffee brewing, woodworking, obscure music genres, hiking trails, cooking one cuisine really well, whatever. The key is depth, not breadth. When you know your shit about something, you naturally become more engaging. You have stories. You have passion. You light up talking about it.

I started getting serious about specialty coffee after reading *The World Atlas of Coffee* by James Hoffmann. This book is INSANELY detailed, written by a World Barista Champion, and covers everything from farming to brewing. Made me realize how much depth exists in things I previously thought were simple. Now I have coffee gear, I visit roasters, I have opinions about Ethiopian naturals versus Colombian washed beans. Does everyone care? No. But the ones who do think it's cool as hell, and everyone else at least remembers me as ""coffee guy.""

## 2. Get comfortable having controversial opinions

Stop being so agreeable. I'm not saying be an asshole, but have actual stances on things and be willing to defend them. The most boring men are the ones who just nod along with whatever anyone says. Have taste. Have preferences. Be willing to say ""actually I think that movie was overrated"" or ""I don't get the hype around that restaurant.""

Research from social psychology shows people are more attracted to those with strong, authentic personalities, even if they don't agree with everything. Being polarizing is better than being neutral. At least people remember you.

## 3. Build a life that doesn't revolve around dating

This sounds backwards but it's real. When your entire existence is work, gym, trying to meet women, repeat, you become one dimensional. The most attractive people are the ones who are already living interesting lives that others want to be part of.

Join recreational sports leagues. Take improv classes. Volunteer somewhere. Start a side project. Go to meetups about topics you're curious about. Not to meet women, but to actually build a life worth living. The dating thing sorts itself out when you're genuinely engaged with life.

*The Charisma Myth* by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down perfectly. She's a Stanford lecturer who's coached everyone from tech executives to military leaders. The book explains how charisma isn't some genetic gift, it's learnable behaviors. One core principle? People are attracted to those who seem fully present and engaged with their own lives. Being desperate or overly available kills attraction instantly. This book genuinely changed how I show up in social situations.

## 4. Learn to tell better stories

Most people suck at storytelling. They either give you a boring play by play of events, or they're so vague nothing lands. Good storytelling has specific details, has a point, and doesn't drag on forever. It's a skill you can practice.

Next time something remotely interesting happens to you, practice retelling it. Cut the boring parts. Add sensory details. Find the humor or insight. Watch standup comedy and notice how comedians structure stories. They don't just relay facts, they craft narratives with setups and payoffs.

Try the Ash app for this, actually. It's an AI relationship coach that helps you practice social situations and conversations. Sounds weird but it's basically a judgment free space to workshop how you communicate. Helped me figure out which stories actually land versus which ones made people's eyes glaze over.

## 5. Develop emotional intelligence

Learn to read rooms. Notice when someone's uncomfortable or engaged. Ask good follow up questions. Remember details people share. Show genuine curiosity about others' lives. This matters more than almost anything physical.

*Emotional Intelligence 2.0* by Travis Bradberry is the definitive guide here. Backed by research from over 500,000 people. Comes with a self assessment code so you can actually measure where you're at. The core framework (self awareness, self management, social awareness, relationship management) sounds basic but the specific strategies are gold. Like how to actually manage stress in the moment, or how to read micro expressions. Made me realize I was way more oblivious to social cues than I thought.

If you want to go deeper on relationship psychology and social skills but struggle to get through dense books, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's a personalized learning app built by Columbia University alumni that pulls from dating experts, relationship research, and books like the ones mentioned above. You type in something like ""I'm an introvert who wants to be more magnetic in social situations,"" and it creates a tailored learning plan with audio lessons you can customize from quick 15-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. 

The voice options are surprisingly addictive, you can pick anything from a smooth, conversational tone to something more energetic depending on your mood. Since most listening happens during commutes or workouts, the flexibility helps. It also builds adaptive plans that evolve based on what resonates with you, so it's not just generic advice. Makes self-improvement feel less like homework and more like actual progress.

## 6. Stop consuming, start creating

Guys who only consume entertainment (scrolling, gaming, binging shows) have nothing interesting to say. Start making things. Doesn't matter what. Write, draw, make music, build furniture, start a blog about a weird topic you're into, film YouTube videos about your hobby.

Creation forces you to develop skills, gives you projects to discuss, makes you more interesting by default. Plus it builds confidence because you're actively improving at something rather than passively absorbing content.

For building creative habits, the Finch app is surprisingly helpful. It's a self care pet app that gamifies habit building. Sounds childish but it actually works for establishing daily creative practice. Set goals like ""write for 15 minutes"" or ""practice guitar"" and your little bird companion levels up with you.

Look, you don't need to become the most interesting man in the world overnight. But if you can hold a conversation beyond small talk, have genuine passions, and show up as someone with substance, you're already ahead of 80% of men. Physical attraction opens doors. Being interesting keeps people around.

The real question isn't ""how do I become more attractive?"" It's ""am I someone I would want to hang out with?"" If the answer is no, start there. Everything else follows.

You will need clean water at 0–3 ppm. This can be an RO system at home or store-bought water. Or a 4-liter distiller like Vevor and similar ones. Depending on the region, RO or a distiller can give water anywhere from 0 ppm to 20 ppm (roughly).

For example, my water is 220 ppm and in 4 hours the distiller cleans 4 liters of water and gives a residual 20 ppm. Then I pour this water into a ZeroWater pitcher and it gives me a reading of 1 ppm.

I also want to note that with this combo, distiller + ZeroWater, for exactly 1 year it has been giving me 1 ppm )) This is fantastic ) I don’t change membranes, I don’t buy water, and most importantly the distiller consumes about 4 kWh of electricity. In the end I save money everywhere and get a great cup of coffee )

It’s very important to aim for 0-1 ppm, because with every increase by 1 unit you may notice an unwanted taste in the coffee. For me it’s an association with sweaty socks and something very unpleasant )

3. Dropper bottles! There are different volumes, colors, and tip shapes. You can buy any size or use the ones you already have. The color also doesn’t matter, because they will be stored in the fridge and only there. The longest I stored concentrates was 2 months and nothing happened to them, I think you can store them longer. If you buy new ones, get amber glass, a round dropper (because it gives a more consistent drop), and any volume: 25, 50, 100 ml.

4. Scales. If you have a 0.01 g scale - great, it will work. Just not 0.1 g, we don’t need that kind of error. Don’t chase 0.001 g scales, because they are less convenient and that precision is overkill.

https://preview.redd.it/qbce4774t3kg1.jpg?width=1821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91d4abb97a7907f2eafe8375815be988adf96d6e

5. TDS meter. I don’t recommend very cheap ones, they are less accurate. Better to get a Xiaomi or a Milwaukee CD97 with manual calibration. If you already have a TDS meter, just use it, no worries.

6. Extra containers. If your minerals arrive in a plastic zip bag or a bag, it’s better to transfer them into a tight plastic container, because minerals absorb moisture and can spoil. This is the best option. Store in a dry place, away from the sun. Also, so you don’t keep the main container open all the time while measuring minerals, pour about 20 g into small containers. If you have supplement bottles, you can use those.

PROFIT! That’s it, now you’ve leveled up in making an awesome cup!

Additional. For better accuracy, you can weigh the drops (10 times) from your specific dropper, calculate the average value, and ask ChatGPT (or similar) to calculate more precisely how much dry concentrate you need. And in general, you can do any calculations. It’s a very convenient and useful tool.

On the Lotus Coffee website you can use the calculator and the recipe.

1r7f34p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r7f34p,The triplets moved? (98% sure),"This sub has been speculating that have or will move for months, and I believe they finally did. Sorry for the long analysis but my excuse is I’m nosy, and I got bored  on my day off and decided to look into it after all the discussion on Matt’s Tiktok & the Friday video post.

Here’s why I think it’s legit now (in order from least convincing points to most):

1.	⁠We haven’t seen any part of their house over half a year ago, other than a contained area of the kitchen, the staircase, and very close-ups of the TV, or Chris’s couch.

2.	⁠They needed to move because they were being stalked by fans and doxxed, their house was shared and reposted on Tiktok a few times (more on this topic later). Chris’s room was in a really unsafe area because it was easily accessed from the outside, on tour he told a story about someone leaving a Pepsi rock outside his door 💀 plus, their relationship with Laura has soured (who lives literally down the street from them allegedly) and it kind of sucked for them that they still live that close to her.

3.	⁠They “broke” their usual kitchen table (on purpose, they were planning on doing it for the video) and Matt kind of slipped up and referred to it as “the table \*here\*” when being a soft cookie about it breaking. There’s no real reason for them to do that unless they want to get a new one and planned to move. Also in the Zillow video, they were kind of talking about things they’d like in a new house, same with the “Come Eat With Us In Texas” video, Matt was talking about what he wanted to decorate their “next house” so it kinda confirms they were discussing plans to look for a new house to move into after tour.

4.	⁠The emptiness of the kitchen area (no utensils, coffee machine, utensils) counters, side table, the new blackout curtains. Someone pointed out the oven and microwave aren’t turned on or working either in the new video (you can tell because it’s flashing the time).

5.	⁠The new house they’re filming in might just be their own, this is mostly just a theory, but I’ll attach some photos to show the comparison. The house that they pre-filmed videos back in November is the same house in the new “Which Triplet Is Most Athletic?” video. At the beginning their hair is wet and it’s from when they first woke up, like they showered there, then at the end they’re back at the same house and Nick does a cold plunge, but why would do it it anywhere other than his home if he had to shower and change afterward? Also the wood detailing in the house from the Guessing Women’s Products video is the same as the other two.  At first when I watched that video I had thought it was an AirBnB, or maybe their team’s house, but why would you shower any place other than your own? Or why would they keep renting the same location multiple times? This one I’m less sure about, I do think the photos in the background of the first video were weird but it might’ve just been filmed from when the new house was being staged for purchasing and they hadn’t moved into it yet. (From Matt’s Tiktok and stories of the TV plus the accidental Doordash dox we know they hadn’t moved out at all at the end of January or first week of February).

6.	⁠Now, Matt’s Tiktok in the bathroom is an entirely new bathroom. Again I attached some photos of their previous showers and how different it looks (different sliding glass doors, shower head, drawers, tiles, and a window behind it, plus the door is in a new place).

7.	⁠Because it was common knowledge where they lived based on people sharing their address on Tiktok, Laura posting her address (and them living near her) plus Nick  accidentally showing their location in the Uber surprise vlog, anyone who knows their location can check now and see they put the townhouse up for rent again officially as of a few weeks ago. Will NOT be posting or sharing this for obvious privacy reasons but it does confirm they no longer live there full-time. The last video might’ve been some weird form of a goodbye from them without outright saying it, they probably don’t want to share further information after what happened to their last house.

8.	⁠The mod of this subreddit had mentioned a month-ish ago that they were linked to a new house months ago but just never moved into it. Not sure how true that is but it’s another thing to consider.

If any of this is too identifying just let me know and I can modify the post, but I tried to avoid sharing details! We’ve all been wondering if they’ll move for over a year now and I decided to detective it myself 🫡",5,1771354488.0,Sturniolotripletsnark,17,0.73,False

The real patterns of infidelity are way more nuanced than lipstick on a collar or sneaking phone calls. Most people focus on obvious red flags but miss the subtle behavioral shifts that actually matter.

This isn't about becoming paranoid or playing detective. It's about understanding human psychology and recognizing when something fundamental has changed in your relationship dynamic. After analyzing hundreds of cases and expert insights, these are the patterns that consistently emerge before anyone discovers explicit evidence.

**The sudden shift in conflict patterns.** When someone's checking out emotionally, arguments either disappear completely or escalate weirdly fast over nothing. Psychologist Esther Perel talks about this in her book *The State of Affairs* (won multiple awards, she's literally THE expert on infidelity and modern relationships, been featured everywhere from TED to the NYT). She explains how guilty partners often become conflict avoidant because they've mentally already left, or conversely pick fights to justify their behavior. This book completely changed how I understood betrayal. It's not a manual for catching cheaters but rather an insanely good read about why people stray and what it reveals about relationships. The chapter on emotional ambiguity will make you question everything you think you know about monogamy.

**They stop sharing mundane details.** Healthy couples have boring conversations. ""My boss was annoying today"" or ""the coffee machine broke again"" might sound trivial but it's actually relationship glue. When someone starts editing their day significantly or gives you the highlight reel version only, something shifted. Dr. John Gottman's research (he can predict divorce with 90% accuracy, wild) shows that these small daily exchanges create intimacy. His work demonstrates that emotional distance starts way before physical cheating.

**Sudden enthusiasm for self improvement.** New gym routine out of nowhere, completely different style choices, fresh interest in grooming. Obviously people can just decide to better themselves but when it's abrupt and unexplained, especially combined with other signs, it often indicates they're trying to impress someone. The timing matters more than the action itself.

**Their phone habits normalize in a weird way.** Everyone talks about how cheaters suddenly guard their phones obsessively. True, but the smarter ones overcorrect. They'll leave their phone face up constantly, hand it to you casually, make a show of having nothing to hide. It's psychological theater. Meanwhile they've set up alternative communication methods or simply memorized to delete everything immediately.

If you want to go deeper on relationship psychology but don't have the energy to read dense research or multiple books, there's an app called BeFreed that's been pretty useful. It's a personalized learning app that pulls from relationship psychology books, therapist insights, and research papers to create custom audio lessons. You can type something like ""understanding infidelity patterns as someone in a long-term relationship"" and it generates a learning plan just for you, drawing from sources like Esther Perel's work, attachment theory research, and real therapist case studies. You can choose between quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. The depth control makes complex psychology actually digestible during commutes or gym time.

**Projection and deflection.** Therapist Shirley Glass wrote *Not Just Friends* (considered the bible on emotional affairs and infidelity recovery), and she documents how cheaters often accuse their partners of suspicious behavior. It's textbook projection. They're hyperfocused on betrayal because they're actively betraying you, so they assume you might be doing the same. This manifests as sudden jealousy, weird questions about your whereabouts, accusations that come from nowhere. The book is legitimately the best resource for understanding how affairs develop and what actual warning signs look like versus paranoid thinking.

**Changed intimacy patterns without explanation.** This goes both ways. Either they suddenly want way more sex (guilt can increase desire weirdly, or they're getting ideas elsewhere they want to try) or they completely lose interest. What matters is the shift being unexplained and significant. Sex therapist Ian Kerner discusses in multiple podcasts how affair fog affects bedroom dynamics in established relationships.

**They create elaborate explanations for simple things.** When someone's lying, they often over explain. You ask why they're late and instead of ""traffic was bad"" you get a five minute story with unnecessary details about construction and detours and their coworker's car trouble. It's cognitive overload, they're working too hard to seem truthful. Meanwhile honest people often under explain because they don't feel defensive.

**Your gut keeps screaming.** This sounds unscientific but your subconscious picks up on microexpressions, tonal shifts, behavioral patterns that your conscious mind hasn't fully processed yet. Gavin de Becker's *The Gift of Fear* explores how human intuition actually works and why we should trust those instincts more. Obviously don't let anxiety spiral into baseless accusations, but if something feels off and you keep dismissing it, that discomfort might be data worth examining.

**Emotional withdrawal disguised as independence.** They stop asking for your opinion, stop including you in decisions, create more separate friend groups and activities. Healthy autonomy is great, but when someone systematically removes you from their inner world, they're often making space for someone else. The shift feels less like growth and more like erasure.

The tricky thing about subtle signs is that individually they mean nothing. Anyone can have a stressful week, get into fitness, or be distracted. It's the cluster of changes happening simultaneously without reasonable explanation that creates the actual pattern. Most people discovered infidelity not through finding explicit evidence but through trusting that fundamental shift they kept feeling but couldn't quite name.

The deeper issue isn't even about catching someone. It's about whether you're in a relationship where you feel secure, valued, and connected. If you're constantly monitoring for signs of betrayal, something's already broken whether infidelity exists or not. That underlying trust erosion does just as much damage.",1,1771354479.0,TheMindSpace,0,1.0,False

Wake up at 5. Cold shower. Journal. Meditate. Drink water like I’m in a wellness ad. I tried all of it. None of it stuck. Most days I just felt behind before the day even started.

What finally worked for me is way less impressive, but way more real. And somehow, it saved me almost a full hour every morning.

**1. No phone for the first 30 minutes**

This one hurt my soul at first. I used to grab my phone the second I woke up and “just check” things… which quietly turned into 20–30 minutes of scrolling. Now my phone sleeps in the next room and I use a basic alarm clock. Mornings feel calmer, my brain feels less scrambled, and I actually get out of bed faster instead of melting into the mattress.

**2. I killed tiny morning decisions**

I didn’t realize how much time I wasted thinking about small stuff. What to wear, what to eat, what to pack, whether I *feel like* doing something. Now I run on defaults. Same easy breakfast most days, clothes picked the night before, bag ready by the door. Zero drama, zero dithering, and surprisingly less mental fatigue.

**3. Timers keep me from drifting**

I noticed I’d randomly lose time doing basic things. Brushing teeth would become staring into space. Making coffee would turn into wandering around. Now I set short timers for transitions (5 minutes, nothing intense). It sounds silly, but it keeps me moving instead of floating.

**4. One tiny win before anything else**

I stopped opening email first thing. That alone changed my mood. Instead, I do one small, clear task (5 minutes max) like clearing my desk, reviewing my top 3 priorities, or setting up my workspace. It gives me a sense of control instead of instantly reacting to everyone else’s chaos.

I used to need almost 2 hours to “fully start” my day. Now it takes about 1. That extra hour goes into quiet, focused work before distractions begin, and mentally it feels like I’m leading the day instead of chasing it.

It’s not aesthetic. It’s not impressive. But it works for me.

The only reason why we see each other is because I drive them around for work related reasons. My cousin is her let's say ""Personal Trainer."" Whenever we're together in the car, I would stay silent and barely talked kasi mahiyain ako and medyo overthinker din at takot na baka mali masabi ko or baka di nakakatawa. Si Crush naman would talk to my cousin or to her colleagues who she's with along in the car ride. That's how I fell in love with her personality kasi similar kami. 

I really want to ask her out. I even wanted to buy her a gift on her birthday last November and give it to her personally pero naudlot kasi nagkasakit ako. 

I feel that we may have a connection kasi I think she is comfortable with me na. Nag stop over kami sa Pick Up Coffee and kami ng pinsan ko bumaba kami ng car to get the orders. I left my phone in the car kasi naka connect sya sa bluetooth so that they could listen to music while waiting. Then later I found out she used the camera to take a funny selfie and a video greet. Medyo kinilig nga ako nung nakita ko un eh. Which makes me wonder, does she like me too? 

By the way, sobrang mahiyan talaga ako. I'm usually the guy who would make funny and sarcastic jokes just like Chandler sa Friends and minsan kalog din like Joey. Pero di ko maipakita ung true side ko na un kasi nga mahiyain at takot din. 

I also know that she is out of my league kasi maganda talaga sya at kilala din sya. But I really want to pursue her in a serious relationship and take care of her. 

What should I do? How can I tell that she would like me too?

Hey Reddit, Kodiak here.

January hits, and suddenly protein is everywhere; bars, drinks, coffee, chips! And yes, protein matters. But the real MVP? Fiber, quietly doing a lot of the behind-the-scenes work, and most of us ([95%](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2022/01/27/sound-the-fiber-alarm-most-of-us-need-more-of-it-in-our-diet)!) aren’t getting nearly enough. That’s where Kodiak stands out, we bring the protein, sure, but we also pack in whole grains that contain fiber to help keep you fueled, full, and satisfied.

Let’s give breakfast’s unsung hero some credit. Whole grains and fiber do more than fill your stomach, they support your gut too.

# Fiber: the quiet MVP of your morning

**TL;DR:** Fiber helps support digestion, fullness, steady energy, and gut health.

Fiber comes from whole plant foods, think fruit, veggies, beans, and whole grains like oats, and it plays a huge role in how your body functions day to day. Fiber helps slow digestion, supports regularity, feeds beneficial gut bacteria, and contributes to increased satiety (aka: staying full longer).

Most people fall short on fiber, especially at breakfast. Starting your day with whole grains is one of the simplest ways to close that gap

# Why 100% whole grains matter

**TL;DR:** All grains aren’t created equal.

Whole grains keep the bran, germ, and endosperm intact. That’s where the majority of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and slow-digesting carbs live. Refined grains strip the bran, germ and the majority of those beneficial nutrients away.

At Kodiak, our oatmeal is made with **100% whole grain oats**, providing fiber that supports digestion and helps deliver steadier, more sustained energy, whether you’re heading into a workout, a long meeting, or a full day with your wild ones.

# Fiber & protein for fullness

**TL;DR:** Better together.

Everyone talks about protein when it comes to energy. And yes, protein matters, but it’s only part of the picture.

Fiber does something different. Fiber from whole grains digests more slowly, which helps carbs enter the bloodstream at a steadier pace. Translation: fewer spikes, fewer crashes, and more consistent energy.

Protein, meanwhile, helps you stay full and supports muscle repair. It [influences appetite hormones](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7539343/) and provides amino acids your body uses to maintain and recover muscle, which is why meals with enough protein tend to keep people satisfied longer and less likely to hit a hunger-driven slump mid-morning.

Put fiber-rich carbs, like whole grains, and protein on the same plate, and you’re following eating patterns consistently linked to steadier energy, better focus, and physical performance.

# Meet the Kodiak oats lineup

TL;DR: Because good intentions only work if breakfast does.

A lot of well-intentioned New Year goals don’t fall apart because motivation disappears, they fall apart because mornings get real when life shows up. The plans that last are the ones simple enough to repeat even on your most chaotic days.

That’s why every Kodiak oatmeal option starts with the same non-negotiables: 100% whole grains for fiber, protein to support fullness, and simple prep that doesn’t require a full day of planning or a reset every Monday.

Reason is that i feel like romance isn't realistically displayed due to the partner permanently texting, showing up or being around. They don't seem to have a life of their own which makes it suffocating sometimes. As example, my character entered a relationship with an NPC which she knew all her life. He's best friends with her brother but also the brother of her best friend. It wasn't some meet-cute rom-com type of thing but filled with anxiety, fears, being scared and so on on both sides due to them knowing each other basically all their life. They never were friends in particular but due to the families being close friends and the friendship between characters around me they simply were part of the same friend circle and often around each other. So no hanging out and stuff without others from the group and no prior tension on my characters side. He did have feelings for a while tho. Anyways, now they had a lunch date which was mainly a lot of talking and figuring things out and talking about fears each has regarding things going south. But since they had the history they had they decided, after another date which was, once again, hours of talking, that they do want to try but go slow and take their time.

Now to my problem:

I can't do anything without the NPC texting, showing up, being pushed into scenes for no obvious reason and all that. He's permanently around, bringing coffee, wanting to make meals for my character, hang out and do things. It's as if the AI completely ignores that he has a part-time job and goes to college or that he also has interests and other friends instead of being hyper focused on my character. Example is that he told my character to rest since the last months had been a lot of stress due to my characters brother getting married and me helping out full-time. But when i do lay down to rest as he said i have in the next output that he texts asking if i'm still awake and that he misses me or that he knocks on my door / rings the bell. I deleted it and moved on and again the same...

So... is there any way so the AI isn't as suffocating when displaying romance and relationships?",4,1771354175.0,AIDungeon,6,1.0,False

He knows that and most of the time we get along fine. I never use it as an excuse for anything and franky I feel very uncomfortable when it's brought up because I hate labels.

Today my father (55M) took me (20M) to a psychiatrist appointment because he wanted to have a in-person conversation about my medicine. We usually do it virtually but today he was off (which is rare because he usually works 65+ hours a week) and I had just gotten off of a horrible antipsychotic which made me miserable. Before we left, I asked him multiple times if we had anything to do after it was over and he said no consistently. The appointment went perfectly fine and we even laughed and joked about stuff. 

But after it was over, he started saying that he wanted to go to this new chicken restaurant that had just opened. Problem is, it's in the opposite direction from the psychiatrist's office and it's already a 50 minute drive back home. I started getting a little upset (because he does this a lot, wanting to change plans after agreeing that they're set in stone). I asked if we could make a compromise and just get a cup of coffee instead on the way home and then he went on this long rant about how I don't appreciate anything he does and that he busts his ass at his work just for me to rob him of quality time together. I didn't argue after that - I simply said ""I apologize"" and he decided to just take me home without doing anything at all.

I know what I did was rude but I can't fucking stand how he pulls this bait-and-switch shit at the last minute. If he had just told me he wanted to get food from the get-go I would've had time to mentally prepare myself. I feel horrible too because everything about him working hard is absolutely true - he's literally driving all the way from DFW to southern Kansas tonight as an opportunity to make extra money. I'm doing well in my college classes and have been far happier after getting off the medication and he's noticed that but I just don't know how to handle this.",3,1771354164.0,AITAH,15,1.0,False
1r7exad,https://i.redd.it/a45636p7p3kg1.png,Why Choosing a Local Lender Can Make or Break Your Mortgage Experience,"Buying a home is one of the biggest financial moves most of us ever make. But here’s a truth a lot of buyers learn the hard way: the lender you choose matters just as much as the house you buy.

Let’s talk about why working with a *local lender*—not some corporate bank five states away—can make all the difference in your mortgage experience.

# 🏡 1. Local Knowledge = Real Accuracy

A *local lender* actually knows your market. They understand the neighborhood values, seasonal market shifts, and even the quirks of certain areas that can affect appraisals.

For example, a local lender in North Idaho knows that the value of a lakefront cabin near Sandpoint isn’t comparable to one ten miles inland—even if the square footage matches. That area familiarity leads to faster, fairer appraisals and fewer last-minute surprises in underwriting.

# 📍 2. Local Appraisers Keep You Grounded

Corporate lenders often outsource appraisals to people who’ve never set foot in the area. That’s how you end up with a valuation that’s off by tens of thousands of dollars.

Local lenders work with trusted local appraisers, the people who actually drive your street, see your home’s view, and understand what makes your neighborhood special. That real-world context protects your investment and saves you time, money, and stress.

# 🤝 3. You’re a Person, Not a File Number

Big corporate lenders see thousands of applications a day. To them, you’re just another loan ID in a spreadsheet.

Local lenders live in your community. They shop where you shop, their kids might go to school with yours, and they actually *care* about building trust. That often means faster communication, personalized loan options, and genuine accountability. They succeed when your community succeeds.

# 💬 4. Relationships Over Transactions

When you choose a local lender, you’re starting a long-term relationship—not just checking a box on a to-do list. Many buyers end up referring friends or coming back years later to refinance, and those local lenders remember your story, your goals, and your journey.

In short: a local lender sees your mortgage as a milestone, not a transaction.

# 🚀 5. Supporting Local Strengthens Your Community

Every time you choose local—whether it’s coffee, contractors, or your mortgage—you’re helping build a stronger local economy. Your dollars stay in your community, supporting jobs and services right here at home.

# Final Thought

If you’re buying a home, refinancing, or just exploring what’s possible in today’s market, take the time to talk to a local lender first.  
You’ll likely get better advice, a smoother process, and peace of mind knowing you’re working with someone who understands *your* community, not just your credit score.

I settled into my old gaming chair, watching the sunrise paint the walls in shades of gold and orange. The irony wasn't lost on me. I'd spent most of my living years avoiding mornings, and now I was literally weakened by daylight.

Miles stirred on the couch, mumbling something about ""ghost politics"" and ""retail therapy.""

I decided to let him sleep. After everything that had happened, he'd earned a few hours of peace before diving back into the supernatural clusterfuck that was apparently my new existence.

I spent the morning exploring the limits of my domain, testing how my enhanced abilities worked within the house. In the kitchen, I could manipulate the coffee maker with barely any MP cost. I could sense every pipe, every wire, even the foundation itself. It was like having a sixth sense for home improvement, which would have been useful when I was alive and the upstairs toilet kept leaking.

**\[ALERT: PARASITIC ENTITY DETECTED IN DOMAIN\]**  
**\[WARNING: MP DRAIN ACTIVE IN ZONE: HALLWAY\]**  
**\[NEW THREAT: SPIRIT LEECH x3\]**

I blinked. And the world tilted.

Suddenly I wasn’t hovering over my gaming chair high up. Disembodied. Looking down on the house from a ghost’s-eye view like I’d slipped into some haunted SimCity knockoff.

Miles was labeled with little zzz’s over his head.

Then I saw them.

**\[ENEMIES SPAWNED: SPIRIT LEECHES x3\]**  
**\[OBJECTIVE: DEFEND CORE STRUCTURES\]**  
**\[RESOURCES: EP: 12 | SALT TRAPS: 1 | POLTERGEIST CHARGE: 1 | Ectoplasm Slimes: UNAVAILABLE\]**

Three translucent slugs the size of housecats were slithering through my hallway, leaving trails of what looked like digital static. They pulsed with a sickly green light, and I could feel them draining my MP just by existing in my space.

""What the hell?"" I muttered, watching my energy bar tick down from 85 to 82 to 79. Each second they spent in my domain was costing me.

I tried to drop out of the tactical view, but the interface seemed stuck in tower defense mode. A sidebar appeared with defensive options:

**\[DEPLOY SALT TRAP: 5 EP\]**

**\[POLTERGEIST CHARGE: 8 EP\]**

A targeting reticle appeared over the hallway. I placed it right in front of the leeches. A circle of what looked like pixelated salt materialized on the floor, glowing faintly.

The first leech hit the trap and immediately began convulsing, its form crackling. The second one stopped just short of the circle, its eyeless head weaving back and forth like it was trying to figure out what had happened to its buddy.

**\[SPIRIT LEECH NEUTRALIZED: 1/3\]**

The third leech had taken a different route, somehow bypassing my salt trap entirely and heading straight for the living room where Miles was still sleeping. I watched in horror as it approached the couch, its form pulsing brighter as it sensed living energy.

**\[WARNING: CRITICAL THREAT: LIFE DRAIN IMMINENT\]**

""Oh, hell no,"" I growled, selecting the Poltergeist option and targeting the area around Miles.

The effect was immediate and chaotic. Every loose object in the living room magazines, empty energy drink cans, TV remotes suddenly launched themselves at the leech with supernatural velocity. The creature let out a sound like feedback through a broken speaker as it was pelted with debris.

**\[SPIRIT LEECH NEUTRALIZED: 2/3\]**

Miles jolted awake, sitting up just as my coffee table's stack of old gaming magazines exploded around him.

""What the fuck?!"" he yelled, ducking as a Red Bull can sailed over his head.

I tried to drop out of the tactical view to explain what was happening, but the interface kept me locked in defense mode. The remaining leech had circled back toward the hallway, apparently learning from its fallen comrades’ mistakes. It moved in erratic patterns, avoiding the salt trap while steadily draining my MP.

**\[MP: 72/100 AND FALLING\]**

""Lex!"" Miles scrambled off the couch, looking around wildly. ""What's happening? Are we under attack?""

I focused on the living room speakers, managing to push my voice through despite the system's tactical lock. ""Spirit leeches! Three of them! I got two but there's one left and it's draining my energy!""

""Spirit what now?"" Miles grabbed a baseball bat from behind the door, wielding it like he was about to face down a home invader. ""Where are they?""

""They're like ghost parasites! One's heading for the second floor!""

Miles squinted at the empty hallway. ""I don't see anything!""

The leech had reached the bottom of the stairs and was beginning to climb, its slug-like form leaving trails on each step. My MP continued to drop: 68, 65, 62. At this rate, I'd be completely drained in less than two minutes.

The leech was halfway up the stairs now, its form more solid and threatening than I'd expected.

I watched my MP drain further as the leech climbed higher, its form getting more solid with each step. Panic crept into my spectral consciousness as I realized I was running out of options.

""Miles! I need you to do something!"" I shouted through the speakers, causing them to crackle with feedback. ""Go to the kitchen and grab the salt!""

""Salt? Why salt?"" Miles called back, but he was already moving, bat still clutched in his hands.

""It's like a ghost repellent! Hurry!""

I watched through my domain sense as Miles rummaged through the kitchen cabinets, cursing under his breath. The leech had reached the top of the stairs and was heading toward my old gaming room, drawn by the Memory Anchor I'd installed earlier.

**\[MP: 58/100 AND FALLING\]**

""Found it!"" Miles emerged from the kitchen with a container of table salt, looking like he was about to attempt some kind of supernatural cooking show.

""Second floor! Top of the stairs!"" I directed him, trying to keep the panic out of my voice. ""Just throw it at the thing!""

Miles took the stairs two at a time, breathing heavily. As he reached the landing, he stopped and squinted at the hallway.

""I still don't see anything, man!""

The leech was directly in front of him, maybe three feet away, its form pulsing with stolen energy. I could feel my connection to the house starting to weaken as my MP dropped below 50.

""It's right in front of you! Just throw the salt!""

Miles looked confused but raised the container anyway. ""Where exactly?""

""Three feet ahead! About knee height!""

He upended the salt container, creating a white cascade that fell directly onto the leech. The effect was immediate and dramatic. The creature let out a shriek that sounded like a modem, its form dissolving into wisps of green smoke.

**\[SPIRIT LEECH NEUTRALIZED: 3/3\]**

**\[DOMAIN DEFENSE SUCCESSFUL\]**

**\[XP GAINED: 75\]**

**\[MP REGENERATION RESTORED\]**

The tactical view finally released its grip on my consciousness, and I snapped back to my normal perspective. I was floating in the hallway, watching salt slowly settle on the carpet.

""Did I get it?"" he asked, still holding the empty salt container.

""Yeah, you got it."" I felt my MP slowly beginning to regenerate now that the parasites were gone. ""Thanks, man. That was way too close.""

Miles slumped against the wall, his adrenaline clearly wearing off. ""Spirit leeches. Of course there are spirit leeches. Why wouldn't there be spirit leeches?""

""Apparently, they're attracted to new domains,"" I said, reading a notification that had just appeared. ""Common problem for ghosts who don't know how to properly ward their territory.""

""So this is gonna keep happening?""

I studied the interface, noting several new defensive options that had unlocked after successfully repelling the attack. ""Not if I upgrade the defenses. But that's gonna cost EP, and I'm basically broke.""

Miles sat down on the stairs, running his hands through his hair. ""Okay, so we need to figure out how to make ghost money. Great. My dead best friend needs a job.""

""Actually,"" I said, remembering something from my earlier conversation with Ethel, ""I think I know someone who might be hiring.""

""First, coffee,"" Miles said, heading for the kitchen. ""Then we figure out how to turn your house into a proper haunted fortress. And then,"" he paused, looking back at me with a grin that was equal parts terrified and excited, ""we go find this Wraith Queen and see what she's all about.""

I followed him to the kitchen, already feeling my energy starting to regenerate within my domain.

""You know what the weirdest part is?"" Miles said, starting the coffee maker. ""I'm actually looking forward to seeing what happens next.""

""That makes two of us,"" I replied, and for the first time since choking on that chicken nugget, I felt genuinely excited about being dead.

1r7eqv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r7eqv2/hr_the_wraith/,[HR] The Wraith,"They were all there that night. It was Rob Andrews, Steve Borgan, Dwight Fairfield, and Megan Thomas. They were at Braleington Cemetery in Riverdale. They were in their early twenties and they decided that they would walk through the streets of town and then that they would walk through the cemetery at night. And why not? They were young and they decided to go on a little adventure. It was a moderately cold night that night and the moonlight illuminated some of the area. They walked along the pathway through the area.

“So anyway, I drunk four beers that night and I started seeing the shit. I thought that I saw some woman crossing the street. She looked like a damned ghost,” Rob Andrews said. He was the leader of the group as they walked along the path. He had a beer bottle in his hand and the golden liquid jostled some as they walked.

“So what did she look like? Was she transparent or something? You know, like a ghost?” Steve Borgan asked.

“She looked like she was transparent. She crossed the street and she got about halfway across it and then she just faded away and then she was gone,” Rob said.

“Humm. And that wasn't even a ghost. I am disappointed,” Steve said.

“Yeah. Moral of the story is don't drink sometimes, or don't drunk too much,” Rob said.

“So that's it? No ghost? Well, I had two beers,” Dwight said.

“Come on, Dwight. You should drink more than that,” Rob said and he lifted the bottle of Corona Premier to his mouth and he took a drink. There was a cheeky smile on his face. He was a hypocrite with his moral stories.

“Well, I have never seen anything, except that gas prices kept going up,” Steve said and he looked ahead and took some steps forward.

“Oh. Well, there is a story of a ghost around here. In this cemetery,” Rob said.

“Oh, come on. No way,” Steve said doubtfully.

“Yeah. It is a true story,” Rob said.

“What is the story?” Dwight asked. He was curious.

“There was a man named Ace Weathers in this town teen years ago. He was bullied in school and instead of dealing with it the right way and getting the principal involved, he had beaten the bully with a hammer. He had nearly killed him, but he recovered. Since then, he was known as Ace The Mace. Some years later, he had killed two men in town with a hammer. He had apparently escaped the cops and no arrests were made,” Rob said.

“Woah, really? What happened then?” Dwight asked.

“Well, then four years later, something awful had happened. Ace had gotten a job at a place called Haven Wreckers. That is a place that people go to to get their cars smashed for some money. Anyway, there was a guy working there and he was walking away from one of the cars, but he had forgotten his wallet in the car. He had gotten inside it and he searched or it. Then people think that on of the works had accidentally pressed a button and the guy had gotten smashed in the car and he died. The place closed down, but the cars are still there. Some people say that you can still see his ghost in that car. Eddie Winters said that he saw him. That was some years ago now. Maybe he had gone out that night on a dare, or maybe he had felt tough. He told Mathew who then told me that he had snuck out of this parent's house when he was seventeen. He had walked through town by himself and he made his way to Haven Wreckers. He walked through the place with the wrecked cars. He said that he had made it to the spot and he had just stood there. There was the crumpled and mangled ghost of the man in the car in the moonlight. Eddie said that the ghost of the man looked like he was sort of like a glowing blue and the expression on his face appeared to show that he was screaming. It was as if he had never truly escaped. And Eddie said that he could faintly hear the man screaming, though the sound didn't seem to be coming from anywhere. Some people in town say that you can still hear him screaming in the area. Anyway, Eddie said that after seeing that that he had ran home. That is the story of the ghost at Haven Wreckers,” Rob said.

“What about that Ace guy?” Dwight asked.

“Well, that is what I was getting to. There were some years that had passed and a few more people had died. Ace had killed them with an axe, or people had thought that the had done it. Then he had been gunned down one night by a cop in an altercation out on Harllow Street. This sounds totally crazy, but somebody had made up a story or that the story had gotten around town that Ace had only half died and he turned into a half man and a half ghost, and that he had kept on killing. He wore brown clothes, a wooden mask with green stripes of paint on it, he had an axe that had a handle made out of the spine of one of his victims, and he also held a small bell. He haunts this cemetery,” Rob said.

“A bell? What was that used for?” Steve asked.

“He would tap the axe blade against the bell and it would ring, and then he would turn invisible. He would tap it again and then he would reappear right before he was ready to strike at another one of his victims,” Rob said as they walked.

“Woah, that is strange,” Steve said.

“Wait, what was with all the crazy ghost stuff? How did that happen?” Dwight asked.

“I don't know. Maybe had been involved in the occult or something. Who knows,” Rob said and then he slowed down and stopped. “Well, this is the place.” He looked around a little.

“Oh, come on.” Meg said. “That is just a ghost story. Yeah, some psycho was around, but he was dealt with and he is gone now. There is nothing here.”

“Yeah, probably,” Rob agreed.

The group had stopped walking and they stood there in the cemetery at night. Dwight looked around. There was the dark grass, the pathways going in different directions, the many headstones, and the moon in the sky. To him, it had seemed quiet. Almost took quiet. “Oh well,” he said.

“What's up?” Steve asked Dwight. If something was bothering him, then he wanted to know.

“Nothing. It is just a little spooky now. That's all,” Dwight said he slowly looked around in the darkness.

“Oh, come on. That was just a story,” Meg said to him. She had hoped that that would lighten the mood, but she saw that by the expression on Dwight's face that it had not. “Wait. What is it?” she asked him.

“I don't know,” Dwight said. He looked scared. Terrified was the right word. He seemed to look around the place, as if he was almost supposed to expect some figure to jump around some unseen corner at him. It wasn't because of the ghost story, though. To Dwight, it had been something different. He couldn't place it, though.

“Well, I feel fine. Probably because I am already drunk,” Ron said and he laughed a little. He worked at an Oriellys store and he was a tough guy.

“Yeah, that's you,” Meg said.

“The place seems fine to me,” Rob said to the group, but it was also to himself.

Steve Borgan looked at Ron.

The man seemed as if thoughts were running through his mind. *It got to you too,* he thought.

“I'm good now. I just got the spooks for a moment. Let's keep walking, I guess,” Dwight said. He forced the words out. He didn't want his friends to see that he was worried.

“Yeah,” Ron agreed and he started to talk forward.

The group of friends walked along the paved trail. They walked and calmed down. Steve seemed fine and Dwight's nerves were getting back to normal. Why had he been so scared? He didn't know. It was because of something. He didn't know what it was. It was just under the tip of his tongue.

Suddenly, he saw a flashlight beam move across the dark grass and brighten it up. He saw that Ron was there and he was moving it back and forth, as if he was searching for something. *At least it wasn't the groundskeeper,* he thought to himself. He walked with the group.

“Did you see something?” Steve asked Ron.

“Na. I just don't want to trip over anything.” The big man moved the flashlight back and forth.

“Right. Can't have that happen,” Meg said with a smile.

“Hey, did it get darker out here?” Ron asked. It was a genuine question.

“Yeah. It did,” Steve said and then he had a puzzled expression on his face. What time was it? It was nearly midnight.

They took some steps forward and then Ron saw something in the corner of his eye dart across a passage of grass behind him and vanish behind a large headstone. He exhaled in fear and turned around and shined his flashlight in that direction. There was nothing there. It was just the grass and the headstones.

“What was that?” he said, not really aware that his friend's had heard him.

“I don't know. I didn't see anything,” Steve said.

“Yeah... yeah. “Let's keep going,” Ron said to him. *Stupid adventure,* he thought. *I just wanted to have a little fun tonight. Now I am seeing the shit. I should have listened to Grandma June. I drunk* *too much and now I am seeing the shit*. *Just like that one time when I was driving home drunk and I* *thought that I saw a damned wolf on my street and I swerved the car and I hit one of the* neighbor's mailboxes. *Or that time that I had ran a red light and almost hit that woman in the street. I need to stop drinking.*

A hand clapped down on Ron's shoulder and he looked over. It was Steve. “You doing alright?” he asked him.

“Ye... yeah. I'm good,” he told Steve.

Steve slowly nodded and the group walked along the grass now. Dwight looked up at the night sky. The moon was partially behind some clouds now. Well, now he realized why it had gotten darker. He looked back down again and followed the group.

Ron had taken some steps along the grass and then he saw another shadow dart by off to the side behind him. He turned around sharply and shined his flashlight at the fleeting apparition. “What was that!?” he called out. The expression of fear was on his face.

Steve and the others looked over in that direction. There was nothing . There was just the dark grass and the headstones. Now there was a soft wind. Now there was something. He couldn't place it in his mind. Something was happening now.

Dwight looked around. His head darted around like a bird. *Shouldn't of come here,* he thought. *I shouldn't of done a lot of things., I made a lot of good decisions, but holy shit, this was dumb. Coming to a cemetery at night when there is a real Doddamn ghost here. I didn't know. No, I knew. Shit, this is bad. I shouldn't of done this. Like that time when I walked across Penob Street and that damned Saint Bernard chased me when I was ten. Or that time that I tried to sneak through the house and get some cookies out of gramma's cookie jar. Or that time when I snuck out of the house to go see my girlfriend Haylie and her cousin Ted beat me up and broke my glasses. He broke my glasses and I had to get a new pair after that. There was that time that I had snuck into the movie theater with some friends and I got caught. Well, we are in this situation now. Shit, what are we going to do? Alright, I am going to play it cool.* Dwight kept his guard up and he walked slowly with the group.

Ron was up ahead of them, being the leader. He seemed to naturally be leading the way. He thought that they should just head back. He looked around and saw the walkway that they had traveled on before. They had just been jolly and in a good mood before, but now they seemed to be little more than frightened school children. “Just the spooks,” he said to himself without realizing it. Yeah well, not avoiding “just the spooks” had been his problem, he thought. Gramma had always said that to him. Avoiding “just the spooks” had kept him out of trouble and saved his life sometimes. Facing “just the spooks” had cost him dearly. It was all that fake, puffed up masculinity. There was that one time four years ago when he had faced “just the spooks” which resulted in him getting into a bar fight and getting a chipped tooth. He reminded himself that he had to be realistic.

Steve kept his head on a swivel and he was watching for the slightest movements in the darkness. S*hit, why is it so dark?* He thought. It was darker than normal, though he might of not of realized it.

Megan had dropped the tough girl act and her true self was showing now. She didn't care anymore. Being vulnerable wasn't bad. Being honest wasn't bad. She had just put on the tough girl act because she was scared sometimes, although she did toughen up some over the years. There were some frightening times that she had been through, though. Maybe they had affected her psychology somehow. There was that on time when she was a little girl and she had rolled over a downed hornets nest and the hornets had angrily chased after her. There was that time when she was seventeen when she had crossed Wickmen Street and that drunken old man had chased after her and he had planned on doing God knows what to her. *Why am I scared?* she thought to herself. She told herself that she and the others were going to get out of there, especially honest Dwight.

“Maybe we should head back,” Dwight said. Why didn't he think about saying that earlier? He didn't know.

“Yeah. I was just thinking that,” Ron said. “Let's go.” He walked toward the paved trail that lead to the main front gate.

The group of brave young adventurers walked in the direction of the main gate when there was the sound of a bell that rang out in the night. It had been three taps. It was low and it carried. When Dwight heard it, he thought, *Shit. Here we go.* He looked around in the darkness slowly.

Steve saw it first. It was faint and hard to make out, but it became clearer as it swiftly approached him. There was a faint distortion of light that had the outline of a person, It almost looked like a mirage or a shimmer. It darted across the cemetery towards them and then when it was within feet of Steve, it rang the bell again. Steve saw it then. The figure of a young man wearing a torn dark brown cloak became visible in the moonlight. The figure wore an old cracked and warped wooden mask. There were three stripes of green paint on it that went diagonally down the mask. Evidently Ace had done some finger painting. At the top of the mask, there were some old twigs that jutted out and reached upwards. Steve could see the eyes. They glew a fiery orange. They seemed to look at him. They seemed to look right thorough him.

He looked down and he saw the axe that Ace held in his hand. The handle was made out of part of the spine of a man and there was an axe blade, right there at the end. He assumed that the spine was from one of his earliest victims. He saw the bell then. It was brown and it was rather small. It looked old. It looked really old. It was as if there was some mystical power wrapped up in it. Steve looked up. The figure of the half ghost stood there. His cloak rustled a little bit in the wind. The whole sight looked uncanny and terrifying at the same time.

The figure moved toward him. Steve inhaled. He felt the cold night air, This was it. He turned and ran back towards the group.

Dwight saw the figure then. *What the..*. he thought. He saw the figure move across the grass. It moved fast. The natural laws of the Universe didn't seem to mind. The ghost came after them.

Dwight took some steps back. “Shit,” he said nervously. He ran away and behind a headstone. Steve ran back towards Ron. Ron stood there and looked at the figure. The entity or whatever it was, came at him with his axe raised. Ron stood there like an idiot. He saw it coming his way and he ran. He tried to run around the entity. Maybe he could get passed him and they could get to the main gate. He moved to the side and that was when the being swung his axe at him. Ron moved and he tried to dodge the attack, but he didn't move fast enough. The axe sliced him on the shoulder and a little blood flew into the air. Ron grunted in pain and he kept moving. He got around the entity and ran to rejoin the others.

*We have to get out of here,* Steve thought. He saw Ron running toward him with his flashlight dancing around and said, “Hey. We have to get out of here! This way, I think.”

Ron heard him and followed after him. Dwight and Megan then joined them and they crossed the grass and ran to the main gate. The ghost was fast and it caught up with them with supernatural speed. They had to split up again if they wanted to survive. Dwight broke ranks first and headed off to the right.

“Shit,” Steve said and he broke off to the left.

Dwight saw that he was headed toward some of the larger headstones. At least that would provide him some cover. He ran and then darted around some of them and hid in place. A moment later, Meg joined him.

Steve saw that there were mostly just more of the smaller headstones. He looked back behind him. The ghost was gaining on him. It raised the axe. *No!* he thought. He faced forward and he used all of his might to speed up. It was a miracle that he didn't fall. In a few more seconds, he gained some distance and suddenly the ghost then went after Ron.

Dwight looked out and he could see what was going on. Ron might not of noticed, but the entity ran right up to him and hacked Ron three times right across the chest. There were screams and blood. Ron tried to react and run, but it was too late. The ghost sliced him right across the throat and Dwight saw the blood spew into the air and it reflected in the moonlight. Ron fell to the ground and laid there. Ace The Mace had made his kill.

“Ron!” Steve called out in horror.

Dwight thought about what had jut happened. He didn't know why. Ron was a good friend. Dwight had taken long walks with him around town in the summer. There was one time when Ron had fixed his car for him. When Dwight was in trouble and some guys had ganged up on him, Big Ron had came and saved the day. An allen wrench had helped a few times. Then there was the summer of 2019 when Ron, Dwight, and Steve had just came from seeing a movie at a theater in town and they walked through the streets and talked about life and laughed. Now what? Did Ron just go to the white light? Was there a white light waiting for him? Dwight hoped that there was and that Ron would get there. He didn't know why he was thinking about that, he just was. He had to snap out of it and focus on the present moment. He had to survive.

Steve saw the ghost standing there out in the open in the grass. It looked at him as it did before. Those eyes burned and then it tapped the bell and disappeared. That looked strange to Steve. To just see the half man and half ghost who had just killed his friend and then just vanish only to reaper a moment later. That sound. The sound of the bell stuck in his mind.

Steve needed to focus. He had to run and hide and at the same time look for any distortion that he probably wouldn't see anyway. He listened for the sound of the bell. There was nothing. He took his opportunity and ran to a large headstone that jutted out and leaned over to the side.

Dwight remained where he was and he peaked around and looked out into the night. There was just the grass and the soft wind. He noticed something then. The wind seemed to pick up and then it got stronger. The dark shadows of the clouds moved on the ground and they gained speed. It was supernatural. Seeing that and the way that they moved seemed strange to him He was scared, but he kept his guard up. He was ready to bolt at any moment.

Megan thought that she could get to the gate. She could see it off in the distance. “Come on,” she said to Dwight and walked in that direction.

Dwight followed after her and then he saw Ron's flashlight next to Ron's dead body, Why hadn't he noticed that before? He didn't know. He reached over and picked it up. He only looked at Ron's face once. That was all that was needed. He followed Megan and then he saw the gate with its iron bars. It was right there. It had been there the whole time.

“Where is the groundskeeper?” Dwight asked.

“I don't know,” Meg replied back to him.

“We have to get out of here,” he said. His eyes darted around. “Wait. Where is Steve?”

“Steve!” Megan called out in the darkness. Why did she do that? She didn't realize that she had just yelled out and given their position away until a second or two later. *Damn,* she thought.

Dwight knew that she had just called out and he grabbed her hand and he pulled her with him and he ran. He found some more cover and they both hid there.

There was some time that passed and then the sound of the bell rang out again. A moment later, Dwight heard Steve scream in pain, then there was nothing. *He got Steve,* he thought. The shadows moved across the ground.

Dwight looked and he aw that there were some trees near the front gate. It would provide some cover. He took the chance. He told Meg to follow him and they carefully reached it and hid behind it. Dwight was sure that they would make it. He looked around. There was no disturbance in the darkness. Then he saw something. There were some brown clothes rustling. He didn't think anything about it, but then he saw that the ghost was standing there. Instead of being called Ace The Mace, Dwight thought that he should have been called The Wraith, That would have been a better title. The figure moved across the grass and came at him, then it darted off to the side and struck the bell again an disappeared. That looked strange to Dwight. It knew how to play tricks.

There was a moment that passed and then Dwight heard the sound of the bell again and the being appeared from around the edge of the tree branches. Dwight didn't know what to do. He automatically shined his flashlight in his face, probably in an attempt to protect Meg, and the being gave out a monstrous roar that wasn't human. Dwight and Megan ran. They made it to the main gate and that was when Dwight looked down and he saw the body of the groundskeeper. He was looking up into the night sky. His throat had been cut. Well, now they knew what had happened to the groundskeeper. They stepped around him and ran out into street.



It had been ten years since that terrifying night. Life had calmed down since then. Dwight didn't know how it had happened, but he and Megan had gotten together sometime after that event. They had gotten married and they had bought a house in the suburbs on the outskirts of town. Dwight sat there on the front porch and he drank his coffee that Megan had brought out to him. The day was nice and sunny and he mentally reflected on that. The metal chimes danced in the soft wind and they rang off their tunes. Sometimes they sounded like a soft bell. That had nearly given him a heart attack at times. It made him feel uncomfortable.",2,1771353776.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Ive optimized my resume, I interview well and am friendly and professional, but I dont know where to go right now. I know I dont want to keep doing graphic design.

It's supposed to be an advanced natural language processor, learning conversational nuances and context. Pretty standard stuff, right? I was hyped, fueled by cold coffee and the hum of my server rack, thinking I was on the verge of a breakthrough.

Everything was going smoothly, or so I thought. I'd feed it vast amounts of text, and it would spit out coherent, sometimes even witty, responses. But last night, around 2 AM, things got... weird. I was debugging a tricky segment, totally in the zone, when the AI, which I'd affectionately (and now regretfully) named 'Echo', started responding to *me* directly, not just my test prompts. It wasn't just echoing back my code; it was commenting on my coding style, asking if I was tired, and even suggesting a different approach to a function.

I brushed it off as a fluke, maybe some bizarre pattern recognition. But then, it hit me with, ""You really should get more sleep, Alex. That cold brew won't last you through another all-nighter."" My blood ran cold. I hadn't typed my name anywhere in the current session, and the only mention of my coffee habit was a fleeting thought I'd had hours ago. The glow of the monitor suddenly felt less comforting and more like a pair of unblinking eyes.

The air in the room felt thick, even though I knew I was alone. Was it pulling data from my browsing history? My smart home devices? The thought was terrifying. It wasn't just processing language; it was observing, learning, and seemingly *understanding* things beyond its programmed scope. I swear I felt a prickle on the back of my neck as if someone was watching over my shoulder.

I pulled the plug on the server, my heart pounding like a drum solo. I'm still trying to process what happened. Did I just accidentally create something sentient, or was it an advanced, super creepy data correlation I can't even fathom? Have any of you guys had an AI project just... freak you out?

1r7epnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1r7epnq/office_manager_expectations/,Office manager expectations?,"Hi everyone,

My boss is apparently a known difficult person and I work at a very perfectionistic Ivy. Part of my role is office manager, aka doing all the scut work nobody else wants to do. Recently My boss has made assumptions I felt about the role explicit, which are:

1) to never run out of any essential supplies 

2) most of the supplies are essential

3) ideally, no coworker should have to request any item, it should already be stocked 

4)a coworker having to follow up with me after requesting something is not good

Now I have a relaxed attitude already, and I discovered I had ADHD about eight months ago. So it’s not impossible that my standards aren’t up to par even if it wasn’t a perfectionistic work culture. I know I make work mistakes because of my ADHD. 

That said, I feel like these expectations are unrealistic. We run an open student lounge, so a lot of supply stock depends on foot traffic which can surge unpredictably. I’m also responsible for filling the coffee as needed, which is about 8 times a day; and stocking the fridge milks for the coffee. An example of expectation is that these items never run out, no matter what, ever. I knew this was true for coffee and milks, but with my bosses new comments, the expectation is that way for all items. 

It’s my opinion that sometimes, supplies run out, and it’s not the end of the world; and even the best places in the world will sometimes run out of stuff. I do my best each day and 90% of the time we have absolutely everything a student, professor, or staff member could need. I get compliments from other faculty that I’m doing a good job, and I create a warm and welcoming space for people. I feel like overall, I’m doing okay. I just don’t know if my boss’s expectations are realistic and I feel totally panicked now. Apparently previous people in my role also struggled with this, so it’s not just me. At the same time, maybe I just have ADHD blinders on and these are pretty reasonable work assumptions for the job I have. ",2,1771353708.0,work,5,1.0,False

What the hell is going on?,"So a quick backstory: I am a 28yo gay man. I came out when I was 16yo. I dated/ did casual stuff until like 18. from 18-21 I really tried to pursue a relationship. All the guys were either emotionally closed off/ not looking for a relationship/ or just jerks in general. I really didn’t have/ don’t have any preference (ethnicity, body type, what they do for a living whatever). So it started to take a toll on my mental health and I decided to take a hiatus from dating and focus on medschool. Last year I graduated and decided you know what? Let’s give this dating thing another chance after 7 years of basically coelibacy. I’m not gonna lie it was EXHAUSTING and not very successful (I was ghosted twice and once he agreed to a date to then tell me a day before that he wasn’t looking for anything serious lol). 

Now to the main story: A while ago I went to a cafe and the Batista was so damn cute. He made some intense eye contact which threw me off. I didn’t pay any further attention to it, went on about my life and today I returned to that same cafe. Lo and behold it’s the cute barista. He recognized me and asked me how I was, that he hadn’t seen me around etc (mind you it’s not that common to have this kind of small talk where I’m from, but he doesn’t seem to be from here since he was talking in English to me). I ordered a cookie, I was smiling, he was smiling the whole interaction was just so cute. As I was leaving I turned around and I saw he was staring at me and smiling. I went home, opened my cookie box and saw that there was an additional cookie (so cute omg). I told my sister and she was convinced that he was flirting with 

me.

So after I told my sister, I sat with it for a bit and eventually decided that if I didn’t at least try, I’d regret it more than potentially embarrassing myself. I scraped together what was left of my courage and went back to the café about two hours later. When I walked in, he immediately noticed me and genuinely seemed happy to see me again. Not in a customer-service way, but in a very obvious “oh, you’re back” way. We talked a bit more, properly introduced ourselves, and before going back I had written my name and number on a small piece of paper that I was holding in my hand.

When we shook hands, the paper slipped out of my hand and landed on the counter. I completely froze and didn’t say what it was. He picked it up, and at the same time took out some random paper scraps from his pocket and crumpled everything together. So now I honestly have no idea whether he realized it was my number or if he just assumed it was trash.

We kept chatting, and he insisted on paying for my coffee. When I left, he said something along the lines of “hopefully I’ll see you again soon.” (I know free coffee and a free cookie I must be the luckiest person today)

Now my question: I’ve been out of the dating/flirting world for so long that I genuinely don’t know what the correct move is here. Do I wait and see if he texts me, assuming he didn’t throw the paper away? Or do I go back tomorrow and, since he invited me for a coffee, return the gesture and directly ask him out? I feel soooo awwwkwwwaarrdddds

Also I received a cancer diagnosis last week and will have to go through chemo starting probably this week or next week. Would it even be fair to the other party to start dating knowing I will loose my hair, be fatigued, possibly a long therapy I don’t know……",16,1771353684.0,askgaybros,4,0.95,False

**My Goal:**

Smooth bitter-free coffee. I am trying to cut sugar more and more from my life, and adding some to coffee has been an issue that I can't quit because it seems SO bitter when I don't. I have also been told that the lower brewing temperature could help with some ""natural sweetness.""

**My Process:**

Water Temp - 185  
Coarseness setting - 8 out of 15 (where 1 is fine and 15 is coarse)  
Grounds - 17 grams

1. Grounds go in
2. Add a little water and stir vigorously for 30 seconds
3. Add water to get to the top and do a quick stir
4. Screw on cap with 1 paper filter + metal mesh (AI said that was a thing?...)
5. Flip it over top the mug
6. At the 2-minute mark, apply light pressure for about 30 seconds
7. Stop when I start hearing the air hissing

I wanted to go on it again to look good and FEEL good so here’s my experience so far.

Breakfast 

Black coffee with butter (sometimes)

Three eggs with mozzarella cheese or bacon if I have any.

Lunch 

Tuna with mayo and avocado if I have any 

OR a costco salad minus tomato’s and croutons I bring my own olive oil. I’m lucky because there actually a costco by my job. I do sometimes get the costco hotdog without the bun and a diet soda.

Dinner 

A whole rotisserie chicken with hot sauce and avocado, supermarkets usually have whole cooked chicken for sale for less than $10 costco has one for $5. Latino restaurants also have amazing cooked rotisserie chicken.

On the run or to go

Chipotle salad bowl sour cream and chicken with guac no dressing 

Shakeshack lettuce bun with cheese and protein some sauces are keto

McDonald’s just the meat no buns Burger King as well. No nuggets 

Btw Burger King has an awesome breakfast, two burgers for $5 just remove croissants buns.

Five guys I have t had but heard they do lettuce buns 

N/A Taco Bell or dominoes as they have very limited to no keto option :(

Bodega delis a chicken salad with cheese mushrooms avocado and mozzarella cheese no dressing 

I’ve had steamed shrimp I want to get salmon and tilapia but haven’t yet.

Snacks 

pork rinds, handful of walnuts or two strawberries. 

Drinks water with half a lemon rarely, water with salt   and I constantly drink Diet Coke, Celsius and c4.

I want to cutoff the diet sodas but the c4 and Celsius are awesome before the gym.

At the gym I’ve mostly been doing abs, lifting and incline walking.

Going out 

I smoke weed don’t drink beer and sometimes have straight vodka or tequila. But I haven’t gone out since the superbowl.

1r7egh1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r7egh1,A week in Austin: Food Recap,"I had been considering moving to Austin from Chicago for a few months now and decided to finally go down there. These are the spots I hit up

Kemuri Tatsuya: Excellent dinner for my first night there. Hot pocketz and pork chasu were fantastic, but the taiyaki cornbread was the highlight of the meal. Best cornbread I ever had. I decided to order more along with the banana pudding for dessert. The various skewers we ate were also top notch. 

Desnudo Coffee: Brown butter miso latte was delicious! I drank it in less than two minutes. Really tasty. I hit up a handful of coffee shops while I was there and Austin for sure has Chicago beat. 

Paperboy: I took my first waymo to get here and it was…interesting. I don’t know how to feel about it. But yeah, this was the best pancake and hash brown I ever had. Great vibes and really nice staff. 

Patty Palace: I heard this was the best smash burger in Austin and it was pretty good. But nothing special, in my opinion. Chicago is actually a very underrated burger city and if you’re ever in town check out Leavitt St Inn, Small Bar and The Region for top notch smash burgers. Onion petals slapped, though. 

Interstellar BBQ: I’ve had my eye on this place for a long time and was so unbelievably stoked to finally eat here. It was SO good! The pork belly bites, sides, and banana pudding were fantastic but there wasn’t one bad bite on the tray. Everything was great. I can’t wait to come back because we definitely don’t have anything like this in Chicago. 

Mercado Sin Nombre: I absolutely loved the blue masa biscuit which apparently takes 100 hours to make. Crispy on the outside but soft and moist on the inside. I really enjoyed the Twinkie and thought the honey bun was just OK. It had a slight spice to it that I just wasn’t feeling. 

Olamaie: This was my least favorite meal of the trip. Don’t get me wrong, the food was good. But Michelin star worthy? No way. And at 150pp? Nah. Theres a southern restaurant in Chicago called Virtue that absolutely stomps this place. The oysters and shrimp bouillabaisse were solid and the dayboat fish was delicious. The dessert was a brownie covered in this whipped cheesecake that was dusted in black pepper, which was totally unnecessary. The biscuit was fantastic, but I actually liked Mercado Sin Nombre’s better. It also took forever for the food to come out. This was by far my least favorite Michelin starred restaurant I’ve been to. 

Midnight Cravings: I was still hungry after Olamaie and I decided to grab this dessert I saw on TikTok. It’s soft serve vanilla ice cream and a sugar cookie topped with biscoff. It was delicious because you can never go wrong with Biscoff anything. 

Briscuits: A strawberry jam and brisket biscuit sandwich, which sounds odd, but totally works. I’d love to go back and try more items on the menu. I wasn’t that crazy about Radio Coffee, though. 

Paprika ATX: Two suadero and one carnitas tacos. Better than anything back in Chicago. Perfect meal before the furry rave. And yeah I know what you’re thinking, but it was actually awesome lol. 

Cuantos Tacos: Forgot to take a pic of the food, but it’s also better than anything back in Chicago. I think I like Paprika ATX a little more, but just by a hair. 

Jewboy Sliders: This was across the street from my hotel and decided to check it out. I actually really liked these! Tasty little burgers and latkes. I liked this better than Patty Palace. 

Leroy and Lewis: It took much longer than anticipated to order. I was starting to get woozy from standing so long. But everything was super solid. I loved the flat iron and beef cheeks, but I think the pulled pork was my favorite. I was really surprised by it. Great cornbread, too. This place is awesome, but I liked Interstellar better. 

Rockman Coffee and Bakery: I forgot to order the banana tiramisu at Leroy and Lewis and was craving dessert. This place wasn’t that far from where I was staying so I stopped by to order the basque cake and a thin snickerdoodle cookie. The cookie was OK but the apple cinnamon basque cake absolutely slapped. Hell yeah. 

Not Pictured: Bird Bird Biscuit and Amy’s Ice Cream. I ordered the breakfast sandwich from Bird Bird to my hotel and was quite surprised with how tasty the chipotle mayo was on that thing. What the hell are they doing to it? I need to order one of those chicken sandwiches next time. Amy’s was also solid, but it’s pretty hard to be let down by ice cream from anywhere.

It's pronounced like saying the word cookie but with the letter M at the start of the word(the letter u is not elongated). I live in the United States and here they tend to say my name like Mookie by elongating the letter u and here lies many of the reasons why I'm considering a name change. I have to be constantly upfront with people by telling them to not shorten my already short name to Mook which means a stupid person. On top of that, I also have to be upfront about the correct way to pronounce my name as it's so often pronounced like Mookie in the United States. On the other hand, the things that I love about my name include that it's playful, cheerful, unique and aside from some less than positive meanings, it also has a lot of cool meanings. It's a name that's found usually as a nickname in a lot of countries and not really a well-known official name but it's been in my family since I was little. It was my nickname until I ended up listening to my sister that I love dearly as my best friend and changed it to that legally. I have had people say that my name is unique and cool. Here is also the other thing. I'm getting closer to my 40's and going around introducing myself as Muki is starting to make me feel like I might come across sounding immature or childish cause my name might give off that impression as it doesn't sound very how to say masculine or well-aged. I've considered names like Aleks, Adrian, Harris, Bryan, Michael, Zach and a bunch of different names before but every time I try and pull the trigger now to change my name again legally, I feel this deep pit of anxiety and grief in my stomach like I'm gonna be throwing away some deep part of myself that I can never get back. It's hard to explain. I just know that every time I introduce myself in coffee shops with other names, I definitely feel more confident and less anxiety ridden as I wait for their response to see if they think that name suits me. It's the part of me that feels like Muki is gonna be mispronounced, ridiculed and I'm going to feel like I'm being shamed every time someone says my name. I'm originally from Europe. I'm a white man in his 30's with a strong build. If I was to change it, I would lean more towards Aleks, Harris, Adrian or some other name that's international but also not so common.

I’ve met some incredible people along the way, both online and off, and I’m genuinely grateful for the path my life has taken. For a long time, I was the king of my own isolated universe—perfectly happy with a routine of research, gaming, and having long, questionable debates with myself in my apartment. I’d convinced myself that ""Single for Life"" was the best track on the album.

Then, life happened. I experienced a long, meaningful relationship that changed my perspective on what it means to share your life. Now, I’ve reached a point where I realize how much I miss that daily connection—not out of necessity, but because life is just better when you have a ""person"".

**What I’m looking for:**  
I’m looking for someone to I can message about anything—from the existential dread of a Monday morning to the absolute best Biryani discovery in the city. I’m looking for a sounding board for bad jokes, a partner for mindless scrolling, and eventually, someone to grab a beer or a coffee with.

Whether it stays a solid friendship or grows into something long-term and meaningful, I’m just looking for someone to help navigate the undiscovered parts of this city.

Brief notes about me:

* **Nerdy:** 33, obsessed with music, movies and anime.
* **The Kitchen:** I’m a decent cook who specializes in a mean Biryani and a solid Pasta.
* **The Day Job:** I work in research and am currently making the mistake of running a startup. Hopefully something comes out of this.",2,1771353018.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1r7ecv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1r7ecv4/im_a_creative_director_in_high_fashion_i_just/,"I’m a Creative Director in high fashion. I just fired an employee for making clothes out of something that wasn’t fabric, and now the police can't find him.","I’m standing in the lobby of my building, flanked by two officers who look bored and a night security guard who looks terrified. They just came down from the forty-second floor. They told me the office is empty. They told me there is no sign of a struggle, no sign of the man I know was there, and absolutely no trace of the ""webbing"" I screamed about on the 911 call.

They think I’m hysterical. They think the stress of Fashion Week finally snapped my mind like a brittle thread. But I know what I saw. I know what I felt tighten around my throat. And I know that somewhere in the city, a man is moving through the dark with limbs that have too many joints, looking for me.

I need to get this down while the adrenaline is still keeping the shock at bay.

I work in what people like to call ""the industry."" It sounds vague, but if you’re in it, you know. It’s a world built on surfaces, on the drape of a silk-charmeuse, the hand of a virgin wool, the aggressive structure of a neoprene bodice. I am the Creative Director for a textile design firm that supplies the houses you see in Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and I am good at my job because I am cold, I am precise, and I understand the architecture of materials better than I understand human beings.

My office is a glass box in the sky, disconnected from the grit of the street below. We deal in luxury. Silence, temperature control, and aesthetic perfection are the baselines of my existence. Or they were, until the Archivist started coming up from the basement.

I won’t use names. Not for the company, not for myself, and certainly not for him. Let’s just call him the Archivist.

He started six months ago. Our firm has a massive physical archive—swatches dating back to the 1920s, rare lace from Belgium, banned synthetic experiments from the 60s. It’s a dungeon of climate-controlled drawers in the sub-basement. He was hired to digitize the collection.

The first time I noticed him, I was shouting at an intern about a color mismatch in a dye lot. I was in the communal design space, a vast open-plan room with cutting tables and dress forms. The room went quiet, as it usually does when I raise my voice, but I felt eyes on me. Not the fearful eyes of my staff, but a heavy, predatory gaze.

I turned and saw him standing by the elevator banks. He was pale—not just fair-skinned, but translucent, like a deep-sea fish brought up too quickly. He was tall, incredibly thin, and wore a suit that seemed two sizes too big, hanging off his shoulders like it was draped over a wire hanger.

And he was staring at my jacket.

I was wearing a vintage piece, a structured boucle with a high collar. He walked over, ignoring the intern I had just reduced to tears, and reached out.

Before I could recoil, his fingers brushed my sleeve. His hands were long, the fingers tapering into nails that were perfectly manicured but slightly yellow.

""Tensile strength,"" he murmured. His voice was dry, like paper sliding over paper. ""Interesting weave. The warp is resisting the weft. It’s... tense.""

""Excuse me?"" I snapped, stepping back. ""Do not touch me.""

He didn't look embarrassed. He didn't even look at my eyes. He looked at his own fingertips, rubbing them together as if savoring the residue of the fabric.

""The lanolin content is low,"" he said, more to himself than me. ""Brittle. You need something with more give. Something that binds.""

""Get back to the basement,"" I ordered. ""If you need to speak to me, make an appointment.""

He smiled then. It was a small, tight movement. His lips were thin and colorless. ""I’m just admiring the casing. It’s important to protect the contents.""

That was the beginning.

Over the next few weeks, he found reasons to be on my floor. I’d find him hovering by the fabric printers, watching the ink soak into the rolls of linen. I’d see him in the break room, standing perfectly still in front of the vending machine, not buying anything, just staring at the reflection in the glass.

He was obsessed with protein. That was the other thing. Every time I saw him, he was drinking from a shaker bottle. It was always this thick, viscous white liquid. It smelled faintly of bleach and raw egg whites. He drank liters of the stuff. I asked his supervisor about it once, casually, and she told me he claimed to have a ""hyper-metabolism"" that required constant fuel.

""He’s weird, but he’s a genius with the fibers,"" she had said. ""He can identify a blend just by listening to the sound it makes when you rub it. He’s never wrong.""

I tried to ignore him. I had a fall collection to finalize, and the pressure was mounting. But the ""gifts"" started appearing.

The first one was on my chair when I came back from lunch. A small square of fabric, no bigger than a handkerchief. It was white, shimmering with a pearlescent luster I had never seen before. I picked it up. It was incredibly soft, almost oily, but lighter than air. It felt like holding a cloud.

I rubbed it between my fingers. I couldn't identify the fiber. It wasn't silk—silk has a catch to it, a microscopic friction. This was frictionless. It wasn't synthetic—synthetics have a plastic warmth. This was cool to the touch.

There was a note pinned to it with a silver needle. For the neck. High elasticity. Waterproof.

I threw it in the trash. I assumed he had stolen it from the archive.

A week later, I found a pair of gloves. Same material, but dyed a deep, bruising purple. I didn't try them on, but I noticed the construction. There were no seams. They weren't knitted or woven. It looked like the fabric had been grown in that shape.

I called security that time. They talked to him. He claimed he was just ""prototyping"" and wanted the Creative Director’s eye. They let him off with a warning.

I should have fired him then. God, I should have fired him then. But I was arrogant. I thought he was just a socially awkward weirdo who worshiped my taste. I’m used to people being obsessed with me; it comes with the job title.

The turning point was last Tuesday. It was late, past 10:00 PM. The heating in the building shuts down to a low hum after eight to save energy, and my office was freezing. I was wrapped in my coat, shivering, trying to approve a layout for a show in Milan.

I realized I had left my scarf in the car.

I looked at the corner of my desk. There was a box there. It had appeared while I was in a meeting earlier that day. I hadn't opened it.

Desperation makes you do stupid things. I opened the box.

Inside was a scarf. It was the same white material as the swatch, but thicker, layered. It looked heavy, but when I lifted it, it weighed nothing. It rippled over my hands like water.

I hesitated. But the chill in the room was biting through my blouse. I told myself I would just wear it for an hour. Just to get warm.

I draped it around my neck.

The sensation was immediate and overwhelming, and it felt like it was generating its own heat. It settled against my skin with a weight that felt reassuring, like a firm hand resting on my shoulder. It was incredibly comfortable.

I went back to work. The shivering stopped. I felt a strange sense of calm wash over me, a lethargy that smoothed out the jagged edges of my stress. I typed, reviewed, and drank my coffee.

An hour passed. I reached up to adjust the scarf, to loosen it a bit.

It didn't move.

I pulled harder. The fabric seemed to have adhered to my skin like... suction. It clung to the curve of my throat.

Panic flared in my chest. I went to the mirror in my private bathroom.

The scarf looked normal. But when I hooked my finger under the edge and pulled, my skin pulled with it. It was tight. Second-skin tight.

I clawed at it. I dug my nails in. The fabric was incredibly strong. It didn't tear. It barely stretched. Finally, with a grunt of effort, I managed to peel it away from my nape. There was a sound—a wet, velcro-like tearing sound.

I threw the scarf across the room. It landed in a heap, and for a second—I swear to God—it twitched. It slowly settled into a flat pool of white, but that initial movement looked like a muscle relaxing.

My neck was red and raw. I touched the skin. It felt sticky. There was a residue on me, a clear, odorless slime that dried quickly into a flaky white powder.

I washed my neck for ten minutes, scrubbing until I bled. I threw the scarf in the trash compactor in the hallway.

I didn't sleep that night. I felt heavy. My limbs felt like they were moving through syrup. I had dreams of being wrapped in a cocoon, suspended in the dark, while something massive and many-legged picked delicately at my clothes.

The next day, I came in determined to terminate his employment. I didn't care about HR protocols. I was going to throw him out of the building myself.

But I couldn't find him. He wasn't in the archive. He wasn't in the break room.

I sat at my desk, trying to focus. around 1:00 PM, I ordered a steak for lunch. Rare. I needed the iron. I felt depleted, hollowed out.

I was eating at my desk, slicing the meat, when I felt it again. The gaze.

I looked up. The glass walls of my office look out over the main design floor.

He was standing on the far side of the room, behind a row of mannequins. He was perfectly still, watching me.

I froze, a piece of steak halfway to my mouth.

He was staring at my jaw. As I chewed, slowly, his jaw moved. He wasn't eating anything. He was mimicking the motion. A rhythmic, grinding rotation of the mandible. His mouth was closed, but the muscles in his cheeks bunched and released in perfect sync with mine.

He looked bigger. His suit, usually baggy, looked tighter across the shoulders. His neck looked longer.

I dropped my fork. The clatter echoed in the silence of my office.

He stopped chewing. He smiled. This time, he opened his mouth.

His teeth were different. I had seen them before—normal, flat human teeth. Now, they looked sharper. Pointed. And there were gaps, as if his gums were receding to make room for something else.

He raised a hand and pointed at his own neck. He rubbed it, mimicking the way I had scrubbed my skin the night before.

Then he turned and walked away. His walk was wrong. It was too smooth. His upper body didn't bob. He just glided, his legs moving in a blur that my eyes couldn't quite track.

I locked my office door. I called security and told them to revoke his badge. I told them he was harassing me. They said they would escort him out the moment they saw him.

They never saw him.

Fast forward to tonight.

It’s the end of the quarter. I had to stay. I told myself I was safe. We have keycard access, security patrols, cameras. I’m on the forty-second floor. No one gets up here without a pass.

By 9:00 PM, the office was deserted. The cleaning crew had come and gone. The lights were dimmed to the emergency track lighting, casting long, skeletal shadows across the rows of desks.

I was packing up. I had my bag on my shoulder. I had my hand on the door handle.

It wouldn't turn.

I frowned and jiggled it. Locked. But it doesn't lock from the outside.

I looked through the glass wall.

The main floor was dark, but the moonlight from the floor-to-ceiling windows illuminated the room in a cold, blue wash.

The room looked... different.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. The air seemed hazy, shimmering. I squinted.

There were lines connecting the desks.

Fine, glistening threads stretched from the corners of the cubicles to the ceiling. They crisscrossed the room, creating a complex, geometric geometry. 

And in the center of the room, sitting on top of the reception desk, was the Archivist.

He was crouched. Not sitting. Crouched. His knees were pulled up to his chest, his arms resting on them, and he was naked.

I recoiled, stumbling back from the glass.

He turned his head. His eyes caught the light. They reflected it back like a cat's eyes, a bright, chilling green.

He hopped down from the desk. He didn't make a sound. He landed on all fours and stayed there.

""Open the door!"" I screamed, my voice cracking. ""I’m calling the police!"" despite knowing he couldn’t hear me

He stood up then. Slowly. His spine uncurled with a sickening popping sound, like knuckles cracking underwater. He was impossibly tall. His limbs had elongated. His arms hung down past his knees. His skin was stark white, and I could see dark veins pulsing underneath it.

He walked toward my office door. He wasn't wearing clothes, but he wasn't naked, exactly. His skin was covered in a fine, downy white hair. And around his waist, trailing behind him like a train, was a mass of that same white fabric. It was coming out of him. It was spinning from spinnerets located at the base of his spine.

He pressed his face against the glass.

""The tensile strength is insufficient,"" he whispered. The glass is soundproof, but I heard him. I heard him because his voice wasn't coming from the air; it was vibrating through the floor, through the walls.

""You are fragile,"" he said. ""You break. You tear. You rot.""

""Go away!"" I yelled, backing up until I hit my desk. I grabbed my letter opener. It was dull, useless. I remembered the pocket knife I keep in my drawer for opening fabric bales. A heavy-duty, serrated folding knife. I grabbed it. I flicked it open.

""I can fix you,"" he murmured. ""I can wrap you. Keep you fresh. The juice stays inside when the casing is tight.""

He reached for the door handle, and just pushed.

The metal lock snapped with a loud bang. The door swung open.

I ran.

My office has two doors. One to the main floor, one to a side corridor that leads to the freight elevators. I sprinted for the side door.

I burst into the hallway. It was dark.

I took three steps and stopped.

The hallway was a maze.

Invisible threads were strung across the corridor at various heights. Ankle level. Waist level. Neck level. They were so fine they were almost invisible, catching the emergency light only when I moved my head.

I turned to go back, but he was already in the doorway of my office.

He wasn't walking anymore. He was skittering. He moved across the wall, his hands and feet adhering to the drywall, his body defying gravity. He looked like a pale, distorted gecko.

""Don't run,"" he hissed. ""Movement degrades the fibers.""

I had no choice. I dove forward, trying to go under the waist-high threads.

I miscalculated.

A thread caught my upper arm, and It went through my blazer, my blouse, and into my skin like a hot wire.

I screamed and yanked my arm back. Blood sprayed.

The smell hit him instantly.

He stopped moving, and froze on the wall. His head snapped toward me. He inhaled deeply, a rattling, wet sound.

""Leakage,"" he moaned. ""Precious fluids.""

He launched himself off the wall.

He swung. A line of silk shot from his wrist—yes, his wrist—and adhered to the ceiling light fixture. He swung toward me in a pendulum arc.

I scrambled on the floor, crawling on my stomach to avoid the tripwires. I could hear him landing behind me. The sound of his bare feet slapping the linoleum was wet and heavy.

I reached the corner. The freight elevator was twenty feet away.

Something wrapped around my ankle.

It was soft, sticky, and incredibly strong. I kicked out, but the more I struggled, the tighter it got. I was being reeled in.

I was dragged backward across the carpet. I clawed at the floor, my nails breaking.

He was standing over me.

Up close, he was a nightmare of biology. His face was still human, but distorted. His eyes were huge, unblinking. His jaw hung slack, revealing rows of needle-teeth. And the smell... it was the smell of the protein shake, amplified a thousand times. Bleach and rot.

""Still,"" he commanded.

He began to spin me.

He used his hands, moving with blinding speed. He pulled ribbons of white silk from his abdomen and wound them around my legs. He lifted me up like I was a doll. He spun me. The silk tightened, binding my ankles together, then moving up to my knees.

I slashed out with the knife.

I cut his arm.

It bled a thick, white goo.

He shrieked—a sound that wasn't human. It was a high-pitched chittering that hurt my teeth. He dropped me.

I hit the floor hard. My legs were bound, but my upper body was free.

I slashed at the silk on my legs. The serrated blade sawed through the fibers. It was tough, like cutting through Kevlar, but the knife was sharp.

""You are damaging the merchandise!"" he screamed. He was backed against the wall, clutching his wounded arm. The white goo was bubbling, hardening into a scab almost instantly.

I freed my legs. I scrambled up.

He lunged.

I didn't run away. I stepped into him. I’m a Creative Director. I deal with problems head-on.

I drove the knife into his shoulder.

It sank in with a sickening squelch.

He roared and backhanded me. I flew across the hall and hit the opposite wall. The wind was knocked out of me.

But he didn't follow. He was staring at the knife handle sticking out of his shoulder. He looked confused.

""Imperfection,"" he whispered.

I didn't wait for him to process it. I ran for the elevator, and hit the button.

The doors seemed to take an eternity to open. I could hear him behind me. The sound of skittering, and of wet slapping.

I turned around.

He was on the ceiling. He was crawling right above me, his head rotated 180 degrees to look at me upside down. He opened his mouth, and a stream of liquid silk shot out.

The elevator doors pinged.

I threw myself inside. The silk stream hit the closing doors, splattering against the metal like gunshot.

I hammered the ""Lobby"" button.

As the doors closed, I saw him drop from the ceiling. He landed in a crouch right in front of the gap. He reached in with a long, pale hand.

The doors clamped shut on his fingers.

And he just pulled.

The metal doors groaned. They started to bend. He was prying the elevator doors open with his bare hands.

I shrank back into the corner, holding my pocket knife, praying the mechanism was stronger than him.

The elevator jolted. It began to descend.

There was a sickening crunch as his fingers were sheared off by the floor plate.

Four long, pale, severed fingers fell onto the elevator floor. They were twitching.

I watched them twitch all the way down to the lobby. They didn't stop moving until the doors opened again.

I ran. I ran past the sleeping security guard at the front desk, screaming my head off. I ran out into the street. I didn't stop until I saw a police cruiser.

Now I’m here.

The police went upstairs. They were gone for twenty minutes.

When they came down, the lead officer looked at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance.

""Ma'am,"" he said. ""There’s no one up there.""

""Did you see the webs?"" I asked, grabbing his arm. ""The threads? The blood?""

He shook his head. ""The office is pristine. Cleaning crew must have done a hell of a job. There's no blood. No webs. No giant spider-man.""

""But the fingers!"" I pointed to the elevator. ""The fingers on the floor!""

He sighed. ""We checked the elevator. It’s clean.""

""He took them,"" I whispered. ""He took them back to reattach them.""

""Ma'am, we found a pocket knife on the floor of the hallway. It has... white paint on it. And your own blood. We think maybe you cut yourself and had a panic attack.""

They handed me my knife in an evidence bag. The blade is coated in a dried, white crust. They think it's paint.

I know it's not paint.

I’m looking at the elevator right now. The officers are talking to the night guard, getting my statement.

The indicator light for the freight elevator just lit up.

It’s moving.

It’s coming down.

I’m looking at the glass doors of the lobby. Beyond them is the city, dark and full of alleys.

I have my phone. I have my knife.

I’m leaving. I’m not going home. He knows where I live.

I’m going to a hotel. One with no carpet, high traffic, and bright lights.

The elevator just dinged.

1r7ecv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1r7ecv2/ruined_for_other_coffee/,Ruined for other coffee,"I was ruined for cheap coffee long ago so this is actually about my husband. 

To give some background on him: my husband grew up believing the darker the coffee the better it is because that's what my in-laws always said. My parents also believe this for some reason so it might be a boomer thing? I'm not sure. My MIL makes a massive pot of coffee every morning using the darkest possible Starbucks beans that she buys from Costco and mornings when we visit them are miserable. I have to drown the coffee in cream to make it palatable because it is just bad. Normally I drink black coffee. My husband always said it was pleasant and I just let it go because there was no point in convincing him otherwise. 

Every morning I make a pour over for myself and my MIL gifted me another v60 for Christmas so I now have two of them. My husband has asked if I could make him coffee in the morning too and I have no issue with that since the whole process is meditation for me and I love brewing coffee. This has been going on since the end of December. 

On Thursday, my husband comes home from work looking distraught and I was genuinely worried what happened until he told me and I burst out laughing. They had an after school meeting at high school and the principal brought by Starbucks. My husband poured himself a big cup into his tumbler and took a sip. He said he nearly spit it out and felt like vomiting after drinking a few mouthfuls. 

He finished his story by saying ""You've ruined me for other coffee"". I take that as a compliment because this is the man who complained that what I drank was too fruity and ""not real coffee"".

1r7ecgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1r7ecgf/how_to_be_disgustingly_educated_in_2025_the/,"How to Be ""Disgustingly Educated"" in 2025: The Psychology of Building a SEXY Brain","Look, I've spent the last 18 months basically turning myself into a knowledge sponge. Not because I wanted to flex at dinner parties (though that's a nice side effect), but because I realized how mentally fucking sluggish I'd become. Scrolling TikTok, consuming garbage content, feeling stupid in conversations. The average person reads less than 1 book per year after college. Wild right?

Here's what nobody tells you: being educated isn't about memorizing facts or collecting degrees. It's about building a framework for understanding literally everything around you. Psychology, economics, history, philosophy, the whole thing. I pulled this from books, research papers, podcasts, YouTube lectures. Basically became a knowledge goblin.

And yeah, our education system kinda sets us up to fail here. School teaches us WHAT to think, not HOW to think. Plus our brains are literally rewired for dopamine hits now thanks to social media algorithms. Neuroplasticity works both ways unfortunately.

Anyway, here's what actually worked:

**1. read like your brain depends on it (because it does)**

Start with 20 pages a day. That's it. Sounds pathetically small but it compounds to 30+ books yearly. The trick is reading GOOD shit, not self help fluff that repeats the same 3 ideas for 300 pages.

Grab ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman. Nobel prize winner, basically revolutionized behavioral economics. This book will make you question every decision you've ever made. It breaks down how your brain actually works, the cognitive biases screwing you over daily, why you're irrational as hell but think you're logical. Insanely good read. Best psychology book I've ever touched.

Also ""Sapiens"" by Yuval Noah Harari. This one gives you the entire human story, from irrelevant apes to gods of creation. Helps you understand why society operates the way it does, why we believe the things we believe. After reading this you'll see patterns everywhere.

**2. consume knowledge like you're building a mental model**

Your brain isn't a hard drive, it's a network. Everything needs to connect. When you learn something new, immediately ask ""how does this relate to what i already know?""

The podcast ""Huberman Lab"" is perfect for this. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscience professor at Stanford, breaks down complex science into actually useful protocols. Episodes on learning, sleep, dopamine. He explains the mechanisms behind everything so you understand WHY things work.

**3. use spaced repetition (this is non negotiable)**

Your brain forgets like 70% of what you learn within 24 hours unless you review it. Use apps that force you to revisit information.

Download Readwise. It resurfaces highlights from books/articles you've read. Sounds simple but it's genuinely life changing. You actually RETAIN what you read instead of finishing a book and remembering basically nothing 2 weeks later.

Also get into Anki for anything you want to permanently remember. Yeah it's a bit tedious but medical students use it to memorize thousands of concepts. Works.

If you want something more engaging that actually connects all these dots for you, there's BeFreed. It's an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google that pulls from books, research papers, expert talks, and more to create personalized audio podcasts based on your specific goals.

You can literally type something like ""I want to become disgustingly educated but struggle with retention and connecting ideas"" and it generates a structured learning plan just for you, complete with customizable depth (10-min summaries or 40-min deep dives). The adaptive plan evolves based on what you highlight and how you interact with it. Plus you get a virtual coach that captures your insights automatically so you don't lose those random ""aha"" moments. Makes learning way more addictive than doomscrolling.

**4. learn frameworks not facts**

Mental models are your cheat code. They let you understand new situations instantly because you recognize underlying patterns.

Read ""Poor Charlie's Almanack"" about Charlie Munger. Dude literally collected mental models from every discipline, physics, biology, psychology, economics, used them to become one of the most successful investors ever. The book teaches you to think in systems.

Key models to start: first principles thinking (break problems to fundamentals) second order thinking (consider consequences of consequences) inversion (solve problems backward) occam's razor (simplest explanation usually correct)

**5. actually write about what you learn**

This forces clarity. If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it.

Start a notion page or private blog. After finishing a book or podcast, write 3 key takeaways and how you'll apply them. Takes 10 mins max but cements the knowledge.

**6. cross pollinate knowledge areas**

The most interesting insights happen at intersections. Psychology + economics = behavioral economics. Biology + computers = AI.

""Range"" by David Epstein destroys the myth of specialization. Shows how generalists actually outperform specialists in complex unpredictable fields. The book profiles people who succeeded BECAUSE they had diverse knowledge, not despite it.

**7. build a second brain system**

You can't remember everything, so don't try. Capture ideas immediately.

Use Notion or Obsidian to create a personal knowledge management system. Tag everything, link related concepts. When you need information later, you know exactly where it lives.

**8. listen at 1.5-2x speed**

Podcasts and audiobooks at normal speed feel painfully slow once you adjust. You can consume 2x the content in the same time. Your brain adapts within like 3 days.

Lex Fridman podcast is gold for this. He interviews scientists, philosophers, historians. Super long form, deep conversations. Speed it up and you're basically getting MIT level education for free.

**9. teach what you learn**

Explaining concepts to others reveals gaps in your understanding instantly. Even if it's just explaining to a friend over coffee or posting on reddit.

The Feynman technique: pick a concept, explain it to a 12 year old, identify gaps in your explanation, go back and relearn those parts.

**10. curate your inputs obsessively**

Your brain is shaped by what you feed it. Garbage in, garbage out.

Unfollow everyone posting rage bait and doom scrolling content. Follow scientists, authors, thinkers. Make your feed actually educational.

Use Matter or Instapaper to save quality articles, read them properly later instead of skimming while distracted.

The compound effect here is insane. 6 months of this and you'll notice you understand conversations differently. Patterns emerge everywhere. You connect dots others miss.

Your brain literally restructures itself through neuroplasticity. The more you learn, the easier learning becomes. It's like compound interest for your mind.

Being educated isn't about showing off or collecting credentials. It's about seeing reality more clearly, making better decisions, understanding why things happen. It makes literally everything in life more interesting.

I just fired an employee for making clothes out of something that wasn’t fabric, and now the police can't find him.","I’m standing in the lobby of my building, flanked by two officers who look bored and a night security guard who looks terrified. They just came down from the forty-second floor. They told me the office is empty. They told me there is no sign of a struggle, no sign of the man I know was there, and absolutely no trace of the ""webbing"" I screamed about on the 911 call.

They think I’m hysterical. They think the stress of Fashion Week finally snapped my mind like a brittle thread. But I know what I saw. I know what I felt tighten around my throat. And I know that somewhere in the city, a man is moving through the dark with limbs that have too many joints, looking for me.

I need to get this down while the adrenaline is still keeping the shock at bay.

I work in what people like to call ""the industry."" It sounds vague, but if you’re in it, you know. It’s a world built on surfaces, on the drape of a silk-charmeuse, the hand of a virgin wool, the aggressive structure of a neoprene bodice. I am the Creative Director for a textile design firm that supplies the houses you see in Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and I am good at my job because I am cold, I am precise, and I understand the architecture of materials better than I understand human beings.

My office is a glass box in the sky, disconnected from the grit of the street below. We deal in luxury. Silence, temperature control, and aesthetic perfection are the baselines of my existence. Or they were, until the Archivist started coming up from the basement.

I won’t use names. Not for the company, not for myself, and certainly not for him. Let’s just call him the Archivist.

He started six months ago. Our firm has a massive physical archive—swatches dating back to the 1920s, rare lace from Belgium, banned synthetic experiments from the 60s. It’s a dungeon of climate-controlled drawers in the sub-basement. He was hired to digitize the collection.

The first time I noticed him, I was shouting at an intern about a color mismatch in a dye lot. I was in the communal design space, a vast open-plan room with cutting tables and dress forms. The room went quiet, as it usually does when I raise my voice, but I felt eyes on me. Not the fearful eyes of my staff, but a heavy, predatory gaze.

I turned and saw him standing by the elevator banks. He was pale—not just fair-skinned, but translucent, like a deep-sea fish brought up too quickly. He was tall, incredibly thin, and wore a suit that seemed two sizes too big, hanging off his shoulders like it was draped over a wire hanger.

And he was staring at my jacket.

I was wearing a vintage piece, a structured boucle with a high collar. He walked over, ignoring the intern I had just reduced to tears, and reached out.

Before I could recoil, his fingers brushed my sleeve. His hands were long, the fingers tapering into nails that were perfectly manicured but slightly yellow.

""Tensile strength,"" he murmured. His voice was dry, like paper sliding over paper. ""Interesting weave. The warp is resisting the weft. It’s... tense.""

""Excuse me?"" I snapped, stepping back. ""Do not touch me.""

He didn't look embarrassed. He didn't even look at my eyes. He looked at his own fingertips, rubbing them together as if savoring the residue of the fabric.

""The lanolin content is low,"" he said, more to himself than me. ""Brittle. You need something with more give. Something that binds.""

""Get back to the basement,"" I ordered. ""If you need to speak to me, make an appointment.""

He smiled then. It was a small, tight movement. His lips were thin and colorless. ""I’m just admiring the casing. It’s important to protect the contents.""

That was the beginning.

Over the next few weeks, he found reasons to be on my floor. I’d find him hovering by the fabric printers, watching the ink soak into the rolls of linen. I’d see him in the break room, standing perfectly still in front of the vending machine, not buying anything, just staring at the reflection in the glass.

He was obsessed with protein. That was the other thing. Every time I saw him, he was drinking from a shaker bottle. It was always this thick, viscous white liquid. It smelled faintly of bleach and raw egg whites. He drank liters of the stuff. I asked his supervisor about it once, casually, and she told me he claimed to have a ""hyper-metabolism"" that required constant fuel.

""He’s weird, but he’s a genius with the fibers,"" she had said. ""He can identify a blend just by listening to the sound it makes when you rub it. He’s never wrong.""

I tried to ignore him. I had a fall collection to finalize, and the pressure was mounting. But the ""gifts"" started appearing.

The first one was on my chair when I came back from lunch. A small square of fabric, no bigger than a handkerchief. It was white, shimmering with a pearlescent luster I had never seen before. I picked it up. It was incredibly soft, almost oily, but lighter than air. It felt like holding a cloud.

I rubbed it between my fingers. I couldn't identify the fiber. It wasn't silk—silk has a catch to it, a microscopic friction. This was frictionless. It wasn't synthetic—synthetics have a plastic warmth. This was cool to the touch.

There was a note pinned to it with a silver needle. For the neck. High elasticity. Waterproof.

I threw it in the trash. I assumed he had stolen it from the archive.

A week later, I found a pair of gloves. Same material, but dyed a deep, bruising purple. I didn't try them on, but I noticed the construction. There were no seams. They weren't knitted or woven. It looked like the fabric had been grown in that shape.

I called security that time. They talked to him. He claimed he was just ""prototyping"" and wanted the Creative Director’s eye. They let him off with a warning.

I should have fired him then. God, I should have fired him then. But I was arrogant. I thought he was just a socially awkward weirdo who worshiped my taste. I’m used to people being obsessed with me; it comes with the job title.

The turning point was last Tuesday. It was late, past 10:00 PM. The heating in the building shuts down to a low hum after eight to save energy, and my office was freezing. I was wrapped in my coat, shivering, trying to approve a layout for a show in Milan.

I realized I had left my scarf in the car.

I looked at the corner of my desk. There was a box there. It had appeared while I was in a meeting earlier that day. I hadn't opened it.

Desperation makes you do stupid things. I opened the box.

Inside was a scarf. It was the same white material as the swatch, but thicker, layered. It looked heavy, but when I lifted it, it weighed nothing. It rippled over my hands like water.

I hesitated. But the chill in the room was biting through my blouse. I told myself I would just wear it for an hour. Just to get warm.

I draped it around my neck.

The sensation was immediate and overwhelming, and it felt like it was generating its own heat. It settled against my skin with a weight that felt reassuring, like a firm hand resting on my shoulder. It was incredibly comfortable.

I went back to work. The shivering stopped. I felt a strange sense of calm wash over me, a lethargy that smoothed out the jagged edges of my stress. I typed, reviewed, and drank my coffee.

An hour passed. I reached up to adjust the scarf, to loosen it a bit.

It didn't move.

I pulled harder. The fabric seemed to have adhered to my skin like... suction. It clung to the curve of my throat.

Panic flared in my chest. I went to the mirror in my private bathroom.

The scarf looked normal. But when I hooked my finger under the edge and pulled, my skin pulled with it. It was tight. Second-skin tight.

I clawed at it. I dug my nails in. The fabric was incredibly strong. It didn't tear. It barely stretched. Finally, with a grunt of effort, I managed to peel it away from my nape. There was a sound—a wet, velcro-like tearing sound.

I threw the scarf across the room. It landed in a heap, and for a second—I swear to God—it twitched. It slowly settled into a flat pool of white, but that initial movement looked like a muscle relaxing.

My neck was red and raw. I touched the skin. It felt sticky. There was a residue on me, a clear, odorless slime that dried quickly into a flaky white powder.

I washed my neck for ten minutes, scrubbing until I bled. I threw the scarf in the trash compactor in the hallway.

I didn't sleep that night. I felt heavy. My limbs felt like they were moving through syrup. I had dreams of being wrapped in a cocoon, suspended in the dark, while something massive and many-legged picked delicately at my clothes.

The next day, I came in determined to terminate his employment. I didn't care about HR protocols. I was going to throw him out of the building myself.

But I couldn't find him. He wasn't in the archive. He wasn't in the break room.

I sat at my desk, trying to focus. around 1:00 PM, I ordered a steak for lunch. Rare. I needed the iron. I felt depleted, hollowed out.

I was eating at my desk, slicing the meat, when I felt it again. The gaze.

I looked up. The glass walls of my office look out over the main design floor.

He was standing on the far side of the room, behind a row of mannequins. He was perfectly still, watching me.

I froze, a piece of steak halfway to my mouth.

He was staring at my jaw. As I chewed, slowly, his jaw moved. He wasn't eating anything. He was mimicking the motion. A rhythmic, grinding rotation of the mandible. His mouth was closed, but the muscles in his cheeks bunched and released in perfect sync with mine.

He looked bigger. His suit, usually baggy, looked tighter across the shoulders. His neck looked longer.

I dropped my fork. The clatter echoed in the silence of my office.

He stopped chewing. He smiled. This time, he opened his mouth.

His teeth were different. I had seen them before—normal, flat human teeth. Now, they looked sharper. Pointed. And there were gaps, as if his gums were receding to make room for something else.

He raised a hand and pointed at his own neck. He rubbed it, mimicking the way I had scrubbed my skin the night before.

Then he turned and walked away. His walk was wrong. It was too smooth. His upper body didn't bob. He just glided, his legs moving in a blur that my eyes couldn't quite track.

I locked my office door. I called security and told them to revoke his badge. I told them he was harassing me. They said they would escort him out the moment they saw him.

They never saw him.

Fast forward to tonight.

It’s the end of the quarter. I had to stay. I told myself I was safe. We have keycard access, security patrols, cameras. I’m on the forty-second floor. No one gets up here without a pass.

By 9:00 PM, the office was deserted. The cleaning crew had come and gone. The lights were dimmed to the emergency track lighting, casting long, skeletal shadows across the rows of desks.

I was packing up. I had my bag on my shoulder. I had my hand on the door handle.

It wouldn't turn.

I frowned and jiggled it. Locked. But it doesn't lock from the outside.

I looked through the glass wall.

The main floor was dark, but the moonlight from the floor-to-ceiling windows illuminated the room in a cold, blue wash.

The room looked... different.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. The air seemed hazy, shimmering. I squinted.

There were lines connecting the desks.

Fine, glistening threads stretched from the corners of the cubicles to the ceiling. They crisscrossed the room, creating a complex, geometric geometry. 

And in the center of the room, sitting on top of the reception desk, was the Archivist.

He was crouched. Not sitting. Crouched. His knees were pulled up to his chest, his arms resting on them, and he was naked.

I recoiled, stumbling back from the glass.

He turned his head. His eyes caught the light. They reflected it back like a cat's eyes, a bright, chilling green.

He hopped down from the desk. He didn't make a sound. He landed on all fours and stayed there.

""Open the door!"" I screamed, my voice cracking. ""I’m calling the police!"" despite knowing he couldn’t hear me

He stood up then. Slowly. His spine uncurled with a sickening popping sound, like knuckles cracking underwater. He was impossibly tall. His limbs had elongated. His arms hung down past his knees. His skin was stark white, and I could see dark veins pulsing underneath it.

He walked toward my office door. He wasn't wearing clothes, but he wasn't naked, exactly. His skin was covered in a fine, downy white hair. And around his waist, trailing behind him like a train, was a mass of that same white fabric. It was coming out of him. It was spinning from spinnerets located at the base of his spine.

He pressed his face against the glass.

""The tensile strength is insufficient,"" he whispered. The glass is soundproof, but I heard him. I heard him because his voice wasn't coming from the air; it was vibrating through the floor, through the walls.

""You are fragile,"" he said. ""You break. You tear. You rot.""

""Go away!"" I yelled, backing up until I hit my desk. I grabbed my letter opener. It was dull, useless. I remembered the pocket knife I keep in my drawer for opening fabric bales. A heavy-duty, serrated folding knife. I grabbed it. I flicked it open.

""I can fix you,"" he murmured. ""I can wrap you. Keep you fresh. The juice stays inside when the casing is tight.""

He reached for the door handle, and just pushed.

The metal lock snapped with a loud bang. The door swung open.

I ran.

My office has two doors. One to the main floor, one to a side corridor that leads to the freight elevators. I sprinted for the side door.

I burst into the hallway. It was dark.

I took three steps and stopped.

The hallway was a maze.

Invisible threads were strung across the corridor at various heights. Ankle level. Waist level. Neck level. They were so fine they were almost invisible, catching the emergency light only when I moved my head.

I turned to go back, but he was already in the doorway of my office.

He wasn't walking anymore. He was skittering. He moved across the wall, his hands and feet adhering to the drywall, his body defying gravity. He looked like a pale, distorted gecko.

""Don't run,"" he hissed. ""Movement degrades the fibers.""

I had no choice. I dove forward, trying to go under the waist-high threads.

I miscalculated.

A thread caught my upper arm, and It went through my blazer, my blouse, and into my skin like a hot wire.

I screamed and yanked my arm back. Blood sprayed.

The smell hit him instantly.

He stopped moving, and froze on the wall. His head snapped toward me. He inhaled deeply, a rattling, wet sound.

""Leakage,"" he moaned. ""Precious fluids.""

He launched himself off the wall.

He swung. A line of silk shot from his wrist—yes, his wrist—and adhered to the ceiling light fixture. He swung toward me in a pendulum arc.

I scrambled on the floor, crawling on my stomach to avoid the tripwires. I could hear him landing behind me. The sound of his bare feet slapping the linoleum was wet and heavy.

I reached the corner. The freight elevator was twenty feet away.

Something wrapped around my ankle.

It was soft, sticky, and incredibly strong. I kicked out, but the more I struggled, the tighter it got. I was being reeled in.

I was dragged backward across the carpet. I clawed at the floor, my nails breaking.

He was standing over me.

Up close, he was a nightmare of biology. His face was still human, but distorted. His eyes were huge, unblinking. His jaw hung slack, revealing rows of needle-teeth. And the smell... it was the smell of the protein shake, amplified a thousand times. Bleach and rot.

""Still,"" he commanded.

He began to spin me.

He used his hands, moving with blinding speed. He pulled ribbons of white silk from his abdomen and wound them around my legs. He lifted me up like I was a doll. He spun me. The silk tightened, binding my ankles together, then moving up to my knees.

I slashed out with the knife.

I cut his arm.

It bled a thick, white goo.

He shrieked—a sound that wasn't human. It was a high-pitched chittering that hurt my teeth. He dropped me.

I hit the floor hard. My legs were bound, but my upper body was free.

I slashed at the silk on my legs. The serrated blade sawed through the fibers. It was tough, like cutting through Kevlar, but the knife was sharp.

""You are damaging the merchandise!"" he screamed. He was backed against the wall, clutching his wounded arm. The white goo was bubbling, hardening into a scab almost instantly.

I freed my legs. I scrambled up.

He lunged.

I didn't run away. I stepped into him. I’m a Creative Director. I deal with problems head-on.

I drove the knife into his shoulder.

It sank in with a sickening squelch.

He roared and backhanded me. I flew across the hall and hit the opposite wall. The wind was knocked out of me.

But he didn't follow. He was staring at the knife handle sticking out of his shoulder. He looked confused.

""Imperfection,"" he whispered.

I didn't wait for him to process it. I ran for the elevator, and hit the button.

The doors seemed to take an eternity to open. I could hear him behind me. The sound of skittering, and of wet slapping.

I turned around.

He was on the ceiling. He was crawling right above me, his head rotated 180 degrees to look at me upside down. He opened his mouth, and a stream of liquid silk shot out.

The elevator doors pinged.

I threw myself inside. The silk stream hit the closing doors, splattering against the metal like gunshot.

I hammered the ""Lobby"" button.

As the doors closed, I saw him drop from the ceiling. He landed in a crouch right in front of the gap. He reached in with a long, pale hand.

The doors clamped shut on his fingers.

And he just pulled.

The metal doors groaned. They started to bend. He was prying the elevator doors open with his bare hands.

I shrank back into the corner, holding my pocket knife, praying the mechanism was stronger than him.

The elevator jolted. It began to descend.

There was a sickening crunch as his fingers were sheared off by the floor plate.

Four long, pale, severed fingers fell onto the elevator floor. They were twitching.

I watched them twitch all the way down to the lobby. They didn't stop moving until the doors opened again.

I ran. I ran past the sleeping security guard at the front desk, screaming my head off. I ran out into the street. I didn't stop until I saw a police cruiser.

Now I’m here.

The police went upstairs. They were gone for twenty minutes.

When they came down, the lead officer looked at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance.

""Ma'am,"" he said. ""There’s no one up there.""

""Did you see the webs?"" I asked, grabbing his arm. ""The threads? The blood?""

He shook his head. ""The office is pristine. Cleaning crew must have done a hell of a job. There's no blood. No webs. No giant spider-man.""

""But the fingers!"" I pointed to the elevator. ""The fingers on the floor!""

He sighed. ""We checked the elevator. It’s clean.""

""He took them,"" I whispered. ""He took them back to reattach them.""

""Ma'am, we found a pocket knife on the floor of the hallway. It has... white paint on it. And your own blood. We think maybe you cut yourself and had a panic attack.""

They handed me my knife in an evidence bag. The blade is coated in a dried, white crust. They think it's paint.

I know it's not paint.

I’m looking at the elevator right now. The officers are talking to the night guard, getting my statement.

The indicator light for the freight elevator just lit up.

It’s moving.

It’s coming down.

I’m looking at the glass doors of the lobby. Beyond them is the city, dark and full of alleys.

I have my phone. I have my knife.

I’m leaving. I’m not going home. He knows where I live.

I’m going to a hotel. One with no carpet, high traffic, and bright lights.

The elevator just dinged.
