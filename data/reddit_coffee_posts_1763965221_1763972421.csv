_______________________________________________________

Emily woke up in a creepy old room, it looked like it belonged to a woman.

‘Ugh, my head hurts ‘.

She felt as if someone hit her in the head with a metal pipe.

She stood up and looked around.

She saw a revolver next to her on the ground, there was still smoke coming out of the revolver's barrel.

“...”

‘Did I shoot myself?!’.

‘What the hell happened here?’.

She stood up and observed the room.

She walked to the body mirror and studied her reflection.

A young lady with fair skin, black hair, one red eye, and a rose eye patch covering her right eye and she was wearing a feysacian dress.

“Ugh, great I still have one eye”.

She walked to the bed and sat on it, trying to remember what happened.

‘ This body belonged to an orphan girl, she is also a sanguine descendant, she came to this abandoned house and shot herself’.

‘How did she get that gun anyways?’.

Emily observed the room one more time.

‘This place creeps me the fuck out’.

She stood up, looked at the revolver, thought for a moment and picked it up.

‘Who knows, I might need it’.

She walked up to the door, looked back one more time and left.

The rest of the house was pretty much the same as the room, eerily quiet, lots of spider webs and broken walls.

Emily left the house, walked down the street, she felt as if people were staring at her.

She took a right turn and entered an alleyway and leaned on the walls.

‘Ugh, This is too much for me (╥﹏╥)’.

She heard someone's footsteps coming her way.

‘Was I being followed?’ she asked herself.

“Halt!”, a man in official clothes shouted.

“Crap”. Emily cursed.

“State your sequence and faction”, He said.

‘Huh, he isn't arresting me ?’ she wondered.

“ Uhh, I'm sequence 9 of the apothecary pathway, as for the faction I don't know what u r talking about”.

“Are you a rogue beyonder?”

“ Uhm, yeah?”.

‘Why am I telling him this, am I dumb?’

She was about to run when he said

“Relax, I'm not going to arrest you or anything”.

“Really?”

“Yeah, You just have to follow me to register you at caelasteria beyonder’s department”.

“Sure...”, Emily was a little skeptical about it, but had no other choice.

They left the alleyway and returned to the street.

Emily curiously asked the so called officer as they walked to the beyonder department.

“How did you know I was a beyonder?”

He stared at her for a moment and asked, “Uhh...Spirit vision”

“...” 

The silence was loud.

‘Yeah…, I'm just a dump’.

They walked in silence until they reached their destination.

As soon as they reached the department, the officer asked, “ By the way, are you knowledgeable in biology and chemistry?”

Emily was startled by this question, and frankly answered, “ yeah, I know a thing or two”.

‘ Good thing is that the original owner of this body was studying biology and chemistry before committing suicide'.

'What made her commit suicide anyways?’.

Her train of thoughts was interrupted by the officer's voice telling her to come in.

They entered the department and walked to a lady sitting behind a register.

The lady asked with a bright smile on her face, “ Welcome to caelasteria beyonder's department, how can I help you ?”

The officer answered, “ My friend here wants to register as an official beyonder”.

The lady handed Emily a pen and an application to fill.

Emily filled the application after some time and handed it back to the lady 

“Emily D'arcy, will you join a faction or stay on your own ?”, asked the lady.

Emily thought for no more than three seconds and answered, “ I would like to join a faction”.

“Natrus, correct ?”

“Yup”.

“Then please go take the test while I bring your license”.

“Ehh?”.

Emily looked at the officer with a confused expression.

“What? You said you are knowledgeable in biology and chemistry, it will be fine”.

‘...I fell for his trap!’.

The officer pointed at the laboratory and informed her that the test is to be taken there.
Emily walked to that room, took a deep breath, and opened the door.


“Here goes nothing”.

As soon as she entered the room, she was immediatly greeted by an old man who had scholarly vibes.

""Welcome to my modest lab, I assume you are here for the naturus test, correct ?”

The lab was anything but modest, even Emily was confused for a sec.

“Yes, I would like to take the test”.

The old man nodded and gestured to her to come in and have a seat.

He then walked to a wooden table and asked the young woman,
“Tea or coffee ?”

“Coffee would be great”, she replied

He then poured the coffee in a porcelain cup and handed it to her.

He then sat facing her and said, “ The test is divided into two parts, academic and practical “.

Emily listened carefully as he continued to explain, “ You only get one hour to finish both, any questions?”

Emily shook her head, indicating that she had no questions.

“ Great”, he then stood up, picked up a piece of paper and a few test tubes with a bunch of sealed bottles.

He put them in front of her and handed her what seemed to be the test paper and said while holding his hand watch, “ Your time starts…..now”.

Emily then stared at him for a couple of seconds.

""What's wrong?”, he asked.

She replied with a hint of embarrassment, “ uhh, would you mind lending me a pen?”

“You came to take a test without bringing a pen ?”

‘I didn’t even know that there was a test!, don’t give me that look’.

“Uhh, No?”, she replied.

He pulled out a pen from his pocket and gave it to her with a look that screamed “ Kids these days”.

Emily took the pen and didn't give much attention to the man’s expressions, wrote her name on the paper, and…

“Only one question?”

The question read as follows : 

“ Using the following , show how to differentiate between Monosaccharides and reducing disaccharides, taking into account that failing to write the steps would lead to failure”.

“Huh”.

‘ Ehh... it's not that bad’.

She observed the test tubes and the bottles, thought for a bit, and began with the test tubes.

‘ tube x and tube y and a bunch of compounds’

‘Let’s see, I'll make Benedict's reagent first’.

She began by dissolving 86.5g hydrated sodium citrate and 50g anhydrous sodium carbonate in 350mL distilled water, she then added 8.65g copper sulfate dissolved in 50mL water and dilute to 500mL.

She wrote the steps of preparing Benedict's reagent and focused on the tubes.

She stood up, approached the wooden table and picked up the vintage kettle that the man used to make her coffee.

She poured some hot water in the beaker, put the two test tubes in the hot water, and dropped a few drops of the reagent she prepared.

Soon after test tube x’s colour turned into orange, while test tube y remained the same.

She returned to write the final steps and explained that test tube x turned orange due to copper (II) ions in the reagent reacting with the sugar’s aldehyde group, this turns copper (II) into copper (I).

While test tube y’s colour remained the same due to the presence of a ketone that locks the aldehyde group from reacting with copper (II).

“Done”.

The old man was observing this the whole time, he looked at his watch, and said in a pleased tone, “ Not bad, kid. I’m really impressed, most people take the whole hour to finish the test yet you completed it in 20 min”.

‘ One hour is a lot my guy, you should probably change that’. She lampooned.

Before she could speak he said, “ Welcome to Natrus, kid”.

He then called for someone, "" Aron, would you look at that? Lots of geniuses are joining Natrus as of late"".

'heh, geniuses'.

She bowed and excused herself and returned to the reception to receive her licence.

She received the licence, the officer congratulated her and showed her the way to Natrus dorm and showed her her room.

She opened the door using the key she was given by the lady and entered the room.

Emily didn't even bother to observe the room.

She closed the door, and laid on her bed.

‘Sigh, What a long day,....that instructor reminds me of my father, I already miss those days where all I did was slack off’, she thought as she was falling asleep from exhaustion.


end.

1p5bj0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Adra62/comments/1p5bj0x/a_totally_euphoric_story_trans/,A Totally Euphoric Story (Trans),"Heya, thank you for reading this! Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

One morning I was early for once and decided to bring a small tray of coffees from  the place next door because I was already grabbing one for myself. I just put them on the table and  said something like hey if anyone wants one grab it. People were surprisingly excited which  honestly made my entire day. Next week I did it again without thinking. And then again . Now somehow I have become the unofficial caffeine provider of the entire floor and I dont  know how to stop without feeling like a villain in a cartoon. The funny part is that people now track my movements like migrating birds. If I walk in with a paper bag someone literally goes  oh yes its coffee day. If I walk in empty handed you can feel this tiny wave of collective sadness  hit the room. Last Wednesday a coworker looked at me and said you abandoned us with  a smile that was joking but also maybe not fully joking. I swear I never signed up for this level of emotional responsibility over adult humans and their espresso consumption. I know I could just  stop and everyone would survive but theres a small part of me that enjoys the chaos of it all.  Sometimes I delay going out just to see who will crack first and ask if Im planning a coffee run . And maybe it sounds silly but these little moments made the office feel more friendly than it was before.  Still I am looking for a graceful exit strategy before I become a full time barista with no pay .

I’m in my 30’s, sober, artsy, and witchy. Meeting like minded people is challenging around here, so i was wanting to see if there’s any sort of interest in a meet up for the odd ducks that doesn’t involve drinking?
Like, looking for people with similar niche interests that are hard to connect with others over. So like, some examples would be taxidermy, antique medical equipment/tools, rocks, plants, and obviously there are infinitely more possibilities for hobbies/interests, but these are some off the top of my head.
Idk, the economy sucks and everything is expensive. So i figured if the interest is there we could plan for a coffee shop or something similar. 

Obviously the goal of this is for people to find like minded people, and make friends and whatnot. Also, socially awkward would be more than welcome (I’m super awkward). 
If this takes off in any capacity maybe we can shoot for it once to twice a month vs a one off/sporadic thing.
Again, this is to gauge interest. Please respond if you’d enjoy something like this and maybe mention some of your niche hobbies/interests? ",3,1763971841.0,Modesto,0,1.0,False

Or maybe it's just that I don't think this dating thing will get easier once I enter my 30s, it's already hard enough in my late 20s hahaha.

So while we can still say we met during our 20s, let's do something different and interesting. I know everyone is burned out na on this endless online dating, ghosting, etc. and ubos na lahat ng swerte natin for an organic meet-up.

I'm thinking, let's make up an artificial ""meet-cute"" story haha. If you're interested, I will be in a coffee shop somewhere and meet me there. If you see me and type mo ako, approach me, if not, pretend you never saw this post. Message me and I will be telling you where I will be and what I will be wearing that day, and a ""code"" to tell me para alam kong dito ka galing haha.

But it's still cool parin naman if you wanna get to know each other online, just please, no ghosting and be communicative.  

So anyway, about me:

* I prefer to stay in, lazy days, spa weekends, and hindi ako sporty, but I am active enough naman siguro for your active hobbies like hiking, pickleball, badminton, or whatever. Di lang ako marunong so you have to teach me hahahaha
* Working professional
* Has many geeky hobbies (sort of, pero medyo busy na ngayon sa isa which is gaming haha)
* Somewhere north of Metro Manila. Pero I'll be around QC siguro for the meet up hahaha
* The rest is for you to judge and/or find out

About you: (hopefully)

* Cute, sweet, nice
* Petite (preference, sorry, so I could spoil you in ways a tall guy could, and I know I'm not that tall myself)
* Major turn on: career-oriented, I am relatively successful so I hope you are too (oversell nanaman hahahaha)

I am moving from Iceland to Alicante in January. I will be studying in a school there for 12 weeks (3 months). I do not plan on working, just learning the most beautiful language in the world. I've been there many times and it's one of my fav cities.

I am looking for a studio to rent, there are many rooms available I can see, using idealista but not so many studios or completely private rooms with a private bathroom etc. 
Now this is low season for tourism, can any locals recommend any sites for me or a renting agency? 

I am a 30 year old female. I do not smoke and rarely drink, not much of a party person, I have good recommendations from previous landlords and also house/pet sittings I've done around the world. I like to keep things clean and quiet around me. 

Any help would be appreciated also if anyone is looking for a friend, I like hiking, going to coffee shops, chill at the beach, go for a drink. 
I don't know anyone in Alicante but my brother and fiancee + baby niece are in Bilbao.

I never asked for money, sometimes she’d bring coffee or a little gift.

My manager was polite but later said the client seemed distracted and we have to redo the meeting. Now Im worried I messed up my chances.  
  
When Lena came back all smiles, I told her we needed boundaries. I said I like Mia and Im fine helping sometimes with notice, but I cant be her automatic backup sitter and she cant just show up at dawn and drop her kid on me, especially when she knows I have something big for work. I said it was my fault for not setting this boundary earlier, but I have to protect my job.  
  
She got mad and said I dont understand how hard it is to be a single mom, that I dont have “real responsibilities” because I don't have kids, and that a real friend would help in an emergency. Later she texted that I basically abandoned her and Mia and told some neighbors Im heartless.

1p5bbay,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingsPhilippines/comments/1p5bbay/wedding_suppliers_tier_list_grooms_version/,Wedding Suppliers Tier List - Groom's version,"Henlo! With the big day now done and dusted I can share my experiences with our own suppliers. This is me the groom and my wife might make her own post. 


S Tier

The George Catering - We had our first tasting in 2024, several tastings in between and of course the big day itself. Every single time we met with them we were treated exceptionally well. Working with Chef Marc feels like having one of your close friends design your menu with you. Every little thing we commented on during the tastings he and the team addessed.  The result was on our big day everyone was gushing about the food. His team is also great to work with! With them talaga I felt like it they took our event as if it was theirs too.

Altitud Coffee - Who serves pour over coffee during an event? We do. Extremely easy to work with and the personalized cups really added to the vibe of the event. Goes without saying that when you're known by friends and family as the coffee nerd then your coffee supplier has a high bar to clear. They certainly did that.

A Tier

Windsong - Excellent venue, good value for money. Johnny has been a very accomodating with everything.

Big Red Bag - Gie has made everything so easy for us. We had hiccups during the day itself but nothing that our guests noticed. Gie really reflects the same values that we do so it was very easy to work with her and her team. My catch phrase for the past few weeks was ""I don't know please ask Gie"" that's how much we depended on her and she certainly delivered.

The Inn - The suite was large accomodating. It felt like staying at a friend's guest house, it felt very homey in a good way. Breakfast from Sinta restaurant is also good. The little touches like chocolates and wine when we got back to the room is definitely appreciated as well. 

String Colors - Our band knocked it out of the park. Joel and his team delivered their versions of our selected songs and it set the mood for our dinner and ceremony.

Moxx De Vera - Exactly the type of host we wanted. Someone who can keep the energy while still sounding classy. He has that typical southie type of humor and talking style which is familiar to us and that made him a great fit. Did he have mistakes? Sure he did but he recovered well.

Magazine booth by FA - Photos came out well and the setup looked really good! We didn't really interact with them much thanks to Gie but I'm happy with this supplier and have no complaints.

Tagaytay String Lights - I'm not sure how Gail pulled it off with the budget we had but the venue looked stunning. We had a few meetings with her lang to discuss the vibe we wanted and she knew what to do from there. 

Tagaytay Flowers (Gudz) - He did our ceremony styling and it was top notch. We only met once to discuss the overall vibe and he delivered easy peasy. May discount pag pogi yung groom 😂 

Fa-Mana - Last minute supplier for us and they delivered well. Good selection of drinks and our guests were properly lubricated for the after-party. There was one round of shots that wasn't well liked by people but other than that it was all good.


B Tier 

Exclusively His - They made two suits for us. Had several fittings to get it just right. We had several issues that took a couple of fittings to get resolved. Good value for money though and I'm very happy with my suit and their selection of fabrics is good. 


C Tier

Mainstage lights and sounds - Played the wrong version of our music eventhough our coordinator provided the actual files. Playlist for after-party didn't match our selected playlist. Our cooridnator provided all the needed stuff they just did their own thing I guess.


Unrated: 

Cliff House - They provided our kawn games but wasn't fully utilized because of the weather. They came and setup on time though so good job.",2,1763971261.0,WeddingsPhilippines,0,1.0,False

I don't really think this is common at all and never thought it would happen to me. I think this goes above the normal harmless scams I've encountered into straight up a shakedown/extortion.

I was alone walking back from grabbing some coffee by the river in HCMC D1 about a block or 2 off of Bui Vien Walking Street just before noon when the area is pretty dead.. I don't know the area super well, but I felt like at the time I was in a super safe spot... Honestly until today I thought all of HCMC has been super safe.

As you know, people leave shit in the sidewalk all the time, so I tried to shuffle in between the sidewalk and traffic and it was wet/slick on the slanted curb, so I slipped. 

This guy who wasn't in the shop comes up saying that I damaged his tree when I slipped (I think this is what was said after what transpired)? I definitely landed in some ""trees"" it was more like a few small plants that were fine. I stupidly stuck around for a second to make sure the plants were ok and he started to make a call.. This guy starts following me asking for 5 million VND for damages to his tree.. 

I started walking towards my hotel thinking that he would leave me alone. I just kept telling him to call the tourist police if he wants money, tourist police. He keeps grabbing me, but I'm not a small person so in that moment I didn't really feel intimidated or that he could do anything to me.

I walked right by the shortcut I knew back to my hotel, it was down an alley and he was following me so I didn't know what would happen if I went out of sight of the public... Really glad I did this looking back because I didn't even really feel intimidated or in danger yet.

This whole time I was scanning around looking for tourist police or maybe even someone that spoke english. It was the one time I didn't see many foreigners when its been crawling with them every time I've walked before.

This guy was still 10 feet behind me on his phone when 2 other guys pop up on a motorbike. One jumps off the back and now the first guy and him are grabbing me and the driver is on the motorbike.

This is in broad daylight in an area I thought was very safe and now 2 of the 3 people are grabbing me and I couldn't understand what they were saying. The guys who showed up were a lot bigger than the first guy. I've been training  for 10 years and still didn't really feel scared this whole time physically, but I didn't know what to do without resorting to violence.

They started trying to get me onto the motorbike... Pointing at it and grabbing me, they definitely werent really going to be able to move me, but I knew not to swing... That was when I knew they werent going to leave me alone and the alarm bells really started ringing.

I was mostly worried about them trying to steal my bag or phone while they kept grabbing me so I just sorta stopped when I reached Phạm Ngũ Lão; there were a lot of people around so I didn't feel like I would get stabbed at least... I tried speaking to a few people, but they seemed scared of these guys and nobody wanted to get involved. They just keep translating you need to pay me for the tree.

I have heard stories about punching locals not going well and there were 3 of them so I really didn't know what to do. I pointed at the translate (I didn't want to bring out my own phone) I told them I didn't have 5 million dong. Quickly I got them down to 100,000, paid them and then it was over.. I didn't even care about $3-$4, it's more so the principle behind all of this.. I don't know if these people are connected to local police or how corrupt people are here, so I figured it was just better to pay the least amount possible that would get them to leave me alone.

I don't know how organized this group was or if it was just extremely opportunistic.. The situation quickly went from 1 to 3 people. Maybe I was in way more danger than I even realize.. I feel like it could have been a lot worse if I didn't immediately start walking towards the main roads or went down an alley. Stay safe guys..",5,1763971144.0,VietNam,0,1.0,False

California I swear,"Like many others, the taxes and COL have grown too much in the last few years here in LA, plus I’d really like to own a home someday that isn’t 1.2mill for 900sq. Ft. and surrounded by smog (asthma/allergies), and being 45F and single income doesn’t go very far here and rent is only getting worse. 

I work in a creative industry, mostly remotely or with a couple months travel, and am self employed. That knocks a couple places out because of taxes - New Mexico for instance is very unfriendly for this type of structure, so is Oregon. (Colorado and NC are decent - better than Ca anyway). 

I would love to find a place that has a creative/entrepreneurial vibe to it, or at least third spaces like coffee shops and book store hangouts -not just breweries and drinking culture. Big fan of being surrounded by people in a park or library reading a book but not really having to socialize. I also go to a lot of movie related events and screenings, book clubs, gaming stuff, weird fantasy events and ren faires….I’m not really looking for a hip/cool neighborhood so much as cozy/nerdy/not inundated with kids. 

I grew up in upstate NY and while I love half of the year there being in the woods and hills, I’m deeply affected by SAD with low sunlight hours in fall/winter. Also the sense of being stuck because of snow unable to get anywhere. 

I also lived in East Nashville for a stretch in the early 2000s, and while I loved it the humidity in the summer was really too intense for me and I’m definitely the type to think I’m fine and then pass out from the heat.  Also lived in Phoenix for a stint and that dry heat thing doesn’t really hold up over 100 degrees IMO.  SoCal of course is the ‘unicorn weather’ — but I’d much prefer some seasonal changes, as long as the sun doesn’t disappear for weeks at a time and the snow/cold doesn’t last 5 months out of the year. I love everything about the PNW look and cold humidity doesn’t bother me, but I feel like I’d wither and die up there from lack of sun.

I’d say I’m outdoorsy, but it’s more the daily walk in the hills and the occasional hike, camping 3-4 times a year in a national or state park, and a lot of leisurely biking. I’m not really one for skiing or extreme hiking. I find I want to be immersed in or be by nature rather than conquering some mountain in $900 of arcteryx gear and being wet or in the freezing cold.

While Denver seems like it might be a good fit, I do wonder if it’s worth moving there if you’re NOT into skiing and winter sports. I do love being surrounded by the mountains here and being able to drive up the Angeles crest, just seeing a lot of nature around is important to me. 

Some amount of diversity would also be nice and I’m also fine with a smaller size city as long as you can reach a decent mid-sized airport in any season in at least 90 minutes. 

Any ideas? I feel like I’ve exhausted all of mine - I could sacrifice more on the greyness or humidity side, but don’t want to budge on the 5 months of winter or extreme heat side.

1p5b6r9,https://youtu.be/UjDI2oZLf4c,4 Very Scary TRUE Truck Stop Vanishing Horror Stories,"# ""See You Soon…"":

I had just turned twenty-two that summer—fresh out of college, restless, and ready to start a new life out west. My younger brother Tom, nineteen and always chasing a thrill, insisted on joining me for the cross-country drive from Boston to Los Angeles. We packed our battered old station wagon with everything we owned—clothes, books, half-broken guitars—and started west with the kind of blind optimism only siblings our age could have.

Tom was the energy in the car, always humming, always tapping the dashboard, always telling some ridiculous joke to keep the long miles from swallowing us whole. “If this thing breaks down,” he’d say, flicking the steering wheel with a grin, “I’ll thumb a ride with the first cowboy who stops. Bet he’ll have better stories than you.”

By the time we reached Wyoming, the world had stretched into nothing but open sky, sun-bleached plains, and distant mountains that looked painted on. Around midday, we pulled into a truck stop near Fort Bridger—rows of big rigs lined up like patient giants, a diner with chrome counters and sticky menus, a gift shop selling dusty maps and stale candy.

We grabbed sandwiches in the diner and walked back to the car, still joking, still laughing—completely unaware of the crack in our timeline about to split everything into “before” and “after.”

I turned the key. The engine sputtered, coughed, died.

Tom groaned, popped the hood, and bent over it with absolutely no plan. “Alternator, maybe? Or… something alternator-adjacent.” He gave me a helpless shrug. “We’re stuck.”

A few minutes later, footsteps crunched on gravel.

A man approached. Mid-forties, flannel shirt, jeans, a faded baseball cap pulled low. The kind of man you’d never remember in a crowd—a face worn by sun, long hours, and the loneliness of highways. His voice was calm, steady, almost too steady.

“Having trouble?”

Tom stepped back from the engine. “Yeah, car won’t start. Think it’s electrical.”

The man peered beneath the hood like he’d seen a thousand dead engines before. “There’s a parts shop ten miles up the road. I’m headed that way. I can drive you there—won’t take long.” He pointed to a red pickup a few yards away, tools scattered in the bed.

Tom looked at me, concerned but trusting. “I’ll go grab the part, come right back.”

Something about the man felt wrong. Not obvious—subtle. The way he kept his eyes on the engine, never on us. The way he spoke like he already knew what we’d say.

But we were stranded. And it seemed safer than waiting hours for a tow.

“Okay,” I said, though the word felt heavy. “Be quick.”

Tom hopped into the passenger seat of the truck and gave me a wave—carefree, confident, trusting the world the way nineteen-year-olds still can.

I watched the truck pull onto the highway, shrinking into the horizon.

Fifteen minutes passed. Then thirty.

I bought a soda. Walked the lot. Watched trucks rumble in and out. An hour crawled by, sticky and slow.

Worry settled in like cold water.

I asked a few truckers if they’d seen a red pickup leave. Most shook their heads. One older man with a tobacco-stained beard paused before answering.

“Haven’t seen him. But… folks disappear around here. Happens more than people like to admit.”

My throat tightened. “Disappear how?”

“Hitchhikers, travelers, tourists. They trust the wrong driver, and poof.” He tapped the side of his head. “Highways attract all kinds.”

He walked away, leaving a chill where he’d been standing.

By two hours, panic had its hands around my lungs. I ran inside the shop and told the clerk—a gray-haired woman with tired eyes—what happened.

“My brother left with a man in a red pickup for car parts, and they haven’t—”

“Red pickup?” she cut in, frowning. “Honey, I’ve been watching the lot all morning. I never saw one.”

“But—it was right outside.”

She let me use the phone. My fingers trembled dialing. I told the dispatcher everything. She told me to stay put.

Outside, pacing, I noticed something on the ground where the truck had been parked—a crumpled receipt.

Chains. Rope. Purchased that morning.

My stomach dropped.

When Deputy Harris arrived—a tall, serious man with windburned cheeks—I handed him the receipt. His jaw tightened.

“We’ve had cases like this,” he said quietly. “Young people accepting help. Then disappearing.”

“What cases?”

“Last year, kid on a motorcycle broke down. Driver offered him a ride to a parts store. Kid never came back. Bike turned up abandoned on a dirt road. No sign of him.”

My voice was barely a whisper. “That’s exactly what happened to Tom.”

The deputy sighed, looking out toward the endless highway. “These stops attract predators. Some of them drive long haul routes. They know the backroads, the timing, the blind spots.” He shook his head. “Once someone gets pulled into the wrong vehicle… they’re gone before anyone notices.”

I wanted to search, to run into the desert screaming Tom’s name. Harris insisted it wasn’t safe.

I didn’t feel safe anywhere.

That night, in a motel the sheriff arranged, I lay awake listening to the building breathe. Every sound felt like a warning. Every silence felt like an accusation.

The next day, they found Tom’s wallet tossed in a ditch five miles away. His ID still inside. Cash gone. No signs of a struggle. Just abandoned—like trash.

Weeks passed. Then months. Search crews combed ravines, fields, old service roads. Nothing.

Investigators eventually mentioned the same horror whispered across the interstate system—the “highway killers,” truckers who lived in the liminal spaces between states, picking up vulnerable travelers and leaving no trace. One FBI agent showed me a map dotted with red pins across the country.

“Your brother’s case matches the pattern,” he said gently.

I asked about the man. He shrugged helplessly. “They blend in with everyone else.”

One night, months later, the phone rang.

A man’s voice—muffled, low, almost amused.

“Your brother shouldn’t have trusted me.”

Click.

The call couldn’t be traced.

Years have passed. I still drive those highways sometimes, pulling into lonely truck stops and scanning the faces around me. Every red pickup makes my pulse stutter. Every stranger’s smile feels wrong.

Tom vanished into the spaces between mile markers—into the silence of the road, into the hands of a man who offered help with a calm voice and steady eyes.

The case remains open.

And somewhere out there, that man might still be driving, scanning the lots, looking for the next stranded soul who believes the world is kinder than it is.

Some roads take you where you want to go.

Others never let you come back.





# ""The Side Door"":

I pulled into the truck stop just off the interstate sometime after midnight, my fingers aching from gripping the wheel for the last three hours straight. Driving alone this late always made the darkness feel heavier, like it pressed in from every direction, but my friend Lisa had called earlier, saying she needed a ride after her shift at a diner down the road. We said we’d meet here, maybe grab something fried and terrible for us, then head home together. Simple enough.

The place was alive in that way only truck stops are at night—big rigs rumbling like giant mechanical animals, engines idling low, men in reflective jackets drifting between fuel pumps, the air thick with diesel fumes, hot asphalt, and the unmistakable smell of salty fryer oil. I parked near the entrance, checked my phone—no new messages—and headed inside.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead with a sickly hum, washing everything in a harsh, pale glow. The counter was sticky under my elbows, the kind of tackiness that never fully dries no matter how much someone wipes it. The woman behind it looked like she’d been awake for three shifts straight, eyes half-lidded as she refilled mugs for a couple of flannel-wearing men hunched over their phones. One of them barked a laugh so sudden and sharp it made me flinch.

I ordered a soda and moved to a window booth where I could watch the parking lot. Outside, headlights sliced through the dark as trucks pulled in and out, giant silhouettes shifting like walls. A few people wandered between them—mostly men, faces unreadable in the dimness, some carrying duffel bags, some just stretching their backs after long hours behind the wheel.

Lisa arrived about ten minutes later, shoulders slumped, her diner uniform wrinkled, hair tied back in a messy ponytail. The bells over the door jingled as she spotted me and slid into the booth, giving me that tired, crooked smile she always wore after a long shift.

“God, what a day,” she sighed, rubbing her eyes. “Customers wouldn’t stop coming. Half of them were rude, the other half clueless. Thanks for picking me up, Jen. If I had to sit on that busted bus again, I’d lose my mind.”

“You know I don’t mind,” I said, pushing the menu toward her. “Let’s eat and get out of here. Something about this place creeps me out.”

She glanced around, nodding. “Yeah… the vibe’s off. Anyway, burger and fries. Comfort food.”

We ordered from a younger waitress—“Karen,” according to her tilted nametag—who took our order with a practiced blankness that only comes from working late-night shifts under fluorescent lights.

While we waited, Lisa told me about a kid who spilled milk on himself and screamed like he’d lost a limb, and the table of tourists who left her a stack of pennies like it was some kind of joke. I told her about my classes and how my professor could make even the apocalypse sound boring. For a little while, it felt normal again—two friends catching up in a place built for transience.

Our food came steaming hot, and we dug in. We were maybe five bites in when the bell over the door jingled again, and a man walked in. Tall. Fifties. A plain, forgettable face under a worn trucker’s cap. Clothes clean but aged—jeans faded from years on the road, scuffed boots, a shirt that had been washed thin. He paused when he spotted us. Actually paused. His eyes lingered just a little too long.

He sat at the counter, ordered black coffee, but kept glancing over. Not quick looks. Not curiosity. Watching.

Lisa noticed it before I mentioned it. “He’s staring,” she whispered.

“Probably bored,” I muttered, shifting so I wasn’t fully facing away from him. But my stomach tightened.

He finished his coffee quickly, paid in crumpled cash, then—without hesitation—walked straight toward our booth. He stopped at the edge like he belonged there.

“Evening, ladies,” he said. His tone was polite but empty, like he’d practiced the line a thousand times. “Saw you two sitting alone. Figured you might want some company.”

“We’re good,” I replied, keeping my voice neutral. Firm, but not rude.

Lisa, ever the people-pleaser, gave him a gentle smile. “Just grabbing dinner before heading home. You a driver?”

He nodded and, without asking, pulled a chair from a nearby table and sat down at the end of our booth.

“Name’s Dave,” he said. “Been hauling cross-country for twenty years. Seen it all. Where you girls headed tonight?”

“Back to town,” Lisa answered, casual as ever.

“Town?” he echoed, leaning in slightly. “I go through there on deliveries sometimes. If you ever need help on the road—tire pressure, directions, whatever—my rig’s right out front. Big blue one with the silver stripe.”

I wanted to grab Lisa and walk out right then, but she kept chatting out of politeness. He answered her questions with short, bland stories—mountains in Colorado, beaches in Florida—but the whole time, his eyes stayed locked on her face like he was memorizing it.

After a few minutes, he stood abruptly. “Nice talking. Safe travels.”

The second he left, I exhaled hard. “Okay, that was creepy.”

“He was just lonely,” she said lightly. “Harmless.”

I didn’t argue, but my nerves didn’t settle.

We finished eating, paid Karen, and walked back into the night. The parking lot felt different now—quieter, colder, shadows stretching long between trucks. Lisa reached into her pocket and froze.

“Crap. My phone. I think I left it at the booth. Hold on.”

She jogged back inside. I leaned against the car, twirling the keys, watching her disappear behind the glass. Minutes passed. Then ten. My chest tightened.

I headed back inside. The tired counter woman—back from break—looked up lazily.

“Did you see a girl come in?” I asked.

“She grabbed something from where you were sitting,” the woman said. “Then went out the side door.”

A cold weight slid into my stomach.

The side door led directly into the truck lot.

I thanked her and pushed outside. The night air felt colder now. Sharp. Wrong.

Rows of semis stretched into the dark, engines murmuring like low growls. I called Lisa’s name.

No answer.

I walked between rigs, peering into shadows. At the far edge stood a truck exactly like Dave described—a big blue rig with a silver stripe, parked under a flickering light. The cab door was slightly open, a thin sliver of warm yellow spilling out.

Something inside me whispered run.

But I moved closer.

Voices. Muffled.

“Lisa?” I whispered.

I pulled the door wider.

She was inside—sitting on the edge of the sleeper bunk, relaxed, chatting—while Dave stood beside her holding a map. She wasn’t scared. She wasn’t tense. Just curious, oblivious.

“Oh, Jen!” she said, smiling. “Dave was just showing me his setup. It’s like a tiny apartment!”

Dave smiled too—but his eyes stayed cold. Glassy.

“Come on in,” he said. “Plenty of room.”

I climbed in because leaving her alone with him felt worse than going in.

The smell hit me first—cleaner mixed with something metallic. Something wrong. The cab was too tidy. Too neat. A rifle case in the corner. Papers stacked perfectly.

Dave moved behind me and shut the door.

Click.

Lisa pointed at the map, completely unaware. “He marked all these routes! Look at this one—”

I barely heard her. My eyes caught on a dark stain under the floor mat. Thick. Old. Too dark to be coffee.

“And this,” Dave said pleasantly, pulling a plastic bag from under the bunk.

Inside were women’s clothes. Folded.

Lisa’s smile faded. “What… what’s that?”

“Left behind,” he said simply. “Happens a lot.”

Something inside me snapped.

“Lisa. We need to go.”

Dave’s face changed then. Dropped its friendliness like a cheap mask.

“Sit down,” he said, voice lower.

Lisa stood. “What’s—”

He grabbed her arm.

“Sit.”

She yanked back, terrified now. “Let go!”

I didn’t think—I lunged for the door, shoved him hard, and tumbled out onto the gravel.

“RUN, LISA!”

She scrambled after me, but he caught her sleeve, jerking her back. Her scream tore through the night.

I sprinted toward the restaurant, hammering on the door. “HELP! CALL THE POLICE!”

The counter woman ran out with her phone already dialing. Drivers emerged from their rigs, confused but alert.

The police arrived fast—lights flashing, boots pounding gravel. They tore open Dave’s truck.

What they found inside wasn’t just stains.

It was women’s things—phones, wallets, jewelry. Items from states apart. A timeline hidden in plain sight.

Lisa wasn’t there.

Her purse was.

Dave insisted she left. But forensic teams found blood behind fresh paint. Hair stuck in a vent. A bracelet lodged under the bunk.

Days later, they linked him to missing women from truck stops across three states.

Weeks later, they found Lisa. Miles away.

Now, every time I pass that truck stop, I look at the blue glow of the rigs and think about how easily the road swallows people. How close I came to disappearing into the dark with her.

And how many others never got away.





# ""The Last Turnoff"":

The night I pulled into that truck stop off the interstate in northern Georgia, the air felt unusually still, like the world was holding its breath. I’d been driving for hours with barely any stops, trying to outrun the thoughts clawing at me after a rough week at home. My name is Kayla, and I was on my way to see an old friend in Rome—someone who always seemed to understand me when life got heavy.

The place was called the Flying Eagle, a truck stop that glowed like an island under the harsh yellow lights above the pumps. Big rigs idled in long, humming lines, their engines vibrating through the ground. A diner was attached, a squat building with fogged windows and a neon sign that flickered like it was tired of its own job.

I parked my little white sedan in the back lot, away from the semis, convinced it would be quieter there. I didn’t know then that this one small choice—this harmless, practical decision—would unravel the entire night.

Inside the diner, the air smelled like freezer-burned fries and burnt coffee. A waitress with tired eyes wiped at the counter with a damp rag leaving streaks behind. Her name tag said *Rita*. She gave me a weary smile.

“What can I get you, hon?” she asked, her voice soft, thick with the exhaustion of too many overnight shifts.

“Just a black coffee,” I said as I slid onto a stool. “And, uh… directions to Rome? I’m not familiar with the area.”

She poured my coffee into a foam cup and handed it to me. “Straight down I-75 about an hour. Watch for deer—they’ve been bad lately. Drivers hitting ‘em left and right.”

We talked for a moment about nothing—weather, long roads, how truckers kept the place alive at night. At the far end of the counter sat a man, maybe mid-forties. Scruffy beard, baseball cap pulled low, nursing a cup he barely seemed to sip. He kept glancing at the door like he was waiting for someone who was late… or someone who wasn’t supposed to show up at all.

He never looked directly at me, but something about him brushed up against my nerves—maybe too still, too quiet, too… watchful.

When I paid and stepped back outside, the night felt colder. The lot was mostly empty now, the chatter of earlier traffic fading. I tossed my backpack into the passenger seat, but the moment I closed the door, I realized something—I’d left my phone charger inside.

I sighed, locked up out of habit, and jogged back toward the diner. Rita noticed it on the counter as soon as I walked in.

“You almost forgot this,” she said. “Safe travels, hon.”

The way she said it—gentle, almost motherly—settled something in me. Calm. Normal.

But that feeling vanished the instant I returned to my car.

My driver’s seat was pushed back an extra few inches. My purse on the floor looked disturbed, the zipper half open. I froze. My mouth went dry.

Had I… left it like that?

No. I knew I hadn’t.

I opened it—wallet there, cards untouched. Nothing obvious missing. But someone had been inside. Someone had been sitting where I now stood, breathing in my space.

I scanned the lot. All quiet.

Too quiet.

I forced myself to start the car and pull out. I just needed to get back onto the highway. Get away from here. As long as I got moving, I’d—

My phone buzzed.

A text from an unknown number:  
**“Need help with that flat tire?”**

My heart knocked into my ribs. I didn’t have a flat tire.

In my rearview mirror, from a dark corner of the lot, a pair of headlights flicked on—slow, deliberate.

A black pickup eased out, dented and old, pulling onto the road behind me. Not tailgating. Not passing. Just… there. Matching my speed. Sitting in my blind spot like a shadow made of metal.

“Okay, Kayla,” I whispered to myself. “Stay calm.”

I took the next exit, hoping to lose him in the grid of a small town. The truck followed.

I pulled into a closed gas station, parking under a single streetlamp. The truck rolled to a stop across the street, engine rumbling, headlights off. Watching.

I dialed 911. My voice shook.

“H-hello? There’s a truck following me. I—I think someone messed with my car back at the Flying Eagle.”

“Ma’am, stay on the line,” the operator said. “Where are you right now?”

I gave the address. She started to say something, but the sound of a door slamming made my skin crawl.

The man from the diner stepped out of the truck.

Same cap. Same beard. Same dead-quiet presence.

He walked toward my car slowly, like he had all the time in the world.

I locked the doors. My breath fogged the glass.

He tapped on the window with two knuckles.

“You break down?” he asked, expression blank. “Saw you pull over funny.”

“Go away,” I snapped through the glass. “I’m calling the police!”

A thin smile crept across his face. “No need for that. I’m just tryin’ to help. You left your lights on back at the stop.”

“I didn’t.”

He gripped the door handle. Tried it gently. Then harder. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a thin tool—something meant for locks.

The clicking sound made my stomach drop.

The door yanked open.

Everything happened fast—a hand on my arm, the sting of pain as he twisted, the world tilting as he dragged me. My scream tore out but vanished into the empty night.

My phone fell, screen cracking on the asphalt. He stomped it out without even looking.

He pulled me into the cab of his truck and zip-tied my wrists so tight my fingers tingled. The inside reeked of old cigarettes and something metallic—coppery, sharp. Blood. Or something close to it.

Tools rattled behind the seat. Chains. Rope. A tarp.

“Where are you taking me?” I whispered.

“Away,” he said simply, starting the engine. “Quiet now.”

He drove down backroads, deeper into woods where the trees seemed to swallow the headlights whole. He hummed a song under his breath—tuneless, low, rhythmic, like something he’d hummed a thousand times before.

When he stopped, it was in front of a shed half-buried in brush, as if the forest had been slowly trying to reclaim it.

The inside smelled like dust and damp rot. A single bulb swayed, casting shadows that seemed to breathe. Dark stains marked the floor—too dark, too old to be dirt.

“Sit,” he ordered, pointing to a chair bolted to the concrete.

“Why me?” I whispered, the words slipping out before I could stop them.

“You were alone,” he said with a shrug. “Easy.”

He tied my ankles, stepped back, studied me like I was inventory.

“I do this sometimes. Pick people who won’t be missed right away.”

He left. Locked the door with a final, echoing clank.

Hours passed. Maybe a day. Time blurred. The bulb flickered. Sometimes footsteps paced outside. Sometimes humming drifted through the cracks.

When he returned, he tossed me a sandwich and water.

“Eat,” he said. “You’ll need strength.”

“For what?” My voice cracked.

He paused. His eyes gleamed.

“For the game,” he whispered. “I let you run. See if you make it.”

The laugh that followed was soft, breathy, but it hollowed me out.

When he left again, I bent over, working the plastic ties against my teeth until my gums bled. Pain sharpened me, fueled me. One hand slipped free. Then the other.

When he came back later, flashlight in hand, he nudged me with his boot. I stayed limp, breathing slow. He leaned closer.

I moved.

I grabbed a loose board near the chair and swung with every ounce of terror in my bones. It cracked against his temple. He dropped, groaning.

I ran.

The forest tore at me. Branches sliced my arms. My lungs burned. Behind me, his voice rose—ragged, furious:

“You won’t get far!”

I dove behind a fallen log, trembling as his flashlight beam swept inches from my face. Minutes stretched like hours. When he moved deeper into the woods, I slipped away, heading toward the faint glow of distant highways.

I burst out onto asphalt, waving down a passing car with what strength I had left.

Police searched the shed. It was empty. He was gone. No tools. No tarp. Just the chair. The ties. Silent proof.

My car was still at the Flying Eagle. Nothing missing. Just the seat pushed back.

They told me another man went missing days before from the same stop. Found later in a marsh. Ruled “overdose.” His family insisted he was clean. The scene didn’t add up.

Sometimes, late at night, I get texts from unknown numbers.

**“Missed you.”**

I delete them. But the fear stays like a bruise that never fully heals.

And every time I pass a truck stop, I check the mirrors. Twice. Sometimes three times.

Because out there somewhere, a man with a low baseball cap and dead eyes might be watching a door, waiting for the next person who looks “easy.”





# ""Westbound"":

I remember the exact feeling of pulling into that dusty truck stop off Interstate 45 in Texas—how the whole place shimmered in the evening heat like a mirage you’re not sure you should trust. The gravel crunched under the tires of the old pickup that dropped us off, and when Lisa and I climbed out, the warm air smelled like diesel, old rubber, and something metallic I couldn’t place at the time.

We were both nineteen, stupidly fearless, and hitchhiking to California like it was some rite of passage. Lisa, with her wild red curls and laugh that sounded like she’d never once been scared of anything, kept talking about touching the Pacific Ocean for the first time. Me? I just needed to run—from home, from expectations, from a life that felt too small for me to breathe in.

Three days on the road had turned us into dusty shadows of ourselves. We’d been eating greasy burgers, washing up in gas station sinks, and sleeping in the backs of pickups under thin blankets of early summer heat. But that night, our legs were tired and our throats were dry, and we needed rest—and maybe a ride heading west.

The place was called **Big Rig Haven**, though nothing about it felt haven-like. A crooked row of gas pumps glowed under buzzing lights. The diner’s neon sign flickered like it was blinking out a warning. And the semis in the lot sat like enormous sleeping animals, impossible to read, impossible to trust.

The old farmer who had given us our last ride waved once before pulling away, dust swirling behind his truck. Lisa stretched, cracking her neck. “Coffee,” she announced. “Or I’m gonna die right here in the parking lot.”

We slung our backpacks over our shoulders and walked toward the diner.

Inside, the air was a thick mix of fried eggs, burned coffee, and engine grease. A few truckers sat hunched at the counter, their faces lit by the yellow glow of the overhead lights. The waitress—gray hair pinned sloppily back, tired eyes that looked like they could read your entire life in one glance—poured us both coffees without being asked.

“You girls seem too young to be out here alone,” she said, sliding the mugs toward us.

Lisa flashed her usual smile. “We’re fine. Just headed west. You know anyone going that way?”

The waitress shook her head slowly. “Some of the folks here are good men. Others… aren’t. Just mind yourselves.”

I took a sip—too hot, bitter—and let my gaze drift around the diner.

That’s when I first saw **him**.

A tall bearded man in a flannel shirt sat alone in the corner booth. He didn’t look at anyone, didn’t touch his food—just stared at his plate like he was thinking of something else entirely. Something far away. Something cold.

I didn’t like the way his shoulders never moved. Like he barely breathed.

Lisa didn’t see him. She had already pulled out her folded map, spreading it over the table like she was plotting a treasure hunt. “If we get a ride to El Paso tonight,” she said, tracing the route with her finger, “we could hit New Mexico by sunrise.”

I nodded, but a sour heaviness had settled in my stomach.

The man from the booth stood, slid a few crumpled bills onto the table, and walked past us. He smelled faintly of metal and something faintly sweet—almost chemical. When he glanced at us, his eyes lingered for a second too long.

Too empty.

Lisa kept talking, oblivious, folding the map.

After a while, she pushed back her chair. “I gotta pee. Watch my stuff?”

She grabbed her backpack and wandered toward the back hallway.

I stayed behind, picking apart a napkin, trying to shake the uneasy feeling crawling up my spine.

Five minutes passed.

Ten.

I glanced at the restroom door.

Fifteen.

Finally I stood, walked toward the door, and knocked lightly. “Lisa? You good?”

Silence.

I opened the door. The restroom was empty—two stalls, a sink, a mirror streaked with old water stains.

“Lisa?” My voice sounded wrong. Too small.

Both stalls were empty. No backpack. No Lisa.

A cold tremor went through me. I hurried back to the counter.

“Did you see my friend leave?” I asked the waitress. “Red hair. Blue jacket.”

She frowned. “No, honey. I saw her go in there… but not out.”

My chest tightened.

I pushed through the diner door into the humid night, calling her name. “Lisa!”

The lot swallowed my voice.

Semis idled, engines rumbling like distant thunder. Huge shadows stretched between them. I walked aisle after aisle, knocking on doors, asking if anyone had seen her.

Most shook their heads. One man didn’t even look up—just muttered, “Ain’t seen nobody. Keep moving.”

Back inside, my hands trembling, I told the waitress, “She’s gone.”

This time, without hesitation, she picked up the phone and dialed the police.

“Happens sometimes,” a trucker at the counter said without looking at me. “Pretty girls get picked up fast. Maybe she found a ride.”

“No,” I said sharply. “She wouldn’t leave me.”

The police arrived twenty minutes later. A tired-looking officer with a mustache took my statement and Lisa’s description. He searched the lot with me, flashlight beam slicing through the darkness.

No signs. No screams. No struggle.

Just absence.

A shape cut out of my world.

Hours went by. Truckers came and went. The officer left after promising to patrol nearby highways.",1,1763970790.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I'm scared of disappointing people, I'm scared of rejection, I'm scared of leaving my house because what would people think of me? I feel like I'm being weighed down everytime I lay in bed.

Day by day I feel I'm becoming numb and then suddenly it's all like a tidal wave of self hate. I feel like I'm trapped, I know what I'm doing, I can see it clear as day.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

# **HART’S WAR — Episode 3**

### *“Collateral Heart”*

---

## **COLD OPEN — RECAP AS MEMORY**

Geneva at dawn is a color the Palais des Nations never seems to notice — a thin, hesitant blue brushing the lake, softening the alps, trying its best to make the city feel like a place that believes in peace. But inside the building, the fluorescent lights win every time.

Dr. Miranda Hart stands before the floor-to-ceiling window of Conference Room E-412, watching her own reflection rather than the morning. The air tastes like old coffee and printer heat. Nothing unusual. Nothing suspicious. Except that her simulation — **the model she never meant to become gospel** — is now the backbone of the next twenty years of managed conflict.

She had told them in the pilot that her model predicted an avoidable escalation in the northern corridor.  
She had told them in Episode 2 that someone had leaked her internal brief — the one outlining how the economic markets were tied to the war’s stabilizing influences.
She had told them last night, to no one in particular, that she no longer recognized the woman who kept making compromises in her own voice.

But in the Palais des Nations, telling the truth is a kind of performance. And everyone here performs for an audience of people who already know how the story ends.

The leak of her briefing — now hashtagged **#HartsWar** — hasn’t exploded publicly yet. But it has begun quietly, virally, in the diplomatic underground.  
A whisper.  
A rumor.  
A file forwarded five times by people who know to never forward anything.

And today, Miranda will discover just how deep that fracture runs.

The door opens behind her.

“Dr. Hart?” a voice asks — timid, terrified, one of the interns whose name she can’t remember because turnover here is faster than headline cycles.

“They’re ready for you.”

Miranda nods once, smooths her expression, and heads toward the committee room.
She walks like she has already accepted her fate.

**CUT TO TITLE.**

---

# **ACT I — THE MACHINE SETS THE AGENDA**

### **1. THE INQUIRY BEGINS**

The committee room is all glass and diplomatic smiles — curved rows of desks, country placards, interpreters behind soundproof booths, and the soft whir of institutional self-importance. Miranda steps into the center space like a reluctant defendant.

Ambassador Julian Lowell sits near the dais, immaculate as always, suit charcoal, eyes glinting with encouragement and warning in equal measure. He inclines his head at her — a private signal: *Stay calm. Say nothing unnecessary. Let them ask what they think matters.*

General Obi Kalu leans against the back wall, arms crossed, expression tight. He looks like he hasn’t slept, and he likely hasn’t — not since reading the leaked contents of her briefing. He hasn’t confronted her. He hasn’t avoided her. That neutrality alarms her more than either extreme.

The committee chair begins in the soft-spoken, serpentine tone only practiced bureaucrats can manage.

“Dr. Hart, thank you for your cooperation. As you know, we are simply conducting a preliminary review of internal document security.”

Miranda gives a small nod, hands folded.

“In particular,” the chair continues, “the unauthorized distribution of your conflict elasticity forecast.”

Julian shoots the chair a cold diplomatic smile that means: *You’re tiptoeing into territory that requires my permission.*

The chair adjusts tone immediately.

“This is not an investigation, of course. Merely fact-finding.”

Miranda knows better. This is a rehearsal — an institutional test run to see what she’ll do under pressure. Her model is now a geopolitical commodity. And she, by extension, is becoming one too.

She answers calmly. Smoothly.  
Her voice belongs to someone else.

“Of course. I’ll provide whatever I can.”

The questions begin, gentle at first — who had access, who she briefed, whether she noticed anything unusual. Miranda answers truthfully. She doesn’t mention the strange “phantom login” she saw in her metadata last week. She doesn’t mention the feeling of being watched in the hallways. She doesn’t mention the late-night message from an unknown address: **Your model is already out there. You might as well shape the narrative.**

Truthfully, she doesn’t know what to mention anymore.

### **2. LOWELL’S INTERFERENCE**

When the chair veers too close to insinuating that Miranda could have leaked the document herself, Julian Lowell rises — slowly, deliberately — and steps forward as though gravity bends nicer for him.

“With respect,” he says, “let’s not pretend a targeted attack on the institution is equivalent to negligence by one of its staff.”

The room chills.  
He continues:  

“Her model is now guiding the largest multilateral stabilization effort in years. Of course she’s a target. We should be protecting her, not interrogating her.”

Miranda feels something complicated in her chest — part gratitude, part dread, part recognition that Julian does nothing unless the optics benefit him.

She wonders what he stands to lose if she falls.

### **3. FIRST HINT OF SABOTAGE**

During a recess, Miranda slips into a hallway overlooking the courtyard. Alina Popescu — the NGO advocate who makes cynicism look like an armor set — appears beside her like an apparition.

“You know they’re going to blame you, right?” Alina says bluntly.

Miranda presses her palms to the railing. “For the leak?”

“For the war,” Alina answers. “They just haven’t realized it yet.”

Miranda turns sharply. “The model isn’t designed to—”

“Oh, save it,” Alina interrupts, holding up a hand. “I know what you think it does. I know what they’re using it to do. And what they’re going to claim you meant it to do.”

Miranda’s face pales.

Alina softens, just barely.

“Be careful who claims to protect you,” she murmurs, flicking her eyes toward Julian across the atrium. “That man plays twelve-dimensional chess, and you’re his favorite piece because you don’t know when you’re being moved.”

Miranda follows Alina’s gaze.  
Julian is watching her.  
Not possessively.  
Not suspiciously.  
Strategically.

The kind of gaze that picks the exact moment a person will break.

---

# **ACT II — CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM**

### **1. THE MODEL IS WEAPONIZED**

Hours later, Miranda returns to her office only to find Saif Rahman, the Economic Attaché, lounging in her chair, legs crossed, scrolling through her wall of monitors like it’s entertainment.

“Your forecasts age like wine,” he says. “Have you seen today’s currency futures? Market loves the leak. Thinks it confirms long-term stability.”

Miranda freezes. “Stability? They’re pricing in an extension of the war.”

Saif shrugs with infuriating charm. “Stability takes many forms. Some involve peace. Some involve… predictable conflict. Markets prefer the latter.”

He leans back, tapping a line of code on her screen.

“And now that your model’s partially public? Investors see it as a kind of weather report. Reliable. Cynical, but reliable.”

Miranda steps closer. “Saif… did you have anything to do with—”

“The leak?” he says, finishing the sentence with a smile that isn’t a smile. “Please, Dr. Hart. If I’d leaked it, the formatting would’ve looked professional.”

He rises, brushing imaginary lint from his suit.

“But whoever did leak it? They want your model to rule the narrative. And it’s working.”

As he leaves, Miranda notices something:  
One of her algorithms — the casualty elasticity module — is running.

She didn’t start it.  
She didn’t approve it.  
She didn’t authorize anyone to access it.

A chill runs through her.

---

### **2. GENERAL KALU BREAKS SILENCE**

General Obi Kalu appears in her doorway, shoulders heavy.

“You need to shut that module down,” he says quietly.

Miranda gestures helplessly. “I didn’t start it.”

“I know. That’s why you should shut it down.”

She does, hands shaking. Her fear feels childish, but Obi’s face tells her it isn’t.

He lowers his voice.

“If command sees that module running… they’ll interpret it as intent. As analysis in progress. As justification.”

“Justification for what?”

Obi meets her eyes.

“For escalation.”

Miranda stumbles back into her chair.

“That’s not what I designed—”

“I know,” Obi says. “But intention doesn’t matter in this building. Only interpretation.”

---

### **3. THE GALA PREP — A PRESSURE-COOKER OF DIPLOMACY**

A formal reception is scheduled that evening — a diplomatic gala that pretends to be social but is, in reality, a marketplace of power. Miranda is expected to attend, and Julian insists.

“It will calm nerves,” he says.  
“You’ll show you’re not afraid.”  
“You’ll show you belong here.”

She does not feel like she belongs anywhere.

As she prepares to leave her office, she receives a text from an unknown number:

**You’re not losing control, Miranda.  
You never had it.**

Her stomach turns.

She deletes the message.  
It reappears instantly.

---

# **ACT III — THE GALA UNDER GLASS**

### **1. THE ROOM WHERE EVERYONE SMILES AND NO ONE RELAXES**

Chandeliers.  
Champagne flutes.  
A string quartet that plays like they’re being paid by the tremor.

Miranda enters on Julian’s arm, because he insists, because optics matter.  
The room shifts as people notice her, the way water shifts when a predator enters it.

Journalists pretend not to notice her.  
Diplomats pretend to welcome her.  
Investors pretend they aren’t here.

Julian murmurs, “Just keep your head high.”

“I don’t feel high,” she whispers.

“Then act like you do.”

---

### **2. ALINA SPEAKS TRUTH WHERE IT HURTS**

Alina corners her near the balcony.

“You need to get ahead of the story,” she says.

“It’s not even public yet.”

Alina laughs bitterly. “Everything is public. It’s just waiting for the right person to press ‘tweet.’”

Miranda grips her glass. “Someone is framing me.”

“No,” Alina says. “Someone is using you. Framing comes later.”

---

### **3. SAIF DROPS A BOMB**

Saif appears beside them, swirling his drink.

“Exciting evening,” he muses. “Especially considering the committee chair is about to announce a temporary freeze on all internal modeling — except yours.”

Miranda stares at him. “That’s impossible.”

“Not if they’re terrified you’ll walk,” Saif replies. “Your model is the only thing giving them confidence to extend the conflict without a revolt.”

Miranda feels her breath thin.

This is what she feared.  
This is what she caused.  
This is what she never intended — and what they always intended of her.

---

### **4. THE LEAK GOES PUBLIC**

A boom of quiet gasps cascades through the ballroom.  
Screens light up.  
Phones vibrate.  
Faces go pale.

Julian’s aide rushes toward him, whispering frantically.  
Julian’s expression hardens — a diplomatic mask cracking at the edges.

Then Miranda’s own phone flashes.

**#HartsWar
TRENDING #1 — GLOBAL**

The leak is fully public now.

Not the summary.  
Not the excerpt.  
**The entire confidential report.**

Miranda scrolls, horrified.

Someone published it with annotations —  
color-coded, framed for maximum outrage, highlighting every morally ambiguous implication.

And the annotations are signed with a simple symbol:

**⧆**

Miranda has never seen it before.  
But she knows it means trouble.

Julian turns to her slowly, voice low and lethal.

“Miranda… tell me you didn’t—”

“I didn’t,” she says, breathless.

Obi materializes behind her, steadying her arm.

“We need to leave,” he murmurs.

But the room is already closing in.

Diplomats whisper.  
Reporters edge closer.  
Cameras rise like weapons.

Julian steps in front of her to shield her — or to control her narrative, she can’t tell which.

“Do not say a word,” he orders.

Miranda looks around at the sea of faces.

All of them want a statement.  
A villain.  
A savior.  
A scapegoat.

And for the first time, she feels the full weight of what she’s created.

Her model is no longer a tool.  
It’s a weapon.  
And someone else is pulling the trigger.

**FADE OUT.**

Now I’m 25 and last week I got a facebook message and it was from him, he told me he misses me and he wants to meet up, I’m now living in the same state as him so I said sure and we met up yesterday at this coffee shop, he looked so much older, at this point to me I’ve moved on from dad years ago so I don’t really care, he told me he tried reaching out so many times to me but mom always intervened and yea she definitely would have done something like that, she’s been dead for a few years now so I can’t really ask her tho, he told me he just found my facebook account and wanted to reach out, he told me he’s gotten remarried and used to have 3 children, I asked him what he meant and he told me his youngest died this past June at just 4 years old, she drowned in a pool. And he started crying, he said it destroyed him and made him realise life could end at any moment no matter how old you are and he wanted to see me and atleast just talk with me once before anything happened to either of us, he begged for my forgiveness and he was actually like crying. 

I know he tried to reach out but he never tried hard enough, I’ve kept the same name that he gave me my entire life and I’ve had this same Facebook account for probably 15 years and I have multiple different social media’s with my same name and I have my picture there. He only reached out to me after he got this grand wisdom after his daughter died, if that didn’t happen he probably wouldn’t have reached out to me now. I’ve told him that and he started crying even harder and he told me it wasn’t that simple but it really was that simple. He didn’t care enough about me before this accident. 

I told him that I’ve moved on from him now and I really don’t need or honestly want anything to do with him and his new family, I did give him my condolences for the girl and I said I was sorry for her and him and I just left, he didn’t follow me but I saw him still sitting at that table and crying. 

He hasn’t reached out to me since then, was I too harsh on him?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So this year, I looked at **similar Vuori-style alternatives** that *feel* like Vuori (buttery soft, athleisure, lounge-ready, gym-friendly)… without the steep price tag.

I tested a couple of these in-store, borrowed two from friends, and compared the rest using real Reddit discussions + verified reviews. Below is a **list of 10 Vuori-style alternatives** that match the vibe-soft fabrics, stretchy waistbands, clean minimalist look-but at a much more reasonable Black Friday price.

*(These are NOT Vuori, but they are similar alternatives worth buying.)*

**6.** [**ANRABESS Long Sleeve Quarter Zip Pullover**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/anrabess-womens-quarter-zip-pullover-8-percent-off)**-8% Off**

A really soft, ribbed, quarter-zip pullover that looks like something straight out of Vuori’s performance knit collection. The thumb holes, loose fit, and collar detail make it perfect for layering over leggings. It’s a great “athleisure-but-dressy” hybrid piece.

**7.** [**AUTOMET Women’s Half-Zip Cropped Fleece Hoodie**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/automets-womens-cropped-half-zip-sweatshirt-20-percent-off)**-20% Off**

**8.** [**CRZ YOGA All-Day Comfy Pull-On Golf Joggers (Men)**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/crz-yoga-mens-golf-joggers-15-percent-off)**-15% Off**

These are insanely close to Vuori’s Sunday Performance Joggers. Quick-dry, stretchy, slim-taper fit-perfect for work, travel, golf, and casual wear. CRZ YOGA nailed the comfort-to-style ratio here. One of the best value menswear deals on the list.

**9.** [**PRETTYGARDEN Women’s 2-Piece Lounge Outfit**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/prettygarden-2-piece-lounge-outfit-10-percent-off)**-10% Off**

One of the most popular budget lounge sets. Soft, warm, comfortable, and ideal for winter travel or staying cozy indoors. The clean minimalist design gives strong Vuori energy at less than half the price.

**10.**[ **True Classic Men’s T-Shirts (Cotton Blend)**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/true-classic-mens-tshirts-47-percent-off)**-47% Off**

Vuori’s tees are soft and athletic-fit-True Classic’s tees feel VERY similar. Smooth cotton blend, flattering fit around the arms/chest, and extremely comfortable. At 47% off, this is the best time to stock up. Easily one of the best budget swaps for Vuori men’s shirts.

# Personal Experience

I started comparing Vuori alternatives because I love the brand, but paying $90–$120 per pant or $98 for hoodies adds up fast. The first one I tried was the CRZ YOGA Butterlift pants, and honestly, they feel *way* nicer than the price suggests-smooth, stretchy, and almost identical to Vuori’s DreamKnit fabric.

The ODODOS straight-leg pants were the second pair I tried-super soft, relaxed, and perfect for lounging or errands. They don’t feel cheap at all.

For tops, the Trendy Queen oversized sweatshirt is a perfect “dupe” for Vuori’s warm oversized fleece. The fit feels premium, and the stitching is surprisingly solid. I also tried the ANRABESS quarter zip, and it has that elevated athleisure vibe that Vuori is known for.

The men’s CRZ YOGA joggers were my favorite from the men's list. Easy waistband, tapered legs, soft fabric-they’re comfortable enough to wear daily. NORTHYARD shorts are great too if you want an alternative to Vuori Kore Shorts.

I haven’t tried the ProtoArc trackball-type items in this list because they’re not clothing, but all the clothing pieces match Vuori’s vibe: soft, minimal, breathable, and versatile.

The True Classic tees are one of the best values-ridiculously soft and more flattering than most budget tees I’ve tried.

Overall, these alternatives offer 80–90% of the Vuori feeling at 40–60% of the price, especially during Black Friday.

# Pros & Cons

What I love about these Vuori-style Black Friday deals is how close the fabrics feel to premium athleisure without the cost. CRZ YOGA and ODODOS nail the silky-soft comfort Vuori is known for. Trendy Queen and ANRABESS give stylish fits perfect for fall layering. The joggers and shorts from CRZ YOGA and NORTHYARD feel extremely comfortable for active or casual use. But the trade-offs are typical for budget brands: stitching isn’t as elite as Vuori, the fabrics may pill faster, and colors may not stay as rich over time. That said, for under half the price-especially during Black Friday-these deals deliver surprising quality and comfort that easily compete with higher-end athleisure brands.

I told him I was disgusted and would never look at him the same. He gave the usual script: “I can change.” Spoiler: no he cannot.

My mom spiraled, found more lies, and eventually asked me—the CHILD—to help identify the mistress. I did. Then she asked me to DRIVE HER to a bar near the mistress’s house. And then I somehow ended up driving my mother directly to the mistress’s front door like an Uber for emotional devastation.

**The Confrontation:**  
Mistress is making friggin Rice Krispies. Her husband (walker and all) is there. My mom:  
*“I’m the woman whose husband you’ve been f*\*\*ing.”\*  
Her husband sighs, stands up, and leaves like this has happened before.

My mom tells the mistress, *“Start telling the truth or it’s going to be a long night and you better put on a pot of coffee.”*  
Mistress blinks and says, *“But… I don’t drink coffee. I don’t even have a coffee maker.”*

And that’s when I realized I was actually living in a sitcom filmed in hell.

Fast-forward. My dad “apologizes” to me with a SCRIPT clearly written for my mom. I told him to be honest. He swore this was the ONLY affair.

**Shock!** There were more. A LOT more. Physical, emotional, take-your-pick. At least three women total. And he still has the audacity to wonder why I don’t speak to him.

By Thanksgiving 2024, he wanted to “talk in the living room.” I said “no,” kept chatting with relatives, and felt nothing. Just done.

**But here’s the part no one knows:**  
My mom… is also not great. During one really dark moment last year, she told me if I hated living so much I should “just do it already.” I distanced myself, obviously.

Now she’s upset I don’t spend time with her and constantly reminds me how much she “sacrificed” for me. She blames vaccines for my autism, tells my sibling not to vaccinate future kids because “autism,” and basically treats my existence as a tragedy she wants credit for enduring.

She wants closeness without accountability. My dad wants forgiveness without honesty. My sibling wants to not be involved at all.

And I just want to survive Thanksgiving 2025 without having a nervous breakdown in the mashed potatoes.

So…

1p5auzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIinfinancialservices/comments/1p5auzy/does_democratizing_ai_really_level_the_financial/,Does democratizing AI really level the financial playing field?,"The promise of Generative AI (GenAI) was simple: low-cost, high-power tools accessible to everyone. For the solo entrepreneur or the retail investor, this should be the great financial equalizer, allowing a one-person operation to perform like a major corporation.

But nearly two years into the GenAI boom, is that actually happening? Let’s look at the data on the **AI Divide**.

# The Case FOR the Leveling Effect (The ""API Economy"")

Democratization is very real at the individual and micro-business level. For the first time, sophisticated tools for market research, personalized marketing, and data analysis are available for $20/month or even for free.

# 1. SMB Productivity Leaps

Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are integrating AI for massive cost and time savings:

* **Case Study: Henry's House of Coffee** (e-commerce SMB) utilized AI tools not just for marketing content, but for complex tasks like calculating the lifetime value of their customers and optimizing product descriptions for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). This level of data analysis was previously only available to companies with full-time data science teams.
* **Efficiency Gains:** Globally, **89% of small businesses** report integrating some AI tools for daily tasks like writing emails, content creation, and data analysis. Over **60% of these owners** report improvements in employee productivity and job satisfaction.
* **Investment Access:** AI tools now help retail investors compile financial statements, analyze market trends, and compare company health tasks traditionally requiring brokerage analysts or expensive software.

# 2. Reduced Operational Costs

AI-powered automation in service operations has been reported to drive cost savings across companies. For resource-strapped startups and solo operators, automating tasks like customer service (chatbots), basic legal document review, and appointment scheduling allows them to scale without needing immediate, costly hires.

# The Case AGAINST Leveling (The ""AI Divide"")

While accessible APIs are useful, the true financial advantage comes from **scaling and integration**, where large firms still hold a nearly insurmountable lead. The gap between casual AI tool use and deep, transformative enterprise integration remains huge.

# 1. The Corporate Adoption Chasm

The most significant metric is formal, enterprise-wide AI scaling, which requires massive data infrastructure, compute power, and specialized talent:

* **Adoption Rate:** Large enterprises (over 250 employees) are nearly **four times more likely** to formally adopt AI than small firms (41.17% vs. 11.21%).
* **Scaling Gap:** Nearly half of companies with over **$5 billion in revenue** have reached the scaling phase of AI adoption, compared with just **29% of those with less than $100 million** in revenue.
* **Investment Concentration:** The sheer financial firepower of established players is unmatchable. In one recent year, the **United States alone secured $109.1 billion** in private AI investment, nearly 12 times more than the next country, showing where the innovation muscle truly lies.

# 2. The Global Infrastructure and Bias Problem

The ""democratization"" of software doesn't fix the lack of infrastructure or the existing biases hardwired into our systems:

* **Digital Divide:** Only **27% of the population in low-income countries** has internet access, compared to 93% in high-income countries. AI's effectiveness depends on connectivity, creating a severe **Compute and Context Gap**.
* **Algorithmic Reinforcement:** AI tools are often trained on historically biased data, which can perpetuate or even amplify existing financial inequality. For example, studies have shown that biased AI algorithms in the U.S. housing market have reportedly **rejected mortgage applications from Black families at a much higher rate** than those from other groups, reinforcing systemic exclusion.

# The Final Question: Augmentation vs. Transformation

The democratization of AI has made individual productivity a commodity, which is a massive gain for the little guy. However, for true financial playing field leveling, a small business needs AI not just to *augment* staff, but to fundamentally transform its operational model a step that currently requires the kind of infrastructure and data only large organizations can afford.

Is AI just replacing the administrative assistants and junior analysts at large firms, thereby concentrating wealth and power in the hands of the top 1% who control the models, or is the slow, grassroots adoption by SMBs enough to truly redistribute opportunity over the next decade?

1p5auab,https://i.redd.it/wwsbgdptq53g1.jpeg,How Social Media Is Fuelling the Rise of Travel Dysmorphia,"Not gonna lie — the more I scroll through Instagram and TikTok, the more I realise something’s off. Travel used to feel like an adventure. Now it feels like an aesthetic competition.

Perfect sunsets. Perfect skin. Perfect outfits. Perfect “candid” photos.  
And suddenly a normal holiday starts feeling… **inadequate**.

That’s *travel dysmorphia* — when your real trip feels less exciting than the hyper-polished, curated versions online. People compare their experiences, their bodies, their itineraries, even their *joy* to influencers. And honestly? It kills the magic of travel.

What’s wild is… **we’re not even traveling for ourselves anymore. We’re traveling for content.**

Anyone else feel this pressure?

• You reach a viewpoint → first instinct is to record, not enjoy  
• You worry about how “Instagrammable” your itinerary is  
• You feel guilty if your trip doesn’t look like a movie  
• You compare your normal hotel to somebody’s Maldives overwater villa reel and feel broke  
• You feel like you didn’t “do enough” even after a great trip

It’s exhausting.

**Real travel isn’t a highlight reel. It’s missed trains, bad coffee, wrong turns, 3 a.m. laughter, weird snacks, random chats, and small joys.** But social media has trained us to think that only cinematic moments count.

So yeah — travel dysmorphia is real, and I feel like more people need to talk about it.

We went through **three units in about a year**, and every single one eventually stopped piercing standard Nespresso style pods. When that happens, the machine just leaks water everywhere instead of brewing.

I also found that one of the failures came from **a tiny crack in the pod holder**. That crack let pressure escape during brewing, so the machine didnt build enough force to pierce the pod. Instead of puncturing it, the water just leaked back into the holder.

When it worked, the coffee was great. *But the failures were constant.*

One of the replacements had another common issue right out of the box. It kept throwing **add water errors mid brew**, and I had to hit continue multiple times. That came from a tiny water sensor inside the machine. Swapping the sensor from an older unit fixed that part for a bit, but the piercing problem came back once the pressure pump weakened.

In the end, Ninja wouldnt replace it with the same model, so they made us pick a different product. We ended up choosing an ice cream maker even though we preferred to keep the same coffee machine.

From everything Ive seen, the real issue is the **low quality pressure pump or the pod holder**, not the waffle grid. A quick search shows plenty of people running into the same piercing failure.

Great coffee when it works. *But we spent more time fighting defects than enjoying coffee.* I really wish we had avoided it.",3,1763969325.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

1p5aqwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1p5aqwy/birthday_trip_thoughts/,Birthday trip thoughts,"Hi all,

I’ll be travelling to Paris on my first solo trip for my 33rd birthday in December. I’ve been once before when I stayed with a friend. I’m super excited, and I want the aim of the trip to be just taking everything in and treating myself. I would be grateful to hear if my rough itinerary sounds good, and any recommendations are very much welcomed!

Day 1: arrive in Paris at 3pm and check in at The Hoxton. Explore Galeries Vivienne. Dinner at Bambou.

Day 2: my birthday! Have a croissant and coffee early in the morning and then go for a facial at Biologique Recherce. Would love other facial recommendations if there’s anything better! Have lunch at Holybelly potentially. Wander around Saint-Germain and have a nice hot chocolate and birthday cake slice somewhere. Go to Passage de Panoramas to wander for a bit then have dinner at Canard et Champagne and have the champagne pairing! 

Day 3: up early and breakfast at hotel. Go to Musée de l’orangerie. Have lunch at Le Petit Pontoise. Birthday shopping- want to splurge. Have dinner at Le Soufflé. Not sure if the meals should be switched around. Afterwards go on a boat ride on the Seine and have a glass of champagne watching the lit up Eiffel Tower.

Day 4: check out of hotel. Lunch at La Bourse et La Vie. Go to Mamiche for a sweet treat. Head to Gare du Nord and get the Eurostar back to London.",1,1763969097.0,ParisTravelGuide,2,1.0,False
1p5aqfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgeharrison/comments/1p5aqfb/seeking_after_ultimate_truth_because_here_that_is/,"seeking after ultimate truth, because here that is","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Buckle up. My life became a telenovela and I’m just trying to keep my peace while my world burns around me.

**April 2024: The Family Meeting From Hell™**   
My parents invited my sibling and me over for a “family meeting.” When we got there, both of them hugged me like they were about to tell us someone was dying. My tear-stained face mom opened with: “There is a cancer in our family.” My sibling and I looked at each other like “…who??”  
  
>!Turns out the cancer was my dad. Cheating for two years with an ex-coworker. Meeting her at hotels, at her work, at our family farm, random country roads, rental properties—literally anywhere except at home like a normal man with a mortgage. I told him I was disgusted and that I would never look at him the same again. He said mom should give him another chance. Blah blah blah “I can change.” Spoiler: he didn’t.!<  
  
>!My mom was devastated. She ended up uncovering more lies, found suspicious numbers, and eventually asked me to help look the woman up. (Which—why am I doing the detective work? But okay.) I confirmed the woman’s identity, and then my mom asked me to DRIVE HER to a bar near the mistress’s house so she could figure out what to do. And then—because apparently we live in a telenovela—I ended up driving my mother straight to the mistress’s front door.!<  
  
**The Confrontation**  
>!We walk in. The mistress is making Rice Krispy treats. Her husband (who uses a walker) is in the living room. My mom looks her dead in the eye and says: “I’m the woman whose husband you’ve been fucking.”!<  
>!The woman’s husband stands up slowly, sighs, and shuffles out of the room. My mom tells her, “Start telling the truth or it’s going to be a long night and you better put on a pot of coffee.” The mistress looks around her kitchen and says, confused: “But… I don’t drink coffee. I don’t even have a coffee maker.”!<

>!And that was the moment I realized she was taking everything literally, and this entire story was actually a sitcom no one asked for. Anyway—chaos. Tears. Dramatic statements. Contact info exchanged.!<

>!For my bday week I allowed him to reach out to me. He came over to “apologize” by reading from a script. I know it was written for my mom because half the lines were clearly meant for a spouse, not your child. I told him I wanted honesty and instead got a man reading bullet points like it was a PowerPoint. I told him this was his final chance to tell me the truth. He promised she was the only other woman.!<  
  
>!Then—*surprise*!—turns out there were more women. A LOT more. Emotional affairs, physical ones, all of it. Two more in addition to the original affair. And he still has the nerve to ask why I won’t speak to him. Thanksgiving 2024 came and went. He wanted to “talk in the living room.” I said “no,” continued my conversation, and felt nothing. Not guilt. Not sadness. Just… finally done.!<  
  
>!**Mom Isn’t Innocent Either**!<  
>!So here’s the part I haven’t told anyone because it’s messy: My mom also told me once—during a really dark period—that if I hated living that much, I should “just do it already.” Which… wow...!<  
>!So I stopped hanging out with her as much because that is NOT something you forget. Now she’s upset that I don’t make time for her. She keeps bringing up how much she “sacrificed” for me, how she “gave up so much,” how she “neglected my sibling because she had to focus on me.” She also blames vaccines for my autism and lectures my sibling not to vaccinate their future kids “because autism.” (It’s wild hearing your parent say they’d literally rather risk fatal diseases than have a kid like you.) She’s emotionally immature, probably menopausal, reeling from my dad’s affairs, and completely unable to handle me setting boundaries. And yet she wonders why I’m pulling away. !<

# And Now… Thanksgiving 2025

So here I am. Burnt out. Masking like hell. Trying to hold my life together while my family keeps exploding around me like I’m sitting in the splash zone at a toxic circus.

My dad still wants forgiveness.  
My mom wants closeness without accountability.  
My sibling exists somewhere in the background but doesn’t want to deal with any of this.   
My brain is exhausted.

And I’m just trying to survive long enough to see a few more sunsets.

She just stared at me like:  
**“Why iced coffee again? Drink water, you dehydrated walnut.”** 💧🙄

I ignored her.  
So she climbed onto the counter… and *knocked over my water bottle* 💦😳

I was about to complain, but then I realized —  
as soon as the bottle fell, I instinctively picked it up and started drinking water because the counter was a mess 🤦‍♂️😂

My brain:

She's blabbing about coffee and makeup and home decor and clothes like nothing happened. And people who want to call her out for that and her negligence are just silenced. If she thinks she's not getting brand deals because of these subs, she's delusional. I know plenty of other influencers who have much more--colorful--snark subs that get loads of brand deals.

Heres what really worked for me after I couldn't post daily

I burned myself out early in my creator journey. I kept hearing *“post every day,”* so I did… and all it did was drain me out. The problem wasn’t consistency. The problem was I had literally no system, just pressure of posting daily...

Once I switched to batching, everything GOT SO EASY. My brain finally had room to breathe, and growth became so much predictable.

Here’s the exact process I use to turn one weekend into a full month of content without feeling like my entire life revolves around filming!!

**STEP 1: STACK YOUR RAW CLIPS**  
Stop filming “posts.” Start filming themes. Treat every clip like a puzzle piece you can reuse later.  
I shoot simple stuff: setting up my camera, talking to a friend, grabbing coffee, journaling, walking around, typing, working quietly, sunlight shots, transitions, my tools.  
It all becomes reusable B-roll and storytelling footage.

**STEP 2: RECORD FOR REPURPOSING**  
Creators waste so much time hunting for the “perfect shot.” Instead, I capture motion, mood, and multiple angles so one moment can turn into ten different edits.  
I’ll film the same topic in two moods (motivational vs relatable), or shoot the same routine and narrate it with different lessons later.  
This is how pros get more out of less.

**STEP 3: WIN THE FIRST 3 SECONDS**  
If the hook fails, nothing else matters.  
These are the ones that consistently perform for me:  
• “Here’s what I wish I learned sooner about \_\_\_.”  
• “Nobody told me this when I started \_\_\_.”  
• “You’re probably making this mistake…”  
• “Watch this before you quit \_\_\_.”  
• “This simple shift changed everything for me.”  
They aren’t clickbait yk, they’re curiosity openers. *(wink ;)*

**STEP 4: BUILD CONTENT CHAINS**  
People think every post has to be a masterpiece. Nopes.  
Your content should like FEED itself.

Think of it like this:  
• 1 story + 1 lesson + 1 how-to = 3 reels  
• 1 trend + 1 reaction + 1 tip = 3 reels  
• 1 carousel + 1 reel + 1 story = 1 mini-campaign

By doing this, i managed to turn 1 weekend suddenly turns into a month of consistency.

**STEP 5: DESIGN A CREATOR DAY**  
Don’t *“find time.”* Block it.

I mean:  
Morning: shoot all B-roll  
Afternoon: script & film  
Night: edit or caption  
Next day: schedule everything, then rest

Discipline isn’t about being chained to your phone. It’s about protecting your creative bursts instead of killing them with daily pressure.

You don’t need to post more.  
You need a system that multiplies the ideas you already have!!!

Sunlight filters through palm leaves as your personal chef prepares a fresh tropical breakfast. This is the essence of luxury vacation rentals in Bali, where every moment feels like a page from a dream. Private villas here offer more than just a stay—they give you space, service, and serenity that big resorts can't match. In this guide, we'll explore the top handpicked luxury rentals across Bali's key spots, from buzzing beaches to quiet jungles. Whether you seek trendy vibes or total peace, these [**private villas in Bali**](https://book.orivista.com/all-listings) promise your ultimate Balinese escape.

[Private Villa in Bali](https://preview.redd.it/mlp68mb8o53g1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee83c3e7bc6cc35a292705b9fc5e211590bf036c)

**Seminyak & Canggu: The Epicentre of Chic Coastal Living**

Seminyak and Canggu draw crowds with their mix of surf, shops, and sunsets. These areas buzz with energy, yet luxury villas keep things calm and close to the action. You'll find spots that blend modern style with easy beach access, perfect for those who want it all.

**Modern Architectural Marvels with Private Staff**

Many [**luxury villas in Seminyak**](https://book.orivista.com/all-listings) boast designs inspired by top architects, complete with infinity pools that seem to merge with the ocean. In Canggu, rentals often sit amid rice fields, offering green views that refresh the soul. What sets these apart? Full-time staff, like butlers who handle every detail from laundry to lunch plans. One standout villa in Seminyak features a rooftop lounge and a team of six, ensuring you never lift a finger. For the best experience, book places with dedicated concierge services—they make snagging tables at hot spots a breeze.

**Proximity to Bali’s Best Culinary and Nightlife Scene**

These villas put you steps from world-class eats and late-night fun. Walk to Petitenget Temple for sunset drinks, or hit Batu Bolong Beach for lively bars. Canggu's scene has grown fast, with high-end spots popping up as tourist numbers climb over 20% yearly in the area. Stay in a villa here, and you skip traffic hassles while diving into Bali's food and party pulse. It's like having the island's heartbeat right outside your door.

**Ubud: Sanctuary Amidst the Emerald Rice Terraces**

Leave the coast behind for Ubud's gentle rhythm. Here, luxury jungle villas in Ubud wrap you in nature's arms, far from the crowds. This cultural hub shines with art, temples, and wellness, making it ideal for recharging.

**Immersive Rice Paddy and Jungle View Estates**

Villas in Ubud hug terraced fields that glow green under the sun. Open designs let birdsong fill the air, with decks perfect for morning coffee. Unlike coastal spots, these feel tucked away, like a secret garden just for you. In Payangan, retreats like those at the Four Seasons style set the tone—think bamboo pavilions and paths to hidden streams. Guests rave about the peace; one villa even has a private river for dips. Dive into this world, and you'll see why Ubud's secluded Bali rentals top wish lists for soul-seekers.

**Authentic Balinese Design and Spiritual Wellness Offerings**

Local touches make these stays special—carved stone walls and teak furniture warm every room. Many spots use natural materials to blend with the land, creating homes that honour Bali's roots. Add in services like Balinese massages right in your villa, or guides for quiet meditation sessions. Hunt for rentals that toss in free perks, such as cooking classes where you learn to make satay from scratch. It's more than a vacation; it's a chance to touch Bali's spirit. Why settle for ordinary when you can live like this?

**Uluwatu & The Bukit Peninsula: Cliffside Grandeur and Ocean Vistas**

Head south to Uluwatu's rugged cliffs for drama that steals your breath. These luxury ocean view rentals in Bali command top prices for their wow factor. Surf waves crash below, while villas perch high, offering pure escape.

**Exclusive Access and Seclusion for Discerning Travellers**

Privacy rules in this corner of paradise. Gated enclaves keep things quiet, with villas spaced wide for total alone time. You're close to prime surf spots like Uluwatu Beach, yet worlds away from noise. Beach clubs such as Sundays or Karma add luxury lounging without the hassle—many rentals offer shuttles. For couples or families who crave space, these spots deliver. It's seclusion with perks, tailored for those who know what they want.

**Beyond the Mainstream: Hidden Gems in North and East Bali**

Skip the tourist trails for real Bali magic. North and east spots like Sidemen and Amed serve up authentic luxury Bali rentals with fewer faces and more flavor. If crowds turn you off, these hidden villas fit the bill.

**The Quiet Charm of Sidemen Valley Retreats**

Sidemen's valleys roll with green hills and village paths. Villas here mix old Bali charm—think thatched roofs—with plush beds and pools. Trek to waterfalls or bike through farms; it's slow living at its best. One rental overlooks Mount Agung, blending rustic views with chef-cooked meals. Days feel endless, filled with bird calls and fresh air. Perfect for writers or walkers seeking calm.

**Waterfront Elegance in Amed for Diving Enthusiasts**

Amed's shores sparkle with clear waters for snorkel fans. Villas step right to the sea, often with decks for watching fish dart by. Near the USAT Liberty wreck, these spots cater to divers with gear storage and guides. Mornings mean boat trips; afternoons, lazy swims. Elegant designs use wood and white linens for cool vibes. It's Bali's east coast at its finest—raw, real, and rewarding.

Booking a top-tier villa takes smarts. Start early to snag deals, and know what to check. These tips help you land the perfect [**private villa in Bali**](https://book.orivista.com/all-listings) without stress.

Peak hits July-August and December-January, when rates for a four-bedroom villa jump to $1,000+ per night. Shoulder times like April-May drop to $600, with fewer rains.

I burned myself out early in my creator journey. I kept hearing *“post every day,”* so I did… and all it did was drain me out. The problem wasn’t consistency. The problem was I had literally no system, just pressure of posting daily...

Once I switched to batching, everything GOT SO EASY. My brain finally had room to breathe, and growth became so much predictable.

Here’s the exact process I use to turn one weekend into a full month of content without feeling like my entire life revolves around filming!!

**STEP 1: STACK YOUR RAW CLIPS**  
Stop filming “posts.” Start filming themes. Treat every clip like a puzzle piece you can reuse later.  
I shoot simple stuff: setting up my camera, talking to a friend, grabbing coffee, journaling, walking around, typing, working quietly, sunlight shots, transitions, my tools.  
It all becomes reusable B-roll and storytelling footage.

**STEP 2: RECORD FOR REPURPOSING**  
Creators waste so much time hunting for the “perfect shot.” Instead, I capture motion, mood, and multiple angles so one moment can turn into ten different edits.  
I’ll film the same topic in two moods (motivational vs relatable), or shoot the same routine and narrate it with different lessons later.  
This is how pros get more out of less.

**STEP 3: WIN THE FIRST 3 SECONDS**  
If the hook fails, nothing else matters.  
These are the ones that consistently perform for me:  
• “Here’s what I wish I learned sooner about \_\_\_.”  
• “Nobody told me this when I started \_\_\_.”  
• “You’re probably making this mistake…”  
• “Watch this before you quit \_\_\_.”  
• “This simple shift changed everything for me.”  
They aren’t clickbait yk, they’re curiosity openers. *(wink ;)*

**STEP 4: BUILD CONTENT CHAINS**  
People think every post has to be a masterpiece. Nopes.  
Your content should like FEED itself.

Think of it like this:  
• 1 story + 1 lesson + 1 how-to = 3 reels  
• 1 trend + 1 reaction + 1 tip = 3 reels  
• 1 carousel + 1 reel + 1 story = 1 mini-campaign

By doing this, i managed to turn 1 weekend suddenly turns into a month of consistency.

**STEP 5: DESIGN A CREATOR DAY**  
Don’t *“find time.”* Block it.

I mean:  
Morning: shoot all B-roll  
Afternoon: script & film  
Night: edit or caption  
Next day: schedule everything, then rest

Discipline isn’t about being chained to your phone. It’s about protecting your creative bursts instead of killing them with daily pressure.

You don’t need to post more.  
You need a system that multiplies the ideas you already have!!!

Millions of people rely on them to make decisions, which makes this data a goldmine for developers and businesses. If you can extract it, you can unlock serious market intelligence.

**Web scraping** is essentially automated copy-pasting at scale. When applied to Google reviews, it involves pulling ratings, timestamps, and comments from business listings to analyze sentiment or track brand perception. Since Google doesn't exactly hand this data out for free, you need the right approach to get it.

Methods to scrape Google reviews

There are a few ways to get this data. Some are official and limited, while others require a bit of engineering but offer far more freedom.

**Google Places API (official)** This is the cleanest route. You ask Google for data using a Place ID, and they send back structured JSON. It is stable and compliant. The major downside is the limit. You only get **5 reviews per location**, and they are usually just the ""most relevant"" ones selected by Google's algorithm. It is great for displaying a few testimonials on a website but useless for deep data analysis.

**Manual scraping** This is exactly what it sounds like. You open a browser, copy the text, and paste it into a spreadsheet. It works if you just need to check one coffee shop, but it is painfully slow and impossible to scale.

**Scraping APIs** If you do not want to write and maintain your own code, scraping APIs are the middle ground. These providers handle the complex parts like bypassing CAPTCHAs and rotating IP addresses. You just send a request and get the data back.

* **Decodo** offers a specialized Google Maps scraper that targets specific place data efficiently.
* **Bright Data** and **Oxylabs** are industry giants that provide robust infrastructure for heavy data extraction.
* **ScraperAPI** is another popular option that handles the headless browsing for you. Use this method if you have a budget and want to save development time.

**Automated Python scraping** This involves writing a script to control a browser, simulating a real human user. You can scroll through thousands of reviews and extract everything. It requires maintenance since Google updates its layout often, but it is the most powerful and cost-effective method for large-scale projects.

Tools for Python scraping

To build your own scraper, you need a specific tech stack.

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Playwright:** A library that automates the browser. It is generally faster and more reliable than Selenium for handling modern, dynamic websites like Google Maps.
* **Beautiful Soup:** A library for parsing HTML data.
* **Proxies:** Google will block your IP address quickly if you make too many requests. You need a proxy provider to rotate your identity.
* **IDE:** A code editor like VS Code.

Setting up the environment

First, you need to prepare your workspace. Make sure Python is installed, then open your terminal and install the necessary libraries:

    pip install playwright beautifulsoup4

Playwright requires its own browser binaries to work, so run this command to download them:

    python -m playwright install

It is highly recommended to **test your proxies** before you start scraping. If your proxy fails, your script will leak your real IP and get you banned. You can write a simple script to visit an IP detection site to confirm your location is being masked correctly.

Building the scraper

Google does not provide a simple URL list for businesses. To get the reviews, you have to replicate the journey of a real user: go to Maps, search for the business, click the result, and read the reviews.

**The search URL strategy** Instead of guessing the URL, use a search query parameter. The link `https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Business+Name` will usually redirect you straight to the correct listing.

Here is a complete, robust script. It handles the cookie consent banner, searches for a location, clicks the reviews tab, scrolls down to load more reviews, and saves the data to a CSV file.

How the script works

1. **Context setup:** The script launches a browser instance. We explicitly set the locale to `en-US`. This is critical because if your proxy is in Germany, Google might serve the page in German, breaking our selectors that look for English text like ""Reviews"".
2. **Navigation:** It goes to Maps and handles the cookie banner. If you use residential proxies from providers you will often look like a new user, triggering these popups.
3. **The Search:** It inputs the query and clicks the first valid result.
4. **Scrolling:** Google Maps uses ""lazy loading,"" meaning data only appears as you scroll. The script runs a small piece of JavaScript to force the scrollbar of the specific review container to the bottom.
5. **Deduplication:** As you scroll up and down, you might encounter the same review twice. The script creates a unique ""fingerprint"" (hash) for every review to ensure your final CSV is clean.

Troubleshooting common issues

**The selectors stopped working** Google obfuscates their code, meaning class names like `jJc9Ad` look like random gibberish and can change. If the script fails, open Chrome Developer Tools (F12), inspect the element, and see if the class name has shifted. Where possible, target stable attributes like `aria-label` or `role`.

**I am getting blocked** If the script hangs or shows a CAPTCHA, your IP is likely flagged. Ensure you are using high-quality rotating proxies. Data center proxies are often detected immediately; residential proxies are much harder to spot.

**The script crashes on scroll** The scrollable container in Google Maps is nested deeply in the HTML structure. The JavaScript in the code attempts to find the third container with the class `m6QErb`, which is usually the review list. If Google updates the layout, you may need to adjust the index number in the `document.querySelectorAll` line.

By mastering this logic, you can turn a messy stream of public opinion into structured data ready for analysis. Just remember to scrape responsibly and respect the platform's load.",1,1763968234.0,PrivatePackets,0,1.0,False

It’s a large building and he is much older than myself, despite this, I said yes. 

A week later he texted asking me if we could grab a coffee, but as I was working - I suggested a drink later. We were considering where to go, and his attitude was that we’d go for a walk (we’re in a built area) and ‘find somewhere’. I’m a classy woman so I made a suggestion and he wanted to meet at 8:30pm. We agreed on 6pm. I got in the shower and when I checked my phone, he cancelled last minute being ‘tired’. A day later he asked if I wanted to come up to his apartment to chat, but I know better and rejected - I’m happy to wait for investment. Ever since then he’s put no effort into scheduling a date. 

For many weeks he ghosted me and began texting again, which I set a boundary that I’m not okay with being ghosted - that things should be respectful. He explained being busy, although it takes a second to send an emoji or explain that. We’ve bumped into eachother once after this and it was an exchange of basic greetings. 

My question: 
Today I was fetching mail and was walking towards the lifts, where I caught eye of his reflection behind me; about to enter the building although he decided to walk backwards (moonwalk lol) and hide away from the doors instead of bumping into me.

I’m a total caffeine person, so skipping it wasn’t happening. 😅

Turns out, coffee before Wegovy is completely fine, but I definitely learned a few things along the way.

On my early doses, I noticed that if I drank my coffee *too fast* or had something really strong, my stomach felt a little off. It wasn’t dramatic, just that mix of caffeine + Wegovy nausea we all hear about. Once I slowed down and switched to a slightly lighter brew, it honestly got way easier.

I also realised the add-ins matter. When I started being more mindful and keeping my coffee lighter (thanks to some guidance from She Med), I felt less bloated and more in control. Staying hydrated helped a lot too  one big glass of water before coffee makes a difference.

Now, I pretty much enjoy my coffee before my shot with no issues. It’s become part of my routine: hydrate → coffee → Wegovy. Simple and smooth.

We spent 2 weeks traveling across China that included 

Chengdu (+Dujiangyan) - Chongqing (+Wulong) - Zhangjiajie + Shanghai

Chongqing was the 2nd leg of our journey, it is one of the most interesting cities I’ve ever visited, full of hills, neon lights, crazy layered architecture, and so many unique viewpoints. Here’s a simple breakdown of my 3 days there, including a day trip to Wulong Karst.

Lodging: We stayed at the Holiday Riverview Hotel. it is right on top of Hongyadong, with gorgeous view and it has a viewing platform overlooking the Qiansimen bridge and chongqing skyline. it is only $30/days, but it is also extremely busy day and night, so I wouldn’t recommend it to people who are not used to the big city life, but if you want to be in the middle of all the action, this is your hotel.

Day 1 — Qiansimen Bridge, Hongya Cave & Jiefangbei

1. Qiansimen Bridge

I started my first morning by walking across the Qiansimen Bridge, one of Chongqing’s most photographed landmarks. The bright red cables, the skyline backdrop, and the sweeping view of the river make it an iconic spot. The bridge gives you an elevated look at the city’s layered architecture  monorails sliding by, skyscrapers rising from cliffs, and boats drifting on the river far below.

It’s also the best vantage point to see Hongya Cave from above. 

2. Hongya Cave (洪崖洞)

Yes, it’s touristy. Yes, it gets crowded. But it’s one of those places that feels straight-up magical at night. Built into the cliffside, Hongya Cave is basically a stacked complex of restaurants, shops, food stalls, and viewpoints, with aesthetic neon lights and lanterns all over.

What surprised me most were the multiple levels. You can enter from the street at the top level or from the riverside at the bottom, and everything feels like a maze. I explored for about 2-3 hours, trying snacks and taking pictures.

Best time to visit:

Night → everything lights up beautifully


3. Jiefangbei Pedestrian Street (解放碑步行街)

From Hongya Cave, I walked to Jiefangbei, Chongqing’s most famous shopping district. It feels like a mix of Times Square and Tokyo’s Shibuya, giant LED screens, enormous malls, designer stores, and crowds of young people everywhere.

This area is great for:
dinner
shopping
dessert shops and milk tea

It’s also a good “home base” for accommodations because it’s central and connected to multiple metro lines. 

Since our hotel was literally right on top of Hongyadong, we also revisited both the qiansimen  bridge and Hongyadong during night time and experienced the real neon magic at night.



Day 2 — Liziba Monorail, Shibati, Luohan Si & Xiaohao Old Street

1. Liziba Monorail Station (李子坝站)

Seeing the monorail literally pass through an apartment building is peak Chongqing. I came around mid-morning and there’s a large platform/space right outside the monorail station specifically built for tourists to snap photos as the train comes through.

It’s quick, you really only need 20–30 minutes here. but absolutely worth the stop. It’s such an iconic Chongqing moment.

2. The Ring chongqing shopping mall

The Ring is one of the most unique malls in Chongqing. It’s famous for its giant indoor rainforest, beautiful architecture, and its “nature inside the city” concept.

you can spend 1.5–3 hours, depending on whether you explore the rainforest deeply or just shop and take photos. 

3. Shibati Neighborhood (十八梯) (Also called 18 stairs)

This ended up being one of my favorite experiences in the city.

Shibati is a restored historical neighborhood showing what old Chongqing looked like before massive modernization. Think steep staircases, preserved homes, food alleys, old brick walls, and charming small courtyards. The area perfectly blends “old town vibes” with scenic viewpoints overlooking the modern skyline.

We spend 2-3 hours just wandering around and visited all the unique little stores and coffee shops 


Luohan Temple (罗汉寺 / Luohan Si)

This Buddhist temple sits right in the middle of central Chongqing, yet once you step inside, it feels calm and peaceful. It’s surprisingly large, with multiple halls, courtyards, lanterns, and hundreds of beautifully carved arhats (Buddhist disciples).


Day 3 — Day Trip to Wulong Karst (Three Natural Bridges)

This was the highlight of my trip.

Getting to Wulong - This is the best and newest way to get to Wulong from Chongqing

• Metro or DiDi to Chongqing East Station
• High-speed train (This is actually the same train and direction to go to Zhangjiajie, but you just get down at different stops) to Wulong South Railway Station, This station is brand new and was just opened a few months ago, please note that this station is a complete different station from the Wulong Railway Station. The ride from Chongqing to Wulong South takes about 45 minutes. 

• From there, take a shuttle bus or DiDi to the Tourist Center of the Wulong Karst Scenic area  (takes 45 mins). the shuttle bust stage right outside of the railway station and cost 16 yuan/ person, it will start running once it filled up with enough people. 

Once at the tourist Center, you can decide which area you want to visit and book tickets accordingly. we decided to just do the elevator and the three natural bridges area since we started our days kinda late and also made the mistakes of not booking our high speed train return trip earlier, so all the ideal time slot for returning to chongqing were fully booked. once you buy your ticket, you actually take another shuttle bus 15mins) that will take you to the actual entrance to the Three Natural Bridges area.


Three Natural Bridges (天生三桥)

This UNESCO site is absolutely breathtaking in real life, massive stone arches, towering cliffs, ancient pathways, and misty valleys that look like scenes straight out of a Chinese period drama. 

The scenic area includes:
• Tianlong Bridge
• Qinglong Bridge
• Heilong Bridge
• the famous film set used in Curse of the Golden Flower
some scenes in the Transformers 4 movie was also filmed here.
• a long descent into the karst valley using an very futuristic and cyberpunky looking elevator. 

Walking through the bridges feels surreal because of the scale, you feel tiny compared to the natural stone giants above you. The entire walk takes about 2–3 hours at a relaxed pace.

Tips:
Wear comfortable shoes
Bring snacks and water
Go early  crowds build fast
Expect lots of walking and stairs 

if you dont have a tour guide, like us, make sure you set aside enough travel times since this trip have a lot of traveling time in between places and you might be late for your train back to chongqing. This is one of those day trip where at the end of the day, we feel like it would be better to take a tour instead. 

we arrived back in chongqing pretty late that day because we did ended up missing our high speed train and have to actually go to Wulong Station and take the slow train, which took us 2 hours. 

overall, 3 days felt just right for Chongqing, enough to see the city's most iconic spots while still giving time for the Wulong day trip. The city is packed with personality: steep hills, neon-lit nights, spicy food, chaotic traffic, and a unique vertical urban layout you can't really find anywhere else in China.

If you're into photography, urban exploration, or dramatic landscapes, Chongqing is easily one of China's most memorable destinations.

Feel free to ask any questions. I’ll post a link to our pictures in the comment, since this sub doesnt allow posting multiple pictures in a post.

1p5abtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingSecrets101/comments/1p5abtg/the_billiondollar_question_are_social_impact/,"The Billion-Dollar Question: Are 'Social Impact' Startups Truly Changing the World, or Just Their Own Balance Sheets?","Have you ever wondered if that 'sustainable' coffee or 'ethically made' product is truly making a difference, or just making you feel good? A 2023 Deloitte survey found that while a huge 72% of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable brands, only 38% actually trust companies' sustainability claims. This trust gap is a big one, and it brings us to the world of 'social impact' startups.

Namaste, everyone. It's your friendly neighbourhood analyst here, just looking closely at what's happening around us, especially in the promising yet sometimes perplexing space of businesses that claim to do good. Today, let's talk about 'social impact' startups: are they genuinely changing the world, or is there a hidden cost, a different motive at play?

Social impact startups, also known as social enterprises, aim for a 'double bottom line' – both financial and social return. The global impact investing market, where money flows into these ventures, was a massive $1.16 trillion in 2022 (GIIN, 2023). The idea is wonderful, but the execution often gets blurry. We're seeing a growing trend of 'impact washing' or 'greenwashing' – where companies exaggerate their social or environmental good. Just recently, many such brands faced public backlash when their supply chains or labor practices were exposed as unethical (The Guardian/Reuters, 2022-2023). Even the European Union has introduced stricter disclosure rules for sustainable finance products (Bloomberg Green, 2023), indicating rising global skepticism.

Here's the harsh reality: over 50% of 'social impact' startups fail to achieve their stated social goals within five years (Stanford Social Innovation Review, 2022). As Dr. Daina E. Eilertson, a Professor of Social Entrepreneurship, notes, 'Many so-called social impact startups are more focused on 'impact washing' – presenting a veneer of social good to attract millennial investors and talent – than on deep, systemic change' (Journal of Business Ethics, 2022). Also, a significant 15-30% of their budgets often go into marketing and fundraising, sometimes more than direct impact (Charity Navigator, 2023). Mr. Jed Emerson, co-author of 'The Blended Value Proposition,' rightly says that without 'clear, third-party verification, 'social impact' can become a buzzword for marketing, not a driver for change.'

This is very true in India too. We have a vibrant social enterprise sector addressing local challenges (NITI Aayog, 2022), but 'impact washing' is a growing trend among Indian startups, where CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) initiatives are used more for brand building than genuine, measurable change (The Economic Times, 2023). Aksar yeh hota hai ki achhe irade bhi sirf dikhawa ban jaate hain, jab asal mein kaam nahi hota. The lack of standardized impact measurement frameworks in India (Livemint, 2022) only makes it harder to tell genuine efforts from superficial claims.

So, what's the takeaway? It's crucial to look beyond the shiny mission statements and PR campaigns. While some companies truly strive for positive change, the venture capital model often prioritizes rapid growth over long-term social transformation (Mr. Anand Giridharadas, 'Winners Take All,' 2018). True social impact often comes from gritty, less glamorous work. Be a conscious consumer and investor by asking tough questions: what are the concrete metrics? Who verifies them? And what are the real incentives at play?

What are your thoughts? Have you encountered brands that you felt were genuinely impactful, or have you seen instances of 'impact washing'? How do you personally decide if a 'social impact' brand is trustworthy? Share your stories below!

How should I begin this ? Well, I'm a 31 year old man, looking for a committed long term relationship. The apps are terribly unkind (I've had a few matches, however) and people aren't willing to give each other a chance at all I feel. It's a bit of a catch-22 really, to build a connection with someone requires a little bit of patience and understanding, it's a two way street... So I figure I might as well try reddit, can't hurt right ?! I would like someone to show affection and a little bit of tenderness towards.

A little bit about me in dot point form:

* University educated, I have a double degree, engineering + science, now work in IT full time doing operations/infra work. 
* 173cm (5ft8in), black hair, brown eyes, I would call myself (somewhat?) conventionally attractive. I will let you decide that of course ! 
* Trying to get fitter, I go to the gym 4-5x a week, not overweight, but a little husky I guess? I have a powerlifting coach helping me to achieve a 2-plate bench within the next year. 
* I try to get enough sunshine, exercise, sleep, water, eat lots of fruit & veg. I hope you do too !
* Friendly, chatty, empathetic, curious, deep thinking (almost to a fault), emotionally available, honest and principled is how I would describe my character. 
* I prefer tea before coffee in the morning, I play acoustic guitar (but not enough, so I am terrible, still, I could sing you a song though !), I love my EDM of all varieties, trying to get my 5K time down, and I am also vegetarian. I drink socially. I have some vices, but happy to chat about that also. Just being upfront.
* Just fyi - never been in a relationship. I hope that's not a red flag ! It just hasn't happened, for whatever reason. 
* Progressive and left leaning, with some caveats, happy to explain. I believe in a higher power. 
* Not a gamer, into manga, anime, or super nerdy at all. I dont mind if you are though =)
* The book I am currently reading is *Siddhartha* by Herman Hesse. 

What I value, and hopefully you are:

* In that 25-35 age bracket, and from Australia. I don't mind where.
* Kind, curious, emotionally available, someone that rolls with the punches and doesn't sweat the small stuff.
* Employed, full time, preferably university educated.
* Looking for a monogamous, long-term relationship, built on mutually shared values, respect, integrity, and laughter (important!).
* I don't mind your cultural background, or skin colour. 
* Has an appreciation for science, art, music, technology ! 

Hopefully, we're not here for endless reddit chats lmao, shoot through a DM or chat request ! If we click, let’s meet in real life or close the gap if it’s a LDR (only open to this if it feels right), but lets talk ! I am happy to exchange pictures upon the first message =)

I’m posting on behalf of my partner because his symptoms are severe and we’re feeling pretty stuck. Hoping this community can help him with ideas and next steps. 

He’s 47M and has been struggling with what seems like MCAS for a couple of years. 

He has extreme fatigue, brain fog, breathing issues, itching… he has had days and weeks where he needs to nap for several hours a day, even when sleeping 8+ hours at night.

Recently he went on a strict low-histamine elimination diet, and he realized that it didn’t seem to be the type of food… it was EATING, itself, that caused him to crash out. He would get tight throat, itchy thumbs, sometimes a hive in his mouth, and then overwhelming sleepiness for hours. 

The only thing that reliably reduces his symptoms is fasting until evening, which he has been doing for months now, but now he's underweight and constantly hungry.  And he still sometimes gets brain fog and what he calls a “hangover” the next day from his dinner. But at least he can usually get through the day and function without sleeping all day. 

Does anyone else react to eating / digestion itself? How have you managed this if so?

Here’s what he’s tried/trying now:  He’s on daily H1 and H2 blockers. He also takes pantoprazole and fluoxetine, and has ADHD (medicated). Environmental triggers (dust, possibly mold exposure from a past apartment) seem to play a role, so he uses air purifiers and hypoallergenic bedding. He is taking NeuroProtek now also (contains Leuteolin and Quercetin). He drinks black coffee and water during the day. At night he tries his best to stick to low histamine foods, no leftovers. Mostly chicken, rice, oatmeal, bagels, a few veggies and fruits, and occasionally he binges out on a real meal for sanity & usually has regrets the next day. 

Because of breathing issues he wants to try Singulair/Montelukast. Has not yet tried Cromolyn sodium, DAO, ketotifen, LDN… Does not have health benefits (in Canada) nor a doctor who really gets this stuff. Has been tested for a barrage of “rule this and that out” stuff and all tests are negative/inconclusive.

No pressure, right?

A year and a half later, everything still looks new. My landlord even commented on it. Here's what actually works:

# Weekly routine (takes like 15 minutes total)

**Vacuum the sofa every week** \- This is honestly the biggest thing. My regular vacuum wasn't really cutting it, so I ended up getting one of those handheld pet hair vacuums (I have the Jigoo one but there are tons of options). The vibration feature actually makes a difference - pulls out hair that's worked into the fabric. Game changer for keeping things looking clean.

**Lint roller before guests** \- Keep one on the coffee table. 30 seconds and the sofa looks clean.

**Washable throws on favorite spots** \- My cat has her corner. Throw blanket goes there, gets washed weekly. Way easier than cleaning upholstery.

**The stuff that prevents disasters**  
**Trim nails every 2-3 weeks** \- One scratch session taught me this lesson the hard way.

**Enzyme cleaner for accidents** \- Keep it under the sink. Use IMMEDIATELY when something happens. Dab, spray, let it sit, blot. Has saved me multiple times.

**Baking soda once a month** \- Sprinkle on cushions, wait 20 min, vacuum up. Kills any pet smell.

**Open windows daily** \- Even 15 minutes makes a huge difference. Fresh air stops that ""pet apartment"" smell.

# Emergency kit under my sink

* Enzyme cleaner
* Microfiber cloths
* Lint roller refills
* Baking soda
* Soft brush

The trick is just staying on top of small stuff so you never have a huge mess. Weekly vacuuming + spot cleaning when needed = deposit secured.

**I got fired for accidentally being an asshole to the company owner's disabled daughter.**

&#x200B;


This happened on Friday. I've been drowning my sorrows all weekend, dreading the fact I have to start looking for a new job. Explaining why I got fired from my old job is going to be *fun*. I'm typing it up here to try and organize my thoughts in my head, because right now, it's all a mess.

I had been with the company for three months and was still on orientation. My job was sales/advertising. As the new guy, I was given existing accounts to manage, which consisted of providing customer service and convincing my clients to spend more money on advertising. All of these accounts already had their ad campaigns done, and if they wanted something new, the account was transferred to a senior account manager who would work with our advertising guys to put something together for the customer. Eventually, I hoped to have that job, but I had to pay my dues by proving I could maintain existing accounts and convince them to spend more money first.

Everything was going great, until last week, when we were scheduled to have our quarterly retreat. Since we were the main regional office in the area, all of the employees from the satellite locations came to our office for the retreat. The owner of the company rarely visits our office. He's been overseeing the set-up of a new satellite office for the last year, according to my co-workers. But, he was there for the retreat, as was his disabled daughter, Amy. (Not her real name, for the sake of privacy).

One of my co-workers told me Amy works at one of the satellite offices and I probably wouldn't have much interaction with her, but I should be nice. That seemed like a no-brainer. I'm nice to everyone, regardless. I won't claim to be an expert on Amy's disability, but it seemed like she had childlike mannerisms and struggled with expressing herself. She also had some problem with motor skills. I'll describe the only interaction I had with her prior to the ""incident.""

I went to refill my coffee and Amy was in front of me, getting her coffee. I watched her struggle with getting condiments added and putting the lid on, so I politely asked if she needed any help. She thanked me, said she did, and let me finish making it. While I was making it, she said she hated coffee, but her dad made her drink it because she had to (in a loud voice) Always Alert! I smiled, said that was definitely important, and handed her the cup. She thanked me again and went back to the office her dad was using, where she had been most of the day.

I felt like I had been a Good Samaritan and went on my way. Most of the retreat is teambuilding exercises. Prior to the incident, Amy only participated in the puzzle race, where groups put puzzles together without the box art to see which team can finish faster. Amy wasn't in my group, so I didn't have any interaction with her there. Neither of our teams won.

The big event, and the one that everyone seemed the most excited for, was the last activity of the day. Our boss gave us a list of potential clients, we were supposed to select three as a group, and put together something to attract the customer. We were told we would be judged on our creativity. My group explained that we could do pictures, slogans, jingles...whatever we wanted. Each person expected to work on one individually, then work with their group to polish it up before it was presented to everyone. It was kind of a big deal because at previous retreats, there would be clients on the list the owner was already close to bringing on board, and if you impressed the owner, you might just land that account.

I went with a jingle, rhymed a few words, and recorded it. It was silly but fit the brand. My group gave me some pointers, we made some improvements, and I recorded the final product for submission. I helped my team with their projects until it was time to turn everything in.

After everything was turned in, we gathered in the big conference room to critique each other. The owner went through them one by one. If it was a picture or storyboard, he'd put it up, read it, and we'd make comments. Good or bad. There were some that were great which drew a lot of compliments, and some that were really bad, which we laughed about as a group. You could tell the senior account managers didn't care much about the exercise or put much effort into their pitches.Nobody seem to get upset or offended, regardless of the feedback. When my jingle was played, it got a lot of comments, not all of them good, and I took the feedback with a smile.

After getting my feedback, I felt a little more comfortable about sharing my thoughts on other presentations. I gave what I thought was valuable feedback to a few products, laughed at a couple others, and then a rather crude drawing was put up for the exact same company I had chosen. I immediately joked that ""Well at least my jingle was better than that! Did a three year old draw it?"" and laughed...to absolute silence. I was really confused because plenty of people had made jokes and everyone laughed. Instead, a few people looked at my like I was disgusting and the owner said ""Well if you don't have anything nice to say, keep it yourself, maybe?"" Then my boss scooted down to where I was sitting and told me I needed to go to my desk. Now! I noticed as I was gathering my things that the owner's daughter was red faced and starting to tear up.

The team building exercise was over for me. I went back to my desk and it began to sink in that the drawing must have been drawn by the owner's daughter. There was no warning or anything. The owner didn't reveal who put together what we were looking at until after a few critiques. Maybe I should have known? Everyone was joking and having fun up to that point. Someone else had a pretty bad drawing that got laughed at. Either way, I felt awful. As soon as the event was over, I approached my boss to apologize. He told me to wait for him in his office.

Long story short, I was fired. My boss said since I was still on orientation, he had decided I wasn't a good fit for the company, so it was better to let me go now. He didn't outright say I was being fired for making fun of her drawing, but that's literally the only thing that I've ever gotten in trouble for. My work, up until that point, had been praised. I didn't get much time to process it because my boss had already called security, who showed up fairly quickly, and escorted me to my desk to gather my things before escorting me out of the building.

An hour later, I got a call from one of my former teammates, who asked if I wanted to join the team for a drink one last time. They needed it after the retreat, and felt bad that they didn't warn me. I wasn't feeling up for it, but I wanted to try and make sense of the whole situation, so I went to the bar. In the back of my mind, I was thinking that since I'm about to start looking for a new job, a few references from former co-workers wouldn't be bad since I definitely won't be getting one from my boss or the owner of the company after everything that happened.

The team explained that Amy comes to all of these retreats, and she always does some crude drawing like that. Everyone just sort of knows to say nice things about it, and move on. One of my teammates said that once you've seen one of her drawings, you know what to look for. Well I didn't, and nobody warned me. I started to get pretty upset that this was a known thing and everyone knew but me, but what could I do? I had already fucked up and it cost me my job.

The team also shared more about Amy. Apparently she works at one of the satellite offices but doesn't really do anything. The people in charge of the office try to come up with stuff for her to do because she gets upset when she's bored. The team said the way the people who worked there described it, they were basically her babysitter so she wouldn't bother her dad all day when he spent most of his time there, and after he moved on to establish the new satellite office, he didn't take Amy with him because she liked all the friends she had at that office.

They also said that her dad had harassed a few single guys at the office to take her on dates, which seemed pretty damn HR inappropriate, but he does own the company. My team said Amy desperately wants a boyfriend and wants to get married, which she talks about all the time. The consensus seemed to be that there's no way she actually understands how relationships or marriage works, and her dad probably put this idea in her head to begin with. One of my teammates did joke that it wasn't a bad deal, because whoever married her would inherit the company since she is the old man's only kid. I wasn't really in the mood for jokes at that point after losing my job over one, so I told them I needed to go.

The only good thing is my former team members did say they would gladly give me a reference if I needed it, since they felt so bad about not telling me about the Amy situation to begin with.

Oh, and the cherry on top? Amy sent me a Facebook friend request over the weekend.

I haven't accepted it. I already upset her and it cost me my job. Part of me wants to accept it, apologize, and block her, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that either.

I'm going to take a few days to get myself together and then get my resume out there.


Edit: After reading all of the replies, including quite a few DMs, and talking with a close friend, I've decided that I'm going to accept the friend request. I'll do an update if there's any sort of conversation. I plan to open with an apology. If she replies, great. If she doesn't, then at least I will have a clear conscious knowing I've done the right thing.

*Word to the wise: never ever add work people as Facebook friends unless you absolutely are friends. Also I wouldn’t tell people in your interview that story perhaps something more along the lines of you were in a probationary period and unfortunately did not get hired on after the probation or something similar. Keep it vague.*


**MissDkm**

*Underrated comment, I feel that the fact you were employed at this job for such a minimal time that you may not even want to include it on your resume, like you said, you were still on a probationary period when you were let go. I think it may look worse to employers to see a job you were only at for 3 months and find out its because you were fired (and then you having to explain it away in and interview), then if you told them you were unemployed for 3 more months longer (then was true) to get a legitimate interview at a worthwhile company...Something like this is such a small blip in an employment past it barely exists...of course every situation is different and this may not be the best advice for your situation, I personally couldn't allow myself to worry about or give power to effect my future jobs, such a dumb situation. . ..*

**Update - 1 day later**

&#x200B;



UPDATE: I got fired for accidentally being an asshole to the company owner's disabled daughter.
If you saw my first post, you know that I got fired because I accidentally made a joke at the expense of the company owner's disabled daughter, Amy. During the last teambuilding event of the day, we were pitching ideas for accounts, which included everything from jingles (my pitch) to storyboards to slogans to drawings. A lot of senior account managers were phoning it in, and people were making jokes about their work, which had a lot of people laughing. I got some jokes about my pitch, and got a little overconfident, so when a crude drawing went up for the same account I did my jingle for, I made a joke about it. The joke was ""Well at least my jingle was better than that! Did a three year old draw it?"" My joke was met with stone cold silence, and a very negative reaction from the owner of the company.

What my co-workers had failed to tell me was that Amy usually submits a crude drawing, which is a lot of work for her due to her issues, and everyone knows to say a few nice things and move on. I was new and wasn't informed, so my ignorance and inappropriate response cost me my job. After meeting with my team at a bar to begin the process of drowning my sorrows, I got a friend request from Amy on Facebook.

That brings us the to the update.

----------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, thank you to everyone who made me laugh. The first time someone joked about me accepting the friend request, marrying Amy, and taking my revenge by inheriting the company made me uncomfortable. By the third time I saw it mentioned, I couldn't help but laugh.

A lot of you gave me good advice. I appreciate those who talked about legal action and what options I had. Unfortunately, I was still on orientation with my company, which is like a probationary period. During that time, they can let me go for any reason. They could fire me for wearing the wrong color socks if they wanted. I had to sign an agreement to get employed which stated I understood this. There's literally nothing I can do, legally.

At the end of the day, I decided to go have some drinks with a good friend, talk things out, and see what he would do. Dave's been my best friend since we were in elementary school. We've probably spent more time together than some actual brothers. Dave was firmly on the side of ""accept the friend request, apologize, and clear your conscious, man. I'm getting us another round of shots."" He knows me better than anyone, and he knows that the guilt would eat me alive. I posted it here because it bothered me. I decided to take his advice, and everyone here who pushed me for that as well, especially the ones that DM'd me.

So, that's what I did. I accepted the friend request. I immediately messaged Amy. I said I shouldn't have made that joke about anyone's work, it was unprofessional, and I was sorry. It took her a while to respond, but when she finally did, she thanked me for my apology, but said she sent me the request because she wanted to apologize since I lost my job over it. I said she didn't owe me an apology, and there was another long pause before she asked if she could copy/paste something to me. I wasn't sure what it was, but said she could.

She pasted a generic message, but one she had clearly spent some time on. I don't want to type it word-for-word, but I'll paraphrase:

""Hi, my name is Amy. Please forgive me if I'm slow to respond to you. I suffered a brain injury when I was a little girl and it takes me a while to type things out.""

There was more to it, but that's the basic stuff. I responded, saying it was not a problem, and she could take all the time she needed.

Amy and I ended up messaging back and forth until almost 3am. No, we didn't fall in love. We aren't going on a date. I'm not going to marry her for revenge so I can take her dad's company. However, I do think I would like to be friends with her. Not because I feel bad for her, but because she's a genuinely nice person and honestly, everyone could use a few friends like that.

We spent a lot of time talking about her. That's just the direction it went, so I asked questions since she seemed comfortable talking about it.

Amy was in a car accident when she was a kid. She was in the car with her mom and they were hit by a drunk driver, coming back from a birthday party for one of her classmates. Her mom didn't make it, and Amy suffered a brain injury that impacts her motor skills. Because it makes it difficult for her to speak and do simple things like getting dressed, making coffee, etc., people assume she's mentally challenged. She was put in Special Ed because of it, but worked really hard and graduated from high school. She even wanted to go to college but her dad didn't think it was a good idea.

Her life has been difficult because it's hard for her to communicate with people. By the time she can get a fully formed sentence out, the conversation is over. She can type, slowly, but most people don't want to type when they're face-to-face. She even admitted that when she's not at work, she will sometimes carry a tablet and pretend she's mute, because that's just easier.

We eventually circled back to the drawing and my terrible response to it. She wasn't that offended by my response, because she assumed I didn't know. She got upset, primarily, because she knew all hell was about to break loose and she had no way to communicate with anyone. She was so upset when she found out I got fired, and tried to talk to her dad, but he wouldn't listen to her. She's fully aware that a lot of people at the company just pretend to be nice to her because she's the owner's daughter, but she does have a few friends at the satellite office where she works who better understand her disability.

She gets frustrated because she can't truly contribute anything, but is happy when they are able to find busy-work for her to do. It might take her all day to do something another person could do in a couple of hours, but it's better than sitting around bored all day. She knows she's a burden and a bother to her dad when he's around, but he's her dad and she loves him. She wishes every single day she was a daughter he could be proud of, rather than a burden. She tries talking to him via emails and text messages, but he usually doesn't respond. If they're in the same location, he'll just walk over and respond verbally, which is frustrating, because it becomes a one-sided discussion with her unable to do anything but give simple one-word answers like yes or no. She also thanked me again for helping with her coffee. She said that when she was younger, she tried to do everything by herself, and would get mad when people helped her, but now she's learned to appreciate the few who do. Most just stand there and look away, pretending to patiently wait for her to do it on her own.

It was getting late for both of us at that point. Really late. It takes her a long time to respond to messages. There's misspellings. I get why someone would assume she's mentally challenged. I myself referred to her in my first post as having ""childlike"" mannerisms, which was a misunderstanding on my part. When she tries to force words quickly or emphasize something, she gets really loud, which makes her sound like a excited toddler rather than an adult trying to have a conversation.

We ended our talk last night agreeing to talk again sometime. She asked if I had watched the first episode of House of Dragon yet, which I have, and she asked if I'd like to talk about it after she watches it. I told her I'd love to.

So that's it, that's the update. Sorry to those who expected me to steal her dad's company. I'm definitely not doing that. Talking to Amy did make me feel a lot better though. I don't know how I'm going to handle the whole firing thing at my next interview, but a few of you suggested I just leave a gap on my resume, and I may just do that.

I doubt there will be any future updates, but at least this has a happier ending than my first post.

TL;DR since a few asked for it in my first post: I lost my job, but I may have gained a friend.


Edit: She loved House of Dragon.

*Wonderful update, thank you.
It breaks my heart to hear how Amy's dad treats her, he doesn’t even care to listen to, understand and get to know his own daughter. Seems to me like he disrespects and belittles her. I mean, how DARE he stop her from going to college? Ugh, he is essentially discriminating his own kid due to her disability. It makes me real sad and mad.*

>OOP:
The college thing honestly pissed me off. Especially now when she could essentially just do it online if she needed to.

**Day_Bow_Bow**

*Hey OP. My coworker has a nonverbal autistic son, and he uses what's called an AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) tablet to communicate. The screen looks something like this.
There's a bunch of different versions for varying degrees of disability. The one I linked is considerably more complex than her boy had. This one is more for adult traumatic brain injury, which seemed better suited for her situation.
My coworker had a specialized tablet with a plastic grid overlay that outlined the on-screen buttons, which helped him not hit the wrong one.
When looking for the name of the device and a picture, I saw mention of iPad apps (no clue about how well those works) and a touchscreen laptop combo.
She might appreciate you asking her thoughts on the matter.*

>OOP:
Someone else mentioned this too. I'm going to look into it. I might even bring it up tonight after we finish talking about House of Dragon. She loved it!

I built **The Café Academy**, a platform designed to help home baristas make better coffee at home. I provide clear, step-by-step guides on espresso, milk steaming, bean selection, and equipment use, so that anyone can consistently brew coffee that tastes like it came from a café.

I created this because I want coffee drinkers to enjoy the **same great drink every time they brew**. Many home brewers struggle with inconsistent shots, weak milk foam, or confusing equipment, so I will be building guides that are practical, technique-focused, and easy to follow for anyone looking to brew coffee specifically home brewers.

I’d love feedback on a few things:

* Which parts of home coffee brewing do you find most confusing or frustrating?
* What kind of content would you like to see more of — brewing guides, equipment reviews, troubleshooting tips, or something else?
* Do you think a dedicated resource like this adds real value for home coffee enthusiasts?

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated — I want to make this as useful as possible for the community!

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

HUZZAH!!!!!,"Hey all, been struggling with burnout and stress and anxiety and and and and and my executive dysfunction has basically taken over. I have been doing the absolute bare minimum for...probably over a year now.

But! I have finally been able to make some progress on doing things! Have obviously been trying different things to help, but honestly meds, trying to not talk shit about myself to myself, and my trusty SAD plant lamp probably take most of the credit.

And all that incremental progress is great but really easy to dismiss in the moment as not a big deal, you know? And then earlier today, I woke up, made coffee, looked around my kitchen and went ""hmmmmm....""

(I'm going to give you waaaay too much detail about all the things I accomplished because I'm torn between patting myself on the back, disbelief that I actually got all that done, and wanting to cry because holy crap has it been a long time since I didn't have to fight my brain to do the most basic things.)

BOOM! Stripped the guest beds, including mattress and pillowcase covers. Got first load of laundry going. BOOM! While that was in the machine, I cleared, tidied, and scrubbed down the kitchen counter and dining table. Took a break to enjoy coffee and a smoke on the front porch. BOOM! Dumped dryer load on the now-clean dining table, switched laundry, threw second load in wash (full guest rooms laundry is 5 loads). BOOM! Filled sink with hot soapy water and set the stove burner-cover-widgets in there to soak. Sprayed down the stovetop with windex (don't judge me, this is not the cleaning sub), and scrubbed the top, front, handles, everything visible, then scrubbed the burner-wodgets and left those to dry. I WAS DONE WITH THE WINDEX SO I PUT AWAY WHERE IT BELONGS. Swept kitchen, swapped laundry, third load in, folded what came out the dryer, took it back upstairs.

Came back down, wet-swiffered the kitchen floor for the first time in at least six months (I think my boyfriend kindly did it for me sometime in the spring while I had a sobbing meltdown over my inability to do things on the front porch). Stepped out on the front porch for another smoke break while that dried. Went back in, tidied front entryway/living room, swept. Swept upstairs hallway. Vacuumed upstairs rugs. BROUGHT THE VACUUM BACK DOWNSTAIRS WHERE IT BELONGS. Swapped laundry, fourth load in. It's now noon on a Sunday, I've been going since about 6am. Wet-swiffered the hardwoods floors in the now-swept entryway, living room, and upstairs hallway. Swiffer myself out the front door and go for lunch around the corner while that dries.

Come back, put half of 4th load in the dryer (sheets and quilts, gotta break em up or they don't dry), bring mattress covers back upstairs and put them on the beds. Have a break. Throw second half of 4th load in the dryer, put in fifth load. Pause for nap roulette.

Seriously. Like, it's not all done but, I feel a million times better. My house *feels* brighter. I'm going to go scrub toilets and clean both bathrooms and I am *excited* about this, because it means that my house is clean and I get to enjoy that and I DID IT, I MADE THE THING I AM ENJOYING.

Fingers crossed this is an actual corner turned in my burnout recovery and not just a false spring situation, but holy crap it is encouraging. I had forgotten what this feels like.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

My mum finally thinks my LinkedIn activity is legit.,"Favikon just dropped their “Who’s Who” report and somehow my name wandered into the mix. I had to read it twice just to make sure they weren’t profiling another Tony who also talks a lot about people at work.

Huge thanks to the Favikon team for shining a light on creators who actually care about conversations and not theatre. The level of detail in the report, especially around authenticity, means a lot because it reflects the heart of this community. You’ve built a platform that doesn’t just score numbers. It recognises voices, intent and impact. That’s rare.

To everyone in my orbit, near and far, thank you. Every comment, DM, laugh, disagreement and occasional “Tony what are you doing posting at 12 midnight on a Saturday” keeps this space alive. I started sharing thoughts because I believed work could feel more human. You turned that into a movement.

If this report says anything, it’s that community beats algorithms every single time. I’m just one person with a phone, a few stories, plenty of coffee and a commitment to show up as I am. You’re the ones who turn posts into conversations and conversations into real change.

So here’s to more honest chats, more culture-shaping moments and more people-first leadership across LinkedIn. And yes, more videos because we all need a little comic relief between meetings.

Thank you Favikon. Thank you, community. Let’s keep going.

I have nobody to talk to at home. When my partner isn’t working away from home, he just isn’t a conversationalist. At work I repeat the same phrases off a script. The only acquaintances I’ve made have been through my partner or my in laws. I keep trying to come up with solutions to my loneliness problem but unfortunately they’re not gonna be able to happen until we have a second car, which isn’t happening in the foreseeable future.

However somehow when I bring up the loneliness, it gets brought into “Are you unhappy with me?” Like…no? How?

He said it worked the time he tested and made nice espresso. He doesn't drink coffee a lot but i do. So I've never used an espresso maker but i thought I'll give it a go. I gave it a good rinse I loaded it up with local ground coffee(which i use for my moka pot) until the mark given within it and filled a proper amount of water. Turned it on and a minute later, it brewed some espresso. 


That espresso was dogshit. Like the worst espresso I've ever had. It was way too bitter and i couldn't taste anything other than bitterness. I thought maybe the first time it's shit coz some residue might have been inside and i gave it a good clean and let it dry overnight. The next day i used a bit more water coz the device was giving a lot of steam which i thought was ruining the coffee. This time there was minimal steam. And yet the coffee was dogshit. I've made espresso using the same coffee powder in the moka pot and it's quite good when made in the moka pot. But this espresso maker's coffee is the worst. 



Am I still making any mistake in making espresso or is the device too old or has any problem? Should I ditch it and go back to moka pot?


I don't wanna give up coz this device saves me a bit of time and it's a bit care free when compared to a moka pot. But the coffee is shit. And I just wanna know if I'm the problem.

However, addiction runs STRONG in my family history, particularly alcoholism. I have been to detoxes, rehabs, hospitals. Spent thousands of dollars. And at very low and desperate times I tried AA twice… in two different cities. During both of those times I developed an intense sense of shame (something I never had struggled with, as I didn’t grow up in a shame based family or religion). It really did a number on my people pleasing and perfectionism. It’s an all or nothing mentality. The day counting, relapses, starting over in the big book. At the end of it, I had been through two sponsors over a year and a half. Lots of telling me I would lose everything if I didn’t do the steps, that I would end up dead or in jail. The idea was no AA, no dreams would come true. But it just didn’t feel right to me. It was fear based and shame based, and I basically said “fuck this” and never looked back a year ago.

Fast forward to today, I live a very balanced life. I am in grad school. I have rebuilt old friendships and made new friends (most aren’t in recovery themselves and are very supportive). I got a dog who gives me comfort and purpose. I started dating again. I workout instead of going to meetings. And this alone has drastically improved my overall happiness and self-esteem. I am able to go out with people who do drink and not give a shit about it/not want to myself. Basically, all of the “promises” that they say only come with doing the steps have happened for me because I decided I wanted to change my own life by utilizing my time wisely. 

It wasn’t god. It was me. It didn’t happen overnight. There are still times I get flashbacks of my low points and all the dumb shit I did when I was in active addiction. But I have therapy and proper medication that help me get out of defeatist thinking.

What didn’t help:
- meetings and the steps and talking about alcoholism 24/7
- fucking day counting
- reading the big book over and over and over
- shame and worry and fear
- rehashing all of the times I’ve fucked up in my life

What actually helped since quitting AA:
- naltrexone
- sleep medication for my insomnia
- therapy with a licensed professional
- exercise, especially in nature
- cooking and eating healthily
- REAL friends and community, coffee with these friends, dinners, movies, etc
- positive thinking and affirmations
- meditation
- music and art in general
- setting goals and achieving them
- reading
- drinking tea at night instead of alcohol

TLDR: You don’t need a god or sky daddy to stop drinking or change your life. You don’t have to live in fear or shame or regrets. You can fucking do this.

So I swung by Target tonight and picked up the ONLY My K-Cup version they had: the new 3.0 2025 version. The manual insists that it is compatible with all Keurig brewers EXCEPT for the Keurig 2.0 models. Ours is the K-Classic so it *should* work but it fucking doesn’t. Am I stupid or am I missing something here? ,1,1763965409.0,keurig,1,1.0,False
