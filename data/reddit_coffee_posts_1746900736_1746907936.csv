I recently bought a Silvia Pro X and Niche Zero. The shots don't seem to be pulling correctly. I'm grinding 18g of medium roast coffee beans in the Niche Zero, pouring the grounds into the portafilter with a dosing funnel, tapping to level the grinds, using a WDT tool to break up clumps and distribute, then pressing firmly down with the tamper using a rubber mat. The brew boiler is coming up to the original set point of 93, I put the portafilter in to the 5 oclock position, press the brew button and...

First attempt: I didn't tighten the portafilter enough so it leaked during the soft infusion.

Second attempt: I tightened it correctly, grind setting was at 15 on the NZ in the espresso range, but the coffee trickled out very slowly until the mahine hit its 90 second safety cutoff time. Barely got any coffee out after all that time.

Third attempt: figured maybe I ground too fine, adjusted the grind on the NZ to 20, it took ~56s to get to ~36g out. Pretty long. And very sour.

What's going on here? I thought too fine = too slow, too coarse = too fast, too coarse = sour.

The pressure gauage shows low bar during soft infusion and then gets up to around 9 bar during the shot.

Is something wrong with my machine? I got it from Chris' coffee and am still within the 30 day return window. Otherwise, any suggestions if its something I'm doing wrong?",1,1746907690.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1kjj3ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/route66/comments/1kjj3ht/the_food_of_route_66/,The Food of Route 66,"I'm an independent food writer, and I'm planning to drive route 66 in a couple of weeks with a focus on unique, historic, and/or regional food along the route, and I'm planning to write a book or an article about the experience. I wanted to get a little feedback from the folks here who might know a thing or two about this topic. tried to limit this, as much as possible, to spots that were opened before the route was officially decommisioned.

Here's my planned list of spots - let me know what you think! Is there anything that's just terribly overrated? Is there anything I'm missing that's absolutely crucial? 

And is there a good way to plan this that minimizes the greasy food? I accept that that's how roadfood is gonna be to some extent, but eating a horseshoe in Springfield followed by a slinger in St Lous followed by a chicken fried steak in Oklahoma three days in a row sounds downright hazardous. I'll also be splitting most of these things with my wife, not eating a whole portion myself.

Three years ago, I started a game studio with **Richard Garfield**, the creator of *Magic: the Gathering* and someone who inspired me to take up game design as a career. Since we decided to make our studio fully remote, I had to find various spots in LA to work on building our first game.

And that turned out to be one of the best decisions for Chaos Agents. Writing code for Chaos Agents in coffee shops (shoutout to all the late-night K-town, DTLA, and WeHo spots catering to us local nomads), bars and hotel lobbies (The Line Hotel is a magical place to get stuff done, trust me) gave me the type of creative inspiration that only Los Angeles can.

We did our first LAN party in SF during GDC, and that was an [absolute blast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH-YCUZnmjA), so we decided to do another one in LA. (and Boston during PAX East).

Richard and I would be thrilled if you guys came over to check out the game and participate in the ongoing Chaos World Championship with cash prizes over $1,500 along with many other rewards.

We'll have food, drinks, and an all-around LAN party atmosphere, so bring your friends too! Also for showing up, you'll get one of 5000 private Alpha keys for Chaos Agents, that also gives you perpetual access to Chaos Agents, including its Early Access and full release.

But my baby didn't need that imaginary perfect mom. They needed me, exactly as I was.

The second sentence became my morning mantra: ""My feelings are valid - even the hard ones."" For weeks, I had been pushing down the difficult emotions, plastering on a smile when visitors came, pretending everything was fine. This simple phrase gave me permission to be honest. To admit that yes, sometimes motherhood feels overwhelming. And that's okay.

The third one emerged from my darkest days: ""I'm growing every day - small steps are still progress."" On days when just taking a shower felt like climbing Mount Everest, this reminder kept me going. Because sometimes, getting out of bed IS the win. Sometimes, managing to drink a warm cup of coffee IS the achievement. And that's perfectly fine.

In-Depth Review,"Testing out the **10X Health System 5 MTHF Supplement** felt like adding a little boost of vitality to my daily routine. I got the chance to delve into its promises of brain and heart health support, neurotransmitter synthesis, and a whole lot more. It wasn’t just about swallowing a few capsules; it was about seeing how daily supplementation with methylated multivitamins could impact my energy, focus, and overall wellness. Let’s dive into the nitty-gritty of what worked, what didn’t, and how it stacks up in an overflowing market of supplements.

**Hands-On Insights into Design and Formulation**  
As someone who has experimented with various vitamins over the years, the formulation here stands out for its choice of **5-MTHF**, which is a bioavailable form of folate. Unlike folic acid, which requires conversion in the body, 5-MTHF skips past all the guesswork and gets absorbed directly. That’s great news for people like my coworker who happen to struggle with folic acid absorption. The capsules themselves are easy to swallow, which is something I do not take for granted, given my past battles with clunky, oversized supplements. Plus, its gluten-free design opens the door for a wider audience, especially for those with dietary restrictions.

**Benefits**  
- Enhanced nutrient absorption thanks to bioavailable methylfolate.  
- Gluten-free and clean formulation suitable for sensitive diets.  
- A full two-month supply in one bottle, making it hassle-free.

**Performance and Daily Use**  
Incorporating this methylfolate supplement into my mornings was simple. Within a couple of weeks, I noticed subtle changes in my mood and energy levels. For someone who guzzles coffee just to avoid the dreaded mid-afternoon crash, this felt like a step toward balance. The promise of boosting neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine seemed valid—I wasn’t leaping with joy but experienced a pleasant sort of clarity that made tackling projects more enjoyable. On energy, it wasn’t like a caffeinated jolt but a slow, steady increase throughout the day.

**Drawbacks**  
- Results take time to notice and aren’t instant.  
- People looking for flavored options might find it boring.  
- Might not fully justify the investment for those who don’t have precise nutritional deficiencies.

**Target Audience**  
Clearly, this product caters to a specific group of people, particularly those who need additional folate for DNA synthesis and homocysteine regulation. If you’re pregnant, managing heart health, or need mental performance enhancers, this hits several of those checkboxes. On the flip side, if you’re someone without specific deficiencies or are already using other multivitamin formulations, the overlap might make it less essential.

**Pros**  
- Boosts neurotransmitter synthesis for steady mood improvement.  
- Helps regulate cardiovascular functions by supporting homocysteine levels.  
- Provides a long shelf life and a sufficient dose-per-bottle ratio.

[Curious about 10X Health System 5 MTHF Supplement? Check price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0d5zh1fxz/)  

**Downsides**  
- As with many supplements, consistent use over time is key to seeing results.  
- A lack of flavor options might make daily consumption monotonous for some.  

**Competing Products**  
For comparison, I’ve tried several other folate supplements, and a frequent rival to this one often ends up being Thorne Research Methyl Guard. Thorne’s pills have a slightly higher folate content per capsule and cater especially to people with the MTHFR gene mutation, but they’re a little harder to come by and tend to lean expensive. Brands like Nature Made also deliver folate-based pills, but their use of synthetic folic acid puts some at a disadvantage if absorption is critical. In terms of safety testing and purity assurance, this 10X supplement really does hold its ground.

**Financial Value**  
When considering cost efficiency, this product sits in a sweet spot between more affordable yet less bioavailable options and high-end alternatives that pack in a bunch of unnecessary extras. Think of it as rewarding smart spending—solid features at a reasonable margin. Is it budget-friendly enough to justify replacing generic folate pills? If you want clinically-supported outcomes and better bioavailability, the answer leans toward yes.

You know those mornings when getting out of bed feels impossible? I remember them all too well. During my darkest days with PPD, I started something so simple that it almost seemed silly at first - I kept a notebook by my bed. Nothing fancy, just a dollar store notebook that quickly became covered in coffee stains and baby spit-up. Every morning, I'd write just one word about how I was feeling. Just one. Sometimes it was ""tired"" or ""scared"" or even just ""blah."" But that tiny act of acknowledging my feelings became my anchor.

Looking back now, I can see how these tiny moments of self-care and awareness gradually helped me find my way through the fog. It wasn't about dramatic changes or perfect routines. It was about finding those small moments of peace in the chaos of new motherhood.

Everything was great, we had so much in common, and he told me that he was really glad to meet me. He texted me several times after the date, but with big delay,s and I also made my interest clear by telling him that I was open to seeing him again since I enjoyed the evening a lot.

1kjipuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1kjipuh/boston_to_bermuda_jewel_review/,Boston to Bermuda Jewel Review,"TL;DR: NCL is probably no longer a line we'll choose. Food mediocre at best, insufficient entertainment, wrong demographic for our group. But Bermuda is still lovely if you know where to go!

General summary: four adults with about a dozen or so cruises between us on RCL, NCL, HAL, Celebrity, and Viking. We like to eat well, drink moderately, socialize, and relax onboard. 

Unfortunately, this wasn't the cruise for us. Nearly 90% of our fellow passengers fell into the ""overfed"" and ""nearly dead"" categories which made navigating around the ship a nightmare tangle of walkers, scooters, and other mobility devices used by people who could not or sometimes would not unblock the hallways. This older ship was literally not built to accommodate, and while in and of itself that's an accessibility problem, it also really sucked for everyone trying to just walk around. 

The extremely obvious and offensive political tee shirts didn't help our charitable thoughts either. Some overheard conversations were downright gross. 

We made our own fun and enjoyed quite a bit of relaxing downtime... in our staterooms. 

Here we go: 

The cruise: Boston to Bermuda on NCL Jewel, May 2025. 

Cabin 8/10: deck 9 balcony and no major complaints. Comfy bed, excellent water pressure and hot water in shower. Needs a small table in front of the lounge chair for food/drink trays. 

Cleanliness 9/10: ship mostly kept spotlessly clean, with occasional lag time in clearing at the buffet. Washy washy, happy happy. 

Crew 6/10: what a mixed bag. The breakfast Coffee Queens, our server and sommelier at Cagney's, and our stateroom attendants were delightful. Bartenders were quick but not friendly even with cash tips. Entire staff at O'Sheehans must have had a reeeeeeally bad day because we almost left due to abrupt rudeness and zero service. Weird altercations spotted between staff and management right next to guests. 

Drinks 7/10: extremely hit or miss. Undrinkable paloma and mojito, delicious mango frozen cocktail and surprisingly tasty menu of nonalcoholic but creative mocktails. Wine list predictably subpar, but we're wine snobs. 

Food 5/10: yikes. MDR inedible (AND poor service). O'Sheehans nearly inedible. Buffet reliable for all three meals, nice variety and quite fresh. Cagney's good, but they failed one cooking temp out of three (rare when order was medium). Moderno fine, pork too dry to eat but the rest tasty. Teppanyaki great food and fun experience but way, WAY too loud to make it a comfortable two hours. Chin Chin had great sushi and apps but entrees were ick. Generally food was bland and underseasoned. 

Shows 6/10: of the three company shows, one aerial dance couple, and one comedian, we enjoyed the ""adult"" comedian show and two of the company shows. Choreography is laughably bad but the dancers still did well and the life band borrowed from the jazz band were a highlight. One female lead vocalist was good, the other mediocre. Skip the creepy aerial dance couple unless you want to laugh in a sad way. 

Daily onboard experience 4/10: worst daily list of ""activities"" we've ever seen. Almost everything was gambling or pay to play. The jazz band was solid but all other performers were truly amateur. 

On shore: no rating because we didn't book excursions. As frequent Bermuda visitors we preferred to handle island time ourselves. One highlight: NCL owns a ferry to take you from the Dockyard to St. Georges, and that's a hugely convenient option. 

Overall 6/10: we had a good time in spite of the cruise, not because of it. I think Virgin will be our next target, which will perhaps solve many of our complaints. Sorry NCL, you lost us.

1kjio7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetReviewHub/comments/1kjio7h/explore_why_the_benfuchen_3in1_coffee_machine/,Explore why the Benfuchen 3-in-1 coffee machine review is a game-changer!,"The Benfuchen 3-in-1 Coffee Machine, specifically the ""Portable Espresso Maker 3-in-1 Coffee Machine,"" caught my eye as I was searching for a coffee solution for my on-the-go lifestyle. I’ve had a streak of bad luck with portable coffee makers in the past, but I decided to give this one a shot. It promised a versatile design, compatibility with various coffee capsules and grounds, and portability—a potentially perfect fit for someone who’s always moving but refuses to sacrifice java quality. Did it brew the fresh cup of convenience I was hoping for? Mostly, yes, but there’s a twist in the story.

### **Design and Portability**  
Talk about a machine that knows how to travel well! This thing is lightweight—just 1.5 pounds—and fits so snugly in my backpack, it made carrying it around feel like carrying a water bottle (and honestly took up less space than a thermos). Its dimensions (2.95 x 2.95 x 8.98 inches) are compact but functional. It’s made for movement, with a leakproof, waterproof construction that alleviates fears of coffee leaks messing up my luggage—trust me, I’ve had my fair share of those disasters in the past. Its sleek and minimalist design doesn’t scream “gadget overload,” so it doesn’t feel cluttered or overwhelming on your counter or desk.  

While I appreciate the utility of the compactness, I noticed the materials used don’t exactly feel premium. It’s sturdy enough to withstand daily use, camping, or tossing it into your bag for a day trip, but the plastic components didn’t inspire long-term confidence about durability.  

### **Performance on the Go**  
Here’s where the Benfuchen 3-in-1 Espresso Machine shines and stumbles. It’s equipped with 17-bar stable pressure extraction for my favorite coffee capsules (I tried it with Nespresso ones), and the crema it extracted was surprisingly rich. That thick golden foam layering on the top? Chef’s kiss. It’s also compatible with Dolce Gusto pods and plain ol’ ground coffee. Flexibility is the name of the game here, and I leaned heavily into that because my mood tends to swing between trying fancy bougie pods and sticking to good DIY grounds.  

Coffee aficionados, raise a brow now: there is a HUGE caveat here—**this machine does not heat water.** Yup, no heating function exists, so you need to pre-boil water separately. I admit, that felt like a slap in the face initially. Once I adjusted my expectations and got a small thermos with hot water on hand, it worked smoothly. The one-button operation is straightforward, but let’s not ignore how small missteps (forgetting hot water or over-packing grounds) can mess up the experience.  

[Check Benfuchen 3-in-1 Coffee Machine deals on Amazon now.](https://usegadgets.com/p/b0dq3x3hw6/)  

### **Battery Life and Charging**  
The battery talk truly got me excited. It comes with a USB-C charging system, which is just universal enough these days. It fully charges in just one hour. After a full charge, I managed to brew well over 80 cups, though admittedly those were smaller espressos as its design focuses on single-person usage. It’s an excellent feature if you’re about that wanderlust life, hopping between flights or hiking trails. Charging through your car charger makes it even more road trip-friendly.  

What about performance outdoors? I couldn’t find major drawbacks—this thing functioned despite being jostled around. That’s usually where portable devices fail, and this one stood firm.  

### **Favorable Aspects**  
- Versatility: Works with Nespresso capsules, Dolce Gusto pods, and ground coffee.  
- Lightweight and super portable, excellent for campers or business travelers.  
- Uses advanced 17-bar pressure for rich, creamy shots.  
- One-hour charge powers over 80 brews—USB-C for universal convenience.  

### **Areas for Improvement**  
- No water heating feature; separate preparation required.  
- Plasticky body feels less durable for heavy, daily use.  
- Single-cup capacity makes it unsuitable for group coffee sessions.  

### **Competing Products**  
I compared this portable marvel to Wacaco’s Nanopresso and the Staresso Portable Espresso Maker—two equally popular choices in this space. Nanopresso has a more durable build and honestly feels better made for rugged use, yet it lacks compatibility with Dolce Gusto pods and requires manual pumping. Staresso does a stellar job at brewing iced coffee along with hot espresso, but its versatility with capsules isn’t as expansive. Here, Benfuchen has the edge of offering multi-functionality across coffee types at a lower comparative weight and price range. On the flip side, competitors win in terms of not requiring separate hot water preparation, a striking disadvantage of the product in question.

### **Cost Efficiency**  
Whether the price makes sense depends on your perspective. For a portable coffee solution, the machine delivers reasonable features, though the omitted heating function may sway some buyers to look elsewhere. Environmental factors give it bonus points, considering the machine’s reusable design. Making my brews instead of purchasing coffeeshop lattes saves heaps of money over months of usage, perfect for frugal coffee enthusiasts out there.

1kjikxn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjikxn,Do I really need a Settings screen in my app?,"Why every app needs a well-thought-out Settings screen — and how it can actually make or break your success.  
  
Short : YES. Long : It can make your app feel 2x more trustworthy, useful, and sticky.  
Psychology behind it + dos & don’ts

\+ Settings = Ownership  
  
When users can tweak things (theme, notifications, data, privacy),  
they feel in control.  
Control = comfort.  
Comfort = trust.  
Trust = they stay.

\+ It tells your user: “You’re important here.”  
  
Even a simple toggle like ""dark mode"" or ""reminder time"" shows that you’re thinking about different use cases and personal needs.  
  
It’s like saying:  
 “We designed this with you in mind.”

\+ It’s where you hide complexity… beautifully.  
  
Too many options on the main screen?  
Dumping them on users = friction.  
Solution?  
Tuck them into Settings.  
Let the power users explore.  
Let casual users stay focused.   
Everyone wins.

\+ What should be in a Settings screen?  
  
 Notifications (on/off, frequency)  
 App Theme (dark/light/system)  
 Account info + logout  
 Language (if global)  
 Feedback/Support  
 Premium info (if any)

\+ What NOT to put there?  
  
 Critical features users need every time  
 App navigation (Settings ≠ Menu)  
 Hidden pricing tricks  
 Ads or promotions  
“Rate us” pop-ups spammed there  
Make it helpful, not a junk drawer.

\+ Want loyal users? Add this 1 underrated thing:  
  
 A “Remind me” toggle with custom time.  
  
Habit, task, wellness, or journaling apps THRIVE on nudges.  
Let users pick their own reminder time. It’ll triple their return rate.

\+ Settings build the bridge between UX & support  
Add:  
 A way to contact you  
 App version info  
 Privacy Policy / Terms  
 Restore purchases (for IAPs)  
It smooths friction before a 1-star review happens.

\+ How Settings screens help your ASO indirectly?  
  
 Fewer frustrated users  
 More control = more 5  
 Fewer uninstalls  
 Better support access = Healthier App Store presence.

TL;DR: Your Settings screen isn’t just a boring extra.  
  
It’s the user’s comfort zone.  
It’s your second chance to build trust.  
And it’s often the quiet key to retention.  
Design it with intention.

He went back to school for his last two weeks had coffee with another woman, kept snap chat and sexual photos with women on there.  He had two ""friends"" he was just talking to like friends from our small town since November.  A couple ""friends"" on snap since November.  I just found snaps saved nothing inappropriate but saved none the less from 2022.  He said he doesn't know why he saved them and there was nothing there. He thought she was pretty but that is it.  I asked again as I have been doing if there is anything else and he says his memory is not good and he only remembers when I find something and bring it up.  During his 8 week course there were 23 pages of women he had friended on snap.  He flirted on insta, and tictok as well, amongst porn.  Can this be reconconciled or is it too much?

There's a lot of clutter in the pic that isn't permanent, but eventually I am trying to go for a blend of eclectic, modern, and traditional.  Any advice is appreciated, but please be kind as it's a work in progress!!   


I'm stuck on what to do with the back wall and corners. I'd really like to have as much seating as possible for when we have guests.  


I just bought the couch, which is probably way too bulky for the space.... But we really wanted something big and comfy since we spend so much time there, so I sacrificed design for function. It is modular so I can rearrange it, but I kinda like how it currently separates the room from our kitchen area and I plan to add a console table at the back. I tried putting all the pieces in a row along the wall but it was super long and didn't look great. I also have the option of buying another section, but didn't necessarily want to add MORE bulk.  

Things that I plan to replace/ don't need to stay: 

* Coffee table 
* Kallax shelf 
* Cat tower 
* Ceiling light 
* Need to get curtains 
* Chair - We really love it and it's a recliner, but i don't really like the look of a green chair and a green couch. But I like how it brings in a bit of traditional style so I'm everything isn't too modern.

His idea was the next time anyone asked for it he would make them order it by this name but nobody ever asked for it again.

One of his old friends and regulars was this guy named Pompeo Stillo who saw that I'd bought records from a neighboring record store one day and said that he'd made one and would bring me a copy.

And it’s definitely not the time you posted “Rise & Grind 💪” with a blurry selfie at WeWork.



I used to think LinkedIn was just a fancier Facebook.

Slapped on a half-decent profile pic, called myself a “growth wizard” (yes, really), and thought people would just get what I do.



They didn’t.

Not a single DM. Not even a spammy one.



So I did what any confused millennial would do:

Spent $15,000 attending marketing events.

Sat through panels about “authenticity” delivered by people who sounded like AI-generated TED Talks.

Still confused.



Then I started actually posting.

Consistently. Imperfectly. Like a human.

And funny enough… things started clicking.



Here’s what I learned the hard (and now obvious) way:



1. Everyone needs positioning.

Whether you’re the CEO of a billion-dollar beast or you sell falafel wraps in Shoreditch.

If people don’t know who you’re for and why you’re different, they scroll. Simple.



2. Personal brand ≠ personal diary.

Yes, show your face. But also… show us your value.

No one hires you because you love hiking unless you’re building hiking websites.



3. Your profile is prime real estate.

→ Headline = outcome, not title.

→ Banner = context.

→ About = proof you’re not just winging it.

→ Featured = the goods (results, freebies, spicy content)



4. You don’t find your brand by overthinking.

You find it by doing.

Post. See what sticks. Tweak. Repeat.

That’s how you get clarity, not another Miro board session.



5. Tools help. But not if you’re just procrastinating.

I use Notion to organise my content ideas and keep my positioning tight.

It’s simple, clean, no fluff. Like a good espresso.

(Not sponsored. Yet.)



So yeah, you do need a brand.



Even if you're just testing the waters or freelancing on weekends.



Because the truth is: LinkedIn is your stage and your profile is either inviting people in, or pushing them off a cliff.



Your call.



Be honest: is your profile attracting clients or just confusing people?

No? Then check this stuff to master it ❯❯❯❯ [https://www.golumi.io/li-profits/ref/14/](https://www.golumi.io/li-profits/ref/14/)

I'm on a journey of figuring out if I have ADHD and have been for a while. This sub has always been great help to me so I hope this post is okay as someone who doesn't have a diagnosis 

Something I experience more often than I'd like to is this: whenever I have to focus on something that is difficult for me for a long time I get weird symptoms. The first time I experienced this was when I had to study for an exam for my job and it was the most boring, badly written book ever. Recently I've started playing d&d and its been happening there too. We'll have a session and after about 3-4 hours I start to get this weird feeling

- rubbing my forehead to try to ease discomfort
- not like focus headache, that feels more stabby
- heavy eyes from the feeling in my brain and head
- brain fog? Like a thick mist but my thoughts haven't slowed down
- feels similar to overstimulation in the sense that the situation feels overwhelming and I want to get out
- feels under stimulating at the same time though 
- I wouldn't call it pain but it's also rather uncomfortable. If it got worse I might try pain meds but usually it doesn't get worse. I will most likely get something stimulating like candy or coffee. Although as I'm writing this post with these symptoms it is starting to become painful
- usually gets better once I play loud music, do an activity that requires me to walk around and use my hands for 15+ minutes. Or tiktok scrolling lol
- hard time reading during and after, makes headache worse (even though with d&d i dont need to read usually!)
- fidgeting more
- easily frustrated 

Ive heard people say this might be ADHD. for years I used to think that this was normal, that other people dont have attention spans that last longer than an hour or so. But now that I play d&d with 3 different groups, and it keeps happening with all these different groups of people, I'm wondering if I'm the problem... do i have an attention span problem? Is this ADHD boredom? 

I'm trying to collect ""evidence"" for maybe having ADHD. I've been on the fence for about 2 years about trying to get a diagnosis. I'm scared that I don't have enough symptoms and that I will not be listened to. So if this could be ADHD it helps me prove to doctors it might be worth a shot to get me tested.. if not then I've also learned something about myself",3,1746905396.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

1kji7po,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kji7po/repair_the_marriage_or_leave_36f35m/,Repair the Marriage or Leave? (36F/35M),"TL;DR: Is our relationship worth it/possible to repair with 3 kids after exploring the lifestyle, an AP, separating, and discussing divorce?

I (36F) have been married to my husband (35M) for almost 6 years. We dated for about a year and a half before that. When we met, we were very aligned on wanting to get married, have kids, be a power couple, grow our wealth, etc. I'm a very pragmatic and generally type A person. My biological clock was ticking and I was primarily dating to find the father of my children, not necessarily my soulmate. So we moved very quickly into all of those goals.

In 2019, we got a dog, got engaged, got married, got a house, I got a new job, and got pregnant. We had our first child in 2020, another in 2021, and our third in 2023 (unplanned, I was on birth control). As our responsibilities grew as parents, I felt more and more disconnected from him with our already relatively weak emotional connection. He lacks attunement and avoids difficult conversations. I lack patience and avoid being vulnerable.

When we first met, I was in social circles with several individuals in either the Lifestyle or poly relationships. I'm very hypersexual and used to go to sex clubs/parties. We had originally discussed going down that avenue at some point, but like most men, he only wanted to add females to our dynamic, which we did on various occasions. But other fantasies I brought up and desired were either off the table (anal, MMF, group play, etc.) or we tried and went extremely poorly (roleplay, BDSM, etc.). Things as simple as wearing lingerie or using toys were things he didn't appreciate or enjoy. He's just a pretty simple and vanilla dude. When we got married, I thought certainly he would open up or be interested in these kinds of things as time went on, and he thought I would chill out. But neither of those things happened.

In addition to being sexually frustrated, I was the primary caretaker of the three toddlers/babies and primary breadwinner as he went through several periods of unemployment in those first 3 years of marriage. I also got promoted to being a corporate Manager about two years ago. Have always held the health insurance for the entire family, take the kids to Dr appts, etc.

I brought up my resentment over all of these things repeatedly and had open communication with him and finally set up weekly couples therapy for us. I had first brought up divorce around this time and he said he would never forgive me if I went through with it. Our first day of couples therapy just coincidentally happened to be the day I found out I was pregnant with baby #3. He was open minded at first, but I didn't really see many behaviors change or self reflection over the ~7/8 months we were in it together WEEKLY. He finally got a good job (and still has it) and then said he could no longer go to therapy because he wanted to be successful at his new job. I did understand, but was also pretty disappointed because I didn't feel we had really made any progress.

This is where, if I had been a better person, I would've made better choices. I have had a FetLife account for years and had been casually chatting with people with no real intention of meeting up. I started talking to someone framing himself as a ""Dom"". We got coffee, it turned into more. I compartmentalized and kept it strictly to a physical BDSM experience. (I realize now he was not a Dom, just someone preying on vulnerable women on the internet).

In that timeframe, my husband and I also stepped into the lifestyle, primarily as exhibitionists. At first, it was a lot of fun and reinvigorated our sex life. But the emotional connection was still lacking. Eventually we were at a LS takeover and ended up doing a same room swap, but he left after he had finished with the wife and felt uncomfortable seeing me with someone else. We talked about it a lot and moved to having hookups separately. I think part of all of this was me trying to make up for having stepped out in our relationship earlier without his knowledge. He had fun going on several dates, but had a much harder time finding interest. He had also put on some weight over the past few years and although well endowed downstairs, struggled much more than I did to find interest as a male. He also lost interest in hooking up with people and thought it was more work than it was worth.

I was pretty particular and only hooked up with two or three people. One of them I met in August of last year. It started as a fling and I even told him that I was 98% sure I wouldn't leave my husband when we started. But the more we talked and saw each other, the more we emotionally and physically connected. He speaks the same love languages as me, shares the same fantasies, and I have been able to be more vulnerable with him and receive the responses I had always hoped for with him. It has also been some of the best, most exploratory and fulfilling sex I've ever had. He is divorced with two toddlers himself and understands where I am at.

In October, I finally reached a breaking point after a work conference. My husband picked me up at the airport and had gotten the wrong baby formula (this may seem minor, but if you have kids, you know it's not) and I felt myself feeling depressed to be back ""home"" with him and my overwhelming life. I finally told him I wanted a divorce. He said repeatedly that he thought I would never leave. He did not handle things well, told the kids I was leaving because I didn't love him anymore, called both of our parents crying, etc.

I moved into an Airbnb for about a month as a trial separation period. I had the kids every other week. My (let's call it what it is) affair partner stayed with me on the weeks off. I got a glimpse into what life with him would be like. He doesn't know how to cook or clean, things I had taught my husband to do over the years. And I didn't really know how to feel about the idea of having my children have a step-father figure. I still felt a new sense of freedom and peace though operating life without my husband.

I couldn't stay at the Airbnb forever due to finances, so I moved back home, but still considered myself separated. My husband was still wearing his wedding ring and still does to this day. Things were weird. My husband and I barely talked, but kept a good facade up for the kids. We parent the kids together very well when we take our relationship out of it. I found myself falling into a deep depression, about what I'd done, feeling stuck in a life I didn't want, at least not with the person I had chosen.

I found myself having trouble getting out of bed, taking care of the kids, etc. My husband stepped up and started taking on the role of primary caretaker during this time (the last ~6 months), which I have appreciated. I continued seeing my AP when I could, sometimes staying overnight with him, but always coming back home before the kids were awake. It got to a point where I was suicidal because I felt so trapped, torn, and hopeless. We saw our therapist a handful of times over these months. She told us that she has only ever told two other couples in her 20 years of work that they should separate and we were the third. He argued with her and disagreed. She is divorced and he said taking marriage advice from her is like taking diet advice from an obese nutritionist.

I needed a plan to leave to feel better about the future and get myself out of depression, so I finally met with a lawyer. When I discussed with my husband, he told me over and over that he doesn't want me to leave, doesn't care that I had an affair, wants to repair things and move on together as a family unit. He feels very strongly that should be the highest priority. He is more upset about losing his time with the kids than losing me. When I was suicidal, he told me that I don't just get to say I'm suicidal and get whatever I want (divorce). He also will not allow me to take any part of our savings to buy a new place or move out, so I would have to wait until the divorce is final to get any results. He also will not agree to any custody schedule I present to him. He said he will make divorce as hard as possible and fight for as much custody as he can get and hire an expensive lawyer to burn through our savings. I was hoping we could work through the separation amicably, realizing that we just are not compatible in so many ways and the trust is gone. But he made it clear that isn't an option. I was open to trying to file ourselves, working through things together, saving money, etc.

He isn't a bad person, at least not in the same way that I am. He is not physically abusive and he is generally a good father. I would also ideally like to stay married, continue growing our assets together, but be able to find emotional and physical connection outside of the marriage. I tried to end things with my AP about a week ago to work on healing the marriage. But neither of us can leave the other alone. I did at least explain that it is unlikely I'll be able to leave this marriage anytime soon. I do find some times that are nice at home with my husband and our kids. I get a peaceful feeling knowing they are the priority. 

I've started saving money on the side, just in case, but it isn't anywhere close enough to put a down payment on a property and I'd like to avoid renting. Once again, I can't really move out unless my husband would agree to a custody agreement anyway. I don't know what to do. I'm feeling trapped, unhappy, and lost. I got myself here through a variety of bad decisions. I probably should've never married my husband, taken it slower having kids, not breaking the trust within the marriage bond, etc.

My husband strongly believes he has done nothing to warrant a divorce. Maybe he is right, I feel gaslit into staying with him sometimes. He talks about the future, creating a happy life for the kids, having each other when our parents die. But we have had arguments on almost every vacation we've been on together and usually fight at holidays. I have a hard time imagining myself staying with him after the kids are out of the house. I want a relationship where I can look forward to my time off work, which has been extremely stressful on top of all of this going on in my personal life.

But I guess my hesitation is that it seems like my husband loves me unconditionally...? I know romance and passion fade. Is this what marriage is about? Working through hard things and times together? Also, trying to cause the least amount of damage for our three little ones. I have no idea if it is even worth trying to repair at this point.

I just needed to get this entire situation off my chest and see what the good old internet thinks. I'm sure the Reddit warriors will come at me for cheating. But even just rereading this, I know it's all just a fucking mess.",1,1746905255.0,relationship_advice,4,0.67,False

I work at my family's restaurant, and I’m beyond exhausted not just physically, but mentally and emotionally. I come in 30 minutes early every single day to clean the tables, wipe down the coffee machine, prep the dishwasher everything. Meanwhile, my cousin strolls in 30 minutes late every shift, and no one says a word. In fact, he gets paid more than me because he supposedly “works harder.” The disrespect is unbelievable.

I do the majority of the work during every shift: I take most of the orders, I’m constantly interacting with customers with a smile, I clean the tables no one wants to touch, and I even fill the drinks which shouldn’t even be my job. We have a system in place: the person who takes the order is supposed to be backed up by the others, who handle drinks and sides so things move fast and smooth. But no one else follows that system except me. I always follow it. And when others slack, I still pick up the slack. Always.

Today just made everything worse. We had a new girl come in to try out for a server job. She didn’t move when customers came in, didn’t react when the bell rang for food, and straight-up ignored me when I told her to do anything. She sat there twirling her hair, being “shy,” and flirting with one of our other servers like this was a dating show. She didn’t lift a single finger and somehow, my uncle said she did amazing. When I said otherwise, they told me I was just jealous.

I’m not jealous I’m devastated. I give everything to this job. I sacrifice my time, my energy, and my peace of mind to make sure this place runs. And all I get in return is criticism, disrespect, and being treated like I’m ungrateful if I even hint that I want to work somewhere else. When I say I’m thinking about leaving, they act like I’m betraying them, like I’m selfish—when I’ve done nothing but give and give and give.

They never say thank you. They don’t notice when I’m the one making everything work. But the second I stop smiling or show the tiniest sign of exhaustion, suddenly I’m “doing the bare minimum.” I feel so hurt. So invisible. I’m not a machine. I’m not a slave. I’m not some ungrateful brat. I’m the one person actually keeping this business alive, and they don’t even see it.

If they don’t care enough to treat me with respect, maybe they deserve to find out what it’s like without me there. I’m tired of being the only one who shows up, follows the rules, cares about the customers, and keeps the system alive while everyone else floats.

Let me tell you what happens if you take a Software Testing Shortcut…

>

I get this question a lot. It sounds reasonable, right?

Who has time for anything these days? But here’s what’s actually happening when you ask this question: you’re about to make the same mistake most professionals make when they try to shortcut their learning.

Let me tell you a story.

Last month, Ivana, a QA engineer at a mid-sized tech company, came to me. She’d taken three different “quick” testing courses over the past year. Each promised to teach her everything in 2-3 hours. She spent 6 hours total, plus another 10 hours trying to piece together what she’d learned, and she was still struggling. When her team adopted Scrum, she felt totally lost.

That’s when I showed her what v2 actually covers: test automation frameworks that work in real Scrum environments, security testing that prevents breaches before they happen, parallel testing workflows that make you an asset instead of a bottleneck, and the “80/20 Testing Method” that catches critical bugs even under insane deadlines. Plus full modules on how testing fits into each sprint phase, how to handle vague requirements that change mid-sprint, and automation techniques that don’t require coding experience.

When she saw the curriculum—everything from unit testing basics to advanced performance testing strategies—she realized something: “Wait, this is the knowledge people usually take years to pick up on the job, compressed into 11 hours?”

The course isn’t live yet (launches in 15 days), but after walking through the structure, she’s confident she’ll have the skills to lead testing strategy meetings and implement automation that saves her team 40+ hours a week. Her exact words: “Finally, something that covers what I actually need to know, not just theory I’ll never use.”

Here’s what actually happens when you try to learn complex skills quickly:

# The Quick Course Illusion (Software Testing Shortcut)

Short courses give you vocabulary, not skills. You’ll learn what “regression testing” means. You won’t learn how to actually set up regression tests that catch real bugs without taking forever to run.

You’ll hear about “test automation.” You won’t learn why your automation keeps failing or how to build tests that actually work in a CI/CD pipeline.

It’s like learning to drive by memorizing traffic rules. Sure, you know what a stop sign means. But can you parallel park on a busy street?

# The Math Nobody Talks About

Let’s be honest about what “saving time” really costs:

Quick course: 2 hours + 4 hours of confusion + 6 hours of Googling + 15 hours of trial and error at work + the cost of things you missed = About 27 hours, plus the stress of constantly feeling behind, and not to mention the nagging doubt that you’re missing something important.

Comprehensive course: 11 hours of structured (curated) learning + sharing your thoughts + homework assignments + quizzes = immediate application at work, and you actually know what you’re doing.

I’ve seen this play out dozens of times. The “time-saving” approach ends up costing more time, money, and career opportunities.

# What “Comprehensive” Actually Gives You?

When I say comprehensive, I don’t mean we pad the course with filler. Here’s what those extra hours buy you:

Context, not just content. ([**WATCH THE VIDEO**](https://youtu.be/90A1fui8sno?si=iFuA3sK8-Ja_D5a3)) You don’t just learn test cases. You learn when to write them, when to automate them, and when to skip them entirely. This is the stuff that separates junior testers from senior ones.

Troubleshooting skills. When your automation breaks at 3 AM (and it will), you need to know how to fix it. Quick courses don’t teach debugging. They assume everything works perfectly.

Real-world application. You practice on actual Scrum scenarios. You learn how to handle stakeholder pushback. You figure out what to do when requirements change mid-sprint.

# The Career Impact Nobody Mentions

Here’s something important: your resume doesn’t list how quickly you learned something. It lists what you can do.

“Completed 10-hour testing mastery course” means nothing to hiring managers.

“Implemented automated testing framework that reduced regression testing time by 70%” gets you the job.

The comprehensive course gives you the second one.

The quick course gives you the first.

# Making It Work for Your Life

Look, I know you’re busy. Everyone is. But here’s how real people actually complete comprehensive courses:

They watch one 15-minute lesson during their morning coffee. They do the practice exercises over lunch. They apply what they learned at work immediately.

Most students finish in 4-6 weeks while working full-time. Some take longer. Some go faster. The point isn’t speed. The point is actually learning the skills.

# The Question You Should Be Asking

Instead of “How can I learn this faster?” ask “How can I make sure this actually sticks?”

Instead of “What’s the minimum I need to know?” ask “What will make me genuinely useful to my team?”

Those questions lead to different choices. Better choices.

# The Real Choice

You can spend 2 hours getting comfortable with testing vocabulary. That’s fine if you just need to participate in meetings.

Or you can spend 12 hours becoming someone your team actually relies on for testing expertise. Someone who prevents bugs instead of just finding them.

Someone who automates the boring stuff and focuses on the interesting problems.

This isn’t about perfectionism. It’s about being honest with yourself about what you actually want from your career.

# Why This One?

[**Software Testing Mastery**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/) v2 isn’t longer because we like wasting your time. It’s longer because:

* Testing has evolved in the past 3 years (yes, that quickly)
* We included what our v1 students said they wished they’d known
* We added the real-world frameworks that actually work
* We built in practice time because theory alone doesn’t cut it

Here’s the thing: v1 doesn’t exist anymore, but over 4,500 students loved it. Their feedback is exactly what I used to build v2. When students kept saying “I wish this covered X” or “I needed help with Y,” I listened. That’s why v2 is longer—it’s not just updated, it’s built on what thousands of real testers said they actually needed in the real world.

Plus, you can take as long as you need. The content is there when you’re ready for it. Compare that to a workshop where you have to absorb everything in one sitting.

# The Bottom Line

The fastest way to learn something is not the shortest way. It’s the way that actually sticks.

Quick courses turn you into someone who “knows about” testing. Comprehensive courses turn you into someone who can actually test software in complex, real-world environments.

Your choice.

*P.S. Still not convinced? Ask yourself this: What’s been the cost of the skills you never truly mastered? The opportunities missed? The extra hours spent figuring things out? Yeah. Thought so.*

1kji21w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kji21w/should_you_buy_the_amazon_basics_cm9409tul/,Should You Buy the Amazon Basics CM9409T-UL Coffeemaker Review Before Your Next Morning Brew?,"The Amazon Basics CM9409T-UL Programmable Coffeemaker has been sitting on my countertop for well over two weeks, and I feel like I’ve brewed enough coffee to power a small town. Testing this 12-cup drip machine with its stylish stainless-steel design was not just convenient but a bit of a morning ritual now. For someone picky about both the brewing process and the final taste, this programmable coffee machine proved to be a dependable daily partner, though not without its quirks.

**Sleek Yet Functional Design**  
Right out of the box, the Amazon Basics CM9409T-UL impresses with its modern, minimalist stainless-steel finish and compact design. At 6.77"" D x 10.96"" W x 14.53"" H, it fits snugly in my modestly sized kitchen without causing too much clutter. I liked how its clean black accents make the coffeemaker look more upscale than its price might suggest. The reusable filter is both eco-friendly and cost-effective, eliminating the need to rush out for paper filters at inconvenient times. However, the plastic components, while lightweight, do lack a certain premium touch that you might find in higher-end machines.

**Programmable Features for Coffee on Demand**  
Since my mornings are anything but organized, the programmable function came in handy. Using the intuitive buttons on this machine, I set the timer before bed, and by the time I stumbled into the kitchen, a steaming pot of coffee awaited. The digital clock is easy to read, and the buttons are straightforward to operate. I tested this feature multiple times, and it worked like a charm except for one morning where I realized I hadn't closed the filter basket properly. That’s a lesson in user error, not a fault of the product, in fairness.

**Highlights**  
- Programmable brewing for convenient morning coffee prep.  
- Reusable filter basket, eliminating paper filter waste.  
- Stainless steel housing for durability and style.  

[Check Amazon Basics CM9409T-UL price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b084zgmx1k/)  

**Performance and Brewing Consistency**  
This drip coffee maker promises a capacity for 12 cups, and although I rarely brew that much, it’s impressive when hosting guests. I tried both finer and coarser grind settings with varying coffee brands to test its versatility. The results were consistent, offering a rich, smooth taste on most occasions. However, the product does note that grind size and amount can affect the brew pressure and taste. I did notice a minor issue: if the grind was too fine or overfilled, coffee residue occasionally leaked past the filter, leaving a bit of grit in the bottom of my cup.

**Negatives to Consider**  
- Occasional grit in the coffee with finer grinds.  
- Plastic components feel less durable.  

**Ease of Cleaning**  
I absolutely loved the cleaning process. The reusable filter and carafe are easy to remove and rinse, which probably saved me hours compared to my older machine that required scrubbing. Plus, the warming plate did its job keeping coffee warm, but cleaning off coffee dribbles post-pour took some patience. 

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing this programmable coffee maker against similar mid-range brands, the standout feature here is undoubtedly its affordability. Competing machines like the BLACK+DECKER 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker offer similar functionality but often lack reusable filters or a modern stainless-steel finish. On the flip side, higher-end models from Breville or Cuisinart deliver more brewing options and precise temperature control, which this machine misses out on entirely. However, for those not obsessing over the intricacies of barista-level brewing, this Amazon Basics model provides excellent value.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
For the price, this coffeemaker feels like a steal. It offers key features—programmable brewing, reusable filters, and a substantial 12-cup capacity—that are normally found in pricier models. While you won’t get advanced temperature customization or barista trims, it’s clear this machine prioritizes function over flair. In my opinion, it’s perfect for anyone looking for affordable, reliable coffee brewing without unnecessary frills.

Amid the leaden rain, seven toungs of flame did shine o'er the lines of steel. By each shining blade a prayer was said that to Ireland her sons be true. When the morning broke, still the war flag shook out its folds in the Foggy Dew.""* 

*-Excerpt from ""The Foggy Dew""-*

Footsteps echoed down the roads of Islay, echoing through the mist and the darkness.

They came from Bowmore, Port Charlotte and Ballygrant. Men and women gathering in cause, leaving children with their grandparents, a kiss to their mothers and fathers with a promise they could never hope to keep. They came from Ardnave, Ardbeg and Portnahaven bearing relics of war that had most recently been used for hunting and ammunition that was dubious at best. Sons and daughters of ancient Celtic families that had fled to Arran to preserve their heritage, drawn by the fire in their hearts, a burning anger at the bodies of suspected insurgents left to rot in the streets of Port Ellen. 

The Dexians had hoped to douse a rumor, to put to rest the notion that the Gallóglaigh had resumed fighting across Brodick. Nobody really knew where the rumor came from, conjecture being the most likely source, but the response was swift as a storm rolling in off the sea. Twenty-four young men who had been under surveillance were torn from their homes and jobs, marched out into the center of Port Ellen, accused and convicted of espionage against the Dexians, and gunned down in front of their families and friends. 

What they had assumed would dround out any hope for rebellion only fanned the coals to reignite, hotter than ever before. 

They came from Sheppard's homes and little farms, their shoes caked with mud and wet grass. They came from distilleries and pubs, coats still wet with spilled whiskey from rage fueled drinking. They came from shops and fishing boats, little inns where the lights were left on in the hope that they would find their way home. They came from every corner of the island, deafening footfalls echoed in every ear, feeding the terror growing in the mind of every Dexian in garrison at Port Ellen.

 Retribution marched across the blood soaked stones as the bodies were retrieved and spirited away to burial in unmarked graves. A roaring wind of vengeful voices demanding compensation for the innocent lives denied their peaceful end. Panicing yellow eyes and twitching blue lips met the mob bearing weapons in trembling hands slick with sweat and exposure to the moist sea air. 

A single mistake, a moment of uncertainty and panic, maybe just the moisture of the misty night causing a finger to slip or an unintended muscle spasm that squeezed the trigger. The authoritative bark of the fired weapon and they dying scream of a human. A moment of unblemished silence for those who had perished in the day and those about to die this night as well.

///// 

It was too much for Major Stone and his small intelligence gathering force to ignore. Perched on the fourth floor of a small apartment building they had paid witness to the mock trial and overly excessive execution. Now they watched as thousands of people crowded in the streets with no cover or concealment, easy pickings for a well regimented and appropriately armed military force. If they followed their orders, they would be captured sometime later in the night when the Dexians started clearing buildings. If they disobeyed...

With the dying scream of some unfortunate soul in the street below their path was laid bare before them. No words needed be spoken, no action needed be laid out and approved, every man that could went to a window and embodied the vengeful spirit of wrath, merciless angels of War defending the lives of the innocent from on high. No more the stoic and silent soldiers on an espionage mission, tears of anger streaked every cheek as obscenities were screamed to whatever vindictive gods would answer their blasphemous prayers. Bullets and coherent light tore through the dexian flank like a dull Scythe being passed through stalks of rye, leaving tattered and torn corpses in its wake. 

Initially stunned by the death in their midst, the civilians were quick to capitalize on the distracted Dexians, overrunning their previously well established lines. Those with rifles let loose with the pinpoint accuracy achieved by hunting rabbits in their fields back home for generations. Those not armed with rifles or pistols opted for loose pipes and boards, even rocks and bricks pried from nearby walls. Those same streets that had flowed red with the blood of the innocent in the warm afternoon sun now raged in the darkness and gloom with the blood of the damned. 

As the guns fell silent and the cries of the dying faded toward the dawn, a song rang out clear, voices previously filled with rage now filled with something else, a mixture of sadness and pride that carried the longing of every heart assembled. Major Stone and his mean only understood bits and pieces of the song, but it's meaning remained crystal clear as the local star began its ascent into the sky. 

""Sé mo laoch mo ghile mear. Sé mo shéasar, ghile mear. Suan gan séan, ní bhfuair mé fién, Ó chuaigh I gcéin mo ghile mear.""

/////

Major Stone handed the report to Laird MacSweeney, his blood-shot eyes betraying the sleepless night. The sodden uniform hung limp from his haggard shoulders. His return from Islay through fog and rough seas was mentioned in the report as little more than a footnote against the mock trial and execution of twenty-four young men, the white hot anger that spilled out into the streets of Port Ellen in response, his men's disobedience to orders, and the revelation that the Gallóglaigh were not just on Brodick as the Dexians had initially assumed. 

With a heavy sigh, Laird MacSweeney flopped in his chair and tossed the pages of the report in the air. 

""What's done is done."" 

""Laird,"" Major Stone croaked past dry lips, ""I take full responsibility for the mission and its failure."" 

""Failure?"" Laird MacSweeney scoffed. ""You could no more control or take responsibility for what transpired than I or Robert could have predicted it would happen."" 

""We acted against orders...""

""And saved countless lives in the process."" Laird MacSweeney interrupted. ""If there is any blame to be had it does not rest on your shoulders Major."" 

Major Stone collapsed into a chair as if the burden of command was the only thing holding him up, and relived of that had nothing else to support him. He closed his eyes for a moment, taking in one sweet sip of the rest his body and soul demanded, but refusing to indulge further. 

""No Major, you and your men are to be commended for their actions. The Garrison that blocked our access to Kilnaughton Bay has been annihilated, the people of Islay have tasted liberty restored, and we have no more time to spend on what could be or might have been."" 

Laird MacSweeney picked himself up from his chair and grabbed a pen and paper. 

""You and your men should rest for a day, maybe two or three based on your own appearance."" 

""A couple hours of sleep and a hot cup of coffee will suffice."" 

""I sincerely doubt that."" Laird MacSweeney replied returning to his seat. ""You should remain on Jura for the time being, to defend this island from what is coming."" 

Major Stone felt the hair on the back of his neck rising. 

""You mean ""*WE*"" I assume?"" 

Laird MacSweeney didn't answer right away, busy with writing a few words, considering the message and nodding in approval. 

""The time for cloaks and daggers is at an end Major, I will take the Ceithearn to Port Ellen and head to Bowmore from there.""

Folding the message, Laird MacSweeney dripped blue wax on the edges and pressed his signet it seal the document. 

""Give this to Sorcha when she returns. Make sure she knows to deliver it directly to Colonel Grant and no one else."" 

Major Stone looked at the seal of Clan MacSweeney pressed into the wax. The Laird was clearly done hiding and snooping from a distance. 

""May I inquire as to what it says?"" 

Laird MacSweeney smiled, much like he had before the invasion. A familiar glint in his eyes as if the last several months had vanished like a bad dream. The authority of his name and his governorship of his home was reflected in his face as he spoke the three words that called his people to war.

Blue Bottle No 1 first released October 2023 $20/sleeve 🇺🇸
Blue Bottle Gitega Hills April 2024 Release $22/sleeve 🇺🇸
No 1 came back in Fall 2024 🇺🇸

Nespresso has released it in other countries as well but I haven’t followed those dates.

This next release is supposedly a collaboration with The Weeknd and is Blue Bottle's version of NoLa chicory coffee. This is not The Weeknd's first collaboration with Blue Bottle coffee. Previously they did a collaboration with a charitable component. 

Pure Speculation (complete guess based on past information): 
I do not know if this will be US only. I can't find a clear connection between The Weeknd or NoLA whereas he heavily referenced his connection to Ethiopia during interviews on the last collab with Blue Bottle. Since he is from Toronto and Blue Bottle is supposed to be in Canada soon, possibly this is the release for Canada as well. This is all a COMPLETE guess! I've heard it was supposed to be Blue Bottle No 1 in Canada so who knows🤷‍♀️

We do know that the US should get it June 10th (could change!!) as the NoLa version. If you want to try it the way Blue Bottle serves it (obviously not Nespresso pod format), it is at a lot of Whole Foods (with milk and sugar added).

I’m rated and in constant therapy but to live on this super alert panic mode 24/7 is something that nobody takes serious either if they have their own beliefs about mental health or insecurity or even if they knew you prior to having it, nobody seems to really care or be willing to deal with it. I mean obviously it’s a lot for people but they realize you’re a person struggling and I can’t tell if people don’t care or enjoy seeing you suffer. In my experience I’ve dealt with every possibility. You know most of the legwork I had to do to fight for myself and nobody helped me. Then you get soembting like a rating and if you come from a competitive family or friend group they view you as lazy or getting a ""handout"". Like hold on a minute. The scenarios running through your head when you’re dealing with PTSD and being super alert maybe they don’t realize what it actually is. I mean it completely changes you from the inside the way you operate and the way you conduct yourself. For example if your boss lets says violated you while you were sleeping and then you make a report after and instead of receiving help and care they instead shift blame to you and keep you under a extremely stressful situation for a extended period of time by means of retaliation threats intimidation and maybe even using smear campaigns against you and different methods to discredit you would you be the same after? Would you be okay and just move on if your ex wife lives with the person who did this to you and they are seemingly working together in a way to undermine you. Even after you leave that work environment. Let’s put into perspective the idea of a honey pot someone placed into your life at the right time to further destabilize your life while your in the middle of that situation and then blame accuse and try to discredit you all while you know she actually is best friends with that bosses wife too. I’m just trying to point a picture for someone maybe you didn’t have a chance to serve in combat so now you feel emasculated and humiliated and on top of that when people ask your veteran status you get side eyes and odd looks from people. Didn’t a lady sue McDonald’s for 5 million dollars for a cup of hot coffee? Everybody applauds her for that obviously jealous but nobody questions her I bet. I mean what are we talking about here. I just want an idea if anybody has experienced anything similar.  People tend to think because they know you or something that that makes them less likely to care about your circumstances I mean getting more empathy from strangers will always be something I don’t understand maybe it’s because being in your twenties people just have to find a reason to tear you down but what’s peoples opinions.

1kjhr6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kjhr6l/uschina_tariff_talks_to_continue_sunday/,US-China tariff talks to continue Sunday,"GENEVA (AP) — Sensitive talks between U.S. and Chinese delegations over tariffs that threaten to upend the global economy ended after a day of prolonged negotiations and will resume Sunday, an official told The Associated Press.

There was no immediate indication whether progress was made Saturday during the meeting over 10 hours between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng.

The official who spoke to the AP requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff. The talks have been shrouded in secrecy and neither side made comments to reporters on the way out.

Several convoys of black vehicles left the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, which hosted the talks aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks took place.

The talks were taking place in the sumptuous 18th-century “Villa Saladin” overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government.

Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes — tariffs — they’ve slapped on each other’s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.

U.S. President Donald Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China [to a combined 145%](https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-trade-taxes-trump-china-bessent-treasury-66668fa26957ece530a250fa8ea19faa), and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries’ boycotting each other’s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.

Even before the talks began, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that “ [80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-china-41d189bfe510e3ed7692da8647a14e64).″

Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.

“The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,” she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. “It cannot just be words.”

Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as [his favorite economic weapon](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-china-41d189bfe510e3ed7692da8647a14e64). He has, for example, [imposed a 10% tax on imports](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-stock-market-china-recession-deals-e8e54a68397e6829e1d27552a1d7bfb9) from almost every country in the world.

But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump’s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.

During Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.

Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues — such as China’s subsidies — were left for future negotiations.

But China didn’t come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.

The fight over China's tech policy now resumes.

Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.

In Switzerland Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.

Trump last month [suspended plans](https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-kellersutter-bessent-trump-tariffs-3b60eb27bf53b6b3a815e7a43169badc) to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods — more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but could raise them again.

The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.

“An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland’s interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,” the government said last week, adding that the executive branch “is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.”

The government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another 21% beginning Wednesday.

The United States is Switzerland’s second-biggest trading partner after the EU – the 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.

The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.

Once i got there i went to an outdoor gym, a coffee shop, a restaurant, an ice cream shop and 5 shops. This was the first time doing that in a country where it isn’t deemed socially acceptable to walk barefoot but i decided to not put my sandals back on the entire day. 

I had 0 issues shopping/sitting in any of these places, no one questioned it or cared. Walking on the beachfront path past restaurants and by the main road i did get a few looks for a couple of seconds and in one of the shops one guy even said to his mrs in a confused tone “He’s walking on THAT?!?” which i found funny, but no one seemed to care or be negative about it.

Going barefoot whenever i can the last few years iv'e learned to care less and less by doing something out of the social norm and now i feel very carefree about other peoples judgment about anything in life. If you're new to going unshod or thinking about doing it but are nervous, do it i promise it will be worth it in the end!",16,1746903570.0,barefoot,0,1.0,False

Hello, as an introduction I have transcribed an Instagram reel below to sums up how I feel.

""Sorry if I love you too much or seem too obsessed. I'm just trying to give you the love I never got.  If I come on too strong or seem overwhelming,  it's not because I want to suffocate you. It's because I want to make sure you know how special you are to me. I don't want to repeat the mistakes I experienced, and sometimes I struggle to find balance. I just want to give you everything I wish I had. I love that's unconditional, strong, and always present. So if I ever seem too much, it's only because I'm trying to fill the voids in both our hearts with something real. I hope you can understand. I know I may not be perfect, but my heart is genuine,and all I want is to make you feel cherished in ways I never knew. If I come on strong, it's because I believe you deserve the kind of love that goes beyond limits"".

""Never break up when you start losing feelings because that's when real love starts. You can't just give up on someone because the situation is not ideal. Great relationships are not great because they have no problems. They're great because both people care enough about the other person to find a way to make it work. So when you're in a serious relationship, you'll have your ups and downs. But talking things over is a better solution than throwing it all away. Because the couples that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart and come out even stronger"".



About me

- Height: 6'0

- Alcohol: Very rarely as in once in a few months and I have never gotten drunk as the moment I feel dizzy, I counteract the effects with apple juice.

- Hair colour: Black

- Skin colour: naturally tanned skin

- Most people describe me as cute

- Always clean shaven

- I have no siblings 

- No tattoos or piercings

- Weight: varies between 70kg (150lb) to 75kg (165lb) depending on how much I eat and active I am. 

- Work out and eat healthy although from time to time, indulge myself with a pie, ice cream ot donut. 

- Finances: I manually keep track of my finances as I enjoy using cash wherever it is accepted. I like to physically feel money.

- Child-free life: never had an interest in having kids. I still remember my age when I made this life long decision, I was 17 at the time.

- Independence: I live alone in a foreign country (this is the second coubtry I am working temporarily with no family. Over the years I have learned to cry alone as I had no one to call and had to force myself to recover from severe depression. Including one very painful break up. I have also learned to take care of myself when I had accidents.

- Anger: I cannot get angry. If I do, I suffer with a headache and overtime my body has learned to associate anger with pain, so instead of gettin[?p0g angry, I get frustrated. To cope with my frustration, I go for a walk, look at the stars or something in the distant like a mountain, cityscape or the Ocean. Taking deep breaths also helps.

When I love someone, I put my partner first where I work out and try to be the best version of myself for my partner. This also goes for the way I dress to everything. 

Exploration of new interest: I take an interest in my partners hobbies, movies, music, food and  what she likes in order to deepen the connection and bond. 

Strong desire to be honest: when I am with a partner I have a strong desire to be transparent and I just feel comfortable being able to speak without thinking twice. 

Social isolation: I only feel a real social connection with a partner. I often feel lonely or withdrawn in social activities as I know that a partner is for life while other people are only their for the moment.

Panic mode: if my partner gets mad at me and starts scolding me I go into a panic mode where I become nervous, scared and my breathing becomes heavy. 

This is because my self-worth and validation becomes dependent on my partner and I am afraid to dissapoint her.


What do I expect from a partner?

Someone who cares in the sense will give me a hug or hold my hand when I need it the most and will be honest with me.

A partner who wants to create memories together, it could be something simple as watching the sunset and just eating a mal together.

I am mentally unable to feel attracted to more than one person due to Limerence which makes me extremely loyal and committed to one person.

Just knowing that I am special to my partner is enough to make happy.



Love Language: The way I express love towards a partner is through;

- Quality time where I give my partner her undivided attention, making memories together, shared activities and doing things together.

Acts of service: I believe that actions speak lounder than words and I have always dreamed of being the one who;
- does all the house chores so that you can relax
- cooking for you
- running an errand
- being helpful in anyway I can
- hold an umbrella over your head
- carry your bag
- serve you tea, juice coffee or anything you ask


Physical touch: Never experienced this. 
- Hug: Never been hugged by a women, but I long for it so much and would love to have a partner I can hug back.
- Kiss: I have kissed one person I love once loved on the cheek but never gotten a kiss back.
- Holding hands: never held hands, but want to
- Cuddling: Never experienced it, but I guess it must be nice.

Words of Affirmation: expressing affection through spoken or written words, such as compliments, encouragement, and expressions of love (""I love you"").

Photography: Photography is the best way to create a memory I would love to take photographs together and put them in physical photo album. 

Why am I still single? I have something called Limerence which is an obsessive romantic attraction to another person, which only happens if I genuinely 

Past relationships: One and it was a very toxic relationship where I was treated more like a Dog than a partner which ended in May, 2024. Due to Limerence which I didn't know I had at the time, I was unable to just break away from the toxic relationship. 


Things that I don't care about in a partner;

- Hair Color 
- Attitude 
- Career
- Height 
- Tattoos or birth marks you have
- Piercings 
- Race
- Religion 
- Your past
- Cooking: I can cook for you if you don't know how how to cook.
- Alcohol: get drunk if you want to, but if you start acting crazy I will just take you home.


Preferred Partner 

Skin colour: White or Tan

Age range: 24 to 34 

Someone who cares about her long term health. I mean as the saying goes ""health is wealth"".

Values Loyalty and will be transparent and honest with me just as I will be honest and transparent with you.

No smoking or Vaping. I hate the smell of nicotine and the the smoke released from exhaling vapes. Also, I saw my Grandpa suffer in hospital and die as result of a lifetime of smoking.

My interest 

- 35mm Film Photography: Imagine processing film together. 

- Analogue Navigation: Yes, even in 2025 I use a Lensatic compass and map for navigation outside the city, where often times, this ancient technology had proven itself to be more reliable and accurate compared to Google maps.  Believe me, if you get lost in a forest, desert or in the Ocean I am the guy you need by your side.

- Journaling: Lamy Safari,  Parker Jotter or Stencil Pencil 

- Typewriter: I own a Typewriter in my home country and love typing notes or documents on it. It is especially useful for typing out shopping list. 

- Old off-road vehicles: I prefer older vehicles from the 1970's and 80's due to the durability, reliability and such as the Toyota Hilux, Toyota Land Cruiser or a 1970's Land Rover Defender. Personally, due to my job I travel in Bentley, BMW's, Cadillac's, Lamborghini's, Nissan's, Toyota's, Mercedes. 

Watching birds and other animals through my binoculars or photographing them using my 200-500mm lens.


Send me a message and lets get to know each other better.  

Also, it would be lovely if we could call each other, as I feel it's easier to build a stronger connection.

The first four chapters are up, with more coming out weeklu/fortnightly depending how busy I am. Each chapter is over 2,000 words each, so enjoy! Make sure to comment your thoughts!

Summary:  
Between university lectures, late-night study sessions, and shifts at her favourite local bakery, Annabeth Chase barely has time to breathe—let alone think about love. But when she meets Percy, the temporary new hire covering for a sick coworker, her carefully structured world starts to shift. What she doesn't know is that Percy Jackson isn’t just any charming, flour-dusted stranger—he’s a globally famous musician, hiding out in plain sight.

Their connection is easy, magnetic, and completely unexpected. As their paths continue to cross over coffee, pastries, and quiet moments between the noise, Annabeth starts to realise there’s more to Percy than he lets on. Behind every song he’s written lies a memory, stitched together with stories he’s never told—until now. But some memories are harder to share than others, and not all of them are sweet. As old stories resurface and new ones begin, Annabeth finds herself caught in the space between the past and what could be.

**Pan-romantic Ace and proud!** Emotional connection is my love language—physical stuff is strictly DLC, not base game. Ask me anything!

**Forever DM & LARPer**—If your ideal date involves:

- Rolling nat 20s on flirting checks.
- Debating whether ""Lawful Neutral"" is code for ""boring.""
- Overnight LARP events where we pretend we’re not freezing in a tent.
- Crying over fictional characters like it’s our job.…then congratulations, we’re already fanfic OTP material.

**Writer & Professional Story Goblin**—I hoard tropes, re-tellings, and character arcs like a dragon with a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Romance? Love is Blind scenarios? Fresh spins on classic tales? YES. (Bonus if you want to rant about them with me after.)

**Magic: The Gathering Commander Player**—I enjoy:

- Politicking my way to victory.
- ""Friendly"" games that last 4+ hours.
- Arguing whether counterspells are evil (they’re not; cry about it).

**Media Snob with a Heart of Gold**—I’ll tear apart a lazy comic adaptation with citations, but I’ll also cry at a well-done romance subplot. Fight me (or join me; your call).

**Trans Woman**—Proud, open, and living my best life. If that’s an issue, exit stage left before I cast ""Power Word: Cringe"" on you.

**No Casual Mentality**—I’m here for the epic romance arc, not a filler episode.

**Adventure or Bust**—I need someone who actually leaves the house. Yes, cozy nights are great, but if your idea of excitement is only marathon shows, we might not vibe. Road trips, Ren Faires, hiking, spontaneous day trips, or even just exploring weird little towns? Let’s go.

- Officially dubbed **""The Most Adorable Human""** (*Source: My mirror. My cat. Peer-reviewed.*)
- **Empathetic listener + hype woman**—I’ll remember your niche hyper fixations and send you memes so specific, you’ll question reality.
- Matching Ren Faire/cosplay outfits? Done. Themed date nights? Obviously. Reading fanfic aloud dramatically? Already warming up my voice
- I will learn your ""useless"" fun facts and weaponize them later to make you smile.
- **My love language is physical touch**—translation: I cuddle like it’s my divine purpose.

# **Deal-Breakers (AKA ""Don’t Waste My Time""):**

- **Smoking/vaping or excessive drinking.**
- **Long-distance** outside driving range of **Northern Ohio** (*I’m flexible, but if flying is your only option, hard pass*).
- **Skipping the safety video call** within the first month (*non-negotiable; Not falling for that again!*).
- **Homebodies who never want to explore**—I need a partner-in-crime for actual adventures, not just couch quests.
- **Throwaway accounts**—If your account is less than 3 months old with nothing on it, do not message me. *It basically screams, red flag to me*

# **You Might Be My NPC (Noteworthy Partner Candidate) If You:**

- Believe in ""us against the world"" energy.
- Geek out over D&D backstories, RPG character creators, or Commander deck tech.
- Want someone who’ll bring you tea and listen to your latest 3 AM hyper fixation rant.
- Appreciate **ace-spectrum identities** and emotional intimacy.
- **Love spontaneous adventures**—whether it’s a midnight diner run, a weekend hike, or a last-minute road trip to the world’s largest ball of yarn.

1kjhg93,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kjhg93/does_the_smug_ice_maker_gn_stand_out_indepth/,Does the SMUG Ice Maker GN Stand Out? In-Depth Review for Buyers,"The SMUG Ice Maker GN has been a constant companion in my day-to-day routine, and let me just say—it’s a game-changer when you're dealing with frequent get-togethers, late-night cravings for iced drinks, or simply beating the heat during the summer. This countertop ice maker’s sleek and compact design immediately caught my attention. Measuring 11” x 8” x 12”, it fits perfectly on my kitchen counter without taking up too much space. Plus, the addition of a sturdy handle makes it effortless to transport, whether I’m hosting a backyard party or packing it up for a camping trip.

**Portable Functionality**  
Carrying this ice maker around is surprisingly easy due to its lightweight construction (just 16.74 pounds). I’ve brought it along to family gatherings and even small office events without breaking a sweat. The portability, combined with its stylish green finish, really elevates its appeal compared to bulkier, less attractive machines. This nifty gadget feels designed for modern living, and even my guests have been impressed by how convenient it is.  

[Grab SMUG Ice Maker GN deals on Amazon now.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b09bvwbmjp/)

**Speed and Ice Production**  
One of the standout features is the remarkable speed with which it churns out ice. In my experience, the claim of producing 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes in just 6 minutes is absolutely accurate. Whether I’m wrapping up a wine-and-cheese night or preparing iced coffee for my wife on a rushed morning, this quick turnaround adds immense value. Over 24 hours, it can create a whopping 26.5 pounds of ice, ensuring nobody’s glass stays empty during large gatherings.  

**User-Friendly Control Panel**  
The intelligent control panel on this machine is, quite honestly, a lifesaver. Featuring icons for small and large ice sizes, full ice status, water shortage, and the cleaning cycle, it’s incredibly straightforward to operate—even for my neighbor’s tech-shy dad who borrowed it last weekend. Switching between small and large ice cubes is as simple as pressing the “SELECT” button, and the alerts eliminate second-guessing.  

**Auto-Cleaning for Convenience**  
Cleaning appliances has never been my strong suit, so the SMUG Ice Maker’s automatic cleaning function genuinely feels like a blessing. Holding the on/off button for just five seconds initiates a cleaning cycle that maintains the cleanliness of the machine, delivering fresh, uncontaminated ice every time. It’s small touches like these that make this product shine.  

**Favorable Aspects**  
This countertop ice maker really stands out due to:  
- Compact, lightweight design that’s ideal for various settings  
- Quick ice-making speed, producing 9 cubes in 6 minutes  
- Option for two ice sizes (small and large)  
- Smart and intuitive control panel  
- Convenient self-cleaning feature  

**Drawbacks**  
No product is perfect, and after using it for a while, I noticed:  
- The water tank’s 1.5-liter capacity may require frequent refills during high-demand periods  
- Slightly loud operation when making ice—noticeable, but not too disruptive  
- Lack of a storage cooling feature, meaning ice should be transferred to a freezer if not used immediately  

**Product Comparisons**  
Comparing this SMUG unit to other ice makers, it holds its ground but also has room to grow. Against a popular rival like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker, SMUG is undeniably more affordable and lightweight. However, the GE model succeeds with its crushed nugget-style ice and quieter operation. When compared to the COSTWAY Countertop Ice Maker, this product beats it in ice production speed and auto-cleaning functionality, though the COSTWAY unit offers slightly better insulation to keep ice intact for longer durations.  

**Quality for Price**  
Evaluating its performance and features, this ice maker offers great value for its price. It’s highly efficient for small to medium households and fits within a reasonable price range considering its convenience and utility. Larger machines with extra features may exist, but if you prioritize portability, efficiency, and ease of use, this is a stellar choice.

So, many of you fine folks here are great examples of people, doing people things, taking pride in work that others don't have the strength to do. I've done my time in retail, in customer service, it made me insane, but I know what you go through. That also means that I know a truly bad thing when I see it. When a place or a staff 'give up' or when the norm gets lower and lower and lower to the point where even I will go out of my way to slam the hell out of a store. 

Here is what I posted to google reviews, to the online survey, and ultimately to the 800-walmart number. This stuff usually rolls off my back but it was such a horrific fail, that... I Karen'd. And to that end, I'm sorry to the good team members at that store who might get caught in any crossfire as a result of my actions. I don't think anything will come of me pissing in the wind like this, but maybe someone might help them. 

I love online surveys. I just left a scathing review on the walmart survey site and it asked me to review them here too... so... here we go :P  
Went for copy paper and coffee filters. The store was an absolute wreck. Every department but the Market dept looked like a going out of business sale. Nothing made sense, signage hanging awkward, shelves dirty (like gross dust and god knows what), and you could see how dirty because of the massive gaps in product.  
I needed cone filters. I prefer unbleached, because I have no reason to prefer them, but that's what I've used forever, so that's what I use. Since I needed something specific, walmart's answer was, 'we have a 900 pack of what you don't want for less than a 50 pack of what you do want'. Ok fine.  
Copy paper department was... a puzzle box. I almost got to work fixing it for them. Pricing was all over the place for the products, but I wasn't getting nose to those dirty old shelves to read the tiny writing. 700 page hp pack... 6.97 sure. At the self checkout, anxiety through the roof, it rings up 10.12. I flag the lady down, tell her it was 6.97 on the shelf, she pulls out her cell phone, opens the wal mart app, scans the paper, ""It's 10.12"". And then she's gone. I'm fine with being wrong, and if I was wrong that's one thing. But using the walmart app because they can't manage their shelves properly to tell me what the system says, outside of where the associates 'stocking' the shelves put it is just insulting, then bailing out before I have a chance to show why I had a different price in mind is just rude.  
This is my first visit to Walmart in about a year. And nothing's changed. It's a poop-show, a f\*\*\* you business. Buy it or leave.  
I bought it and left, because by this point, I could feel my heartbeat in my ears and needed time in the car to cool down before I could go home.  
I gave them money, for stuff I didn't want, at a price that was incorrect, because I couldn't deal with any more of the wal mart. So I guess that's their business model now.

To those of you that take personal offense, please don't. To the lady that I dealt with at the self checkout, yes, be offended, you're in the wrong business, or so burnt out that you're unable to do the basics of peopling... it's time to get out of customer service as soon as possible, because it's clearly having an impact on you in a personal way. I say that as a person who burnt out, takes the pills now, and can never return to customer service.

Feel free to flame me in DM's if you think I'm being unfair or too one sided. I accept that I don't know all the moving parts. 
If you think you know where I was, feel free to ask in DMs. 
If you happen to work at the location that I was at, I'll be happy to show my real face, and listen to why this is normal and maybe pull some of the ruffle out of my feathers. 

How did this happen? Why has it been like this for so long that the same nasty reviews on this store go back years.

Educate me, please. 
edited to take out some markup cause I've never tried it in reddit and I'm obviously too dumb to manage it. And too dumb to walmart.

- thank you

hello,

I (20M) have upcoming exams that are very very important to me (/ progression of my course).
I have been trying to organise ADHD medication for myself for about 7/8 months, and I haven’t been able to get them in time for my exams. (Although I have arranged to start a prescription very soon - not soon enough to be effective for these exams though)
(I am already diagnosed with ADHD and find it impossible to focus without self medicating / LOADS of coffee / weed etc…)

I recently got ADHD meds from my friend and was taking them in order to help my revision (dexamfetamine 30mg). 
I’ve done this before but with lower doses, I.e 10-20mg and been absolutely fine 
(if anything they improved my quality of life exponentially)
But I made the stupid mistake this time of not taking them regularly, and also doing so whilst being under an IMMENSE amount of stress, with my exams and multiple other personal factors. (+ stronger dose)…

Today at around 2:00pm I felt the muscles in my whole body feel extremely tingly + weird. And the muscles in my arms and hands started to contract, after about 6-7 minutes it got worse and worse until I went to my housemates room for serious help because my throat muscles started to seize up and I was having difficulty breathing. 
She called an ambulance for me, and about Half way into the conversation with emergency services, everything started to clear up = easier to breathe again, muscles stopped contracting, and I felt largely normal. 
I cancel the ambulance and get driven to the hospital and the GP says it’s likley because of the meds / irregularity of dosage (I agree) and also a possible combination of this with a panic attack / stress (which kind of makes sense)
My friends who study medicine / care said it was a textbook example of a minor seizure 
And I kind of agree.
(I’ve never had a seizure or anything close before in my life)


So here’s my situation:

I am due to start (prescribed) ADHD medication in the next couple of weeks, I feel as though this is important information to tell my doctor as it’s extremely relevant (and I plan to do so)
But I am now absolutely TERRIFIED that once I tell my doctor this he will cut me off from his service and I will not be able to get ADHD medication because I will be seen as irresponsible.
And if I don’t get ADHD meds prescribed there is no way in high hell I am going to be able to finish my degree, (which is something I CANNOT afford / NOT an option)
but equally this is not something I should hide from him as it was quite a serious event.


I’m looking for advice to my situation…

1. Do you think my Dr will not prescribe me if I tell him what happened ?
(I will only self medicate further if this is the case)

2. (I really don’t want to, but) if I lie to him do you think this is a bad option ?
It would likely mean I would get my prescription guaranteed. But it could be extremely dangerous as I could have another reaction (and he would Likley find out anyways through NHS records…)
BUT
If I don’t get ADHD medication I am absolutely 100% failing my degree which would feel world-ending to me!

I desperately need advice on this situation, as I now feel as though I am beyond my stress threshold, and this recent (minor) ‘seizure / reaction / panic attack’ has added a considerable amount of pressure to my situation. I have absolutely no idea what to do.

Advice from anyone (but particularly people who have dealt with the ADHD medication process) would be extremely helpful as it feels I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, and freaking out an little bit.",1,1746902696.0,ADHDmeds,1,1.0,False

1kjh8qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stobotnik/comments/1kjh8qa/ashes_of_the_iron_storm/,Ashes of the Iron Storm,"# [Chapter 1](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63811042/chapters/163627189): The Phantom of the Dunes

The wind howled across the barren wasteland, kicking up spirals of dust that danced like specters beneath the molten sun. Once, this land had been green—rolling hills of emerald, rivers that sang as they carved through the land. Now, it was a graveyard of rust and ruin, a world where only the cruel or the quick survived.  
Sonic the Hedgehog was both.  
He ran, as he always had. Through valleys of shattered steel and past the bones of cities long devoured by time, his feet barely kissed the scorched earth before launching him forward again. The world was a blur, a haze of burnt ochre and crumbling towers. Behind him, the desert roared—not the wind, but the sound of engines.  
""There he is!"" A voice crackled through the static of a radio.  
Sonic didn't need to turn his head. He felt the tremors beneath his feet, the vibrations of an approaching convoy. Robotnik's war rigs.  
With a grin sharper than the jagged metal that littered the wastes, Sonic pushed harder. The world stretched into streaks of light, the horizon bending as he blurred through the sand.  
The machines behind him were fast. He was faster.  
But even legends get tired.  
The sand beneath him shifted, and Sonic’s footing faltered for a fraction of a second—just long enough. A blast from a mounted energy cannon struck the ground beside him, sending a geyser of burning earth into the sky. Sonic twisted, narrowly avoiding the explosion, but the shockwave sent him tumbling, skidding across the dunes.  
Engines growled like hungry beasts. The convoy encircled him, war rigs screeching to a halt, tires carving deep scars into the dirt. A dozen twisted machines, all rust and jagged steel, loomed over him. And perched atop the largest of them, sipping casually from a delicate porcelain cup, was Agent Stone.  
""You know,"" Stone mused, adjusting his sunglasses, ""for a phantom, you sure do leave a lot of footprints.""  
Sonic pushed himself to his feet, dusting the ash from his quills. ""Yeah? And for a guy named Stone, you sure talk a lot.""  
Stone smirked, raising a hand. The war rigs roared to life, weapons adjusting their aim. ""Dr. Robotnik wants a word, rodent. Why don’t you come along quietly?""  
Sonic rolled his shoulders. ""Yeah, see, 'quiet' really isn't my thing. But running? That, I do pretty well.""  
Before the Iron Baristas could react, Sonic spun into a whirling blur of blue light, slamming into the nearest war rig. The force sent it skidding sideways, crushing two smaller bikes beneath its treads. Soldiers shouted, scrambling to regroup, but Sonic was already moving, a streak of motion weaving between the wreckage.  
Stone sighed, setting his cup down. ""Every. Damn. Time.""  
With a flick of his wrist, he signaled. From the largest rig, a mechanical behemoth uncoiled—a robotic hound with blades for teeth and an engine for a heart. The Blood Hound.  
It lunged.  
Sonic had a second to react. He twisted mid-stride, barely dodging as the beast slammed into the ground beside him, claws carving trenches into the dirt. It pivoted instantly, hydraulic legs adjusting for a second strike.  
Before it could pounce, a shadow streaked overhead.  
Then, fire.  
A missile struck the Blood Hound’s side, sending it sprawling. Sonic shielded his eyes as an explosion split the air. From above, the sound of rotors cut through the chaos.  
""Need a lift?"" came a voice through the static.  
Sonic grinned. ""Took you long enough, Tails.""  
The Cyclone swooped down, its rusted but sturdy frame a patchwork of salvaged parts and brilliance. Tails maneuvered expertly, lowering the hatch as Sonic leapt, grabbing hold just as the engines roared to full power.  
Below, Stone watched as the aircraft lifted into the sky. He adjusted his suit, retrieving his now slightly dusty cup. ""You know what I hate? Cold coffee.""  
One of his soldiers hesitated. ""Uh... should we go after them?""  
Stone took a slow sip, then sighed. ""No. Let them run. Running only gets you so far.""

Sonic collapsed into the co-pilot’s seat, catching his breath as Tails maneuvered the Cyclone through the storm of rising dust.  
""That was close,"" Tails said, checking the controls. ""Stone’s getting smarter. They almost had you that time.""  
Sonic exhaled. ""Yeah, well, 'almost' doesn’t count.""  
Tails shot him a look. ""You can’t keep doing this alone, Sonic. We need a plan. We need—""  
""We need a miracle,"" a voice cut in.  
Sonic turned as Knuckles stepped into the cockpit. His red fur was matted with dust and sweat, his armor scraped from battle. He leaned against the wall, arms crossed. ""Robotnik’s growing stronger. He’s taken the last known Chaos Emeralds. Soon, he’ll have enough energy to power that war machine of his. And when that happens? There won’t be a wasteland left to run in.""  
Sonic’s fists clenched. ""Then we take them back.""  
Knuckles huffed. ""From what? A fortress that moves? A mobile death trap the size of a city? We’d be walking into a slaughterhouse.""  
""So we don’t walk,"" Sonic said, eyes narrowing. ""We run. We hit fast, hit hard. Shadow's out there somewhere. If we find him, we have a chance.""  
Knuckles was silent for a moment, then gave a sharp nod. ""Then we move. We find Shadow. And we take the fight to Robotnik.""  
The three looked out over the wasteland as the sun bled into the horizon. The road ahead was long, and the war was far from over.  
But they weren’t running anymore.  
They were coming for him.

# [Chapter 2](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63811042/chapters/163758454): Shadows in the Sand

The night was alive with the hum of engines, distant but ever-present. The wasteland never truly slept; war rigs prowled the dunes like hungry beasts, searching for the next scrap of Chaos Energy, the next unlucky soul to fall into Robotnik’s grip. But here, high above the sands in the Cyclone, Sonic and his crew were safe—at least for now.  
Tails adjusted the controls, his twin tails flicking behind him as he scanned the horizon. ""We’re heading west. There’s an old hideout near the Rift Canyon—one of Shadow’s old haunts. If he’s anywhere, it’s there.""  
Knuckles leaned back against the wall, arms crossed. ""If he’s anywhere, it’s probably causing trouble. That guy’s got more issues than an Eggman monologue.""  
Sonic chuckled. ""Yeah, but we need him. No one knows Robotnik’s playbook like Shadow. If we’re gonna take down the Eggtanic, we need every edge we can get.""  
Tails shot him a glance. ""That’s if he doesn’t try to kill us first. You remember the last time we saw him, right? He wasn’t exactly... friendly.""  
""He never is,"" Knuckles muttered.  
The air grew heavy at the memory. The last time they had crossed paths with Shadow, he had been different. More ruthless. More lost. Robotnik had twisted him once before, and there were rumors—whispers in the wasteland—that he was working for the warlord again.  
Sonic shook his head. ""We’ll deal with that if it comes to it. For now, we find him.""

The Cyclone touched down at the edge of Rift Canyon, its battered frame groaning as the engines powered down. The landscape stretched before them—a chasm of jagged rock and twisted steel, remnants of a battle long forgotten. The air smelled of oil and decay, and somewhere in the distance, something howled.  
Knuckles was the first to step out, his boots crunching against the cracked earth. ""Real inviting place. No wonder Shadow likes it.""  
Tails adjusted his goggles. ""Stay sharp. If he’s here, he already knows we are.""  
Sonic led the way, moving with the quiet grace of someone who had spent his life outrunning death. The canyon walls loomed high, casting long shadows under the dim glow of the shattered moon. Every step felt like an intrusion.  
Then, a voice.  
""You shouldn’t have come.""  
Sonic barely had time to react before a blur of black and red dropped from the cliffs above, landing with the force of a detonated mine. Shadow.  
His crimson eyes glowed in the darkness, piercing through the dust and moonlight. His leather combat gear was scarred from battle, his jet-powered bike, Black Doom, idling behind him like a caged beast. A golden ring spun between his fingers, the energy crackling like restrained fury.  
Sonic smirked. ""Hey, Shads. Miss us?""  
Shadow’s response was a bullet of motion. He lunged, faster than any of them could react. Sonic barely dodged the first strike, rolling just as Shadow’s fist shattered the rock where he had stood a second before.  
""Okay, so no hugs. Got it.""  
Knuckles leaped into the fray, swinging hard. Shadow met him head-on, blocking with a burst of Chaos Energy that sent Knuckles skidding backward. Tails pulled a shock pistol from his belt, but before he could fire, Shadow vanished, reappearing behind him in a swirl of red light.  
""Too slow.""  
He struck, but Sonic intercepted, kicking Shadow away in a flash of blue light. They stared each other down, both breathing heavily, both waiting.  
Then, Shadow lowered his fists.  
""You’re persistent,"" he muttered.  
Sonic grinned. ""Yeah, I get that a lot. Look, we’re not here to fight you. We need your help.""  
Shadow scoffed. ""Help? That’s funny, coming from you. The last time we fought together, I nearly died.""  
Knuckles crossed his arms. ""Yeah, well, we all did. Welcome to the wasteland.""  
Shadow’s eyes flickered with something unreadable. Then, with a sigh, he turned away. ""You don’t understand. If you’re here, it’s already too late.""  
Tails frowned. ""Too late for what?""  
Before Shadow could answer, the ground trembled.  
The distant hum of engines had grown into a roar. From the horizon, headlights flared like the eyes of a beast. War rigs. Dozens of them.  
Shadow cursed. ""Robotnik’s scouts. They must have followed you.""  
Knuckles cracked his knuckles. ""Good. I was getting bored.""  
Sonic grinned, stepping forward. ""Time to send a message.""  
Shadow hesitated, then smirked. ""Hmph. Just don’t slow me down.""  
The wasteland exploded into chaos.

The first war rig barreled into the canyon, a spiked monstrosity belching smoke and fire. Sonic was already moving, dashing forward and vaulting over the twisted metal frame, his spin attack carving through the rusted hull. The rig swerved violently before crashing into the rocks, engulfed in flames.  
Knuckles tore through another, his brute strength ripping metal apart like paper. Tails soared above, the Cyclone raining down fire from above, strafing the enemy ranks with precision.  
And then there was Shadow.  
He was a blur of violence, teleporting between war rigs in bursts of red energy. His strikes were precise, each movement calculated. Where Sonic was a storm, Shadow was a scalpel, cutting through the enemy with lethal efficiency.  
Stone’s voice crackled over the radio waves. ""Well, well. The whole gang’s here. And here I was, thinking I’d have to hunt you down one by one.""  
Sonic dodged another attack, flipping onto the roof of a moving rig. ""Hey, Stone! Hope you brought extra sugar for this one, 'cause it’s gonna sting.""  
""Oh, I brought something better.""  
The ground trembled.  
Then, from the dust, it appeared.  
A monstrous war rig, towering over the battlefield. The Iron Grinder. Its front was lined with spinning saws, its back bristling with artillery. It was a rolling fortress, a machine built for destruction.  
Shadow clenched his fists. ""That’s new.""  
Knuckles grinned. ""Dibs.""  
Tails banked the Cyclone overhead. ""We can’t fight that thing head-on. We need a plan!""  
Sonic cracked his knuckles. ""I got one. Shadow, you up for a race?""  
Shadow smirked. ""You know I don’t lose.""  
""Good. Let’s bring this thing down.""  
The two hedgehogs blurred into motion, streaks of red and blue weaving through the battlefield as they charged the Iron Grinder. The war for the wasteland had only just begun.

# [Chapter 3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63811042/chapters/164078317): A Love Forged in Steel

The battlefield still smoldered, wreckage scattered like the bones of fallen titans. The Iron Grinder lay in ruins, its saw blades twisted and sparking, its cannons silenced by the combined fury of Sonic and Shadow. The victory was theirs—at least for now.  
But elsewhere, in the depths of Robotnik’s fortress, another battle was being fought.  
A battle of the heart.

Agent Stone stood atop the balcony of the Eggtanic, gazing out over the endless wasteland. The air reeked of scorched oil and melted metal, but to him, it was perfume. He took a slow sip of his perfectly brewed latte, letting the bitterness settle on his tongue.  
He was troubled.  
And the trouble’s name was Dr. Ivo Robotnik.  
For years, Stone had been by Robotnik’s side. First as an assistant, then as a confidant, and now... something more. Something unspoken. The man was a genius, a force of nature, a god of machinery wrapped in a crimson coat. He was ruthless, cunning, and utterly, undeniably captivating.  
Lately, Stone found himself watching the doctor more closely—lingering on the way he ranted, how his gloved hands moved with manic precision, how his laughter filled a room with a gravity that made Stone’s knees weak.  
It was maddening.  
And yet, as he stared into the horizon, he allowed himself a moment of weakness. A sigh, barely audible.  
""You’re thinking too hard, Stone.""  
The voice snapped him back to reality. Robotnik stood behind him, illuminated by the glow of the fortress lights. His mustache twitched as he studied Stone with those piercing, calculating eyes.  
Stone straightened. ""Sir. The attack on Rift Canyon—""  
""Yes, yes, the attack was a spectacular failure,"" Robotnik interrupted, waving a dismissive hand. ""Sonic and his ragtag band of idiots won the day, and I lost a perfectly good war rig. I should be furious."" He leaned forward, a twisted grin spreading across his face. ""And yet... I find myself amused.""  
Stone arched an eyebrow. ""Sir?""  
Robotnik turned away, pacing. ""They’re getting desperate, Stone. They’re running out of places to hide, out of luck, out of time. And desperation makes people reckless. Recklessness makes them weak."" He turned back to Stone, eyes gleaming. ""They think they can stop me, but they’re only accelerating their own demise. And that... that is delicious.""  
Stone had heard this speech a thousand times, yet he hung onto every word, enthralled by the sheer presence of the man.  
Then Robotnik did something unexpected.  
He stepped closer.  
Close enough that Stone could feel the heat radiating from him, smell the faint traces of machine oil and burnt ozone that clung to his coat.  
""You’ve been distracted, Stone.""  
Stone swallowed. ""Never, sir. My focus is always on you—on our mission.""  
Robotnik’s grin widened. ""Is it now?""  
For the first time in his life, Agent Stone was at a loss for words. He had faced battles, outmaneuvered enemies, and built an empire of steel alongside this man, but nothing had prepared him for this moment.  
Robotnik let the silence stretch, reveling in it. Then, with a chuckle, he turned on his heel. ""We have work to do. The Eggtanic needs more firepower. The next time Sonic and his pests come sniffing around, we crush them beneath our treads.""  
Stone exhaled slowly, his grip tightening around his coffee cup. ""Yes, sir.""  
Robotnik paused at the doorway. ""Oh, and Stone?""  
Stone snapped to attention. ""Sir?""  
The doctor’s voice was almost a purr. ""Make sure my latte is extra frothy next time. I like it when you put care into the details.""  
With that, he was gone, leaving Stone standing alone on the balcony, heart pounding against his ribs.  
He brought his cup to his lips, but the coffee had long since gone cold.  
For the first time, he didn’t mind.

Meanwhile, across the wasteland, the resistance was regathering. The battle had been won, but war loomed on the horizon. Shadow leaned against the wreckage of the Iron Grinder, watching as Knuckles and Tails debated their next move.  
Sonic sat nearby, drumming his fingers against his knee. ""Shadow.""  
The black hedgehog glanced at him. ""What?""  
""Back there, when we fought side by side... felt good, didn’t it?""  
Shadow scoffed. ""Don’t get sentimental, Sonic. I’m here because Robotnik has something that belongs to me. When this is over, so are we.""  
Sonic smirked. ""We’ll see.""  
As the night stretched over the wasteland, two forces prepared for the battles ahead—one fueled by rebellion, the other by an obsession as deep as the void.  
And at the heart of it all, Agent Stone stood on the precipice of something far more dangerous than war.

Then brought up plans again with the same group of people weeks later and I told him no thank you. Several hours later I get a text asking me to go get coffee with him instead. What’s his deal?

Long yap but I need to vent.
Basically, I live back at my grandma’s house, and my oldest brother—who’s almost 30—lives here too. He’s a full-blown tweaker. His drug of choice is meth, but he’s also a fat-ass pothead. He's always yelling, talking gibberish, punching holes in the walls, breaking stuff, and leaving a mess. It’s a whole shitshow. And my grandma? She just lets it happen. Gives him cigarettes, money, food—whatever he wants. He’s like her grown baby who does no wrong. Literally............ he's like God to her.

And Me? I don't play that. I set boundaries. I stopped cleaning up after him. I used to clean that house from top to bottom four to five times a day. No joke. I'd finish the kitchen, go to the bathroom, come back, and boom—kitchen trashed again. I cleaned more than I took care of myself. The bathroom? Looked like someone took a bath in motor oil. Greasy black film on the tub. Counters and floor  covered in cereal, peanut butter, sugar, coffee—you name it. My brother would trash the whole house and expect it to magically be spotless, and my grandma acted like it was my job. The second I stopped, she had a problem.

Anyway—last night I got home from the gym, showered, and was getting ready for bed. My brother was in one of his “clear-minded” states (which just means he's not yelling or tweaking out loud). He asked me, “Hey lil sis, you got some good weed? Wanna share?”
I already had a blunt rolled for my post-gym chill, so I was like, “Fuck it, I’ll smoke with him real quick, then knock out.”

Now, I’m the type of person in a smoke circle who zones out on my phone. I’m not clocking every movement—just minding my business and passing the blunt back when it’s time. But halfway through smoking, I glance over—and I swear I see pink. Like, below the waist pink. At first my brain couldn’t even process it. I started shaking. My stomach turned to knots.

So I put my phone on record, grabbed my lighter and roach clip, and dipped the fuck out. I didn’t even need to look at the video—I knew what I saw. I ran to the bathroom and had a full meltdown. But then I realized… I’m still in the house. The same house as him. So I booked it to the RV out back where I could lock the door and breathe.

And this isn’t the first time. A while back, he did something similar. I assumed he was on acid or just being gross and high out of his mind. My grandma and I were talking when we suddenly heard this fat-ass thud. I walk out, see him running from his room, and within 40 seconds of trying to talk to him about kids and safety and decency, I see the same thing in my peripheral. I dipped again. I told my grandma and mom. Grandma said, “Well why were you looking?”
Lady—HE WAS IN THE LIVING ROOM. What?
And my mom? She tells him, “Just make sure you zip up, no one wants to see that.”
That’s it. No consequences. Just “zip up.”

So this time, when it happened again—I knew it wasn’t some coincidence. It wasn’t a “one-off” or a “bad trip.” It was a pattern. And I’m not going to be silent about it anymore. Every time I bring up how uncomfortable and unsafe I feel, I’m told, “If you don’t like it, then leave.”
But what if it’s not me next time? What if it’s someone else? My grandma’s older now. She can’t defend herself like I can. That thought alone terrifies me.

And here's the part I haven’t told anyone until now:
Part of the reason I even had the instinct to record him is because I’ve already been through this shit. I was molested by another brother when I was younger. That trauma never left. It sits in my chest, in my gut, in the back of my mind. It’s why I knew something was wrong before I even consciously registered what I saw.
So I hit record not just for proof—but for my own sanity. To make sure I wasn’t going crazy. To know I saw what I saw. And maybe, one day, when I feel safe, I’ll show someone. But right now? I can’t. Because I know even with proof, my family would deny it. That’s how toxic they are. They protect the abuser and shame the one speaking up.
 
And after all that, I ended up calling my boyfriend. He was at work, but I was freaking the fuck out. I needed someone to just be there, even if it was just on the phone. I was crying, shaking, having a full-on breakdown and just needed someone to stay on the line while I tried to fall asleep in the RV because I felt so unsafe and sick. I didn’t even feel real.

Then this morning, I saw this autistic man eating a hot dog on my insagram feed and he was just so into it like zoned out but really enjoying it. And I sent it to my bf and was like, “Damn, I don’t know what he’s feeling right now but I wanna feel like that. Just calm. Happy. Safe eating a safe food .”
And my boyfriend said, “What? Like him eating the hot dog… or a glizzy in your mouth?”

Like… are you serious?

After everything I told him the night before, that’s what he came back with? That shit hurt way more than I expected. I went quiet. I didn’t even know what to say. It made me feel stupid for even opening up in the first place. Like even when I try to be vulnerable, I get hit with some disrespectful joke. It made me feel gross. Like I was overreacting, like none of what I said even mattered. 

So here I am crying writing my letters to my therapist abt all this going on because my lips cannot speak without literally choking on my tears

Day 9 of tapering from coffee to green tea, with the intention to eventually be caff free. 

As life has gotten back to busy now it begins to be a bit challenging. 

I am once again tired in the mornings, because I simply am not going to bed as early as I should for the time that I need to be awake. 

Yesterday I had a 12 hour work/ school day… started the morning with a cup of long jing tea I brewed at home (supposed to be fairly low caffeine). By mid day I felt I needed a pick me up and I got a Hojicha latte. 

The pros were that I didn’t feel anxious like I would with coffee, and that my digestion is better than with coffee. 

The cons are that I still spent money on a caffeinated beverage, and that I had 2 cups of tea where I’m really setting the standard of 1 At this time. 

So I stayed up a bit later than I should have and since I didn’t get to sleep in today, that’s a Bummer. 


Today I had my one green tea, and I’ll stick with that and really looking forward to a peaceful long night of sleep after work 😍


Posting for accountability. All and all, I still consider this to be great progress! I know I’ll have more time to sleep and detox come June.

I get on tiktok and Instagram this week (nurses week here in the US) to see people complaining about how ‘entitled’ nurses are. For context: a few large chain coffee shops had advertised a free drink for nurses on May 6th and in really small text it indicated that only certain locations were participating, and some nurses were frustrated with it. People are in the comments and stitching these videos accusing nurses of being entitled and spoiled and this one comment in particular has me up a wall: 
“What about free coffee for sales people/ office workers? Imao we deal with absolute hell on a daily basis and we're not complaining about non existent free coffees smh” 

- we work 12 hour days for shit pay making sure YOUR loved ones don’t die 
- when a client is screaming at you, you get to hang up the phone and turn to your coworker or your friend and say “man what a bitch.” When a parent or patient is verbally or physically abusive to me I get to finish my 12h with them providing the same quality of care and then politely request not to have them back the next day 
- When you have a bad day at work you didn’t sell enough or you didn’t meet a goal. When I don’t meet a goal or do enough or have a hard day at work it means someone is critically ill, maybe dead, and I couldn’t do enough to help them 

I responded to a trauma in an ER several months ago: a patient had been brutally stabbed to death. There was nothing we could do. My “hell on a daily basis” is not the same as yours. I’m not trying to invalidate or minimize what anyone else experiences, but that comparison in response to a nurse being frustrated that a business didn’t come through with what they promised is crazy talk. 

Nurses week is not something we are entitled to and we don’t expect gifts or free things. However, if an organization says “we appreciate what you do and we would like to do something nice for you” and then you show up for the nice thing and it isn’t there, yeah that’s annoying whether you’re a nurse or not. Nurses week is not a reward for doing a run of the mill job. Nurses week is a show of appreciation for people who are with your vulnerable loved ones 24/7 doing taxing physical and emotional labor, putting themselves second, third, and fourth to the needs of others, and get paid on the same level as an Amazon employee in some states. I’m so fortunate to work for an organization that compensates me more than others in my area, but the majority of hospitals do not. The majority of hospitals have nurses in unsafe and inappropriate situations with a lack of support and resources. ",2,1746902010.0,venting,2,1.0,False

I have been creeping here for ages and would love to share the long story of how I came to be diagnosed at 38 but we I’ll keep it short as possible.

Have been dealing with physical and mental health stuff my whole life. Been treated like an annoyance and a let down and a failure and everyone jokingly had called me ADHD. Have been nicotine, caffeine, and tree seeking for 2 decades now and decided maybe to try pursuing  a diagnosis. My pcp has an in-house therapy/mental health concierge that made me a list of doctors and therapists in my network that accepts my insurance. Found one, got in, got the intake appointment done and was referred to a psychiatrist in the practice. She talked with me for 2 hours (teletherapy appointment). She was AMAZING and got me on amphetamine salts 10mg

How is it that one day in and I’m calmer than I have ever been? How does a stimulant do this?  I guess I was anticipating to be hopped up. I didn’t want coffee, haven’t been reaching for nicotine punches. I’m extremely excited about that. I think the most encouraging part is that she said if we have success, she wants to take my GAD and MDD off of my chart-for they are just symptoms of the AdHD and the shame I have felt for years. I can already tell this is life changing but I’m keeping it on the down low. I have my husbands support and my doctors support, what else do I need?

1kjgvit,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1kjgvit/how_does_kroser_hardside_carryon_luggage_compare/,How does KROSER Hardside Carry-On Luggage compare? A detailed review inside!,"The **KROSER Hardside Expandable Carry On Luggage with Spinner Wheels & Built-in TSA Lock** has been an interesting addition to my travel lineup. As someone frequently on the move, I’ve tested my fair share of carry-ons, so this one had a lot to live up to. Its combination of form, functionality, and durability caught my attention—and for the most part, it delivered.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right off the bat, the luggage gave a good impression with its sleek and modern aesthetic. The white PC hard shell feels luxuriously glossy but also surprisingly tough. It held up well even after a few flights and multiple train rides, refusing to succumb to scratches beyond the superficial. The integrated TSA-approved lock is a reassuring addition and was easy to program. A small detail, but the ergonomic telescopic handle—adjustable to different lengths—stood out for its comfortable grip. This might seem trivial until you’re sprinting through an airport with a cup of coffee in one hand and dodging strollers and suitcases. The spinner wheels deserve a mention too. They’re remarkably smooth and sturdy, even on rough cobblestones or carpeted surfaces that usually snag other wheels.

**Upsides**  
- Surprisingly lightweight while still sturdy.  
- Spinner wheels glide effortlessly on most terrains.  
- Expandable feature provides additional storage space for souvenirs (a dangerous feature for shopaholics like me!).  

[Ready to snag KROSER B0C6DTTQWM? See Amazon’s price.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0c6dttqwm/)

**Interior Features**  
Packing this suitcase was unexpectedly satisfying. The main compartment has thoughtful features like cross straps and zippered sections to secure clothes in place. Each half is divided with substantial zippered flaps, meaning no more rogue socks flying out if TSA unzips your luggage. The waterproof compartment was brilliantly useful for separating toiletries in case anything decided to leak (spoiler: my shampoo bottle totally betrayed me). Additional interior mesh pockets felt cleverly designed for small travel essentials like chargers, snacks, or—if you’re like me, boarding passes you lose track of the second you’re asked for them.

**Key Benefits**  
- Space-efficient with multiple compartments that actually make sense.  
- Includes a USB-A port for charging—useful during long layovers.  
- The suitcase keeps everything neatly contained while in transit, making organized packing and unpacking a breeze.  

**Performance and Travel Compatibility**  
What impressed me most was how travel-friendly it is. Its airlines-approved dimensions (including wheels and handles) fit into the overhead bins of all three flights I took it on—without argument from staff or sideways glances from my fellow passengers. Despite its lightweight design, it didn’t compromise on robustness. During one particularly rushed trip, I tested its limits by shoving in jeans, multiple sweaters, and shoes—thanks to the expansion option—which left it slightly bulging, but fully functional.

**Negative Attributes**  
- Prone to collecting fingerprints and smudges due to the glossy shell.  
- The placement of the USB port felt somewhat awkward, and accessing it while fully packed required unzipping.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this luggage to my previous Samsonite carry-on, I’d say the KROSER bag fares decently. The Samsonite had a more textured finish that hid wear and tear better over time. However, the KROSER stands out in terms of its features, such as the USB port and smoother rolling wheels that didn’t snag as Samsonite’s sometimes did. On the budget end, AmazonBasics offers a similar size hard-side luggage. Still, KROSER’s superior materials—particularly the explosion-proof zippers—and added organizational enhancements put it a step ahead. But for minimalists who just need a simple carry-on, some might argue those extra features can be overkill.

**Value for Money**  
This bag delivers a lot for its price point. The materials used—particularly the durable PC shell—combined with user-friendly features make it competitive with more premium brands. Sure, someone on a tight budget might gravitate toward cheaper options, but if you’re prioritizing reliability and convenience, this feels like a worthy investment. With a variety of colors available, it also scores points for aesthetic flexibility.

I was not really in a relationship as such as we didn’t discuss any tags or something so i considered it a situation-ship.

I’m Arka, Cal grad, proud Angeleno, and one of the creators of [*Chaos Agents*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9eIDkv6CY).

Three years ago, I started a game studio with **Richard Garfield**, the creator of *Magic: the Gathering* and someone who inspired me to take up game design as a career. Since we decided to make our studio fully remote, I had to find various spots in LA to work on building our first game.

And that turned out to be one of the best decisions for Chaos Agents. Writing code for Chaos Agents in coffee shops (shoutout to all the late-night K-town, DTLA, and WeHo spots catering to us local nomads), bars (Edmon, Melrose Umbrella, and WeHo Barney's represent!) and hotel lobbies (The Line Hotel is a magical place to get stuff done, trust me) gave me the type of creative inspiration that only Los Angeles can.

After three years of hard but very enjoyable work, we have released a private Alpha for Chaos Agents and are hosting a LAN party in Gardena to celebrate. We did our first LAN party in SF during GDC, and that was an [absolute blast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH-YCUZnmjA), so we decided to do another one in LA. (and Boston during PAX East).

Richard and I would be thrilled if you guys came over to check out the game and participate in the ongoing Chaos World Championship with cash prizes over $1,500 along with many other rewards.

We'll have food, drinks, and an all-around LAN party atmosphere, so bring your friends too! Also for showing up, you'll get one of 5000 private Alpha keys for Chaos Agents, that also gives you perpetual access to Chaos Agents, including its Early Access and full release.

If you are a fan of *Magic: the Gathering* or just games in general, you'll also get to participate in a live Q&A with the legendary Richard Garfield himself.

And who knows, maybe you are destined to be the next Chaos Agents World Champion?

Hope to see you there, feel free to DM me for more info.

1kjgr96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjgr96,The TinHiFi C2 2025 Mech Warrior- High Sex Energy,"Their words, not mine.

Howdy y’all, I’m taking a peek at the TinHiFi C2 2025 Mech Warrior today and according to the back of the box its gonna be a sexy time. We’ve got “N52 High Sex Energy Neody Mium Boron” hiding out in these drivers and I'm not 100% sure what to think, but I'm down.

I was pleasantly surprised by this set. I didn’t expect all that much to be honest given this is marketed as a gaming IEM. And when you have a cheaper set with with a nice shell, usually all of that budget went into making that shell nice. In this case they actually gave us what I think is a nicer driver than in its big brother, the C3 MKII. Both claim to be high sex energy, but the little brother has a composite PU+LCP driver, whereas big brother has just LCP. And we all know silicone is sexy. Thanks to TinHiFi for sending a review set to share my thoughts. 

# Look and Feel

I wasn’t expecting much in the way of accessories when I opened up the box, and I also didn’t get much! This is a $39.99 set, and it was paired with slightly underwhelming accessories. It came with two sets of silicone eartips in small, medium and large that are exactly the same. They work just fine but I tip rolled with Tang Sancai Balanced tips, which are my favorite. Especially for a set like this where I’d like to bring the mids forward a bit.

The cable that came with it is thin and a bit tangle prone. I will say that it keeps surprisingly little memory and doesn’t weigh the set down on your ears. No microphonic interference. However, I needed an immediate cable upgrade for comfort and, well, style.

The shells deserve an upgrade. These are some of the nicest metal shells I’ve ever seen on a sub $50 set of IEM’s. They fit comfortably, and look fantastic. Also, these things are BLACK. Like, Vantablack. They absorb all light, it’s pretty cool.  

# Sound impressions

The C2 2025 Mech Warrior looks like your quintessential gaming headset, and sounds a bit like it too. We have well accentuated bass and treble, giving us a big V shaped sound. Idk if you saw my flair, but my thoughts on which “V” is best are public.

Still, this set does the big V shaped sound correctly. Funny enough, the SeeAudio Neko came to mind when I first started listening to this set, almost the same tuning. Techs are another story, but let it suffice to say I liked the set off the bat. But do I like it enough to invite it in for coffee?

**Bass**

The base is very pleasant with neither too fast or too slow with a decay. Well resolved, in generous quantities. I don’t feel overwhelmed at any point by the bass nor do I feel that the subbass colors the other frequencies to an unpleasant extent. Subbase focus is tracks give you a nice immersive rumble. The midbass kick isn’t too distinctive, but never really leaves me wanting for more. There could be a bit more texture, but this is a $40 single dynamic set so I think it’s doing well by that metric. For its price, I like the bass a lot.

**Mids**

The vocals on the C2 2025 Mech Warrior can be a little recessed but still come through with enough clarity as to not feel like an afterthought. Normally on a single dynamic set this bassy, the sub base would bleed into the mid base and lower mid range, giving us a muddy presentation, but that’s not the case with the mech boy here. Vocals don’t sound hollow or nasally, just a tiny bit in the background.

The sets clarity really helps the mids to retain some character and bite. Stringed instrument retain a texture and noteweight that outperforms similarly priced big v sets. The Chu 2 and 7Hz Zero 2 come to mind.

**Treble.**

I’m a bit treble sensitive, and the set has treble that’s controlled enough for me to wear for a decently long session. That being said, after an hour or so it becomes to be a bit too much for me personally, and I need to switch sets or take a break. It’s an engaging and exciting sound signature, but I enjoy it in moderation rather than wear it all day.

The treble is well done for a budget single dynamic driver set. Pretty well controlled under my normal listening volume but does become a bit splashy when you crank the volume. Sibilance is a fairly consistent presence. It tends not to be too obnoxious, but that varies from track to track.

**Techs**

I thought the technical performance mostly punched above-weight. We had a fairly wide and dynamic sounds stage with enough depth to give you a good sense of space. I do believe these are marketed as gaming headphones so I can see why that would be beneficial. I myself don’t do too much gaming so I can’t help you there, sorry.

The clarity instrument separation and imaging were all impressive for sub $50 and I would say that this set should give in inspiration to other budget competitors. If the tuning were just a bit more neutral, this could easily be a daily driver for me. I can say that I flattened it out a bit using Qdelix 4K and I really enjoyed the performance afterwards. Great techs for the price.

# Final thoughts

I enjoyed the sensuous, sultry sound of the C2 2025 Mech Warrior. It has a nicly balanced big V presentation that’s going to satisfy many that crave that classic sound. Flatheads like me are gonna wanna try something like the Kefine Klean or a Tanchjim 4U if they want something in between. All in all it’s an excellent, balanced, technically impressive set. I wouldn’t kick it out of bed for a little sizzle. Thanks for reading!",9,1746901282.0,iems,5,0.92,False

1kjgp3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFitnessIndia/comments/1kjgp3m/winning_over_suger_sweet_fast_food_craving/,"Winning over Suger, Sweet, Fast food craving","Cravings for sugar and fast food can feel like an uncontrollable urge, but understanding the science behind them and applying effective strategies can help reduce these cravings over time. Here’s a breakdown of what causes these cravings and how to prevent them with science-backed methods.

### **1. Understanding the Cause of Cravings**

**Biology and Evolution:**  
Humans evolved to crave high-calorie foods, especially sugar and fats, because they were once scarce. This helped our ancestors survive during periods of famine. Unfortunately, this primal urge doesn't serve us well in today’s world where unhealthy, processed foods are readily available.

**Blood Sugar Imbalance:**  
When you eat sugar or refined carbs, your blood sugar spikes and then crashes, which leads to feelings of hunger and cravings. Insulin is released to lower your blood sugar, and when it drops too low, your body signals that it needs more food. This cycle can make you crave more sugar and fast food.

**Neurotransmitters and Reward System:**  
Foods high in sugar and fat trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in pleasure and reward. This creates a feeling of satisfaction, which can lead to the desire to repeat the experience, making these foods addictive in nature.

---

### **2. Science-Backed Strategies to Prevent Cravings**

#### **a. Eat More Protein and Fiber**
**Why It Works:**  
Protein and fiber-rich foods help stabilize blood sugar levels and increase feelings of fullness, reducing the urge to snack on sugar and fast food. Research shows that protein, particularly, helps reduce hunger and keep cravings at bay.

**What to Eat:**  
- Lean meats (chicken, turkey, fish)
- Plant-based protein (lentils, beans, tofu)
- High-fiber vegetables (spinach, broccoli, cauliflower)
- Whole grains (quinoa, brown rice, oats)

#### **b. Get Enough Sleep**
**Why It Works:**  
Sleep deprivation disrupts the hormones that regulate hunger, namely leptin (which signals fullness) and ghrelin (which stimulates hunger). Studies have shown that poor sleep leads to higher cravings for sugary and fatty foods, often resulting in overeating.

**What to Do:**  
Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Consistent sleep patterns will help regulate your hunger hormones and reduce the cravings for fast food and sugary snacks.

#### **c. Manage Stress**
**Why It Works:**  
Chronic stress increases cortisol levels, which can increase cravings for comfort foods, especially those high in sugar and fat. Studies indicate that emotional eating is strongly linked to stress and can make it harder to resist unhealthy foods.

**What to Do:**  
- Practice stress-reducing techniques like mindfulness, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.
- Engage in regular physical activity, which can help lower cortisol levels.

#### **d. Stay Hydrated**
**Why It Works:**  
Dehydration can sometimes be mistaken for hunger. Drinking water can help fill you up, which reduces cravings for unhealthy foods. A study found that drinking a glass of water before meals can also help people eat fewer calories.

**What to Do:**  
Drink plenty of water throughout the day. A good rule of thumb is to aim for at least 8 cups (2 liters) of water a day.

#### **e. Gradually Reduce Sugar Intake**
**Why It Works:**  
Suddenly cutting out sugar can lead to withdrawal symptoms, including intense cravings. A more gradual reduction can help minimize these effects. Studies suggest that slowly reducing sugar intake over time can help recalibrate your taste buds and reduce the overall desire for sugary foods.

**What to Do:**  
- Start by reducing the amount of added sugar in your coffee, tea, and snacks.
- Replace sugary snacks with healthier alternatives like fruits, nuts, and yogurt.

#### **f. Eat More Healthy Fats**
**Why It Works:**  
Healthy fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids, can help stabilize blood sugar and reduce cravings. These fats also promote the release of satiety hormones, keeping you fuller longer. Research has shown that increasing intake of healthy fats can reduce the urge for sugar and junk food.

**What to Eat:**  
- Avocados
- Nuts and seeds
- Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel)
- Olive oil

#### **g. Create a Healthy Environment**
**Why It Works:**  
Environmental cues, like the sight or smell of fast food, can trigger cravings. Studies have found that people are more likely to eat unhealthy foods when they’re readily available.

**What to Do:**  
- Stock your pantry with healthy foods and remove processed snacks.
- Prepare meals ahead of time to avoid temptation when you're hungry.

#### **h. Focus on the Psychological Aspect**
**Why It Works:**  
Mindful eating can help you recognize when cravings arise and whether you're truly hungry or just eating out of habit or emotion. Research supports that mindful eating practices can reduce emotional and binge eating.

**What to Do:**  
- Pay attention to how different foods make you feel after eating them.
- Try not to eat while distracted (e.g., in front of the TV or computer).

---

### **3. Conclusion**

Cravings for sugar and fast food are influenced by both biology and environment, but by implementing science-backed strategies like eating more protein and fiber, managing stress, getting quality sleep, and reducing sugar intake gradually, you can take control over these urges. Over time, these practices will help retrain your body to crave healthier foods and make healthier choices easier.

Remember, it's not about perfection, but about progress. By making small, sustainable changes, you’ll break free from the cycle of cravings and build healthier habits that last.

I live in a small hick town and my girlfriend and I decided to visit a nearby city about an hour away. They have a historic downtown area that we visited, a boot barn where I got my cowboy hat reshaped, and of course, a Sprouts grocery store. After most of our endeavors were done for the day, we decided to stop at the Sprouts before heading back home. I just wanted a quick road snack and something to drink. While there, the Dutch Bros coffee I had just drank was quickly working its way through my large intestine. I located the bathroom and told my girlfriend I'll be right back. When I got in there, I went into the stall and immediately noticed that the door latch was a bit wonky. I attempted to lock it, and assumed I did but didn't think much of it. There I am on the toilet peacefully showing my groundhog it's shadow. All is smooth, all is well. After finishing I get up to get some toilet paper and bend over to begin cleaning up. Then to my horror, while in the middle of wiping my hershey highway, a poor Sprouts employee opens the poorly latched stall and stares directly into the soul of my brown eye. He screams, closes the door and rushes out of the bathroom. I quickly finished up and left the bathroom in complete horror. I find my girlfriend and tell her that we need to leave. She demands an explanation as to why but I told her I had no time to explain, we just need to go NOW. 

Needless to say I will never enter a Sprouts ever again, in fear that they will have signs posted everywhere with a picture of me saying ""Beware of the Butt Bandit.""

TL;DR: Went into a Sprouts to get road snacks and use the bathroom. Scared a poor Sprouts employee when they walked in on me wiping my ass and sent them screaming running for their life. ",16,1746901095.0,tifu,16,0.69,False

1kjgmbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1kjgmbz/can_lanranbee_premium_feminine_balance_gummies/,Can LanranBee Premium Feminine Balance Gummies Truly Improve Women’s Health Review?,"Testing out the LanranBee B0DPQPZRXD Premium Feminine Balance Gummies has been an intriguing journey. As someone mindful of daily wellness supplements, I was excited to incorporate these into my own routine while also observing how they might fit into others'. Their promise to support women’s health and wellness, while being vegan, gluten-free, and halal, seemed almost too good to pass up. Each gummy, packed with Hawaiian pineapple flavor, brings a refreshing twist to daily supplementation. Does it live up to the hype? Let's break it down.

**Packaging and Design**  
The compact and straightforward jar fits neatly in my kitchen cabinet, taking no more space than a coffee mug. Its dimensions—4.5 x 2.6 x 2.6 inches—make it convenient to carry if needed, whether it’s for travel or a desk drawer at work. The design itself is minimalistic, focusing on the essentials without over-the-top branding. One issue, however, is the flimsy cap, which doesn’t always feel securely sealed. I wouldn’t risk tossing this jar into a bag without double-checking the lid.  

**Taste and Texture**  
Flavored with Hawaiian pineapple, these gummies are genuinely enjoyable. They’re neither overly sweet nor artificial-tasting, which is often a problem with supplements. The texture is chewy yet soft enough to make them easy on the teeth. My 10-year-old niece, who occasionally sneaks a gummy under my watchful eye (don’t worry, only one!), gave them two thumbs up for flavor. If you dread swallowing capsules or dealing with chalky tablets, this is undoubtedly a pleasant alternative.

[Check LanranBee B0DPQPZRXD price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0dpqpzrxd/)  

**Daily Use and Convenience**  
Popping two gummies a day has been straightforward. You can take them anytime—morning coffee, after lunch, or even before bed. I’ve kept them as part of my post-dinner habit to ensure consistency. Unlike some other supplements on the market, they neither require refrigeration nor have any complicated ingestion schedules. Plus, not needing to pair them with food to avoid an upset stomach is a massive bonus.

**Good Points**  
- Delicious and natural pineapple flavor  
- Vegan, gluten-free, and halal, suiting diverse dietary needs  
- Compact, travel-friendly packaging  
- Easy to integrate into daily habits  

**Nutritional Value and Ingredients**  
The star ingredients like Bacillus Coagulans and Pineapple Fruit Powder caught my attention immediately. Bacillus Coagulans, known for supporting gut health, plays a dual role here in promoting both digestive and vaginal flora balance. Although they’re sugar-free and low-calorie, there's no compromise on taste, which I found impressive. It’s worth mentioning that these gummies are efficient for women seeking to maintain their pH balance and immune support without extra calories sneaking into their diet.

**Bad Points**  
- The lid’s seal could be more secure.  
- Limited flavor options might not suit everyone.  

**Product Contenders**  
There’s no shortage of feminine health supplements on the market, but LanranBee’s Premium Feminine Balance Gummies bring unique aspects to the table. While more established brands like Love Wellness and HUM Nutrition offer similar probiotics in capsule or powder form, they frequently lose marks in flavor profiles or ease of use. Gummies are undeniably friendlier. On the flip side, Love Wellness supplements, for instance, often provide additional vitamins like D and B12, which are absent here. Still, LanranBee stands out for its all-natural and inclusive formulation.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Balancing premium features with affordability is where this product really shines. Without mentioning specific pricing, I’d say these gummies offer solid value for a full month’s supply. Large tablets or multiple capsules can sometimes be wasteful, but with gummies, you’re precisely getting what’s stated on the label: 30 servings of immune and health support in every jar. They aren’t the most budget-friendly among peers, but for what they deliver in convenience and taste, they’re absolutely worth considering.

Like it's not my fault Starbucks doesn't care. I'm not the one making up policies. It's hard to feel bad when you're giving attitude. And honestly I do wish we were doing that instead of the cold foam deal this weekend. ,17,1746900902.0,starbucksbaristas,1,0.96,False
