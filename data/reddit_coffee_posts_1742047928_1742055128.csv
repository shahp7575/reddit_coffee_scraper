1jby78q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1jby78q/looking_for_advice_overmedicated_tsh_went_down/,"Looking for advice, overmedicated, TSH went down after lowering dose","Hi all, a bit of a curious situation I'm in. My doctor is a little confused too, I started at 125mcg and was stable (though I had noticed some slight issues for the last 6 months).

All came to a head after a stomach flu when my TSH dropped to 0.35, doctor dropped me to 100mcg, 4 weeks later the blood test yielded still a high FT4, normal FT3 and a TSH of 0.06.

How the heck did my FT4 stay high, and TSH go down on a lower dose? This is confusing haha. I'm still dealing with a lot of overmedication symptoms, primarily severe anxiety, panic attacks and wacky heart rate.

Only thing I've changed in my morning routine is changing my daily coffee + oat milk to green tea and a lot more water with my synthroid cause I've been waking up a bit dehydrated. I've also been skipping the Synthroid for the last few days with the intention of starting on the lower dose after a week in hopes of getting rid of some of the overmedication symptoms, been 3 days so far and haven't noticed any waning of symptoms yet.

I will say for many years my TSH hovered around 3-5 before medication and I was okay around a TSH of 2-3.

Should I continue taking my lower dose after the break, or go back to the doctor to ask for something more test wise? 

Thanks again everyone! Hope you have a wonderful day!

Lab results are attached!

he was the first one to approach me we bonded well and fast and then we made our three days later, initially this was just supposed to be a rehab fling? but we caught feelings or maybe it was me just trying to fill the void and be busy at my rehab. 
he soon left and the rehab shifted to another location, due to the distance and his inconsistency of communication we drifted. i left rehab in jan 25 and within a week we broke up. 
he would only be interested if it were about phone sex or me paying for his maal since he was out of rehab his actions never matched his words. all i recall is me crying a lot since the breakup. it was js two months and he was my first alleged bf.
to sum up his personality he never really cared for me unless it was sexual, he got mad at me for communicating with him (calling or texting), never texted or called me first unless it was for his benefit literally, said sorry and thought he was off the hook. 
i was warned by all but i didn't listen. 
i have met him thrice since i was out of rehab, at the first meet he bought me a flower and we went to grab coffee, the next few meets were just us talking and he kissed me without my consent which i hated. 
i have blocked unblocked him multiple times, i blocked him yest cuz he again wanted sexual stuff when ive been upfront that im not ready so soon plus im js traumatized by past experiences. 
the thing is i crave for attention like any normal person but i feel shitty that i have to initiate contact w HIM. 
i'd prefer if someone dms me cuz this is just one bit😭😭

- Hub by Premier Inn Goodge Street

Since this morning had a fight with someone I'm now going to be ignoring who was a friend for ten years, and abusive ex who called me accusing me of making an account called ""fart smell"" and following him on it, had fights with a family member when I woke up and then as I'm going to get coffee and get away from people. I'm sitting there drinking coffee and this old man asks for help for something on his phone so I help him. He looked 70 but turns out he was 90 and a millionaire after I'd been fighting with someone else all morning and some of it's to do with financial problems most people who make anywhere from 15-40 an hour all have especially with debt. He gave me investing advice, told me about his sons like who's also a millionaire and how he's waiting to get his inheritance, gambling and about a maid he has he pays 30,000 a years life he always takes out and he told me everything he did it for his wife and he said he did it all because he wanted a companion which made me realize how fucking shitty modern men actually are and ruined by technology. No one's done even 1/4th of what he listed but modern men act like they do everything. The abusive ex started calling me during this and I was getting anxious but then he stopped as the old man left. All this that happened today may not sound weird to other people but it all feels random and out of nowhere. I literally found myself thinking they don't make men the same anymore and even told the older man that no one these days cares about that and it's usually about money etc and everyone is basically miserable because the economy and dating isn't the same. We talked for two hours. I'm 30 and this man was 90 and we had stuff in common?!

I recently came to the realization that espresso is my most preferred coffee making method after trying out pour over and moka pot for a while. I started with just basic budget friendly tools since I'm still in the experimenting phase.

I'm currently using a Timemore C2S hand grinder (I know, it's not ideal for espresso). For espresso machine, I switch between 2 machines as my wife and I have to travel back and forth between 2 places a lot. One is a Delonghi Dedica ec685, and the other is a Stirling 19 Bar Espresso Machine which was gifted to us (I don't see a lot of this brand online tbh).

I recently got a bottomless portafilter for both and have been trying to practice my pulls. So far I've only tried it with the Stirling, and have been getting watery extractions, but with a bit of crema.

Anyway, sorry for the long back story, but the main reason for my post is to ask if anyone has had experience with portable electric grinders similar to the photos I posted. I'm thinking about upgrading our grinder and am looking for an electric grinder that's easy to bring around. Since we travel a lot, it would be inconvenient to have to bring a full grinder with us, and it would be pretty expensive to get two grinders for both places.

Does anyone have feedback for this grinder, the Bincoo D03? Or do you have other portable/small-ish electric grinders you can recommend that would be easy to travel with?

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jbxmqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/doulas/comments/1jbxmqg/struggling_to_find_clients/,Struggling to find clients,"TLDR: I feel like I’m marketing my butt off as cost efficiently as I can but nothing is working. It’s starting to get into my head and I’m getting nervous I will fail.

Hi all, I think I’m more just looking for support here, but I’m really worried about finding more clients. I had to leave my full time job back in May due to a whole bunch of things, so I decided to jump into being a birth doula (my other dream job!) and took my training in September with DONA. I am lucky to be financially supported by my partner while my business grows, but it’s very hard on both of us to be on one income, him especially. I moved to Canada recently and therefore I don’t have many friends and none who are pregnant/know anyone who is pregnant. 

My first client was my only pregnant friend who I did virtual support for pro bono. My second client found me through a $20 meta ad and I just had my last appointment with her the other day. Going into starting my business I didn’t have a ton of funds, and going forward I don’t want to have to pay more money into something I’ve sank over $2,000 into and only made $500 (pre tax) so far with just to maybe get clients. 

I’ve listed the things I’m doing to get clients below, I would love more (free please!) suggestions or even just encouragement from anyone who has gone through the same thing.

-Made a website with updated SEO, around 30-60 visits per week
-Joined a collective of doulas across Ontario (hi if any of you are in here <3)
-Joined the AOD and have an updated page
-I have decent social media, my engagement is usually pretty high with non followers, I even have a reel with over 16k likes and 700k views
-Joined an even more local group chat of doulas, I’ve gotten coffee and chatted with several of them
-I post on my local Facebook groups about once a month
-I handed out flyers and business cards at local businesses including rec centers, coffee shops, and kids stores
-I tried the meta marketing stuff two more times but didn’t get a single bite, not even from spam accounts
-I have joined Bornbir but I’m hesitant to pay for the pro version so I can contact leads
-I am now answering questions for moms on Reddit to keep educating myself and to help people in the meantime
-I am marketing my birth doula services for only $500 so I can get certified and get more clients
-I have set up a google business page and it should hopefully have two reviews on it soon. 

I feel like I’m going crazy, as it’s been 4 months and I’ve only had one other consultation that went flat.

1jbxmq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jbxmq0/my_family_is_lazy_and_its_exhausting/,My family is lazy and it's exhausting,"My close family had always been overweight/obese, including myself. But just a couple of months ago I finally got my act together, got a car and took every advantage to actually make healthy changes. I'm not obese anymore, I'm finally a healthy weight and I'm active again, it wasn't even that hard to balance it between my work and my home time.

But my brother and my parents are just... Lazy. Literally everytime they see me they just go ""oh you look skinny, I could pay you to train me"" even though they've done these personal coach programs a dozen times and they NEVER stick to it. My dad has high blood pressure and my mom is a pre diabetic, but they do ZERO effort to even make a small change.

If you're overweight, counting calories will go a long way, you don't need to do cardio everyday nor you need to hit the gym. But my parents believe that as long as you exercise you can eat whatever and whenever you want, they'll buy fat-free milk, sugar free cookies and drink diet soda. They don't drink much water, they use artificial sweeteners in their coffee and most of the time they will eat out during work, and ever since my brother has introduced them to Uber Eats it's just been much worse because they will make it ANY excuse to not go outside.

My mom watches Netflix all day, hours on end, inspite of having a full-time job, and she works hard at it, but it's a desk job. My dad has completely given up on his health ever since the doctor told him that he needs to restrict food in his diet due to his concerning condition and he simply goes ""well screw it, the doctor basically told me I can't eat anything"" when he was just told to eat more lean/white meats and less red meat with more fruits and vegetables.

It pisses me off because they see me like I'm some gifted person for being actually skinny, no I didn't get skinny out of nowhere, I got skinny because when I got a car of my own I could ACTUALLY take control over my life instead of eating whatever processed trash my parents cook and eat every day. I'm still in my 20s and these two don't ever practice any food discipline but they think I'm just genetically gifted? Like no man I'm YOUR son.

Is it a food addiction? Probably, I've brought that up once to them before and they have said they would ""work on it"" but I haven't seen anything change. I wanted to help them, I encourage them to accompany me to the park or the gym, but I'm over it now. They want a magic pill but that doesn't exist, the magic pill is getting off your ass and actually do something for yourself.",2,1742052597.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

I have been having insomnia at night for the last 4 weeks (and have had trouble falling asleep off and on for a couple months before that). Since I am nursing, my Dr. has only recommended taking Melatonin up to 10mg at bedtime. I have tried this, along with mediation, no screen-time, only half-cup of coffee in morning, a prenatal vitamin, reading before bed, a wind-down routine, shower with melatonin body wash/lotion, acupressure mat, magnesium, earplugs and sleeping seperately from my partner with no success. I am lucky to get 3-4 hours a night, and it takes me hours to fall asleep even when I am tired from reading and struggle to keep my eyes open. My mind is not racing, and it is not anxiety - I am just awake and lying there.

I think it may have to do with my hormones breastfeeding and night-weaning? I don't know how much longer I can function on such little sleep. Did this happen to anyone else? How long did it last? Will it get better soon? I want to keep breastfeeding, and I fear fully weaning could make it worse or may make it better? (hoped to breastfeed to at least 12 months).

1jbxkz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1jbxkz2/29_m4f_bulgaria_europe_online_remote_worker/,29 [M4F] #Bulgaria / Europe / Online Remote worker looking looking for my partner with similar interests and values.,"Alright, I'm gonna go full honesty in this post in order to try and portray myself as clear as I can in order to attract the right people. [My name is Bozhidar](https://imgur.com/a/DnGweD3), I'm 29 and I am currently in Bulgaria right now. I work as a software developer remotely and I am a fan of travelling and living in new places. I'm more of an introvert and love binging movies and TV series, gaming, chilling at home, but at the same time I love the occasional hike and cocktail at a bar.

I am a big fan of spending time together, physical touch and words of affirmation. Cuddling while watching movies, TV series or anime is the dream. Going on walks, playing board games, bowling, pool, eating out, gaming together, travelling together and experiencing new stuff is what I strive for in life. I've visited a couple of countries, including Japan twice, and would love to visit more with a partner, so it would be awesome if you love travelling. Some of the stuff I like:

1. Dates - Walking around the mall, going on walks or to events, bowling, playing pool, having coffee at a cute cozy place, taking little roadtrips.
2. Movies, TV series, anime - GoT, HotD, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, What We Do In The Shadows, South Park, Rick and Morty, Studio Ghibli's movies, Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist, Jujutsu Kaisen, etc
3. Games - Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, Destiny 2, Valorant, LoL, WoW, Terraria, Stardew Valley, etc.

While this is not a requirement, I wanna say that I really dig the e-girl, alt and goth aesthetics even though I myself don't dress or look nothing like it.

Take this with a grain of salt since it's my own description of myself but I consider myself really kind, understanding, patient and loving. I like to treat people right as long as they are not actively trying to be dicks to me. I'm loyal and really hope I'd find someone similar.

It'd be unfair to only list good things about myself so I'll throw in some stuff that I am currently working on that I want to change.

1. I can be slightly possessive from time to time but I would usually just suck it up until that phase passes, or just talk it out in order to iron it out. Because of this, I am not too fond of girls who keep in touch with their exes or who keep chatting to multiple guys all the time.
2. I am on the skinny side but I've been trying to eat right and hit the gym in order to improve in that aspect. If you dislike skinny guys, I'm probably not the right play.

I am a big fan of transparency and honesty so I wanna say that I've only had 1 relationship so far. Some might see this as a green flag and some might see it as a red flag, so I wanted to throw it out.

I'm gonna share some spicy related stuff since I believe this is important for relationships, and incompatibility in this aspect can be a deal breaker for many people. I consider myself quite open minded, and I like to try out new things and introduce new stuff in the bedroom in order to keep things spicy. My point is you wouldn't think I like half the stuff I like by knowing me in real life. I have a very high libido, take pleasure in giving pleasure as well and I always finish the job, one way or another.

If you're curious about anything, you can just ask me straight and I'll answer with full honesty, even if it's something wack. Some photos of me - [https://imgur.com/a/DnGweD3](https://imgur.com/a/DnGweD3)",1,1742052465.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons honey
3 cups flour
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons yeast
(Side note, this is a really tasty basic sandwich loaf recipe)

Topping
Enough room temp butter
Some brown sugar
Plenty of cinnamon
A bit of salt


I throw this all in a bread machine on dough cycle so it handles the kneading and rising for me. 

But if you don’t have a bread machine then knead on a lightly oiled surface with lightly oiled hands, dough should be very smooth. Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl and let rise for 1 hour until puffy. (You can put this dough in the fridge overnight just put it in a lightly oiled bowl tightly covered I usually work with cold dough the next morning and it comes out fine) 

Once dough has risen pinch off dough and shape roughly into 1 inch balls and roll gently on topping to coat each piece in a little butter place balls in a pan (I use an 8x8 but you do you) and set a blob of the topping on each ball. The dough balls should be touching and stacked (this is supposed to be easy enough to do before the coffee kicks in, don’t overthink it)

Bake at 350 for 30 minutes eat warm.

I’ve been dealing with a small Hiatal Hernia with severe symptoms for almost a year now . I went to the ER in July of 24 in the midst of a flare up where I was experiencing severe nausea, constant vomiting , fever , sweats / chills , dehydration from being unable to keep liquids down , and what felt like a heart attack cuz of my irritated vagus nerve from the esophagus acids causing extreme panic / anxiety . The HH and gastritis was detected by a CT scan , they also did a thorough ultrasound. In a nutshell - it’s the worst and most helpless / scared I’ve been in my entire life . 
This is really starting to ruin my quality of life . Missing a lot of work ( typical flare up lasts 2-7 days ) from what I’ve read online , the size of the hernia is irrelevant to the severity of symptoms . I’ve been making difficult lifestyle changes - diet , light yoga / exercise every day , cutting out coffee ( one of my vices 😔) , cutting out alcohol ( not hard for me as I hardly drink but I do work at a winery and wine is a huge passion of mine so it makes me sad ) and last but not least - quitting smoking ( I feel like weed is the only vice / pleasure I have left and now I can’t even do that ) 
I basically feel completely restricted and depleted . I am in constant worry of another flare up happening . When I am in a flare up I’m so miserable I just want to die . 
I can’t seem to find many ppl on here with symptoms similar to mine ….. most of what I’ve read on Reddit at least involve acid reflux , discomfort but seems as if these ppl are still able to go about their day . I’ll be bed ridden for a week unable / too weak to do anything . I guess I am wanting to feel less alone ? Can anyone relate to these symptoms ? And if so - what has helped you ? 
I’ve done a great deal of research and have tried all the deep breathing, diaphragmatic exercises , heal dips in the morning , etc . My doc prescribed me a high dose PPI to try for the next 3 months which I have been really hesitant to take cuz of the negative side effects of long term use of PPIs . I asked for an endoscopy but my doc said to wait to see if the meds help first . 
I don’t know this is all so new and overwhelming to me . I’m 37 and have never experienced any sort of acid reflux until this year . I’m already fed up and feel like I can’t even enjoy life anymore .

All came to a head after a stomach flu when my TSH dropped to 0.35, doctor dropped me to 100mcg, 4 weeks later the blood test yielded still a high FT4, normal FT3 and a TSH of 0.06.

How the heck did my FT4 stay high, and TSH go down on a lower dose? This is confusing haha. I'm still dealing with a lot of overmedication symptoms, primarily severe anxiety, panic attacks and wacky heart rate.

Only thing I've changed in my morning routine is changing my daily coffee + oat milk to green tea and a lot more water with my synthroid cause I've been waking up a bit dehydrated. I've also been skipping the Synthroid for the last few days with the intention of starting on the lower dose after a week in hopes of getting rid of some of the overmedication symptoms, been 3 days so far and haven't noticed any waning of symptoms yet.

I will say for many years my TSH hovered around 3-5 before medication and I was okay around a TSH of 2-3.

Selecting the‌ perfect accent‍ wood chair involves careful consideration of several factors:

**Chapter 1**

The last day of summer vacation is one of the most poignantly glorious 24 hours of the year. It’s a day of final sleep-ins and sunburns, one long, glowingly warm afternoon that stretches lazily across the day like a cat in a pool of sunlight. 

For students, that is.

For teachers it’s Faculty Orientation Day. Or, as Sloane liked to re-acronym it, Fucking Obnoxious Drivel Day.

But there was no indication on that sweltering Texas morning that this would be the most magical, harrowing, and traumatic school year of her life.

Unless, of course, you counted the tooth.

*That* was either a perfectly ordinary occurrence or a dire prophecy of impending horror.

“Why are you awake?” her husband Liam asked as she stumbled into the kitchen, hands flailing for the coffee machine. “It’s Faculty Orientation Day. You *never* go to Faculty Orientation Day.”

“Hasherbum,” Sloane mumbled, pouring coffee into a giant mug emblazoned with the script I BECAME A TEACHER FOR THE MONEY AND THE FAME. “Mushum. Meh.”

“*Daddy,*” their six-year-old son Oliver reprimanded his father through a mouthful of toast. “You cannot ask her any questions until she has her coffee. You have to wait ‘til she swallows and then count to ten.”

Sloane gave him the thumbs up. She took a deep glug of coffee and closed her eyes.

“Did you run out of excuses to get out of it?” Liam asked. “Or did they call your bluff from last year, when you claimed you had bubonic plague?” 

Sloane exhaled, slowly. “I did not say I had *bubonic plague,”* she said. “I told them I had had large, egg-like, hardened swellings in my armpit, neck, and groin, and that the tips of my fingers seemed to be turning black. I left the diagnosis up to their interpretation.”

“Being married to a historian is so weird,” Liam muttered.

“Anyway,” Sloane said, her words gathering speed as the caffeine took effect. “I want to be there today because they’re announcing something *huge*. That was their word: *HUGE.* The teachers think maybe it’s affordable housing for them on campus, or a pay raise, or a schedule change that actually allows us time to use the toilet between classes.”

“Hee hee hee,” their 4-year-old Flora giggled. “Mommy said *toilet*.”

“Mommy goes *poop* at school,” Oliver chortled. 

“With her *butt*!!” Flora yelled.

“Your humor is impeccable,” Sloane said, sliding into a chair next to them. “Obviously you both have high IQs and will go far in life.”

“*Butt*,” Oliver whispered, smothering his giggles. He took a big bite of toast. 

For a few moments there was only quiet chewing and sipping.

Then Oliver started screaming.

“Jesus Christ!” Sloane yelped, her coffee sloshing all over the table. Liam had leapt out of his chair and grabbed his son’s shoulders. “What’s wrong?? Are you OK?”

Oliver spat a glob of blood onto his plate. Nestled in the center was a tiny, milk-white splinter.

A tooth.

“Oh my GOD!” he shrieked, both terrified and incredibly excited. “It just popped out of my *body*! There is *blood* in my mouth!”

“It’s all right, buddy,” Liam said, grabbing a tissue and pressing it against Oliver’s mouth. “It’ll stop in a second. You just lost your first tooth! Yay!”

Sloane sat completely still, staring at the tooth lying on the plate. It was so tiny, barely larger than a fingernail, and had a sharp root that made it look strangely shark-like. It glistened in a small, pink puddle of bloody saliva. 

A strange thread of horror began creeping down her spine. It was like a tickle of terror, making her shiver. She felt it spool in her stomach and then suddenly widen – a bottomless chasm of the deepest dread. The feeling paralyzed her, centering her focus on that tiny, revolting tooth. 

A tiny sliver of a body. A crumb of a skeleton. Teeth, Sloane suddenly realized, are a reminder of the bones beneath us, the only part of a skeleton that shows. The whole rest of that horrible, clattering contraption is sheathed in muscle and fat and blood and skin, but the teeth stick out. Every grin is a macabre reminder of what we will eventually look like when every other piece of us has fallen away. And here was one lying right before her, sharp and raw and smelling faintly of buttered toast.

What a monstrous thing. 

“Sloane?” Liam asked, his voice sounding far away. “Are you OK?”

“Mommy!” Oliver cried, shoving his face between her and the tooth. “Look!!” He grinned at her, and she saw the dark spot in his mouth where the tooth had been. 

A void. A tiny black hole, right in the center of his mouth.

Sloane could feel the blood rushing in her ears. She felt unable to take a breath. She closed her eyes.

Then she felt strong hands on her shoulders, and Liam was shaking her, jokingly yelling “Someone get this lady more caffeine! Wake up, Mommy!”

Flora climbed onto the table and shoved Sloane’s coffee cup toward her. The hot liquid sloshed on her hand, and the sudden jolt of pain made her eyes fly open. The awful terror disappeared so completely it made her gasp for breath.

“Whew!” Sloane said, shaking her head vigorously. She lifted the mug and took several big slugs of coffee, feeling suddenly giddy with relief. What a weird moment that had been – a vestige from a dream or something. 

Everyone had existential crises sometimes. Probably everyone had mornings where the reality of their own mortality smashed them right between the eyes. So common no one ever talked about it.

Sloane reached for a paper towel to mop up the mess from two coffee spills. “This is excellent news, bud!” she told Oliver, who was looking at her with his brows furrowed. “The Tooth Fairy is gonna come tonight!”

“What?” Oliver asked, and at the same time Flora squealed “A *fairy*?”

“Yeah!” Liam said, enthusiastically. “When you lose a tooth you put it under your pillow and the Tooth Fairy comes at night to collect it, and leaves you money\*.\*” 

“Money fairies!” Flora yelled, clapping her hands enthusiastically.

“The Tooth Fairy comes to take my tooth?” Oliver repeated. “She pays me for my tooth?”

“Yup!” Liam said, and Sloane could see him calculating in his head: what was the current going rate for the Tooth Fairy? Inflation and all that . . . 

Oliver frowned. “What does she do with the teeth?”

There were a few beats of silence.

“Um,” Liam said. 

“Does she build things with them?” Oliver asked. “Like maybe she builds herself a house out of teeth?” Liam grimaced. 

“I want to live in a house of teeth,” said Flora, earnestly. “It would be so white. Also maybe pink, like a tongue! Are there tongues in the Tooth Fairy’s house?”

“Jesus, Flora,” Liam said, his face twisting.

“I *love* fairies,” Flora informed him. “Does the Tooth Fairy have beautiful wings?”

“Of course,” Liam said, grasping for safer ground. “She has beautiful wings that she uses to fly all over the world to collect teeth.”

“But how does she know when you lose one?” Oliver asked. “Can she *smell* them?”

Sloane put her hand over her mouth to stop herself laughing at Liam’s expression. She imagined a horrifying little creature with a dead-eyed, sharky face, sniffing the air for the smell of raw, bloody baby teeth. Who the hell had thought up this Tooth Fairy business in the first place? When you got right down to it, the bitch was *creepy.* 

“Time for camp!” Liam announced, overly cheerful. “Last day of camp before school starts. Are you excited?”

Both kids jumped up. “I can’t wait to show them my *hole*!” Oliver squealed, running to the door to get his shoes. Sloane stood, grabbing the kids’ plates to dump in the sink.

“Have a good day, sweetheart,” Liam said, grabbing his car keys from the counter and kissing her goodbye. “Don’t be too pissed off when the administratiton inevitably disappoints you. Do you want a bottle or wine or a box of donuts as consolation when you come home?”

“*Hey,*” Sloane protested. “Have a little faith, man.” She drained her coffee. “Donuts, please.”

Within minutes, the family was out the door and the house was silent.

The tooth lay on the plate. The last remaining bubbles of saliva popped.

Path of Spiritual Progress  
Both you and the new man must walk day by day in the  
path of spiritual progress. If you persist, remarkable things  
will happen. When we look back, we realize that the things  
which came to us when we put ourselves in God’s hands  
were better than anything we could have planned.  
\- Alcoholics Anonymous, (Working With Others) p. 100

THE GOD IDEA  
  
When we saw others solve their problems by a simple reliance upon the Spirit of the Universe, we had to stop doubting the power of God. Our ideas did not work.  But the God idea did.  
\-ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 52  
  
Like a blind man gradually being restored to sight, I slowly groped my way to the Third Step. Having realized that only a Power greater than myself could rescue me from the hopeless abyss I was in, I knew that this was a Power that I had to grasp, and that it would be my anchor in the midst of a sea of woes. Even though my faith at that time was minuscule, it was big enough to make me see that it was time for me to discard my reliance on my prideful ego and replace it with the steadying strength that could only come from a Power far greater than myself.

A.A. Thought For The Day  
  
We alcoholics were on a merry-go-round, going round and round, and we couldn’t get off. That merry-go-round is a kind of hell on earth. In A.A. I got off that merry-go-round by learning to stay sober. I pray to that Higher Power every morning to help me to keep sober. And I get the strength from that Power to do what I could never do with my own strength. I do not doubt the existence of that Power. We’re not speaking into a vacuum when we pray. That Power is there, if we will use it. Am I off the merry-go-round of drinking for good?  
  
Meditation For The Day  
  
I must remember that in spiritual matters I am only an instrument. It is not mine to decide how or when I am to act. God plans all spiritual matters. It is up to me to make myself fit to do God’s work. All that hinders my spiritual activity must be eliminated. I can depend on God for all the strength I need to overcome those faults which are blocks. I must keep myself fit, so that God can use me as a channel for His spirit.  
  
Prayer For The Day  
  
I pray that my selfishness may not hinder my progress in spiritual matters. I pray that I may be a good instrument for God to work with.

Two-Way Tolerance, p. 73  
  
“Your point of view was once mine. Fortunately, A.A. is constructed so that we need not debate the existence of God; but for best results, most of us must depend upon a Higher Power, and no right-minded A.A. would challenge your privilege to believe precisely that way.  We should all be glad that good recoveries can be made even on this limited basis.  
  
“But turnabout is fair play. If you would expect tolerance for your point of view, I am sure you would be willing to reciprocate. I try to remember that, down through the centuries, lots of brighter people than I have been found on both sides of this debate about belief. For myself, of late years, I am finding it much easier to believe that God made man, than that man made God.”  
  
Letter, 1966  
  
As Bill Sees It  
  
Breach The Walls Of Ego, p. 74  
  
People who are driven by pride of self unconsciously blind themselves to their liabilities. Newcomers of this sort scarcely need comforting.  The problem is to help them discover a chink in the walls their ego has built, through which the light of reason can shine.  
  
<< << << >> >> >>  
  
The attainment of greater humility is the foundation principle of each A.A.’s Twelve Steps. For without some degree of humility, no alcoholic can stay sober at all.  
  
Nearly all A.A.’s have found, too, that unless they develop much more of this precious quality than may be required just for sobriety, they still haven’t much chance of becoming truly happy. Without it, they cannot live to much useful purpose, or, in adversity, be able to summon the faith that can meet any emergency.

The Secret of Detachment  
Dealing with others.  
  
“Detaching with love” is what those close to alcoholics do when they realize they can’t change them. The same principle should apply to any distressing situation, but how does it work? How can I detach from people who really bother me, especially fellow workers, or perhaps a boss or customer?  
  
The secret of detachment is expressed in the biblical charge, “Resist not evil.” We don’t fight or resist the other person, or even try to change their behavior. We stop believing that the other person’s behavior can really control us in the future. We become impersonal about something that was once highly charged with resentment and bitterness. At no point, however, do we say that the others’ wrong behavior is all right, nor do we lie to ourselves about what the other is doing.  
  
Detachment does not mean that the outcome will be recovery or change for the other person. That sometimes happens, and we’re grateful when it does. If we detach in the right way, however, the outcome will always be better than anything we could bring about by fighting the situation. We have to count an outcome favorable if we stay sober and under control in the midst of an insane situation.  
  
I will detach myself from conflicts with others if they arise today. I am not going to fight anything or anybody, and I know this will bring me closer to the ideal of living at peace with everybody.

Keep It Simple

I never loved another person the way I loved myself.  
–Mae West  
  
This sums up how we used to live. We were in love with ourselves. We had to be on center stage.  
  
Our self-will ran riot. Recovery pulls us out of that world. We learn to focus on others. We learn to reach out to them with love. This is the best way to love ourselves. This doesn’t mean that we live our lives through others. It means we invite others into our lives. It also means we ask to be invited into their lives. Recovery breaks down our self-will. It makes room for others in our lives.  
  
Prayer for the Day: Higher Power, I give You my self-will. I know You’ll do better with it than me.  
  
Action for the Day: I’ll list three ways my self-will has messed up my life. How am I doing at turning over these things to my Higher Power?

Flattery is so necessary to all of us that we flatter one another just to be flattered in return.  
–Marjorie Bowen  
  
We are all deserving of unconditional love and acceptance. And all the people in our lives, past and present, deserve our unconditional love and acceptance, too. However, it’s doubtful that we either feel it all of the time from others or give it away.  
  
It’s human of us to find fault–to have expectations that are too high. But for this we pay a price. Instead of experiencing our lives serenely, contentedly, flowing with what is, we often criticize, judge, and feel generally disgruntled throughout the day. What a waste! We do have another choice, fortunately. We can let go and let God, and live and let live. Also we can recall, today and every day, that we are all special individuals in this world who are loved, fully, by our Creator.  
  
The greatest contribution we can make to the lives of others is to be affirming. We can let our spouse, children, and friends know we care about them. That we love and accept them. The love that we also long for will come back to us. We thrill at being affirmed. And we will thrill at affirming.  
  
It feels good to help another feel appreciated. Love and acceptance is my lifeline, from God around us all.

HE LIVED ONLY TO DRINK  
  
– “I had been preached to, analyzed, cursed, and counseled, but no one had ever said, ‘I identify with what’s going on with you. It happened to me and this is what I did about it.'”  
  
I genuinely believed that I was different until much later, when I had what I now know to be my first spiritual awakening: that I was an alcoholic and I didn’t have to drink! I also learned that alcoholism, as an equal opportunity illness, does not discriminate–is not restricted to race, creed, or geography. At last I was released from the bondage of my uniqueness.

Step Two – “Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.”  
  
“When we encountered A.A., the fallacy of our defiance was revealed. At no time had we asked what God’s will was for us; instead we had been telling Him what it ought to be. No man, we saw, could believe in God and defy Him, too. Belief meant reliance, not; defiance. In A.A., we saw the fruits of this belief: men and women spared from alcohol’s final catastrophe. We saw them meet and transcend their other pains and trials. We saw them calmly accept impossible situations, seeking neither to run nor to recriminate. This was not only faith; it was faith that worked under all conditions. We soon concluded that whatever price in humility we must pay, we would pay.”

Don’t others see how much I’m hurting? Can’t they see I need help? Don’t they care?  
  
The issue is not whether others see or care. The issue is whether we see and care about ourselves. Often, when we are pointing a finger at others, waiting for them to have compassion for us, its because we have not fully accepted our pain. We have not yet reached that point of caring about ourselves. We are hoping for awareness in another that we have not yet had.  
  
It is our job to have compassion for ourselves. When we do, we have taken the first step toward removing ourselves as victims. We are on the way to self-responsibility, self-care, and change.  
  
Today, I will not wait for others to see and care; I will take responsibility for being aware of my pain and problems, and caring about myself.

More Language Of Letting Go  
  
  
March 15  
  
  
Let go of the controls  
  
“You have the controls,” my flight instructor says. “No, you have the controls,” I say back. “No I don’t,” he says. “You do.”  
  
My banter with my flight instructor can be amusing at times. It’s not so funny when we fight about issues of power and control in our lives. And usually it goes the other way. We don’t want to give the controls to someone else; we want those reins ourselves.  
  
We want to get our way. And we get upset when things don’t work out. Sometimes, after we’ve been working on ourselves and our control issues for a while, we begin to get complacent. Because we’ve been so effectively using and directing our power, we rarely get in battles we can’t win. Things work out smoothly. We mostly get our way, because we’re not trying to control what we can’t. That’s when it’s easy to think we’re more powerful than we are.  
  
Are you engaged in a power struggle with someone or something you can’t change? Spend a moment thinking about it. Is that really the way you want to use your energy and power, trying to do the impossible, creating rifts, and fighting battles you can’t win? When we try to control someone else or events beyond the scope of our power, we lose.  
  
When we learn to discern the difference between what we can change and what we can’t, we usually have an easier time expressing our power in our lives. Because we’re not wasting all our energy using our power to change things we can’t, we have a lot of energy left over to live our lives.  
  
Learn to say whatever when you don’t get what you want. Learn to let things be the way they are.  
  
God, help me let go of my need to control and to be open to the flow of the universe.

Feeling a ""part of ""

""The get-togethers after our meetings are good opportunities to share things that we didn't get to discuss during the meeting.""  
  
Basic Text, p. 98  
  
Active addiction set us apart from society, isolating us. Fear was at the core of that alienation. We believed that if we let others get to know us, they would only find out how terribly flawed we were. Rejection would be only a short step away.  
  
When we come to our first NA meeting, we are usually impressed by the familiarity and friendliness we see other recovering addicts share. We, too, can quickly become a part of this fellowship, if we allow ourselves to. One way to start is by tagging along to the local coffee shop after the meeting.  
  
At these gatherings, we can let down the walls that separate us from others and discover things about ourselves and other NA members. One on one, we can sometimes disclose things that we may be reluctant to share at the group level. We learn to make small talk at many of these late-night gatherings and forge deep, strong friendships as well.  
  
With our newfound friends in NA, we no longer have to live lives of isolation. We can become a part of the greater whole, the Fellowship of Narcotics Anonymous.

The office stinks.

Not just of cheap cologne and microwaved fish, but of human rot.  
Not literal rot. Not yet.  
But the rot of time wasted. Life pissed away.  
A slow decay in a polyester shirt.

*Clack clack clack.*  
Fingers tapping keys.  
Emails about nothing.  
Meetings about meetings.  
The fluorescent lights hum, a low insectile drone that chews at my brainstem.  
I smell breath. I smell scalp grease.  
I hear sips and gulps, the wet suck of coffee-stained teeth.  
I hate them all.

I want silence.



**Day 34.**

The whispering started.  
The printer told me to do it.  
It coughed out a page.  
*Kill them.*  
A new task assigned.



**Day 40.**

I sharpen a stapler.  
I study veins like subway maps.  
I smile.  
They don’t notice.

They never do.



**Day 47.**

I begin my work.

Jared from Accounting is first.  
A hole puncher to the eyes.  
Metal fangs *clamp down, chew, pop-pop-pop.*  
His eyes turn into black, bloody holes.  
His mouth gapes, and gargles.  
I cram a whole ream of A4 inside.  
Fifty sheets deep, his throat bulges like a stuffed mailbox.

One down.



**Day 48.**

Maria. The HR lady.  
She once told me to smile more.  
I drown her in the office water cooler, her lungs filling with blue-tinted plastic cold.  
Her arms thrash, nails scrape my wrist, but...

*Bubbles. Gurgles. Stillness.*



**Day 49.**

I replace Bob’s teeth with thumbtacks.  
He screams into the conference mic.  
Everyone claps, thinking it's some weird PowerPoint bit.  
They laugh.  
I don’t.



**Day 50.**

The office is a symphony of dying.

Staplers pierce jugulars.  
Fingernails are peeled with paper clips.  
Entrails spool across the cubicle carpet like a pulled yarn thread.  
The janitor slips on the gore.  
Skull bounces off the Xerox machine.  
Blood-slick flyers shoot out  
*""TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK.""*

Their screams melt together, high and keening, like a fax machine jammed with human tongues. The walls are redecorated in arterial red. 

I stand in the breakroom, bathed in gore, panting, vibrating, feeling…

*Alive.*



**Day 51.**

I come in early.

Fresh coffee brews.  
Desks are clean.  
Colleagues sit, typing, laughing.

  
No bodies. No blood. 

It never happened.

I check my inbox. 300 unread emails.  
Weekly reports due.  
All-staff meeting at 2 PM.

A message pops up.

*FROM: The Printer*  
*SUBJECT: Begin Again.*

As a budding subminimal fanboy I must say this result hurts as I really love their Flick, nanofoamer V2 wand, milk pitcher, and really like the amount of resources they provide for their products. The owner seems nice too. 

But this is based on 3 factors:

Ease of use
-

Dreo uses a visual interface with menus for selection vs the more abstract approach of Subminimal using 3 variables

Ergonomics
-

Dreo can be used with any hand, has a wider mouth for ultra easy cleaning, built in timer to sync with shots 

vs 

Subminimal who had me looking like a clown when I realized my $160 milk foaming pitcher couldn’t pour milk without dripping on the counter and down the side. This is unacceptable. Please increase your standards and do not support this. It also is only right handed, harder to clean, and has more components to clean

Value
-

Dreo is $100 and can foam milk and general mix (protein powder, hot chocolate, etc.) vs Subminimal at $160 with only milk foaming

Oh and Dreo also has this $60 unit with supposedly the same basic function as the $100 model. Seriously can someone review [this $60 model](https://www.dreo.com/products/baristamaker-milk-frother-air?variant=45229886144674&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&dm_cam=22210266433&dm_grp=&dm_ad=&dm_kw=&dm_net=adwords&utm_source=Paid_Pmax&utm_medium=Conversion&utm_campaign=IPMS40&utm_term=%7B%7Badset.name%7D%7D&utm_content=Purchase&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwm7q-BhDRARIsACD6-fU6skZsuEJRCpiQiZ66-4cCrL2nTVwM-tyrlQXRbfKRfqRikiHu2IAaAqZTEALw_wcB)?

Target user
-

Dreo is for anyone with any level of knowledge. Unit of choice for any gift purpose. 


Subminimal is for someone wanting control over each variable, is fine with the time that takes to dial in, and is already familiar with factors that influence proper milk foaming

**More detailed review below:**
-

Ease of Use
-

Easily Dreo (with a caveat). You simply select the type of milk you’re using (dairy, oat, almond, etc.) the type of milk drink and press start. After the time (in my case 3:30), it’s done. Swirl, pour, sip, clean. The interface makes it super easy but I can see issues arising if for whatever reason your milk doesn’t work well. Do you have to use an almond milk setting but while using oat milk, do you choose cappuccino but make a latte? That can be confusing but in general it’s good. Less wasted milk product

Nanofoamer is more abstract but still fairly straightforward. Place a magnetic strip inside based on type of milk, place lid on, adjust foamer height if needed, press foam level and wait (2:30 for one temp, 3:30 for final temp). More wasted milk product if you don’t get it right initially (I didn’t) but theoretically adaptable to any milk or brand. But these variables will take time and milk to get right

Ergonomics
-

This is what motivated me to review and I’m sorry but I’m going to have to be hard on Subminimal here especially when the competition is like 60% of the cost

In what world do you design an automatic milk foamer whose pitcher **drips as you pour**??? This is even more frustrating considering their regular pitcher which I have does not have this issue. This is completely unacceptable for a $160 product  literally built for foaming and pouring milk and anyone who defends this must be lost in the sauce of coffee gear world. I have to return this just in principle. If they’re banking on everyone having a separate pitcher then that’s additional cost and cleaning to be considered which isn’t needed with Dreo

When you’re done you also have to take the lid off and awkwardly flip it upside down since the foamer is permanently attached to the lid. Not fun

Moving forward another issue is since the interface and pitcher are one unit, it only works when the handle is on the right side. I am left handed so this doesn’t work for me.  I have to use my right hand. Annoying but ok

When you place the unit on the heating stand, it plays a startup animation that you can’t fully skip. Why can we not skip this?

Most people know about the smaller inside area meaning harder to get in with your hands to clean. It’s not too bad if you have average sized hands but you must clean 3 more things - magnetic strip, the counter from drips, the side of the pitcher

Dreo is detachable and the spout is not half bad. Certainly better than Subminimal as there’s no drips. I like the timer countdown to time shots. I still have 2 complaints:

They remind you about checking for the correct tip placement *each time*. Why? It’s an extra prompt

The tip is magnetized which is cool when using the drying holder (nice touch) but dear god is it a bit difficult to put in. The magnets are like oppositely aligned so you fight the magnet to get it in and it keeps pushing to the side. This can potentially be a long term issue but I imagine muscle memory will get used to it. I found it better to grab the base rather than the tip. (This is easy now but I sometimes get an error message for some reason. Maybe it’s not fully inserted)

Value
-

Dreo wins here by a mile. 60% cheaper with additional function as a general mixer (protein powder, hot chocolate, etc). I’m not gonna test if the nanofoamer can do the same and risk messing up the fine mesh screening. Dreo also includes holders for each tip. What a nice touch

Not much else to say

Who it’s for?
-

Nanofoamer still has a space for someone who wants a dedicated milk product foamer and also wants to tinker for whatever reason. If you try different milks a lot then may god help you. It’s smaller and looks better

Dreo is what you gift someone who just wants hassle free latte quality foam. It’s quite large as a stand alone unit so the extra mixer functionality helps justify the counter space. No one needs to understand vortexes, flow rate, etc. Easy to clean and ok the reminder would probably help some people

Caveat:
-

For smaller drinks the Subminimal will have less waste cause you don’t need as much milk. I always use 180ml and it barely worked for Dreo. Any less and I’m not sure

ODE TO SPRINGTIME  
\-----------------------

A spring, a spring, a marvellous thing.  
It slinks forth from winter, a stealthy upswing,  
That follows the sleets, the hails and the snows.  
Well, sometimes it doesn't. That's just how it goes.

Hidden in plain sight, in front of your eyes,  
It blooms forth from bitterness, fed by the lies.  
Of endless long winters, without its embrace.  
Though, when snow doesn't clear, egg white goes your face.

You thought spring was coming, you just had to wait,  
But now it's not here. It was going to be great.  
Hey, why's it so cold? Wait, what's with the gale?  
The blizzard's so thick, you can't see the trail.

You wanted to sit, with a coffee, or beer,  
And watch the grass grow, or maybe the deer.  
But now there's a spiral encircling the sphere,  
Tightening daily, and fuelling your fear.

That serpentine ring, that world-twirling naught.  
It's really quite twisted, the coil that's been wrought,  
Round a fat, bug-eyed frog, sat in a pot.  
Seems that's the whole planet. That's all that we've got.

Those who know history, know it's quite plain,  
That knowin' it don't mean it won't come again.  
What's next in the race? A true summer bash?  
A real photo finish? Don't look at the flash.

Are you feeling alright? You're looking quite pallid.  
You seem quite a fright. All tossed, like a salad.  
Please take my advice, and count it a blessing.  
Like any fresh wound, you need a new dressing.

Caesar peens plowshares to arm his battalion.  
Old Ranch bought the farm, thanks to Zesty Italian.  
I might say Blue Cheese, but the Russian says no,  
And Sesame Ginger might soon join the show.

The world's Thousand Islands all share the same plate,  
As do any, who find themselves twined 'round their fate.  
I'll find one for you, though, let's settle a bet.  
I'm thinking you'd fancy a tart vinaigrette.

A well-mixed Raspberry, to blow out the lines.  
To swirl up the palate, and tickle the tines,  
Of the fork, in the road where we find ourselves sat.  
A patio door, for a gravel-blind cat.

Like everyone else, I have something to sell,  
And it might not be Heaven, but it's far off from Hell.  
Turn now from the clouds, and leave them to hover,  
By all means, please duck, and open the cover.

The face you see, the voice you hear, the body that moves—it’s all borrowed. Stolen, if we’re being honest. But don’t feel bad for them. They deserved it. Every single one of them.  

It started with a man who cut in line at the coffee shop. He barked at the barista, called her names I won’t repeat. I followed him home, watched him for days. He didn’t notice when I slipped into his life, peeled it off like a second skin. I wore him like a suit, his face stretched over mine, his voice echoing in my throat. And when I was done—when his life was in tatters, his friends gone, his job lost—I moved on.  

I’ve been so many people now, I’ve lost count. A woman who screamed at her child in the grocery store. A man who laughed at a homeless vet. A boss who crushed his employees under his heel. I take them, wear them, ruin them. And then I leave.  

But lately, something’s changed. I look in the mirror, and I don’t see them anymore. I don’t see anyone. Just a blank, empty void where a face should be.  

I’m not myself. And I’m starting to wonder if I ever was.  

And then, the phone rang. 

It was me Mummy with a new chore.

Seems Uncle Fester needed to be shown the sights and sounds of our little town.

1jbwzd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jbwzd1/hypothyroid_and_inflammatory_arthritis_tips/,Hypothyroid and inflammatory arthritis tips?,"I 29f am looking to lose 20-30 lbs. I developed hypothyroidism after my cancer treatment fried my thyroid in September (finally got normal thyroid levels in February! Went from TSH of 148 to 1.2). Because of the nature of my cancer treatment, my immune system is a mess and I’m working with inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune hepatitis as well. I take short courses of prednisone as needed for symptoms. 

I know the basics — CICO, protein, water, etc but I’m wondering if anyone has experience with both hypo and rheumatoid conditions? I feel like anytime I lose a few lbs I just gain it back when I start prednisone. Just call me Sisyphus! 

For reference, I started a desk job about 10 months before I started cancer treatment where I gained a little weight from the shift in activity, and I just want to get back to where I was before. Movement isn’t always easy when my entire body hurts at times lol. I try to do strength training a few times a week and walk a few miles a few times a week, but even that can be difficult for me unfortunately. Because my symptoms will be lifelong, I want to find ways to be successful in the midst of all the chaos my immune system is throwing at me. 

I don’t drink (2.5 years sober 🥳) and I’m not big into “drinking my calories”, which I know are two of the biggest recommendations for weight loss! Only thing I drink with calories is a protein shake with my coffee in the morning and the occasional coffee out maybe twice a month. 

Anyway, just curious if anyone else has dealt with similar complications in their weight loss journey and what’s helped! ",2,1742050823.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

Interesting how its like extreme fight or flight and hallucinations but I know this is a caffeine induced panic attack. 

Sort of enjoying it in the sense that I feel like im getting a better understanding of anxiety.
I've had maybe atleast 12 cups coffee all day

My last 2 were like tripple shots, so not sure how long this will be.

Currently 12:52am lasting about 10minutes so far.
Hands feel funny, need to keep a body part moving to avoid the feeling of full body numbness / sleep  and hallucinations

How do you guys deal with a panic attack? I've just got the tv going on and the light, and I guess my phone, and how was your first time?

UPDATE: got up walking around looking for my vape, cant find it, so grabbed a cigarette. Absolutely terrified at crossing halways to get outside, so that's interesting.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

ODE TO SPRINGTIME  
\-----------------------

A spring, a spring, a marvellous thing.  
It slinks forth from winter, a stealthy upswing,  
That follows the sleets, the hails and the snows.  
Well, sometimes it doesn't. That's just how it goes.

Hidden in plain sight, in front of your eyes,  
It blooms forth from bitterness, fed by the lies.  
Of endless long winters, without its embrace.  
Though, when snow doesn't clear, egg white goes your face.

You thought spring was coming, you just had to wait,  
But now it's not here. It was going to be great.  
Hey, why's it so cold? Wait, what's with the gale?  
The blizzard's so thick, you can't see the trail.

You wanted to sit, with a coffee, or beer,  
And watch the grass grow, or maybe the deer.  
But now there's a spiral encircling the sphere,  
Tightening daily, and fuelling your fear.

That serpentine ring, that world-twirling naught.  
It's really quite twisted, the coil that's been wrought,  
Round a fat, bug-eyed frog, sat in a pot.  
Seems that's the whole planet. That's all that we've got.

Those who know history, know it's quite plain,  
That knowin' it don't mean it won't come again.  
What's next in the race? A true summer bash?  
A real photo finish? Don't look at the flash.

Are you feeling alright? You're looking quite pallid.  
You seem quite a fright. All tossed, like a salad.  
Please take my advice, and count it a blessing.  
Like any fresh wound, you need a new dressing.

Caesar peens plowshares to arm his battalion.  
Old Ranch bought the farm, thanks to Zesty Italian.  
I might say Blue Cheese, but the Russian says no,  
And Sesame Ginger might soon join the show.

The world's Thousand Islands all share the same plate,  
As do any, who find themselves twined 'round their fate.  
I'll find one for you, though, let's settle a bet.  
I'm thinking you'd fancy a tart vinaigrette.

A well-mixed Raspberry, to blow out the lines.  
To swirl up the palate, and tickle the tines,  
Of the fork, in the road where we find ourselves sat.  
A patio door, for a gravel-blind cat.

Like everyone else, I have something to sell,  
And it might not be Heaven, but it's far off from Hell.  
Turn now from the clouds, and leave them to hover,  
By all means, please duck, and open the cover.

I have been intrigued with this #nocontact.  I have since joined multiple forums, facebook groups and spoke to many of you personally.  So I want you to know I am for you not against any one of you.  I truly believe your loving woman who are either in one of two camps.  You have been sexually abused by members of your own family.  You were severely neglected by mentally ill mother  or drug and alcholic.  You have endured things that are truly heartbreaking and my heart goes out to you.  I pray you find the healing you need.  But then there is another camp of #nocontact.  This is the camp I want to discuss.  You have suffered as everyone has as a child wounds from our parents.  You and I have created as children, what our parents should be to be good parents.  No one of us is truly good.  Are you all good?  Are you perfect and do you respond the perfect way 100% of the time?  If you do, please write a book and I will be the first one to read it.  You are in a group I have learned about that have common, human, resolvable issues, we all have.  Have I said stupid things to my children absolutely. Have I spoken when I should have remained silent, 100%.  Have I been frustrated and then a child comes to me in the middle of 5 other children wanting my attention and I spoke in a harsh tone.  Yes again.  I renounce therapist.  I will tell you why.  FIrst, I am sure all you younger woman go to them.  I have gone to 10 for mulitple issues.  Now before I let anyone speak into my life, I want to know one thing.  For if you’re a therapist your job is to heal not to harm. You are listening to one side of a story and you speak into that. I have one question I will ask my therapist, how is your relationship with your parents?  Why does it matter.  Well if you sick, do you go to another sick person in search of healing. No you do not.  You go to a healthy person.  So why go to the same level unhealthy to think she is going to make you well.  Think about that.  Also, there are no groups on Parents cutting off their kids. Why?  Because it will never happen.  Even thought you all continue to repeat and find things your parents say to fuel your false narative, its all a lie but it’s a safe lie.  You are good and your parents are bad.  But what none of these “therapist” who are only listening to you with half and ear, will not tell you is the long term consequence  I am going to share that with you and I hope my no contact gals, really think long and hard.  I have sons, and many nephews in their 20-40. They have dated tons of women. What you all don not know is they talk about the women they are dating to their families. Why?  They all have aunts and uncles who are married 30+ years. Their grandparents are married and they want what their families have.  I also have daughters and nieces of dating age and man ladies, its hard out there.  You  finally found a normal guy.  He has a good job, a home, a car, opens the car door for you and pays for your dinner.  He says what he means and does what he said he will do. He is pursuing you in the way all of you deserve to be pursued.  He makes the dinner plans and takes you to a wonderful restaurant.  You do some small chitchat about the restaurant, your week, your favorite things, etc.  Now the questions amp up a bit.  “Hey tell me about your family?  What are your parents like?”  You can either lie, which is not the way you want to start a healthy relationship or do say this.  “Well, I decided to go NO CONTACT”.   Men have no idea this is even a thing, because they love their Mamas!  “What is no contact mean?”  Well my parents never said I was smart or pretty.  They yelled at me and for my own emotional health I cut them off.  The young man looks at her, with true compassion and wants to understand her.  How can you do that?  I could never ever do that.  So you kinda renavigate and get out of the topic.  It was a nice date. He drops you off and says something like it was really nice getting to now you.  Let’s keep in touch.  Sunday morning comes and your parents are laughing and giggling as you walk into the kitchen. They are still so in love. You watched them loose a business, overcome health issues and navigate threw challenges that you know could have ended their marriage.  Your heart warms and you go for your coffee to join them.  Your Moms says “SO how did it go?!”  Now ladies, this is a normal conversation.  Well she is very pretty and super smart and funny.  It was going well until I asked about her parents.  She said she did this no contact thing.  He explains what she told him.  The father puts down the paper, looks to his wife and then to his son.  “Son this is a huge red flag and I know you know it too”.   ",0,1742050165.0,nocontact,8,0.25,False

Using a throwaway because I have identifying information on my main.

I’m 25f and in the last month I have been asked out by 3 police officers. I deal with police officers very often for work (bartending adjacent) so I’m friendly with a few of them. I’m engaged but that hasn’t stopped them from asking anyways.

I consider myself decent looking, I live in a very small city in the Midwest and do think I’m better looking than most in my area but overall I think I’d be considered average in any big cities. I get hit on frequently even though I am very vocal about having a partner.

The first time a cop pulled me over was the ONLY time he had a valid reason to perform a traffic stop. I was over the speed limit and pulled over doing everything I’m supposed to. It was an officer I’m already aquatinted with and as soon as he saw it was me he relaxed and just started a friendly conversation. I asked if he needed my license & insurance and he said “no, that’s okay. Trust me if you had a warrant I’d already know” after holding me up for about 10 minutes with polite conversation he then asked for my number and when I reminded him I’m taken he said “well that’s too bad…” before walking back to his car and letting me go.

The second time I was leaving work and got stopped maybe two blocks away. I was VERY confused as I wasn’t doing anything at all. The officer told me my headlights were too dim (I just got them replaced & it wasn’t even totally dark yet) and then he told me “I’m not going to give you a ticket for it but ma’am you are too dang pretty” and I gave the usual ‘pretend you’re funnier than you are because I’m uncomfortable’ laugh and said “my fiancé thinks so too!” after which he completely switched up his tone and let me go.

So I’m already like “this is so weird I’ve been stopped this often. Maybe my plates are flagged or something” until this morning happened.

I went into the gas station just before the highway I take to get to work. I got my usual energy drinks and checked out. There was an officer that got a coffee behind me and I smiled politely at him before leaving. I got on the highway and was like 10 miles away before I saw the flashing lights. I pull over and notice it’s highway patrol. Again I’m am so confused because I didn’t think I did anything wrong. This guy didn’t even come up with an excuse when he walked up to my car (the same cop from the gas station) and he says “I’m sorry for interrupting your morning I would just kick myself if I didn’t ask if you’re single or would be interested in a date” I told him again that I’m taken but it was sweet of him (not trying to be confrontational).

I don’t know what to do anymore. I am terrified that if I report any of them it will put a target on my back. Like I said I live in a fairly small town and I have to deal with these men & women on a regular basis. I do think this kind of thing is beyond inappropriate and an abuse of power even if they are being kind about it.

I have never received a ticket or been in trouble with the law for anything. I’m worried that if I do report them they will take it hard and I will be getting pulled over and given bs tickets or fines. There’s been a lot of shady things happen with the cops in the area. Just last year one was forced to retire because he had relations with a suspect in the back of his police car on the way to the jail. They tried to bury it but couldn’t. He’s still receiving full retirement benefits.

What do I do from here? I’m having damn near panic attacks when they go to stop me thinking I’m in real trouble. Do I consult a lawyer or is that overkill? I feel like I’m losing my mind. ",0,1742050083.0,offmychest,2,0.5,False

ODE TO SPRINGTIME  
\-----------------------

A spring, a spring, a marvellous thing.  
It slinks forth from winter, a stealthy upswing,  
That follows the sleets, the hails and the snows.  
Well, sometimes it doesn't. That's just how it goes.

Hidden in plain sight, in front of your eyes,  
It blooms forth from bitterness, fed by the lies.  
Of endless long winters, without its embrace.  
Though, when snow doesn't clear, egg white goes your face.

You thought spring was coming, you just had to wait,  
But now it's not here. It was going to be great.  
Hey, why's it so cold? Wait, what's with the gale?  
The blizzard's so thick, you can't see the trail.

You wanted to sit, with a coffee, or beer,  
And watch the grass grow, or maybe the deer.  
But now there's a spiral encircling the sphere,  
Tightening daily, and fueling your fear.

That serpentine ring, that world-twirling naught.  
It's really quite twisted, the coil that's been wrought,  
Round a fat, bug-eyed frog, sat in a pot.  
Seems that's the whole planet. That's all that we've got.

Those who know history, know it's quite plain,  
That knowin' it don't mean it won't come again.  
What's next in the race? A true summer bash?  
A real photo finish? Don't look at the flash.

Are you feeling alright? You're looking quite pallid.  
You seem quite a fright. All tossed, like a salad.  
Please take my advice, and count it a blessing.  
Like any fresh wound, you need a new dressing.

Caesar peens plowshares to arm his battalion.  
Old Ranch bought the farm, thanks to Zesty Italian.  
I might say Blue Cheese, but the Russian says no,  
And Sesame Ginger might soon join the show.

The world's Thousand Islands all share the same plate,  
As do any, who find themselves twined 'round their fate.  
I'll find one for you, though, let's settle a bet.  
I'm thinking you'd fancy a tart vinaigrette.

A well-mixed Raspberry, to blow out the lines.  
To swirl up the palate, and tickle the tines,  
Of the fork, in the road where we find ourselves sat.  
A patio door, for a gravel-blind cat.

Like everyone else, I have something to sell,  
And it might not be Heaven, but it's far off from Hell.  
Turn now from the clouds, and leave them to hover,  
By all means, please duck, and open the cover.

1jbwk9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1jbwk9t/narcissistic_mother/,Narcissistic mother,"I am a 30-year-old woman living with my family due to cultural reasons. In my culture, I cannot choose my own partner or even interact with men freely. Instead, my family is responsible for selecting a husband for me, and I have no say in the matter. Because of this, I feel completely stuck.  

One of the biggest challenges I face is my mother, who is incredibly jealous of me. She hates seeing my sister and me spending time together—whether it's playing PlayStation, having our own dinners, or enjoying coffee. She even forbids us from going out together. The same applies to my brothers; if she sees me with them watching a movie in the living room, it's an absolute no for her.  

Whenever I dress up for an occasion, she immediately starts criticizing me. She calls me ugly, says I look like a goblin, and tells me I need Botox or fillers. She mocks my height, my back, and my overall appearance, constantly bullying me.  

She also manipulates others against me. She has told my father that I’m turning my sisters against her and trying to portray her as an evil person so they will distance themselves from her. My father, unfortunately, enables her behavior. He is afraid of her and resorts to abuse—both physical and emotional—whenever we try to express our opinions. My mother insists that she is the sole authority in the house and that everyone must obey her. She refuses to solve any problems; instead, she plays the victim, drowning in self-pity and acting as if she’s alone and unloved.  

My brothers side with her completely, believing whatever she says. She paints me as a villain who is trying to take away her control, and they go along with it.

The golden child is making up stories and lies to fuel the flames and he is the older one and she absolutely loves him .

I feel trapped in this toxic environment, constantly being undermined and isolated. I don't know how to deal with this situation.  ",1,1742049643.0,family,1,1.0,False
1jbwk9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/RVLiving/comments/1jbwk9m/full_time_stationary_rv_living_vs_apartmenthouse/,"Full time, stationary RV living VS apartment/house renting","I've been parked in a camper, at a ""RV Resort"" for nearly two years.  Bought the camper, had it driven to the place of choice and it has not been moved since.  I don't think campers degenerate nearly as fast when they are used as an actual home and are stationary, as opposed to moving them around all over hell and half of Georgia every couple weeks/months. 

As far as the money is concerned, it is WAY cheaper to live in a camper.  I bought mine, brand new, for considerably less money than a new car would have cost.  Space rent is far less than the cost of an apartment; certainly far less than a mortgage.  I save approximately $150 per month on electricity, compared to my last living quarters.  Water is free, so that's another $125 per month saved.  Free WIFI is available, but is pretty shit, so I have my T-Mobile phone+internet for less per month than my internet cost alone in the previous accommodation.  

In this brand new camper, I immediately tore out the king size bed, the passthrough and storage box under it and the two ""closets"" that were above the head of the bed, since they would have each held four shirts, taking up more space than they provided.  Put my electric twin bed in the place of the bed/passthrough/storage box/closets.    I built shelves in the front curve that hold all of the things I need for computer work and/or watching TV.  I put my computer tower on the newly added shelves, 50"" monitor on top of a bookshelf loaded with books and DVDs at the foot of the bed.  Also in the bedroom, I have a four drawer dresser, a vertical stack of Yaffa Blocks, an antique clothes hamper, a corner shaped baker's rack, a camp chair that I use for my extra pillows and for the big mouse pad; under the chair are two fabric storage bins that hold off season clothing; under the bed are several more of these that have extra shoes, extra bed linen, etc.  

I discarded the dinette, the couch/sleeper and the top half of the bunkhouse.  In the kitchen/dining area, I have a vintage porcelain top table with my battery chargers, air fryer, griddle, etc. in the area previously used for the couch/sleeper.  On the side previously occupied by the dinette, I have another table and a four drawer kitchen cabinet with a three drawer storage stack on top.  I use metal baskets, designed to be hung over doors, on each upper cabinet door.  I use them for spices, packets and other small, lighter weight items that go with whatever is in that particular cabinet.  

My shower is a closet, with the addition of a second shower rod to expand the space.  Under the hanging clothes, I have four of those plastic file crates/milk crates, two stacks of two, joined by cable ties; I use them for laundry supplies, extra bath tissue, cleaning supplies, etc.  I installed a shelf that is designed to go over/behind a toilet, so as to make use of that dead space, too.  

The bunkhouse got HIP shelves to store more things, along with a baker's rack and a four drawer Sterlite ""dresser"".  The alcove under the edge of the bunk house is perfectly suited to storing the gallons of distilled water that I use in my Keurig, plus storing my flats of Body Armor and extra bottles of juice for when I run out of that in my fridge.  If/when I get a dog, that alcove will be switched over to food and water bowls, to prevent me from accidentally kicking them. 

I've never touched the propane; I don't need hot water, because I don't shower in here (the park has GREAT shower houses)  and because I have VERY few dishes to wash.  Instead, I have three sizes of paper plates and three sizes of paper bowls, plus disposable bamboo flatware.  I drop a styro cup into a mug for my coffee, then dispose of that. 

I use two space heaters in the winter and they do an amazing job of keeping me warm; even when it is 12 degrees outside, the interior temp has never dropped below 60 degrees, which is, for me, comfortable with a sweater or a set of fuzzy pajamas and some cabin socks.  

I've never used the shower for the obvious reason stated earlier.  I've never used the hand sink just outside of the bathroom; turning the faucet toward the wall and covering the sink with a rigid, slatted bath mat, it now holds my Keurig with two pod storage drawers underneath the machine, all this below the mirrored medicine cabinet on the wall above the hand sink.  

I don't use the overhead lights because they are far too bright; I use fairy lights instead and they keep the light level non-blinding, plus I can change their colors, should I wish to.   One string attached around and behind the 50"", one string woven through the bedside shelves, one string in the bunkhouse, one on top of the medicine cabinet above/behind the Keurig, one in the shower/closet, reflecting off the white shower walls.

I can go swim in the pool, fitness walk through the park or use the exercise room, I can do my laundry in the provided machines in the main building, use my outdoor tables, benches and so forth to sit outside when I want to, ride my bike around if I want.  I save about $400 per month as compared to my previous lodging, while knowing that this space is MINE and I don't have to worry that my landlord is selling my building and leaving me to swing in the wind.  I do very well living alone, but there is community, should you wish to avail yourself of it in this lifestyle, because we all made the choice to live this way. ",3,1742049643.0,RVLiving,3,0.72,False

[Chapter 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jbwn9j/a_van_polan_story_zark_van_polan_and_the/)

**Quick word: I have re-read the chapter 3 times to figure out if the writing style changes a little bit in this chapter.**  
**I have not found the force, if you notice, can you please inform me about it.**

**Chapter 16: The Spirit Jacqueline Hernandez And The Pet**

She looked at the wall while one of the trainees had his palm pointed towards it.

“Ugh, Come on, Bertil! Squeeze in your asscheeks, and fire.” She told him in an annoying teenage voice.

“I am trying, Jacqueline. Why are you so demanding? Your organization contacted me and explained that I had powers. It is not my fault I can not get anything out of me.” Bertil tried explaining.

“Ugh! Why am I stuck with new Trainees as punishment? It is unfair that Greta was re-assigned after the last failed assignment.” Jacqueline uttered to herself.

Bertil kept making weird movements like he was trying to shoot toward the wall, and for a moment, a little bit of ash in a light blue color came out from his palm, which was the size of a drop of water. Jacqueline followed it as it slowly swayed to the ground and disappeared in smoke. She looked at Bertil, surprised he couldn't get any energy on his first day. Weirdly, he was sweating a lot and must have used up a lot of energy to make that puny shot. A little bit worried about his intense sweating and shaky moves he was doing she needed to check if everything was alright with him.

“Uh, you are sweating a lot, Bertil. Are you alright?” She asked.

He turned his head to the left towards her with a distraught look and responded:

“I think I popped in my pants; something big is covering my cheeks.”

She bent to the right to check behind him and noticed his cheeks were not balanced. Luckily, she couldn’t feel the smell at all.

When she quickly glared to the right, she saw her pet behind a container, gesturing with both claws in the air, signaling her to come to it.

“Maybe you should rest today, go home, and fix your…problem in your pants, Bertil!” She tried explaining that the training was over.

He walked away from the road, looking down at the ground, a little bit depressed about pooping his pants.

When the coast was clear, her pet came running to her and jumped up in her arms, looking satisfied to be reunited with her again. Both were smiling like they had been away from each other for a long time, but in reality, it had only been a couple of hours.

“Sjev Sjev!, Se, Sjev Sjeeeeev sjev!” It uttered Jacqueline, who was surprised.

“Are you sure, Kutt?”

“Sjev,” Kutt answered in a nodding matter.

“So, if we try to get on the mission, we can maybe find the Hunting Spear Of Destruction. Are you sure the spear is in Hell?” She asked.

Kutt nodded, smiling with her sharp teeth.

“Sjev sjev sjev?” Kutt Asked.

“We must try to sneak in on the assignment and go there with the investigator. He is a human, so he is weak. We are strong enough to protect humans and then try to find the spears. It can not be that hard, right Kutt?”

“Sjuuuuuuv!” Kutt roared out in the air in happiness.

 

“We are here now, Mr Zark!” The woman in the front seat said, noticing that Zark had fallen asleep during the one-hour drive back to the office.

He scratched his head and, yawning, gave the Witch a cold look before opening the door and stepping out. He noticed several Witches lined up in one line opposite each other, their heads bowing down to the ground. He opened the door and saw an older lady passing by him in a hurry. Zark slowly went in and noticed the Witches still having their heads bowed to the floor without any sound. When the door behind him closed, a wind blew through him from behind, and he quickly turned around, wondering how the closing of the door could cause that kind of wind when it was good weather outside. He walked between the lines of the still, quiet Witches, and one green-haired one was crying. He scratched his head as he slowly moved toward the elevator, and the Witches started commenting.

“Good luck, Mr. Zark! Please save the organization!” A black-haired Witched commented.

“So many Witches have died for the cause. Please be careful!” Another one with blue hair commented.

“Please save the baby, Mr Zark!” A yellow-haired one commented.

Zark thought the whole situation was weird because it is usually just a Hi or Hello when coming to the office.

When the doors to the elevator opened up, the green-haired one yelled out:

“YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE OF THE THREE!”

He stared at them with a surprised look when the strong wind he had felt earlier swooshed right through him. He pressed the button that said ten, and exactly when the door shut, he quickly turned around and hit with a right hook behind him. As he hit the mirror, he noticed a head temporarily showing itself before disappearing, and in the tight space, he tried to do a high kick with his left leg when a yellow light stopped the kick midair, and the invincible figure screamed out in the air:

“JACQ…YUK…IT!”

He noticed another yellow light coming towards him from beneath, and he tried to bend his head backward quickly, but he had no chance with the lightning speed. It hit the jaw as he flew up with full force on the ceiling and fell on the figure as it showed itself looking like a teenage girl. He quickly tried elbowing her head with several blows as she protected herself with her hands, and he managed to get one clean hit on her right cheek when she made a mistake and turned her head a little bit. A light shone behind him as she taped both her feet together, and both of them flew up into the ceiling, with Zark taking the hit while his body protected her, and both fell on the ground. She quickly got up and circled him to keep her distance as he slowly got up near the door with blood-soaked hair. He spit blood on the floor and tried catching his breath as he asked her:

“Who are you?”

The elevator sounded as the doors slowly opened, and the girl's right leg switched to a darker yellow light. He tried attacking her but to no avail. As time and space had stopped for Zark, he saw her jump in the air and tried to follow the movement, but he was going in slow-motion as she kicked him right on the chest as he flew out from the elevator and slid onto the floor with Veronica and Abella in chock on what was going on.

“My name is Jacqueline Hernandez!” She answered Zark's question earlier as he was not moving on the ground.

Suddenly, a long red whip got pushed out from Zark's right hand, which was long and burning in red fire.

“GET DOWN!” Veronica yelled out in the air as a red aura gushed from Zarks body. He slowly got up from the ground when Jacqueline entered the hallway.

“Have you not had enough old man!” She told him.

Zark swung his right arm backward as the whip burned through the wall, crashing the outer windows and going through Victoria's office with the blue shield deactivating as the whip, after 180 degrees, hit the ceiling, making a deep line and going through the window. Zark then pushed his arm with a quick move forward, with Abella quickly kicking her assistant toward Victoria so they hit the coffee table. She quickly rolled to the right as the whip burned through the floor before it went up when Abella chanted quickly:

“Sa na fa pru tan” hit her palm with full force on the floor, and everyone froze.

Abella got up from the ground, as did Victoria, but the assistant froze as she was too weak to handle the immense power of the spell. Jacqueline was in midair with a dropkick coming towards Zarks head as she had grabbed the whip midair, which surprised Abella. Victoria moved closer to Jacqueline as she noticed she was still moving slowly on the frozen spell, which would typically not be possible. She saw something grey sticking out, and she quickly yelled to Abella:

“IT’S A SPENX DRAGON! TAKE COVER!” Victoria yelled to Abella, who tried distancing herself.

An enormous explosion was heard from the 10^(Th) floor as smoke covered the air, and the Witches down on the ground outside of the building stared up on the building in shock.

Several Witches moved quickly up to the 10^(Th) floor as the smoke covered the whole floor.

“Look for survivors.” The Pink-haired Witch ordered the others, who were driving Zark, to the office.

They scattered into the smoke as one of them returned quickly, with Victoria supporting herself on her shoulders. Abella came right after as the smoke started to clear the area because of the broken Windows.

“I FOUND ZARK! HE STILL HAS A PULSE BUT IS UNCONSCIOUS.” Someone yelled out.

Veronica chose to stay to see if Jacqueline appeared when the smoke slowly vanished in the area, but she was gone. Besides Zark, the Spenx was in a foster position and was not moving. A Witch quickly hurried, picked it up, and ran towards the nursery in the building.

“GIVE IT A BREATHING TUBE AND PUT SOME LETTUCE BESIDE IT. UPDATE ME EVERY FIVE MINUTES OF THE STATUS!” Veronica screamed to the Witch in the corridor, who had Kutt in her arms.

“Where is the girl?” Abella asked out in the air, shocked by everything that had happened.

“This was the first time I had seen a Spenx. I had only read about them because there was little information about them in Valiant. A scarce breed, the explosion that happened was not the girl. It was the dragon who did the explosion in self-defense. The reason why Jacqueline is gone, from what I found, is that the girl is the shell only. The Spenx holds a part of the girl's soul in protection. There is no information about these creatures because they often walk around invisible to everyone. They walk by the side of their host. The books say that if the Spenx dies, the soul it carries gets destroyed, even if it only holds a part of it. That is why there is barely much information about it. If a Spenx would sacrifice itself with a soul inside it and would do an explosion to die, it would have killed all of us in the one-kilometer distance, turning everyone to ash. A Spenx is the weakest dragon ever, but it can walk in dark areas, only areas Death itself walks.” Veronica said as everyone went quiet.

Abella and Veronica looked at each other, knowing they were in a complicated situation.",1,1742049626.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

**Session Zero**

Hold your session zero, do what you normally do. During my session zero, I have all players run the ""Before the Storm"" on DND Beyond.

https://www.dndbeyond.com/begin/en

**I highly recommend doing this 1 on 1**. 

Watch their decision and let them know, the location is not Neverwinter but Port Llhast. If you're planning on running a longer campaign, into LMoP and the players have a full lore/backstory - this still applies, this could have been their current lifestyle the last 2-3 months since arriving in Port Llhast. Make any adjustments needed to make sense for the players.



This quick little adventure only contains 5 classes, how I handle this is easy

* **Fighter:** Fighter, Barbarian, Ranger, Monk
* **Cleric:** Cleric, Druid, Bard
* **Wizard:** Wizard, Warlock, Sorcerer
* **Paladin:** Paladin, Druid
* **Rogue:** Rogue, Ranger, Barbarian, Bard, Monk


**Assigning Player's Quest**

There are some specific quests that needs to be assigned and it's easier going with the flow of ""before the storm"".

**Cleric, Druid, Bard**

Ideally prioritize this specific quest to a Cleric if you have few people under this flag.
We will play with the dream they had during ""Before the storm"" and keeping it almost RAW in the Dragons of Stormwreck Isle book.

They are looking for curse item that is normally found in the Compass Rose and cleanse it. 

**Wizard, Warlock, Sorcerer**

Assign someone who will take this quest that started in ""Before the Storm"". Following up on the lead after their friend passing, this individual needs to unlock the history/lore of Stormwreck Isle and the King Killer Star, which will fold into the Ritual of Sparkrender.

**Fighter, Barbarian, Ranger, Monk**

After their friends surprised the player, they set sail to Stormwreck isle for an adventure. Not knowing what to expect - Encourage them to take the lead and be the Hero that they are. No actual personal quest is needed. 

**Paladin, Druid**

Prioritize the Paladin for this specific quest if there is one in the group.
Following up on ""Before the Storm"", they are disappointed and lost with the corruption going on in Port Llhast. Opportunity found them however. 

After resigning, The Paladin (or Druid) goes to a temple or church. Host a 1 on 1 Roleplay with the player. You are the Priest or someone with an important title. Father, Rabi, High Archduke, a humble but well respected priest or someone of respectable title and wisdom. 
Convince the paladin and encourage to have faith and follow your heart. Send them off to Stormwreck Isle per ""Before the Storm"". 
As they leave the temple/church they see a family weeping and praying. The priest will tell the paladin the story about her daughter (**named Aleitha**) has set off on the Compass Rose and never returned. She went to find her Fiancé; missing her husband and that was the last thing they heard. All they want is closure. They show up every day for the last X months/year

Upon leaving the church, a flier smacks him in the face, he reads it:
Wanted, 500 gold - Tarak the poisoner

This quest is to question the paladin decisions and understand, sometimes it's okay to look the other way for the greater good (hopefully).

This quest also crosses into Cleric quest. Once the cleric cleanses the evil talisman from Aleitha, the paladin can return to the church and hand over Aleitha lock of hair as proof and provide closure to the family who weeps everyday at the church.

**Rogue, Ranger, Barbarian, Bard, Monk**

Following up from ""Before the Storm"", they also learn he has a bounty on his head. 500 gold. 500 gold is no joke and is usually assigned to some serious serious people. Who did he poison and kill? I have it as, Tarak got setup and his guild used his poison to commit mass murders. Tarak is the scapegoat of this story. 

I wanted to create a little friction with the rogue and paladin, do they turn him in or not. everything else as written in the book. He doesn't have any gold and explains his story. He still feels guilty and has chosen to stay in Stormwreck Isle as his own punishment and repentance. He has become a big assistance to everyone there for his amazing work. Make it very hard for the players to turn him in for 500g. 

-------------------------------------------------------


**The Adventure Begins, Set Sail!**

FIRST AND FORMOST - SKIP THE NORMAL PLAYER INTRODUCTION. They do not meet at a tavern or anything like that. We will trauma bond, see below!

Now I am using some of Mathew Perkins for the Boat Ride and Skill challenge. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm7cyABEOP4

**Some Lore**

There is 2 boats and 2 captains. The first Boat is called the ""Barque"" which is a massive, massive, **MASSIVE** Merchant ship that can also hull a ""medium size"" Boat on the side called the ""Cutter"".

The Barque has well over 200 sailors. The Name of the captain is up to you.
The Cutter is owned by Drauz, can hold up to 80 people. The boat is designed to ""cut through"" any waves with it's superior steering, that can overcome the erratic waves of Stormwreck isle. 

It takes 3 days from Port Llast to Stormwreck Isle. So tell a story for the first 2 mundane days. I have all the players still separated from each and only meet at lunch time. On the first night, after a grueling 12 hour shift, dinner bell sets off. 10 tables of 8 and 9 of them are filled. They see Drauz sitting on the last table that says ""Guest"". Have each player roll a d100, introduce them in order, name and description only. 

After each player introduces themselves, Sildar Hallwinter (From Lost Mine of Phandelver) joins the table. Players will learn it was Sildar, or actually his employer who has hired and convince Drauz to set sail to Stormwreck Isle. 
Sildar is here to find 2 people, Gwyn Oresong for Gundren and maybe his friend Iarno Albrek.

Allow the players to ask 2-3 questions before both NPC have to leave / finished eating. Keep things unknown to the players and separate them once again. 

------

*Sildar then says ""Then let us make a quick prayer and toast""*
*Sildar raises his mug and says ""To Helm""*
*Capt Drauz interjects ""and To Umberlee.""*
*Sildar says ""And to Umberlee. Keep our path in your unfettered gaze, Lord Helm. I shall not err if you are watching.""*

*Then you all finish your meal and went back to your own beds to go to sleep.*

*The next day was just a long, boring 14 hours of work with lunch and dinner. All of you have yet to work above and have spent all of your time since boarding below side. Only when you are done with work, do you get to see the night, the gorgeous Moon of Selune followed by the tears of Selune (a bunch of asteroids that pretty much follow it).*

*Now, the following day, It is the day you will arrive at Stormwreck Isle. It is high noon as you begin your work shift. It is the first time you get to enjoy the beautiful scenery as your tasks has you working outside for the first time. 8 hours later, the sun begins to set and Dinner has been called. You are informed to get ready. In 2 hours the Barque should make visual contact with the island and that would be the cue to set sail on The Cutter and break away from the Barque.*

*Each of you after dinner decided to take one final look of the sea and move to the top side.*

Then i used Perkin, verbatim introduction and into a Skill check Challenge. 
I have created 10 challenges, 2 for each players. I run 5 players personally.

There is a loot associated with how many successful challenge is completed.

* 5/10 = case of 10 potions
* 6/10 = potion of water breathing + Case
* 7/10 = potion of water breathing + Case
* 8/10 = Cap of Water Breathing + 1 potion of water breathing + Case
* 9/10 = Cap of Water Breathing + 2x potion of water breathing + Case
* 10/10 = Necklace of Adaptation + Cap + 2x Potion of water breathing + Case

**There is one challenge that test one of the players to see if they fall overboard or not. If they do, 2 things happens**

1) They automatically get diseased - Dysentery which, for the next 24 hours, everytime they use an action, they must roll on a D100 first, on a 1-10, their action is cancelled and they feel like they are going to shit in their pants. On a 1, they shat themself.

2)  If the player was thrown overboard, they will start at a disadvantage location in the beach, in the water. 

After the Skill Challenge, the captain of the Barque will reward them accordingly. Hopefully 10 potions of healing, cause I do not pull punches for lvl 1 combat, especially when diseases and poisons are in play. I'm not trying to TPK them but I am creating threatening environment. 

-------------------------------------------------------

**Crash at the beach**

We start off with another cutscene where a Harpy/Mermaid/Siren messed with everyone on the Cutter, leading them to a crash at the beach. 


NPC Lists - Main Fight:

* 1 Crimson Shambler (applies disease)
* 1 Garroter Crab
* 1 Bone Crap (applies disease)
* 2 Giant Crab

NPC List - Threatening but can be avoidable. They will not touch land, will try to fight in water, if not retreat if players are on land. 

* 2 Kuo-Toa with Nets only
* 1 **Blue** Gring
* 1 **Orange** Grung

NPC List - Not Combative but Lurking

* Giant Shark

Once the Cutter crashes into the land, everyone is overboard and tossed about. I usually have keep 2 players close to each other, another 2 close to each other but 2 turns away from the other pair. And the person who got overboarded on the Barque pretty far away in the water, in danger. If they did not failed the skill challenge, then when the cutter crashed, have everyone roll a D100 - the loser gets put in the deep end.

Now mind you, there is also 80 sailors in the ocean, swining to the beach as well. Screams of Horror and death can be heard, including a Giant Shark. Let the PC know how dangerous and OP this shark is! (125hp, CR 5 is a TPKing Shark). So the loser better beeline to the beach ASAP! Not only that, the 2 Koa and 2 Grung are just 2 rounds away from catching that player too! Everyone needs to kinda jump in the water to save him. 

Once they defeated everything, is when the Crimson Shambler appears. It will explode on death, inflicting disease potentially.

-------------------------------------------------------

**Meet the 7 Kobolds!**

If the players are on the verge of a TPK - the kobolds can make the save. If not, The Kobolds appear after defeating the Crimson Shambler. Please give each kobold a personality.  I wanted to make 7 cause Day 1 and Day 2, the players gets to pick 1 to travel with. At the end of this Module and going into Lost Mine, I want the players to adopt one to join them. So make them memorable if you plan to continue afterward.

The kobolds will take them to Dragon's Rest

-------------------------------------------------------

**Welcome to Dragon's Rest**

Runara - I kept her secret hidden until the very end of the module, when Sparkrender is defeated. Try not to hint the PC she is a Ancient Brass Dragon.

NEW NPC:

Gwyn Oresong - She is from the module: Shattered Obelisk and a friend of Gundren Rockseeker. The Reason Sildar is on boat is because of 2 things. Sildar is seeking info on his friend Iarno Albrek and a favor for Gundren to bring Gwyn back to the mainland. She's been stranded there but had no rush to return. However she forgot she was also suppose to assist Gundren. She's been busy with research in Stormwreck Isle.

Gywn Backstory in Stormwreck isle is very Important.

**New Stormwreck Isle LORE**

We know about the red dragon that died by the 3 metallic dragons. Then we know Runara defeated Sparkrender grand father centuries ago. So, when Sparkrender arrived a year or 2 ago, he came in with a purpose. 

Sparkrender Father never made his way to Stormwreck Isle, However his father has a horde of loot. Within that horde, was a book that Sparkrender found. **The Tome of Dragons** which was once in possession of his grandfather who kept notes in it. His grandfather was an ally of Sammaster - https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sammaster

Gwyn Oresong originally came to Stormwreck Isle to study the ecosystem and how old dragons' blood affects everything. Her research was meant to be 2-3 months, however being stranded, she has now been in the island for 8-9 months. For the remaining 6-7 months, she met Sparkrender under a fake name who fed her info. With this fake name, he also mentioned to her about his grandfather and dropped his real name to her. 

Sparkrender wanted to learn more about the 4 ancient dragons that died in the island. The red dragon and the metallic dragons. She did the research for him. He then fed her some info about the King Killer Star, she was intrigued and learned as much as she could, since she had access to Runara Library. This allowed Sparkrender to understand his grandfather notes. His grandfather has experience the Dracorage and learned the star from Sammaster himself. He attempted a ritual but failed by Runara at the time. Sparky intends to finish it. 

Thus Gywn has a lot of knowledge on King Killer star. https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/King-Killer_Star

When the heroes arrive in the island, in 3 days time - the Star will be at the closest point to Toril. That is when Spark does his ritual. 

I also give some lore and history lesson on Tears of Selune: https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tears_of_Sel%C3%BBne

Since it is connected to the King Killer Star. 

All this information should be given to the wizard if the wizard ever speaks to Gwyn in Dragon's Rest. She will always be out at night, with a telescope, looking at the cluster, hoping to get a glimpse of the Red star hiding in the cluster. 

Runara will deny access to the Observatory until the 3rd day. She will inform the PC, exiled Dragons lives there and are dangerous. She wants no harm to them nor harm to the players. 

-------------------------------------------------------

**Day 1**

Runara has spoken to Sildar and Drauz and informed them, that many sailors and potentially PC may have a horrible disease. If anyone failed the Crimson Shambler explosion, they will die in 7 days. There is no cure in the island. They must make it back to Port Llhast in 7 days or perma die. They have tried Lesser Restoration in the past and it did not work. This is where they will also learn, many of the recently dead Sailors are now crimson shamblers.

Regardless a plan was made - The players, with a kobold of their choosing will go ahead toward Compass Rose. A boat they believe, can be deconstructed and used for parts to repair the Cutter, that didn't take tooo much of a beating. 
Drauz and his 30 of his crew will go back to the beach, put their friends to rest and moor their boat properly, so repairs can be made. The other 40 sailors are non combative, will be following shortly behind the players to break the compass rose down. 

TIME IS IMPORTANT - they need to repair the boat and set sail on the 3rd night, to arrive to Port Llast in time. Sailing takes 3 days. Thus the Compass Rose is the first objective.

2 Battle Maps:

* En Route To Compass Rose Map
* Compass Rose

-------------------------------------------------------

**En Route To Compass Rose Map**

So I added a battle map here: https://content.encounterkit.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1920,quality=75,format=auto/https://content.encounterkit.com/map/preview/efee5aedba7598be5adadab83d42107c.webp

NPC List:

* 4 Zombie Cavefish, 2 pairs each, separated 
* 2 crimson Shamblers - each isolated by themselves
* 1 Cackling Skeleton
* 1 Aboleith, nihilethic zombie 

The players has a choice to make - skip this map and fight just the nihilethic zombie OR
through a series of rock jumping, wave dodging or swimming, reach the other side and open a visible treasure chest they spotted when arriving on the map. Thus leading to lots of danger and the Cleric/Paladin Personal Quests.

From the Module, Compass Rose - I moved the Tarkash letter into this chest. 

if they players decides to fight, When defeating 2 of the Cavefish, the zombies will once again rise, together and move together to the beach before collapsing. As their final strength and will, they will embrace each hug before dying. This will symbolize the daughter and her fiance. 

The Cackling Skeleton will be protrayed by the Captain of the Compass Rose, and the Abolieth is of Orcus doing. 

Lots of diseases here!

-------------------------------

**Cackle Fever**

When exposed to Cackle Fever, players must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution Throw, on a failed save the effects of the disease manifest when they arrive at Seagrow Cave. An infected player gains one level of exhaustion that cannot be removed until the disease has been cured.

In addition, players with Cackle Fever must make a DC 12 Constitution Saving Throw anytime they experience stress (such as entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, having a nightmare, entering a dangerous area, etc.). On a failed save, the player takes 1d6 psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute.

The player may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn each round of combat to try to end the effect early. Any player that starts his/her turn within 10 feet of the laughing player must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution Saving Throw or become infected themselves.

Once a player succeeds on a saving throw against that individual’s laughter, he/she becomes immune to that individual’s laughter for 24 hours.

(If more than one member of the party is infected, the player is not immune to the other players mad laugh, but only the one he/she succeeded against.)

**Cures for Cackle Fever**

At the end of each long rest, the infected player must make a Constitution Saving Throw (DC 13), on a save, the DC saving throw for the mad laughter is reduced by 1d6. The disease is cured when the DC drops to 0. After three failed saves, the player gains 1 indefinite madness trait from the chart below, this effect becomes a permanent character flaw.

Cackle Fever can also be cured with a Greater Restoration spell or a Paladin’s Lay on of Hands ability. Cure Wounds and Healing Word have no effect.

-------------------------------

**Nihilestic Rot**

The target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. After 1 minute, the diseased creature’s skin becomes translucent and slimy. The creature cannot regain hit points unless it is at least partially underwater, and the disease can only be removed by heal or comparable magic. Unless the creature is either fully submerged or frequently doused with water, it takes 1 acid damage every 1 hour. If a creature dies while diseased, it rises as a nihilethic zombie. 

To Cure this, a cleric, paladin, druid must perform a Ceremony spell which contains Consecration. Allow Paladins/Druids to learn the Ceremony spell. 

Cleanse the talisman then create holy water that they must drink. If they need material components, they have it. Or you can hand wave it. 

Allow the players to think and solve this, if they have no solution, then give the cleric the answer, they would 100000% know ceremony has Consecration, which cleanses the talisman and potentially holy water can cure the inflicted.

-------------------------------

**Moor Plague**

An unpleasant illness caused by scratches and cuts in foul swamps, this illness slowly turns the victim's skin green; additionally, the victim begins to emit the most unpleasant stench. Victims are Slowed while suffering this disease.

They are always last in the initiative roll. 

Cure: On a Long rest, DC Con Saving throw of 10 to remove it.

-------------------------------

**Dungeon masters - some notes**

If they players are doing bad, the kobold can assist. If they are looking pretty beat up after wards and after some short rest, low on healing supplies - maybe, one of the sailors has potions or - add some to the chest. 

Now what in the chest? beside Tarkash letter, explaining what happened, there is some important loot. - Add what you want, I also added a special d12 dice roll

* 1) Armor of Gleaming
* 2) Bottle of Endless Coffee
* 3) Tankard of Plenty
* 4) Breathing Bubble*
* 5) Cloak of Many Fashion
* 6) Orb of Direction
* 7) Perfume of Bewitching
* 8) Potion of Watchful Rest
* 9) Prosthetic Leg
* 10) Thermal Cube*
* 11) Veteran's Cane
* 12) Potion of Healing x5

-------------------------------

**Compass Rose**

NPC List:

* 1 Lindwurm

Notables changes - All the loot in this entire map is located in 1 chest only. One massive loot pile. The problem is, guarded by a Lindwurm.

They can avoid fighting the lindwurm, secure the location for the sailors to deconstruct the boat and fight some simple harpies if you really want. If not, if they decide to get the chest, it's going to be a underwater fight. Hopefully some of them have ways to breathe underwater, or Lure the lindwurm into the boat 2nd floor or top deck. 

You may have to fudge or play around Lindwurm HP and change Lindwurm damage output to something reasonable. I kept the 136 hp, but all his attacks are a +2 and a 1d4+2.
The point for this fight is the Lindwurm Fever - try to spread that around if players don't have more than 2 exhaustion points out of 10.

-------------------------------

**Day 2 - Seagrow Cave**

2 battle maps:

first battle map is a simple battle map, that forces players to climb down a cliff side, bit of a skill challenge and 3-4 flying snakes. Careful not to kill your players - flying snakes are no joke. They only attack once the players are trying to climb down. Attack with disadvantage, if they r trying to fight back, or move asap to land to fight them properly. 

**Seagrow Cave**

Alright - this got changed. So first off, why are they coming here. They finally met Tarak, and many sailors and PC are probably sick by now. If anyone got affected by the very first Shambler, they are feeling it now. So there are some cures, however Tarak can't make any due to the Mushroom people kinda locked him out of the cave with a ghastly octupus. They need to get inside the cave, secure the ingredients to make all sorts of cure and not kill the mushroom people. Figure out why they became hostile to Tarak or why they went radio silence with Tarak. 

NPC Lists: Combative

* Spore Servant Octupus
* 5 Octupus tentacles with 20hp each
* Hongaek

The octopus is revamped in my campaign. See Stats block: https://i.imgur.com/va2gL5z.png

This octopus is a Giant, taking 3x3 and near the entrance of the cave. When combat start, his tentacles should be 20 feet away from the octopus. ---> https://imgur.com/j5XUe65

Hopefully the players are inside and ""trapped"". As you can see in the stats blocks, 
he has 4 tentacle grapple before he slams them all who failed the grapple. The main point of this simle fight is - upon death, he too will explode like the crimson shambler and infect anyone not diseased yet. I did forget to add that in the stat block.

The players do not know the Octopus has low HP. Let the players know, each tentacles can be attacked. 
teeheeeheee

Now the mushroom people might interact with the players, without speaking, will try to point, drag, wave to them to jump into the hot spring. If the players short rest, bathe in the spring for 30 minutes- they recover full HP. 

**Hongaek**

Now everything I've created in terms of poison and diseases leads to this fight. 
Nerf his attacks to 2d8 instead of 4d8. Should be a slow painful fight. Hong has advantage, they got disadvantage, he has resistance to pretty much everything - it's a battle of attrition. 

Afterwards - mushroom people cheer, bathe in pool to recover hp and allows them to grab whatever ingredients in the cave. You can be a dick and add some more surprise monsters such as piercers, grimmlets, pixie umbrellas, vine brights, cavelight moss, boomer while exploring the cave and picking ingredients up. They can always heal back up to full hp. 

-------------------------------

**Returned to Dragon's Rest**

The herbalist is hard at work to make antidotes for everyone. Will be ready tomorrow morning. 
If no-one has interacted with Gywn yet, she will initiate a conversation and drop the full lore before sleep.

**Day 3**

The kobolds took off for their own adventure and will return shortly. Gywn is observing the sky with her telescope. She goes back to talking to the group, while her eyeball are glued to the telescope. She will then name drop the dragon who assisted her several months ago. Runara is nearby and over hears this little bit of conversation and interrupts. She does not know of that name, and she knows EVERYONE in the island. She will ask for more info about this so called person. Gwyn will inform what this dragon asked for, will name drop his grandfather name too. Runara will ask of a description and learns this is Sparkrender. Runara is putting everything together now, 1+1, learning Spark is the grandson of the last dragon she killed, because of a ritual he attempted to do.

This whole time, she has been brushing off the King Killer star, it's a rumor/... a theory. But now... gwyn looks back into the telescope and yells in excitement, I can see the red glow!

Noises can be heard in the kitchen, a random kobold is suffering from a headache. Go investigate. Few new kobolds, more bigger and tougher looking comes barging in, huffing and puffing, trying to withstand the headache that is increasing in pain and spills the beans to Runara. Sparkrender doing something funny and weird. He has Aidron too. Other kobolds gone mad and began attacking, he killed them all. We escaped.

People are now heard screaming in Dragon's Rest. Runara hands them the key, gives them permission to go to the observatory ASAP. Gwyn can escort them there. She will handle the chaos that is about to break in Dragon's Rest.

Gwyn realizes now, everyone life is in danger - she didnt think not once, she is in an island filled with all sorts of dragon-kins and if they all go mad, she and everyone else will die. Runara will mention, Fake name dragon is Sparkrender and he is performing a forbidden ritual, taking the powers of the 5 ancient dragons for himself and become god like Timat and Bahamut. He must be stopped now!

-------------------------------

**Observatory**

if you want to an add a battlemap before observatory, feel free. I have them fight some giant frog, grungs, before 2 kobold dragonshield attacks to use up some resource. 

Unlike the book, you can see the 5 statues, Aidron in the center, tied down and screaming in pain while Sparkrender performing the ritual. You can also see a giant observatory telescope reverse engineered and is pulling the red star into a red beam, directly into Aidron. 

I am using a modified Wyvern stat blocks for Sparkrender ----> https://i.imgur.com/62gGYJi.png

**Sparkrender Defeated**

Once you kicked his ass, he does not die. A Cutscene ensues, the players see's a giant Brass Dragon fly in and gets in between both groups. Sparkrender will jump behind his ritual circle. The players will move to the opposite side. Runara will land inside the circle, above Aidron. She will destroy the telescope.

Sparkrender, in his final act, will take a breathe attack and hit runara. In doing so, he will yell out her name and accuse her of killing his grandfather. This will be the reveal to the players. He manages to make her bleed and attempts to rush at her before collapsing. She saves Aidron, destroys the statue and transform into her human form, thanking the players.

-------------------------------

**Alternative Ending**

When Sparkrender collapsing, he falls inside the circle too. We now have 6 ancient dragons and their essence & blood inside the circle now + Aidron and Sparkrender. The island begins to shake, Prismatic  large gysers explodes everywhere.
Runara calls to the group to run to her. She will shield the players but everything around them is exploding. Runara screams in agony as well, everyone is feeling intense heat as the prismatic beams now going all over the place. Fade to black, the party goes unconscious.

The party wakes up..... in a place unknown to them.... in a room that looks unnatural. Their hands.... OMFG the players hands... they are.... different! it's..... scaley....

The players are now kobolds or Dragonborns - your call DM.

They have awaken inside a space ship....

**LORE TIME**

If you look up https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tears_of_Sel%C3%BBne

you will see there are many places in the cluster. And we know the lore of Stormwreck isle is, many dragons has been attracted to the island for centuries. Even from out of space. Many dragons has died in Stormwreck Isle.

The players has absorbed the consciousness of 5 dragonborns that came to warn Toril Dragon's of eminent danger. That a Mythral was created and weaponized a Star to destroy all dragons in the universe. However - dragons in Toril are ruthless and murdered them, not believing in them, in Stormwreck isle. 

-----------------

You can take this adventure anywhere you want tbh. How I am taking it is short and simple.

My follow up adventure is the memories of the dragonborns that has came down from space. The players will wake up in the City of Bral. Paint the city like a city of Tatooine, Neogi, beholders, drows in daylight, all friendly. All sorts of aliens races. Regardless I will then get them acquainted with the town and their current job/roles they have. Currently there is a large peace treaty amongs the Githyanki, Dragonborn, Spellweavers and the Neogi. These are the predominant races in the Tears of Selune who has political power. Regardless they learned there is a large colony of mind-flayers in Stardock. Stardock was going to be the next location for a city to be built, until they learned it's infested with mind flayers. So for the time being, the players (dragonborns) are in Bral, trying to play nice with other races, specifically the Githyankis. They have a ceasefire. The players are assisgned to patrol around a few blocks that host their embassy and residents of other dragonborn. This is when I introduce ""Vecna: Nest of the Eldritch Eye"" Module, revised to fit. I'll post a revised version later hopefully of the changes.

At the end of that one shot module, they won't learn who these cultists were worshipping for, but they stopped the plans and got the Vecna Link from there. Thus I can skip chapter 1 of Eve of Ruin later on.

Now, those evil cultists were trying to sacrifice some mind flayers though. This lead to a group of mind flayers coming in to save them, thus knocking out all the players unconscious. Now, the players have been kidnapped and taken away. Still unconscious, they finally wake up with a Githyanki breaks them free from Mind Flayer prison pod. The githyanki fills them in, the players are now located at ""The Skull of Void"" and must fight their way out with a handful of other prisoners. Another dungeon crawl map with tons of creepy crawlers. This dungeon is very fleshly, since the players are inside the body of a dead god floating in space. In the stomach area. They finally escape and can see space and a spelljammer that they must steal.

They managed to steal the spelljammer, long rest and got in radio touch with ""the council"" - The githyanki dumps info about a group of mind flayer and their thrall are going to make an attack on the spellweavers located at the King Killer Star and destroy the Black Obelisk located there. The Obelisk contains a demon that the flayers are hoping to control, knowing their colony is about to be attacked. The council orders the group to stop them, since they are closer to the star. 

Rogue spelljammer attacks your spelljammer, quick spaceship fight for the players. Skill Challenge.

Arrival at King Killer Star - so we know, lore wise, the King Killer Star or specifically the Dracorage had a very long absent in Toril. The reason for that is, because the weavers has installed a black obelisk and using the energy of the star to imprison the demon inside. Now the players arrive, big fight ensues, yada yada yada, players beat up the thralls and the single mind flayer (maybe with some assist or at a weakened stage). Happy ending.... not really.

A dimensional portal opens up, a strange figure walks out (It's Vecna, but they dont know it), cutscene time - Vecna blocks out everyone from interfering and one shots the spellweavers, breaks the obelisk, demon is released, attempts to attack vecna, he snaps his finger, demon gets banished to somewhere. The Obelisks gets broken into 4 shards, he grabs one, underhand tosses to the party. The party catches it. He tend sends the other 3 alongside many rocks and stuff at the group, super sonic speed - party dodges, but the remaining shards are flying directly to Toril. Vecna smirks, disappear. Party is left confused. 

Party returns to City of Bral - just before arriving, Githyanki gets a call from the council - Dragons and dragonborns going insane in Bral. Attacking everyone. A Dracorage event is beginning. The players are unaffected however (due to Vecna Link). The Council gets updated that the party are unaffected. Council under attack, warns them, tells them to warn other, tell the truth of the star. 

Off to Toril, just when they are about to enter the planet, rogue spelljammer direct hits their ship and they lose control. Ship crashes, they remember they survived, but then, the players wakes back up to their main characters.

I've now planted the seed of Vecna, wrapped everything up for Dragon of Stormwreck Isle, dumped a lot of lore and gave them a teaser of a spelljammer adventure. They move into Phandelver and Below + Dragons of icespire Peak revised, into Vecna Eve of Ruins. The Tower in Leilon, Thalivar's Tower is also a unique tower shaped spelljammer, allowing me to skip ch1 and take the players to the city of Sigil when the time comes.

Until recently I didn't get coffee much so I was just using a rule of thumb I do breweries, which is to tip $1 a beer. Same with bars, unless it's a more involved drink, then I'll do $2. This is if I'm only getting drinks. If I get food and alcohol, I just tip around 20% of the tab and call it a day.

My drink is $6.02 so $1 is around 18% but I know some people say lower tabs should be a flat minimum not a percentage.

If any baristas have an opinion I am interested in hearing it. Baristas only please, and I am pro-tipping and will never change my mind about that, so please no arguments about tipping in general. It's fine if you're anti-tipping, you can choose to not tip and I am not judging you for that but I also don't want to get into an argument about it.

However, when I use 18g on my standard basket, it always overflows a little bit when tamping. I was just wondering if getting a bigger basket size would affect anything.

So I managed a group of hostels for a few years. I have always had good teams around me, people that stuck for years and I absolutely trusted their judgement. These were loyal and hardworking young people that have done top notch work they should be proud of.

  
One of these people was my night auditor. He had worked with me for two years up to this point. We had gone out for lunch together, be out to parties, etc. He was extremely skilled socially and was a big joker. Sometimes I'd come to work and he would have made me hot tea with a motivational note: ""I had a shitty shift. *I hope yours is worse.*"" 

  
One day I come in and I'm reading his night report. All usual stuff. Some people came back at that time, some were loud and noisy, someone tried to do this or that, etc. Then, something caught my eye. He describes one of the guests leaving running in a *suit* at around 3am. 

Well, it's a hostel and someone in a suit is already weird enough. During that time and running seemed almost impossible. But the icing on the cake: He comes back carrying a 5l bottle of tomato juice.

I broke laughing when I read it. My night auditor insisted it that happened. I was incredulous. He was a jokester and as much as I trusted him, I knew he liked to exaggerate stories. We talked, I *yeah yeah yeah'd* him and sent him home.

Next few hours I'm in the kitchen making me some coffee... That's when a guest shows up... In a suit... I couldn't play it cool.

\- ""*Cool bottle you got there.""*

\- ""*Yeah""*

*-* ""*Tomato juice?""*

*- ""Yeah""*

*- ""All 5 liters?""*

*- ""Yeah""*

*- ""Are you in a special type of diet?""*

*- ""No, not really.""*

*- ""Cool, cool, cool, cool...""*

  
I had to apologise to my night auditor. We had a laugh about it. The randomness of it all. It still seems like a dream. That wasn't even the weirdest thing this guest ever did. But that's for another day.",14,1742049281.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,1,0.94,False

1jbwenh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Periods/comments/1jbwenh/intense_period_pain_for_years_heres_my/,Intense period pain for years - here’s my recipe/advice,"So i've struggled with gnarly periods for years. diagnosed with fibroids. felt like birth control damaged me. lower back injury which misaligned my pelvis. i also got lymes disease which fucked me up even more. 
so sharing my recipe on what has worked for me holistically, when pain killers literally weren't strong enough. i'm sharing this as a sister with an understanding that not everybody knows about herbs or food or physical movements. it was life changing for me when i really put this together. 

I don't take pills. i don't use a heating pad. 

*let me also say before consuming anything all contraindications should be researched 

I also want to say... I was gaslit for years about my pain. 
intense pain is NOT normal - it is a result of increased inflammation due to many factors such as stress, diet, or underlying conditions. do not gaslight yourself or let people in your life do the same. your pain is valid and deserves to be looked into. 

and these ALL have more benefits than i might be listing. 

Raspberry leaf tea - cannot stress how amazing this is for balancing hormones. i drink this all the time throughout my entire 28 day cycle. but even at times when i didn't... having it for bleeding time or right before is so helpful. 

cinnamon tea - inflammation fighter and warming helps with blood flow

turmeric tea - INCREDIBLE for inflammation and absolutely WILL help with pain, digestion, and blood flow!!! 

ginger tea - alleviates inflammation and helps with digestion which is a big factor in inflammation and headaches 

mint tea - helps cool the body when the pain is overheating and inflammation is intense. also good for digestion and headaches 

nettle tea - helps balance hormones and also good for digestion 

^ sometimes i make a combo tea when i need real help. i drink tea consistently throughout my entire cycle. 

(i know i left some amazing other herbs out, DEAR HERBAL BLEEDERS - share your info on this thread!!! )

iron supplement - for obvious reasons, this helps keep my uterus strong during shed and helps with healthy blood flow. on heavier flows, it keeps my body strong in general. 

nattokinase - an enzyme made from fermented soybeans that breaks up fibrin. this has been THE THING that breaks up blood clots and helps alleviate my cervix pain from that. it literally cleanses blood. i take this as a supplement only around my bleeding time. this one has contraindications - please read before consuming. 

one thing i really want to share is about inflammatory foods. when my diet consists highly of acidic, high omega-6, seed oils, sugar, over- processed foods, i experience pain to the max. 

when i kick out things like bread, sugar, coffee, rice, acidic fruits, excess vitamin c, and red meat... im able to manage things so much more smoothly. there are many many unexpectedly inflammatory foods!! such as tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers!

hydrating fruits (PAPAYA, watermelon, cucumber, etc.), steamed veggies (squash, sweet potato, pumpkin, swiss chard etc.), beans (lentils, kidney beans, black beans),  boiled chicken, salmon. greek yogurt. also lettuce, radishes, spinach, boiled OR raw apples (when boiled, they become probiotic), and small amounts of feta cheese. all foods that help keep me balanced 

BLEEDERS - please share foods that hurt or help you on this thread!

I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH how much pelvic floor exercises and certain yoga poses help alleviate my period pain - especially for my lower back. when I take 45 minutes to physically manage my pain rather than take a pill and wait in pain all that time, I am like a feather afterwards...plus did something good for myself in general. 

Yoga poses that help - 

child's pose,
cat-cow,
malasana,
laying down butterfly,
supine twist,
upward dog,
bridge pose held,

exercises that help me:

prone alternating leg lifts,
hover / plank,
6 inches up and down - or alternating feet,
bridge up and down,

I also find standing barefoot outside, swimming in the ocean or fresh water, soaking sunshine, sitting against a tree, and deep belly breathing - also contribute for me. Hot/cold water alternating in the shower 

This helps alleviate the pain when i don't have as much access or time to embrace all these physical revelievers : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ&vl=es


this is a simplified version. healing my pain required literal lifestyle adjustment and a lot of discipline. i hope at least something on this list can benefit someone else. As a sister, I want us all to be able to look deeply enough into our bodies to find what works for us individually. 

Fellow bleeders of all ages - I love you. please share what works and what doesn't work for you on this thread for those who don't have someone in their life to share this info. it is life changing.

1jbwd9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/InsideIndianMarriage/comments/1jbwd9y/life_has_changed_after_a_baby_in_the_most/,"Life has changed after a baby in the most unexpected way between my husband (38M) and I (34F), and I feel helpless","
 I (34F) and my husband (38M) had a baby girl 6 months ago. We wer married for 2 years before I got pregnant. We both are very respectful towards each other and love spending time together. Even after 3 years now, I still look forward to seeing him after work or infact hating work travels just so we won’t be able to see each other even if it was for a day. However, I would say that I am more expressive as a partner than he is, which I have made my peace with. He likes to show his love through acts of services, like making my coffee everyday, surprising me by cooking my fav dish when I come back from a work travel, etc. Even romantically, he was not as expressive, but after many conversations, this improved (for ex. i would always be the one toninitiate kissing or cuddling)

Throughout my pregnancy, he took great care of me and I was very comfortable. Even during the first 2-3 months after I gave birth, he made sure to guard me from any negative talks from family members and helped out 100% with the baby.

Now over the past 3 months, it is just us both taking care of the baby ourselves as I am on Mat leaves. I take care of her through the day and he takes over once he comes back home from work in the evening. Honestly, I have never seen a more present father and I thank my stars everyday.

Now, ever since I gave birth, like most women, I feel unattractive and insecure about how I look. Naturally, both being busy with the baby, our sex life is also hanging by a thread. However, I try to keep things romantic and interesting from my end. For ex., even though I look like I just got out of a whirlpool through the day, before he comes home, I freshen up and try to look nice for him (and this is almost every day). 
I made him a nice meal on Vday while managing the baby ( pls note he told me loves celebrating vday. I m not a big fan but I have been making it a point to do something spl for him every year since he likes it)

The thing is he is really obsessed with our daughter and doesn’t prefer to do anything else apart from being with her when he is at home. I understand and love that he loves her so much, but I miss us being a couple. We don’t even get to have a meal together anymore. Not once he has appreciated me trying to look nice for him, or said anything nice to me. He used to get me flowers occassionaly before I got pregnant and even once during my pregnancy and that has also stopped. Even yesterday, I dressed up in a saree and sent him a pic, to which he just reacted with a heart emoji, but still no words. He is constantly snapping at me for every little thing and I am getting really tired of it. Im crying in a corner all day thinking abt it and my hormones are also going crazy right now. Ineven had a conversation eith him last weekend about how I feel that we are drifting apart as a couple, to which he said he doesnt see any difference and that he will think about why I feel this way. Yet, through that week as well he did not make any romantic gestures.

I am already very anxious as I have to join work on Monday. My parents are here to help and i will be wfh, but still, this is going to be a huge change. However, I dont hear any supportive words from him. He is more worried about how well my parents will look after her and if we should get additional help. I understand his worry and I do think about the same. But I feel like I cant talk to him about how I feel. 

Today, I am extremely hurt because he made a statement about me not wanting him to talk to his parents. Pls note I video call his parents atleast 3 times a week when he is at work to show thrm the baby. Roles reversed, he wouldnt call my parents in my absense. I get along wth them very well and I want them to be present in her life. Today, while he was on a video call with them, I interrupted a couple of times  to ask some doubt about what I am cooking, as I was in a hurry to get things done while my daughter was calm n not hungry. He snapped at me after the call saying why I need to be in such a hurry and it seems like I dont want him to talk to his parents. I explained to him about how I was just trying to manage time fo which he responded saying “does it have to happen at the time Im talking to them” and “may be u didnt mean it thatw ay but it seemed like you did”, which is not any different.

I am not able to let go of this and I have been crying all day thinking about how unfair this is. I have mot spoken to him much through the day apart from anything to do with my daughter and he has not not brought this up. I feel like I am not going to be needed here if my daughter is not dependant on me for her food. I am also scared that we will continue to drift apart and wont have the privacy we did given the fact that one of our parents are going to be here for the next couple of yrs atleast to help out with the baby. I feel anxious thinking, god forbid, something happens to my daughter so much as her getting hurt(which is common for babies), he would never forgive me. I don’t know what to do. I usually dont shy away from having open conversations and im not a fan of yelling and fighting as Ive grown up seeing this. But I am frustrated at this point and feel helpless. What do I do?

1jbwctu,https://i.redd.it/cqqiutl76voe1.jpeg,2025 Cookbook Challenge: Oman 🇴🇲,"Didn’t take long to get through the last cookbook so…

On to Week #12 of my Cook Around Asia Challenge for 2025, where I read (but don’t necessarily cook from) a cookbook from a single country, territory, or region in Asia, in random order.

This week, I’m exploring the rich and diverse cuisine of OMAN 🇴🇲 with THE FOOD OF OMAN by Felicia Campbell. Omani food is a fascinating fusion of flavors, influenced by centuries of trade with East Africa, India, and Persia. With a deep dive into the traditions, spices, and stories that define the country’s cuisine, this book paints a vivid picture of life in Oman—its bustling souks, coastal fishing villages, and desert feasts. From fragrant spice blends to slow-cooked meats and seafood stews, this journey through Oman’s culinary landscape is both immersive and delicious.

On the menu: richly spiced shuwa (slow-roasted lamb), seafood dishes infused with coconut and turmeric, tender bread like khubz rakhal, and cardamom-scented Omani coffee. هتافات

Do you have a favorite Omani dish, cookbook, or travel/food memory?

1jbwcrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jbwcrm/i_found_porn_in_my_bf_search_history/,I found porn in my bf search history,"This morning, I (19F) went through my boyfriend’s (20M) phone. I know, not good at all, even weirder that I usually trust him but I just kind of felt like I had to ? He was still sleeping, and long story short, I found a porn account in his twitter search history. We have been together for about a year and a half, sexually active beginning at around 4 months in (each other’s firsts). He had previously told me that he used to watch a lot of porn, having started at around 13 years old. I was under the assumption that he had stopped, but I had also told him that I had no issue with him masturbating as long as it wasn’t watching porn.
To be clear, I loathe porn, everything about it, ideologically, politically, everything it represents, how much it hurts people etc. And I have spoken about that with him MANY times through unrelated conversations, how much I hate him, even telling him about stories of women discovering their partner were porn addicts (jokes write themselves lol) and he seemed to agree deeply with me.
I confronted him when he woke up, and kind of screamed very mean things to him, mainly that above hurt, I was so so disgusted and angry with his behaviour. He was extremely sorry, apologised profusely, told me he had been planning on seeing a therapist about it. Even told me he once told a doctor about it who linked it to his frequent insomnias and advised to see a psychanalyst. But that he didn’t have the courage to actually go and had been telling himself he would go at the beginning of the summer, once school and work would be over.
Now, I do totally understand the addiction part, I, myself, have battled, mainly thanks to him and his support, my smoking and drinking habits which were heavy and awful for my health. So I get the guilt, the back and forth, the wanting to stop but procrastinating, the habit more so than the will to do it, the mechanicality of it.
But I can’t help but feel betrayed, cheated on, disrespected deeply. He assured me that rather than the women, it was the act of watching porn itself that became tied to masturbation, becoming almost a condition of it, due to watching for so many years (I struggle understanding that, would appreciate explications). He also told me that he started watching again when we were long distance for 2 1/2 months this summer, at a rate of 3-4x/week and like once a week ever since my return.
I’m so torn between supporting his recovery, appreciating his will to see a therapist (he emailed like 7 when I went to make myself a coffee) and feeling so numb, betrayed, angry, disgusted. I think about all the things I’ve told him about hating porn, the industry. I can’t help but wonder how long he would have kept doing it if I hadn’t found out. He told me he’s very ashamed and knows it’s an illness but I just don’t know what to even do with myself!

It's a shame I bombed the interview so hard, but I was stuck speechless having met you.

October, 2023: There's no way I can show my face back at that store again...

March, 2024: I needed to learn models, and you were the expert. It's only natural I would have to talk to you about it. Somehow you convinced me to buy in fully.

June, 2024: I had a date that night. I was excited for it, but happy to chat with you about models. It's a shame my date saw us talking. The second she saw how you made me smile, our date was over. I can't blame her.

July, 2024: You told me to be careful about being so kind with my cards, but I was happy to let you have them. It'd be nice if we got coffee, but I was too much a coward. You even said we need to get to know each other better and I gave up the notion.

August 2024: You haven't asked my name for a while. Now you're asking when I'll be back. You make sure to come say goodbye since you're going on a trip. I know you're going to see her, but I convince myself it could be anything.

September 1, 2024: I can't stand it anymore - you need to know I fell for you. It turns out all the signs I saw weren't my imagination: you want me too. You're clearly into her more than me, and I'd rather you be happy than be mine, so I help you her way.

September 15, 2024: I can't hold it anymore. We have to talk to about it, I can't help it. You refused to kiss me because it's too intimate. Was that for me, or for you?

November 9, 2024: It's the last time I'll see you as I am. You pushed me to drop the anxiety and put myself out there. You were right as far as the game was concerned, but then you came to say goodbye. Who could resist watching you walk away.

November 13, 2024: It's finally time for surgery. One of the happiest days of my life and you're not even on my mind.

November 20, 2024: I told you my mom would want to see the store, you met her just as I predicted. Somehow you were a perfect gentlemen. She wanted to speak to you privately. She likes you even more than me, somehow she's taking your side.

December 21, 2024: I don't get to go home for the holidays so I'm stuck here. I brought cookies ""for everyone"" but really they're for you. You wouldn't take one...

January 1, 2025: I don't know that you understand how important the golden dollar you gave me really is. It changes lives whether we like it or not.

January 5, 2025: you finally tried my cookies. Snickerdoodles are your favorite, huh? They're also my best recipe.

January 11, 2025: You said you'd be there if I ever needed someone. But that was a lie wasn't it?

February 4, 2025: What a fun game. It inspired me to take risks - including asking you to brunch. I wanted to get closer - but you decided to get further. This is where you muted me. Why would you want me when you could be getting prescription drugs anyway right?

February 6, 2025: I lose my closest friend.

February 9, 2025: Now you get to meet my sister. She doesn't understand the appeal, but you're a perfect gentlemen. You nerded out more than you're usually comfortable - it was the cutest thing I've ever seen. I was speechless with a stupid smile - am I smitten??

February 13, 2025: I don't know what else to change so I'll go with my hair. Hope you notice <3

February 15, 2025: Not only do you not notice the hair, but you have to judge the wierdest game I ever played. You're call was bad, but you were asked a question that didn't fit what was needed. You tried explaining, but all I could hear is that you were having a tough time talking. I'd rather lose than make you suffer that - it's just a game.

February 16, 2025: You can't speak, but it's the event you were so excited for. The least I could do is bring some life for the wallflowers and make a success of it from what you started. You took pictures of us, I told you I'm uncomfortable with pictures but I trust you. I think you took one you didn't share, I hope so. I hope you're alright.

February 24, 2025: I dropped. I don't mind losing, but I can't interact with others. You asked if everything is okay but I know you don't want to answer to what's not. We can leave it at that.

February 26, 2025: V, my ex, swooped in. He knew I'm vulnerable and need someone - willing to fill the gap as toxic as ever.

March 6, 2025: I finally gain some self respect. I'm tired of being called stupid, simple, and selfish. Fuck V. I'm fine on my own, I don't need him one bit.

March 9, 2025: My best friend has seen I started drinking again, I wonder if she even cares anymore. It's a fun time until I come by your store for party prep. I thought I was over it, but the second I see you it hits me all over again. Doesn't help how well you know my tastes, as usual. You need me to come back tommorow.

March 10, 2025: My therapist says I shouldn't give you the time of day, but afterword I'm at a crosswords. I take the short way home, or the long way that passes your way. I pick the long way and you hit me up within a block. I made the right choice.

March 12, 2025: I know you said you were too busy, but I want you to come to game night. You seemed okay with recieving the invite. I hope you can make it - I can't shake you from my mind.

March 14, 2025: I forgot about you for a second - I solidly didn't care. My friends made fun of me for inviting you but they get it. It didn't hit until you hit my feed. Do you really think your ugly? That's insane - you're the most handsome man I've seen.

I should have asked you about your childhood—well, you willingly told me about that. About how you fought with your brother over the home computer and how your mom disciplined you in the most amusing way. But I should have asked what you were like back then. Did you have bunny teeth? Did you like cotton candy? Did you enjoy amusement parks? Do you still bear scars from your old wounds?

I should have asked about your name aside from the one you gave me. Was it your second name? How did your parents come up with it? Did you like it when you were younger? Did your friends make fun of you because of it?

My bells jangled when I knocked on Cody’s door. He waved me into the bedroom with a leer.

“Queer bait,” he read aloud the message on my garment. “I think that describes you perfectly, don’t you think, Mirabella?”

“Um, yes, Master.”

“Do a little dance for me, sissy. See if you can turn me on.”

I felt utterly ridiculous as I sashayed around the bedroom, doing my best to act sexy amid the sound of my tinkling bells. As I writhed, bumped and grinded, I licked my lips, batted my eyes and blew kisses, abasing myself to avoid a session with the belt.

After a few excruciating minutes, my master patted the mattress and said, “Okay, get in position.”

I climbed onto the bed and knelt with my face in the sheets and my butt in the air, holding my cheeks open with both hands and waiting for the inevitable onslaught.

Instead, Cody reached between my legs and fondled my balls, which made me jump.

He laughed. “What’s wrong, sissy, does that tickle?”

“No, Master, it just surprised me.”

He snorted before grabbing my scrotum and squeezing.

“YEEEOWWWW, OW, PLEASE, MASTER, OW, OWWWWW!”

Through the screaming pain and tinkling bells, I heard a chuckle. “Oh, be quiet, sissy. You may not have these little things for long, so enjoy whatever gets done to them.” He flicked my testicle with his finger, causing another wave of nauseating agony. “I’m gonna talk to Liz about having you castrated. How’s that sound?”

Without waiting for an answer, he shoved his dick up my ass with a mighty thrust, and I screamed bloody murder. My sphincter already was already raw from Aunt Sheila’s huge strap-on the night before, and my master’s latest assault was pure torture.

As Cody raped me, as was his habit, he carried on a casual conversation as if we were sitting in a coffee shop chatting over lattes.

“I think Liz would be more comfortable having you take care of our baby if you were a eunuch,” he said, causing me to try to vocalize a question that came out as “uuuuuuuuuuhaaaahhby?”

My master chuckled. “No, she’s not pregnant yet, but we’re trying. Aunt Sheila says her doctor friend, who was a client, by the way, knows how to make men lactate. She says there’s a whole bunch of drugs you’d need to take, but his method supposedly works. Liz is still kind of hinky about that, but she says she’s glad you’ll be around to change diapers and do all the other nanny stuff. I’m thinking she’d like it if you were a eunuch, too. How about you? Would you like being my little eunuch sissy maid?”

“Ow, I … ow, owwwww, I … don’t know … OWWW … Master,” I tried to answer as he continued plowing into me with his huge flesh sword.

He slapped me on the head. “Oh, stop being so wishy-washy. What do you mean, you don’t know? Of course, you want to get your balls cut off for me. Right?”

“Ow, y-es, Mas—OWWWWW! … yes, Master.”

“Beg me to do it.”

“Ow, ow, please … OW! … please, Master, will you … make me a eunuch?”

“Well, since you asked so nicely.” He grabbed my hair and increased his pace until he shot his load into my guts.

When I turned to suck my master clean, I saw blood on his cock.

He looked down and laughed. “Damn, I blew that butthole out, huh?”

“Y-yes, Master.”

“Did Aunt Sheila use her strap-on last night?”

“I … Master, I’m not supposed to say.”

He smirked and ruffled my hair. “She’s training you pretty good, sissy.” He waved his dick under my nose. “Now get to work.”

It took several minutes to lick my master clean, and then I was dismissed with a slap on the ass. I limped to the half-bath and washed up, tucking a wad of toilet paper between my butt-cheeks so I wouldn’t bleed everywhere.

Then, with no rest for the weary, I started my chores, wallowing in the aftermath of my master’s sexual assault. My insides churned with the same self-loathing, horniness, confusion and doubt that always plagued me whenever Cody sodomized me. I hated it, and it hurt like a motherfucker — but, damn it, no matter how often I tried to tell myself otherwise, I wanted more.

Was that because my pitiful life was so bereft of affection that even brutal rapes seemed better than being completely ignored? Was I such a submissive soul that I fell for anyone who treated me like shit? Certainly, Liz had been rude, dismissive and bossy with me long before Cody reentered the picture; maybe that’s why I was so head-over-heels in love with her. Maybe my master’s harsh treatment was causing me to have the same feelings for him.

There was no such confusion over how I felt about the prospect of having my nuts cut off. The worst part was, my master had made me beg to be castrated. It seemed a bridge too far, and I seriously contemplated asking for a divorce. Liz’s boss was neutralized by the threat of the compromising photos of her motel rendezvous with her lover being made public, so there was no need for me to continue pretending to be married. I would bear no guilt if I removed myself from the dysfunctional household that had been turned upside down, first by Cody and then his diabolical aunt.

But I put that thought out of my head when I contemplated life without Liz. Even though she’d treated me like a dog from the very beginning, I loved her. I had no idea why, but I did.

For the umpteenth time, I squared my shoulders and vowed to put aside the negative thoughts and try to be the best maid I could be — testicles or no testicles.

Aunt Sheila returned from her shopping trip just before noon, and she had me cook and serve lunch, which she ate while I sat on the carpet rubbing her feet. By then, Cody had taken what had become his Audi to go to a session with his psychiatrist and run other errands, leaving me alone with the hateful old bat.

When she finished eating, Aunt Sheila pulled her foot from my hand and touched her big toe to my nose. “Did you have fun last night, Mirabella?”

“Um, yes, Ma’am,” I lied.

“Me too.” She smiled. “And now that I’ve eaten, I’m ready for another go-around. Run up to my room, pull down your panties, bend over, and wait for me. We’re going to have some more fun, Mirabella. Now, what do you say?”

My heart sank, but I managed to keep a straight face and reply, “Thank you, Ma’am.”

The next hour was absolutely miserable. This time, while Aunt Sheila pegged me, she used a fiberglass cane from her little black bag to lay welts across my back and buttocks. When she was finished, she put my tongue to work between her legs again, keeping me at it until it was time to pick up the girls from school.

I could barely stay awake during the drive to Central High, although I was jolted upright when I pulled up in front of the school. To my horror, I saw that Brooke and Mia were accompanied by a group of about twenty students.

“Get out of the van, Mirabella,” Brooke instructed.

With my face getting redder by the second, I wiggled out of the minivan and stood near the curb, looking at the ground.

“Do a curtsey,” Mia ordered. When I complied, there was a smattering of laughter.

“Dang, you guys really DO have a trans maid,” a young man said.

“That is SO cool,” a girl added, and several others nodded their agreement.

“He has to do whatever we say.” Mia ripped a page from her notebook, balled it up and threw it on the sidewalk. “Pick that up,” she told me. As I bent to comply, she added: “With your mouth.”

Overcome by shame, I used my lips to grip the crumbled sphere before standing upright.

“Make him eat it,” a tall boy said.

“Ooh, yeah, make him eat it.” A chubby girl grinned.

Brooke shook her head. “No, we’re not gonna do that.” She turned to me. “Go throw that in the garbage can over there, Mirabella, and then drive us home,” she said, showing off for her friends while sticking up for me at the same time.

To the great amusement of the gathered crowd, I curtseyed, said, “Yes, Miss,” and tottered to the bin to do Brooke’s bidding. When I returned and curtseyed, the kids broke out in applause.

I was only too happy pull away after the girls got into the minivan to the cheers of their friends.

With both teens squealing in delight, Mia held up her hand, and Brooke gave her a high-five.

“OMG, that was fucking AWESOME!” Mia leaned forward and patted me on the shoulder. “You were PERFECT back there!”

“Yeah, he was — he even impressed Rona Cobbham. Want to see if Dad will take off five check marks?” Brooke asked her sister. I looked in the rearview mirror and we briefly made eye contact.

“Sure,” Mia replied.

That one word from the younger sibling made me want to cry. While taking away the points meant one less week of punishment, which was no small consideration, what caused me to become emotional was the rare gesture of kindness, and knowing I had done something to please my former stepdaughters, even if it had come at the expense of a little dignity.

I floated on a cloud the rest of the afternoon, despite having endured two sexual assaults earlier that day. But as dinnertime approached, my good mood started to dissipate.

Some sort of discipline was forthcoming. I prayed it wouldn’t be too bad, and that the girls might put in a good word for me in addition to asking to have five check marks removed from my tally.

Never thought I’d be posting on a depression subreddit, I shamefully always thought it was a result of circumstance, perhaps I’m eating my own words now 

I’m 26, I have a great paying job, it’s everything I’ve wanted. I have a beautiful wife, a brand new home that’s perfect for us, I have two really amazing fluffy cats. I was raised in a good family, two parents that loved each other (at least when I was being raised), a great older brother, a great extended family with cousins who I consider best friends. I have great friends outside my family. I love and fear God, though my faith has been a struggle as of late as I struggle with sin (just adding in my religion here for context, not the point)

And yet recently, when I wake up early on Saturday mornings before my wife and come down to feed the cats and have a coffee in silence, I feel empty. I feel empty, sad, unmotivated. I just don’t have anything to look forward to. Everything is so fleeting and it feels like all the things I used to enjoy just feel like “cheap highs” that I know will end and I’ll end up in the same slump 

I have never felt this way and it seems to get worse and worse by the week. I just don’t feel anything or care. I spend hours just sitting in silence when I can because the things I used to look forward to don’t do anything for me anymore and just feel like a chore, like
I’m lying to myself saying “I enjoy this”

What I hate most is that I have a life most people my age would kill for, yet here I am just getting through each day, each week. Every time it’s Friday it feels like I’m in a cycle of the same thing over and over and over again.

Maybe it’s a seasonal thing? I don’t know. I’ve been to therapy, I don’t think it’ll help much. My biggest help is my faith but even then it doesn’t offer much in terms of me not feeling this cyclical monotony of each week just dragging me down

The Blackwoods were new to Raven's Hollow, but their reputation preceded them. They'd bought the Victorian mansion at the end of Willow Street—the one that had stood empty for nearly a decade after old Mrs. Fincher died in her sleep and wasn't found for weeks. Everyone in our small town knew about the house with its peeling gingerbread trim and overgrown gardens. Everyone avoided it.

Everyone except the Blackwoods, who moved in last month and immediately began renovations, though no one ever saw any workers coming or going. The house transformed almost overnight—fresh paint, manicured grounds, new windows that reflected sunlight during the day but remained impenetrably dark after sunset.

I wouldn't have taken the babysitting job if I hadn't been desperate. My car needed repairs that would cost more than I made in a month at the diner, and my college tuition payment was due in two weeks. When Mrs. Blackwood approached me at the end of my shift, laying a cool hand on my wrist and offering double the going rate to watch their daughter for a single night, saying no felt like an unaffordable luxury.

""We've heard you're responsible, Eliza,"" she said, her voice carrying a faint accent I couldn't place. Her eyes were an unusual amber color.

""Mabel needs someone... trustworthy.""

I'd never seen the Blackwoods' daughter around town or at the local school. When I mentioned this, Mrs. Blackwood smiled thinly. ""Mabel has special needs. We homeschool her.""

""I don't have much experience with special needs children,"" I admitted.

""She's not difficult,"" Mr. Blackwood interjected, appearing beside his wife so suddenly I startled. He was tall and gaunt, with the same unusual amber eyes as his wife. ""She mostly keeps to herself. You'll just need to follow our rules precisely.""

They both stared at me expectantly, their identical eyes unblinking. The diner suddenly seemed too quiet, as if everyone was listening while pretending not to.

""What kind of rules?"" I asked, trying to sound professional.

""Simple routines. Children thrive on structure,"" Mrs. Blackwood replied. ""We'll provide detailed instructions. Nothing complicated.""

I needed that money. And it was just one night.

""When do you need me?""

Their smiles widened. ""Friday evening. We'll be attending a special event and won't return until dawn Saturday."" Mrs. Blackwood slid a thick cream-colored envelope across the counter. ""Our address and half your payment in advance. The rest when we return.""

Inside the envelope was $150 in crisp bills and a card with elegant calligraphy: The Blackwood Residence, 13 Willow Street. On the back, in the same flowing script: Arrive promptly at 6:00 PM. Not earlier. Not later.

Friday arrived quicker than I'd hoped. I spent the week asking subtle questions around town, learning frustratingly little about the Blackwoods. They kept to themselves. They had no visitors. They ordered groceries online rather than shopping locally. The few who had interacted with them described the same details—their unusual amber eyes, their formal way of speaking, their excessive politeness that somehow made people more uncomfortable rather than less.

My best friend Nan, whose mother worked at the town records office, told me the Blackwoods had bought the house in cash, with paperwork filed by a law firm from three states away. ""And get this,"" she'd whispered during lunch break, ""they requested copies of all historical documents about the property going back to its construction in 1897. Mom said they seemed especially interested in the original blueprints and something about a sealed root cellar.""

At 5:45 PM on Friday, I parked my beat-up Honda a block away from 13 Willow Street, not wanting to arrive unfashionably early after their specific instructions. The October evening was unseasonably cold, a mist rising from the ground around the Blackwood house, clinging to its sharp gables and newly restored tower like ghostly fingers.

At precisely 6:00 PM, I rang the doorbell, its somber chime reverberating inside like a funeral bell. Mrs. Blackwood opened the door wearing an elegant black evening gown that belonged in another century, her dark hair swept up in an intricate style adorned with what looked like tiny bones but had to be antique hairpins.

""Right on time,"" she said, ushering me inside. ""Punctuality is appreciated in this household.""

The interior was nothing like I'd expected. Based on the Victorian exterior, I'd imagined dusty antiques and faded wallpaper. Instead, the house was minimally furnished with stark, modern pieces in black, white, and deep crimson. No family photos adorned the walls—only large abstract paintings that seemed to shift slightly when viewed from different angles.

Mr. Blackwood descended the sweeping staircase, similarly dressed in formal black attire that emphasized his unnaturally pale skin. ""Mabel is already in bed,"" he said without preamble. ""She shouldn't wake until precisely 11:00 PM for her evening routine.""

""She's asleep? At six in the evening?"" I asked, immediately regretting the question when both Blackwoods stared at me with identical expressions of mild disapproval.

""Mabel's circadian rhythm is... unconventional,"" Mrs. Blackwood explained. ""She requires exactly seventeen hours of sleep per day, broken into specific intervals.""

""Of course,"" I nodded, as if this made perfect sense. ""Should I check on her or—""

""Absolutely not,"" Mr. Blackwood interrupted sharply. His expression immediately softened to something attempting warmth but achieving only a mechanical approximation. ""That is, not until 11:00 PM precisely. Mabel's sleep is easily disturbed, and the consequences can be... challenging.""

Mrs. Blackwood handed me another cream-colored envelope, this one sealed with dark red wax impressed with an unusual symbol—something like a tree with too many branches, or perhaps a many-limbed figure.

""Inside you'll find our contact information and Mabel's care instructions. Please read them thoroughly before 11:00 PM and follow them without deviation."" Her amber eyes held mine with uncomfortable intensity. ""For Mabel's well-being. And your own.""

""The rules may seem odd,"" Mr. Blackwood added, ""but they address Mabel's unique needs. Deviation could upset her delicate equilibrium.""

""We'll return at dawn,"" Mrs. Blackwood continued. ""You're welcome to use the kitchen and living room, but please remain on the ground floor except when attending to Mabel. The basement and attic are strictly off-limits due to ongoing renovations.""

""And our private quarters on the third floor,"" Mr. Blackwood added. ""Also off-limits.""

I nodded, clutching the envelope. ""I understand.""

""One last thing,"" Mrs. Blackwood said, her hand on the doorknob. ""If anyone comes to the door or calls the house phone, do not acknowledge them in any way. We're not expecting visitors, and Mabel becomes... distressed by unexpected social interaction.""

They departed without further explanation, leaving me alone in the eerily quiet house. As their car pulled away, I could have sworn I heard a faint scratching sound from somewhere above, like fingernails dragging slowly across wood.

With trembling fingers, I broke the wax seal and unfolded the heavy parchment within.

The parchment unfolded into three pages of the same elegant calligraphy, titled ""Care Instructions for Mabel."" The first page contained what appeared to be a schedule:

6:00 PM – 11:00 PM: Mabel's First Sleep Cycle (Do not disturb)

11:00 PM – 11:17 PM: Evening Routine (See specific instructions)

11:17 PM – 3:43 AM: Mabel's Second Sleep Cycle (Regular monitoring required)

3:43 AM – 4:00 AM: Midnight Nourishment (See specific instructions)

4:00 AM – Dawn: Mabel's Third Sleep Cycle (Do not disturb)

The oddly specific times sent a chill down my spine. What kind of child adhered to a schedule measured to the minute? And who called 3:43 AM ""midnight""?

The second page contained a list of rules, each written in blood-red ink that seemed to shimmer faintly in the living room's dim light:

RULES FOR MABEL'S CARE :

Rule 1 : Do not enter Mabel's room before 11:00 PM precisely. Early entry will disrupt her sleep cycle and cause distress.

Rule 2 : Mabel must consume 6 oz. of the prepared red liquid in the refrigerator (labeled ""M's Evening Refreshment"") during her evening routine. She must finish every drop.

Rule 3 : The music box on Mabel's dresser must be wound exactly three times and played during her evening consumption. No more, no less.

Rule 4 : Always speak to Mabel in a whisper. Her auditory sensitivity makes normal speech painful.

Rule 5 : Mabel's room must remain illuminated by candlelight only. The candles (provided on her dresser) must remain lit until she returns to sleep. If any candle extinguishes, relight it immediately.

Rule 6 : The mirrors in Mabel's room have been covered for her comfort. Do not uncover them under any circumstances.

Rule 7 : Mabel may ask to look out the window. This is strictly prohibited after sundown.

Rule 8 : If Mabel requests a bedtime story, read only from the book provided on her nightstand. Do not substitute other reading material.

Rule 9 : When checking on Mabel during her second sleep cycle, maintain a distance of at least three feet from her bed. Do not touch her, even if she appears distressed.

Rule 10 : During her Midnight Nourishment, Mabel must consume the entire preparation in the blue container marked with today's date. She may resist; however, complete consumption is non-negotiable.

Rule 11 : If you hear scratching from inside the walls, recite the rhyme written on the back of this page three times. The sound should subside.

Rule 12 : Should Mabel ask about ""The Others,"" change the subject immediately and notify us upon our return.

Rule 13 : In case of power failure, use only the matches and candles provided in the kitchen drawer marked ""Emergency."" Do not use flashlights or battery-powered devices.

Rule 14 : If Mabel speaks in any language other than English, record her exact words on the notepad by the telephone without attempting to respond.

Rule 15 : Under no circumstances should Mabel be permitted to leave her room. The door must remain closed when you are not actively attending to her needs.

I flipped to the third page, which contained detailed descriptions of where to find everything I would need—Mabel's ""refreshments"" in specific containers in the refrigerator, the emergency supplies, and a curious note about a ""protective boundary"" of salt around Mabel's bed that ""must remain unbroken throughout the night.""

On the back was the rhyme referenced in Rule 11:

Whisper, whisper, in the walls, What walks the night within these halls? By spoken word and candle's light, Return to shadow, flee from sight.

At the bottom of the page, a final instruction was written in larger, bolder letters:

If all else fails, and Mabel's behavior becomes severely abnormal, call the number provided and say ONLY these words: ""The sapling seeks the old root."" Then lock yourself in the iron-reinforced pantry in the kitchen until we return.

My hand trembled as I set the pages down on the coffee table. These weren't care instructions for a special needs child. They were more like... containment protocols.

I glanced at my phone: 6:23 PM. Still more than four and a half hours before I would meet Mabel. Part of me wanted to leave immediately, abandon the job and the promised second payment, drive away from this house with its bizarre rules and creeping sense of wrongness.

But my practical side argued against overreaction. Perhaps Mabel had severe autism or another condition that required strict routines. The covered mirrors, the whispered speech, the candlelight instead of electric lights—those could all be accommodations for extreme sensory sensitivities. The odd specific times and seemingly ritualistic elements might be comforting to a child who needed rigid structure.

Besides, I'd already accepted half the payment. And where would that leave Mabel if I abandoned her?

I decided to investigate the house—just the ground floor, as instructed—to familiarize myself with the layout. The living room opened into a formal dining room with a long table of dark polished wood and eight high-backed chairs. No family photos here either, just more of those unsettling abstract paintings.

The kitchen was unexpectedly modern, with sleek stainless steel appliances and stark white countertops. I opened the refrigerator and found Mabel's ""Evening Refreshment""—a crystal decanter containing a thick red liquid that could have been tomato juice or a berry smoothie in the refrigerator's bluish light. The blue container for her ""Midnight Nourishment"" sat beside it, sealed with an embossed wax similar to the envelope.

I checked the pantry next and found the reinforced door mentioned in the emergency instructions. It looked like a small walk-in food storage area, but the door was unusually thick, made of what appeared to be iron plating over wood, with heavy bolts that could be secured from the inside. What kind of family needs a panic room disguised as a pantry?

As I turned to leave the kitchen, movement outside the window caught my eye. A figure stood at the edge of the property where the manicured lawn met the beginning of the woods—a tall, thin silhouette barely visible in the gathering dusk. I stepped closer to the window, straining to see more clearly.

The figure raised what looked like a hand in greeting, then took a step forward. As it moved into a patch of clearer visibility, I realized with growing unease that its proportions weren't quite right. The limbs seemed too long, the neck too thin to support what should have been a head.

The telephone rang, its sudden shrill tone making me jump. I recalled Mrs. Blackwood's instruction not to answer, but my eyes remained fixed on the disturbing figure outside. It had taken another step closer, and I could now see that what I'd taken for clothing was actually...

The phone continued ringing insistently. I tore my gaze away from the window to glance at the antique rotary phone mounted on the wall. When I looked back outside, the figure was gone.

I backed away from the window, heart pounding. The phone fell silent after the seventh ring, leaving the house in unnerving quiet once more. I returned to the living room on shaky legs, trying to convince myself I'd imagined the strange figure. Perhaps it was just a trick of the light.

As I settled onto the couch, I noticed something I'd missed before—a baby monitor placed on the coffee table. Its power light glowed red in the dim room, suggesting it was connected to a receiver somewhere upstairs. In Mabel's room, presumably.

Against my better judgment, I reached for it, turning up the volume slightly. At first, I heard nothing. Then, faintly, a sound came through the speaker— breathing, slow and deep, but with an odd catch at the end of each exhale, almost like a quiet click or chirp.

Not the breathing of any child I'd ever heard.

I quickly turned the volume back down, setting the monitor exactly as I'd found it. The rules had said not to disturb Mabel until 11:00 PM precisely, and I intended to follow that instruction to the letter.

The house creaked and settled around me as evening deepened into night. Once, I thought I heard that scratching sound again, coming from inside the walls, but it subsided before I could determine its source.

At 10:30 PM, I gathered what I would need for Mabel's evening routine—the crystal decanter from the refrigerator, now sitting out to warm to room temperature as specified in the instructions. I found the matches and additional candles in a drawer by the sink, exactly where the instructions indicated they would be.

At 10:55 PM, I began climbing the sweeping staircase to the second floor, my heart pounding faster with each step. The upper hallway was long and lined with doors on both sides, all closed except for one at the far end that stood slightly ajar. A soft golden glow of candlelight spilled from the opening.

Mabel's room.

I checked my phone: 10:58 PM. Two minutes until I was permitted to enter. I stood outside her door, listening. The strange breathing I'd heard on the monitor was audible even through the door, but now it seemed faster, as if in anticipation.

As if Mabel knew I was waiting.

My phone changed to 11:00 PM precisely. Taking a deep breath, I pushed the door open and stepped into the candlelit room to meet the Blackwoods' daughter.

The bedroom was larger than I'd expected, with high ceilings and walls painted a deep burgundy that appeared almost black in the flickering candlelight. Heavy velvet curtains covered the windows, and as instructed, all mirrors were draped with dark cloths.

In the center of the room stood an ornate four-poster bed with a canopy of midnight-blue fabric. Inside lay a small figure bundled under thick blankets.

""Mabel?"" I whispered, remembering Rule 4 about speaking only in whispers. ""It's time for your evening routine. I'm Eliza, your babysitter for tonight.""

The bundle stirred. Slowly, the blankets pulled back to reveal a girl who appeared about eight years old, with porcelain-pale skin and straight black hair that fell to her waist. She sat up with deliberate, graceful movements that seemed oddly practiced, like a performer in a music box.

Then she opened her eyes.

They were amber, identical to her parents', but where theirs had been unsettling, Mabel's were genuinely disturbing—too large for her small face, with a faint luminescence that caught the candlelight like a cat's eyes reflecting headlights.

""You're new,"" she whispered, her voice high and melodic but with an underlying rasp, as if she rarely used it. ""Where is Miss Winters?""

I hesitated, uncertain who Miss Winters was. ""Your parents asked me to stay with you tonight. They'll be back at dawn.""

Mabel tilted her head at an uncomfortably sharp angle, studying me. ""Miss Winters didn't follow the rules. Do you know the rules, Eliza?""

The way she said my name sent a chill down my spine, each syllable stretched out with unnatural precision.

""Yes,"" I replied, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Your parents left detailed instructions. It's time for your evening refreshment.""

I approached the bed, remembering to maintain the three-foot distance specified in Rule 9. Up close, I noticed more unsettling details—Mabel's fingernails were slightly too long and came to sharp points, and beneath her pale skin, her veins were visible but seemed to pulse with darker fluid than normal blood.

""The music box first,"" she whispered, pointing to an ornate silver object on her dresser. ""Three turns. No more, no less.""

Following Rule 3, I wound the music box exactly three times. It began playing a haunting melody I didn't recognize—something in a minor key with discordant notes that seemed to hang in the air longer than they should.

Mabel closed her eyes, swaying slightly to the music. ""Now my refreshment.""

I poured the thick red liquid into the crystal glass provided. It had the consistency of tomato juice but smelled faintly metallic. I tried not to think about what it might be as I handed it to her, careful not to touch her fingers.

Mabel drank slowly, methodically, her eyes remaining closed. With each swallow, the strange pulse in her veins seemed to grow more pronounced, the dark fluid moving faster under her translucent skin.

""All of it,"" I whispered when she paused. ""You need to finish every drop.""

She opened her eyes, studying me with that unnerving amber gaze. ""You're afraid,"" she stated, not a question. ""But not as afraid as you should be.""

She drained the glass, then extended it toward me. A drop of the red liquid clung to her upper lip, which she licked away with a tongue that seemed just slightly too long, too pointed.

""Would you like to hear why Miss Winters isn't here anymore?"" she asked, her whisper dropping even lower.

I shook my head, taking the empty glass and setting it on the dresser. ""It's time for your second sleep cycle now, Mabel. Is there anything else you need before—""

""A story,"" she interrupted, pointing to the leather-bound book on her nightstand. ""From the special book. It helps me sleep.""

I picked up the book, surprised by its weight and the warmth of its leather binding. The cover was blank except for a symbol matching the wax seal from the envelope—that strange tree with too many branches, or perhaps a figure with too many limbs.

""Any particular story?"" I asked, opening to the table of contents. The chapter titles were in a language I didn't recognize—angular symbols that hurt my eyes to look at directly.

""Page forty-three,"" Mabel said, settling back against her pillows. ""The Sapling and the Root. It's my favorite.""

I found the page, relieved to see that the story itself was written in English, though in an archaic style with unfamiliar words scattered throughout the text. I began reading in a whisper as instructed:

""In the time before time, when the Old Ones still walked between worlds, there grew a sapling at the edge of the Great Darkness. Unlike its kin, who stretched their branches toward the light, this sapling yearned for what lay beneath, sending its roots deep into the shadows where no living thing should grow.""

As I read, Mabel's breathing changed. Her eyes remained open, fixed on the ceiling, and in the flickering candlelight, I could have sworn they were growing larger, the amber color spreading to where the whites should be.

""The Deep Root welcomed the sapling's seeking tendrils, for it had waited eons for such communion. 'What is planted in darkness shall bear fruit in light,' whispered the Deep Root. 'What is born of two worlds shall open the way for those who hunger beyond the veil.'""

Mabel's lips moved in perfect synchronization with the words, as if she knew the text by heart. A thin line of dark fluid trickled from the corner of her right eye, like a tear but too thick, too dark.

""Thus began the Binding, a pact written in substances beyond blood, beyond bone. The sapling would wear the light as a mask, would walk among the unknowing, until the fruit ripened and the way could be opened once more.""

My voice faltered as I realized I was reading no ordinary bedtime story. This was something else—something that felt like a history, or worse, a prophecy.

""Don't stop,"" Mabel whispered, her voice now layered with subtle undertones that hadn't been there before. ""The best part comes next.""

I continued reading, my mouth dry with fear:

""For seven generations the fruit would grow, nourished by the blood of the unwary, until the Seventh Child reached the Seventh Turning. And when the stars aligned in the pattern of the Opener, the fruit would be harvested, the mask would fall away, and Those Who Wait Beyond would taste freedom once more.""

The candlelight flickered violently, casting monstrous shadows across the walls—shadows that didn't match Mabel's small form or my hunched silhouette. For a fraction of a second, I saw something else reflected in the window glass—not Mabel's bedroom, but a vast, dark space filled with writhing shapes and reaching tendrils.

""'How shall I know when the time has come?' asked the sapling. And the Deep Root answered: 'When the guardian grows weary, when the rules are broken, when the innocent fulfills the pact unwittingly—then shall you know that the Harvest is upon us.'""

As I finished the passage, the music box played its final notes, winding down with a discordant clang. Mabel's eyes drifted shut, her breathing returning to that strange rhythm I'd heard earlier—deep inhalations followed by that unsettling click on the exhale.

I closed the book with trembling hands, returning it to the nightstand. Mabel appeared to be asleep, her small chest rising and falling with those unnatural breaths, the dark fluid that had leaked from her eye now dried to a flaky crust on her pale cheek.

According to the schedule, her second sleep cycle would last until 3:43 AM—more than four hours from now. I was supposed to check on her regularly during this period, but the thought of returning to this room made my skin crawl.

As I turned to leave, Mabel's whisper froze me in place: ""Eliza?""

I looked back. Her eyes remained closed, her body still.

""Have you figured it out yet?"" she whispered. ""What I am?""

""You're a little girl who needs her rest,"" I replied, trying to sound calm and authoritative despite my racing heart.

A smile spread across her face—too wide, revealing teeth that seemed sharper than they had before. ""Miss Winters thought so too. Until she broke Rule Nine and came too close during my second sleep cycle."" Her eyes opened suddenly, now completely amber with no whites visible at all. ""Would you like to see what happened to Miss Winters?""

""No, thank you,"" I said firmly, backing toward the door. ""I'll check on you later, Mabel. Sleep well.""

As I closed the door, I heard her whisper one last thing: ""The Others are restless tonight. They know it's almost time.""

I hurried downstairs to the living room, my mind racing with what I'd just witnessed. The strange story, Mabel's disturbing transformation as she drank the red liquid, her cryptic warnings about Miss Winters—whoever that was—and ""The Others"" mentioned in Rule 12.

What had I gotten myself into?

Back in the living room, I paced nervously, checking my phone to see if I had any reception. The signal showed one fluctuating bar—not enough to reliably call for help, assuming I even had a coherent explanation for what was happening. What would I say? I'm babysitting a child who might not be human, who drinks something that looks like blood, whose bedtime story sounds like an eldritch prophecy?

I tried texting Nan anyway: ""At Blackwood house. Something wrong with the kid. Might need help."" The message showed as undelivered, the sending animation cycling endlessly.

The baby monitor on the coffee table emitted that strange rhythmic breathing, accompanied now by occasional whispers too faint to make out. Was Mabel talking in her sleep, or was she speaking to someone—or something—else in her room?

I checked the time: 11:43 PM. Four hours until the cryptic ""Midnight Nourishment"" at 3:43 AM. The rules stated I needed to check on Mabel regularly during her second sleep cycle, but after our disturbing interaction, I was reluctant to return upstairs.

A sudden scratching sound from inside the walls made me freeze. It started faint but grew louder, more insistent—like fingernails or claws dragging against wood and plaster. I recalled Rule 11: If you hear scratching from inside the walls, recite the rhyme written on the back of this page three times. The sound should subside.

With trembling hands, I retrieved the instruction pages from the coffee table and flipped to the back where the rhyme was written:

Whisper, whisper, in the walls, What walks the night within these halls? By spoken word and candle's light, Return to shadow, flee from sight.

The scratching intensified, now coming from multiple locations—behind the fireplace, inside the ceiling, within the wall beside the staircase. It sounded like dozens of small creatures moving in unison, converging on the living room.

""Whisper, whisper, in the walls,"" I began, my voice shaking. ""What walks the night within these halls? By spoken word and candle's light, return to shadow, flee from sight.""

The scratching paused momentarily, then resumed even louder than before.

""Whisper, whisper, in the walls, what walks the night within these halls? By spoken word and candle's light, return to shadow, flee from sight.""

Again the scratching paused, longer this time. The house felt like it was holding its breath, waiting.

""Whisper, whisper, in the walls,"" I recited for the third time, more confidently now. ""What walks the night within these halls? By spoken word and candle's light, return to shadow, flee from sight.""

The scratching stopped completely, replaced by an unnerving silence so profound I could hear the blood rushing in my ears. Then, from the baby monitor, came Mabel's whispered voice:

""They don't like you, Eliza. The Others. They say you don't belong here.""

I snatched up the monitor, staring at it in horror. I hadn't pushed any buttons, hadn't activated any talk function. How could she hear me? How could she respond?

""They remember the taste of Miss Winters,"" Mabel's voice continued, the monitor crackling with static between her words. ""Sweet and afraid. Just like you.""

I dropped the monitor as if it had burned me. It hit the carpet with a soft thud, the impact switching it off momentarily before the red power light blinked back on.

The heavy antique telephone on the wall began to ring, its shrill tone cutting through the silence. I recalled Mrs. Blackwood's explicit instruction not to answer any calls, but the ringing was insistent.

On the seventh ring, it stopped abruptly, only to start again immediately. This pattern repeated three times before the house fell silent once more.

I needed to check on Mabel—the rules were explicit about regular monitoring during her second sleep cycle—but every instinct warned me against returning upstairs. Perhaps I could just listen at her door without actually entering?

As I debated my options, a new sound emerged—a soft, melodic humming coming from the dining room. I followed the sound cautiously, finding the room exactly as I'd left it, except for one detail: all eight dining chairs had been pulled away from the table and now faced the entrance, arranged in a semicircle as if for an audience.

The humming stopped the moment I entered, replaced by the distinct sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor directly above me—in Mabel's room.

I looked up at the ceiling, heart pounding. According to the rules, Mabel should not leave her bed during her second sleep cycle. Was she rearranging furniture? Was someone else in the house?

The dragging sound stopped, followed by a heavy thud that shook dust from the ornate chandelier overhead. Then came the unmistakable sound of children's laughter—not just one child, but many.

I had to check. Whatever my fears, I was responsible for Mabel's safety. I climbed the stairs cautiously, the old wood creaking beneath my feet despite my attempt to move silently. The hallway on the second floor was darker than before, the ambient light seemingly absorbed by the shadows gathering at both ends of the corridor.

Outside Mabel's door, I paused to listen. Silence. Not even the strange breathing I'd heard earlier.

I knocked softly. ""Mabel? Are you okay in there?""

No response.

Steeling myself, I turned the handle and pushed the door open a crack, peering into the candlelit room. The four-poster bed stood in the center exactly as before, but it was empty—the covers thrown back, the impression of Mabel's small body still visible in the mattress.

I pushed the door wider, scanning the room for any sign of her. The candles still burned on the dresser, their flames perfectly still despite the draft from the open door. The music box sat silent. The leather-bound book remained on the nightstand.

The only thing out of place was the large, ornate trunk that now stood at the foot of the bed—carved from dark wood and bound with iron straps, it looked ancient and impossibly heavy. It hadn't been there during my first visit to the room.

""Mabel?"" I called softly, stepping fully into the room while maintaining the minimum three-foot distance from the bed as specified in Rule 9. ""Where are you? You're supposed to be in bed.""

A soft giggle came from behind me, near the doorway I'd just entered. I spun around to find nothing there—just the empty hallway beyond the open door.

""Mabel, this isn't funny. Please come back to bed.""

Another giggle, this time from the closet on the far side of the room. The door was ajar, darkness spilling from the small opening.

I approached cautiously, hyperaware of the rules I might be breaking. The Blackwoods hadn't specified what to do if Mabel left her bed during her second sleep cycle. Was I supposed to coax her back? Leave her alone? Call the emergency number?

As I reached for the closet door, the heavy wooden trunk at the foot of the bed creaked open behind me. I whirled around to see the lid rising slowly, as if pushed from within.

""Eliza,"" came Mabel's whisper from inside the trunk. ""I found where they keep the Others.""

I backed away, unsure which was worse—approaching the trunk or allowing whatever was inside to emerge on its own.

""Mabel, please come out and get back in bed. Your parents left specific instructions—""

""Parents?"" Another giggle, this time from under the bed. ""Is that what they told you they were?""

Something was very wrong. The voice sounded like Mabel's, but it seemed to be coming from multiple locations simultaneously. And no child, no matter how agile, could move from the trunk to under the bed without me seeing them.

""The trunk,"" the voice continued, now coming from the closet again. ""Look inside the trunk, Eliza. See what happens to babysitters who break the rules.""

Against every instinct for self-preservation, I edged toward the trunk, which now stood fully open. I needed to see if Mabel was actually inside.

I peered over the edge into the trunk's dark interior.

Empty.

No, not empty—something lay at the bottom, partially hidden by shadow. I leaned closer, squinting in the dim candlelight.

A nametag. The kind worn by service workers, with a name printed in faded blue letters: ""Jessica Winters.""

A chill ran through me as I recalled Mabel's earlier question: ""Would you like to see what happened to Miss Winters?""

The trunk slammed shut with such force that I jumped back, narrowly avoiding smashed fingers. Childish laughter erupted from all corners of the room simultaneously, rising in pitch and intensity until it became almost painfully shrill.

""Mabel, stop this!"" I demanded, trying to sound authoritative despite my growing terror. ""Come out right now!""

The laughter cut off abruptly. In the sudden silence, I heard movement from beneath the bed—a shuffling, dragging sound like something pulling itself across the floor.

A small, pale hand emerged from under the bed frame, followed by another. Not a child's hands—the fingers were too long, the joints bent at unnatural angles. The hands gripped the carpet, pulling forward to reveal thin arms mottled with bruise-like markings, then a head of long black hair that fell forward, concealing the face.

I backed toward the door as the figure continued its grotesque emergence. It moved like a broken marionette, limbs jerking and twisting as it pulled itself upright at the foot of the bed.

""Eliza,"" it whispered, still facing away from me. ""Do you want to play hide and seek? Miss Winters played with me. She hid for days before the Others found her.""

The figure's head began to turn, the movement unnaturally fluid, as if its neck contained too many vertebrae.

I didn't wait to see its face. I bolted from the room, slamming the door behind me and racing down the hallway. The childish laughter resumed, now seeming to come from inside the walls themselves, following me as I fled downstairs.

In the living room, I grabbed my phone and keys, ready to abandon the job and the house entirely. But as I turned toward the front door, I froze.

The dining room chairs—all eight of them—had been moved again. They now formed a circle in the center of the living room, and seated in each one was a child-sized silhouette made of what looked like twisted shadows. They sat perfectly still, featureless heads turned toward me.

""The Others,"" I whispered, remembering Rule 12: Should Mabel ask about ""The Others,"" change the subject immediately and notify us upon our return.

As one, the shadow children raised their arms, pointing toward the staircase behind me. I didn't need to turn around to know what I would see—Mabel, or whatever was pretending to be Mabel, descending the steps.

The front door was past the circle of chairs and their occupants. I could make a run for it, but something told me these shadow children could move much faster than they appeared, that their stillness was temporary, a predator's pause before striking.

My phone buzzed in my hand—a text message had finally gone through. Nan had responded: ""What's wrong? Need me to call someone?""

Before I could reply, the phone went dead, its screen fading to black despite being almost fully charged. In the same moment, every light in the house extinguished, plunging the room into darkness broken only by the faint moonlight filtering through the curtained windows.

Rule 13: In case of power failure, use only the matches and candles provided in the kitchen drawer marked ""Emergency."" Do not use flashlights or battery-powered devices.

I had no choice but to follow the rules. It was that or face whatever waited in the darkness—Mabel, the Others, or something worse.

Feeling my way along the wall, I made it to the kitchen and found the drawer labeled ""Emergency"" by touch. Inside were matches and thick black candles unlike the white ones in Mabel's room. I struck a match with trembling fingers and lit one of the candles.

The flame flickered to life. But the candle's light revealed something I hadn't noticed before—symbols drawn on the kitchen floor in what looked like salt or white sand, forming an intricate pattern around the central island.

Similar to the ""protective boundary"" of salt mentioned in Mabel's care instructions. But this was larger, more complex, with angular glyphs at key points in the design.

As I studied the pattern, a new sound came  from the darkened house, like someone walking with a cane or staff. It moved from the living room toward the kitchen.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

1jbw4xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jbw4xj/sey_aiden_results/,Sey + Aiden results,"I'm far less sophisticated than other posters on this board, but I had a ton of questions about Sey/Sey style coffee, grinds and how to set up Aiden. What I have noticed over the past 6 months are a few things that have really developed the flavor. I also follow the Sey water recipe, which is half a packed of the third wave with distilled water. I just use super cheap amazon basics filters. 

1. Larger brew batches, like 30 ounces plus. Makes a huge difference. I haven't gone above 39 ounces yet, and that's mainly due to not being able to safely drink more but I might try 45 just to see. 

2. For Aiden I use the Fellow Drops Burundi profile for Aiden. More precisely I copied that profile, named it Sey since drops profiles self delete after a month or two. 

3. I grind larger, e.g. a 10 for Ode 2 w/ SSB or Timemore. There was a link on Fellow mentioning increased grind sizes for larger batches. I might try a 45 ounce with an even larger grind soon? 

4. I rest the coffee for as long as possible. Since we have a prepaid 6 x 250, it's running 1-2 months before they get opened, so it's mainly just a matter of what happens rather than doing anything out of the ordinary. To get more coffee and experiment more I might buy a 6 month La Cabra. 

5. I have not tinkered with the brew profiles. If Fellow has another drop with a similar coffee roast to Sey soon I might switch up, and I'm sure there will be loads of Nordic style drops soon. 

The coffee is way better than what I started with, which was a fine grind, (between 4-5 on an Ode 2), smaller brew sizes like 16 ounces and a ""light"" roast profile on the Aiden. Like WAY better and I do not consider myself to have a delicate or refined nose. 

It's a slow process, but this is making great coffee and a significant improvement from when I started. ",7,1742048414.0,pourover,0,0.9,False

I normally have things with strong flavors.  I love coffee.  I have spicy, salty, and sweet food all the time.  As a child, I always had my tea with sugar and honey.  I'm trying to understand tea culture more, as plain tea was always sickening for me as a child.  I never understood how people could like something so flavorless.  Well, I think I've discovered it actually does have flavor for most people... just not for me.

Now, I will say I love bubble/boba milk tea.  The milk makes it sweet, and I love the texture of the tapioca peals, having something to chew on.

I think there are two main reasons why I'm bored with tea.  First, it's currently flavorless for me.  It just tastes like hot water with some subtle flavors I can notice, but not enough to make it feel substantially different from hot water.  I don't think quality is the issue.  I've been to Taiwan and have tried tea lovers' homemade tea, plenty of tea shops' professionally made teas, and tea made in my own home using either bags or loose leaf.  I've tried green tea, white tea, black tea, rooibos tea, fruit flavored teas, etc.  I usually make tea with bottled water already, and I use an electric kettle.

The only teas I've come close to enjoying (besides the sweetened ones) were a special brand of rooibos tea that had a cinnamon taste, as well as chai tea.  Although, I suspect the chai tea I had might've also been sweetened.

Secondly, I think it's also the lack of texture.  Even when I drink coffee, particularly Turkish coffee, I love feeling the coffee grounds in my mouth.  When I drink boba tea, I love the tapioca pearls.  Generally, when I drink tea, there's not much texture to work with.

So here are my questions to hopefully help me enjoy tea more.  Even though it's very clear that I just don't like tea, it's a mission of mine to enjoy tea more since I'll be moving to Taiwan soon.  I'm hoping someone can answer my questions or impart me with some knowledge that helped them go from hating tea to actually enjoying it and understanding the appeal, because I just feel so lost.

1. Does everyone have any advice on trying to train themselves to **notice more subtle flavors**?  I've noticed a lot of the food I tried in Shanghai tasted completely bland to me, whereas other people could pickup on the flavors.  I have a feeling that my taste buds just aren't as sensitive compared to other people, perhaps due to the strong flavors I'm regularly exposed to.  Can I train myself to notice more subtle flavors while enjoying the process?  For example, partially sweetening my tea with something, and reducing the quantity over time until I can taste the tea by itself? --- perhaps I could hear some suggestions for the more flavorful teas, and work myself down from the more flavorful ones to the more subtle ones.  Bear in mind that even the fruit flavored teas are unenjoyable for me right now.  I can notice a slight change in flavor, but it's still basically hot water to me.
2. Is there anything anyone recommends adding to tea to make it (slightly) more **flavorful** besides purely honey or sugar?  I love cinnamon, but I think it might be a little too powerful a flavor.  I want something to enjoy the tea more, but not overpower the natural flavor, because the goal is to one day learn to enjoy the tea by itself.    The flavor doesn't even need to be sweet.  I just want some kind of flavor to focus on, even if it's sour or bitter or astringent.  Hot water is just too boring for me, and that's the only taste I can pick up on right now.
3. Is there anything I can add to the tea (or any particular tea I can choose) to give it some **texture**?  Any particular types of loose leaf tea I can use that have ingredients that are **meant** to fall into the tea and be swallowed?  Or teas that tend to have more ingredients that fall into the tea?  Or anything I can add myself to give the tea some texture, even if it's as simple as making the tea thicker somehow?
4. For those of you who had the same problem, hating tea, finding it too boring when you first started, what (if anything) transformed your perspective to help you truly enjoy your tea?  Was the taste acquired over time?  Was it a certain type of tea or way of making it?",1,1742048346.0,tea,28,0.6,False

1jbw379,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1jbw379/us_starbucks_baristas_please_help/,"[US] Starbucks Baristas, Please Help","I usually go grab a coffee before I go work, and I was wondering what the appropriate/good tip is from the perspective of a barista. Until recently I didn't get coffee much so I was just using a rule of thumb I do breweries, which is to tip $1 a beer. Same with bars, unless it's a more involved drink, then I'll do $2. This is if I'm only getting drinks. If I get food and alcohol, I just tip around 20% of the tab and call it a day.

My drink is $6.02 so $1 is around 18% but I know some people say lower tabs should be a flat minimum not a percentage.

If any baristas have an opinion I am interested in hearing it. Baristas only please, and I am pro-tipping and will never change my mind about that, so please no arguments about tipping in general. It's fine if you're anti-tipping, you can choose to not tip and I am not judging you for that but I also don't want to get into an argument about it. What does a Starbucks barista consider a good tip?

Gotta start somewhere right. But don't worry, I know how to keep a conversation going. Just please be an adult.

I have all sorts of interests but I guess my main ones would be reading, being outdoors, watching the occasional show and playing the occasional video game, but those are usually single-player ones. Also enjoy learning about different places all over the world, especially any strange lore that is geographical based.

So feel free to drop me a line, I'm up for anything from simple chit chat to deeper conversation. Hope to hear from some of you soon!",0,1742048183.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,0.5,False

One day, honestly in jest, I presented her with my coffee cup with very warm fresh coffee with milk and sugar(not even half a tbs). To my surprise she actually gulped it down! Beak fulls... Due to that reaction I'm thinking this wasn't her first coffee 😅 I adore her and love this moment we get to share. I only allow three dips. Unsure of how much coffee that is! 
Is Kelsie alone in her love of coffee? Is it because its warm? The sugar? Should I not be sharing? I read parrots like tea, should I make her her own cup?
