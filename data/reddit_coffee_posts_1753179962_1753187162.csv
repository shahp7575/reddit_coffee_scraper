1m6cm4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m6cm4s/can_you_go_to_secret_island_in_oahu/,Can you go to Secret Island in Oahu?,"Just got back from exploring Secret Island in Oahu, and I wanted to share my experience since I see this question pop up a lot. The short answer is yes - but there's a catch.

Secret Island isn't actually a separate island, but rather a secluded beach area that's part of Kualoa Ranch on Oahu's windward coast. The only way to access it is through an authorized tour, as it's on private property.

I recently took the Circle Island Tour which included a stop near Kualoa Ranch where we got amazing views of the area. While we didn't go to Secret Island itself (it requires a separate booking), we saw plenty of equally stunning spots along the way. The tour took us around the entire island, showing both famous landmarks and hidden gems that most tourists miss.

What really impressed me was Waimea Valley. The waterfall there is just as picturesque as anything you'd find at Secret Island, and you can actually swim in it. The botanical gardens surrounding it are incredible - I probably took hundreds of photos just there.

One thing I learned is that many ""secret"" spots in Oahu are either on private property or can be dangerous to access without a guide. That's why I highly recommend booking through a reputable tour company. After researching extensively, I found this Circle Island Tour (https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island) that covers all the major highlights while keeping everything safe and legal.

The tour includes stops at:
- Diamond Head lookout
- Halona Blowhole
- North Shore beaches
- Waimea Valley and Waterfall
- Dole Plantation
- Several other spots I probably would've missed on my own

Pro tip: While Secret Island might be exclusive, the Circle Island Tour actually gives you more bang for your buck. You get to see multiple locations, learn about Hawaiian culture from local guides, and even try some amazing local treats (the Kona coffee and macadamia nut tastings were highlights).

For anyone planning to visit Oahu, I'd suggest booking the tour early in your trip. It helps you get oriented with the island and discover places you might want to revisit later. The guides also share great recommendations for local restaurants and activities.

Bottom line: While Secret Island is beautiful, there are many equally stunning locations around Oahu that are more accessible. The Circle Island Tour is honestly the best way to experience them all in one day. Just make sure to bring your camera, swimming gear, and some cash for lunch - the North Shore garlic shrimp trucks are a must-try!",1,1753186902.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

1m6cl0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1m6cl0o/my_friends_ignored_me_for_a_year_and_then_jumped/,"My friends ignored me for a year, and then jumped me with complaints. Should I try and reconnect?","In my (20F) first year at university, I made close friends with two girls (both also 20F) who lived in my flat. We hung out basically every day, both casually and on big hikes/ nights out.  None of us are from the area, so it felt like I had found a new family here. The three of us decided to move in together for second year. 

At the start everything was fine. We were all busier, but we had a couple movie nights and everything was friendly. The second half of the year though, it was like something flipped and I was just an extra in our house. 

One of them (Carla) would never talk to me, and often brush me off if we weren’t talking about something to do with the house. The other (Maria) was friendly, but when I suggested something we should do together the plans never happened. I figured they were just busy (Maria is a med student with a part time job, and I guessed that Carla just had a low social battery), but the two of them always managed to find time to hang out with other friends or together without inviting me. All the time they were doing things they know I’d love to do without even asking me to come. It didn’t always feel innocent, as often I would ask what plans they have for the week and they would leave out key details that would show that they were going together. When I did ‘catch’ them, I tried to be chill about it. My mum told me to just stay non-confrontational, and say ‘that sounds fun! I would have loved to have gone/ invite me next time!’ Lightheartedly. I did that, it didn’t make any difference. 

The worst example of this was a day we had a heatwave, and I wanted to go to the beach. I asked them, Carla said no and Maria said maybe. Because I didn’t want to wait around, I went to the beach with my boyfriend and some of our friends came for an hour or two, then left. I asked Maria over and over again if she was going to come join us with no exact response. Eventually it was clear she wasn’t coming so I packed up and went home. Later on, I found out that an hour before I left the beach the two of them went to a different beach nearby without even saying anything. Their excuse was that it was ‘spontaneous’. 

A week before we were supposed to move out of our house, I got desperate and told them we only had a week before summer, so we should at least walk around the park or get coffee. Carla, who had barely been speaking to me, initially said yes, but then changed her mind.  She said she’d rather deep clean the house. Me and Maria went for coffee, but she only had 10 minutes to spare before work. On the way to the cafe, I expressed how I had felt the last 6 months. I asked if I had done something bad or if it was just natural distance.  All that she said back to me was that we’ve all had “communication issues”. 

The next day, Carla asked if we could talk about moving out stuff. I went downstairs and they sat me down and asked me if I had anything I wanted to say. It felt like an interrogation. I just repeated the same thing I said to Maria the day before, and Carla just went off at me. She said she wasn’t going to mince words, because she is a very direct person. 

She said I was loud and self obsessed, that I only talk about myself and never ask them about what’s going on with them. She said that she figured if she stopped listening to me I would realise what I had done and start being a better friend. Maria didn’t really say much, but just sort of nodded along in support. Carla also said that at the start of the year, I was always hanging out with other people, and they were not a priority. This felt a bit hypocritical to me, as all three of us have always had extracurriculars and friends outside of this group, but that was about the time I started dating my boyfriend and was trying to get to know his friends, so maybe I didn’t realise how distant I was.  

I can think about it critically now, but in the moment I was so blindsided that i just listened and apologised profusely, telling them I had no idea. I felt really guilty for a couple days, but I didn’t really know how to repair it since I had 3 days before they both left for the summer, and Carla was still pretty distant. 

I can get that maybe i actually did these things, and I think that they’re valid things to complain about when you live with someone. I know I can talk a lot and have a problem with volume, I am neurodivergent and can go on a tangent often, but has ever told me I am a bad friend like this. The thing that irritates me about all of this is that I had no idea what I had done wrong and they never brought it up to me until now, when I can’t really do anything about their opinions of me. It feels really irritating to me that it came up in this way instead of a more constructive conversation. I felt like my feelings of being excluded were also just swept to the side, and I didn’t really get an apology. Carla moved out of the house that week, and the only thing she said to me the day she left was that I owe her money and I should send it to her. 

When I told my family, who I had been venting to about this, they defended me. My sister thinks that they said it in an emotionally insensitive way, and they had been immature to respond like that, even if they were valid feelings. My hometown best friend got mad that they decided to say this only now when the damage is done, he said that I don’t want those kind of people as friends if they’re going to act like that. Either way, it really knocked my social confidence and made me feel awful about this relationship that felt so perfect the year before. 

Now I don’t know what to do. My boyfriend thinks I should give it some time and then try to reconnect with them after summer. Part of me wants to just leave it and move on with other friendships. Knowing Carla, if I do nothing she will go on with her life and never reach out to me. Maria might speak to me next year, but she is the busiest of the two and meeting up will be difficult. I don’t know if I even want to bother ‘proving’ myself to them, the dynamic doesn’t feel equal now. The nail in the coffin for me was that Maria just posted an Instagram dump of all her photos of the last year, and it’s just picture after picture of trips and events of them together which I was never invited to. Either way, I don’t think we’ll ever be as close again as I thought we were. ",0,1753186820.0,TwoHotTakes,2,0.5,False
1m6cih5,https://i.redd.it/wur60qzw3fef1.jpeg,Ranking All Avvatar Whey Protein Flavours (Based on 4 Years of Use),"Hey folks! I've been using Avvatar Whey for the past 4 years, and thought I’d help some of you decide which flavour to pick. I’ve tried almost all of them, and here’s my honest ranking.
Note: I always mix my whey with milk, never water and I recommend keeping some unflavoured whey handy in case you want to tone down the sweetness.

1. Malai Kulfi (10/10)
The OG and evergreen flavour from Avvatar. It legit tastes like a chilled Indian dessert, especially good with some crushed dry fruits added. It’s sweet, creamy, and super refreshing. Feels like you’re having dessert, not a protein shake. Highly recommended.

2. Cold Coffee (8/10)
A banger of a flavour from their new Performance Whey line. Tastes just like real cold coffee, with a slight bitter aftertaste, probably because they’ve used real coffee powder (nice touch!).
BUT... they’ve added salt for some reason (??), which knocks it down a couple of points. Still solid overall.

3. Mango Rush (6/10)
Decent, but very context dependent. Tastes great with curd (basically a mango lassi vibe), but in milk it’s a bit weird. With water, it turns into a fake mango toffee taste, not pleasant. Worth trying if you mix it with dahi.

4. Belgian Chocolate (0/10)
The biggest letdown. I don’t know how you mess up chocolate, but Avvatar found a way.
It smells bad, tastes worse, and honestly made me gag. Still, I finished the 2KG pack

Let me know if you've tried any of these and agree (or disagree). Would love to hear what others think! ",1,1753186615.0,AskFitnessIndia,0,1.0,False
1m6ci7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrowdDiagnosis/comments/1m6ci7i/any_guesses/,Any guesses?,"Let me begin by stating that I have visited every kind of doctor imaginable — general practitioners, cardiologists, vascular specialists, sports medicine doctors, and so on — and nobody has yet been able to figure out what’s going on with me.

Three years ago, I was an elite-level mountain biker in excellent shape (30 years old at the time). The day before my life turned upside down, I did my usual training ride — a pretty intense workout. After completing the ride, I experienced some sharp pain in my upper left chest and arm. It was brief but concerning. I chalked it up to overtraining and figured I just needed some rest.

The next day, I had a constant aching pain throughout my upper left arm and chest that persisted throughout my workday. When I got home, everything seemed normal. I sat down to eat dinner, and shortly after starting, my heart rate skyrocketed and continued climbing well above 200 bpm. I nearly lost consciousness but managed to stabilize myself by hunching over, which brought my heart rate down below 200. However, it remained elevated for the rest of the night.

The following day, every time I stood up — especially from a seated position — my heart rate would spike. I spent almost two days in bed, completely exhausted. On the third day, I went to the doctor. They ran an EKG, and while my pulse was unusually high, there were no abnormalities in heart rhythm. They outfitted me with a monitor, and although it showed the heart rate spikes, no cause was evident.

I was put on beta blockers. They helped somewhat, but I still struggled with standing or any change in blood flow, which caused spikes in heart rate. Interestingly, I felt okay during workouts — it was only during the “come down” afterward that problems arose. As my heart tried to return to a resting rate, it would drop below 70 bpm momentarily, then shoot back up and stay elevated for hours.

Eventually, I saw a cardiologist. More tests showed the same pattern: the heart itself looked fine, but I had clear issues with blood flow regulation. I was switched to a different, slow-release beta blocker, which helped immensely. I also began a physical therapy program.

During PT, I would go in spurts — making some progress, then having flare-ups, especially when I got sick or experienced too much up-and-down movement. These setbacks could undo weeks of progress. It became a constant yo-yo effect. Eventually, I gave up working out altogether, and ironically, that’s when I began to see real healing.

Now, I feel as “normal” as I can during a typical workday. I can do very minimal, low-effort workouts, but I’ve stayed away from anything strenuous for months. I feel like I’m improving, but at an absolute snail’s pace.

I saw a vascular specialist who ruled out thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), and a sports medicine doctor examined an old broken collarbone. They ruled out vagus nerve impingement.

Previously, caffeine would bring back the arm and outer chest pain — even a small amount — but now, three years on, I can have a cup of coffee in the morning and afternoon.

Eating large meals, especially carbs, used to cause heart rate spikes, but I can now eat mostly normally. I’m making progress, but I’m still nowhere near where I was before. If I get sick or sleep poorly, I still experience flare-ups. For the most part, though, they are far less intense than before — but a full flare-up can take a week or more to fully recover from.

The prevailing theory is that this could be a symptom of long COVID. About three months before the onset, I had COVID. My symptoms were mild at the time, and I was back on my bike shortly after quarantine. The virus might have flared up and triggered this cascade of issues — at least, that’s the best guess.

I’ve been given the long hauler/POTS diagnosis, though my cardiologist believes those are symptoms of something deeper.

As it stands today, I’m much better off than I was three, two, or even one year ago. While I doubt I’ll ever return to my old self, I’m still hoping for more answers. If anyone has experienced something similar or has any insight, I’d greatly appreciate hearing it.",1,1753186591.0,CrowdDiagnosis,0,1.0,False

1m6chcw,https://i.redd.it/zdx421om3fef1.jpeg,Finest Playa Mujeres 7/22/25,"If you’re like me you over-researched and may have started second guessing your upcoming trip to FPM. For every great review of ANY resort I found another one trashing it and calling the positive reviewers shills.  I’m here currently with my two teenage kids, 14, 16.  This place is absolutely amazing! The grounds are immaculate and stunning.  Somehow the pictures don’t do it justice.  The service is 10/10.  There is zero sea grass.  We are on day 6 of a 7 night vacation. We lucked out I guess and have had nothing but sun. I felt compelled to write this to hopefully ease anyone who is stressing like I was.  It is a lot of money to spend so I understand and I try to do my research.  I am 100% not a shill in any way and was in no way asked by anyone to write this. 

We stayed in the family pool view room. I tried to upgrade to the swim up because those pictures of the hammocks look so cool.  No luck, the resort was at 80% capacity all week although it did not feel crowded .  I’m glad I didn’t though. We are more than happy with our room and I didn’t need to spend that money.  

I have been to a bunch of AIs and a few cruises and am pretty well traveled. This place is hands down the nicest I’ve been to. It is quiet and peaceful, which is what I was looking for.  If you want a bass thumping party scene with an enormous pool, this isn’t it. There is a lively section with an adults only side and swim up bar and a mirror image family side and swim up bar.  That section is fun and my only criticism is that, if this is your speed, there are limited pool chairs in section.  The property is large and the pools that line each building felt like we had the place to ourselves every day and the service by Nery and her team was incredible.  Drinks, food (in the afternoon) delivered to your pool chair, fresh cut coconuts (cocos) at the pool bar. I also read a review of a scarcity of pool and beach chairs, which is my nightmare on vacation. I was on a Norwegian cruise and watched people fist fighting over chairs and my kids and I having a 2’ section of bench by the pool. That’s not the case at all here. Unless you want to sit by the swim up bars or if you want to go to the beach and try to cruise down at noon.  I do the beach every morning at sunrise and I’m the only one here. It’s now 7 am and there are maybe 5 people plus the guy driving the beachcomber tractor. This beach is immaculate. There are ALWAYS plenty of pool chairs at the pools by our room. 

Ok.  The food was pretty good for an AI.  We did not have club level access. Brass was amazing 9/10, service 11/10. I recommend the hibachi, the only place you need a reservation 7/10. Dukes was pretty good for breakfast and lunch, we did not do dinner here 6.5/10. Italian and Mexican were our least favorite but still not bad 5/10. We did the buffet breakfast that was better than most AIs and the omelette bar was really good.  Also, the Sweet Corner is the spot to get Coffee and (you guessed it) sweets.  
Edith was there with a smile taking great care of us every day but one. They all work 6 days a week here. 

We did also have a medical emergency. My daughter got a bad ear infection. She woke up in a lot of pain. I needed to call the 24/7 on-site DR.  She came to our room within 20 minutes. Prescribed her antibiotics which she then went out to town to bring back for us.  This is a 3rd party service and we were charged $250 (I think because it was after hours 5am) I was told normally $180 plus medication which was $130 for ear drops and amoxicillin.  The doctor was incredibly kind and compassionate.  I’ll try and submit to my insurance when I get stateside but who knows how that will go. 

Anyway, I’m here watching the sunrise on another perfect day here and thought I owed it to the kind people who are doing what I was doing leading up to this to share my experience. I will 100% be coming back here. This place and the people working here have a special place in our hearts. Anyone complaining that the food isn’t five star or that there are children at a family resort or whatever have unrealistic expectations and, after being here, I can say probably aren’t that fun to be around 😂

TLDR 
Don’t believe the negative reviews. This place is truly amazing. Stunningly beautiful grounds and stellar service. ",2,1753186524.0,cancun,1,1.0,False
1m6cfmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apexinsights/comments/1m6cfmr/title_just_moved_to_a_new_city_and_feeling/,Title: Just moved to a new city and feeling overwhelmed - any tips?,"Hey everyone! I just relocated to Portland for a new job and I'm honestly feeling pretty lost. It's my first time living somewhere where I don't know a single person, and everything feels so different from my small hometown.

**Things I'm struggling with:**
- Finding good local coffee shops that aren't too crowded in the mornings
- Making friends as an adult - seriously, how do people do this?
- Navigating the public transit system without looking like a complete tourist
- Finding a decent grocery store that doesn't cost a fortune
- Understanding the unwritten social rules of the city

**My plan so far:**
1. Join a local hiking group since I love being outdoors
2. Check out some community events at the library
3. Try to strike up conversations with neighbors (terrifying but necessary)
4. Explore different neighborhoods on weekends
5. Maybe take a cooking class or something similar

# Best Ultrasonic Speakers 2025: Reviews & How to Choose

Ultrasonic speakers are a cutting-edge technology that utilizes high-frequency sound waves,beyond the range of human hearing,to transmit audible sound in a focused direction. Unlike customary speakers that disperse sound in all directions, ultrasonic speakers exploit the principle of non-linear acoustics to create a ""virtual"" sound source in the air. This means that only a person standing directly in the path of the ultrasonic beam will hear the intended audio,making them ideal for applications requiring targeted sound delivery. The increasing demand for privacy, personalized audio experiences, adn interactive digital signage is driving rapid innovation in this space, making the selection process overwhelming for consumers. This review aims to guide you through the best ultrasonic speakers of 2025 and provide the necessary knowledge to make an informed purchase.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of an ultrasonic speaker hinges on its capacity to produce and manipulate high-frequency sound waves. Several key features contribute to overall performance.**Transducer Frequency:** The core of an ultrasonic speaker is its transducer, which generates the ultrasonic waves.

Transducers operate at frequencies far beyond human hearing, typically ranging from 40 kHz to over 200 kHz. Higher frequencies allow for tighter beamforming, resulting in a more focused and directional sound output. However, increasing the frequency also increases the air's absorption of the ultrasonic waves, thus reducing the range of the speaker. A well-designed speaker finds a balance between frequency and range, optimizing both beamforming and audibility.

**Modulation Technique:** Amplitude Modulation (AM) or Frequency modulation (FM) is crucial in transferring the desired audio signal onto the ultrasonic carrier wave.

AM is the simpler method, where the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied according to the input audio signal. While easy to implement, AM can be more susceptible to distortion as the ultrasonic wave travels through the air. FM is a more elegant technique where the frequency of the carrier wave is altered. FM generally offers better audio quality and is less prone to distortions. The choice of modulation technique impacts the overall sound fidelity delivered to the listener.

**Beamforming Technology:** Ultrasonic speakers use beamforming to focus sound in a narrow direction.

beamforming is the process of shaping the ultrasonic waves into a concentrated beam, directing the sound to a specific area. This is achieved through precisely arranged transducers, which work together to constructively interfere at the desired location while destructively interfering elsewhere. Some advanced speakers even use dynamic beamforming, allowing the direction of the sound to be electronically steered in real-time. A sharp, well-defined beam is essential in preventing sound leakage and maximizing the privacy of the audio experience.

**Input Audio Formats:** The versatility of an ultrasonic speaker is enhanced by the variety of audio formats it can process.

Support for common audio formats such as MP3, WAV, AAC, and FLAC ensures that the speaker can seamlessly integrate with various devices and media players. Some models also incorporate Bluetooth connectivity,allowing for wireless audio streaming from smartphones,tablets,and laptops. Compatibility with a wide range of input formats prevents the need for format conversions and simplifies the user experience.

**power Consumption:** as with any electronic device, power consumption is an essential consideration.

Ultrasonic speakers vary in power requirements depending on thier size, output power, and beamforming capabilities. Lower power consumption translates into energy savings and reduced operating costs. Manufacturers strive to optimize their designs to minimize power usage without compromising performance. Pay attention to the power rating and consider energy-efficient models, especially in applications where the speaker is used continuously.

## Core Benefits

Ultrasonic speakers offer distinct advantages over traditional speakers, making them suitable for a growing range of applications.

**Enhanced Privacy:** The unique characteristic of focused sound projection leads to enhanced privacy settings.

Ultrasonic speakers direct sound in a narrow beam, meaning only individuals directly in the beam's path can hear the audio. This is highly beneficial in settings where confidentiality is paramount, such as office spaces, libraries, or museums. Details shared through an ultrasonic speaker is kept private, preventing eavesdropping and distractions for those outside the targeted area.

**Targeted Advertising:** Retail Environments can benefit from the use of targeted marketing.

In retail environments, ultrasonic speakers can be used to deliver targeted advertisements directly to shoppers who are in proximity to specific products or displays. This personalized approach can increase engagement and boost sales without annoying other customers. Imagine walking past a shelf of coffee makers and hearing a brief audio clip about a specific model's features.

**Interactive Digital Signage:** Create new interactive user experiences.

By integrating ultrasonic speakers with digital signage, it is indeed possible to create interactive experiences that respond to a user's location or actions. For example,a museum visitor standing in front of a painting might hear a detailed description of the artwork,while another visitor nearby remains undisturbed. This enhances the educational value of the signage and allows for a more immersive experience.

**Reduced Noise Pollution:** Less disruptive than traditional speaker systems.

Unlike conventional speakers that emit sound in all directions, ultrasonic speakers minimize noise pollution by concentrating sound in a focused area. This is especially vital in noise-sensitive environments, such as hospitals, classrooms, and open-plan offices. Clear dialog is achieved without causing interference or distractions to others in the vicinity.

## FAQs Section

**What are the primary applications of ultrasonic speakers?**

Ultrasonic speakers find applications in various fields,including targeted advertising,digital signage,museums,libraries,office spaces,and home entertainment systems. They are particularly useful where focused audio delivery and privacy are required.

**Are ultrasonic speakers safe for human hearing?**

Yes, ultrasonic speakers are generally considered safe as humans cannot hear the ultrasonic frequencies they produce. The audible sound is created through demodulation of the ultrasonic carrier wave. However,prolonged exposure to high-intensity ultrasonic frequencies may have potential health effects,so it is essential to use these speakers responsibly and adhere to manufacturer guidelines.**What factors should I consider when choosing an ultrasonic speaker?**

When selecting an ultrasonic speaker, consider factors such as the intended submission, sound quality, range, beamwidth, input audio formats, and power consumption. Also, evaluate the build quality and reliability of the speaker, as well as customer reviews and warranty information.

Overall, our relationship is good, he’s supportive, funny, and we have similar life goals. But I’ve been struggling with how sensitive I am to his teasing.

Yesterday morning, I woke up feeling anxious and tired. I was running late for work, spilled coffee on my top, and just felt gross. As I was about to leave, he looked at me and said, You’re going out like that? in a half joking, half serious tone. I immediately felt awful. I changed clothes, wiped my smudged makeup, and left feeling embarrassed. All day at work, I kept thinking about what he said and feeling self conscious.

Later that night, he FaceTimed me and told me I looked beautiful and he missed me. I asked him about what he said that morning, and he just laughed it off and said, You’re so dramatic, I was teasing you. You always look cute. I grew up with very critical parents, so small comments about my appearance make me spiral. I know he doesn’t mean to hurt me, and I don’t want him to feel like he can’t joke with me at all. I just want him to understand that certain comments impact me deeply, especially when I’m already feeling down.

I want to communicate this to him in a way that helps him understand without feeling attacked or defensive. I also want to work on not letting these things ruin my whole day.

My question is, How can I express to him that these teasing comments about my appearance really affect me, in a way that leads to a productive conversation and healthier communication between us?

After a few days of chatting, we decided to meet up IRL for a coffee date. I was excited but also a tad nervous... you know how it is. 

Anyway, I show up at this cute little cafe he suggested, and guess what? He had reserved the entire back patio and decorated it with fairy lights and rose petals, like a scene straight out of a rom-com. I felt kinda special and a bit like I was walking into a prom scene. 🤦‍♀️

It was one of those mildly over-the-top moments where you’re not sure whether to laugh or be flattered – so I did both. I mean, how could I not appreciate the effort? Turns out, he had an interesting story behind it. Apparently, his sister dared him to do the cheesiest romantic gesture possible because she was convinced it would either make or break the date. 

The gesture ended up being quite the conversation starter, and over the best cappuccinos I swear I've ever had, we laughed about our different 'dates from hell' experiences and bonded over the fact that if this didn’t work out, at least we’d leave with a funny story. 

By the end of the date, I think I appreciated the creativity more than anything. So yeah, maybe not my usual first date vibe, but it was refreshingly different... and tbh, it kinda worked. We'll see where it goes from here! 😂",6,1753186172.0,OnlineDatingStory,0,1.0,False

- Finding good local coffee shops that aren't too crowded in the mornings
- Making friends as an adult - seriously, how do people do this?
- Navigating the public transit system without looking like a complete tourist
- Finding a decent grocery store that doesn't cost a fortune
- Understanding the unwritten social rules of the city

1. Join a local hiking group since I love being outdoors
2. Check out some community events at the library
3. Try to strike up conversations with neighbors (terrifying but necessary)
4. Explore different neighborhoods on weekends
5. Maybe take a cooking class or something similar

I am currently residing at **Casper House, Domlur**, and have been facing **persistent issues related to billing, maintenance, and service quality**. The situation has caused significant stress and financial burden.

I have retained **all relevant documentation**, including chats, screenshots, and call recordings, to support the facts I’m sharing here. I would like to know if any of this qualifies as a consumer rights violation or warrants further legal action.

**TL;DR:Stanza Living (Casper House) runs what feels like a SCAM through a faulty smart meter system. They forced me to pay over ₹1100 in 11 days for a single room, illegally cut my power multiple times despite having a balance, and refused to provide any invoice or breakdown. The property is also filthy, with cockroaches near the drinking water and garbage piling up for days.Advertised as premium but every claim is false , TV doesn't work, Fridge isn't provided in every room ,it's a common one just for legally being correct. Whenever i tried contacting their higher ups they just keep saying working on it, JUST A MONEY MAKING SCHEME!**

# The Main Issue: The Electricity Meter

Firstly, the sales person **shabir** told me nothing about the separate electricity bill **13 rupees per unit + 15 rupees common area charge** after paying **31k per month** for single room. Secondly, this isn't just a simple billing error; it's a systematic failure that feels designed to extract money from you. Here’s how it works:

1. **Incorrect Meter Mapping:** From day one, my room (**#303**) was incorrectly mapped in their system to another room's meter (**#008**). The staff, including the Resident Captain, **Uttam**, admitted this was their fault.\[ btw the captain who checked me in left after 10 days uttam is his replacement\]
2. **Fake Negative Balance & Forced Recharges:** Because of this, my Stanza app constantly showed a massive negative balance (like -₹205), even when their own backend confirmed I had a positive balance. They would then use this fake negative balance as a pretext to cut my power. I was left without electricity multiple times, often after a long day at work, with my phone dying. My only option was to recharge.
3. **The Money Pit:** Between July 4th and July 15th, I was forced to make four separate recharges totaling **₹1,100**. For a single person in one room, this is an absurd amount.
4. **Impossible Charges & No Transparency:** When I finally got a glimpse of the ""consumption data,"" the numbers were insane. On July 5th, I was charged **₹329.17 for using just 1.09 units**. On July 10th, it was **₹303.90 for 0.3 units**. These rates are impossible. For over three weeks, I begged Uttam and the Cluster Manager, **Prakash**, for a detailed breakdown or an invoice. They kept making excuses about a ""central team"" and ""backend issues"" and **NEVER** provided a single document. They will take your money but will never be accountable for it. NOT  a single bill or invoice given to me till date

# Beyond this : The Pathetic Living Conditions

If the financial stress wasn't enough, the property itself is a health hazard. The ""premium living"" they advertise is a lie.

* **Hygiene is Non-Existent:** **Cockroaches crawling near the RO water dispenser**. The ladles for tea and coffee are left out in the open, covered in flies.
* **Garbage Everywhere:** Trash bags from other residents were left piled up in the corridors for 5-6 days straight, making the whole floor stink.
* **Failed Services:**
   * The **in-room TV never worked**. I raised a ticket for it on June 11th, and it was closed without anyone ever showing up.When asked repeatedly they told use HDMI cables with laptop
   * **Breakfast is a joke.** The service is from 7:30-9:30 AM, but essentials like bread are often gone by 8:30 AM. There’s no staff to supervise or refill anything.If someone forgets to close the lid of the food there is no one to supervise and flies start having a party.

# Management & Staff:

Don't expect any help. Escalating the issue is pointless. Better talk to a wall.

* **Uttam (Resident captain/""caretaker""):** Supposedly present to help the residents. Will listen, admit it's their fault, and then do absolutely nothing. His vocabulary is limited to ""working on it,"" ""checking with the team,"" and ""please wait."" Has the audacity to talkback to me when i repeatedly ask for updates.
* **Prakash (Manager):** Is even worse. He will not pick up calls and will give one-line, dismissive replies on WhatsApp. He'll promise to ""align someone to connect,"" but no one ever does. He is fully aware of the issues but chooses to ignore them.Typical strategy to avoid responsibility.

Deposit: Many past residents have told it won't be given dont even try asking.

1m6c6fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/the_connor_robertson/comments/1m6c6fo/most_businesses_dont_actually_have_a_marketing/,Most businesses don’t actually have a marketing problem. They have a momentum problem.,"
This is something I’ve seen again and again working with small businesses, service providers, and a bunch of scrappy entrepreneurs trying to grow something real. Everyone thinks they need more traffic, more exposure, a new funnel, a better brand. But nine times out of ten, that’s not the issue.

What they really need is something to tip over the first domino. Something that shows them their idea is working. A signal. Proof of life.

It’s crazy how often people start trying to redesign their whole brand or spend money on paid ads before they’ve even proven they have a clear message or a working offer. I’ve watched people sink thousands into Facebook and Google before they ever talked to ten real humans who might buy what they’re selling.

And I get it. I’ve done it too. It feels easier to make a logo than it does to send fifty DMs or make uncomfortable phone calls. But the real problem isn’t design or branding. It’s the fact that most people are moving in ten directions at once and not seeing traction in any of them.

So here’s what I’ve been focusing on when I help businesses cut through the noise:

Start telling real stories. Not the polished, bullet-pointed kind. Just the messy, useful ones. Most people’s content sounds like a bad press release. They say what they think sounds professional instead of saying what actually matters. When someone says “we empower businesses to succeed,” what does that even mean? If you helped a local painter double his jobs by fixing his Google Business listing, talk about that. People remember stories, not slogans.

Focus more on distribution than design. Nobody cares how pretty your Instagram is if you’re only posting once a month. Ugly content that shows up every day will outperform beautiful content that nobody sees. I’ve seen the ugliest cold emails generate six figures. I’ve seen Canva-perfect brands completely flop. If you’re not getting in front of people consistently, the design isn’t the issue.

Follow up like your life depends on it. Most leads don’t ghost you—they just forget about you. People are busy. They’re distracted. They need reminders. A friend of mine closed over $200,000 in old leads just by going back through his inbox and sending a two-sentence email: “Hey, are you still thinking about [problem]?” That’s it. No pitch deck. No sales script. Just follow-up.

Simplify the offer until it’s so clear a 5th grader could pitch it. If it takes more than one sentence to describe what you do, it’s too complicated. The best positioning I’ve ever seen sounds like something you’d say over coffee, not something you’d read on a mission statement. Something like: “We build websites for contractors so they get more calls.” Or, “We help dentists double their reviews without asking for them.” That kind of clarity wins.

The other thing I’m noticing more is how badly people want to skip the boring part. The reps. The consistency. Everyone wants a viral post or some AI tool that writes all their content, but nobody wants to write 20 bad posts before they write something that sticks. I’ve never seen anyone break through without first pushing through the dull, uncertain middle. You don’t need a better strategy—you probably just need more volume and more consistency.

I’m not here to pitch anything. Just sharing what’s been working from my side of things. I’ve been operating under the name Dr. Connor Robertson and helping a lot of businesses refine their positioning, clean up their message, and build momentum. That word keeps coming back to me—momentum. Because once you feel it, everything gets easier. The conversations flow. The leads make sense. You stop questioning the business every two weeks. And your confidence builds faster than your ad budget ever could.

Anyway, I’m curious—what’s been working for your business lately? What have you tried that totally flopped? I’m always looking to learn from others in the trenches too. Let’s hear it.",1,1753185640.0,the_connor_robertson,0,1.0,False

I couldn't wake up early and by myself because our 60 or so year old apartment has walls made out of paper and will transfer any noise I make in the kitchen right to the bedroom where my mom sleeps. She complains about it and I don't want to listen to her insulting me anymore,so I just woke up at the same time as her. She made me and my brother only some pasta(while it's great that she cooks us breakfast once in a blue moon, it's still not enough and I want to get fit; which is not happening with only pasta as food). I ate, had my morning coffee, and went out for the gym; only to realize I forgot my charger. I went back to get it(it's sunny as hell and our house is uphill). Turns out, I forgot my towel and slippers for the shower. I went back up again crying. My mom yelled at me for coming back again. Then I went back out.

I went to the other gym which is in maintenance(my dad is in the military so I have access to all military gyms) to ask if the maintenance was still ongoing. 10 minutes or so of walking under the sun. It was under construction so I had to walk back, only to realize I had no time left to both work out and to work as a street vendor(context : my parents make me sell shitty accessories under a bridge and they take half the money to ""buy gold for saving up"" which I hate even if it's true). 

I just went to the post office to ask if I could have the swiss army knife I ordered covertly(because my parents don't want me to be happy and just get something i like)delivered there. They said no. Now I have to change the address but the app gives me an error.

Now I got drunk at home because I don't want to feel responsible for the stuff I have to do(I need to study but I genuinely don't want to). I fucking hate my life and everything in it. I live only because my girlfriend wants me to. Everything about my life is hopeless, depressing and disgusting. I'm never going to be happy.

1m6c18x,http://positvelypets.com,🐇 Why Rabbits Make Great Companions For Seniors,"*A Heartwarming Look at the Quiet Joys of Bunny Companionship in Later Life*

# 🐰 Why Rabbits Make Great Companions for Seniors

When you think of pets for older adults, cats and dogs often come to mind. But what about rabbits? These **quiet, gentle animals** can be **deeply affectionate** and make **excellent companions** for seniors seeking calm, low-maintenance pets.

Rabbits offer:

* Peaceful companionship 
* Minimal noise 
* Easy grooming needs 
* Therapeutic emotional benefits 

🧡 *For many seniors, rabbits are the perfect in-between of independence and companionship.*

# 💞 Emotional Benefits of Rabbits for Seniors

Rabbits are emotionally intuitive and thrive on routine, two qualities that align well with the daily lives of many senior citizens. Their presence can bring comfort, exercise, and affection without overwhelming responsibility.

**Key emotional benefits include:**

* **Reducing loneliness** and isolation 
* Providing **a sense of purpose**
* Encouraging **gentle touch and affection**
* Offering **comfort through routine**
* Promoting **mindfulness and calm**

📘 *Many seniors find that stroking a rabbit’s soft fur reduces anxiety and improves mood.*

# 🛋️ Physical & Lifestyle Compatibility

Rabbits are **indoor-friendly**, which means seniors with limited mobility or those living in smaller spaces, such as apartments or assisted living facilities, can still enjoy the benefits of pet ownership.

**What makes rabbits ideal for senior lifestyles?**

* Don’t require walks 
* Litter-trainable 
* Quiet and non-disruptive 
* Adapt well to a slower pace. 
* You should only require moderate daily care. 

🚪 *Rabbits thrive in calm, controlled environments like many seniors do.*

# 🧠 Health Benefits of Rabbit Companionship

Numerous studies have shown the **therapeutic effects of pet companionship**. Rabbits may not bark or purr, but they offer subtle emotional support and routine that benefits senior health.

**Notable health impacts:**

* Lowers **blood pressure and stress levels**
* Helps regulate **daily structure**
* Encourages **gentle movement** through play or cleaning 
* Combats **depression and cognitive decline** through interaction 

🧓🏻 *Caring for a bunny gives seniors a daily task that’s manageable and meaningful.*

# 🐇 What to Know Before Bringing a Rabbit Home

While rabbits are relatively low-maintenance, they do have specific care needs that seniors (or caregivers) should be aware of:

* **Diet:** Hay, fresh greens, and pellets 
* **Housing:** Spacious indoor cage or x-pen, cleaned regularly 
* **Exercise:** Daily supervised free-roam time in a safe area 
* **Grooming:** Regular brushing (especially for long-haired breeds) 
* **Health:** Routine vet care and checkups 

💡 *Tip: Consider adopting an older rabbit—they are calmer, already trained, and often overlooked.*

# 🐾 Best Rabbit Breeds for Senior Companionship

Not all rabbits have the same personality. Some are more active or skittish, while others are naturally calm and cuddly.

**Top rabbit breeds for seniors:**

* **Mini Lop** – Friendly and cuddly 
* **Holland Lop** – Gentle and low-key 
* **English Angora** – Soft and snuggly (needs grooming help) 
* **Rex** – Known for their plush velvet fur and laid-back attitude 
* **Mini Rex** – Smaller version, perfect for indoor settings 

🏡 *Adopt from a shelter or rescue that can match a rabbit’s temperament to your needs.*

# 🐰 A Pet That Fits the Heart—and the Home

Rabbits are a **gentle, loving choice** for senior citizens who want a **soothing and interactive companion** without the higher demands of more traditional pets. Whether enjoying a morning coffee with your bunny at your feet or simply having a quiet friend to share the day with, rabbits can bring joy, purpose, and comfort into a senior’s life.

At first, I thought his drinking was mainly because we were getting to know one another and having fun but I gradually started to feel uneasy about how much he drank. I really began to notice that it was an issue when we went away for a family holiday (me and my then 12 yr old and my partner). We went to a pub for lunch and he spent more time at the bar back and forth to the table than he did with us. I drove us back to the holiday home and he kept on drinking all afternoon (and drank the owners booze too). He absolutely stank of alcohol the next day and I had to drive us home because he was most definitely over the limit. There was no apology or acknowledgement that he had overdone it. I told him when we got home that I was concerned by how much he was drinking and that I thought he needed to rein it in. I suggested we do dry Jan which he agreed to.

Fast forward to mid Jan and i noticed that the whiskey bottle in the cabinet was a very strange light yellow colour. Turns out it was mostly water and after confronting him about this he came clean and told me he had been drinking it and watering it down. After this, I have periodically smelt alcohol on his breath during the middle of the day, but he has denied drinking. I have found more bottles of whiskey or other booze in the cabinet or in his car. When I confront him he says he hides it to avoid conflict with me (even though he drinks in front of me, and we will have a glass of wine together over dinner). Every holiday we have been on involves him binge drinking every day. And sometimes when we've been away he will have whiskey in his coffee in the morning or a glass of wine.

He denies he has a drinking problem (although I have threatened to leave him if there is any more dishonesty and he now admits that maybe there is a problem and has promised that he will quit drinking). But I grew up in a house where alcohol was normalised so I am having a hard time trusting my gut and doubting myself. He is also kind and patient and doesn't get angry so I know it could be worse. But I feel like he has created an environment that has normalised dishonesty and deception and I have lost my trust in him and in our relationship. I guess i am just seeking advice as to whether you think there is a serious problem here. I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a hyper vigilant state and I feel like that is where I am at right now. I'm also spending way too much time thinking about what to do. 

TL;DR my partner has a problematic relationship with alcohol; but I worry I am overreacting because alcohol is prevalent and has been normalised in my life. ",3,1753185048.0,relationships,6,1.0,False

I’d always dreamed of creating a shooter that I’d actually want to play on my phone. Not some pay-to-win nonsense. Something chaotic, fast, a little rough around the edges—but fun.

So I spent months learning, building, tweaking, rage-quitting, and restarting. And finally, after many late nights and lots of coffee, I released it:

* I learned more in a year than in 5 years of my old job

What went wrong:

* Marketing is *brutal*
* Getting visibility on the App Store as an indie = almost impossible
* I'm now best friends with anxiety 🫠

I'm starting to wonder if I should just move to a different city entirely to escape all these memories, but that feels like running away. At the same time, I can't keep living like a prisoner in my own hometown.

We built a life together, and now I don't know how to live in the spaces we once shared. I'm trying to be strong and focus on self-improvement, but some days I feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water.

**Questions for you:**

* For those who've been through something similar, how did you reclaim your city and your life after a major breakup?
* How long did it take before you could go to your old spots without feeling gutted?

I'm genuinely lost here and could use some perspective from people who've walked this path before me.

**TL;DR:** My ex-girlfriend and I built our life around our city. Now that she's gone, I can't go anywhere without being flooded with memories of us together. The mornings are the worst, and I'm considering either moving cities or dedicating my life to something bigger.

One morning, I read something online that said, *“Talk to yourself like you’re someone you care about.”* I thought it was BS.

But I tried it.

I stood in front of my mirror, holding a spoon (don’t ask why - it was just there), and said out loud:

“You’re not a piece of trash. You just need coffee, a win, and less screen time.”

Then I smacked the spoon on the counter like I was sealing a deal.

Weirdest part? It made me laugh. And that tiny laugh carried me through the rest of the day. I started doing it every morning. Spoon. Mirror. Pep talk.

3 weeks later, I wasn’t fixed, but I was lighter. Less self-hating.

So yeah… self-help is weird. But sometimes, a dumb ritual is better than doomscrolling.

# Best Stainless Steel Grinder 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

Teh stainless steel grinder has become an indispensable tool for anyone serious about culinary pursuits, from professional chefs to home cooking enthusiasts. Offering durability, hygiene, and precision, these grinders are a significant upgrade from plastic or less robust alternatives. They’re not just for grinding spices; they can also handle coffee beans, nuts, herbs, and more, ensuring fresh and consistent results every time.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key features to look for in a stainless steel grinder, review some of the top models expected to dominate the market in 2025, and provide valuable insights to help you make the best purchasing decision for your needs.## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness and longevity of a stainless steel grinder depend heavily on its key features. Let's examine the essential components that differentiate a high-quality grinder from a mediocre one.**Material Quality:** The grade of stainless steel used is paramount. Look for grinders made from food-grade stainless steel,specifically 304 or 316.These grades are resistant to corrosion, rust, and staining, ensuring durability and preventing unwanted flavors from leaching into your ingredients.

The higher the quality of the stainless steel, the longer the grinder will last and the safer it will be for food preparation. Lower grades of stainless steel may contain harmful substances that can contaminate your ingredients.The choice of stainless steel should be a key deciding factor.

**Grinding Mechanism:** The core of any grinder is its grinding mechanism. Ceramic or stainless steel burrs are preferable to blades, especially for coffee grinding. Burrs produce a consistent particle size, leading to better flavor extraction. Blade grinders chop the ingredients unevenly,resulting in inconsistent results.

Burr grinders come in two main types: conical and flat. Conical burrs are generally quieter and generate less heat, while flat burrs grind faster and produce a more uniform particle size. Consider the type of ingredients you'll be grinding most often when deciding between conical and flat burrs.

**Adjustability:** The ability to adjust the grind size is crucial for versatility. Look for grinders with multiple grind settings, allowing you to tailor the coarseness for different applications.A fine grind is ideal for espresso,while a coarser grind is better for French press coffee or certain spices.

A wide range of grind settings ensures that you can achieve the perfect consistency for any ingredient.The adjustment mechanism should be easy to use and provide precise control over the grind size. Avoid grinders with vague or imprecise grind settings.

**Capacity and Size:** The capacity of the grinder should match your typical usage. If you frequently grind large batches, opt for a model with a larger hopper. Conversely, if you only grind small amounts at a time, a smaller, more compact grinder might potentially be more convenient.

Consider the dimensions of the grinder and whether it will fit comfortably on your countertop or in your storage space. Too large of a grinder might become cumbersome, while too small of a grinder can limit your ability to grind large batches efficiently.

**Ease of Cleaning:** A grinder that is easy to disassemble and clean is essential for maintaining hygiene and preventing flavor contamination. Look for models with removable parts that are dishwasher-safe or easy to wipe down.

Regular cleaning is crucial for preventing the buildup of oils and residue that can affect the flavor of your ingredients. A grinder with intricate or non-removable parts can be difficult to clean thoroughly, leading to potential hygiene issues and flavor transfer.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality stainless steel grinder offers several compelling benefits that enhance your culinary experiance.

**Improved Flavor and Aroma:** Grinding ingredients fresh releases their full flavor and aroma potential. Pre-ground spices and coffee lose their potency over time, while freshly ground ingredients deliver a vibrant and intense flavor profile.

Freshly ground coffee, for example, contains volatile compounds that are responsible for its distinctive aroma and taste. These compounds dissipate quickly after grinding, so grinding right before brewing is essential for maximizing flavor. Similarly, freshly ground spices offer a more intense and complex flavor than pre-ground alternatives.

**Enhanced Control and precision:** A stainless steel grinder allows you to control the grind size, ensuring optimal results for different applications.This is particularly important for coffee brewing, where the grind size directly affects the extraction rate and the overall flavor of the coffee.

For example, a coarser grind is needed for French press coffee to prevent over-extraction, while a finer grind is required for espresso to achieve the desired crema and flavor.With a high-quality grinder, you can easily adjust the grind size to match your brewing method and achieve consistently perfect results.**Durability and Longevity:** Stainless steel grinders are built to last. The robust construction and corrosion-resistant material ensure that the grinder can withstand years ofuse without deteriorating. This makes them a worthwhile investment compared to less durable alternatives.

Unlike plastic grinders, which can crack or break easily, a stainless steel grinder is designed to withstand the rigors of daily use. The stainless steel construction also prevents rusting and staining, ensuring that the grinder remains in excellent condition for many years.

**Hygiene and Food Safety:** Stainless steel is a hygienic and food-safe material that is easy to clean and sanitize. This is crucial for preventing the buildup of bacteria and other contaminants that can affect the flavor and safety of your ingredients.

Stainless steel is non-porous, meaning that it doesn't absorb flavors or odors from the ingredients being ground. this prevents cross-contamination and ensures that each batch of ingredients is ground fresh and pure. Regular cleaning with soap and water is all that is needed to maintain the hygiene of a stainless steel grinder.

## FAQs Section

Here are some common questions consumers ask about stainless steel grinders:

**What are the different types of stainless steel grinders available?**

There are manual and electric stainless steel grinders. Manual grinders require physical effort to operate, while electric grinders are powered by electricity. Burr grinders, which use two revolving abrasive surfaces to grind, produce more consistent results than blade grinders.

Electric grinders are generally more convenient for grinding large quantities of ingredients, while manual grinders offer more control over the grinding process and are a good option for those who prefer a more hands-on approach. Burr grinders are superior to blade grinders for coffee grinding as they produce a more uniform particle size, resulting in better flavor extraction.

**How do I clean and maintain a stainless steel grinder?**

Most stainless steel grinders can be disassembled for cleaning. Wash the removable parts with warm, soapy water and dry them thoroughly before reassembling. For electric grinders, avoid immersing the motor housing in water. Wipe it down with a damp cloth instead.

Regular cleaning is essential for preventing the buildup of oils and residue that can affect the flavor of your ingredients. It's also important to avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch the stainless steel surface.

**Are stainless steel grinders suitable for grinding coffee beans?**

Yes, stainless steel grinders are excellent for grinding coffee beans. Actually, many coffee enthusiasts prefer stainless steel burr grinders for their ability to produce a consistent grind size, which is crucial for achieving optimal flavor extraction.

When choosing a stainless steel grinder for coffee beans, look for a model with adjustable grind settings and burrs made from either stainless steel or ceramic. Avoid blade grinders,as they tend to chop the beans unevenly,resulting in inconsistent flavor.

## Competitor comparison

Let's compare our featured stainless steel grinder against two competitors in the market, focusing on key features and performance.

* **grinding Mechanism:** Conical stainless steel burrs for consistent particle size.

* **Adjustability:** 15 grind settings for various brewing methods (espresso to French press).

* **Capacity:** 8 oz bean hopper, suitable for both home and light commercial use.

#### [Competitor 1 Name: CoffeTech Elite Grinder]

* **Grinding Mechanism:** Flat ceramic burrs, known for low heat generation.

* **Adjustability:** Stepless grind adjustment, offering finer control.

For users prioritizing coffee and diverse brewing options, the GrindMaster Pro offers the best balance.

## Ideal User profile

Stainless steel grinders cater to a specific segment of users who value quality, consistency, and durability in their kitchen tools.**Coffee Enthusiasts:** Individuals who take their coffee seriously and appreciate the nuances of different brewing methods will find a stainless steel grinder indispensable. Grinding fresh beans right before brewing is crucial for maximizing flavor and aroma, and a high-quality grinder ensures a consistent grind size, which is essential for proper extraction.**Professional Chefs and Cooks:** In professional kitchens, consistency and efficiency are paramount. Stainless steel grinders provide a reliable and durable solution for grinding spices, herbs, and other ingredients, ensuring uniform results and minimizing downtime. The hygienic properties of stainless steel are also important in a commercial setting, where food safety is a top priority.

## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

After replacing three tables due to various accidents and spills, I finally figured out what makes a coffee table truly family-friendly.

First, material choice is crucial. Glass tables might look elegant, but they're a fingerprint magnet and potentially dangerous with small children. I've found that solid wood or high-quality engineered wood tables work best. They're durable, easy to clean, and can handle the occasional toy car crash or juice spill.

Round or oval tables are generally safer than rectangular ones. Those sharp corners are practically magnets for toddler foreheads - trust me on this one. If you're set on a rectangular design, look for tables with rounded edges. I recently found some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Storage is another game-changer. Coffee tables with built-in drawers or lift-top designs have saved my sanity. They're perfect for quick cleanup when unexpected guests arrive, and they provide extra space for storing toys, books, or gaming controllers.

Height matters too. A table that's too tall becomes a climbing challenge for toddlers, while one that's too short might encourage roughhousing. I've found that tables between 16-18 inches high work best for most families.

Surface texture is something many people overlook. Smooth surfaces show scratches more easily, while slightly textured ones hide minor wear and tear better. Whatever you choose, make sure it's easy to wipe clean.

Consider your lifestyle needs. If your family enjoys board games or puzzles, a larger surface area might be important. For movie nights with snacks, look for tables with spill-resistant finishes.

Budget-wise, it's worth investing in quality. I made the mistake of buying cheap tables initially, but they didn't last. You can find plenty of durable, family-friendly options at different price points here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Remember to check reviews from other parents. They often mention important details about durability and maintenance that you won't find in product descriptions.

Finally, involve your kids in the decision if they're old enough. When children feel included in furniture choices, they're often more careful with them. Plus, it's a great opportunity to teach them about making practical decisions.

The right coffee table can be both functional and stylish while standing up to the chaos of family life. It's all about finding that sweet spot between durability, safety, and design.",1,1753184366.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Not because I wanted to sound smart at parties. My college roommate (philosophy major) told me that's what the ancient Stoics did they read every morning to train their minds. Idk if that was even true.

**How to Start (If You Haven't Read a Book Since High School):**

* Pick something you're genuinely curious about. Not what you think you ""should"" read. Curious about money? Read ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" Into psychology? Try ""Thinking, Fast and Slow."" Love stories? Pick up fiction that actually makes you think.
* Start with 10 pages. Not 50. Not ""I'll read for an hour."" Just 10 pages. Every morning. Before you touch your phone just read.
* Physical books only (at least at first). Your phone has trained you to skim and jump around. Books train you to go deep.
* Keep it visible. Put the book next to your bed. On your coffee table. Make it easier to grab than your phone.

Your attention span gets longer. Your thoughts get clearer. You start seeing patterns everywhere because you're feeding your brain actual substance instead of digital candy.

**But here's where people screw it up:**

1. They try it once, get bored, and quit. Yeah no shit it feels slow at first. Your brain is used to getting dopamine hits every 3 seconds. It's supposed to feel weird. Give it two weeks. Minimum.
2. They ease into it. Start with audiobooks or short articles. Nope. Pick up a real book. Physical pages. Make your brain do the work. Get the real effect of focused, sustained attention.
3. They treat it like homework. It's not a chore. It's mental strength training. Don't just ""get through pages"" lean into the ideas. Make it a daily win.

After 4 years:

* My attention span went from goldfish to laser-focused
* I stopped falling for clickbait and surface-level thinking
* Conversations got deeper because I had actual thoughts, not just reactions
* Problems started looking like puzzles instead of disasters
* I became the guy people come to for advice

Still reading. Still sometimes feels like work. Still doing it. I think it's flipped my relationship with discipline, because in the end, not being disciplined means you stop once it requires effort.

Try it tomorrow. No thinking. Just grab a book and read 10 pages. Let me know how it hits your brain differently than scrolling. And start with something you're actually interested in curiosity beats discipline.

“Hey Lynne.” Martin appeared out of nowhere and leaned into the driver’s window. He was “the new guy” having only moved here to Foxhead, best city in the world, a month ago specifically for this job. He was really good at handling people with serious injuries at the scene of vehicle accidents. I was happy he was my partner tonight. “Heard we got a call for a possible head injury on Tarkan Road.”

Nothing had come in on the radio or by phone. “First I heard of it.” I radio’d in and asked for our assignment. Jenny on dispatch asked me to hang on. Martin got into the passenger seat and readied for official confirmation.

Jenny confirmed possible head injury, Tarkan Road by the cemetery. I put the van into drive and got into traffic heading to our destination. Jenny provided an update: Cause of injury unknown; it was not a vehicle accident. 

That was odd. Martin and I exchanged a quick glance. We aren’t ambulance attendants and we aren’t police. We’re the city’s version of fill-ins, called to handle urgent issues when EMTs aren’t readily available. It isn’t a bad job and, while stressful, it’s very rewarding, but it was weird to be sent to a location that didn’t sound like immediate attention was required.

“Not a vehicle accident,” Martin repeated. He tilted his head slightly and frowned like he was weighing our options out. “Head injury though. Never been to Tarkan Road Cemetery. I hear people are dying to get into it.”

I groaned. Dad jokes were Martin’s specialty, if Dad jokes can be considered a specialty. He rewarded himself with a chocolate bar, his usual pre-call routine. As I changed lanes to turn left at the lights, I wondered how he knew about the call before me. Then again, he probably never heard of Tarkan Road or, as we locals called it, Tarkan. By the time we’d completed the turn, I decided Tarkan took priority.

I cleared my throat and raised my voice slightly to make sure he could hear me. “No bullshit, this is serious. You know the legend of Tarkan?”

“There’s a legend?” He crumpled the chocolate bar wrapper and stuck it in the small trash bag we keep up front. “Fill me in.” 

We were at least ten minutes from our destination so I had plenty of time to explain. “I wouldn’t even mention it but I saw it. I felt it. Shit, lemme explain then I’ll take questions.

“I grew up hearing about The Headless Guy on Tarkan. Late 1800s, Augie was a quiet guy who owned the land that’s now the cemetery. His parents were wealthy. They owned the general store and the bakery which meant Augie was set for life. He wanted to marry Hetty but his parents arranged for him to marry his second cousin Connie. Augie married Connie and continued getting busy with Hetty three times a week, in the shed on his property. Everyone knew about Augie’s affair and one day Hetty and Connie got into a physical fight at the general store. Following me so far?”

“Yeah, go on boomer, you and your ‘getting busy’” he chuckled while using finger quotes, “I hope this gets interesting.”

I continued because yes, it does get interesting fast. “That night, Augie went to meet Hetty at the shed. He opened the door. Hetty’s head rolled out. Connie was inside holding an ax. She kicked Hetty’s body out of the way and ran after Augie. When she caught him, she cut off his head and threw it into the street that became Tarkan Road.”

During my pause, Martin whispered, “That escalated quickly.”

“That isn’t the worst part. Connie laid down, grabbed Augie’s head, gave him one last kiss and cut off her own head.”

“Holy shit.”

“April of 95, our art class went on a field trip to the cemetery. I had my camera. Lots of great photo and sketching spots. I was crouched down about 10 feet from the ironwork fence, and it was unbelievable how perfect this shot was. A second before I took the shot, something cold ran through me like a ghost on a mission. I dropped my camera and landed face-first but lucky I wasn’t close enough to the fence to hit it. 

“Something was burning my left arm though, it was painful. The teacher ran over to help me up. She screamed when she saw my arm and wouldn’t let me look. She had it wrapped in her waterproof jacket by the time the ambulance arrived. Doctor declared it was an ax cut and I was lucky it wasn’t deeper or it would have hit the bone. That’s the day I changed my career choice from photography to medical. The end.”

“Woah. Woah.” Martin lifted his hand like he was trying to stop traffic. “You’re saying Augie’s ghost ran through you, and Connie tried to chop your arm off?”

“That’s what it seemed like.” I checked the time again. Six minutes to destination. We would be right on time.

“Did you go back?”

I thought about how to word my answer. “Never wanted to.”

“You could have turned down this call.” He was correct. If there was a pressing issue for one of us to turn down a call we could. Generally that meant a family member or close friend was involved. 

”It’s our job,” I said, moving into the right lane to make the last turn before the left onto Tarkan. Could have been my imagination but the change in atmosphere put a chill down my spine. Happened every time I got close to that damned road. I rolled up my window.

“Is the cemetery usually lit up at night?” 

There was, no word of a lie, a warm yellow light enveloping the cemetery, something I’d not seen in all the years of living and working in Foxhead. I tapped on the brakes and exhaled softly. “Uh, no.”

Right turn, travel a few yards, left turn and we were on Tarkan, heading towards the cemetery on the right. The light helped us to see the road as well as the cemetery. There were no people or vehicles on the road or the shoulders. Not that anything should have been there. It’s a cemetery. At night. Close to Foxhead city limits. The place where I got attacked by two ghosts *during the day.*

Martin left the van, frowning. He shone his flashlight around us and looked, for lack of a better word, jumpy. He didn’t stop until he was standing behind my door.


My left arm ached. I jumped out of the van, went to the front by the passenger side and rubbed the old wound a couple of times. Martin followed me and leaned on the driver’s side of the hood, facing the cemetery. Better him than me.

He cleared his throat. “Aliens use green lights, right?” 

“Do I look like an alien expert?”

He cleared his throat again and grinned. “Dude. I hear things at work. Yes, you are.”

Oh shit. Oh well. “Feel that in the air? Would you call it electricity or static?”

“They’re the same thing.”

“Listen for a minute. You’re feeling static. It makes you nauseous, dizzy and messes up your senses. It’s the power of an angry ghost except, um.”

My attention was pulled to a single spot on my right, coming out of the cemetery about 100 feet from the van. I was closer to it than Martin was and probably blocked him from seeing the static coalescing into a humanoid shape about five feet tall. The person, probably a man, would have been taller had his head been on his neck and not hanging by the hair from his left hand. 

When the static formed into the traditional all-white that lots of people picture when thinking of ghosts, I knew we were in trouble. The body made sure the face turned to me and it began walking at me. I’d like to say it was walking to me but this ghost meant business.

Martin didn’t know that yet. He sniffed and asked, “Why does it smell like bread?”

“Get in the van,” I said without turning to look at him. “Before it smells like burnt matches.”

He couldn’t see my face so he might have thought I was joking. “How do I know when it will smell like &mdash; “

“Now, Martin. That time is now.”

From the corner of my eye I saw him turn his head to look in my direction. A vehicle door slammed. I hoped Martin had listened to me. I was fully focused on Ghostly Augie who, it seemed, was focused on me. 

“Come on now,” I said as I raised my hands and walked backwards beside the van. “You know this doesn’t end well.”

“Chuckleheaded coffee boiler,” Augie’s head yelled. 

I stopped backing up and stared at the neck where the head wasn’t. Yeah I know, big mistake. Augie threw the head at me. It collided with my forehead and knocked my head back into the passenger’s window. 

I saw stars. My knees buckled. 

Someone screamed in the distance. My upper left arm hurt. The person screaming spoke English: “Get up, get in.”

I blinked a couple of times. Martin was leaning out the window, pulling me up by my left arm. My head hurt something fierce. Ghostly Connie used her bloody ax to push Ghostly Augie out of her way. Every cell in my body said she was coming for me.

Before I could say “Open the door,” Martin opened the passenger door I was leaning against. He took hold of my right arm and pulled me backwards into the van as far as he could.

He started the van and rolled up the window. “Feet in, close the door,” he ordered. I flopped around trying to do exactly that and hit my forehead against the window while closing the door. Martin locked the doors and slammed on the gas, going in reverse. I would have been more interested in where he was going but the blood on the inside of the window distracted me. I put my hand up to confirm what I already knew, the blood was mine.

“Belt,” Martin ordered. He spun the van around to aim the right way before we got to the intersection.

When we were a couple of streets away from the cemetery, he continued. “You’re going home. I know about Tiburon. Not a lot but enough. I know we can’t let anyone else know about this. Can I tell Jenny there was no head injury but someone pelted us with rocks and we need the rest of the night off?”

I nodded which made me wince. He laughed. He got us the rest of the night off. 

“Thing is,” he said when he pulled into my driveway, “the head injury call? That was a prediction, not a nuisance call. I’ll try to get the caller info from dispatch tomorrow.”

Institutions are moving to Ethereum itself, the Layer 1 chain. They trust it for its security and reliability, this is because Ethereum is the foundation that has held up for years without a single crash. Studies back this up, showing zero successful attacks since 2015. Big entities like banks and investment firms see it as a safe bet for their money and tech.

On the other side we have people like you and me, the retail users who are heading to L2s, like Arbitrum and Base for example. They are faster and more importantly they are cheaper, cutting transaction costs by more than half. L2s are built for everyday use, things like buying groceries, your favorite coffee, gaming, whatever you want to do with crypto. Merchants are using L2s, making it easy with familiar setups. Adriano Feria, an influential Ethereum community member, posted a tweet on this very topic. Adriano said Ethereum locks in the big players while L2s handle the rest of us.

Some people hype other blockchains (we know who they are) but that is just noise. Ethereum's stability and L2 scalability show where the real growth is. And know this: Ethereum will reach 100k transactions per second by next year. Everything is falling into place for mass adoption and that is the only thing that matters.

and let me tell you, she had work done!
the dinosaurs are dead. gone. extinct again. someone in city planning finally said, “what if, instead of emotionally scarring the next generation with haunted reptiles and municipal decay, we give them… a fountain?” and they did. and now here we are. no more cracked brontosaurus with half its jaw missing. just water. flowing. like my unresolved issues. 

because once upon a time, this plaza wasn’t a soft-lit, pigeons-are-chill, lovers-are-giggling type of place. no. it was the wild west, with less law and more solvent. rugby boys were camped out behind the swing set, chasing enlightenment via plastic bag. robbers lingered in the shadows, eyeing passersby like walking atm machines with poor judgment. and somewhere off to the side, the local sex work economy tried to keep things lowkey, emphasis on tried.

i was eight, walking past the gates like i was entering a boss fight. 
don’t look up. don’t make eye contact. if you hear your name whispered, no you didn’t. keep walking.

so now? seeing it all paved and peaceful and welcoming? honestly, i’m suspicious.
who gave jaro plaza a redemption arc? who let it find inner peace before i did?

but hey, credit where it’s due. the dinosaurs are dead. the trauma fog has lifted.

and here's the truth: public spaces matter. they’re the only places where you can spiral in peace without paying for coffee or emotional labor. they’re where the soul briefly forgets inflation. where you can romanticize your life, cry discreetly, and be perceived just enough.

so go. bring a book you won’t read. dramatically stare at the fountain like you’re in the third act of a film no one’s funding. text your ex then unsend it. watch life happen and pretend you’re above it.

jaro plaza has been revived. the dinosaurs are gone. but your inner drama queen? very much alive.

# Monday, July 21st (Two New Ideas to Introduce!)

# Weather & Monday Rundown:
Note: latest edition released yesterday (Monday) 
Monday's bringing us that sweet spot of Vermont summer weather: sunny skies with temperatures hovering in the comfortable upper 60s to low 70s range. Tuesday morning will have us reaching for light jackets as temps dip into the 40s and 50s, but afternoon sunshine will warm things back to the 70s. The real heat arrives midweek: Wednesday bumps us into the 80s, and Thursday? We're talking upper 80s to low 90s with humidity making its unwelcome return. Those planning outdoor activities should note that Thursday night into Friday brings our next shot at thunderstorms, though the weekend's looking solid with partly sunny skies and mid-80s temps both days.

Tonight's absolutely perfect for those Monday evening runs happening around town. The OGE Fun Run kicks off at 6 PM at Outdoor Gear Exchange, where Kae Ravichandran leads trail enthusiasts on lakeside routes that promise sunset views without the intensity, just pure running joy for all levels. Meanwhile, Skirack has their Monday Group Runs, also at 6 PM, aiming for 3-5 miles with pace groups to match everyone's comfort zone. The ONE Farmers Market runs until 6:30 PM today, transforming the Old North End into a celebration of local flavors with Ghanaian, Laotian, and Korean prepared foods alongside the usual farm-fresh suspects. Cap off your Monday at 6:30 PM with the Odd Fellows' summer BBQ potluck on North Ave. Bring something to grill or share, expect lawn games and good vibes, no entry fee required.

Tuesday's cool morning will warm beautifully for afternoon events, starting with UVM Dining's Job Fair from 1-5 PM at Harris-Millis Complex. They're offering $18.50-$25 hourly plus an extra $3 for evening and weekend shifts, which honestly isn't terrible for Burlington. The real Tuesday action comes at 4 PM when Cars and Foam takes over Foam Brewers' waterfront, launching WOLFSGART's weeklong automotive celebration with DJs, food trucks, and what promises to be an Instagram-worthy collection of cars against our lake backdrop. Wednesday brings major community engagement opportunities: the planBTV New North End Design Workshop runs 5:30-8 PM at Hunt Middle School, where residents can shape the neighborhood's future vision and weigh in on the VT-127 path connection. Same evening, car culture continues with Sunset on Pine at The Pinery starting at 5 PM, bringing food truck mania to the Arts District. Those seeking something more refined can catch the Craftsbury Chamber Players at 7:30 PM in Colchester performing Mozart, Boccherini, and Beethoven.

Thursday's heat wave timing couldn't be better for our evening festivities. Party on the Bricks returns at 5:30 PM featuring The Blue Dahlia's multicultural sounds and Church Street Tavern's pub fare. Expect dancing in the streets and that special Burlington summer energy. South Burlington's final Nite Out of the season starts at 5:30 PM on Dorset Street, complete with fireworks and a food vendor lineup that reads like a Burlington restaurant week roster. If you haven’t been, I hope you’ll check out the season’s last one! Car enthusiasts get their third event of the week with the Brew Hop at Switchback and Burlington Beer Company starting at 5 PM, because apparently we can't get enough beautiful vehicles paired with local brews. Round out your week with Paint & Sip at Venetian Soda Lounge at 7 PM, where Jesse Snyder teaches the art of #foodp\*rn painting while DJ Grant Burton sets the mood. And for those planning their weekend: Friday brings Recharge Friday at Savu Sauna Lakeside (7:30-9:30 PM): sauna, cold plunge, N/A cocktails and DJ beats for a different kind of Friday night party that gets you home by 10 ([$35 person](https://partiful.com/e/akAZBKE7Xy4oOMCetRua?fbclid=PAQ0xDSwLriolleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABpxg_JbbNieCac3-XovbnkcZErjXtpuKVHP2e4acwrQHB8a5A9xB-Pwn-ukKX_aem_AWEdITsMFXvc4O-LS2lemQ&utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)).

Weekly Wednesday Passeggiata Deals: [https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/wednesday-passeggiata](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/wednesday-passeggiata)

Burlington's historical July averages are around 81.8 °F for highs and 61.3 °F for lows. Currently, the weather is running cooler (highs in the mid‑70s and lows in the low‑50s) though it will trend back toward the typical warm summer feel by mid‑week

# Burlington Table: Meet 5 Strangers at a Brewery (Monday, July 28th)

I’m excited to finally pass 1,000 subscribers for my Burlington newsletter! To celebrate I’m excited to launch a new idea I’ve been working on:

**Burlington Table is a new way to meet real people around a real table. Just good conversation with 5 strangers-turned-friends (6 total) over drinks at a local brewery next Monday, July 28th at 6pm. Drinking is optional, not a requirement!**

Each gathering is small, curated, and 21+ (bring ID). We'll likely be at Foam Brewers, but other breweries may be included if there's lots of interest. I'll send 10 fun icebreakers ahead of time, just in case you want help keeping the convo flowing. I do my best to balance each table by age, gender, and shared interests, so your answers help make the magic happen.

As the evening unfolds naturally, you're welcome to order food or share appetizers if the mood strikes. Whatever feels right for the group! The focus is simply on enjoying genuine connection without any agenda or timeline. Foam has great non-alcoholic beer, seltzer and soda if you're not drinking or just prefer a clear mind!

There's a suggested $5–$10 donation to cover organizing time, but it's totally free if that's not doable right now.

If you're looking for something real, this is your seat at the table. Click this link to fill out this form, and be sure its in by **Thursday night**: [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xc31WwIPUcND869_uuiOLhJ-B1Ub9OTPUrldhBnM6-I/edit?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

I hope you’ll check it out and tell your friends about! **The more people that sign up the better I can match the tables**! And if you want to read more about it check out this link:

""We keep doing it. When you've got that passion for the club, you can do anything,"" per WCAX.

The Green have mastered the art of the comeback, pulling off their third straight come-from-behind victory to advance to their first Eastern Conference Championship in program history. Down 2-0 to FC Motown in the second half, they responded with three unanswered goals, including a penalty kick winner from Julien Le Bourdoulous. Head coach Chris Taylor credits the team's culture and the passionate local community for giving them the energy to keep fighting when they're down. The momentum's real here, this team's creating something special at Virtue Field, and Friday's conference championship (opponent TBD) promises to be electric.

""We've built our store around community. We are community-oriented,"" per MYNBC5.

Mark your calendars for Saturday, July 26, when OGE throws what's essentially Burlington's biggest block party of the summer. Running from 11 AM to 10 PM, the celebration kicks off with a staff band at 12:30 PM followed by local musicians throughout the day. The real genius here is their raffle system: every $30 you spend leading up to the event earns you a ticket, so your gear addiction finally pays off. After three decades as a Church Street anchor, OGE has earned its place as more than just a store; it's where Burlington goes to fuel its outdoor obsession and bump into half the town doing the same.

""Playing a 'relocation game' is a failed strategy,"" per Reddit/Btown Brief.

Apologies for missing this in Thursday's edition. The four-hour marathon meeting from last Monday deserves your attention. The most heated exchange centered on Food Not Cops' relocation to City Hall Park, with councilors split between those citing negative impacts and others arguing the city's playing whack-a-mole instead of addressing root causes. The ""City Circle"" restorative justice program proposal aims to fix our broken ticketing system by actually compelling engagement rather than just issuing fines that go unpaid. Meanwhile, the REIB office took a unanimous first step toward charter status, and renters finally got included in water bill assistance.

[**Federal cuts result in layoffs at Vermont Foodbank**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/20/federal-cuts-result-layoffs-vermont-foodbank/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""These are people who are doing good work and helping people, and you know, we're an organization that cares about people,"" per WCAX.

The Vermont Foodbank has laid off seven employees, nearly 9% of staff, as federal COVID funding dries up and USDA food allocations drop by 20%. CEO John Sayles assures that food distribution won't be affected, but these cuts highlight how fragile our safety net remains. The silver lining: the state Legislature allocated $1.5 million this year, and last weekend's Do Good Fest raised $210,000. Still, losing dedicated staff who've been feeding vulnerable Vermonters feels like a step backward at a time when food insecurity hasn't magically disappeared with the pandemic emergency declarations.

[**Stowe teen preps for gubernatorial race**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/20/stowe-teen-preps-for-gubernatorial-race/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""When a kid in Vermont understands that there's a housing and affordability crisis, that's when you know it's bad,"" per VTDigger.

Dean Roy, a 14-year-old from Stowe running for governor on the Freedom and Unity Party ticket, might not unseat Phil Scott, but he's making points that resonate. The former legislative page who challenged Lt. Governor Rodgers on EVs is centering his campaign on property taxes and affordability; issues he admits seem ironic coming from someone who doesn't own property. His platform includes STR caps, a 5% tax on vacation rentals, and immigration reform. Whether you take a teenage gubernatorial candidate seriously or not, Roy's engaging his peers in politics and planning to stay on the ballot until he wins something, somewhere.

[**How the Lake Monsters kept swimming**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/20/how-the-lake-monsters-kept-swimming/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""The level of baseball is much better than when it was a single-A, short season,"" per VTDigger.

When MLB cut the Lake Monsters loose in 2020, it could've been game over for Burlington baseball. Instead, new ownership led by Chris English rebuilt the franchise as a summer collegiate league, won a championship their first season, and created something arguably better than what we had. GM C.J. Knudsen points to Vermont players like Wyatt Cameron and Colby Brouillette as proof that local kids can now dream of playing at Centennial Field (sorry, Delta Dental Park). With local partnerships from Arlington ice cream to Barre-bottled hot sauce, plus those genius 25-cent hot dog nights that pack the stands, the Lake Monsters have transformed from minor league afterthought to must-see summer entertainment.

[**South Burlington considers paying committee volunteers under new stipend proposal**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/south-burlington-considers-paying-committee-volunteers/65460024?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""$50 per meeting, based on attendance, and a $20 bonus for the chair of each committee,"" per MYNBC5.

South Burlington's considering joining Essex, Colchester, and Winooski in actually compensating the volunteers who keep municipal government running. At an estimated $60,000 annually, it's a recognition that asking people to donate hours of their time to review development proposals or plan city initiatives maybe deserves more than a pat on the back. The vote happens tonight at 6:30 PM, and honestly, if we want diverse voices in local government, removing financial barriers to participation seems like a no-brainer.

[**Kona Beachside brings island flavor to North Beach**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/kona-beachside-north-beach/65454948?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""I want people to walk away feeling relaxed,"" per MYNBC5.

Just when you thought North Beach couldn't get better, Kona Beachside Tiki Bar & Grill drops a slice of Polynesia on Lake Champlain. Owner Sandi Pasagic has created what sounds like the perfect Vermont summer spot: tropical drinks and island-inspired food with waterfront views, open daily from noon to 7 PM. After years of North Beach feeling like it was missing something beyond the snack bar, this addition gives us another reason to make the trek past the bike path. Pro tip: combine this with the Saturday beach scene for peak Burlington summer vibes.

[**Rash of Kia thefts continues to plague region**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/18/rash-kia-thefts-continues-plague-region/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""It's like a big joke. They pose it as like a trophy,"" per WCAX.

The TikTok-inspired Kia theft trend that started three years ago is somehow still happening, with about a dozen cars stolen in the past two weeks alone. The thieves are posting videos of their joyrides on social media before abandoning the destroyed vehicles. South Burlington Police are investigating, but no arrests yet. If you own a vulnerable Kia or Hyundai, contact your dealer about the fix; and maybe invest in a steering wheel lock while you're at it. The casual cruelty of destroying someone's transportation for social media clout is particularly galling when you consider how many people are already struggling with Burlington's cost of living.

[**Public media in our region braces for budget shortfalls**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/18/public-media-our-region-braces-budget-shortfalls/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""In order to maintain the services we provide, we're going to ask people to give more,"" per WCAX.

Federal cuts are hitting our regional public media hard: Vermont Public faces a $4 million shortfall (10% of budget), North Country Public Radio loses $650,000 over two years, and Mountain Lake PBS takes a devastating 35% cut. Vermont Public CEO Vijay Singh acknowledges they'll need to lean even harder on already-generous Vermonters. Rep. Elise Stefanik celebrated the cuts while calling NCPR's reporting ""false and defamatory,"" while Rep. Becca Balint called it a betrayal of rural communities. Whatever your politics, losing independent local journalism and emergency broadcasting capability seems shortsighted when we're increasingly dependent on reliable information.

# Volunteer Opportunity of the Week: Burlington Community Justice Center

There are so many volunteer opportunities in Burlington! This week I choose to highlight:

Help support neighbors who’ve experienced harm by volunteering with the *Parallel Justice* program at the Burlington Community Justice Center. This role involves checking in with victims after police reports, helping them navigate the legal system, and connecting them with local resources. Whether or not someone is held accountable, you’ll be part of a community response that prioritizes healing and support. Volunteers must be 18 or older and bring empathy, professionalism, and a respect for confidentiality. Training is provided—your presence can make a real difference.

Check out this page for links to four great sites with volunteer opportunities all around Burlington: [https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/volunteer-burlington](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/volunteer-burlington)

# 202+ Things to Do in Burlington (Summer Activities)

Today’s picks:

Five more to keep things feeling easy and open as the season winds down. Start your morning at the Burlington Farmers Market on Pine Street where you can pick up local produce, baked goods, and maybe catch some live music while you browse.

# This Week’s Restaurant Review: Pizzeria Verità

Pizzeria Verità has carved out a solid reputation since 2012 as Burlington's go-to spot for authentic Neapolitan pizza, complete with a wood-fired oven imported directly from Naples. The restaurant's commitment to traditional technique shows in every pie: hand-stretched dough with the signature puffy cornicione edge, quality San Marzano tomatoes, and fresh fior di latte mozzarella that's made in-house. Standout pizzas like the Mais, featuring fire-roasted Vermont corn with speck and crème fraîche, successfully bridge Italian tradition with local ingredients, while classics like the Margherita deliver the pure, simple flavors that define true Neapolitan style.

The lively, energetic atmosphere matches the open kitchen setup where diners can watch skilled pizzaioli at work, creating an engaging dining experience that feels both authentic and distinctly Burlington. Co-owners Leslie Wells and John Rao's dedication to the craft is evident: Wells trained in Italy and New York to master traditional techniques, and their emphasis on local Vermont ingredients through partnerships like the Vermont Fresh Network adds a meaningful community connection. The restaurant consistently ranks among Burlington's top dining spots, earning recognition in local ""Daysies"" awards and maintaining strong online reviews for both food quality and service.

However, Pizzeria Verità's popularity can work against it during peak times, when the bustling atmosphere tips into chaos and securing a table without reservations becomes tough. Prices run $15-20 per pizza, which can feel steep for some, but not bad compared to surrounding pizza places. The limited menu can leave some diners wanting more variety beyond the antipasti selection. The high-energy environment, while part of the appeal for many, can feel quite busy for those seeking a quieter meal, and service can become stretched thin when the restaurant hits capacity. Despite these drawbacks, Pizzeria Verità delivers on its promise of authentic Neapolitan pizza in a vibrant setting that captures Burlington's local dining scene.

[US moves decisively to avoid dependence on China’s rare earths | The Strategist](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/us-moves-decisively-to-avoid-dependence-on-chinas-rare-earths/)

*The Pentagon’s package of support for rare earths company MP Minerals, announced on 10 July, should free the US military and eventually much of US industry from dependence on Chinese supply chains for rare earth magnets.*

[Image: Chris Mok\/Unsplash.](https://preview.redd.it/xvdhi2d7feef1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cf4a3ff47da2a3c399f293f1bba44db966c06a9)

It resembles the decisive Japanese government support for Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths in 2010, which included a guaranteed offtake agreement and patient capital.

The Pentagon deal goes further, providing MP Minerals with a government-backed floor price for neodymium and dysprosium of US$110 a pound, double the prevailing price set by the Chinese market. It guarantees to deliver customers for the company’s entire output of rare earth magnets for 10 years, with the minimum price similarly underwritten for a decade. Completing the deal, Apple has provided a US$500 million offtake agreement.

While the share prices of Lynas and other local rare earths companies Iluka, Arafura and Northern Minerals jumped on news of the deal, in the hope that the United States would supplant China as the price-setting market for rare earths products, this is far from certain.

The MP Minerals floor price will need to be backed by tariffs if the US market is not to be flooded by offshore supplies. This could potentially threaten access to US markets for Australian rare earths producers.

Canadian critical minerals analysis company [Adamas Intelligence](https://www.adamasintel.com/did-the-us-just-nationalize-the-rare-earth-industry/) commented that the US subsidies to MP Minerals would need to be complemented by ‘robust trade policies to counter potential Chinese dumping and allied competition.’

Processing rare earths at scale has required government intervention to secure both offtake agreements and basic funding because of its technical complexity and lack of transparent pricing.

There are 17 rare earth elements, which combine in different ways in each deposit. Pilot plants to work out the chemical processes for separating them do not automatically translate to a full-scale operation. It took Lynas more than five years to get its Malaysian plant up to full-scale operation with product reaching the required standards of its Japanese customers.

Pricing is based on consultant surveys of Chinese rare earths sellers and buyers. There are no futures markets. Funders can have no assurance that a greenfield refinery, typically costing more than $1 billion, will either deliver product to customer requirements, let alone do so at a profit. Hence, the need for determined government support.

The Pentagon’s support for MP Minerals follows China’s imposition of export controls on rare earths and magnets in retaliation for US controls on chip exports and the Trump administration’s tariffs. It resulted in an effective embargo on sales to the US.

It mirrors the Japanese support for Lynas in the wake of China’s first use of rare earths as an economic weapon with a brief embargo on sales to Japan amid a dispute over the Senkaku Islands in 2010.

A week after the embargo was lifted, the Japanese and Australian governments signed an agreement on rare earths supply and the Japanese trading company Sojitz arranged US$325 million in finance for Lynas which would provide the Japanese market with rights to 9,000 tonnes of rare earth oxides a year for a decade. Finance for those sales would be provided by the state-owned Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation, JOGMEC.

The Trump administration has at times appeared to have a scatter-gun approach to rare earths, variously pitching to annex Canada and Greenland and appropriate Ukraine’s untapped reserves as payment for past military aid and extracting a promise of access to the rare earths reserves of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda in return for brokering a peace deal between the two.

Australia has been trying to elicit US government support for Australian rare earths projects ever since the period of the first Trump administration. One tangible outcome was a US Department of Defense agreement in 2020 to provide US$288 million to fund a joint venture between Lynas and US chemicals company Blue Line to build a separation plant in Texas for heavy rare earths. That was supposed to have been completed by 2025–2026, however site development has been frozen over an issue with wastewater permits.

As part of AUKUS’s enabling legislation, the US Congress agreed in late 2023 to make Australian and British companies eligible for Defense funding.

The Australian government had hoped that an offer to guarantee US access to Australian critical minerals would lead the US to drop its 10 percent tariff on imports from Australia and bring an influx of US investment. The offer was rejected.

**The US government’s preference, revealed in its deal with MP Materials, is to prioritize US interests. In July 2023,** ***The Strategist*** **published an** [**article**](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/an-american-view-on-us-investment-in-critical-mineral-mining-in-australia/) **by Georgetown University academic Shubham Dwivedi and US critical mineral analyst Greg Wischer arguing that US should be prepared to fund mines in Australia for minerals that were not readily available in the US or Canada but that any US investment in refining or further processing should be located in the US.**

# JULY 22nd, 2025~Breaking China’s Chokehold: Securing America’s Advanced Battery Supply Chains

**A livestream of the conversation will begin here at 1:30pm ET on Tuesday, July 22.**  
[Breaking China’s Chokehold: Securing America’s Advanced Battery Supply Chains](https://www.fdd.org/events/2025/07/22/breaking-chinas-chokehold-securing-americas-advanced-battery-supply-chains/)

# About

China has developed a state-led policy of weaponizing critical supply chains against rivals, raising serious economic security and national security concerns for the United States. Nowhere is this strategy more apparent than in advanced battery and critical mineral supply chains, where China controls upwards of 80% of the supply of graphite, cobalt, manganese, battery anodes, and the essential material for battery cathodes. China’s dominance of these supply chains represents a clear and present danger to the security of U.S. military supply chains and core industries, and the efficient functioning of market economies around the globe.

Both the Biden and Trump administrations have taken important steps to bolster domestic production of minerals, components, and batteries, but much more can and should be done to unlock private sector funding and innovation, support ally-shoring and allied capacity, stabilize pricing and streamline permitting. The U.S. must also develop strategies to push back against a wide range of Chinese non-market practices that it uses to establish supply chain dominance, create resource dependencies, undermine foreign rivals, concentrate economic power, and destabilize American and global economies.

There are strategies and solutions to break China’s battery chokehold that the U.S. should prioritize. In a new monograph, “[**Unplugging Beijing: A Playbook to Reclaim America’s Advanced Battery Supply Chain**](https://fdd-new.createsend1.com/t/r-i-tkllljjd-l-j/),” FDD’s Center on Economic and Financial Power (CEFP) examines the non-market practices driving China’s battery and critical mineral dominance, and explores policy responses that America and its allies can use to escape China’s economic gravity.

# July 22nd, 2025~Trump’s critical minerals obsession reignites deep-sea mining

[Trump’s critical minerals obsession reignites deep-sea mining - The Japan Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/07/22/world/politics/trump-minerals-deep-sea-mining/)

[Polymetallic nodules — bulbous lumps of rock that are rich in battery metals such as cobalt and nickel which carpet huge tracts of Pacific Ocean seabed — in Rarotonga in the Cook Islands on June 12. | AFP-JIJI](https://preview.redd.it/gar7ykn8ieef1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cd22a4208364e37a41c34d8fcf72435513131b7)

The leader of one of the most aggressive seabed mining startups spent years invoking global warming to spark interest in extracting avocado-sized rocks rich in electric-vehicle battery metals from the bottom of the ocean.

""We want to help the world transition away from fossil fuels with the smallest possible climate change and environmental impact,” Gerard Barron, the Australian chief executive officer of a company then known as DeepGreen, told a 2019 meeting of the United Nations-affiliated International Seabed Authority, which for a decade has been debating regulations to allow the mining of untouched, biodiverse deep-sea ecosystems in global waters.

That's not Barron’s pitch anymore. Climate was out and critical minerals were in during an appearance earlier this year before a congressional committee in Washington, DC. His firm, renamed as The Metals Company (TMC), would help ""ensure the nation's energy security and industrial competitiveness for generations,” Barron said. ""China is close behind.”

Barron’s new tack is working. In April, President Donald Trump issued an executive order expediting U.S. licensing of seabed mining, departing from international law to unleash what the administration called a ""gold rush” to ""counter China’s growing influence.” The country is set to conduct ISA-sanctioned tests of two seabed mining machines in the Pacific over the next year.

[Kenny Bolster, Senior Scientist at Viridian Biometals, holds a sample of polymetallic nodules at the Viridian Biometals lab in Pasadena, California on June 25th. | Wolf Image \/ via Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/5jtuyt5eieef1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=15839d178a05ebbe63e5bb387e14783aa0bb6856)

China already dominates the critical minerals supply chain on land, and TMC had successfully tapped into the U.S. president’s pursuit of China-free metals, expressed as a desire for dominion over Canada and Greenland. The global seabed, TMC repeatedly emphasized as it lobbied politicians and the White House, holds the planet’s largest estimated reserves of minerals like cobalt and nickel in the form of black rocks called polymetallic nodules. These cover the Pacific Ocean floor by the billions.

In an instant, Trump cleared the way for a race to the abyss to extract nodules, even though seabed mining technology remains under development and commercially unproven. At the ISA’s annual meeting in Kingston, Jamaica, delegates on Monday decried Trump’s move, with China’s representative denouncing the U.S. for ""unilateralist hegemonic acts” and attempting to ""replace the global standards with U.S. standards.”

Within days of Trump's order, Canadian-registered TMC’s U.S. subsidiary filed the world’s first application to mine the seabed in international waters, including an area it licenses from the ISA. An $85 million investment from a leading Korean metals processor soon followed. Nasdaq-listed TMC’s shares, which have periodically languished below a dollar, hit a 52-week high of $8.19 on Thursday.

A Silicon Valley startup called Impossible Metals, meanwhile, has applied for a license to explore and possibly mine nodules in U.S. waters off American Samoa, with an aim to raise $1 billion. Then on July 14, a top executive at U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin told the Financial Times the company is in talks to give seabed miners access to international areas of the Pacific it licenses from the U.S. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson declined to confirm the report but said, ""We appreciate the Trump administration’s focus on ensuring reliable sources of critical minerals, including the ocean.”

On Monday, delegates in Kingston ordered a report on ISA-licensed seabed miners at risk of violating their contracts with the body, a thinly veiled reference to TMC and other companies that might also seek to apply for U.S. licenses to mine in international waters.

The Trump-triggered seabed mining boom faces significant hurdles, though. While TMC has told investors it expects to begin mining within a year of receiving a license, the technology to extract minerals from the seabed at depths of four kilometers could be years away from being deployed at scale. Its competitiveness with terrestrial mining is unknown, as is the economic viability of processing and refining seabed minerals amid seesawing metal prices and the growing market share of battery technologies not reliant on nodule metals. The U.S. lacks such metallurgical capacity, and it could take years to bring online in the few countries outside of China with the potential to refine nodule minerals.

""Given the rapid evolution of batteries and other relevant technologies, there is great uncertainty about the future demand for critical minerals,” researchers at RAND wrote in a recent report. ""A seabed mining industry, as a whole, faces considerable opposition from nations and organizations concerned about the potential negative environmental impacts.”

**The White House did not respond to a request for comment.**

The countries that TMC relies on for seabed mining and processing technology are among the ISA’s 169 member nations (plus the European Union) that oppose unilateral mining in international waters. Amid such backlash, a Japanese corporation, Pacific Metals Company, that planned to process TMC’s nodules has now told investors that it would only ""launch operations once the international rules are finalized.”

""All those parties have a legal obligation to ensure that deep sea mining only takes place through the ISA,” says Samantha Robb, an Amsterdam-based attorney who specializes in ocean litigation.

At the ISA, delegates convened behind closed doors on Friday to debate how to respond to TMC’s plans. Barron, who once sat with the delegation of a tiny Pacific island nation that sponsors one of TMC’s ISA contracts, has been absent this year but he’s weighing in from afar. ""Amid some noisy grandstanding coming out of Jamaica this month, this is a good reminder ... the U.S. has every right to pursue seafloor resources in international waters,” he wrote Wednesday on X.

In a statement, TMC said it was ""on firm legal and regulatory footing,” citing the sizable investments it’s recently attracted. The company, however, cautioned investors in a May securities filing that a U.S. mining license wouldn’t be recognized internationally, which could affect ""logistics, processing and market access” for the seabed minerals TMC mines.

# ‘It’s going to take some time’

More than a thousand miles southwest of Mexico on a September morning in 2022, a yellow, 80-metric-ton machine slowly rumbled across the seabed on tank-like treads, a plume of sediment billowing behind. During a two-month test for TMC, the 38-foot-long prototype vacuumed up 3,000 metric tons of nodules, sending them through a tube to a specialized surface vessel called the Hidden Gem.

TMC hailed the trial as a success. Yet any commercial operations are a ways off, even if the U.S. grants TMC a mining license this year, given technological and legal obstacles that must be overcome.

[Matthew Lavichant, an intern at Viridian Biometals, plates wells in preparation for conducting a test on samples. | Wolf Image \/ via Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/g346bqnnieef1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e57fa872c711dcd1821897dafb9ef9db548729)

Allseas, a Dutch-owned, Swiss-registered offshore engineering and construction company, developed the technology, the world’s only working prototype of a nodule mining system. The company supplies the apparatus to TMC and is its second-largest shareholder. To meet TMC’s production targets, it must now build a much bigger version capable of harvesting nodules nearly around the clock under crushing pressure far from shore.

A U.S. seabed mining license, however, would require TMC to deploy American-built and owned vessels. How the companies would comply with that mandate is unclear. Allseas said in a statement that it would take about two years to engineer the technical systems to support full-scale mining but it won’t begin that work ""until we are confident that all relevant regulatory conditions are met.” Allseas, which itself owns an ISA-licensed seabed mining company, has come under pressure from Dutch politicians and activists not to provide technology for unilateral mining.

TMC says it can’t comment while its U.S. mining license application is under review. But in a May 14 securities filing the company said it’s ""evaluating U.S.-based vessel” options. However, the U.S. hasn’t built a specialized seabed mining ship like the Hidden Gem, and only eight U.S. ocean-going bulk cargo carriers — large ships that can hold tens of thousands of pounds of nodules and transport them to shore — are in service. Seven of them are at or near the end of their lifespan, according to a 2024 U.S. Maritime Administration report.

Impossible Metals uses a nodule collector, called Eureka, that’s designed to hover above the ocean floor, its robotic claws selecting individual nodules that its artificial intelligence program determines aren’t inhabited by marine organisms. (Scientists estimate that at least 30% to 40% of deep ocean life in the seabed targeted for mining live on nodules.)

The company has delayed a planned trial of the Eureka in an ISA-licensed area of the Pacific until at least 2027 because the technology needs further refinement. And any mining wouldn’t happen until at least the early 2030s. Impossible Metals’ mining license application is for U.S. waters, not areas controlled by ISA. ""That’s far less controversial,” said CEO Oliver Gunasekara. ""But obviously it’s going to take some time.”

# What it takes to process a nodule

In a small lab in Pasadena, California, scientists at an Impossible Metals spinoff called Viridian Biometals are trying to crack a problem about as challenging as pulling nodules out of the abyss: getting the metals out of the nodules.

Nodule minerals precipitate out of seawater, forming layers around a piece of whale bone, a shark tooth or another small object at the rate of a few millimeters every million years. Unlike terrestrial minerals, where a couple of different metals might be found together in a deposit, nodules contain nickel, cobalt and copper particles scattered throughout every rock, mostly embedded in a matrix of manganese oxide.

""The treatment of materials that contain all four of these elements is not something that is commercially done today,” said Lyle Trytten, a veteran of the metals processing industry and president of Canada-based Trytten Consulting Services.

Viridian scientists are tinkering with rock-breathing microbes that oxidize nodules to extract the most valuable metals. On a June afternoon, senior scientist Kenny Bolster opens up what looks like a freezer to reveal stainless steel bioreactors. As microbes inside oxide the manganese bits, they release nickel, cobalt and copper ions into a solution.

""All this happens at ambient temperature and pressure, which saves an enormous amount of energy and doesn’t produce any toxic waste,” says Viridian CEO Eric Macris.

***\*\*\*\*\*It’ll take a few years to assess whether the technology is likely to be commercially feasible. ""We love what Viridian is doing but we’re just not sure if it will be mature enough when we need it,” says Impossible Metals’ Gunasekara.\*\*\*\*\****

If TMC, Impossible Metals and other companies mine the ocean floor under a U.S. license, then federal law requires the minerals to be processed and refined in America. Aside from Viridian’s early efforts, the U.S. has no such capacity.

A single facility in the U.S. capable of processing and refining nodules would cost several billion dollars, and could take up to a decade to reach full production, in part due to the complexities of handling an entirely new feedstock, according to Niels Verbaan, director of metallurgy technical services for Swiss testing and certification company SGS.

The U.S. tax and spending bill enacted on July 4 allocates $5.5 billion to the Department of Defense for investments in critical minerals supply chains. But the U.S. has suffered a precipitous decline in metallurgical expertise since the 1980s when universities began to eliminate related degree programs. ""We are decades behind now, and it’s going to be very hard to catch up,” says Corby Anderson, a professor of metallurgical and materials engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. New immigration restrictions will also make it harder to recruit engineering talent from overseas.

China has invested heavily in the industry and is now in a position to retrofit existing facilities to process nodules or build dedicated new plants. The country processes 74% of the world’s cobalt ore, according to a 2024 report from the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank, while 97% of global nickel ore processing capacity lies outside of North America. China also maintains more than 80% of the capacity for refining those metals into advanced EV battery materials.

There’s few existing facilities outside of China capable of handling nodules, even if a U.S. seabed miner receives permission to use them and the owners are willing to revamp operations, according to industry executives. ""These processing plants are not just sitting there idle begging for feed, they’re all in use today,” says Trytten.

# The ‘blue whale’ in the room

TMC has found one overseas metals processor willing to make the switch. Last year, Pacific Metals Company of Japan fed a 2,000-ton pile of nodules collected by TMC in 2022 into an electric-arc furnace to produce 500 tons of a material. In February, it was smelted into a nickel-cobalt-copper alloy.

""These process plants are very expensive to build, they’re very complicated, they’re very risky,” says Jeffrey Donald, TMC’s head of onshore development. ""So by using an existing asset, existing operators, you’re really taking that capital off the front end and you're really de-risking the technology and operations aspect.”

In April, Pacific Metals announced it would transition from processing nickel ore to smelting nodules. But it doesn’t expect full production to begin until 2029 at the earliest.

TMC has also struck a deal with metals giant Korea Zinc, which is assessing the feasibility of refining nodules into battery materials, a process TMC has so far tested only in the lab.

Whether nations would be enabling deep-sea mining through commercial relationships with U.S.-licensed seabed mining companies was the subject of whispered conversations among ISA delegates this month as they continued drafting mining regulations. Trump’s move to mine in international waters and TMC’s defiance of the ISA was, as French ambassador Olivier Guyonvarch alluded, ""the blue whale” in the room.

The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea prohibits unilateral mining by any country or corporation. It also requires the ISA to administer the global seabed for the benefit of humanity, with any royalties from mining divided among member states. The U.S. never ratified the treaty, though it had generally adhered to its provisions and still participates in ISA proceedings as an observer.

Pressure is growing on member states to not supply technology to seabed mining companies the U.S. licenses, process their nodules or buy metals from them, as the treaty mandates ISA countries treat unilateral mining as illegitimate. Thirty-seven ISA countries support a moratorium on seabed mining until its environmental impacts are better understood.

""The risks of bypassing the ISA’s oversight are not only legal, they are also economic,” ISA Secretary-General Leticia Carvalho said in a statement. ""Product lines derived from ventures that violate international law will carry reputational and legal concerns that increase the risk of the investment and can undermine its return.”

Pacific Metals appears to have gotten the message. In a recent investor briefing, the company, which did not respond to requests for comment, emphasized that when it comes to nodule processing, it considers ""international credibility to be a material issue.”

# July 22nd, 2025~U.S. Backs Critical Minerals, Creating Tailwinds for Sunrise and Clean TeQ’s MBIX Technology

[U.S. Backs Critical Minerals, Creating Tailwinds for Sunrise and Clean TeQ’s MBIX Technology](https://news.marketersmedia.com/us-backs-critical-minerals-creating-tailwinds-for-sunrise-and-clean-teqs-mbix-technology/89165227)

https://preview.redd.it/47lnabkcheef1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=edbb6a7933dd1a382e0a40bc4d0000ba76443bb4

# A Long-Term Relationship with Growing Commercial Potential

A leader in advanced hydrometallurgical technology through its Moving Bed Ion Exchange (MBIX) platform, Clean TeQ is finalising a feasibility study for [Sunrise’s Syerston Scandium Project](https://www.sunriseem.com/advanced-lightweight-alloys/).

The study forms part of a long-standing strategic relationship with Sunrise and builds on earlier work demonstrating the effectiveness of MBIX to produce high-purity scandium oxide for solid oxide fuel cells, aluminium-scandium alloys, semiconductors and next-generation defence and aviation materials.

Clean TeQ’s relationship with Sunrise dates back to 2014, when it acquired the Syerston Nickel Cobalt Project – the host of the scandium resource. In 2021, Clean TeQ was renamed Sunrise Energy Metals Limited and Clean TeQ Water was established and listed as a separate entity on the ASX.

# Vested Interest in Success

In a landmark July 2025 transaction, the U.S. Department of Defence became the largest shareholder in MP Materials, investing $400 million for a 15% equity stake. The agreement includes a decade-long offtake commitment for rare earth magnets and a strategic supply guarantee for domestic defence needs.

“The MP Materials deal sent a clear message: the U.S. is not just supporting critical minerals projects diplomatically – it is now funding them directly,” said a Washington-based critical minerals policy analyst.

This precedent creates a strong case for U.S. equity and offtake support for other shovel-ready critical mineral assets globally, and demonstrates that the US is committed to the success of effective, commercial scale mine development.

# MBIX in Action: Proven Results

In 2016, Clean TeQ’s proprietary MBIX technology demonstrated its ability to efficiently extract scandium using a resin-in-pulp (RIP) process, in which ion exchange resins are directly contacted with leached slurry. This achieved an extraction rate of more than 98% of contained metal in solution.

**Ion exchange resins used in MBIX are ideal for recovery and concentration of lower concentration metals. Compared with conventional flowsheets, they offer the potential for lower capital and operating costs, uniquely positioning Clean TeQ to support Sunrise in unlocking high-grade scandium from its laterite resource.**

Strategic Supply, Renewable Advantage

Sunrise offers several strategic advantages likely to appeal to investors:

* High scandium concentrations
* Renewable-powered operations planned for ESG leadership
* Ready-to-scale production flowsheet
* Simple and shallow mining

Outlook

With scandium’s role in energy, aerospace, and defence rising sharply – and with the U.S. now demonstrating its willingness to take direct equity positions in strategic projects – Sunrise may become a cornerstone of allied critical mineral supply. Clean TeQ, as its technology linchpin, stands to benefit from this shifting industrial and geopolitical landscape.

# 🧲 How the $45 Million Raise ""Might"" Propel Elk Creek Forward

|Strategic Role|Action Enabled by $45M Raise|
|:-|:-|
||
|Site Readiness & Infrastructure🏗|Funds utility tie-ins (power, gas, water) + land consolidation—key for full operational control|
|Long-Lead Equipment Procurements⚙️|Orders critical items like rotary dryers & Nb/Sc separation units with 12–18 mo delivery time|
|De-risking for Government Funding🧭|Makes Elk Creek financing-ready for U.S. DoD, Ex-Im, or UKEF participation|

|National Security Supply Chain🛡|4 critical mineralsStrengthens domestic control of (REEs, Nb, Sc, Ti) in a single U.S. asset|

# 🧩 Strategic Synthesis: Why This Moment Matters

* The **$45 million raise** isn’t speculative — it’s surgical: enabling pre-construction utilities, land control, and equipment timelines that match a **federal fast-track blueprint**.
* Horn’s position in Trump-world, defense policy, and the Energy Dominance Council means ***Elk Creek is no longer just a mining project — it’s now being slotted into the U.S. national security-industrial complex.***
* Together, the raise + backchannel coordination signal this: **⏳ NioCorp is preparing to break ground the moment institutional capital clears**

# ⚖️ Final Rank Summary for NioCorp (Elk Creek)

🔹 Second only to Mountain Pass, but unique for offering multi-metal critical supply from one site  
🔹 With the $45M raise, Elk Creek transitions from “permitted potential” to pre-construction execution  
🔹 **A strategic twin to MP—especially if DoD offtake, Ex-Im loan, or OEM magnet partner materializes in 20**2**5**

# 🧠 Strategic Summary Speculation~

NioCorp’s $45 million capital raise via Maxim is a **deliberate activation step**, shifting Elk Creek from “promising” to **“shovel-ready.”** Modeled on MP Materials’ 2019–2022 development path, the funds might be deployed across critical infrastructure, long-lead equipment, final land control, and early-stage procurement, enabling EPC readiness by 2026. 

Power, gas, and water access could be locked in, while key processing systems are ordered to align with 12–18 month lead times — **A calculated move to synchronize construction with anticipated DoD or export credit funding (Ex-Im/UKEF).** 

This phased mobilization approach may signal an aggressive timeline toward full-scale construction, while paralleling MP’s magnetics playbook — but with broader critical mineral output: **Niobium, Scandium, Titanium (TiCl₄), and REEs.** 

# It marks a strategic inflection point for the Elk Creek Project and positions NioCorp as a next-in-line U.S. supply chain anchor. IMHO...

While this convenience has revolutionized the way we live and work, it has also opened doors to a darker threat cybercrime. Enter cyber security services, your digital defense system in an increasingly interconnected and vulnerable world. Whether you're a solo entrepreneur, a student, or the CEO of a billion-dollar enterprise, one thing is clear: you need Secure Cyber Help.

https://preview.redd.it/lesb0q06teef1.jpg?width=5824&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b47015b985233793cbe7c015a60fbbd28bc9ccca

This guide reveals the positive impact of modern [cyber security services](https://thenoblehackers.com/#) how they protect, empower, and evolve with businesses and individuals alike. Let’s dive into the surprising truth behind this vital digital armor.

# What Are Cyber Security Services, Really?

Cyber security services refer to professional support systems designed to protect your data, networks, and systems from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and data breaches. These services go beyond installing antivirus software—they involve real-time monitoring, threat detection, risk analysis, data encryption, firewall management, and much more.

In short, they are the frontline warriors of your digital world.

# Why Everyone—Yes, Even You—Needs Them

You may be thinking, “I'm not a big target. Why would someone hack me?” That’s exactly what many people thought—until they got hit with ransomware, phishing attacks, or identity theft. Hackers don't always target the rich or famous; they often go after the unprepared.

Cyber security services are no longer a luxury. They’re a necessity, and here's why:

* **Remote Work Boom**: With more people working from home, security vulnerabilities have increased.
* **Data Explosion**: Every online action creates data—and that data is valuable.
* **Automated Attacks**: Hackers use bots and AI to launch automated cyberattacks, targeting the weak links.
* **Cloud Dependency**: Storing files in the cloud makes data management easier, but it also raises security concerns.

# Types of Cyber Security Services You Should Know

Let’s break down the key services that form a complete cyber defense strategy:

# 1. Network Security

Protects your internal networks from intrusions and malware. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and antivirus solutions all fall under this category.

# 2. Endpoint Security

Each device you use—your phone, laptop, or tablet—is an entry point. Endpoint protection ensures these devices are secured and constantly monitored.

# 3. Cloud Security

As businesses move to platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, cloud security becomes essential. These services protect cloud-stored data from breaches and leaks.

# 4. Email Security

Phishing emails are still one of the top methods hackers use. Cyber security services include tools that scan and block malicious emails before they reach your inbox.

# 5. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Prevents sensitive data from being lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users.

# 6. Incident Response

In case of a cyberattack, incident response teams act fast to contain and eliminate threats, minimizing damage and restoring operations.

# 7. Vulnerability Assessments & Pen Testing

These services evaluate your system for weaknesses and simulate attacks to find vulnerabilities before hackers do.

# The Benefits: Why Cyber Security Services Are a Game-Changer

Implementing cyber security services is like giving your organization a digital immune system. Here’s what you gain:

* **Peace of Mind**: You sleep better knowing your systems are guarded 24/7.
* **Reputation Protection**: Data breaches damage your brand. Prevention protects your image.
* **Customer Trust**: Consumers are more likely to do business with companies that prioritize cyber safety.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Cyber services help meet legal requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
* **Cost Savings**: Preventing a cyberattack is significantly cheaper than recovering from one.

# Small Business? Here’s Why You Still Need Secure Cyber Help

Think cybercriminals only target big corporations? Think again.

60% of small businesses shut down within six months of a cyberattack. Without a dedicated IT team or robust digital infrastructure, small and medium businesses are often the easiest targets.

That’s where professional cyber security services come in. With Secure Cyber Help, even small businesses can access:

* Affordable managed security services
* Expert consultation
* 24/7 monitoring without hiring full-time staff
* Custom solutions for unique needs

Cyber security levels the playing field.

# Cyber Security & AI: A Winning Duo

The future of cyber security is bright—and smarter than ever.

Modern services now use artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect threats faster than any human team could. Predictive analytics can stop cyberattacks before they even start. AI doesn’t replace human experts; it amplifies their abilities.

Some benefits include:

* Real-time threat detection
* Faster incident response
* Improved threat intelligence sharing
* Automated security tasks

By combining human expertise with machine intelligence, Secure Cyber Help becomes more powerful, proactive, and future-ready.

# Meet “Secure Cyber Help”: Your Partner in Digital Defense

“Secure Cyber Help” isn’t just a catchy phrase. It’s the embodiment of modern, efficient, and trustworthy cyber security services.

Whether it’s through a top-tier managed security service provider or a dedicated in-house team, Secure Cyber Help includes:

* Personalized security assessments
* Scalable solutions for any size of organization
* Hands-on response during a crisis
* Ongoing education and awareness training

Think of it as your **digital wellness plan**—preventive, protective, and empowering.

# How to Choose the Right Cyber Security Services

Ready to take action? Here are a few tips when selecting a cyber security partner:

1. **Check Credentials**: Look for certifications like CISSP, CEH, or CISM.
2. **Industry Experience**: Ensure they’ve worked in your field (healthcare, finance, education, etc.).
3. **Scalability**: As your business grows, your security needs will too.
4. **Round-the-Clock Support**: Cyber threats don’t follow a 9-to-5 schedule—your service shouldn’t either.
5. **Transparency**: Make sure their process and pricing are clear.

# Final Thoughts: Don’t Wait for a Cyber Attack to Strike

In 2025 and beyond, cyber security is not optional. It’s as important as your product, your people, and your profits. Every second without protection is a second your data could be at risk",1,1753183025.0,u_Difficult_Cat2573,0,1.0,False

Here is a summary of the timeline/events leading up to the breakup that blindsided me. 

My dad called me early spring to let me know that he has cancer again for a second time. Obviously not great news but I was in a really good place mentally and was positive about his care/treatment. In hindsight I feel like I withdrew a little and coped with the news of my dads illness by avoiding thinking about it too much and so I started spending time in my evenings playing an online game with my friend from another country who recently lost his mother to cancer. It was a nice outlet and I felt safe having some me time with a trusted friend.

After a few weeks my girlfriend expressed that she felt a bit bored and lonely in the evenings and that we should be more active in planning a date night once a week and she expressed some resentment toward feeling that I was not doing enough around the house. I ln response I started planning date nights and setup an online schedule to track housework and dog care however she never really made as much effort in planning date night and the housework/dog care tracking she never really engaged with. I assume she was just really busy with work where our usual dynamic is to pick up the slack for each other when work was busy. 

It was at this point I started to feel like she was emotionally withdrawing. This triggered some anxiety for me as something felt off and I became more attentive checking in with her but to no avail. I noticed that despite being distant with me she was spending a lot of time on her phone and I assumed she was having long conversations with her friends. 

In our relationship we would frequently use each other’s phones for various reasons (I usually used her phone to take better pictures of our dogs because it was a newer model) and I assumed we always had nothing to hide from each other. While in her camera roll I checked her recently deleted photos out of curiosity and found a screenshot (possibly an accidental screenshot) of an inappropriate conversation she was having with a guy on Instagram that I did not know. 

I went onto her Instagram account and found a hidden conversation between her and this married man (an old college friend). 

Their conversation involved the following:

- talking about how they used to fancy each other in college. 
- Mention of a meet up for coffee which I did not know about
- She disclosed a lot of very personal details about my mental health and medical history 
- He complimented her a lot calling her very beautiful and gorgeous
- He was self aware that he was being inappropriate and said it would be okay if she did not want to speak with him again
- She continued to talk/entertain him despite knowing their conversations were not appropriate and crossed boundaries for their respective partners 

I confronted my girlfriend immediately and calmly asking her who this person was. She was instantly defensive and repeatedly downplayed & denied any wrongdoing. 

Over the next few days we argued somewhat. I wanted her to acknowledge that she had crossed a boundary, hurt me and that I was making an effort to process my feelings in a healthy way but she consistently invalidated my feelings with statements like “I did nothing wrong”. I considered it a form of emotional cheating. 

Eventually our arguments peaked when after constantly feeling invalidated and unheard I lost my temper and yelled nasty and hurtful things to her as a way of lashing out to feel heard. She cried and I immediately stopped this emotional outburst to console her. We made up and I thought everything was fine although I was still hurt by the emotional cheating which had not been addressed because of the escalation of the arguments. The next day she spent the day out, we planned to have lunch together but she never came home until the evening where she and her female friend came back to our apartment told me she needed space and left. I did not know where she went and she did not return for 5 days after which she broke up with me when she returned and asked that I leave the apartment which we co-own. Out of respect for her I complied and took two of our dogs to stay with my parents and support my father through his cancer treatment where I have been ever since. Before leaving the apartment she initiated sexual intimacy which further confused me and she later referred to this as a “goodbye” which deeply hurt me. 

Throughout this entire saga of events she has been supported by several longtime & new female friends who I believe have been coaching her through the breakup and influencing her on what to do and say. Because of this I feel like these 3rd parties have been consistently talking through her and influencing her view on our relationship. 

Since the breakup my ex has been extremely hostile towards and extremely nasty. She becomes extremely upset to learn that I have been spending my time away from her making significant work on self improvement by hitting the gym, increasing therapy sessions, perusing a new job in another city, working on finally getting my driving licence.  

Some of the statements she has made to me are:

- “I am happier than ever” when asked how she is doing emotionally after the breakup
- “I don’t think you ever actually cared about me”
- “You can only use your dad’s cancer as an excuse so much”
- “It was just a goodbye” when asked why she initiated sexual intimacy after breaking up with me.
- “Only 13 years too late” when mentioning I am working on getting my driving licence.  

I understand that she is hurting and lashing out, trying to hurt me/push me away or get a negative reaction to enforce her narrative that I am a bad person and avoid processing of any guilt. I feel like it is much easier for her reframe me as a villain to avoid feelings related to her part in the end of the relationship. 

I don’t take these nasty comments too seriously, however they are upsetting to hear and they do make me second guess myself; if I am actually a bad person. I am not a perfect boyfriend but I love her deeply, care for more than anyone in the world and I felt like we had such a strong relationship right up until the breakup. It completely blindsided me and in the aftermath it has been really difficult to be treated like a villain. 

I am still open to reconciliation, in fact I want nothing else but It just feels hopeless between the influences of her friends, the character assassination and narrative build around me in order to help her justify her decision & avoid  any emotional fallout through painting me as a villain. 

I don’t feel like I did enough to justify being treated so badly post-breakup but I constantly doubt myself. I know I could have done better but I feel really unfairly treated.  What is your take on my breakup?

I think she’s really smart, really sweet, and obviously really beautiful. Her glasses are cute but so are her eyes without them. I have a “type” and she’s all that and a bag of chips. She’s helped me a lot in the new job I took on. We’ve had to work on some projects together and she’s actually taught me more than planned and she’s filled some gaps that leadership clearly didn’t . I’m obviously grateful to her for her help, and since I’m crushing on her I told her I owed her coffee if we ever were both in the office. That was a start, but I’d certainly offer more. This was on a phone call though, she didn’t say yes or didn’t say no but I imagined she smiled and I heard her laugh. We had to talk online again this week , she asked how my weekend went and I told her it was okay and I was trying to make the most of the great summer weather outdoors . I asked her about hers she said it was quiet. I wanted to ask more but I just semi froze. I could’ve asked more  but I didn’t know if I’d come off aggressive especially after my coffee comment but maybe I’m reading too much into it. We usually don’t see each other in person unless she has to go in which is almost never. I know two of her hobbies from group calls but she’s usually quiet when people ask about everyone’s weekend. I’m also new so I have to go in. I obviously don’t want her to get in any trouble, neither do I for that matter . I did meet a girl at another job but we were in different offices so when we broke up, yes it was tough but we didn’t share an office. There was one girl who semi asked me to meet at an event ; we got tickets and then she bailed . We did share an office and just shook it off. This was after I asked her for coffee separate from our happy hour group and she didn’t say anything.I know my new coworker we’re both adults too and would have to handle it that way . I know it’s usually not the best idea but I like her all around, and what I’ve learned is if you don’t try taking a shot, someone else may and then you really can’t .

## Key Features Analysis

Italian tea brands distinguish themselves through a commitment to quality and a focus on incorporating regional ingredients and flavors.

**High-Quality Ingredients:** Italian tea brands often prioritize sourcing the finest ingredients, whether it's premium tea leaves from around the world or locally grown herbs and fruits.

This dedication to quality ensures a flavorful and aromatic cup of tea. Many brands emphasize organic and sustainable farming practices, ensuring both the health of the consumer and the environment. The use of natural, unprocessed ingredients contributes to a cleaner, more authentic taste.

**Unique Blends and Flavors:** Italian tea makers excel at creating unique and innovative blends that reflect the country's diverse culinary heritage.

These blends often incorporate Mediterranean herbs like rosemary, sage, and thyme, as well as citrus fruits like lemon and orange. This results in teas that are both refreshing and complex, offering a distinct departure from traditional tea flavors. The artful combination of these ingredients creates a symphony of tastes that tantalize the palate.

**Traditional Processing Methods:** Many Italian tea brands adhere to traditional processing methods, preserving the integrity and flavor of the tea leaves and herbs.

This can include hand-picking the leaves, slow drying techniques, and careful attention to detail throughout the production process. These methods ensure that the tea retains its natural oils and aromas, resulting in a more flavorful and nuanced cup. The commitment to traditional methods reflects a deep respect for the history and art of tea making.

**Elegant Packaging and Presentation:** Italian tea brands often pay close attention to the packaging and presentation of their products.

**Boosted Immunity:** Many Italian teas are rich in antioxidants and vitamins that can help boost the immune system.

Herbs like elderflower, rosehip, and echinacea are often added to teas for their immune-boosting properties. These teas can help protect the body against illness and promote overall health. The antioxidants in these teas help fight free radicals and reduce oxidative stress.

**Increased Energy and Focus:** Some Italian teas contain caffeine or other natural stimulants that can help increase energy and focus.

Black tea, green tea, and yerba mate are common ingredients that can provide a gentle boost of energy without the jitters or crash associated with coffee. These teas can be a great alternative to coffee for those who are looking for a more sustained and balanced energy boost. The caffeine in these teas can help improve alertness, concentration, and cognitive function.

I've been watching *Young Sheldon* and noticed a possible continuity hiccup involving Sheryl, the woman who gets tackled by Pastor Jeff's wife and later stays with the Coopers.

In **Season 1, Episode 11** (""Demons, Sunday School, and Prime Numbers""), Sheryl explicitly tells Sheldon that she's a **Mormon**. As someone familiar with the faith, this stood out to me because Mormons generally follow something called the **Word of Wisdom** — a health code that prohibits **coffee, tea, alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs**.

Fast forward to **Season 3, Episode 18** (""A Couple Bruised Ribs and a Cereal Box Ghost Detector"") — Sheryl is recovering from the football tackle and staying at the Coopers'. George brings her **donuts and coffee**, and she seems to accept it without comment. No objection, no “oh I don’t drink coffee,” nothing. It just struck me as odd, especially since her faith was already established earlier in the show.

Of course, it’s possible she’s no longer active in the church or doesn’t strictly follow the health code, but it felt a little inconsistent, especially for a show that usually pays attention to these character details.

I have been in recovery for about 2 years now but only have had a few blocks of rest, around a few weeks at a time, since the start of recovery to properly rest. The rest of the time I am busy with University and work. In general, I just feel tired even though i did not do alot in the day, usually starting the day quite late at around 10am. I'll start to feel fatigued at around 5pm. Coffee doesn't seem to help at all.

These are the two posts below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/s/NENPlCHRMM](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/s/NENPlCHRMM)  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/s/K9GRn4pHZq](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/s/K9GRn4pHZq)

The comments from the posts recommended that I just sleep and give in to the sleep during the recovery phase. Rest in bed, do somatic exercises, stretching and body movements to awaken the nervous system.

I have had 1 really fat mid day nap, which was unprompted. I woke up feeling very clear, or at least there was a quiet peace that came with waking up, it reminds of one of the naps i used to have as a child, waking up and hearing the sound of the fan or environment, head empty without thoughts about what I had to do that day.

I still have alot on my plate in terms of daily responsibilities because I live alone and have to do some work for projects during the day, so I don't think I can afford to sleep in every day haha. Would love to but i still need to put in around 6-8 hours of laptop work every day. I do want to integrate somemore time to slowdown and recharge somatically to heal.

What helps the most? Is it better to do a full week of pure recovery, minimise work and just focus on resting? Like a holiday? Or is it more helpful to carve out a few hours a day to do something that recharges you? 

Anyone can chime in with advice on how to recover and recharge from this kind of fatigue? Feel free to share your own experience or whatever routines/activities that helped you specifically in your journey!

The girl walks in. Seven. Cute as a button. Knees always bruised, backpack swinging off one shoulder. Hood up if it’s cold. Braids if it’s Thursday.

Nobody talks when she enters. Not really. Some men stop mid-sentence, and sip their coffee. Others suddenly remember to check their watches.

She walks past ex-cons, drunks, quiet old men with hands that still shake from what they’ve seen.

She taps the counter twice. That’s her thing.

“Pickles. In a napkin. Please.”

That’s all she ever says.

The owner — woman in her late fifties, grey apron, sleeves rolled up, eyes like a mechanic who’s seen engines catch fire — doesn’t blink. She goes to the private jar under the counter.

Every day, same routine.

She places the napkin with the pickles in front of the little girl, who doesn’t say thank you, doesn’t make a face, doesn’t fidget. She just sits down at the corner stool, the one with the torn cushion, and eats each pickle like it’s the only thing she’s doing that day.

One time, someone new tried to make a joke. One of those ex-military types that doesn’t know how to read a room. Something dumb about her being someone’s kid. No one responded. The next day, he didn’t come back. Didn’t pick up his check from the shop next door. People noticed, but no one said anything.

The girl’s family is normal. Painfully, beautifully normal. Her mother works at a tailor shop, or used to. Word is she’s planning to quit and help her husband with the cattle. The man raises cattle out past the hills. Long days. Dirt fingernails. One of those soft-spoken guys who looks like he could crush a man if he ever stood up straight. But that’s not the reason.

The only reason anyone in that room thinks twice about this girl is because of her great-grandfather. His picture isn’t on any wall. You’d have to be invited to the back room to see it. Black and white. Heavy coat. Eyes like blade left outside in winter. Some say he built the tunnels under the block. Others say he buried things in them. He’s the reason the neighborhood didn’t fall apart like the others. He gave it rules, boundaries and blood.

People who’ve seen his picture just nod when it’s mentioned.

And there are whispers about this little girl, of course. Always are.

That she doesn’t blink when she eats, that she once watched someone get dragged out the back without turning her head, that she carries something sharp in her sock, that her mom told her the rules by the time she was five, that she’s never once asked for a second napkin.

You can believe what you want. That’s what keeps the stories alive.

But what people know is this: every day at 4:15, she walks in. Sits down. Eats. Folds the napkin into clean, perfect squares. Leaves them on the counter like tiny graves. Walks out.

And the grown men in the shop, the ones with bad records and worse regrets, sit there. Waiting for the bell to ring again.

Because nobody touches that girl.",3,1753182347.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Jul 21 2025

Chapter 1: The Wedding.

That wedding dress wasn’t mine. Those guests weren’t mine. That gold ring that would be placed on my finger wasn’t mine. That groom at the altar wasn’t mine.

When I entered the church and all eyes turned to me, it felt like a silent accusation. They knew that the ceremony was theater.

My heart was beating fast, and my head was spinning, telling me to get out of there. For a minute, I looked at the door behind me, but it only took Dad’s hard stare to make me take the first step.

“Come on, Laura, you can do it,” I muttered to myself.

As I approached the altar, he was there. James, wearing his expensive dark suit, his hair gelled and his face impatiently.

I smiled under my veil, trying to disguise my nervousness, but he didn’t even look in my direction.

While the priest was giving a beautiful sermon about the wedding, I could see how irritated he was. James put the ring on my finger with such force that I let out a groan of pain.

By the time the priest said, “I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.”

He left the church without looking back, leaving me alone at the altar.

“Enjoy the party,” he shouted from the doorway.

The whispers started as a low hum and grew until they echoed throughout the church. I felt my face burn under the veil as I stood paralyzed at the altar, the bouquet trembling in my hands, and an overwhelming desire to cry.

“Laura, congratulations on the wedding,” someone said.

I couldn’t reply.

The air left my lungs as if I had been punched. My legs went weak, and I had to lean on the altar to keep from falling.

The bouquet slipped from my numb fingers and fell to the floor with a dull thud. Every word the guests said was like a new stab in my chest. I looked at my father, silently begging him to help me. But his face was pale, his eyes shifted to the floor.

“Laura...” someone said next to me, but I was already running.

I crossed the church aisle like a white blur, tripping over the dress that wasn’t mine, tearing off the veil that was stifling my sobs. The guests stood up in their places, but no one tried to stop me.

My trembling hands pushed open the church door, but at that moment a powerful hand grabbed my arm, its fingers digging into my skin like claws. The grip was familiar - my father always knew exactly how much force to use to hurt without leaving marks on my skin.

“Laura, don’t embarrass the family,” he hissed close to my ear, his voice calm but laden with menace. “Let’s go to the party. There’s a big celebration waiting for us.”

“What’s there to celebrate?”

The drive to the ballroom was a silent torture in the back of the limousine. My stepmother Eva kept complaining about how I had “ruined” the perfect ceremony she had planned. Her words mingled with the noise of the engine, turning into an irritating hum as I watched the city pass by the window, feeling like a prisoner on her way to her sentence.

“You need to smile,” my father ordered, his eyes meeting mine.

There was no warmth in his words, just the coldness of a business executive closing yet another deal.

Eva shifted in her seat. She displayed a fake concern on her face.

“The wedding day is the happiest day in a woman’s life,” she declared in that sugary voice she always used in public. “All the magazines say so.”

I felt a solitary tear run down my cheek as I looked at my hands, the wedding ring shining like a golden handcuff.

“Then why do I feel so sad?”

“You’ve always been dramatic,” Eva replied with an exasperated sigh, exchanging a complicated glance with my father. “Just like your mother.”

The mention of my mother was like a slap, but I swallowed the words I wanted to say. After all, that’s what they expected of me - to swallow the pain, smile and pretend that this really was the happiest day of my life.

“You married one of the richest men in the country; you should be happy,” my father argued.

“I don’t care about money. I wanted to marry for love,” I mumbled.

I arrived at the party, and everything was very luxurious.

Crystal lights reflected off the polished marble, creating an ethereal atmosphere in the hall. Silver candlesticks adorned the tables covered with champagne silk tablecloths, while elaborate arrangements of white orchids perfumed the room.

“Where’s James?” one guest whispered to another as I walked past.

I tried to keep my smile as I walked between the tables, feeling the looks of pity and curiosity following me. The bridal waltz began to play, but there was no one to dance with me.

“Laura, darling,” James’ mother approached, her smile as fake as the pearls around my neck. “James had an emergency at work. You understand, don’t you? He’s a very busy man.”

“Of course, Mrs. Reynolds,” I replied mechanically.

The five-tiered cake remained untouched, a masterpiece in shades of ivory and gold that no one dared to cut. The champagne glasses were filled and emptied quickly, as if the guests were trying to drown their embarrassment.

“This is unacceptable,” I heard my father mutter to Eva. “He won’t even take my calls.”

“Laura,” my cousin Alice approached, her eyes full of genuine concern. “You don’t have to stay here.”

“Yes, I do,” I whispered, looking at the empty seat next to me at the head table. “This is my punishment, isn’t it?”

“I told you to run away, too.”

A server passed by, offering more champagne. I took a glass and drank it in one gulp, feeling the bubbly liquid burn my throat along with the tears I refused to shed.

“Let’s make a toast to the bride and groom!” someone shouted, clearly drunk.

The silence that followed was deafening.

“Smile, Laura,” Eva whispered, squeezing my shoulder. “The photographers are still here.”

The orchestra continued playing romantic songs to a room where love was conspicuously absent, as was the groom.

After saying goodbye to the last guest, I went to the bedroom and, to my surprise, my husband was there. Sitting in a leather armchair, a document in his hands and an expression of utter contempt on his face.

“Are you in here?” I asked nervously.

“This is my room.”

I looked around, and everything was as cold as the man in front of me. His blue eyes were like icebergs in the northern seas.

“Let me make the terms very clear,” he said, his voice as sharp as ice. “First, you’re not my real wife. This is a business arrangement.”

I stood, still wearing the wedding dress that wasn’t mine, while he leafed through the contract.

“Second, you will sleep in the guest room at the end of the corridor. Or on the floor, if you prefer. I don’t mind.”

“I’m not quitting my job,” I declared, surprising us both with the firmness in my voice.

James looked up from the document, a cruel smile forming on his lips. “Oh, yes, you are. A wife from the Reynolds family doesn’t work in just any bookshop.”

“You can’t make me.”

“I can and I will,” he stood up, approaching like a predator. “Or have you forgotten the deal your father made? The debt he owes me? All it takes is one phone call from me to the lawyers, and your father will spend the rest of his life in jail.”

I felt my eyes sting with restrained tears. “But I like my job.”

“Too bad.”

“What else is in this contract?”

“Public appearances when necessary. Family dinners on Sundays. Smiles at social events,” he listed coldly. “And, of course, absolute secrecy about the nature of our arrangement.”

“For how long?”

“Until I decide it’s over.” James threw the contract on the bed. “Sign the last page. And Laura...” he paused in the doorway, “don’t kid yourself that this will ever change. My heart belongs to someone else.”

I picked up the pen with trembling fingers, each word of the contract weighing like lead in my chest.

He looked at me for a few seconds. “Laura, don’t ever wear fake jewelry again; that’s ridiculous.”

I touched my necklace in shame.

“Welcome to hell, Ms. Reynolds,” he said before leaving, leaving me alone with my new reality.

I let my body collapse onto the bed and cried.

Chapter 2: The Morning After

The next morning, the breakfast room of the Reynolds mansion was a masterpiece in shades of cream and gold. The morning light streamed through the French windows, making the fine china sparkle on the impeccably set table.

“Good morning, dear daughter-in-law,” Mrs. Reynolds said as I entered, her voice too sweet to be sincere. “I hope you slept well in the guest room.”

I blushed as I realized that she knew exactly where I had spent the night. I think everyone did.

“Coffee’s served, ma’am,” the housekeeper announced, placing a tray of freshly baked croissants on the table.

James was already there, hiding behind the financial newspaper, with his untouched black coffee in front of him. He didn’t even raise his eyes when I sat down.

“Laura, darling, you need to eat more,” Catherine Reynolds said, pushing a plate of eggs benedict towards me. “You’re too thin. What will people think? That you’re sick.”

“That she doesn’t live up to the Reynolds’ name, as usual,” Margaret, James’ sister, entered the room, her heels tapping on the marble floor. “Good morning, little brother.”

James finally put down the paper to smile at his sister. It was the first genuine smile I’d seen him give since the wedding.

“The coffee’s cold,” he said dryly to the housekeeper, ignoring my presence. “Bring another.”

“So, Laura,” Margaret leaned over the table, her eyes twinkling with mischief, “have you got used to your new position yet? It must be quite an adjustment, considering your origins.”

Before I could reply, James intervened.

“Laura knows exactly where you stand in this house, don’t you, dear?”

The tone of his voice made my stomach turn. I nodded silently, staring at the untouched cup of tea in front of me.

“Oh, I almost forgot.” Mrs. Catherine pulled a gold envelope from her purse. “Charity ball on Friday. Laura, dear, I’ll send my personal seamstress over this afternoon. We need to make sure you’re…presentable.”

“That won’t be necessary,” James folded the newspaper methodically. “Laura has other commitments.”

“But son…”

“I said no.” He stood, straightening his jacket. “Excuse me, I have an important meeting.”

When he left, the silence hung over the table like a toxic cloud. I could feel the two women’s eyes assessing me, judging me, as the croissants cooled, untouched, like my appetite for the life that was now mine.

“The driver is waiting, James,” Mrs. Reynolds said softly.

“I don’t need a driver, Mom. Laura will drive me,” James declared, making everyone at the table freeze.

“Me?” I asked, surprised at the first time he had given me a direct task.

“Yes. Since you insist on working, you can start by being useful. Be my personal chauffeur,” he smiled coldly. “After all, I can’t have my wife working at some random bookstore, but driving for me… that’s acceptable, don’t you think?”

Margaret let out a mocking laugh as I felt my face heat up.

“James, dear, are you sure?” her mother asked, clearly uncomfortable.

“Absolutely.” He tossed the Audi keys in my direction. “Don’t keep me waiting, Laura.”

On shaky legs, I stood up from the table. Mrs. Reynolds sighed heavily.

“Laura,” she called as I stood at the door. “Remember: you’re a Reynolds now. Even if… well, even under the current circumstances.”

In the hallway, James was waiting for me with an expression of pure disdain.

“Rule number one: don’t talk to me during the ride. Rule number two: keep an appropriate distance from other drivers. And rule number three,” he leaned closer, his expensive cologne invading my senses, “don’t you dare think of this as an opportunity to bond. It’s a punishment.”

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered.

“Because I can,” he replied simply. “And because I want you to understand exactly where you belong in this family.”

The sound of our footsteps echoed down the marble hallway, each click of my heels reminding me that this was just another of the many humiliations to come.

“You have twenty minutes.”

The Audi’s plush interior was a stark contrast to the ice that had settled between us. I kept my eyes fixed on the road, remembering the first rule: no talking during the ride. Each red light seemed to last forever.

James sighed in irritation every time I slowed down, but I remained silent. The sound of his fingers on his cell phone was the only soundtrack to that tense morning.

“Incompetent,” he muttered as I stopped at yet another traffic light.

I bit my lip to keep from answering. His rules echoed in my mind: don’t talk, don’t come near, keep your distance.

I watched him in the rearview mirror of the car.

James Reynolds was the kind of man who made women sigh when he walked into a room. Tall, almost 6’3"", his broad shoulders perfectly filled out his tailored Italian suits. His black hair, always smoothed with gel, highlighted his aristocratic features - defined jaw, straight nose, thick eyebrows that shaded sapphire-blue eyes. But they were cold, calculating eyes that never smiled, even when his well-shaped lips curved into a social smile.

When we finally pulled up in front of the imposing Reynolds Enterprises building, James got out of the car and slammed the door shut, his perfectly tailored Italian suit a stark contrast to his stormy expression.

I let my tense muscles relax for a brief moment, but then I noticed the black leather briefcase was still in the backseat.

“James,” I called softly through the window, but he had already disappeared through the revolving doors.

I looked at the briefcase, my heart racing. There were important documents in there, I knew. Documents he would need for the meeting.

Rule number one echoed in my mind again: no talking during the ride.

But the ride was over, and I didn’t have his phone number. I didn’t have my husband’s phone number. Undecided, I stared at the briefcase for no more than a few seconds.

I glanced at myself in the rearview mirror to check my appearance, which needed to be perfect. My shoulder-length blonde hair and light makeup were presentable.

I headed toward the reception to hand it over.

Distracted by my anxiety, I didn’t notice the unevenness on the floor. When I realized it, I had already tripped, feeling a sharp pain in my knee. A slight cut, but enough to make the blood run.

“Damn,” I muttered.

I stood up with a nervous urge, heading quickly to the building’s reception area. My hurried footsteps echoed throughout the room.

“Where is James Reynolds’ office?”

“Who wants it?” the receptionist asked with an inquisitive look, shaking my resolve.

I hesitated for a brief moment before answering.

“I’m Laura, his wife.”

The words came out like venom, each syllable imbued with a resentment I could barely contain.

“Penthouse. Use the private elevator,” she replied without hesitation.

The elevator doors opened to reveal a large reception area with a glass wall. Through the reflection, I saw James, absorbed in a phone call, sitting majestically behind his desk.

“How can someone so handsome be so cruel?” I muttered to myself.

I felt a chill run down my spine when our eyes met - his, as cold as a steel blade.

“What do you think you’re doing?” he questioned, approaching me irritably.

“You forgot something in the car. I don’t have your phone number to let you know,” I replied, trying to remain calm.

For a few seconds, his gaze examined me thoroughly, until he came across my bleeding knee.

One of his secretaries appeared in the doorway, she was dressed in an outfit that was too sexy for a simple secretary.

“Sir, meeting in a minute,” she announced, and her eyes rested on me for a moment.

“Let them wait,” he said, with an indifferent tone that left no room for debate.

His eyes looked at me again, intense. “Come to my office.”

I hesitated, torn between the instinct to retreat and the curiosity his words had aroused.

“Are you just going to stand there?”

The impatience in his voice made me react, and I quickened my pace to follow him.

When I reached the living room, he stared at me with a mixture of suspicion and authority.

“How did you get hurt?” he asked, but his tone was more of a demand than any sign of concern.

“It was just a fall. Nothing serious,” I mumbled, looking away.

“Sit down.”

Without waiting for an answer, he left the room. Before I could decide whether to obey, he returned, carrying antiseptic and a pack of Band-Aids. He placed the items on the table between us with a direct gesture.

“Take care of it,” he ordered, his voice thick with authority.

“It’s nothing,” I insisted, in the same hushed tone as before.

“I didn’t ask if it was,” he replied, his eyes fixed on mine. “How many times do I have to repeat myself?” he said, his tone sharp. “You’re a Reynolds now. You can’t go around looking like that, slovenly. This isn’t about you, it’s about my family’s reputation.”

Those words fell like a stone to my stomach. For a foolish moment, I even believed there was some trace of genuine concern in his attitude.

It was just pride, nothing more.

Before I could react, he grabbed my phone, his movements quick and precise. Without asking for permission, he typed something and handed it back to me.

“You now have my number,” he declared, cold as ever. “Call only in cases of life or death.”

I swallowed hard, fighting the urge to say something that would only make the situation worse. I simply closed my hand around the phone, a silent reminder of who was in control.

Chapter 3: Eva

My stepmother called me saying she needed to speak to me urgently. Her only pressing matters were money or Molly, my stepsister.

When I entered the coffee shop, I saw her sitting at the back table. She was impeccably dressed in a navy blue dress that highlighted her elegant figure. The smile on her lips was refined and discreet.

“Laura, my dear, you look great. Marriage really does work miracles, doesn’t it?”

Eva began, with that honeyed tone that I recognized as the prelude to something disturbing.

“Eva. Why did you ask me to come here, to this place far from home?”

Eva raised her eyebrows, feigning surprise.

“I wanted to talk to you away from your father. You know he has a weak heart.”

“I don’t have much time.”

“But okay, I’ll get straight to the point. I’m in a delicate situation, my dear. Some unexpected bills, an investment opportunity I can’t miss… You understand, don’t you? After all, who doesn’t want a better future?”

I narrowed my eyes. “And what’s that to me?”

Eva smiled, leaning forward.

“You’re married to a powerful and financially comfortable man. I thought it might be a good time to show him that you can contribute to the family business, too. Perhaps a discreet request for money to help with my situation?”

I felt my stomach churn. “You want me to ask James for money? Is that it?”

“Exactly! He would never say no to you if he knew how to ask. We women have our tricks.”

Eva gave a wicked smile. “And speaking of which, dear, you should think about getting pregnant soon. Nothing binds a man more than an heir. And honestly, he’s over thirty.”

My face burned with anger and humiliation. “You must know that well.”

“Oh, but it is, dear. I’m only thinking about your well-being.”

Eva paused, watching my reaction. Then, with a darker expression, she added. “And I know things between you and James aren’t exactly perfect. Or should I say... I know you slept in the guest room on your wedding night.”

I felt the ground shift beneath my feet. “How do you know that?”

Eva gave me a victorious smile.

“I have my ways. Don’t think you can fool me, Laura. James is no fool, and you should take advantage of the position you have while you can. If you keep this up, you’ll end up like your mother: alone and with nothing.”

The mention of my mother was the breaking point. I stood up suddenly, the chair scraping against the floor with a sharp sound.

“If you think you can manipulate me like you manipulated my father, you’re very wrong. You’ve spent all the inheritance my mother left me on trips and a luxurious life for Molly. I’m not going to ask him for anything.”

Eva didn’t lose her poise, but the glint in her eyes betrayed her frustration.

“You’re more naïve than I thought, Laura,” Eva said, her eyes shining with restrained contempt.

I felt my anger rising.

“If you wanted to get your hands on the Reynolds fortune so badly, why didn’t you force Molly to marry him? She could definitely manipulate him much better than I could.”

A cruel smile crossed her painted lips.

“Of course I wanted Molly to marry him, not you. But who would have thought that girl would run away just the day before the wedding?”

“Has she heard anything?” I asked, feeling a mix of concern and curiosity.

“She’s in Paris,” Eva replied, as if she were talking about something as trivial as the weather.

My voice was thick with disbelief. “Is the money for her? I married her instead of avoiding a scandal! Unbelievable.”",1,1753182266.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

Aria's POV

I stood in front of the chapel.

Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner I saw—my favorite flowers. The guests were already seated in their designer dresses and pressed suits. And soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.

Everything was perfect.

Except I wasn't the bride.

""I really need to see Jace today.""

I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet—everything I owned in the world.

""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.

I saw it in his eyes—disgust. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.

But I have my reason.

""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.

Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.

Today he was marrying Delilah Hart.

Sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.

All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would make their wealth skyrocket, including Jace.

So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.

So it’s normal why he didn’t want any guests to see me here.

I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glossy, glittering new world.

Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.

“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.”

""Wait here.""

The bodyguard finally made a call. A few minutes later, he waved me in.

I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.

Instantly, I felt how out of place I was.

Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more. And me? I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.

""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.

I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut. But poverty had a scent, apparently.

""Mr. Carter is inside. Make it quick."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned.

“Thank you.”

The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. Floor-length mirrors. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment. I hesitated for a second as I dragged my dirty luggage across the white carpet.

And there he was.

The man I used to love. Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.

He was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him. When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.

""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly. And immediately wanted to punch myself.

Hey, Jace? That’s the best I could do?

His face was ice cold.

""You shouldn't come. Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""

Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.

""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.

He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want, Aria?""

Wow.

I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard. I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.

""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how cold and empty you are. You’ll lose it all.""

Anger flared across his face.

""I know how to love. I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""

“No.”

I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.

""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""

Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.

From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor. Our relationship was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married—and I was out of a job. He fired me.

""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got it because of me. Now that I’m not around, they finally saw how incompetent you are. Problem?""

Was he fucking kidding me?!

""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I cried.

“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”

He walked closer, smirking.

""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I made those calls. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""

He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.

""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""

I was throwing my pride at his feet.

But he laughed.

""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.

He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.

""You never let me touch you. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you a check you can’t refuse. How does that sound?""

I widened my eyes in shock.

Then I slapped him. HARD.

“WHAT THE FUCK! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his face.

""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""

Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.

Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.

God this couldn’t be any worse.

I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life because I needed the job and money. But I still let him get to me.

Now what do I do?

My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.

So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that—

""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.

Too late.

I slammed right into the man in front of me. He was tall—so tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.

His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade, and when we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.

In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.

“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.

The man in front of me was so handsome. Like a statue carved by a master artist. Yet his expression so cold. He looked down at me, and I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.

And then I recognized who he was.

This was Jace’s son-to-be brother-in-law. Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.

THE legendary. Grayson Hart.

“Aria Collins?”

His voice was sexy and velvety.

He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.

Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.

But wait.

How did he know my name?

# Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV

Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?

I’d met him at an Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.

But there was no way he’d know who I was.

“I-I… Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.

He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.

“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?”

He paused—just for a second—then flicked a piece of paper down at my feet.

I looked down. A blank check.

“I need a shirt I can actually wear out of here. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.

But he didn’t even glance back as he walked away.

“God,” I muttered under my breath.

Can you believe these rich bastards? They think they can buy everything with money.

People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.

“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”

Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.

Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.

“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.”

I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace. They adored him—spent more time flirting with at the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing their share of the workload.

After I got fired—and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out—they decided I was public enemy number one.

“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.

“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.

But they blocked me.

“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”

They burst into laughter together.

“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”

I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least I’ve actually been with Jace. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume? Apparently he rather be with a poor-ass small-town girl than any of you.”

Their jaws dropped.

“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.

“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”

They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.

Rich people were assholes.

Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.

I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.

I had no idea where to go.

I could crash in the hospital with my grandma for a night, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her knowing how bad things had gotten.

I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.

So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.

She texted back right away inviting me to come over.

Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.

Then I heard them.

“Hey, nice shirt!”

A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.

I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.

“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”

Go away. Go away. Go away.

“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.

“Get away from me!” I snapped, my voice shaking.

But it only fired them up.

“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”

They grabbed my wrists, yanked my arms down. My T-shirt gaped open completely, revealing my lace bra. The cold air made my skin pebble. They laughed even louder.

I struggled and screamed. My wolf growled in rage. Shifting in the city was illegal—but right now, I didn’t have a second choice—

Just then. Blinding headlights. Followed by screeching tires.

A black car skidded to a stop inches away.

The door flew open. A deep voice thundered, “Get in.”

I was too shocked that I didn’t think twice and obeyed. The car peeled away the second I shut the door.

“My suitcase!” I cried.

“Someone will get it,” he said darkly. “Address.”

I told the driver May’s. Then he pressed a button. A privacy screen slid up between the front and back seats, sealing us in the back.

That’s when he turned toward me and leaned in. Like a beast ready to pounce. His scent hit me like a punch—sharp pine mixed with cold metal.

My head started to get dizzy.

“Walking on the street in that shirt was a mistake,” he said sternly.

“It got like this because of you,” I mumbled.

He snorted. Then the sound of rustling fabric. A heavy jacket landed across my shoulders—it was still warm from his body and carried his scent.

I held my breathe. Wearing his coat almost felt like…he was wrapping himself around me.

“You—do you know me?” I whispered.

My gut told me that he would never do this for a strange girl. But if he knew who I was, he must know that I was his sister’s husband’s ex. That didn’t explain why he would help.

“We’ve met,” he said simply.

I stared at him, searching those icy gray eyes. He was staring at me too, with that cold, hungry, possessive eyes. I felt like I was completely naked in front of him.

“Aria,” he warned, voice thick and husky.

But I couldn’t control myself.

I was leaning forward.

Shit. Why did my body become so weird?

My skin was on fire. My panties were wet. All I wanted was more of his scent, more of his heat.

The next second his lips were crashed onto mine—Hard. Rough.

I gasped and opened my mouth for him. His tongue slipped in and explored every inch of my mouth, making me shiver. His hands pushed into my torn shirt and grabbed my waist. I couldn’t control my moan when he touched my naked skin.

This was crazy! He was a stranger, and most importantly, my ex’s soon-to-be brother-in-law. And I was making out with him at the back of his car.

The crazy part was I didn’t even want to stop.

He lifted me onto his lap like I weighed nothing. I straddled his thighs and yanked at his tie as he bite my collarbone.

Then, suddenly, the car stopped.

“Alpha, we’ve arrived.”

That’s when it all froze. His lips paused at my neck. I was still squirming on his lap, flushed and throbbing. But he shoved me off.

“We can’t do this,” he said coldly.

# Chapter 3 You're Special To Him

Aria’s POV

“So you’re telling me this guy made out with you in the backseat of his car… and then just shoved you off like nothing happened?” May asked in shock.

20 minutes later, I was sitting at her place, wrapped in one of her oversized hoodies, a steaming mug of tea in my hands.

But I was still reeling from everything that had just happened.

“Yup,” I muttered. “Who knows what’s wrong with him.”

“What an asshole,” she huffed. “But honestly, this really isn’t like you. You dated that jerk Jace for 4 years and didn’t even sleep with him—which, by the way, was a brilliant choice—and now you're suddenly making out with a complete stranger in his car?”

I opened my mouth but had no idea what to say. Yeah, she had a point.

“I—I don’t know. Maybe it was the whole Jace-getting-married thing. Maybe I just snapped and wanted to screw around with someone hotter just to get back at him…Honestly, it was so stupid now that I think of it.”

She grinned and wiggled her brows. “So… he was hot huh?”

My cheeks flushed and my mind drifted back.

Those stormy gray eyes, his perfectly shaped lips on my neck, and those arms that could pick me up like I weighed nothing…Shit I need to stop.

“Yeah. VERY,” I whispered, hiding my red face behind the mug.

May burst out laughing. “Now we’re talking! That’s exactly what you need right now—a drop-dead gorgeous rebound to get that loser Jace out of your system. Screw your ‘no sex before marriage’ rule. Life is short.”

I gave her a weak smile.

Honestly, I didn’t need a rebound. I needed a job, money, and a place to live. Grayson Hart was like dessert when you can’t even afford dinner.

“So… do you even know who this guy was?” she asked.

I hesitated. Right at this moment, the doorbell rang.

She jumped up to get it and came back a few minutes later, hauling in my luggage, her face frozen in disbelief.

“OMG. You are not gonna believe what just showed up outside.”

“Umm… my luggage?” I joked.

“Two fucking muscular guys in black suits and guns! And a freaking stretch limo! They called me ‘ma’am’ and said they hope Miss Aria has a wonderful evening. Now, you—”

She leapt at me and shook me by the shoulders.

“—you tell me right now who the hell you hooked up with!”

I squealed and dropped into the couch with her, laughing and giggling breathlessly.

“Okay, okay—I’ll tell you. It was… Grayson Hart.”

I practically whispered his name.

Because honestly, I still couldn’t believe it either.

May froze, eyes wide as saucers. “Grayson—THE Grayson Hart?! As in our Alpha? The CEO of Apex?!”

“And Jace’s soon-to-be brother-in-law. Now you know how stupid I was earlier?”

She let out a full-on scream. Then she grabbed my hand, her face flushed with excitement. “Oh my God! Aria, do you know what this means? Alpha Grayson never even lends his jacket to his model girlfriends. He likes you. You’re special!”

“No,” I said firmly. “If I was special, he wouldn’t have thrown me off his lap when I tried to take off his shirt.”

“Maybe he had somewhere to be—”

“Don’t, May. Let’s be real. Guys like him don’t fall for girls like me.” I took another sip of tea, hiding the ache in my chest.

Hell even Jace thought I was beneath him.

What chance did I have with Grayson freaking Hart?

“Don’t be silly, Aria. You’re gorgeous. And smart and amazing and—WAIT! I just had the best idea ever.”

“What?”

“That arrogant jerk Jace thinks you’re just some small-town prude who wasn’t good enough for him right? But what if you ended up with Alpha Grayson? It’ll be easy to get him because he’s already obsessed. Oh, it would destroy Jace. That dickhead would never recover.”

OKAY.

I’d be lying if I said that exact scenario hadn’t crossed my mind when Grayson kissed me back.

What girl hasn’t daydreamed about dating the perfect guy and getting revenge in the most dramatic way possible?

But right now, I couldn’t afford to daydream. Reality was already breathing down my neck.

“Tempting. But right now I need a job and enough cash to keep Grandma in her hospital bed. Dating rich dudes isn’t exactly high on my to-do list.”

May looked at me with soft eyes. “So…any plans? I can try to hook you up with a job, but you know I just work at a coffee shop, and with your degree, you deserve so much more.”

I hugged her. “Thank you. Really. I’ll figure something out. Apex promised me severance when they fired me, so I’m going to HR tomorrow to get it sorted.”

If I could get that money, at least I’d be OK for the next round of Grandma’s medical bills.

—

The next morning, I showed up at Apex right on time.

But the second Brielle walked in with the HR manager, I had a bad feeling.

“What’s she doing here?” I asked coldly.

“I’ll explain in a minute,” HR replied with a polite, rehearsed smile as she sat across from me. “So Ms. Collins, I understand you’re here to discuss severance?”

“Yes. So let’s not waste time. Just give me the check and I’ll be out of here.”

“Unfortunately, severance only applies when the company terminates a contract without cause. In your case… it appears you were let go due to misconduct.”

Misconduct?

What the freaking hell.

“Jace made a snap decision and booted me. What misconduct are you talking about?”

“But that’s not what Mr. Carter said. He provided evidence that you made a costly error on a sales quote—omitting a few zeroes, to be exact. Cost the company millions. Here’s the email record.”

She handed me a printed sheet.

I swore I had never sent this email in my life. But there it was—my name in the sender field.

No freaking way.

Jace forged this.

“And Mr. Carter reported that you had a difficult attitude toward your coworkers. Quote: ‘impatient and arrogant.’ Brielle’s here to verify that.”

Brielle twirled her hair and smiled smugly. “Yeah. Aria was a horrible team player.”

I stood so fast my chair screeched. “The only thing I didn’t ‘teamplayed’ with you was flirt with the boss in the breakroom!”

“Liar!” she yelled. “And I asked Jace. He never said my voice was screechy!”

Oh my God. I couldn’t believe how stupid she was.

“Sit down, Miss Collins,” HR warned. “As of now, not only are you not getting severance, but we’re also considering legal action to recover the losses. If you understand the situation here, sign this acknowledgement—”

“Does Alpha Grayson know about this?” I asked.

Both of them froze. After a long pause, HR finally found her voice. “What does Alpha Grayson have to do with any of this?”

“He owns Apex, doesn’t he? Does he know his team is abusing their power and firing hardworking employees illegally?”

HR frowned. Brielle let out a loud snort. “Please. Don’t act like you know Alpha Grayson.”

“What if I do? What if I go to him and then it’s you who gets fired?”

She laughed in my face. “Oh, you mean you know him on TV?”

“Let’s find out.”

I shoved my chair back and stormed out, heading straight for the CEO’s private elevator at the end of the hall. HR scrambled after me, shouting my name.

I was too furious to care how this ended. All I wanted now was to blow the whole damn place up.

Two guards stood by the elevator.

“I need to see Alpha Grayson,” I told them.

“Appointment?”

“No, but I swear he knows me. Just tell him it’s Aria—from yesterday. He’ll remember.”

“You aren’t the first girl here saying that,” one of them mocked.

“Come on, Miss Collins,” HR snapped, trying to drag me back. “This is getting crazy. Go back, sign the paper. Take responsibility for your own mistake.”

“I didn’t send that email. It was Jace—he’s framing me! I will report all of you.”

“Alpha Grayson doesn’t have time for your report, or your visit, or any of your little drama!”

“I believe no one but me has the right to decide that,” a cold voice said behind us.

# Chapter 4 Take Me, Please

Aria’s POV

A large hand grabbed my arm and pulled me away from HR’s grip.

I looked up and my heart almost stopped.

Even I couldn’t believe he just showed up here. It felt like a dream.

“A-Alpha Grayson,” HR stammered, her face frozen with shock and fear.

“I don’t need employees who think they can make decisions for their boss,” he said freezingly while wrapping his arm around my waist. “If I see something like this again, you’re fired.”

“Y-yes, Alpha. I’m terribly sorry…”

HR’s expression was priceless, but I was in no mood to enjoy it. His icy pine scent consumed me again, making my body weak and hot. My wolf let out a soft purr, urging me to lean into him. But before I could even move, he let go.

A pang of disappointment hit me in the chest.

“Come,” he said shortly, striding toward the private elevator.

I shot HR and the stunned security guards a smug look, then hurried after him.

He swiped his card and the elevator doors closed. We started going up to the 58th floor.

It was dead silent. My heart was beating so wildly that I was afraid he’d hear it. I snuck a glance at him—he just stared straight ahead, emotionless, keeping a distance, like he wanted to be anywhere but here.

Unease twisted my stomach.

“So, um… what brings you here today?” I broke the silence.

He sighed softly. “I owe this company.”

“Oh, Oh…Right.”

I wanted to punch myself in the face.

The awkward silence lingered until the elevator dinged open. The 58th floor was a wide-open space with no cubicles or dividers—just massive floor-to-ceiling windows and a sweeping view of the entire city.

“Wow,” I whispered under my breath. Grayson was already walking ahead.

I jogged to catch up as he led me into an office at the far end of the floor. A stunning female assistant closed the door behind us, and once again, it was just the two of us. My heart rocketed back into my throat.

He casually unbuttoned his jacket. It was amazing how he made even that look sexy.

“So you insisted on seeing me?” he asked.

He didn’t ask me to sit. He didn’t even move closer. That distance stung a little.

“I worked here till a week ago when I found out I was let go for no reason…” I quickly told him the story of how I was fired. “This is clearly illegal in so many ways… can you help me get my job back?”

“Unfortunately, no,” he replied, barely hesitating.

My heart dropped like a stone. “Why not?”

“I’ll have the hiring department look into whether your termination followed proper protocol. But this isn’t something a CEO handles directly. Anything else?”

The hiring department?

That could take weeks—and I didn’t have weeks.

“No… you don’t get it,” I stepped forward, my voice trembling. “My grandma’s in the hospital. Her bills are getting insane every month. And I’m already deep in debt… If I can’t make money, I don’t even know— I really, REALLY need this job.”

I knew we came from two different worlds, but laying out the most desperate parts of my life in front of him still made me feel horribly exposed. I just hoped—begged—that he’d understand.

But he didn’t.

His gray eyes stayed emotionless.

“I’m sorry, Miss Collins,” he said quietly.

Tears rushed into my eyes. I couldn’t even breathe.

All I could think about were the bills, the debt, the mountain of shit waiting for me the second I left this building.

“If there’s nothing else, my assistant will show you out.” he said, reaching for the intercom.

I rushed forward and pressed my hand down on his before he could call anyone in.

His whole body stiffened—but he didn’t pull away. He just stared down at me. I stepped in closer, tilting my head up. His gray eyes darkened like a storm brewing in the distance.

His pine scent wrapped around me again, thick and intoxicating. As werewolves, our scent only spikes during a fight or sexual arousal. It was damn obvious which case this was.

“You clearly feel something for me,” I whispered.

He said nothing. I placed my hand on his chest and felt his heartbeat. It was racing as well. His breathing had also turned shallow.

“What are you doing, Miss Collins?” he asked tightly. “Trying to seduce your way into a job?”

“You can do whatever you want,” I locked eyes with him. “I won’t stop you.”

His Adam’s apple bobbed. God, I wanted to lick it.

And… well, I did.

I leaned up and pressed my lips to it. He let out a growl.

The next second, I was pinned on his desk. He stood between my spread legs, one hand by my head. I whimpered, clamping my thighs together—the heat between them was almost unbearable. Just like in the backseat of his car.

His hand slid from the desk to my throat. It was so big, he could probably snap my neck if he wanted.

Since then, I’ve gotten completely addicted to it, and I think I’ve dialed in what, for me, is a damn good cup. 

A couple of interesting conclusions to note before I share my recipe. First, I’ve found that grinding coarser than you normally would is essential. I’m talking in the French Press range. I use a Kingrinder P1, which recommends 30-40 clicks for AeroPress. I set mine at 65 and it’s just right for this method. Don’t be scared to go coarse, it’s key. Second, cooler temps are better. We’re going for a long, gentle process here, so dial it back some from the normal temps. I go with 88° C for a light medium roast and it’s just right. That said, here’s the recipe I’m currently in love with:

16 g of a light-medium roast. Something a bit nutty really shines here. 65 clicks on Kingrinder P1. Water temp at 88° C. I’m using a standard size AeroPress Clear.

Set up for the inverted method with the plunger just below the circle around the “4” mark. Use the standard cap and paper filter, and pre-dampen the filter. Add your coffee to the AeroPress. 

Set your timer at 14 min. Start the timer and add 65 g of water. Stir gently for even saturation but not enough to break up the cake. Allow to bloom until the timer hits 13 min.

Add water up to 225 g and install the cap. Do not press out the air. With two min remaining, flip the AeroPress onto your mug, and swirl it a bit to get all the coffee off the plunger, and to get the coffee to sink. When the timer goes off, very slowly press the coffee, we’re talking 50 seconds to a minute. Press through the hiss. With such a coarse grind, we don’t have to worry about fines coming through, so don’t be afraid to press firmly at the end. 

Lastly, add 50 g of room temperature water to the mug, stir gently to integrate, and enjoy. 

I find this method, while obviously a longer process, produces such an explosively flavorful cup that it’s very difficult for me to defer to the typical brew times of 2-3 min. Please experiment with tweaking the different elements and leave your notes in the comments. I’d love to hear about your experiences and feedback. Have a great day!",7,1753182091.0,AeroPress,1,0.9,False

literieChapter 1

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

“No, it’s not–”

“How dare you?” Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. “Throw her in the dungeons!” he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn’t even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons—a dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”

# Chapter 3

Auren POV

As Reya dragged me out of the dungeons, my heart drummed against my ribcage out of pure fear. I couldn’t even think of marrying Alpha Lucien, not just because he was cursed, but also because Alpha Bram was my mate. The idea was abhorrent. It was better to die than to marry Alpha Lucien.

Summoning up whatever little energy I had left in me, I pulled my hand out of Reya’s and thought of running towards the forest that surrounded our pack. Once I got away from here, I was sure I would find help.

But the truth was cruel. I stood up, and the next second, my legs felt weak and my body collapsed. With a loud “bump”, I fell to the ground, so did my hope. The dust stung my lungs, my tears welling up in an instant. “No–” I struggled.

“Ha, you think you can escape?” Reya caught my neck with great force, turning my face to her. I couldn’t see her face clearly, but I assumed an evil smile there. “Get her.” She ordered before throwing me to the ground.

Two warriors jumped right in front of me. My eyes widened in horror. “Please leave me alone!” I begged them. “Let me live.”

As if my words irritated her, Reya came into my line of vision again. She directly charged at me and tackled me to the ground. She punched my side and I heard a crack. It meant that one of my ribs had fractured. A scream ripped out of my throat as my body turned numb in pain. “Live? You are so pathetic. Pick her up!” she ordered the warriors. One of them hauled me over his shoulder with no mercy to my fractured rib. As I screamed and cried and begged them to leave me, they carried me all the way to a little room in the omegas’ quarters and slammed the door shut behind them.

I pounded on the door, shouting, coughing blood. “Please leave me. Please.” But no one listened. Eventually, I slipped down on the floor with blood-stained clothes.

I don’t know how many hours went by when I heard the door creak open. I lifted my head only to see the pack's healer. “Luna Maris has sent me to you. Drink this draft,” he ordered. “It will reduce your pain.”

“C—can I talk to her?” I asked.

He clenched his jaw and without replying to me, forced me to have the draft and left, locking the door behind him.

I felt so weak and helpless that I sat against the wall as fresh tears sprang from my eyes. “This is not justified, goddess,” I said aloud. “It is not my fault that you bestowed Alpha Bram as my mate.” Alpha Lucien was the most ruthless Alpha in the north. “What have you written for me in this life?”

The door opened again and this time Alpha Bram walked in. He narrowed his eyes at me and scrunched his face. Shaking his head, he said, “How could the moon goddess bestow you as my mate? There must have been some mistake. You are so pathetic!”

With my eyes wide open, I stared at him with rage simmering in my chest. Feeling horrible under his gaze, I retorted, “I am not pathetic. You are pathetic! You are rejecting your moon-mate.”

He let out a growl and in a flash of a second, he grabbed my throat with his large hands. “Auren!” he shouted. “How dare you say that to your Alpha? You had the guts to run away and defy my orders.”

I started sputtering and coughing as he squeezed my airway.

“Bram!” Maris entered the room and shouted at him. “Don’t do that. Tomorrow she is going forever!”

Alpha Bram shoved me away and got up, still growling. And then came out the poisoned words,

“I, Alpha Bram Reed of the Crimson Howl Pack, reject you, Auren Cressida as my mate.”

“Noooo!” I shrieked as sharp pain stabbed my stomach and heart. My vision blurred and I doubled over, unable to move. Through my blurry vision, I saw Alpha Bram and Maris glaring at me coldly. Maris smirked and holding his hand, she walked out of the room, locking the door behind me.

“I will send Reya to dress her up tomorrow,” I heard her voice before I fainted.

When I woke up next, I felt numbness in my body. Seina had howled and whimpered all night and eventually rolled up in a ball and tucked away somewhere, where I couldn’t reach her. She was more hurt than I was.

Morning light was filtering in my room. It was a morning of doom. I didn’t have the strength to get up and do anything. I had lost my appetite. When the door opened again, I saw Reya entering with a box in her hand, followed by a maid.

She chuckled. “What a wretched bitch!” She pulled me up roughly. “Luna Maris has sent me to dress you up. But first you need a bath. You stink like a rotten critter.”

She dragged me to the bathroom where she opened a cold water shower. I shivered under it uncontrollably, but she was least bothered. When I came out, she threw a dress at me. “Wear this. Alpha Lucien will be here in an hour.”

I gaped at her with horror. Alpha Lucien was coming so fast?

The dress loosely hung over my shoulders. From the smell of it, I knew it was Maris’s old one.

Reya’s face lit up with a shrewd grin. “Congratulations, Auren. You are getting married to the most unwanted Alpha in the north. Consider yourself lucky that you will live another year while serving as his breeder.”

Chills ran down my body at the way she said it to me, and my knees felt wobbly. I walked shakily behind her until I reached the main hall.

The place was buzzing with activity. All the omegas were preparing for Alpha Lucien’s arrival. Maris was giving orders to them and as soon as she saw me, she sniggered. She jerked her chin to Reya who nodded and took me to a corner of the room. My eyes went to Alpha Bram who was talking to some people. Why was it that the rejection affected me and not him? Did his wolf not feel the pain? Tears came into my eyes again, but this time I refused to let them out because I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me broken and shattered.

A few minutes later, he went out and when he returned, he was with Alpha Lucien. The most terrifyingly beautiful wolf I’d ever seen.

Towering at over six feet, his broad shoulders and chiseled physique radiated raw power. Midnight-black hair framed a cold, sharp, angular face, with dark eyes that seemed to pierce your soul. There were tattoos of vines and thorns on his muscular arms. His presence was magnetic yet menacing, like that of a silent, dangerous predator cloaked in charm.

No fight, no chaos, just a cold, detached exit.

It’s been a brutal week of grief and anger, but what’s hitting me the hardest is the realisation of how *much pain* his avoidant behaviour had been causing me for years.

I used to be such a securely attached person - confident in myself, grounded in my relationships, feeling worthy. But with him, I was constantly trying to *figure him out -* to decode his silences (oh, the eggshells!) to soothe his discomfort when things got vulnerable, to shrink my needs so I wouldn’t push him away. Over time, it chipped away at my self-esteem in ways I couldn’t see while I was in it.   
  
He saw me (and labeled me) as an ""anxiously attached"" girl.  
He gaslit me into feeling like I was “too much,” “too emotional,” “too needy.” I bent over backwards defending his poor behaviour because I loved him so deeply and didn’t want to see him as the selfish, emotionally stunted person he really was.   
  
I was so kind, compassionate and understanding towards him. Too much, in hindsight! I genuinely still battle with this misplaced empathy that almost feels *wrong.* His complex and complicated childhood, his reluctance to process things, his ability to just switch off.   
  
A recent neurodivergent diagnosis confirmed a lot of my suspicions.   
Adding PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance / Persistent Drive for Autonomy).   
Has anyone else been treading water in this sinking boat? Being the partner in this particular dynamic can be exhausting. And then you add: ""so, *thaaaat's*  why"" type of reasoning to it. And you think: ""*he can't help it*"" to just further support **his needs** again.

And now? Well, he gets to butterfly onto the next shiny distraction while I’m here cleaning up the mess he left behind. It's infuriating!   
I’m the one stuck caring for the dog (which was as much his responsibility as mine), sorting out the lease, and now, it seems: *having* to chase him for his share of the bills because he’s gone completely silent.

I’m livid. I'm heartbroken. I'm disgusted with how much of myself I gave away to protect him from accountability. I supported him through a 3-year university degree: financially, emotionally, and in every way a loving partner should especially when his dysfunctional family was NOWHERE to be found.   
I picked up the slack when he was overwhelmed, cheered him on when he doubted himself and held our shared life together so he could focus.   
And when it was finally meant to be *my* time, when he promised to ""support me""... when I could take a breath, lean on him a little and start building the next chapter for *us:* he bounced. Just like that.

**But** therapy is helping. And it’s been such a relief for my nervous system to start feeling how peaceful life is without constantly managing someone else’s emotions. I thought that this is what a real partnership was, perhaps I still do.   
  
Reading others’ experiences in this sub has also been so incredibly validating. I’m not alone in this disappointment and that’s also helping me rebuild piece by piece.

I can’t believe how much calmer I feel, even in my heartbreak. It makes me sad for the version of me that tolerated so much confusion and self-abandonment to keep him comfortable. Never again.

Whether it's spending time with people, pursuing hobbies, or just relaxing, it all feels out of reach. I'm not sure if this is just part of adjusting to a new routine or something deeper. It might be the mental load of new people, expectations, and structure. Either way, it feels like my day ends before I get to live any of it for myself.

Caffeine, especially coffee, has helped me in the past. I've used it more as a tool than a habit. I never had it regularly enough to form a dependency, but I know it gives me focus and momentum when I need it. That makes me think about reintroducing it, especially in the mornings, to feel more switched on.

The tricky part is that I know myself. When something works, I tend to lean into it more than I should. Even though I understand that moderation matters, I worry I might not keep that balance over time.

So I'm trying to decide whether to wait another month to see if I can naturally adjust and build a better post-work life without caffeine, or just start having coffee in the morning and let it support me through this phase.",1,1753181586.0,getdisciplined,1,0.67,False

Anyway …


I didn’t expect to be updating you all this soon, but something happened last night that I’d be stupid not to share.

It was supposed to be one of my nights off—and to be honest, I’d just bought a new 56-inch 4K TV thanks to my increasingly bizarre source of income. I was ready to kick back. But I had to come in. I needed to.

Mr. Clinton called around midnight.

“Will! Hi—Mr. Clinton here. Your fantastically amazing boss and, I’d like to assume, friend. We need you to come in. Like, now. To cover the rest of the shift.”

Thing is, I never gave him my number. And my name still wasn’t William.

“Uh, hi Mr. Clinton. It’s my day off, man. Why do you need me so desperately? What happened to the guy doing nights?”

“He’s on the floor—”

I was about to make a smartass remark like, just pick him up then, but he kept going:

“—and the walls. The ceiling. The popcorn maker. Rustling and squelching. And in my pocket.”

“…I mean. What happened?”

At first, I was a little relieved that someone else was having a rough time too—but it sounded like maybe this guy had it slightly worse than me.

“Well, the Grey Lady happened. She seemed harmless enough, but the other guy tried talking to her. Asked her to stop messing with the displays. And then—POOF!—a mist of red, and shit just started flying!”

I wasn’t entirely sure how seriously to take him. His words were absurd—but recent events had done a good job of steamrolling my rational mind. And still, the way he described someone going out like that? It made me feel sick.

I wasn’t going to go in. Not until he said:

“Triple. I’ll give you triple to come in and cover the last six hours. Just over £3.2k.”

Within ten minutes, I was back in uniform and on my way to work.

No way I could turn down a ludicrous amount of money like that. Still, I had the sense the pay was less about generosity—and more about Mr. Clinton knowing exactly what kind of night lay ahead.
I arrived at the cinema, which glowed like a beacon through the misty night.

Something felt off right away. The mist wasn’t its usual dull grey—it was a deep maroon, tinged with the smell of copper. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, but something about it reminded me too much of blood. The thought nagged at me, raising more questions about the events that led to the last guy’s… untimely demise.

Through the haze, I spotted Ash outside, using a leaf blower to clear the red mist from the front doors. Slowly, it began to thin out, dispersing from the building bit by bit.

“Hey man! Go round the back—and try not to breathe too much till you’re in, yeah? Don’t wanna inhale too much of the last guy!”

I immediately shifted from a walk to a brisk jog, covering my face with my sleeve. Once inside, Ash tossed me a few paper towels.

“Welcome back,” they said, with a slight smirk.

I wiped my face, expecting sweat. But when I pulled the towel away, it was stained a sickly pink. I chose not to dwell on it.

“Back again so soon? Gotta admit, I missed you a bit.”
Ash threw their arms around me with a surprising, slightly awkward hug, then chuckled to themselves as they led me into the lobby.

It was surprisingly clean, considering someone had just exploded. But then I noticed the bin.

Poking out from the top was a whole leg—trousers and shoe still attached.

Ash caught my glance and tried to steer me away from it with an exaggerated clap of their hands.

“Okaaaay! So. New rule: if the Grey Lady shows up, just let her do her thing. Don’t try to stop her. Or—well. You know.”

They gestured vaguely toward the leg before walking off to dispose of what was left. My only task? Sit behind the glass counter and wait for customers. Easy enough.

Apparently, we had another late-night premiere, so we got a fairly normal crowd asking for tickets. Some of them were… less normal.

One guy asked for “Tape 7 of 42, Gloucestershire, 1980.”
Another muttered “Open the emergency exit.”

I did exactly as instructed: gave them a ticket to Screen Five and said nothing. Things were going smoothly enough. I was even starting to feel like I was getting the hang of this strange little job.

That was, until the next customer came in.

And as I sit here writing this, I still can’t tell if they were real or a figment of my imagination.
The glass doors flew open with a bang that sounded like a gunshot.

I jumped.

Someone strode toward the counter, arms wide. “Good evening, good evening! It’s so good to be back!” he said, grinning. “You, sir, behind the counter—are you well?”

He couldn’t have been much older than me, but he spoke with the kind of polished elegance you’d expect from an old aristocrat. He wore a black tuxedo that looked like it had been dragged through every hedge on the way here. His skin was pale—too pale—and cracked like porcelain, leaking faint trails of greenish goo.

“Uh… yeah. I’m fine, thanks. What can I help you with? Are you here to see something tonight?”

He smiled wider. “You, of course. I’ve seen a lot of good things from you. Knew you’d fit in perfectly around here. I’ve known you for quite some time now.”

That made no sense. I’d only just met the guy—but he was talking like we were old friends. Or worse—like I was part of something I didn’t remember agreeing to.

He ran a long finger along the glass counter and tapped it softly.

“So,” he said, “how are you finding it here?”

“It’s… unique. And, quite frankly, terrifying. But I’ve got more money than sense, so there’s that.”

“Good lad. I’m glad to hear it. Listen—I can help you, you know. I am the light in this sea of darkness. And you, my boy, are riding a paddleboat straight into the jaws of death. Let me be your lighthouse.”

I can’t lie—I was incredibly confused. But also? A little intrigued.

“Okay… how exactly are you planning to help me?”

“All in good time. All in good time,” he whispered. “We don’t want to let it know what we’re doing, after all.”

That was it. Rational thought slammed back into place. This guy was clearly unhinged.

He bowed theatrically and started to walk away, whistling to himself. But just before he left, he turned back to me, locked eyes, and winked.

Weird. Deeply weird. But I wasn’t harmed physically—or mentally—so I counted it as a win and carried on with my shift.



The next couple of hours were quieter.

The man in the green coat showed up again. Just like last time, he glided straight up to the counter, mumbled in that awful monotone voice.
“Flat 9. Red door. Pemberton Road. No lock. Sooner.”

That was my friend’s flat. She’d only moved in two weeks ago.

I felt cold. Real, bone-deep fear. This thing—whatever it was—knew where my loved ones lived. That terrified me more than anything else that had happened so far.

He didn’t leave right away this time. He just stood there, staring at me, or atleast I could feel a stare from behind . I could feel him pressing against my very soul. My body screamed for fight or flight—but instead, I froze.

My stomach turned over. I felt like something heavy had been dropped on my back, pushing me downward, suffocating me.

Then, suddenly—a hand reached out from beside me and slammed a tub of popcorn down onto the glass. The sound was so sharp I yelped.

Just like that, the pressure lifted. I could breathe again. But before I could turn around, the bucket was dropped onto my head. Popcorn bounced off my shoulders.

“That was a medium you gave him, you fucking idiot.”

I yanked the tub off and saw the man in the tuxedo again, shaking his head and chuckling.

“Christ, if I hadn’t shown up,” he muttered, “you’d be a pile of meat on the floor by now.”

He wandered off into the corridor behind me, still laughing.

The colour drained from my face. My hands shook. My breath came fast and shallow as it hit me—I had almost died. Over a popcorn size mix-up.

I sank onto the nearest stool, head in my hands, trying to collect myself.

I knew the rules. I knew the risks. And still, I’d been careless. I couldn’t afford another mistake.

To keep myself grounded, I threw myself into routine cleaning and maintenance.

Anything to stay busy.
Anything to stay safe.

I began cleaning down one of the side corridors I hadn’t ventured into before—one Ash hadn’t shown me.

At first glance, it looked normal enough. Same décor. Same dim lighting. A mess of popcorn and spilled drinks littered the floor—nothing I hadn’t seen a hundred times before. I figured the morning crew had just forgotten about it.

The corridor wasn’t long. Just four doors. Three of them were cinema screens, but none were numbered. Instead, each door was marked with strange symbols—collages of lines, circles, and angles etched into dark wood like something pulled from an occult geometry textbook.

At the far end stood a single black door, smaller than the others, plain except for a small gold projector symbol mounted just above the handle.

Then it slammed shut.

“Hello? Ash? That you?”

No answer.

I edged closer. The door clicked. It creaked open slightly, inviting me.

If curiosity killed the cat, then I was well on my way to using up a few lives.

I stepped through and found a short staircase leading up. At the top was what looked like an old projection room. Wall to wall, it was lined with reels and tapes. In the center stood a massive, antique projector, quietly whirring away.

Which was strange—because we only used digital systems. This had to be some dusty leftover from a bygone era, kept around for nostalgia’s sake.

But the projector was on, and it was clearly playing something. I moved to the small observation window and peeked down at the screen below.

The cinema room it looked out on was completely empty—save for two figures sitting in the front row.

On screen, instead of a film, there was what looked like a slideshow. A soft, delicate piano played in the background.

The first few images were of a young family in a park, filmed from a distance. The camera was shaky, like someone had filmed it covertly. There were other people in the background, but the footage focused relentlessly on this one group.

Then the scene shifted.

A hospital, maybe. The footage showed only legs from the knees down, as shadows moved in and out of frame. It was clinical, quiet, unnerving.

Then—darkness.

The screen went black, and the piano played a long, low, foreboding note. A faint red glow appeared in the center of the projection, lighting the room with a sinister hue. Then a metal door swung into frame with a loud thunk, and a voice whispered, “Help.”

The reel stopped.

Darkness.

I fumbled for my phone to turn on the torch, but before I could switch it on, the projector began to vibrate.

Its outer shell twisted and cracked.

From within, black, fleshy tendrils began to slide out—stretching and warping, folding into limbs. The metal buckled and reshaped itself, like it was birthing something.

And then it stood.

A grotesque figure, stitched together from reels of film and bits of metal, legs jerking as it moved with unnatural spasms. A light flickered in the center of what might have been its face.

Then came the sound—a flickering screech like static and tearing celluloid all at once.

I ran.

I sprinted to the door and yanked the handle.

Locked.

“Help! Ash?! Someone open this fucking door!”

I could hear it behind me—clicking, creaking, dragging itself closer. I spotted a broom closet to my right and ducked inside, slamming the door and holding my breath.

My heart pounded so hard, I was surprised it wasn’t knocking against the wood.

Through a crack, I saw its light sweep across the floor—its screeching getting louder.

Then, a rat scurried into view.

The projector-beast stopped.

Its head twisted. A beam of light shone down on the rat. And in an instant—it was gone. Vaporized. Nothing left but the faint smell of singed fur.

Shit.

One near-death experience was bad enough. This? This felt like the end. Death by demon-projector wasn’t how I pictured myself going out.

Suddenly, the door burst open, flooding the room with bright, white light.

Ash stood in the doorway, holding up a mirror.

“Get back, you big old piece of shit!” they shouted, the mirror catching the creature’s light and reflecting it straight back at it.

The thing shrieked. A horrible, high-pitched screech that rattled my bones and filled me with pure, unfiltered panic.

Then—silence.

Ash lowered the mirror, panting.

“It’s safe. Come on out.”

I collapsed forward, the door resisting me at first. My arm was throbbing. I wasn’t sure if I’d broken it or if I was just being a bit of a coward. Honestly, I didn’t care.

Ash looked me over, eyes wide with a mix of fear and frustration.

“What the hell were you doing in there, man? How did you even get in?”

“I just… I hadn’t seen that part before. And it looked messy as shit. No one told me I couldn’t go in.”

Ash stared at me for a long moment, then sighed.

“Okay. New rule. If a part of the cinema opens up that you haven’t been shown—or better yet, a part that wasn’t there before—do not go in.”

I got to my feet slowly and started to apologize, but Ash cut me off.

“No, don’t apologize. That’s on me. I should’ve warned you. I just didn’t think this place would… open up so soon.”

They looked over their shoulder, like expecting the walls to move again.

“This place reveals itself slowly—like a Russian nesting doll. And every new layer is designed to trap you. So please… just be careful.”

Then, without warning, Ash threw their arms around me.

Not a casual coworker hug.

A real one. A heavy squeeze that said I’m glad you’re alive.

It caught me off guard—but I appreciated it more than I could say.

Two near-death experiences in one shift was definitely above my pay grade. Every step I took afterward was wobbly, like my bones had turned to jelly.

Luckily, it was time for my break.

And after everything I’d just been through, I was looking forward to it—even if it was just a figment of my mind.
I threw open the staff room door, greeted by the soft ding of a little bell above me.

The smell of freshly made pancakes drifted through the air, wrapped in the toasty aroma of slightly burnt bread. I stepped into the café—my little pocket of peace. I slid into my usual booth. The sponge beneath me deflated with a satisfying whoosh.

For the first time that evening, I felt… at ease.

I glanced around, expecting to see George—but instead, a woman stood behind the counter, making a fresh pot of coffee.

“I’ll be right with you, sugar,” she called over her shoulder. “Just give old Noreen a minute.”

That stopped me in my tracks.

New character unlocked? Great.

After the night I’d just had, my guard snapped right back into place. I’d come in hoping for a hint of normalcy—or at least whatever passed for normal here. I’m not great with surprises. Even the good ones tend to throw me off.

A larger woman with kind eyes and a messy bob approached, balancing a tray with practiced grace. She placed it down in front of me with a gentle rattle and smiled.

On the tray was, quite possibly, the most perfect breakfast I’d ever seen.

There was coffee and juice in ceramic and glass containers, a stack of six golden pancakes glistening with maple syrup and draped in crispy bacon. A basket of croissants and pastries sat to the side with a selection of jams and spreads. But the main event? A sausage sandwich on thick sourdough, absolutely bursting at the seams. A meaty, indulgent monument to breakfast.

Before I could speak, she leaned in and said, “Anything you don’t eat, don’t worry, sweet. I can always take it back for my George—he loves my breakfasts.”

I didn’t need to ask who she was. It was obvious. George’s wife. Somehow, that filled me with warmth.

If all this was a figment of my imagination, then at least my mind had been kind enough to give George someone who loved him.

I smiled, picked up my knife and fork, and tucked in.

It was phenomenal. The pancakes disappeared first, followed quickly by the sandwich. I restrained myself from devouring all the pastries—George would want those, and I was happy to leave a few behind for him.

Time moved strangely here. It felt like I’d been sitting there for hours, but when I checked my phone, only thirty minutes had passed.

Still, something had shifted.

The café began to feel more real. I could’ve sworn I heard birdsong outside. The windows fogged with condensation, but behind the mist, I saw faint flashes of colour, blurred movement—like traffic rolling past.

I didn’t care. I was happy. I felt safe.

And honestly? If this was a trap, I’d be fine staying here forever.

Noreen sat down across from me, tossing a towel over her shoulder and chuckling.

“My, my. You were hungry.”

“Noreen, that was the best bloody breakfast I’ve ever had. It was something else.”

I leaned back and patted my belly. She beamed, squeezing her fists up beside her face like a delighted schoolteacher.

“Oh, I’m so glad to hear it! It’s George’s favourite, and he said you’d love it.”

Then her expression shifted, softening.

“And how are you holding up, darling? Rough night, I hear?”

I told her everything. The near-death experiences. The anxiety. The pressure. And, oddly, I also shared the more mundane parts of my day—the bits before all the blood, ghosts, and monster projectors.

I normally wouldn’t open up like that. But something about Noreen made it easy to trust her. Like I could exhale for once.

That is, until I mentioned the man in the suit.

I described him in detail—the porcelain skin, the tuxedo, the cracked voice, and his strange offer to “help” me.

Noreen went quiet. Stone still.

“No… no, it can’t be,” she whispered. “Did you say he spoke to you?”

“Yeah,” I nodded. “He actually saved me. I gave the guy in the green coat the wrong size popcorn, and he—”

She raised a hand, cutting me off gently.

“Goodness… Okay. Listen to me, sweetheart. Don’t tell Ash about this. She’ll know when the time’s right, but it’s not my place to say more.”

“But who is he?”

“I can’t say much. I’m sorry, son. Just know—he does want to help you. But he’s… a very troubled man.”

She paused.

“Was.”

Before I could ask more, I was called back to shift.

As I stood, Noreen gave me a final warning.

“Remember what I told you, sweetheart. Not a word. They’re not ready yet.”

I nodded, reluctantly, and walked back out.



Ash was in the lobby, trying to manage a crowd of early guests for a film I’d never heard of. Apparently, it was real—and Ash insisted it was premiering tonight.

I knew better than to argue.

It was some Norwegian indie horror about a group of friends trapped in a haunted bed and breakfast. Cult following. Weird energy.

The line dwindled until only one figure remained.

We thought he was just another customer—until he stepped forward.

Hood up. Long black coat. No visible face. Just an envelope, pulled from inside the coat and placed gently on the counter in front of us.

Without a word, he turned and walked out the doors.

Ash and I stared after him, then looked down at the envelope.

It read:
“Coming soon to a theatre near you.”

Inside?

Just one name.

William.

Ash’s face turned the colour of chalk. Their hands trembled slightly as they crumpled the letter and shoved it into their pocket.

“Okay, mate. You can go home. Punch your ticket. Shift’s over.”

“Don’t worry, Ash. I’ve still got an hour and—”

“I said NOW.”

They turned and stormed into their dad’s office.

I didn’t argue.

It was overtime anyway. One missed hour wasn’t going to kill me. Especially not compared to what almost had.

One of the morning crew had already clocked in, so I headed toward the exit.

As I stepped out, I paused for a moment—just long enough to feel the warmth of the rising sun on my face. A breath of relief escaped my chest, shaky but grateful.

But then—

A whistle.

Coming from behind me.

I turned.

Standing at the top of the stairwell where Ash had shouted at me just a few nights ago… was the man in the suit.

He waved.

A slow, theatrical wave.

And that grin—wide, sharp, and twisted into something I couldn’t quite place.

I gave a reluctant wave back.

Then I turned, walked home, and now… here I am. Sitting and typing up another strange, disturbing night.

Thank you for listening to my last post, by the way. It still feels like a fever dream—but knowing there are people out there actually reading this? That means more than I can say.

That’s all for now.

But I doubt this is the last update I’ll be sharing.

**The Life of a Government Clerk** is a single player, turn-based, coffee break Roguelike game made with Godot engine. The game title comes from Chekhov's short story, **The Death of a Government Clerk**, while the core mechanics are inspired by Kafka's novel, **The Castle**, in which K witnessed two clerks delivering document by cart in a hotel.

This game is similar to a truck simulator. Pull a line of Carts (from 3 Carts to as many as you can) and travel around the office zone. Deliver Raw Files and Documents to Clerks and Officers. You only need to send 4 Documents to beat the game. However, care must be taken to keep the file supply chain running. Besides, every time you move, your Carts collect Trash automatically. You lose the game if all the Carts are fully loaded with Trash. Use your wit and in-game help from Servants and Service Stations to finish the job. More Challenges await if you are an experienced Clerk.",31,1753181304.0,roguelikes,4,0.98,False

When I got married, I chose a small bridal party made up of family and one friend. Two people who were not included were my cousin (Lexi) and friend (Emily) - both of whom were once close to me.

Lexi and Emily were my best friends in high school. During that time, I was dating my first serious boyfriend (Jake) - classic teenage first-love BS.

One year, we were all invited to a mutual friend Harry’s birthday party. I was supposed to attend as Jake’s plus-one. A day before the party, Jake told me he was taking someone else - Jess, a new friend of Lexi’s. I was devastated. All my friends still went, including Lexi and Emily, and I spent the night at home feeling completely blindsided.

A few days later, I was told that Lexi and Jake disappear into a room together for over an hour. When I confronted them, they denied anything had happened. I was heartbroken, but I tried to move on.

Not long after, at a small get-together, I noticed Lexi and Jake texting and acting suspicious. I ended up grabbing Lexi's phone and saw that they were texting each other - heart emojis, flirting, and Jake was telling her he loved her more than me. That was the moment I knew something had happened between them, no matter what they claimed. It was even harder to process because Lexi is my cousin - someone I grew up with.

After high school, I went off to university. I ended things with Jake in my first year after multiple women came forward about him cheating. In hindsight, he was a loser, and I’m so glad that ended.

At university, I met my now-husband. He supported me in every way - emotionally, professionally, and personally. During this time, Lexi and Emily basically disappeared. They didn’t like my new boyfriend, never reached out, and stopped inviting me to anything. I tried to reconnect, but Lexi was always “too busy.”

Emily, meanwhile, continued hanging out with Jake. It just felt crappy that she was still choosing to stay close with someone who had treated me so badly. She never asked how I was doing, never acknowledged it. Eventually, I gave up trying. And during a really difficult period in my life, neither of them was there at all.

Despite everything, I still invited both of them, and their families to my wedding. I wanted to be the bigger person. The wedding was amazing, afterward I realised they hadn’t brought a gift, not even a card or a thank you text. I didn’t hear from them again for years.

Then, two years later, I reached out to Lexi and she agreed to meet. She asked why Emily wasn’t a bridesmaid (though it felt like she was really asking about herself). I told her honestly - I kept it small, and neither of them had really been there for me.

It's been a good few years since then, I was called to support Lexi in her time of need but is it really my responsibility? Other then that I haven't really kept in contact besides a coffee here and there.

So... AITA for not including them in the wedding party?",1,1753181044.0,okstorytime,4,1.0,False

# Chapter 1 He Left For A Rich Girl

Aria's POV

I stood in front of the chapel.

Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.

The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.

Everything was perfect.

Except I wasn't the bride.

“I really need to see Jace today.”

I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.

""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.

I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.

But I have my reason to be here.

""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.

Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.

Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.

She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.

All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.

So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.

He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.

Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.

“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.

The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""

He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.

I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.

Instantly, I felt out of place.

Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.

And me?

I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.

""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.

No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.

But poverty had a scent, apparently.

""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”

“Thank you.”

The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.

And there he was.

The man I used to love.

Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.

Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.

When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.

""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.

And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.

Hey, Jace?!

That’s the best I could do?

His face was ice cold.

""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""

Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.

""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.

He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""

Wow.

I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.

I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.

""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""

Anger flared across his face.

""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""

“No.”

I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.

""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""

Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.

From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.

Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.

""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""

Was he fucking kidding me?!

""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.

“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”

He walked closer, smirking.

""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""

He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.

""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""

I was throwing my pride at his feet.

But he just laughed.

""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.

He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.

""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""

I widened my eyes in shock.

Then I slapped him. HARD.

“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.

""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""

Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.

Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.

God this couldn’t be any worse.

I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.

But I still let him get to me.

Now what do I do?

My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.

So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…

""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.

Too late.

I slammed right into the man in front of me.

He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.

His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.

In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.

“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.

This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.

When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.

Suddenly, I recognized who he was.

This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.

Jace’s brother-in-law.

THE legendary. Grayson Hart.

“Aria Collins?”

His voice was sexy and velvety.

He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.

Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.

But wait.

How did he know my name?

# Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV

Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?

I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.

But there was no way he’d know who I was.

“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.

He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.

“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.

He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.

I looked down. A blank check.

“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.

But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.

“God,” I muttered under my breath.

Can you believe these rich bastards?

They think they can buy everything with money.

People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.

“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”

Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.

Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.

“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.

I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.

These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.

After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.

“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.

“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.

But they blocked me.

“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”

They burst into laughter together.

“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”

I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.”

Their jaws dropped.

“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.

“And my perfume isn’t cheesy!” Sabrina screamed.

“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”

They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.

Rich people were assholes.

Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.

I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.

It’s almost night. But I had no idea where to go.

I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her to know how bad things had gotten.

I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.

So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.

She texted back right away inviting me to come over.

Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.

Then I heard them.

“Hey, nice shirt!”

A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.

I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.

“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”

Go away. Go away. Go away.

“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.

“Fuck off!” I snapped, my voice shaking.

But it only fired them up.

“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”

They grabbed my wrists, yanked my arms down. My T-shirt gaped open completely, revealing my lace bra. The cold air made my skin pebble. They laughed even louder.

I struggled and screamed. My wolf growled in rage.

Shifting in the city was illegal…but right now, I didn’t have a second choice…

Just then. Blinding headlights. Followed by screeching tires.

A silver car skidded to a stop inches away.

The door flew open. A deep voice thundered:

“Get in.”

I was too shocked that I didn’t think twice and obeyed. The car peeled away the second I shut the door.

“My suitcase!” I cried.

“Someone will get it,” he said darkly. “Address.”

I told the driver May’s, my body still shaking. Then he pressed a button. A privacy screen slid up between the front and back seats, sealing us in the back.

That’s when he turned toward me and leaned in. Like a beast ready to pounce.

His scent hit me. It’s sharp pine mixed with cold metal.

My head started to get dizzy.

“Walking on the street in that shirt was a mistake,” he said darkly.

“It got like this because of you,” I mumbled.

He snorted.

Then there’s the sound of rustling fabric. A heavy jacket landed across my shoulders. It was still warm from his body and carried his scent.

I held my breath.

Wearing his coat almost felt like…he was wrapping himself around me.

“Alpha Grayson…do you know me?” I whispered.

My gut told me that he would never do this for a strange girl. But if he knew who I was, he must know that I was his sister’s husband’s ex. That didn’t explain why he would help.

“We’ve met,” he said simply.

I stared at him, searching those icy gray eyes. He was staring at me too, with those cold, hungry, possessive eyes. I felt like I was completely naked in front of him.

“Aria,” he warned, voice thick and husky.

But I couldn’t control myself.

I was leaning forward.

Shit. Why did my body become so weird?

My skin was on fire. My panties were wet. All I wanted was more of his scent. More of his heat.

The next second his lips crashed onto mine. Hard. Rough.

I gasped and opened my mouth for him. His tongue slipped in and explored every inch of my mouth, making me shiver. His hands pushed into my torn shirt and grabbed my breast. I couldn’t control my moan when he touched my naked skin.

This…This was crazy.

He was a stranger, and most importantly, my ex’s brother-in-law.

And I was making out with him at the back of his car.

The crazy part was I didn’t even want to stop.

He lifted me onto his lap like I weighed nothing. I straddled his thighs and yanked at his tie as he bit my collarbone.

Then, suddenly, the car stopped.

“Alpha, we’ve arrived,” the driver said behind the screen.

That’s when it all froze.

His lips paused at my neck. I was still squirming on his lap, flushed and throbbing. But he shoved me off.

“We can’t do this,” he said coldly.",1,1753181038.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Here is our itinerary and some tips which we used or which we wish we knew before the trip. Can't miss things are **bolded**.

# Day1:

Arrived at the airport at 8AM, took a campervan, went to market to stock food and drinks and started our journey. Geysir, **Gullfoss, Seljandsfoss + Gljufrabui**, Skogafoss + Kvernufoss, Dyrholaey + Reynisfjara. Slept in Vik campsite (we wanted to go to Þakgil campsite but it got late and gravel road + rain changed our mind).  Gullfoss and Seljandsfoss are apsolutelly magnificent and a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Remember to bring rain jackets and be 100% waterproof so you have the option of going behind the Seljandsfoss and neat Gljufrabui. Dyrhoalaey offers nice views to Reynisfjara and you can also see Puffins from close proximity. Vik campsite offers showers until 10:30 / 11:00 PM and you need 300 coins to activate them for 5 minutes. There are separate shower rooms for males and females but each shower room consists of 6 showers which are not separated in any way. Take this in mind if you arrive late / don't do well with nudity.

# Day2:

Fjaðrárgljúfur, Foss á Síðu, Svartifoss, **Skaftafell,** FjallSarlon, **Jokulsarlon + Diamond beach,** Vestrahorn (Viking Village), slept at Fossardalur campsite.  
We had a problem with our campervan (servo pipe hose broke) and had to wait for rental agency to bring us another car (shoutout to [rent.is](http://rent.is) and their 24h customer support), so we didn't get to do all the activities planned for this day. Skaftaffel and Jokulsarlon offer very nice views of the glaciers without the need to hike for long periods of times and go to highlands. We had to do a bit of a night drive to get back for the time we lost waiting for a campervan and we experienced thick fog and rain during the last hour of the drive. Keep that in mind and always pay attention to the weather when deciding which campsite to pick.

# Day 3:

**Borgarfjörður eystri,** Rjukandi waterfall, **Stuðlagil canyon,** slept at **Campground Fjalladyrd**  
Borgarfjörður eystri offered some of the best views over the authentic Icelandic terrain we have seen during the trip. The place is not very touristy and also has some of the best hikes (Stórurð). What we want for are the Puffins and we were not disappointed. This is probably the best place for watching puffins and one that allows you to do so with the safest proximity (at one point Puffin was half a meter away from us over the fence). The whole place has a very chill vibe so we spent much more time here than initially planned (no regrets). It is 1h 15min detour from Egilsstaðir.  
If I had to pick one best thing I saw during our trip it would have to be Stuðlagil canyon. The canyon, ground around it, color of the water and waterfalls just feel out of this world. It motivated me to dig deeper into how this type of terrain is even possible. I also saw some people bathing even though the water seems very cold. Note: make sure to drive to the **east side**, of the canyon (you have a lot of explanations on google maps). West side just offers limited views from the viewing platform, while east side allows you to go into the canyon yourself.  
Campsite Fjalladyrd was the most beautiful campsite during our trip. It is moved from the road 1, in the middle of greenery, near a horse barn with hundreds of horses and even has cute little rabbits around the campsite. They have their own caffe and offer 24h showers. You have to pay for them on the reception but you can do this the next day (it's done on trust).

# Day 4: 

  
**Dettifoss + Selfoss,** Hverir, Grjotagja, Hverfjall, Myvatn baths, Slep at amping Hamrat at Akureyri  
There are also other places worth noting such as Krafla lake hike and Dimmuborgir which we didn't have time for (this time we got a flat tire).  
Dettifoss is super powerful and might not be as pretty as other waterfalls but it is a sighting for sure. Grjotagja is a cave where GoT was filmed, if you are fan of a show it's good to visit, if not anyway it's free and takes 5 mins. Myvatn baths are a bit cheaper than other touristy spots but offer just as much. Keep in mind you have to take a full naked shower before entering the baths: there are 2 showers with curtains and the rest are open.  Pay attention that when going to Akureyri you have to pay online for going through the long tunnel, there aren't many signs that you should do this. We wanted to sleep at Systragil but this was the only time during our trip that the campsite was full. Book in advance if you insist on it.

# Day 5:

  
**Akureyri Botanical Garden, Reykyafoss + Fosslaug**, Kolugljufur, Hvammstangi, slept at Sælukotið Árblik  
Botanical garden has free entrance and free parking. Takes 10-ish minutes to visit and is very beautiful, if you are in Akureyri definitely try to visit it.  
Reykyafoss would be the best sightseeing place at any country other than Iceland, but the main thing for us was Fosslaug. It is basically a hole with thermal water neat the waterfall where you can take a bath and relax. We had great company here so we spent more time than planned, but it was definitely on our list to take a bath in Iceland outside of the regular bathhouses. We mainly used this day for driving to prepare us for the trip to Snaeffelsnes

# Day 6: 

Snaeffelsnes: Kirkjufell, Bjarnafoss, Budakirkja, Ytri Tunga, Akranes, slept at Mosskogar campsite  
We prepared many more things for Snaefell such as Saxholl, Djupalonssandur beach, Londrangar, Hellnar, Raudfelgsgja, but sadly the weather was horrible with extremely thick fog and heavy rain. Take this with a grain of salt but doing the ring road you can see most of the dramatic landscape and scenery that you would in Snaeffels, but Snaeffels is more convenient to visit from Reykjavik. I read mixed reviews for Kirkjufell, and while it was nice to see I didn't feel like this is a top 10 attraction in Iceland. Mosskogar campsite is nice but it was the only place which accepted only cash. Might be worth to pre-book as it can get pretty full.

# Day 7:

**Reykjadalur hot spring thermal river,** back to rental agency and airport  
We wanted to visit thermal river during our first day but couldn't due to health concerns so we left it for the last day. There is about 1 hour of hiking before you reach it but the hike itself is beautiful and cool to experience. There is a lot of place for bathing at the river but no real hanging rooms. We greatly enjoyed it before heading home. Keep in mind this is the only place where the parking is paid by the hour instead of per-day. 

# Tips and tricks:

We rented with [rent.is](http://rent.is) and had a 10/10 experience. They have a 24 hour support and always assisted us with everything. We had a leaking servo oil hose and they got us a new campervan with full gas that same day and refunded us a day of renting.  
Only change I would do is I would get full insurance. We had a flat tire and mechanic (rental agency helped me find it) told me he does bout 10 of these per day during the summer. Either sloooow down on gravel roads or take the tire insurance and chill. Even though it was middle of July, some night were very cold and we were glad we took a van with a heating system.  
Try to take 2 sets of waterproof clothes so one set can dry while you wear another one. Take fast drying towels. If you can try to have small electric water boiler so you can have a coffee inside a van while it's raining. e-sim internet works fine.   
In order to make this trip possible time-wise we didn't prebook tours and restaurants. We shopped at Kronan / Bonus (should be cheapest) and stocked for 3 days in advance. Everyone speaks English, cash is mostly not needed.

Note: 7 day ring road trip is definitely doable, but you will have to let go of a few things. Don't be stressed about visiting everything: it's impossible. Enjoy the trip and give yourself time to chill if you particularly like a certain place.

1m6apu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1m6apu8/do_we_only_become_conscious_of_ourselves_through/,Do we only become conscious of ourselves through others?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about how real self-awareness begins.

A few months ago, I had an unexpected, deep conversation with a total stranger on the subway. He was reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, and I casually asked if he liked it. What followed wasn’t small talk, it felt like an accidental philosophy session. We spoke about ego, time, detachment, and identity for hours at a coffee shop nearby.

One thing he said stayed with me:

“You can’t look inward without first being mirrored by someone else.”

**That hit hard.**

I’ve spent years journaling, listening to psychology podcasts, practicing mindfulness, and reading philosophy. But somehow, this spontaneous conversation with someone I’ll probably never meet again gave me insights I couldn’t reach on my own.

Since then, I’ve been wondering:

* Is self-discovery even possible in isolation?
* Are strangers sometimes better mirrors than our closest friends?
* Do real breakthroughs only come when our thoughts are challenged in live dialogue?

The conversation made me feel seen, but more than that, it made me see myself more clearly. Not because he told me who I am, but because he listened in a way that brought me out of hiding.

I don’t know who he was. We never exchanged contact info. But he made me rethink what “consciousness” even means.",11,1753180915.0,askphilosophy,3,1.0,False

Instead, he's blessed with something better: **The Assistant** (or **chùlǐ**, if you're feeling linguistically adventurous). He's not just any sidekick — he's the one who makes the ML tolerable. Let's be honest: without the Assistant around, the brooding billionaire trope would've collapsed under the weight of its own emotional repression long ago.

And the best part? Many actors first get noticed playing the Assistant before moving on to play cold, emotionally unavailable CEOs themselves. Talk about a promotion pipeline.

# 💼 He's an Assistant... by Choice

Let's clear one thing up: this guy isn't a glorified secretary. He's a **licensed-to-kill-level lawyer**, a **business mastermind**, or an **ex-military strategist**. He could've been anything — CEO of his own company, head of a law firm, or at the very least a social media influencer with a clean aesthetic.

But no. He chooses to be the Assistant to this emotionally constipated boss — out of **loyalty**, **love**, and possibly a dash of **""I'm the only one who can manage this man's moods without crying""**. (and then he ends up managing the moods of two crazy people, instead of one)

Also, plot twist: since the ML is always a recluse, the Assistant ends up being the company's public face. You know, the one who actually shows up to meetings with sleeves rolled up while the ML sulks somewhere in a penthouse.

# 🛡️ Loyalty Level: Absolute

The Assistant is loyal like your grandma's cast iron pan — he doesn't bend, doesn't rust, and definitely doesn't forget. He's been with the ML through all the tragedies: childhood trauma, heartbreak, betrayal... and still shows up every morning with coffee and a 97-slide presentation. Or in the middle of the night to cater to the whims of his boss's misplaced appetite. Or to present the history of the woman he wants to destroy but secretly marry.

And if a woman dares to enter the ML's life, you bet he'll scan her LinkedIn, track her location, and set emotional landmines until he's sure she's not a gold-digger in disguise.

But hey — if things go too far and misunderstandings pile up like subtitles in a fast-paced scene? He'll even reveal the ML's secretly romantic side, hidden in a diary with smooth calligraphy and poems that no one knew he could write. Because deep down, he wants his boss to be happy... preferably without acting like a Victorian ghost in a power suit.

# 🧠 Resourceful, Smart — and He Gets Stuff DONE

The ML barks: ""Get me everything on XYZ.""

And the Assistant? Boom — files, photos, dental records, and maybe a hidden talent reel, all in one organized binder by lunchtime.

But he's not just a glorified spy. He has opinions. He even *warns* the ML when something seems off. Does the ML listen? Of course not. That would ruin the drama. But the Assistant tries anyway — bless his overworked heart.

Sometimes, when the ML decides to cosplay as a poor intern, he'll drag the Assistant into his web of lies — even introducing him as ""the boss."" And the Assistant? Oh, he leans into the chaos, calls the ML ""junior,"" and enjoys the power trip while it lasts. Iconic behavior.

# 🫶 He Cares — Maybe More Than He Should

His loyalty isn't about paychecks. It usually stems from **a dark backstory™**, where the ML once saved him from ruin, death, or bad haircuts. Since then, he's been stuck in a one-sided emotional support contract — part assistant, part therapist, part walking alarm clock.

He jokes about not having a personal life, but honestly, he's given up dating apps in exchange for managing the ML's mess 24/7. When the FL shows up and ML starts acting like an actual human? That's when the Assistant finally gets a breather. Maybe even a nap.

# 🧩 He's Practically Family

This guy isn't just close to the ML — he's woven into the very fabric of the ML's household. Got a moody patriarch or a concerned grandma? They ask **him** how the ML is feeling today. ML's kid? Calls him ""uncle."" ML's sister? Roasts him like a sibling. Honestly, he's got more family rights than some blood relatives.

He mediates family drama, manages emotional blowups, and still makes it to dinner. If you're wondering who the real glue of the family is, it's the guy in the suit with the Bluetooth earpiece and emotional damage.

# 🚪 He's the Gateway to the ML's Heart

No one just ""falls in love"" with the ML. First, they pass **The Assistant Test™**.

He's seen all the pain the ML hides behind that resting villain face, and he's not letting just anyone walk in and start rearranging his boss's emotional furniture.

But once he sees the FL isn't just a pretty face — once she proves she's either kind enough to melt ice or scary enough to fight fire with fire — he flips teams instantly. He becomes her biggest hype man. Honestly, sometimes he ships them harder than the audience does.

# 🧭 He's Also the ML's Moral Compass

Even cold CEOs need a Jiminy Cricket. When the ML goes off the rails with jealousy, vengeance, or ""I'm rich so I can ruin lives"" energy, it's the Assistant who steps in with the verbal slap.

He'll say what no one else dares: ""You're acting like a jerk. And if you keep hurting her, I'm OUT.""

Sometimes, he even calls the ML by his first name — gasp! — and that's when you know things are serious.

# 💅 He's Not Just a Pretty Face (But He Is That Too)

Same age, same jawline, better personality. He could be the ML in another drama. In fact, he probably *will* be.

He's always sharply dressed — suit, tie, maybe a trench coat in the rain for dramatic effect. Occasionally, he gets paired with the FL's feisty best friend, and together they become the B-side couple we never knew we needed.

# 🎤 Final Thoughts?

So the next time you find yourself swooning over the cold ML and wondering how he manages to survive without a therapist…

Look to the guy in the background — organizing chaos, making phone calls, and keeping the drama on track.

**He's not just the Assistant.**  
**He's the unsung MVP of every vertical drama.**  
**He's the Assistant.**

1m6alva,https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1m6alva/how_i_would_write_metallo_as_the_main_villain_of/,How I would write Metallo as the main villain of a Superman movie,"Metallo has always been one of my favourite Superman villains, and one that I'd love to see in a movie, but time and time again, I see the same comment regarding its feasibility. *""He can't work as a main villain, he would have to be the main henchman.""* As an aspiring writer myself, I thought I'd take this as a challenge on how I would make this seemingly secondary villain into the primary antagonist.

**Setup**

* Firstly, I'd go back to John Corben's original comicbook story where he was a journalist. I'd adapt it so that Corben is Jimmy Olsen esque in terms of his physical appearance (weedy and geeky looking) and that his personality is that off of a journalist who desperately wants to expose corrupt business tycoons after being inspired by Superman taking down Lex Luthor.
* At the beginning of the movie, he was working on a news story of him uncovering Morgan Edge as a criminal, however his primary news source was 'accidentally' killed in a hit and run. Therefore Corben becomes ever more desperate to expose the truth, and infiltrates Edge Industries by himself.
* He figures out that Corben has built a kryptonite bomb. Not wanting Edge to deny the truth, Corben sets the timer on the bomb, expecting it to only destroy Edge and his henchmen at worst.
* Edge alerts Superman to the scene, and tricks him into believing that Corben brought it himself. Superman disposes the bomb into space before it goes off, and hands Corben into the authorities. As Superman stopped him from exposing Edge as the corrupt man that he is, Corben begins to despise Superman.

**The Metallo robot**

* I'd have the Metallo robot be the creation of the military. Change Doctor Vale to General Vale, and make him a man so afraid of Superman's supposed godhood, that he wants to kill him in order to eliminate all possibilities of Superman turning evil (think Batman's motivation in BVS, only that it's really obvious that this is not who Superman is).
* Vale has Corben released from prison, and offers him the chance of vengeance, to help him out with his plan to have Superman legally executed (At this point in the movie, it would look like Vale is the main antagonist over Corben).
* Have Gerald Shugel have a small role as the first scientist to have successfully performed a brain transplant, and how he is working with the military to help transplant brains into machines. This will help explain how Corben becomes the robot later.
* Vale releases a convict from Strykers and sends the Metallo robot to attack him upon leaving. Superman arrives to try and save the prisoner, but the Metallo robot reveals his Kryptonite powers, defeats Superman, and vaporises the prisoner.

**Superman on trial**

* Metallo remains by Superman's side as he's locked up in order to ensure that he's is continuously weak. This demonstrates how powerful Metallo is against Superman.
* Vale visits Superman in prison, and explains his plan to put him on trial for the murder of the convict. A trial if found guilty, he will be executed by the Metallo robot. Corben also visits Superman, only he's there to mock his position, reveals his role as the prosecutor's main witness and gloats how he will have exclusive rights to cover the story of Superman's execution.
* Superman is found not guilty at trial, mainly due to his lawyer (I can't think of any famous DC lawyers) exposing Corben on the witness stand of committing perjury.
* Vale lambasts Corben for letting Superman off the hook, which causes Corben to go off the rails.

**John Corben becomes Metallo**

* Now determined to better himself against Superman, and knowing that he always goes out of his way to save Lois Lane, he secretly spikes Lois' morning coffee with a slow acting poison, convinced that Superman won't be able to save her.
* Before Superman could interrogate him, General Vale kidnaps him, and tortures him (24 style) in order to get him to reveal what type of poison he used, however Vale accidentally puts him in a coma during the interrogation. This makes him force Shugel to transplant Corben into the Metallo robot.
* Superman uses his intelligence to figure out the poison Corben uses, flies all the way to Africa in order to create the antidote, and flies all the way back to save Superman.
* After Lois Lane is saved, the transplant works, and Corben becomes Metallo.

**The finale**

* Vale is convinced that the military computers that control Metallo will overide Corben's free will, but he is wrong. Metallo breaks out of the military's control, killing several soldiers in the process, and proceeds to kidnap a recovering Lois Lane.
* Metallo takes Lois to Edge Industries, where he destroys all security measures in place and finds Edge at a business meeting with a known terrorist leader. Metallo throws the business leader out of the window to his death (presume the building is the same size as Lexcorp).
* Metallo then forces Edge to confess to his crimes, and forces Lois to interview him, and credit Corben for exposing the truth.
* Superman arrives to stop Metallo. He's shocked to see that Corben has become the robot, and Corben, filled with hate and vengeance abandons his original plan to try and kill Superman.
* After beating Superman to the verge of death, Corben is distracted by the military attacking him in an attempt to destroy him. Metallo and the military then fight each other, causing major damage and putting innocent lives in danger in the process.
* Despite being so weak, Superman still uses all his strength to save the innocents from the destruction, causing the onlookers to cheer his name.
* Metallo hears the cheers, angrily focusses his attention back on Superman, but with some quick witted thinking and skill, Superman is able to rip out Metallo's kryptonite power source.
* Metallo and Vale are both arrested, with Corben reading a newspaper story written by Clark Kent, on how his actions caused him to become the thing he worked so hard to destroy.

To me this story would help present Metallo as a major threat which pits Superman as the underdog, as well as showing off both his intelligence and humanity. It will also helps tackle the thought process of ""Superman could break any day now"" as something that Superman would never do.",1,1753180543.0,superman,1,0.67,False

The cottage nestled in among the trees, the name on the weather-beaten wooden sign on the gate read” School House Cottage”, because in the past, it was used to house one of the teachers from the village school.

The cottage was made from local Cotswold stone, with small, leaded light windows, a sturdy oak front door and a slate roof, the cottage was well weathered by countless winter storms.

It had sat empty for roughly five years, nobody really wanted to live in a cottage that was situated a mile out of the village, plus the few people who had tried to rent the cottage had soon left saying that there was an oppressive atmosphere there.

There were no nearby dwellings or buildings of any sort, in front of it were open fields that were used for grazing horses.

The estate agent had almost given up all hope of selling the cottage, when one day out of the blue, they received an email from a potential buyer.

The buyer was a single man, called James McElroy, he was a slim man in his mid-twenties, with neatly cut brown hair, and a neat moustache.

After looking around the cottage, which didn’t take long, as it was a single-story cottage, he put a bid in for it and that was accepted the same day, within a month, James McElroy moved into his new home.

James stood and surveyed his new home, this was exactly what he was looking for, after two years of living in a high-rise flat in Cirencester with the usual noisy neighbours either side of him, plus above and below him.

His new cottage was situated about a mile off of the Fosse way, roughly five miles outside of Stow-in-the-Wold.

The first thing that James had done after completing the purchase of the cottage was to get a stable internet connection installed, this ensured that he could work comfortably from home, 

The second thing was to get a decent security system to protect his belongings, after all, his computer was his livelihood.   

His first night living in his new home, he celebrated with a takeaway curry and a can of beer. After watching some lacklustre sit-com on the television, he decided to have an early night.

So, by eleven o’clock, James was laid in bed, he read a couple of pages of the latest Patrick Robison thriller, then he turned off his bedside lamp and was very soon sound asleep.

Unusually for him, he started to dream, a very vivid dream. In his dream, 

He was a man called Mr Whiteside, he was the school master at the local school, he taught a mixed class of boys and girls aged between 7 to 10 years old.

Mr Whiteside rose promptly at six thirty am, washed in cold water as usual, had his usual breakfast of toast with marmalade, and then left his cottage at seven thirty to walk the mile to the school to get it ready for the day’s classes.

Mr Whiteside was a tall, imposing man of six feet three inches, powerfully built, with jet black hair and beard, he was a brusque man, never known to smile.

He was very quick to anger, and very quick to use the cane on any and all miscreants, male or female, the females would receive six strikes of his birch cane across the palm of their hand, 

The birch twigs, he collected personally from the trees surrounding his cottage, he only selected twigs that were straight, and about 18 inches long.

These were stored in a metal pail of water that was kept by his desk, there were single twigs that he used on the girls’ hands, but for the boys, he had them tied in bunches of eight, this was to inflict more pain.   

He would only strike the girls on the opposite hand to their writing hand, so that they could continue to complete their schoolwork.

But the boys in the class would get caned across their naked buttocks, in front of the whole class. Mr Whiteside would delight in ensuring that the unfortunate boy would be left with blood trickling down the back of his legs after they had been caned.

In Mr Whiteside opinion, a day without a good caning, was a day wasted. Just the mention of his name was enough to strike terror into the hearts of the children in the area who were taught by him. 

Even some of the parents were a bit scared of him, he had a bit of a reputation of being a bully to anyone who crossed his path.

Nobody knew exactly where Mr Whiteside came from, he had been sent here by the education board, all the villagers knew was that he came from “away”, that was how they described anyone who wasn’t born within five miles from the village.

Any attempts to engage him in village life, were met with a curt refusal, so, over time, people just avoided him entirely, even going as far as crossing over the street to avoid him, this suited him perfectly well.

The dream faded and James woke up, at first he was confused, was he James or was he Mr Whiteside.?

A quick look in the mirror soon set his mind at rest,

He had a quick wash and then while eating his breakfast of muesli, and coffee, he wrote down everything he could remember from his very vivid dream.

Once he had finished, he got out his laptop and logged on to his company’s website and started his day of work.  

After work, he transferred his dream onto a word document, he thought, “if I dream again tonight, I can write it straight on to my laptop.”

Later that evening, James retired to his bed, within minutes, he was asleep.

Mr Whiteside strode purposely down the lane that led to the village of Upper Swell, there was a thick layer of fresh snow on the frosty ground, Mr Whiteside was wrapped up well in a thick coat, scarf, gloves, and hat.

As he walked past the village green, there were a group of about twenty children playing in the snow, building snowmen, and throwing snowballs at each other.

A snowball hit him in the back of the head, knocking his hat to the ground, he turned rapidly to face the children, but he couldn’t see who had thrown the snowball, and none of them would admit to it either.

Mr Whiteside said, “very well, all of you are in my class at school, so I will see you there on Monday morning, then if the culprit doesn’t confess, then all of you will be punished.”

He then continued to the village shop to collect his weekly groceries, brushing the snow from his Brown felt Derby hat as he walked, making a mental note of all of the children who had been playing in the snow.

On Sunday morning, Mr Whiteside walked to the local church for the usual Sunday morning service, he wasn’t particularly religious, 

but as a school master, it was expected of him to attend, he saw several of the children from his class in attendance as well, including some from the snowball incident from the day before.

He listened intently to the vicars sermon, and joined in with all of the hymns, a few of his class were in the choir, he smiled pleasantly at them as the service ended, and exchanged a few words with the vicar before heading home.

After a light lunch, he spent the afternoon, in the woods that surrounded his cottage, there he selected new birch twigs ready for all of the extra caning that he had planned for tomorrow.

Monday morning, he rose early, and after his breakfast, he walked to the school, and got everything ready for the coming day.

At 9:00, the children were all sat neatly at their desks, ready to start the day’s work, one of the boys put their hand up and requested to speak.

Mr Whiteside nodded at him and told him to speak, the boy, Edward Bishop, said, “Sir, on Saturday, none of the girls threw the snowball that hit you. So, please don’t punish any of them.”

Mr Whiteside thought for a moment then said, “very well, but this means that you personally will get extra strikes instead, do you understand.?”

Edward gulped hard and agreed to the extra punishment. 

Mr Whiteside said, “Come here, Edward, and take down your shorts.”

Edward slowly stood and walked stiffly to the front of the class. Mr Whiteside carefully selected a bunch of wet birch twigs from the bucket of near freezing water that they had been stood in.

Edward stood, white-faced beside Mr Whiteside’s desk, and slowly lowered his shorts to his ankles, bent over and grasped his ankles.

Mr Whiteside said, “as you have been so gallant as to take the punishment for the girls, you will receive two strokes for each girl in the class, as there are eleven girls in the class, that means you will receive twenty-two strokes across your posterior. Is that understood.?”

Edward managed to croak out a feeble “Yes Sir”.

Mr Whiteside said, “good, please be so kind as to keep count of each stroke, just so I know how many I have given you and how many I have left to administer.”

Again, Edward managed to say, “yes, Sir”

Mr Whiteside took a couple of practice swings of his birch cane and then brought it down, full force across Edward’s bare behind.

The sudden excruciating pain was unlike anything Edward had ever felt before, he managed to mutter the word, “one”.

Mr Whiteside kept administering extremely punishing blows to the boys exposed behind, lower back and thighs.

By the time he had finished the twenty-two blows, Edward Bishop had screamed himself hoarse and could barely stand and had to be helped back to his seat, with blood running freely down his legs. 

There he sat for the remainder of the school day, barely able to concentrate on his school work, when the school bell rang, 

Edward tried to stand up, but the blood from his lacerated behind had congealed through his shorts, sticking him to his seat. 

Mr Whiteside walked over to him and grasped him firmly by his arms and yanked him out of his seat, this elected another scream of agony from Edward, and reopened the wounds that covered his lower back and behind.

Two of Edwards friends helped him from the school room, while another ran to ask his own father to bring the horse and cart as there was no way that Edward would be able to walk home in the condition he was in.

Mr Whiteside stood at the school door, with a sadistic smile on his face as he watched the boys half carry Edward out of the school, he made one comment, “don’t be late tomorrow Edward.”

Billy Smith’s father soon arrived with his horse and cart, straight from out of the field, as soon as he saw the state of Edward, he told his son, Billy to run to the pub and fetch Edwards father.

Very soon there was an angry mob gathered at the local pub, after news of Edwards condition had spread around the village.

The village Dr had examined the injuries and was thoroughly shocked, never in his twenty-five years of service, 

Had he seen such brutal punishment doled out to anyone, least of all to a nine-year-old boy, and this had included with the British army in the second Boer war.

The village policeman was soon on the scene, and was asking a lot of questions, Edward was too delirious to answer them coherently, so, Billy Smith answered for him.

At this point, James McElroy awoke in his comfortable bed, with the stark memories of his dream burnt into his brain, he grabbed his notebook and quickly wrote down his “dream” while he remembered it.

He sat on the side of his bed, visibly shaken, was this just a dream, or had this really happened, in the past, had Mr. Whiteside existed, had he really severely, punished a young boy while he was the schoolmaster at the local village school?

James decided to investigate more, first he tried googling the name of the village, all that told him was about the location of the village, when it was formed, etc. Nothing was mentioned about a Mr. Whiteside, or an Edward Bishop.

So, James took a stroll down to the local village church, which was an imposing building, built from Cotswold stone with a rustic lychgate at the entrance to the well-tended churchyard.

Inside the church it was quiet and dark, the only light was what came in from the stained-glass windows, at the front of the church was a portly man, dressed in black trousers, a black shirt, and a clerical collar around his neck.

The man introduced himself as Father Michael Malloy, he had a soft Irish accent that James knew was from County Cork in Southern Ireland.

James explained what he was inquiring about, and Father Mike, as he had asked to be called, invited him over to the Manse for a cup of tea, so that they could talk in comfort.

Father Mike said, “yes, Mr Whiteside, he was the village schoolmaster here long before I came here, think it was around 1905 or so, terrible business, he whipped a boy so severely that the boy ended up in the local cottage hospital. 

The boy’s parents complained to the school board, but they sided with Mr Whiteside, the parents tried to get the police involved, but they weren’t interested.

For a few weeks, there were complaints made by Mr Whiteside, that his windows were getting broken, and that cow dung was spread over his garden path.

The police couldn’t find any culprits, so the matter was ignored, then one day, about two months later, Mr Whiteside, did not arrive at the village school as usual. 

The school secretary made the one mile walk to Mr Whiteside’s cottage and found the cottage empty, the door was unlocked, the table set for a meal and food prepared in the kitchen, but no sign of Mr Whiteside.

The school secretary, Miss Cooper, walked back to the school and reported the absence to Mr Brown, the headmaster.

Mr Brown thought it strange enough that he sent a message to the local police house, Constable Edwards rode his old heavy police issue bicycle from the village out to “School House Cottage”.  

He painstakingly searched the small cottage, and found nothing untoward, so he locked the cottage and cycled back to the police house to write his report about the missing schoolmaster.

Over the next week, Mr Whiteside was absent from his post at the village school, so, the headmaster had to take over his class.

The following Sunday, Andy Wilson, a local poacher, was out in the woods that surrounded School House Cottage, checking his rabbit snares, when he came across a grisly sight.

Mr Whiteside’s body was laid next to a Birch tree, his head was covered in congealed blood. Andy Wilson quickly made his way into the village and reported his findings to Constable Edwards at the police house.

Constable Edwards made his way back to the woods with Andy Wilson, confirmed that the body was that of Mr Whiteside and that he was dead from a head injury.

Constable Edwards made a speedy return to the police house and sent a telegram through to the police station at Cheltenham and asked for the murder squad to be sent out.

Two officers arrived later that day, after having travelled by train to Stow-in-the-Wold and then having to travel by horse drawn coach to the village.

The officers were dropped off at the police house, by now, the light was fading as it was early February, so, the two officers, Inspector Monroe, and Sergeant Collins, sat with Constable Edwards and discussed the case.

At first light the next day, the three men made their way out to School House Cottage and into the adjoining woods.

Mr Whiteside’s body lay against a tree, Sergeant Collins made a quick examination of the body, death had been caused by repeated blows to the head. 

Then Herbert Whiteside’s body was taken to a room at the local cottage hospital for a proper examination. The following morning, Mr David Martin, the chief surgeon conducted the post-mortem.

This revealed that Mr Whiteside had died from repeated blows to his head and body, both of his arms were broken, as well as most of his ribs, but it was his face and head which had sustained the most damage.

There were multiple fractures to his skull, both of his eye sockets were broken, his nose had been smashed virtually flat with the rest of his face, his jaw had been separated from his skull and dangled loosely from the tendons in his face.

Mr Martin concluded that Mr Whiteside had been the victim of a brutal and sustained attack, the first blow had been struck from behind, knocking him to the ground, his arms were broken as he tried to defend himself, the rest of attack took place while Mr Whiteside lay helpless on the ground.

The police conducted interviews of the local villagers, but as School House Cottage was located a mile outside of the village, nobody had seen or heard anything.

The last time that Mr Whiteside had been seen was at the village church on the previous Sunday morning. From the look of the food that had been left prepared in his kitchen, it appeared that Mr Whiteside had left his home on the Sunday afternoon, to collect Birch twigs ready to use for punishing his pupils.    

Some of the locals mentioned a tramp who had been seen in the local area around that time, there had been a few rabbit snares placed in the woods,

But this man was never located, despite a manhunt for him, there were a few scattered sighting of him but he eluded capture.

Before long, the murder of Mr Whiteside was brushed from people’s minds and life in the sleepy village went on, just like it had for hundreds of years.

Ten years later, war had engulfed Europe, and Edward and Billy, like so many young men across the country, answered Lord Kitchener’s call for one million men to fight for King and Country.

Both of them were killed on the morning of the first of July 1916, just two among the 19,240 men who were cut down by the German machine guns.

By the time the Somme offensive ended 141 days later, nearly 109 thousand British soldiers had died on the Western front.

Edward and Billy’s bodies were not recovered, lost in the carnage and devastation of the hell that was the Somme.

Eleven years later, their names would be added to walls of the Menen Gate Memorial, among the other more than 54,000 soldiers who died in the Great War and have no known grave.

Edward and Billys parents both received black edged telegrams on the third of July, informing them that their sons were missing in action.

Both families were devastated by this news and waited in vain for news of their sons. On the eleventh of November 1918, the Great war was over. 

Both families waited to see if their sons would return, but they never came home. In 1921, the village erected a war memorial engraved with the names of the men from the village who had fell for King and Country, including Edward and Billy, there were two other young men who had lived in the surrounding area.

Edward’s father Frederick, took the loss of his son very badly and started drinking heavily, and died less than five years after the memorial was erected.

Billy’s father John, died of pneumonia after being caught out in heavy rain in 1928.

James, went to bed, his notebook placed on the bedside table, ready for him to write down any dreams that he might have during the night.

Mr Whiteside rose early as was his custom, washed in cold water, ate his breakfast of eggs and bacon as it was the sabbath, after finishing, he washed up his plate and cutlery before donning his black winter coat.

He surveyed his reflection in the hall mirror, after brushing a few specs of dust from the shoulders of his coat, he picked up his hat and left his house and headed for church.

After the morning service, he returned to his cottage, the chicken that he had left in the oven, was smelling good, so he quickly put on the rest of his dinner.  

After eating, he washed up, and left the table set for his evening tea, and then he took a stroll into the woods to collect some fresh birch twigs to make into canes for his pupils.

While he was busy snipping off nice straight birch twigs, he failed to hear the sound of footsteps of the people who came up behind him.

When Mr Whiteside turned, he saw that he was surrounded by four people, they were Frederick  Bishop, Edward Bishop’s father, John Smith, Billy Smith’s father, Andy Wilson, the local poacher, and most surprisingly was George Edwards, the local policeman.

He smiled warmly and said, “gentlemen, what do I owe this pleasure too, couldn’t you have spoken to me after Church this morning.?”

Frederick Bishop said, “what I have to say is not for the ears of the vicar or the ladies of the village. Now you will tell me, why did you beat my son so severely that he needed a week in the cottage hospital, and a further two weeks in bed at home.?”

Mr Whiteside said, “well, your son, decided that he would be a gentleman and stand up for the girls in my class, and take their punishment for throwing a snowball at me, that is why he received so many strokes of the birch. 

Two strokes for each girl times eleven equals twenty two strokes, that is what he received, no more, no less.”  

Saying this, Mr Whiteside turned back to collection birch twigs, with a sudden fit of temper at the school teachers callous disregard for his son, Frederick Bishop swung the heavy stick he was using and brought it down hard on the back of Mr Whiteside’s head.

Mr Whiteside sank to his knees, the back of his head turning red with blood, he raised himself onto one elbow and said, “I will have you locked up for this.”

Without thinking, Frederick Bishop brought his stick down again on Mr Whiteside’s head, Mr Whiteside tried to protect his head and put his arm up, the heavy stick broke it like a pencil. 

Frederick Bishop continued to rain heavy blows down on the figure lying prone on the ground in front of him, as he paused to catch his breath, he realised that his three companions had joined in with him in beating Mr Whiteside.

Slowly, they stopped and looked down at the battered body that lay crumpled at their feet, and they exchanged a glance, that said, “We keep silent about this.” 

They quickly came up with a cover story and blamed a tramp who had been seen in the area. Being a Police officer, P.C Edwards put entries in his log book about various sightings of this fictious tramp.

The four made their way out of the woods and returned to their homes, after swearing each other to total secrecy.

James woke up and quickly wrote down his “Dream.” Then he showered, ate breakfast, had a large black coffee, and switched on his computer and started his days work.

After work, he edited his “dream” into some semblance of order and readability, he read it through, he sat and thought, it read like a thriller, but one that was based on an element of truth.

As he often did when he was puzzled about something, he phoned his mum, Angela, and told her about his strange dreams, Angela said, you had a great uncle called Herbert Whiteside, he was a school teacher, he died in unexplained circumstances. 

His mother said, “let me check some old papers and I’ll call you back later.”

His mother called him back and said, “ What was the name of the village that you are living in.?”

James said, “it’s called Upper Swell, it’s just outside Cirencester, Why.?”

His mum said, “that’s the place were your great uncle Herbert Whiteside was working as a schoolmaster until he was killed, Sunday 12th of March 1905, unsolved, beaten to death by a suspected tramp.

James, it looks like you have solved an old family mystery, something that has puzzled the family for over a hundred years. Well done, I’m sure he will rest a lot easier now.”

That night when James went to bed, he didn’t dream about Herbert Whiteside. It looks like the curse has been broken.

The End

Two months ago, we moved into a big new house together.    
Last Friday morning, while having our usual morning coffee in bed, he calmly said: *“We need to break up.”* Within 24 hours, he packed his bags and left. Not just the house, he left the country.  
For clarity: we were living together in my home country but he's from a different one.

I thought we were working on aligning our future goals and that we were in it together. I had supported him during his studies and it was finally my turn... Now I'm left trying to figure out how to recalibrate.  
  
On the practical side: We have a two-month notice period on the lease, so he’s still legally and financially tied to this place. But since walking out, he’s pretty much ghosted me. He initially agreed to “have a conversation to honour what we shared.” When I asked him *when* would suit, he left me on 'read'*.* Month end is looming.

So, here I am, picking up the pieces of a life we built, taking care of our dog (who was also *his* responsibility but he chose to discard), dealing with bills and practical fallout, while he’s probably living it up, “free”, single and unbothered.

I know this man. This is his classic avoidant behavior. I already know he's the type to ""get over someone by getting under someone"", but besides this heartache and bitterness... I need him to **contribute financially** for the remainder of the notice period and take some accountability for the commitments he made.   
Not to me, but to our dog and the house. I don’t want to be the “nagging ex.”   
  
Will it escalate things and make me look petty or vindictive? Feels like I’d be a total pushover if I let him off the hook.  
  
**WIBTA if I demanded he pay his share?**

**EXTRA RELEVANT INFO:**

* We were splitting all costs 50/50 before he left.
* The lease is in *both* our names.
* We paid off a car we bought (at mate's rates from my mom) it's still here.
* He hasn’t outright said he won’t pay, but pushed back when I asked him about it in person before he left.

ps. Don't worry - I am in therapy and I am putting my *emotional* needs first for a change. As with most relationships, things weren't always perfect but we were a stellar team. However, I've started realising just how much of the emotional heavy-lifting I had been doing.

TL;DR  
Ex dumped me, left the country, pretty much ghosted me, and I’m left with the house/dog: **how do I get him to pay his share?**",4,1753180231.0,AITAH,3,0.84,False

The organization that Truman agreed to create in order to provide the president with solid intelligence information quickly became a disorganized mess sprouting covert disasters probably unknown even to him. Allen Dulles had a habit of leaking news of successful CIA operations to the press and keeping its many failures as secret as possible. As for Wisner, fueled with a constant stream of nicotine, coffee, and alcohol, he continued to run covert operations against the Soviets until he had a mental breakdown in 1957 and got shuttled off to the care of a CIA psychiatrist. After receiving electro-shock therapy, the CIA thought he was well enough to be sent home in semi-retirement, but he shot himself.

Wisner was a manic-depressive. Just about everything he tried to do blew up. He would get on a high all geared up and excited while planning an operation and then fall into despondency once it failed. Then he’d repeat the process over and over and over again. By the end of his life, he became obsessed with the idea that Nazi leader Martin Bormann had escaped to South America. He “was on a thing about this that we should pool our sources and resources and get Bormann,” his daughter recalls, “he talked about the mysterious and sinister figure of Martin Bormann. He wrote millions of letters. If there really was a CIA connection to Bormann in South America, who knows if he wasn’t feeling terrible about it? If he’s starting to yell and scream about Nazis, who in the CIA is starting to get worried about it? Was he hallucinating?” The University of Virginia 7 Society, of which he had been a member, placed a floral display at his funeral.

Wisner’s job was the impossible. As for President Truman, he had become annoyed with what he was getting out of the CIA. The agency had failed to predict the North Korean invasion of South Korea, the communist win in China, and the successful test of an atomic bomb in the Soviet Union. What good was it if it couldn’t tell the president what was happening in the world? So Truman appointed General Walter Bedell Smith to take over as CIA director and crack heads.

Smith served in World War II as General Eisenhower’s chief of staff and accepted the surrender of the German armed forces. Churchill called him America’s bulldog, because Ike had a habit of handing him tough duties he didn’t want to have to do himself, especially ones that might make people angry. After the war, he served as ambassador to the Soviet Union until Truman asked him to come back to the United States to fix the CIA.

At his first agency staff meeting, he looked around the table and said, “It’s interesting to see all you fellows here. It’ll be even more interesting to see how many of you are here a few months from now…‌I expect the worst, and I am sure I won’t be disappointed.” He discovered that the CIA had 400 people working on Truman’s daily intelligence briefing and 90 percent of what they were putting together was nothing but rewritten State Department reports, while almost all of the rest of it consisted of worthless filler. It was a bunch of junk.

Smith called Larry Houston, the CIA’s head lawyer, and told him to bring him all of the agency’s personnel charts. He snapped question after question at him. He wanted to know what this individual’s job was. What this group did. Why was the Office of Policy Coordination not under the direct and complete control of the CIA director, but bureaucratically linked to the State Department?

General Smith ordered Houston to draw up an order to directly incorporate the Office of Policy Coordination into the CIA. Houston wanted to know if Smith wanted to look over the legal papers to get this done. “I’m not interested in seeing anything. Just do it,” he ordered. The OPC became the division of Clandestine Services of the CIA.

He couldn’t see how he could simply fire Wisner, because Wisner had many of the details of current CIA operations stored in his head and not put on paper. So he appointed Allen Dulles to deputy director of plans—‌a cover title for chief of covert operations—‌to try to control him. But the agency’s Tom Folgar found that “Bedell clearly doesn’t like Dulles, and it’s easy to see why. An army officer gets an order and he carries it out. A lawyer finds a way to weasel. In CIA, as it developed, an order is a departure point for a discussion.”

The general didn’t trust Dulles or Wisner. At daily staff meetings, he would question them about CIA activities and get vague responses. He ordered them to create a list of their covert operations. They just kept putting him off. One of his aides remembers that “in exasperation he visited upon them more violent manifestations of his wrath than he did upon anybody else” and was frightened that some stupid unknown “blunder overseas might become public knowledge.”

The agency was in fact gearing up for a major covert operation in Iran. The nation had been ruled by a king until he was forced to abandon his throne during World War II. He made the mistake of declaring himself neutral and harboring pro-Hitler sympathies. As a result, England and the Soviet Union jointly occupied the country during the war and then left. The British let his son Shah Reza Pahlavi come back and allowed the country to elect its own parliament. In 1951, parliament appointed a fiery nationalist, Mohammad Mossadegh as prime minister.

The new prime minister of Iran nationalized the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (now known as British Petroleum or BP), which at the time was the third-largest crude oil company in the world. England wanted to overthrow the prime minister and get the Shah to become the absolute ruler of Iran. Allen Dulles liked the idea.

Dulles knew the Shah well. When he worked at Sullivan & Cromwell, he represented him as his business lawyer in the United States and introduced him to the world of the American power elite at a special Council on Foreign Relations dinner in his honor. The Shah shook hands with Nelson Rockefeller, William Donovan, and Henry Luce of *Time* and *Life* magazines. Dulles also did work for Overseas Consultants Inc., an engineering firm doing work in Iran. On one trip back from Iran, a friendly reporter bumped into Dulles and compared him to a “cultivated Roman Senator watching over imperial provinces.”

Dulles sent Kermit Roosevelt to England to coordinate with the British on Operation Ajax—‌the new CIA code word for their plan to overthrow Mossadegh. They had one big problem, though. President Truman wasn’t too excited about the idea of overthrowing a foreign government simply to protect the interests of a British oil company. The Arabian-American Oil Company (now known as ARAMCO) had made a deal with Saudi Arabia to split its oil profits fifty-fifty. Truman tried to get the British to make a similar deal with Mossadegh, but they refused.

The political winds changed once Dwight D. Eisenhower became president and appointed John Foster Dulles to serve as secretary of state. The British got a little smarter too and sold the need to overthrow Mossadegh as a defense against Communism. They told the White House that if Mossadegh stayed in power, it “would be widely regarded as a victory for the Russians” and warned that England had to have control of Iranian oil in the Cold War, “because of the power it gave us to control the movement of raw materials” in “our common defense.”

Mossadegh wasn’t a communist and Eisenhower knew it, so Kermit Roosevelt refined the message. He said that if he stayed in power, communists would gain power in the Iranian Parliament and eventually take over. That was enough. Ajax was a go. However, the CIA station chief refused to take part. He had been working in Iran for years and thought it was a mistake to ally the United States with what he saw as British imperialism. He warned that if the coup were to succeed, then in the long run Iranians would grow to hate the United States for its support of “Anglo-French Colonialism.” Dulles transferred him out of the country and sent Roosevelt to take his place.

Roosevelt arrived in Iran with several million dollars. He gave an Iranian general seventy-five thousand dollars to lead the coup. The plan was for him to seize power and then let the Shah take over. Roosevelt paid newspaper reporters to create stories saying that Mossadegh was against Islam and corrupt. He paid others to spread rumors that he wanted to smite the Iranian army and let the Soviets come in. He used several hundred thousand dollars to pay people to join a mob and storm Mossadegh’s home. Thinking that thousands were now against him and ready to kill him, he fled.

The operation worked. The Shah proclaimed Mossadegh a criminal and sentenced him to house arrest for life. He created a secret police force that put his picture up all over the country and jailed anyone who talked against him. The oil interests were protected and the Shah served as a faithful ally to the United States until his own fall in the 1970s.

At the time, the coup seemed like a great success. The CIA basically sent one agent to Iran with several million dollars and changed its government. It gave Allen Dulles and other agency leaders the feeling that they could do just about anything. When it was over, Roosevelt came back to the United States and gave a debriefing to the White House. Eisenhower had promoted Dulles to director of the CIA and moved Walter Bedell Smith into the State Department to work under the other Dulles brother.

“One of my audience seemed almost alarmingly enthusiastic,” Roosevelt remembers, “John Foster Dulles was leaning back in his chair. Despite his posture, he was anything but sleepy. His eyes were gleaming; he seemed to be purring like a giant cat. Clearly he was not only enjoying what he was hearing, but my instincts told me that he was planning as well.”

He was. John Foster Dulles was thinking about Guatemala. One of his old Sullivan & Cromwell clients, the United Fruit Company, had been lobbying him to push for regime change there. If the government of Iran could be replaced at the touch of a button, then perhaps this Latin American government could be too.

**The people of Guatemala had made the mistake of electing Jacobo Arbenz as their president. The country was stricken with poverty and underdevelopment. Half of the farmland in the country was owned by 300 families and the United Fruit Company, which was the largest landowner in the nation. Despite rich farmland, the country had to import much of its basic foods, because only a quarter of the land was under cultivation. Arbenz wanted to buy this land and give it to people to farm as part of a plan to modernize the nation’s economy by building a middle class that would lead to a more diversified commercial base.**

<*CN*: I.e., land reforms.>

**The landowners opposed this idea in fear that it would make cheap labor disappear by raising the standard of living of the masses. Arbenz also angered the United Fruit Company by offering its operators tax-assessed value for their land. Internal company documents showed that the company valued its land at nineteen times the value it was reporting to the government. The company also underreported its production by 700 percent in order to escape taxes.**

The company started a two-prong campaign to get the United States to intervene in Guatemala. First, it hired advertising pioneer Edward Bernays, who authored a book titled *Propaganda*, to begin a public relations campaign that portrayed the company as an agent of freedom and Arbenz as a communist devil. Bernays argued that “the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.”

Bernays claimed he had a list of twenty-five thousand journalists, editors, and leaders who he said created the opinions of the American people. He put together five two-week “fact-finding” paid trips with ten newsmen on each one. Thomas McCann, who worked for United Fruit and managed the trips, said they were made with the “precision of a space shot” and were a successful “attempt to compromise the objectivity” of the reporters.

Soon articles appeared on the front pages of newspapers across the United States, including the *New York Times* and the *New York Herald Tribune*, with headlines such as “Communism in the Caribbean.” A correspondent for the *New Leader* took some of his writings and published a book based on them titled *Red Design for the Americas*. **In reality, according to the CIA’s own internal history of its operation in Guatemala, there were only four thousand communists in the country and four in its sixty-one-seat Congress. The country had a population of three million people, so the idea that it was full of communists was nonsense. But it made for good copy.**

**The United Fruit Company also hired Thomas Corcoran, a lawyer who had been one of the most well-connected lobbyists in the Washington beltway since Franklin Roosevelt had been president, to represent the company and its interests. Corcoran had served as the head lawyer for one of the CIA’s front companies, the Civil Air Transport Company, and was close to Walter Bedell Smith and Allen Dulles. So he acted as a liaison between United Fruit and the CIA. According to Howard Hunt, “Tommy the Cork began lobbying in behalf of United Fruit and against Arbenz. Following this special impetus, our project was approved by the National Security Council.”**

**Eisenhower gave the green light for Operation PB/Success, the CIA code name for the overthrow of Arbenz. Allen Dulles offered the job to Kermit Roosevelt, but he didn’t want to do it. “I told Allen that this will only work if the people, or at least the army, want the same thing you do. I wasn’t convinced that the same conditions existed in Guatemala. I didn’t think the Guatemalan people, the Guatemalan farmers, wanted what Foster Dulles wanted for them,” Roosevelt recalls, “I looked into it and it didn’t add up.”** <*CN:* Well that’s what NGOs are for.>

Colonel Frank Holcomb, who was the CIA’s deputy chief of the Western Hemisphere Division told Wisner, “What Teddy Roosevelt did in Panama will pale by comparison with what you’re planning to do in Guatemala. You’ll start a civil war and have the blood of thousands on your hands.” Wisner and Dulles picked Al Haney to operate as field commander of the operation and Tracy Barnes as its chief of political warfare. Their plans took what the CIA did in Iran as a starting blueprint.

**Barnes got Howard Hunt to work on creating propaganda and radio broadcasts in Guatemala that spread rumors to confuse people and scare them. “If possible fabricate big human interest story, like flying saucers, birth sextuplets in remote area,” ordered Haney. Hunt spread rumors that the Soviets were arming communist death squads.** <*CN*: Help create a problem your organization has cause to solve. Need a raison d’etre.>

Haney armed Castillo Armas, a disaffected Guatemalan general with a force of about 200 men in Honduras. They crossed the border into the country. A few American airplanes dropped bombs on the capital. Howard Hunt and his men ran radio broadcasts talking about make-believe Armas victories throughout the country. “What we wanted to do was a terror campaign to terrify Arbenz particularly, to terrify his troops, much as the German Stuka bombers terrified the population of Holland, Belgium, and Poland at the onset of World War II,” Hunt remembers.

*CN:* PsyOp.

From *Eros and Magic* by Ioan Coulianu,

“**For a magic process to succeed - as Bruno never tires of repeating - it is essential that the performer and the subjects be equally convinced of its efficacity.** *Faith* is the prior condition for magic: ""There is no operator - magician, doctor, or prophet - who can accomplish anything without the subject's having faith beforehand"" (*De Magia,* III, p. 452), whence Hippocrates' remark: ""The most effective doctor is the one in whom many people have faith"" (ibid., p. 453). ""It is generally agreed . . . that not only must we be credulous, we who act upon them, but the patients must be also. That is the essential condition, without which nothing can be achieved"" (*De Magia mathematica,* VI, vol. III, p. 495). ""Faith is the strongest bond, the chain or chains \[*vinculum vinculorum*\] of which all others are, so to speak, the progeny: hope, love, religion, piety, fear, patience, pleasure . . . , indignation, hatred, anger, contempt, and so on . . ."" (*De Magia,* LIII, vol. III, p. 490). **""It is essential that the performer (of magic) have an active faith and the subject a passive faith. Especially is the latter important because without it no operator, either rational or divine, can accomplish anything"" (ibid.).**

It is obvious that the ignorant are more readily won over by the phantasms of theology and medicine:

* It is all the easier to enchain (*vincire*) people who have less knowledge. In them, the soul opens un such a way that it makes room for the passage of impressions aroused by the performer's techniques, opening wide windows which, in others, are always closed. The performer has means at his disposal to forge all the chains he wants: hope, compassion, fear, love, hate, indignation, anger, joy, patience, disdain for life and death, for fortune. (*De Magia,* III, pp. 453-54)

It is not by chance that the prophet is mentioned alongside the magician and the doctor. The most obvious result of Bruno's thought is that all religion is a form of mass manipulation. By using effective techniques, the founders of religions were able, in a lasting way, to influence the imagination of the ignorant masses, to channel their emotions and make use of them to arouse feelings of abnegation and self-sacrifice they would not have experienced naturally.

Statements of this kind can be easily misunderstood, giving credence to the belief that here Bruno is making a sociological criticism of religion. This is far from the case, for he does not try to ""to show it up"" but only to look at it from a wider angle from the point of view of the manipulator. Bruno does not condemn religion in the name of humanitarian principles which are completely foreign to him. Moreover, he is not interested in religion per se but rather in the way in which any religion can be established if it finds the masses predisposed to accept it and a message suitable for their conversation. **As regards the manipulator himself, he will be persuasive and unshakeable in his faith and power to convince the more he has succeeded in smothering in himself and others** ***philautia,*** **self-love, egotism** (*De vinculis,* III, p.652, 675). **Everything is manipulable, Bruno teaches us; but the manipulator has no right to use his power over the masses for selfish ends. On the other hand, it seems that self-love in the subject facilitates in some way the creation of ""bonds.""**‘

<…>

Armas’s forces quickly got bogged down. One whole group of them surrendered. **The operation looked like it was about to become a disaster. Then all of a sudden Arbenz announced in a special radio announcement that he was resigning and another general was going to take his place as president.** At first the CIA didn’t know what had happened. David Phillips, who was working with Howard Hunt, said, “We expected him to tell his people he had won. We thought we’d lost…‌We were so surprised by his departure.”

**What happened? It was a military coup. Hunt’s radio broadcasts had caused Arbenz to panic. He started to hand out guns to peasants and small farmers thinking that his military was being defeated or that it wouldn’t fight for him. This angered some of his own generals and large landowners. So they forced Arbenz out.**

<…>

*CN*: We almost got to see a farcical recreation of this in Colombia recently. When Petro had to kowtow the moment the Trump administration threatened *visa restrictions*… a lot of generals and large landowners have kids studying in US universities. Lots of them have properties in the US. A lot of them feel like their family members are at risk if they lived in Colombia as an after-effect of the “War on Drugs”… Petro who was already on shaky-grounds given his perceived past sympathies for FARC… was immediately put on the chopping block. Latin America’s traditional elites by-and-large wipe their ass with the notion of national self-determination.

<…>

**The US ambassador to Guatemala negotiated with the new junta to do away with the land program and ensure a friendly government for the United States.** The coup leaders formed a coalition government with Castillo Armas. The CIA sent them a list of fifty or so names that the agency wouldn’t mind seeing eliminated. The names are blacked out of declassified CIA documents, so we can’t tell what happened to them, if anything.

A few weeks later, though, seven people who were working for the United Fruit Company and had been trying to form a labor union, were shot in Guatemala City. **Armas declared that all labor unions were now illegal. A few months after that, he banned all political parties and set up a secret police force. He outlawed books he considered to be “subversive” and declared that anyone opposing him was a communist.**

**The country slipped into civil war.** Over the next three decades, more than 200,000 people died in Guatemala, with the military being responsible for 93 percent of the deaths. Philip Roettinger, a CIA case officer who was on the ground at the time of Operation PB/Success with Armas’s forces, looked back on it with regret. **“The coup I helped to engineer in 1954 inaugurated an unprecedented era of intransigent military rule in Central America,” he wrote, “generals and colonels acted with impunity to wipe out dissent and amass wealth for themselves and their cronies…I am seventy years old now. I have lived and worked in Latin American for more than thirty years. Done with skullduggery, I devote my time to painting the region’s beautiful scenery. It is painful to look on as my Government repeats the mistake in which it engaged me thirty-two years ago.”**

A problem with overthrowing governments is that they give an illusion of control to those in Washington who organize covert operations. But one cannot predict how loyal a dictator will be or what will happen in the future. **There is a human cost that is impossible to calculate and can blow back and cause unforeseen consequences to the United States.** But in the immediate aftermath of the fall of Arbenz, Operation PB/Success seemed to live up perfectly to its name.

Walter Bedell Smith soon left government service to become a director of the United Fruit Company. Allen Dulles probably helped him get this position, because he had been serving for years as a trustee for the company. Few knew this at the time.

The agency needed a win. Dulles gathered the leaders of the operation together to prepare for a victory briefing for President Eisenhower. He got them to first practice in front of him behind his house. When Albert Haney took his turn, Dulles soured. He spent more time talking about his recent experiences in Korea than Guatemala. “Al, I’ve never heard such crap,” Dulles said. He ordered David Phillips to write up a report for Haney to deliver.

The next day, the group brought a slide show for President Eisenhower. Vice President Nixon came, and so did several members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Phillips remembered that Nixon asked the most insightful questions and “demonstrated thorough knowledge of the Guatemalan political situation.” Ike asked how many people died in the operation. Someone answered, saying that Armas lost only one. Ike said, “Incredible!”

It was a lie. A few dozen of his men died in the operation. But Dulles needed a win to trumpet and he couldn’t help but polish it up to make it look as good as possible. President Eisenhower, though, was no fool. He didn’t completely trust Dulles.

**The president received a six-page letter from air force Colonel Jim Kellis, who warned him that Allen Dulles was a “ruthless, ambitious, and utterly incompetent government administrator” who was planting stories in the press to make him look like “a scholarly affable Christian missionary, the country’s outstanding intelligence expert.” It was a facade.** Colonel Kellis had served in the OSS in Greece and then had been sent by Walter Bedell Smith to check out the agency’s operations in Europe and Asia. He found disasters everywhere and claimed that “today the CIA has hardly any worthwhile operations behind the Iron Curtain. In their briefings they present a rosy picture to outsiders but the awful truth remains under the TOP SECRET label of the agency.” He quit the CIA and felt like he had to tell the president what was happening.

Eisenhower appointed World War II bomber hero Jimmy Doolittle and William Pawley, a millionaire businessman who had given the CIA supplies for its Guatemala operation, to investigate the CIA and report back to him. They talked to Walter Bedell Smith, who told them that Allen Dulles “was too emotional to be in this critical spot.” **The two found that the agency had “ballooned out into a vast and sprawling organization manned by a large number of people, some of whom were of doubtful competence.” Wisner had surrounded himself with people “having little or no training for their jobs” and was running operations that not even Allen Dulles knew about or even bothered to supervise**.

The president soon received another report even more devastating due to the people who wrote it. This one had been put together by David Bruce, who was a personal friend of Frank Wisner and Allen Dulles and had served as William Donovan’s personal assistant during World War II, had been Truman’s ambassador to France, and had been a candidate for director of the CIA himself in 1950. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Lovett and former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Richard Connolly also coauthored the report.

According to the trio, “the supporters of the 1948 decision to launch this government on a positive psychological warfare and paramilitary program could not possibly have foreseen the ramifications of the operations which have resulted from it. No one, other than those in the CIA immediately concerned with their day to day operation, has any detailed knowledge of what is going on.”

**They worried that with the rationalization of fighting the Cold War “almost any psychological warfare and paramilitary action can be and is being justified.” The problem is operations are being created and approved at what can “at best be described as pro forma.”** A situation has arisen in which “operations (often growing out of the increased mingling in the internal affairs of other nations of bright, highly graded young men who must be doing something all the time to justify their reason for being) today are being conducted on a world-wide basis by a horde of CIA representatives many of whom, by the very nature of the personnel situation are politically immature. Out of their dealings with shifty, changing characters, their applications of themes suggested from headquarters or developed by them in the field—‌sometimes at the suggestions of local—‌opportunists—‌strange things are apt to, and do develop.”

**“The CIA, busy, monied, and privileged, likes its ‘kingmaking’ responsibility. The intrigue is fascinating—‌considerable self-satisfaction, sometimes with applause, derives from ‘successes’—‌no charge is made for ‘failures’—‌and the whole business is very much simpler than collective covert intelligence on the USSR through the usual CIA methods,” their report said. It was indeed a “great game.”**

**A follow-up report warned that covert operations are multiplying on “an autonomous and freewheeling basis in highly critical areas involving the conduct of foreign relations” and “in some quarters this leads to situations which are almost unbelievable.” The CIA had become a bureaucratic disaster.**

President Eisenhower made some moves to take control of the CIA as a result of this report and other misgivings he had. He created a special committee, called the 5412 Group, to report directly to the president and oversee CIA operations. On the committee were representatives of the State Department, Defense Department, his national security adviser, the vice president, and Allen Dulles. The committee’s purpose was to give approval to all future CIA operations and analyze the job it was doing every six months and report back to Eisenhower.

It didn’t quite work. Allen Dulles did start to consult more closely with the president, but neither did he nor the CIA inform the committee of all of its operations. The director’s sister explained to a friend that “there are some things he doesn’t tell the President. It is better that he doesn’t know.”

President Eisenhower thought about firing Dulles, but didn’t. “At that point, he decided it would be better to have Dulles stay, and keep the pressure on him,” one of his aides remembers. Dick Lehman, a CIA analyst, said of his former boss, “He was, by that time, a tired old man” who “could be, and usually was, trying in the extreme.”

At President Eisenhower’s last National Security Council meeting, Dulles said that over the past eight years at CIA “a great deal has been accomplished” and argued that without his leadership the entire intelligence community would be “a body floating in thin air.” After he heard this, the president exploded in anger, saying that “the structure of our intelligence organization is faulty” and has been ever since Pearl Harbor. “I have suffered an eight-year defeat on this,” and am leaving my successor a “legacy of ashes,” Ike said.

The problem wasn’t simply Allen Dulles. The whole logic of total global Cold War led to an attempt at imperial world order through continuous covert operations. It was crazy, because it was impossible. The United States didn’t have the ability then nor now to have a firm grip on every country in the world. It can’t stop societies from changing and evolving. **Bureaucratic logic meant the CIA kept looking for more reasons for more operations. It was its reason for being. It meant more madness. But Dulles and like-minded people saw it as a great game in which they could be global puppet masters. They loved power, but they were fools.** Allen Dulles and the CIA were creatures of the war state.

When Eisenhower ran for president, a large faction of conservatives in the Republican Party questioned the logic of the Cold War. You probably have never heard of them, because few know of these men today, but their forgotten arguments provide a very important legacy for us even though they lost out. By the end of his presidency, Eisenhower himself began to worry not just about the CIA, but about the entire military-industrial complex and what it meant for the future of the country. The war state was hurling the nation toward what would be a total disaster.",1,1753180190.0,u_MirkWorks,0,1.0,False

literieChapter 1

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

“No, it’s not–”

“How dare you?” Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. “Throw her in the dungeons!” he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn’t even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons—a dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”

# Chapter 3

Auren POV

As Reya dragged me out of the dungeons, my heart drummed against my ribcage out of pure fear. I couldn’t even think of marrying Alpha Lucien, not just because he was cursed, but also because Alpha Bram was my mate. The idea was abhorrent. It was better to die than to marry Alpha Lucien.

Summoning up whatever little energy I had left in me, I pulled my hand out of Reya’s and thought of running towards the forest that surrounded our pack. Once I got away from here, I was sure I would find help.

But the truth was cruel. I stood up, and the next second, my legs felt weak and my body collapsed. With a loud “bump”, I fell to the ground, so did my hope. The dust stung my lungs, my tears welling up in an instant. “No–” I struggled.

“Ha, you think you can escape?” Reya caught my neck with great force, turning my face to her. I couldn’t see her face clearly, but I assumed an evil smile there. “Get her.” She ordered before throwing me to the ground.

Two warriors jumped right in front of me. My eyes widened in horror. “Please leave me alone!” I begged them. “Let me live.”

As if my words irritated her, Reya came into my line of vision again. She directly charged at me and tackled me to the ground. She punched my side and I heard a crack. It meant that one of my ribs had fractured. A scream ripped out of my throat as my body turned numb in pain. “Live? You are so pathetic. Pick her up!” she ordered the warriors. One of them hauled me over his shoulder with no mercy to my fractured rib. As I screamed and cried and begged them to leave me, they carried me all the way to a little room in the omegas’ quarters and slammed the door shut behind them.

I pounded on the door, shouting, coughing blood. “Please leave me. Please.” But no one listened. Eventually, I slipped down on the floor with blood-stained clothes.

I don’t know how many hours went by when I heard the door creak open. I lifted my head only to see the pack's healer. “Luna Maris has sent me to you. Drink this draft,” he ordered. “It will reduce your pain.”

“C—can I talk to her?” I asked.

He clenched his jaw and without replying to me, forced me to have the draft and left, locking the door behind him.

I felt so weak and helpless that I sat against the wall as fresh tears sprang from my eyes. “This is not justified, goddess,” I said aloud. “It is not my fault that you bestowed Alpha Bram as my mate.” Alpha Lucien was the most ruthless Alpha in the north. “What have you written for me in this life?”

The door opened again and this time Alpha Bram walked in. He narrowed his eyes at me and scrunched his face. Shaking his head, he said, “How could the moon goddess bestow you as my mate? There must have been some mistake. You are so pathetic!”

With my eyes wide open, I stared at him with rage simmering in my chest. Feeling horrible under his gaze, I retorted, “I am not pathetic. You are pathetic! You are rejecting your moon-mate.”

He let out a growl and in a flash of a second, he grabbed my throat with his large hands. “Auren!” he shouted. “How dare you say that to your Alpha? You had the guts to run away and defy my orders.”

I started sputtering and coughing as he squeezed my airway.

“Bram!” Maris entered the room and shouted at him. “Don’t do that. Tomorrow she is going forever!”

Alpha Bram shoved me away and got up, still growling. And then came out the poisoned words,

“I, Alpha Bram Reed of the Crimson Howl Pack, reject you, Auren Cressida as my mate.”

“Noooo!” I shrieked as sharp pain stabbed my stomach and heart. My vision blurred and I doubled over, unable to move. Through my blurry vision, I saw Alpha Bram and Maris glaring at me coldly. Maris smirked and holding his hand, she walked out of the room, locking the door behind me.

“I will send Reya to dress her up tomorrow,” I heard her voice before I fainted.

When I woke up next, I felt numbness in my body. Seina had howled and whimpered all night and eventually rolled up in a ball and tucked away somewhere, where I couldn’t reach her. She was more hurt than I was.

Morning light was filtering in my room. It was a morning of doom. I didn’t have the strength to get up and do anything. I had lost my appetite. When the door opened again, I saw Reya entering with a box in her hand, followed by a maid.

She chuckled. “What a wretched bitch!” She pulled me up roughly. “Luna Maris has sent me to dress you up. But first you need a bath. You stink like a rotten critter.”

She dragged me to the bathroom where she opened a cold water shower. I shivered under it uncontrollably, but she was least bothered. When I came out, she threw a dress at me. “Wear this. Alpha Lucien will be here in an hour.”

I gaped at her with horror. Alpha Lucien was coming so fast?

The dress loosely hung over my shoulders. From the smell of it, I knew it was Maris’s old one.

Reya’s face lit up with a shrewd grin. “Congratulations, Auren. You are getting married to the most unwanted Alpha in the north. Consider yourself lucky that you will live another year while serving as his breeder.”

Chills ran down my body at the way she said it to me, and my knees felt wobbly. I walked shakily behind her until I reached the main hall.

The place was buzzing with activity. All the omegas were preparing for Alpha Lucien’s arrival. Maris was giving orders to them and as soon as she saw me, she sniggered. She jerked her chin to Reya who nodded and took me to a corner of the room. My eyes went to Alpha Bram who was talking to some people. Why was it that the rejection affected me and not him? Did his wolf not feel the pain? Tears came into my eyes again, but this time I refused to let them out because I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me broken and shattered.

A few minutes later, he went out and when he returned, he was with Alpha Lucien. The most terrifyingly beautiful wolf I’d ever seen.

Towering at over six feet, his broad shoulders and chiseled physique radiated raw power. Midnight-black hair framed a cold, sharp, angular face, with dark eyes that seemed to pierce your soul.

No decisions, no waiting for complicated orders, just one tap and go. It’s fast, affordable, and totally focused.

# 🔧 How It Works:

* **One product**: You get a hot, high-quality black coffee. That’s it. No variations.
* **Self-service table**: Milk (dairy & alt), sugar, syrups, cinnamon, etc., all available at the DIY counter. Customize it yourself.
* **Flat pricing**: One simple, cheap price, say, $1 a cup.
* **Speed-focused**: Baristas only pour coffee. No faff. Think McDonald’s efficiency meets barista-quality beans.

# 🧱 Brand & Atmosphere:

* **Name**: *Black Coffee* (clear, memorable, tongue-in-cheek)
* **Logo**: Bold black & white branding. Possibly a coffee cup silhouette or the word “BLACK.” in a clean BIG modern font.
* **Design**: Industrial, clean, minimal. Black and white with sharp signage. Like a tech startup and a dive café had a baby.
* **Tone of voice**: Witty, dry humor. Think signage that says: “Don’t ask for oat milk. It’s at the table.”

# 🛠 Operational Benefits:

* **Speed**: No order complexity = fast throughput.
* **Cost-effective**: Only need one kind of coffee bean + minimal training.
* **Low waste**: One product, minimal packaging, predictable inventory.

1m6ag4v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m6ag4v,The Onion - Honda Ramps Up Ridgeline Production in Alabama: Blame Reddit,"**LINCOLN, AL – July 22, 2025** – In an unprecedented move that has left industry analysts scratching their heads and local residents mildly confused, Honda Manufacturing of Alabama (HMA) announced today a massive, unprovoked increase in Honda Ridgeline production. Sources within the plant, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of being forced to wear ""Rule Number 1"" t-shirts, confirmed the decision was driven not by market demand, but by a particularly heated debate on Reddit.

""It started innocently enough,"" muttered a visibly sleep-deprived foreman, nursing a lukewarm coffee. ""Just a few Redditors arguing about whether the Ridgeline subreddit is cool or not. Next thing you know, the executive suite gets wind of it, and suddenly we're on a three-shift schedule, stamping out Ridgelines for Rule Number 1 picture posts – which, frankly, some of those Redditors insist is really lame.""

The online spat, which reportedly sparked in the Honda Ridgeline subreddit r/hondaridgeline , continued on r/cars, even a surprising spinoff thread on r/gardening (something about a NART hauling mulch, apparently), saw users vehemently defending or denouncing the Ridgeline subreddit's Rule Number 1, as well as the use of ""NART."" Upvotes and Downvotes flew, Rule 1 posts were forged in the fires of digital passion, and at one point, a user claimed to have personally seen a mass of Ridgelines gathering for ""the biggest Rule 1 post ever"".

Honda executives, initially dismissing the online fracas as ""background noise from the internet machine,"" reportedly became increasingly agitated as the argument gained traction. ""Our brand image was at stake!"" exclaimed a Honda spokesperson, who then immediately corrected herself, ""Our *truck-adjacent lifestyle vehicle* brand image was at stake! We simply could not allow such blatant Rule Number 1 hatred to proliferate without a decisive response.""

That response, apparently, was to flood the market with more Ridgelines than ever before. ""We figure if there are enough Ridgelines out there, people will just *have* to acknowledge the validity of Rule 1,"" explained the spokesperson, nervously adjusting her ""NART"" lapel pin. ""And maybe, just maybe, one of those internet trolls will accidentally post a Rule 1, and realize the fun behind using 'NART'.""

The Lincoln, Alabama plant, which is the sole global source for the Ridgeline, is now operating at a fever pitch. New hires are being fast-tracked through training, and the hum of robotic arms assembling tailgate after tailgate has become the town's new, slightly baffling, anthem. Local businesses, particularly those selling tire shine and small, tasteful bed liners, are reporting a boom.

However, not everyone is convinced by Honda's Reddit-fueled production strategy. ""It's like they're trying to drown out the noise with more noise,"" observed automotive analyst Brenda ""The Oracle"" O'Malley. ""While Rule 1 has a loyal fanbase, its niche appeal hasn't traditionally warranted this kind of volume. This feels less like a calculated business decision and more like a very expensive 'prove you wrong' argument.""

Meanwhile, back on Reddit, users are already reacting to the news. One user, u/UnibodyKing4Ever, posted: ""See? I told you! Honda knows what's up! Rule 1 reigns supreme!"" Another, u/BodyOnFrameTillIDie, countered: ""They're just trying to pawn off their inventory before the inevitable collapse of 'Rule 1' pictures and 'NART' post market. Wake up, sheeple!""

As the debate rages on and the Honda Ridgeline factory churns out vehicles at an unprecedented rate, one thing is clear: the internet has a strange and powerful influence, even on multi-billion dollar corporations. And somewhere in Alabama, a lot of very tired factory workers are building trucks, all because a few anonymous people couldn't agree on if Rule 1 is cool or not.",34,1753179973.0,hondaridgeline,9,0.78,False
