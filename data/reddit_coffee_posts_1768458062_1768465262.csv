I was laid off five months ago and I’ve been actively applying for new roles, but I still haven’t been able to secure a job. My savings are now exhausted.

I was planning to borrow money from my mother back in Iran, but due to current restrictions and communication issues, there is no reliable way for her to send me funds anymore.

I’m not asking for charity — just short-term support so I can stay afloat while I keep applying, building projects, and creating.

I was off work for over 2 weeks over Christmas and I only had two cups of coffee over the whole period. When I returned to work, I noticed that drinking coffee is giving me really extreme anxiety: shaking, heart racing, etc. I cut down to only two cups per day, one when I arrive at work and one mid-morning, but it's still too much, even though I also drink lots of water, around 3 liters per day which I would have thought would mitigate the problem. I live in the Netherlands and coffee is quite strong (although also very small).

 “you are wrong + I know better + you don’t know what you are doing\* you must: define your niche + alignment + routing client method and “dm me” + compliment= success

I answer, nice polite and optimistic although saying no and re-asking the essence of my question, and again same thing…

I get using social media to sell a service, of course, that’s totally fine, but I really didn’t like this approach, here is my pre-coffee answer to them this morning 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️.

To anyone looking to do the same: using someone’s post as an opportunity to sell your service is really fine in my book, but please do it with care and considering the actual question that person is asking, then it’s a win-win… and you might have even helped someone in the process!

1qddss7,https://i.redd.it/u4qh5eag0hdg1.jpeg,"Travel set reviews (Akro, Penhaligon’s, Acqua di Parma, Atkinsons)","I love a multi pack of travel sprays. Wish more brands did these. Here are some reviews on a few and if you know of any good travel packs (not discovery packs, full travel size) please let me know! 

ACQUA DI PARMA (these are 12ml so a little more generous than usual)

*Fico di Amalfi* (fig nectar, lemon, pink pepper). This is a really jammy fig nectar - not the usual green fig leaf type of scent. Really tasty, but very close to the skin, almost no projection, and wears off pretty quickly. Very quiet compared to the other two. But damn the fig in this is delectable 

*Arancia di Capri* (orange, mandarin, caramel). The orange is very ripe and the caramel is prominent. Despite this it manages to be very fresh. A really unique scent!

*Mirto di Panarea* (myrtle, lemon, juniper). This was my surprise favourite out of the three - the myrtle really makes this. Fresh, zingy, herbaceous. Like the fresh moist face towels this give post sauna at an expensive day spa.


ATKINSONS (note: these travel bottles are some of the best quality I have seen - thick sturdy glass, a really nice atomiser, heavy lids that won’t deform)

*The Big Bad Cedar* (cardamom, broom, cedar). Woody woody woody. Sharp and a touch spicy, almost has a bit of liquorice feel to it. If you like the dry wood smell of cedar, this is worth trying. 

*Mint & Tonic* (mint, lime, ginger). This reminds me a bit of Bohemian Lime by Goldfield & Banks. VERY limey, both the juice and the zest. The mint is the peppermint kind, not the spearmint kind (spearmint gives me a toothpaste vibe every time). 

*Pirates’ Grand Reserve* (rum, cocoa, heliotrope). I love a boozy scent and this don’t disappoint. The heliotrope lends a powdery quality to it, the cocoa adds a slight bitterness, and the rum is deep dark and sweet. Absolutely love this 

*Scilly Neroli* (petitgrain, neroli, patchouli). I’m not a neroli / orange blossom fan, so I thought this one would be a giveaway. However it manages to overcome this as petitgrain is the dominant note to my nose. Nothing to write home about but a perfectly serviceable freshie 

AKRO

*Awake* - this is the most realistic freshly pulled espresso I have smelled. My husband asked if I spilled coffee on myself. I really love this. Lemon note on opening fades away fast and you’re left with a dark roast coffee.

*Bake* - soft lemon and butter tart. Sits very close to the skin and has poor longevity but man it’s such a nice scent for the fleeting time it is with you for. Comes third in the lemon gourmand olympics for me (Chelsea Morning by Lush = gold, Nishane Ani = silver, Lira scraping in 4th place)  

*Rise* - I do get a slight sunscreen smell from this. The pineapple smells quite realistic - not that ripe, like you’ve just twisted the stem off a pineapple and realised you were too hasty because it really needs a few more days to ripen up.  

PENHALIGON’S - (note, i’m annoyed these travel sizes don’t unscrew - I got these hoping to refill The Favourite and Empressa when they’re empty from full bottles I have of each. However I was delighted to find they come with quality travel pouches - tight elastic at the neck so they don’t slide off easily, with Penhaligon’s signature bow.)

*Luna* (bitter orange, juniper, rose, jasmine) - opens up with a very punchy juniper note, settles into a citrus floral. Citrus is zesty, the rind not the juice, smells like a very aromatic gin and tonic. 

*Empressa* (bergamot, peach, rose, dewberry, patchouli) - this is such a fantastic modern chypre and it’s hard to just reduce it to a few notes, there is a lot going on here. It’s citrusy, it’s fruity yet in a mature way, it’s floral, it’s earthy. It reminds me a bit of Chloe Nomade. 

*The Favourite* (violet, iris, mimosa) - there is just something about The Favourite that tickles me. It’s powdery, musky, floral and clean, and makes me feel like a helpless princess trapped in a tower. 

PENHALIGON’S (again)

*The Cut* (basil, peppermint, fir balsalm) - this is a classic fougere, but sweeter than I expected so it isn’t aggressively masculine. Fresh, herbal, a bit balsamic.

*Sartorial* (honey, ginger, beeswax, lavender) - WOW I adore this. No citrus note is listed but I get a strong lemon from this. To my nose, this is Naxos reimagined for summer. If you like Naxos by Xerjoff this is absolutely worth checking out. Full bottle worthy for me. Quite strong for an EDT by Penhaligon’s too, which are usually on the quieter side ",2,1768464348.0,FragranceStories,2,1.0,False

He’s never been to the States before, so he’s super excited. We were on a call last night going over his plans for his week in Los Angeles.

He casually says: ""I was thinking on Tuesday, we grab coffee, drive over to the Grand Canyon for a hike, and then head back to West Hollywood for dinner.""

I didn't have the heart to tell him immediately. I just pulled up Google Maps and shared my screen.

I had to explain that the ""quick drive"" he wanted to do is actually a 16-hour round trip. I told him, ""Mate, that is basically driving from London to Berlin just to see a hole in the ground and turn around.""

He went quiet for a solid minute and just said, ""Oh. The movies make it look so close.""

We had a good laugh about it, and now we are going to In-N-Out instead.

I’m a coach and psychosocial therapist. After years of corporate success, I hit a severe burnout that forced me to confront long-standing depression and addiction (alcohol and cocaine). Recovery didn’t start with “fixing myself” — it started when I learned to feel again.

Now I’m combining my professional background (psychology) and lived experience to start a free men’s group in Haarlem, focused on emotional literacy, genuine connection, and critically examining the pressures placed on men.

**What is this group about?**

This is a safe, non-judgmental space for men (16+) who want to:

*• Emotional Literacy*

Many of us were never taught how to recognize, feel, regulate, or express emotions in a healthy way. We work on expanding emotional awareness beyond anger, numbness, or stress — and learning how to stay present with what’s actually happening inside.

*• Real Connection*

A space without bravado, fixing, or competition. Just men listening to men, speaking honestly, and being witnessed without masks.

• *Deconstructing Patriarchy & Harmful Masculinity Norms*

We openly examine how patriarchal expectations shape men’s lives — productivity = worth, emotional suppression, dominance, self-reliance at all costs, fear of vulnerability. This isn’t about blame — it’s about understanding the system and freeing ourselves from it.

*• Self-Discovery*

Who are you underneath your role, performance, or survival strategies?

💡 Intergenerational by design

Open to men aged 16 and up. Younger and older men bring different experiences, and that exchange is powerful.

**Core Values / Ground Rules**

• Non-judgment

• Active listening (no fixing, no interrupting)

• Mutual respect

Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or discrimination of any kind are not tolerated.

**Practical Info**

Cost: Completely free (coffee/tea included)

His mom doesn’t answer—she’s too busy with his little sister, who is running around with shoes on her hands and underwear over her head, pigtails streaming out the leg holes.

Tomorrow is moving day. His family decided they needed a change of scenery. Some strange things had been happening in their town, but they seemed to be the only ones who noticed. When they found new house listings in what seemed like a perfectly normal neighborhood, they jumped at the chance.

He carries all the boxes downstairs. His mom thanks him as she scoops up his sister.

“What time do we leave tomorrow?” he asks while putting his sister’s shoes back in the closet.

“Around nine,” his mom replies. “It’s a seven-hour drive from here… but possibly longer. You know Dad and his tourist attractions.” She chuckles lightly.

“What did you say about tourist attractions?” his dad asks, practically bouncing down the stairs. “Actually, I found this one about a giant peanut! There’s a shop with thirty different flavored peanuts, including ranch and pickle.” His voice is full of genuine excitement.

“I mean… it sounds absolutely superb, Dad, but this giant peanut thing… isn’t it kind of sketchy? I betcha it’s a scam,” he says, raising his eyebrows to make a concerned face, trying to steer his dad off course so they can get to their new house sooner.

“How about a vote?” his mom suggests as she puts his sister down.

“If we go tomorrow, I’ll buy you a T-shirt,” he offers, hoping it’s enough to convince him. “You too,” he adds, pointing to his wife, who gives him a skeptical look.

Before she can reply, their daughter whispers very loudly in his ear, “If we get ice cream, I’ll vote for Peanut Man.”

“Okay, maybe a T-shirt isn’t so bad, and ice cream,” he thought to himself, “and maybe it’ll help break up the car ride,” taking back his initial thought of wanting to get there quickly.

…

The next morning is absolute chaos. His sister has managed to tear open the entire box of Lucky Charms, scattering them everywhere—even in her hair. His dad and he start to pick up the pieces, while his mom does a last check around the house, making sure they’ve got it all packed.

The car is packed with the essentials, while everything else is being driven in the moving truck. Everyone seems to settle down; there’s a mix of excitement and uncertainty as they leave town. His sister chants, “Mr. Peanut, Mr. Peanut!!” every time they come to a stop, which makes his dad chuckle.

The car hummed as they passed through mountains with beautiful views, lakes with clear waters, and many, many trees. His sister sang the jingle she made about Mr. Peanut, each verse more ridiculous than the last.

He tried to tune it out by blasting his music but kept hearing weird noises in it. He brushed it off, but definitely kept an eye on it.

After about three hours of “Are we there yet?” and many renditions of the “Amazing Mr. Peanut” song, they finally arrived at the giant peanut. It was a huge statue of a peanut—obviously—with thin legs, a top hat, and oddly short arms. It had an eerily wide smile, and its eyes were clearly painted on, but had an uneasy hue to them.

They got pictures with their T-shirts and ice cream. While they explored, an employee came up to his sister and gave her a crown, declaring her “Peanut Princess.” The employee gave them a tour and chatted up a storm. He was usually so lonely since no one really came around anymore. “Tourist attractions are definitely a lost art,” he sighed.

They finished the tour, and his dad bought some packs of wildly flavored peanuts, which weren’t going to be eaten for decades.

As they continued on the road, he couldn’t shake this feeling. He knew the danger he left in their old town. But he wondered if it was them… maybe a family curse…?

…

As the day went on, the car began to settle. His sister fell asleep instantly, her paper crown tilting sideways on her head, faint ice cream residue smeared on her cheek.

His dad hummed to the radio, while his mom tinkered with the directions, scrolling and following where the GPS was telling her to go, insisting everything was fine. Still, it seemed… wrong. The roads weren’t lining up, curving where there weren’t curves. The time kept changing—hours to minutes, minutes to hours.

“Everything all right?” he asked in a whisper, in hopes of not waking his sister.

“Yeah… I think so,” his mom replied, though her voice was covered in concern, tapping the screen, trying to make it behave.

After another hour of driving, it was now two in the afternoon. He noticed the scenery beginning to repeat itself—that same road sign with the bent corner, plastered with a graffiti tag, the same rusted guardrail. He was certain they’d already passed it.

“Mom, Dad,” he says slowly, “didn’t we—”

“Huh. This looks familiar,” his dad says, trying to keep it light.

His mom stared out the window. “Continue straight for twelve miles,” a robotic voice chirped, making his mom jump.

They drove for what felt like years, though it was really only two more hours than expected.

By the time the sky began to dim, it was nearly six o’clock. His stomach tightened as they got closer to their new neighborhood. He stepped out of the car, feeling an intense amount of relief. People were walking their dogs; he could hear laughter echo from backyards. It was normal.

Whatever they had left behind in their old town stayed there. And whatever waited for them knew exactly how to make it comfortable.

…

Pfft-thwack. Woosh. Pfft-thwack.

“This construction is driving me nuts,” she mumbled as the sun hit her face, squinting, trying to get it to turn down. Another summer morning in Stillridge. No birds sang her awake anymore—the beautiful, blossoming crabapple tree was cut down to make more space for their duplex.

Ever since she was little, the lot next to her home had been empty, save for an abandoned building that housed raccoons and the occasional peculiar coyote. It used to be so closed off, so private. She liked that. No pop music blasting at nine in the morning, no awkwardness while taking the dog out, no imagined judgment for still being in her pajamas at two in the afternoon. Truly, no one was really paying attention—but it was nicer when no one was around.

A little less than halfway through the school year, the construction company announced plans to turn that lot into duplexes and townhouses. She wasn’t thrilled. Having nice neighbors on one side was great; getting new ones was the problem.

All throughout the summer, they woke her up at seven in the morning, excavators scraping against the rocks and squealing so much they were practically begging for oil, only to take a break around nine. “Why not start later?” she thought to herself. The noises dragged on into summertime, with some breaks depending on their schedule. It wasn’t until the very end of summer they finally finished and furnished two duplexes.

Open houses were hosted in hopes of getting these “beautiful” houses some attention. She later found out they needed to sell them before they could continue building, or else they would have to wait until they got more money. She honestly didn’t know all the details—she was just repeating what her dad said.

For being in such a small space, the houses were surprisingly roomy, with a very modern feel, but they were also extremely expensive. Many families looked at them but never stuck. Because of that, it seemed like her wish of having an old grammy live there was pretty slim. She had hoped for an older woman—or man, who knows—so they could become best friends, bake cookies, and do many crafts together, and it would be awesome.

No one moved in for a solid three months… until now.

…

She heard car doors shut and the sound of someone stretching, like that grumbly noise you make when you just wake up. She peered out the window in curiosity and saw a man scanning his new house, excited but definitely tired. He had a relieved smile on his face as he looked at his wife, who was holding their little girl, wearing a paper crown—who’d clearly seen better days.

A boy—older, maybe the same age—walked out from behind the car, boxes in hand, following them into the house. He looked over his shoulder, feeling as though he was nervous. About what was unknown to her, but she could suspect…

She noticed his window was right in view of hers. “Food’s ready!” her dad called out. She left the window before he could see her.

…

“So, new neighbors, I see,” she says in a lighthearted tone as she rounds the corner into the kitchen.

Her dad nods. “I’ll greet them tomorrow. Let them settle in first.”

“Mhm,” she says, her mouth full of spaghetti.

…

“Mattresses are coming in a few days,” his dad says. “In the meantime, we’ve got air mattresses. Do you want to settle in your room, or should we have a… family sleepover!!”

“I mean, my plan was to settle in my room, but—” His sister jumps on his back, chanting, “Sleepover! Sleepover!”

He and his mom set up the beds while his dad thinks of food for dinner.

“Where do you think is the best Chinese food?”

“Dad. We just moved here. How would we know?” he says in a mocking tone.

His dad chuckles. “I’ll just ask the neighbors, I guess,” he says nervously.

“Take Tilly, she knows what to say,” his mom says, winking at their daughter.

Knock. Knock.

…

She heard it from the kitchen—soft, polite. Whoever it was didn’t want to be a bother. She glanced at her dad, who was mid-bite, mouth full of spaghetti.

“I’ve got it,” she said with a chuckle, wiping her face on a napkin.

When she opened the door, the man from earlier stood on her porch, shifting his weight like he wasn’t sure what to do with himself. Beside him was the little girl, her crown still crooked as she held onto her dad’s leg and waved with her other hand.

“Hi,” he said, smiling. “Sorry to interrupt. We just moved in next door.”

“No worries,” she said with a warm smile. “Welcome to Stillridge.”

“Thanks,” he said, clearly relieved. “I’m—well, we were wondering if you knew any good Chinese food around here. We’re still getting accustomed.”

Before she could respond, the little girl leaned in and whispered loudly, “We saw a giant peanut!”

Confused, she raised her eyebrow. “A giant peanut?” she said with a chuckle.

The man laughed. “Long story. Apparently it’s a road trip essential now.”

As they laughed, the boy appeared behind his father, holding himself stiffly, taking a gander at their home. His eyes darted behind her, until they settled on her face. Their eyes met—something flickered. Recognition, maybe.

“Hi,” he says with an awkward smile.

The air gets thick between them.

Her dad appears in the doorway, cheerful but a little awkward. “So, Chinese food, huh? There’s a place on Maple. I think it’s called Wok Star. Pretty solid.”

“Perfect,” the man says with a smile. “Thank you.”

As they turn to leave, the little girl waves goodbye and says, “Goodnight!”

“Goodnight,” she says with a smile, the boy looking back, trying not to make it obvious.

Later that night, lying in bed, she caught herself staring at his window. The boy’s light flicked on, then off. For a second, she thought she saw his silhouette hesitate, like he was checking if she was still there.

Stillridge went quiet again. But now it wasn’t so empty.

…

It’s Monday. A week since they moved in. She’s in her first-period class—History. She sits in the last column, closest to the door-side wall, in the middle row. The second bell has just rung; the teacher’s still setting up.

He walks in, scanning the classroom for a spot to sit. She’s not paying attention, trying to get her binder out of her bag, when she hears a faint, “Does anyone sit here?” He’s almost whispering.

“Uh, no. It’s all yours,” still not realizing who he is.

“All right, class, as you see, we have a new student,” their teacher says. “Please make him feel welcome.” There were a couple hellos, and that was that.

She looks up, confused—and then meets his eyes as the realization settles in.

It’s him…

It takes him a second to settle down. He smiles at the class and says hello back. Neither of them reacts. The teacher continues with her usual morning spiel about how her morning wasn’t as good as she hoped, but she knew it would be a good day.

He lowers himself into the chair, propping his bag against the table leg, not trying to draw attention to himself. She can see a paper crown sitting at the top of his bag as he pulls out a notebook and a pencil.

“So,” she whispers, keeping her eyes on the board, writing down the title of today’s lesson. “How’s Stillridge treating you so far?”

He lets out a sigh, but more of a laugh.

“Yeah, it’s not terrible. Definitely different.”

The teacher starts her lesson about early settlements and how people chose their place to live. She lets out a chuckle because the timing is impeccable, catching him glance at her with a smile, letting her know he got the irony of that too.

…

He sits next to her. Only because she’s close to the door—at least that’s what he tells himself.

Throughout the class period, he catches himself glancing at her, playing it off as if he’s scoping out the room. Every so often, he catches her looking back, but she quickly returns to her notes.

Their teacher drones on about trade routes and how they were used during the early settlements. He doesn’t need to pay attention—already knowing most things, having taught himself a lot since his last school didn’t challenge him much—but he keeps pretending to take notes, sneaking glances at her.

She notices him. Just barely catching him. It isn’t obvious, but she’s doing it too—the way he holds himself, shifting awkwardly when they lock eyes.

…

**WHAM.**

Books crashed to the floor, echoing through the whole back of the class. He flinched like anyone would, but after the noise settled, he didn’t. His hands trembled.

His knuckles were white, curled tightly around his pencil. His eyes were fixed on the door, as if something was going to burst through. Not on the scrambling student apologizing for the scare, or the teacher carrying on with her lesson. They were glued to the door.

Leaning closer, she says, “Hey… it’s just noise,” in a hushed tone.

Blinking as if he’s snapping out of a trance, “Yeah, I know,” he says too quickly.

He stays rigid. Frozen.

She watches his eyes dart around the room—not curious, not casual—but planned, almost methodical. Door. Windows. Closet. And back to the door again. Counting exits. Places to hide. Like he’d done this before. Like he knew to prepare.

“You’re safe here.” It comes out with barely a breath. “Does this happen a lot?”

The air thickens. He hesitates.

“…No.” Then, quieter, “Not here.”

A chill crawls over her body.

She glances at the door, then back to his face. He looks at her—really looks at her. Something unspoken has passed between them.

That fear wasn’t about the books.

And whatever it was… she needed to know.

… 

She had trouble sleeping that night. Her mind raced. His words replayed in her head—No… Not here. She stared out her window, gazing at his. Trying to make out if he was still awake.

A faint shadow cast through the glass; his light made the window glow a warm orange. A square cutting up the light. He wrote “Go to sleep.” on a notebook page, slapping it to the window.

She stumbled back, embarrassed he knew she was there, but relieved he spoke to her.

That night they were both restless, unable to sleep, uneasy feelings surrounding their thoughts.

…

History class… again. Both slumped in their chairs, barely focused on taking notes—really just scribbling at this point. He finds himself writing “After school. My house.” sliding the notebook closer to her. She gives him a slight nod. And class carries on.

Eventually the school day ends—definitely taking longer than usual. The questions never left her mind; she prepares how to ask them while dropping her bag off at home and then heading over to his house.

He opens the door, scanning the air behind her. She felt safe… but skeptical—not about him, about the town she grew up in…

His parents were out with his little sister. His mom and him talked about this whole conversation plan last night after she had gotten off work—his mom always understood what he saw, she could feel it too.—She would take his dad and sister out after school, leaving the house empty. Giving him the chance to tell her. He knows she can feel it too. The only way to keep her safe is to tell her.

He leads her to the kitchen, gesturing her to sit on one of the stools—his kitchen was clean, white cabinets and a blue backsplash above the stove. The ‘L’-shaped counter housed a double sink and a coffee machine in the corner. The stools were just on the other side, so she was facing the stove—he poured her a glass of water and set out a bowl of chips. Wanting to lighten the mood.

“Soo,” he says nervously, tapping his fingers on the table. Wondering if he’d made the right decision.

“Okay, so clearly there’s something going on… what is going on?” she says with a slight chuckle. She’s definitely not ready for what he’s about to spill.

“Well…” contemplating if he should really tell her, “I know this is going to sound crazy, but just listen and I’ll answer your questions after…” studying her face, realizing she’s already got a lot of questions.

“And you need to promise me—seriously promise me—not to tell anyone, and I mean anyone.” His tone shifting from anxious to stern.

“Promise,” she says with a concerned look on her face.

He holds out his pinky. “It’s not true unless”—he gestures to his hand, it’s shaking. She shows him a reassuring smile while holding out her pinky in return—her hand shaking almost as much as his.

He starts talking, his voice steady at first; as he goes on, it starts to tremble. “In my old town, there were many… cruel things. It’s hard to explain. You would hear voices in your music, they blended with the melody, they were so real. To some it would sound like static, low whispers. To others, they were… bigger, louder. Telling you things, turning you against the most important people….” He starts picking at his thumbs—it’s getting more difficult to continue—his eyes start swelling with tears.

“Did…” she clears her throat. “Did you turn against someone…?”

“No… not necessarily.” He swallows, hesitating to look into her eyes. “But I watched it happen, time and time again. The friends I grew up with… started changing. Angry. Paranoid. Anxious. The things they’d say, it wasn’t them. It didn’t sound like them anymore.”

She shifts in her seat. Straightening her back. “And the voices…? Did all that?”

He nods. “It’s not just telling you things. They know things. Study you from afar… get into your own head. They learn your fears, who you care about. And they use it against you.”

Silence fills the air. All they hear is the humming of the fridge—which is all too loud in this moment.

“Wait. Why are you telling me this now?” she asks.

His voice trembling more than before. “Because since we moved here…” he hesitates. “I can sense them here again.” He clears his throat. “And I know you—”

CRASH.

…

She wakes up dazed, vision blurry in her left eye, her ears ringing. “Hey, hey, hey,” someone knelt beside her, shaking her shoulder. It’s his mom. She soon realises what happened, a massive hole in the window. Someone—no, something—took him.

“It’s happening again…” her heart pounding as she repeats herself in a more reassured tone.

She hears his mom say something but can’t quite make it out. His mom helps her up, bringing her arm around her shoulder. “It’s not safe for her anymore,” she says to his dad, while he’s hugging his sister—who’s buried in his chest, terrified the thing will come back.

“I’m bringing you home. I’ll explain later,” she says with a stern look on her face.

Her house isn’t far—which doesn’t make it any more safe—but it’s a start. Her dad is still at work and will be for another hour or two. His mom grabs all the bandages she can find, making sure all her cuts are covered—the glass from the window was hit so violently that it shot across the room and cut up her face, and a little hit her arm. From the knowledge the mom has, the monster also whispered something to her—most likely to put her to sleep, trying to make her forget.

His mom waited for her dad to get home; she left before he could see her. The daughter left him a note saying she didn’t feel well and that she was going to sleep. She couldn’t let her dad see her like this—it was for his own safety.

That night, every time she closed her eyes, she couldn’t hear a thing. It would all go quiet. Even her thoughts. Words were slipping away—important ones. Her name. *His* name. The colour of his eyes. It was hard to hold onto them, so she wrote it down. Afraid if she didn’t, he’d disappear for a second time—not only from the world, but in her world too.

…

He wakes up on the floor, it’s damp, unsettling,  he takes a breath that burns his chest. The feeling, the air, it’s familiar but so different. So… wrong.

“No… not again,” he says, gasping for air, trying to reel himself back in. “They can’t forget. I can’t forget.”

The room shifts around him. The floor becomes wood, creaking under him. The walls turn a navy blue. He knows this room. It was hers—except she wasn’t there, nothing was there. Just her window. Panic takes over as he screams her name. Nothing. Not even an echo. His words barely exist, like they never left his mouth.

That’s when it clicks. It’s not meant to keep them, only their memories. Only what’s left of them.

He sits there feeling helpless. Trying to remember how his mom pulled him out last time—what she did, what she said—but the memory slips away as he tries to grasp it. Then, very faint, almost impossible sound.

A pencil scratching on paper.

For a moment he’s stuck; he doesn’t understand. Then it hits him, all at once. The room, she’s here, she’s remembering. His chest tightens, fear and relief flood his system as he tries to breathe again, trying so hard not to cry. As long as she keeps writing, keeps remembering, he won’t vanish.

…

Knock knock.

A soft sound fills her room, as if whoever is there is scared of breaking something. She opens the door—bed head and all. Her hands clutching the latest notebook.

Her dad freezes when he sees her face, the bandages, her eyes puffy from crying.

“Who did this to you?” he asks, his voice so familiar, so real.

“I can’t—” she breaks down, sobbing. She collapses when her dad hugs her, holding her with such security, not asking any more questions. He sees the notebook on her desk, trying to read the frantic writing. Pages are filled with sheer panic, uneven writing, desperate to stay on the page.

…

“She has to remember… someone, please remember.” The scribbling grows quieter, and quieter. He needs to find a way out. Immediately. Panic is starting to submerge his thoughts. He forces himself to breathe, to think past the fear. You can’t stay if you’re fully remembered.

He closes his eyes and clings to the words. Relaying it to himself, over, and over again. He clings to the details he remembers, starting to verbalize what he sees. How he feels when the sunlight hits his window at the perfect time of day. How bored he gets in history class, but realizing he gets to sit next to her, making it more bearable. Family game nights in his old house, how safe it felt when everyone was there. How unsafe he felt when he was alone. He soon realizes he’s yelling, and that the scribbling sounds are back. Way louder than before too.

…

Her hand aches; she starts to write slower, more deliberate. Not so scared of losing him anymore, not knowing why, but feeling right again. Her dad sat outside, wondering what had happened with this little girl. Reminiscing on how she used to be, so bubbly, and humorous. Never backing down from a challenge, remembering the first time she did her hair all by herself. He laughs remembering how awful it looked, but how proud he was because she never cared about what anyone thought.

He repeats his name on the page. It turns into paragraphs of who he is, what he was, who he wants to become. Things she didn’t know. He’s helping her remember.

…

The light shifts, it’s warmer now. Coming from somewhere, a real place he could see it. The floor creaks. He can feel himself again, he’s real—the way his knees ache, how tight his chest really feels, his words travel.

He takes a step forward and…

Thunk. Something hits the floor—something real.

“Are… are you really here?” she says, choking back her sob.

“I think so…” he replies with a chuckle.

“I… I don’t believe you,” with tears streaming down her face.

He realises all the cuts on her face, the bandages covering the major cuts. His face covered in concern, he holds out his pinky. “Promise.” With a stern look on his face, the same way his mom looked.

She breaks down, holds out her pinky and hugs him. So tight his ribs start to hurt, but he doesn’t mind. Just glad to be back home.

Outside they hear a knock at the entrance door and familiar voices filling the house—a sharp sense of relief washes over him again.

Your Active Retirement starts now ✈️ (Seriously, bundling flights & hotels saved us a fortune!)","**You Might Be Richer Than You Think (But Are You Using Your Money Right?)**

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the truth: **Most of us are sitting on way more financial power than we realize—we’re just not using it the right way.**

Think about it:
- That $5 daily coffee? **$1,825 a year.**
- The unused gym membership? **$600+ down the drain.**
- The impulse Amazon buys collecting dust? **Cha-ching.**

Now, what if I told you those ""small"" leaks could be **funding your freedom** instead? No, I’m not saying you need to live on ramen and regret. I’m saying **tiny tweaks = massive payoffs** over time.

### **3 Ways You’re Probably Wasting Money (Without Even Knowing It)**
1. **The ""I’ll Save Later"" Trap**
   - *""I’ll start investing when I make more.""* Newsflash: **Time is your biggest asset.** Even $50/month now could grow into *thousands* thanks to compound interest. (Yes, really.)
   - *Example:* If you’d invested $100/month in the S&P 500 at 25, you’d have **~$200K by 65**. Wait till 35? That drops to **~$100K**. Ouch.

2. **The Invisible Subscriptions**
   - Quick audit: Open your bank app and search ""subscription."" **I bet you’ll find at least 2 you forgot about.**
   - *Pro tip:* Use apps like Rocket Money to cancel the zombies. Redirect that cash to **something that actually grows** (like, say, your future).

3. **The ""Discount"" That Costs You**
   - *""But it was 50% off!""* Cool, but if you didn’t need it, you just spent **100% more than you should have.**
   - *Try this:* Before buying, ask: *""Would I pay full price for this?""* If no, walk away. Your future self will high-five you.

### **The Mindset Shift That Changes Everything**
Here’s the kicker: **Being ""rich"" isn’t about the number in your account—it’s about what that number can *do* for you.**
- Could it buy you **time** (aka early retirement)?
- Could it buy you **options** (quitting a job you hate, starting a biz)?
- Could it buy you **peace** (no more 3 a.m. money panic)?

**You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.** [Check it here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb). *(FYI: That’s an affiliate link—if you sign up, I might earn a little coffee money. No pressure, just sharing the love!)*

### **So… What’s *One* Thing You’ll Do Differently?**
Maybe it’s canceling that one subscription. Maybe it’s automating $50 to investments this week. Or maybe it’s just **pausing before your next ""deal"" purchase.**

Small moves now = **big wins later.** Which one will you start with?

I'm just starting to realize this particular thing for myself.

I've been caffeine-free for up to a year at a time (about 3 years total over the last 7 years) and have seen some benefits, but not as much as I thought I would. Sugar actually seems to be the bigger culprit for me.

I've just started adding green tea back in to self-medicate my ADHD, which has been extra challenging the last month or so, and oh my god, I feel so much more alive and human with it. So far it's not affecting my anxiety, and I think the l-theanine in it helps. (Plus I'm taking an extra l-theanine pill first thing in the morning to help with high cortisol levels, which I had tested when I'd been caffeine-free for about 8 months, so it very likely wasn't caused by that.)

I still think coffee is gross and it makes me sick, even when I get one that's organic and tested for mycotoxins. I don't know what compounds in it affect me so badly, but I feel like it, as well as chocolate to a lesser extent, are on a whole other level, and I have no desire to ever go there again.

But one cup of green tea in the morning just gives me the boost I need to at least sort of function without presciption meds, and I'm realizing that's the best option for me at the moment. It also lessens my sugar cravings, which I think happens because I badly need the dopamine, so that feels like a fair trade off. (I've tried and failed to quit sugar countless times.) Who knows, maybe someday I'll go back to being fully caffeine-free, but for now I'm enjoying being able to function a little better!",1,1768463611.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I love romanticizing road trips, city lights. Usually hindi mo ako makakausap kasi naka-earphones ako. But don't get me wrong, I love having conversations lalo na kapag interested ako sa iyo. I ask a lot of questions pero minsan I just listen din. Depende talaga.

I try to push myself to run every now and then lalo na kapag may iniisip. Helps me clear my mind.

I'm not that maligalig type of person but I guess it depends on the chemistry. I almost forgot the most important thing, I love iced coffee.",2,1768463068.0,singleph,3,1.0,False

Hey “putting myself out there” again. I’m 37 single no kids and in the West USA. Though my soul feels ageless, people always assume I’m much younger than 37…. Guess it’s a millennial thing. I’m actually an 87 year old man…. Jk. I’ll keep it real - I’m attractive, intelligent/nerdy, petite, enfp 8w7, South Asian American, and pretty eccentric. Yeah, we do exist, and it’s been a unique but lonely existence. 

In my free time I like to work out, get in nature, read fantasy series, gorge on coffee, generally just chill and other special interests. I’m obsessed with my cat. I’m sociable and like having a social life but don’t have one right now lol. The few people I’m close to all live far so there’s no one I’m leaving the house to hang with lately which, as an extrovert, is taking its toll believe me. Past and present friends would describe me as funny, warm to be around, thinky, and has an unhinged wild side with 2 sides of that coin. 

I typically work out of obligation, and want to somehow be free enough to choose work I genuinely want to do. Bit of a rant… I really like working, earning, and self efficacy, but I don’t like the mind games in corporate politics because I’m authentic. I’d say I’m ambitious… them brown people values. But my relationship with work and jobs has become complicated and burnt out. I’m craving purposeful work more than ever. I typically work as a recruiter but the market has been garbage so the job hunt is rather grating and hollow. I seek to balance out the the jobless adrenaline that clogs up my throat most mornings. I want to do something creative and have a few ideas but am always snagged down by survival and soul draining jobs and my real life feels far away. 

Anyway, I just want to reach my full potential, am oriented toward good, and have done a lot of work on myself in the process but genuinely don’t care to be perfect. A great partner is always interested in supporting their lover’s truest becoming. 
So my life and stuff isn’t exactly perfect at the moment but I’m still intent to keep growing and learning despite the odds. I’m mainly looking for connection and see where it goes. 

I’m typically a very deep lover in the container of solid relationships, and it takes some time to get there. Right now I’m hoping to have some brighter days, to look forward to waking up, to have my reality seen and visions championed, and to have my level of consciousness matched if not upgraded. A tall order maybe, but a true need. I need to viscerally feel possibilities in this growing darkness of our world. And I believe that our best love life unfolds in the process of pursuing our highest selves. 

I know what I’ve shared isn’t that different, so I know it resonates with many of you. I hope I’ve spread hope here. But please only message if you actually get it and are available. ",1,1768462629.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.67,False

I almost shout, Oh no please, wait!  
the cake is mine! You don't know what's at stake!  
But I say silent and quietly shake,  
and prayer hands at my waist do  make.

sandwiches, for the chef to create.  
  
That leaves one last customer in place,  
In fitness clothes, I know him; Jake.  
But then, thank the lord he gets...  
a shake,  
A shake!  
A shake!  
A chocolate shake!  
What a fantastic choice for Jake to make.  
  
Now's my turn, to stake my claim.  
I'll taste the chocolate cake again.

the display,  
towards the plate,  
that holds the last piece of my cake.    
Maybe they know, what I always
take. 
Espresso coffee, slice of cake.  
  
Is that for me? l ask and quake.  
""No sir, it's not"",  
there must be some mistake!  
Which villain has stolen my cake?  
I turn and do a quick in take,  
of customers, to see the evil snake.  
  
I watch it to the table make,

I'm planning this trip for 7-14 days. With 1-2 days stops in Hua Hin and Phuket. 

Do you have any experience for motorbike trips like that? Any recommendation? 

I have quite a flexible working schedule. I can work 3-4 hours per day or don't work some days. If the place is very similar to all others, I would prefer to just drive more kilometers per day. And have a rest or work. But if it's worth stopping and visiting, I am ready to spend more time in the place.

My friend and I are both gay men living in York. We’ve been trying to branch out and make new connections in the city, but the few existing local groups didn't quite fit what we were looking for.

We’re just wondering if there are other LGBT+ folks, especially people in their 20s/30s, who are a bit nerdy, alternative, and/or introverted and who also haven't found their spot yet who maybe wanted to meet up with us to make some new friendly connections!

We were thinking just a chilled coffee meetup with no pressure or formal club rules. If we all get along, maybe we do it again?

**Tentative plan**

***Where***\*:\* Cityscreen Cafe

***When***\*:\* 19:00 Friday 16^(th) of January (i.e. this Friday)

You'll know it's us because we'll have a fluffy rabbit toy on our table like the one in the attached photo. That's the sign! 

About us: mid-30s sci-fi nerd (Star Trek, Murderbot, Adrian Tchaikovsky) + late-20s cinephile/music lover/gamer (psychological horror, Disco Elysium, Radiohead, Nick Drake, Kate Bush, Talking Heads).

If this sounds like your cup of tea (or coffee!), please drop a comment below so we can get an idea of numbers. If you're interested but feeling shy, feel free to shoot me a DM instead.

Also, if anyone knows about any other LGBT+ groups and spaces in York that you think we might like, we'd be really grateful to hear about them! I’ve already tried York LGBT Forum’s Wednesday coffee socials and the LGBT book club at York Theatre Royal. I’ve also heard about sport groups, but these aren’t really our bag.

Thanks and all the best. :-)

You know that feeling when you tell yourself you're too tired to start that project? I've been there countless times, thinking I need to conserve my energy like it's a battery that'll run out. Turns out, we've all got it backwards. Energy isn't something you save up for the perfect moment. It's something that shows up when you're actually doing something that matters to you.

When you feel drained, it's not because you've used up all your reserves. You're probably just spinning your wheels on stuff that doesn't connect to anything real in your life. That exhaustion you feel scrolling through your phone at night? That's not physical tiredness. That's your brain telling you it's bored and unfulfilled.

The people you know who seem to have endless energy aren't superhuman. They're not chugging five coffees or running on some special diet. They've just figured out how to aim their attention at things they genuinely care about. When you're working toward something meaningful, you don't constantly check how much energy you have left. You just keep going because you want to see what happens next.

So stop asking yourself if you have enough energy today. Start asking what you actually want to make happen. The energy follows the focus, not the other way around.

Mornings start early, but in a good way. People already outside, houses getting cleaned, rangolis popping up everywhere. Kids running around like they’ve had 3 coffees. You step out and something’s always going on - bullock carts passing, elders talking, someone randomly offering food or tea.

No one’s just “attending” Sankranti here. Everyone’s part of it. Farmers, families, kids, grandparents - all of it feels real, not staged. Some have games, some are just busy prepping for the next day. Every day feels a little different but still festive.

One thing I always love is how animals are treated. Cows and buffaloes get bathed, decorated, fed first, worshipped. And it’s not dramatic or ceremonial - they’re treated like family. People talk to them, joke around, take their time. It’s normal here, but when you actually stop and notice it, it feels pretty special.

There’s also this ancestors thing running quietly in the background. Not heavy or emotional, just… present. In the rituals, the stories, the way things are done. Feels like you’re part of something that didn’t start with you.

At the same time, you can’t ignore that things are changing. Every year a few familiar faces aren’t around. People stuck where they are with jobs, responsibilities, life stuff. Some activities don’t happen anymore, or they happen smaller. No big announcement, it just slowly fades.

Still, right now, feels full. Full of noise, colour, food, laughter. It slows you down without forcing you to think about it.

weeks ago, notes of mango and caramel, all that jazz. I always thought of that kind of thing like wine - nobody can even tell that the wine is a “nice wine.”

[$1500],"hi! i'm currently in a place in life where i'm starting to make more money, so a goal of mine in 2026 is to make a point to save enough money for a nice espresso setup and establish a good flow by 2027! considering what i currently have saved, my current and upcoming employment and income, gifts from family, scholarshipss freeing up my personal funds, etc, my low target for my coffee budget is probably going to be around $1500 by this summer, but will hopefully go up as the year goes on! 

i currently do not have any kind of setup, so i'll be starting from scratch. i've planned it out with my mom in our kitchen and i'll have about 2 square feet to work with plus a bit of cabinet storage.

my parents and i prefer milk drinks, and my brother doesn't drink coffee but i do want to be able to make him hot chocolates and steamers, so a solid steaming ability is definitely needed. altogether i think i would be pulling around 3 shots a day on average, give or take me being busy and not having time and making drinks for a couple friends. i'm set up to start student teaching in august, so i don't want to get something i'll have to spend a lot of time tinkering with on a regular basis.

at the moment i've been working since may at a local gelato place that also does coffee, but it's not the main thing we serve. however, my boss currently has us using a la marzocco linea, a really nice grinder, beans from a very high quality roaster in our area, and he's generally pretty meticulous about the quality of his products, so i've had a fairly solid amount of training, but i'm far from expert. i really have been enjoying the process, though!

with my current budget i'm considering the gaggia classic e24, but i'm also willing to wait longer to afford something better! my dream machine is the lelit mara or bianca, but i think those are both aways away both for budget and experience. i'm also open to other recommendations! 

as far as grinders go i'm not sure if i have anything i'm eyeing yet. i do know i want a single dose that doesn't take up a lot of space and would mainly be for espresso.

like i said, i'm starting from scratch, so i'm also looking for recommendations for my setup in general. what are your non-negotiables? what should i avoid? is there something cool/fun i should try out? do you have tips for storage and organization for gear?

👉 CONTINUE READING 👈
Chapter 1
The day we got our wolves, Nick and I slept together one last time.

A breakup fuck.

Afterward, he handed me a cigarette with practiced ease and chuckled.

""My future Luna,"" he said lightly, ""would never be a she-wolf who smokes after sex.""

My throat tightened. I asked him why.

He answered calmly, almost gently.

""Avery, only a pure, flawless she-wolf can stand beside me as my Luna.""

I stayed silent for a long time. Then I cut off all contact with him and left his pack.

When we met again, he had become my new boss.

To avoid awkwardness, I submitted my resignation proactively.

Instead, he cornered me in the CEO's office.

""It's been five years,"" he said, blocking my way. ""How about another round?""

I lowered my gaze.

""No. I need to pick up my child from school.""

The air went still.

Nick froze.

I tried to stand up from his lap, but his grip tightened, pinning me in place.

The heat in his eyes dimmed. A faint crack appeared in his usual calm, controlled expression.

Grinding his teeth, he asked, ""How old is your child?""

I said nothing at first. Then, quietly, ""Three.""

Three.

Not four.

And it had been five years since the night he rejected me.

That child was not his.

Nick clearly understood that.

I tried to stand again. This time, the large hand at my waist did not stop me.

As I reached the door, he spoke again, suspicion creeping into his voice.

""I remember your personnel file says you never sealed a mate bond.""

I paused, steadied myself, and turned back calmly.

""I signed a bond-sealing deal not long ago.""

""Just signed,"" he said slowly, ""and your child is already three?""

I nodded, completely composed.

""Yes. We had the child before mate-bonding.""

He did not respond.

His sharp gaze dropped to the cheap bonding ring on my finger, and he let out a scoffing laugh.

I did not feel embarrassed at all.

I held my hand up openly, almost shoving it in his face.

The moment I sensed his temper flaring, I turned and fled.

That night, back home, I let out a long breath.

Sometimes, lies were the most effective way to deal with unknown trouble.

I had bought the ring yesterday at a small shop.

Cheap and practical.

I figured it was more than enough to erase whatever lingering affection Nick still had for me.

Sure enough, my resignation was approved the very next day.

HR personally came by in the afternoon to inform me that as long as I finished handover within a week, I could leave.

Normally, resignations took a month.

Needing only one week made it obvious whose decision it was.

I nodded and began transferring my workload to the intern.

The new intern, Giselle, was sweet and enthusiastic.

At the very least, while I was training her, I never paid for breakfast or afternoon coffee herself.

As the workday neared its end, Giselle suddenly spoke up shyly.

""Avery, can I leave a bit early tonight? My boyfriend asked me out to dinner.""

I hesitated.

Not because I could not let her go, but because I also needed to leave early to pick up Isabel.

Seeing me silent for too long, she grew anxious, clasping her hands together and showering me with pleas.

I could not help but laugh.

""It's fine. Go ahead.""

She thanked me excitedly and began packing.

""My boyfriend's coming down now.""

I blinked.

""He works here too?""

Giselle smiled mysteriously.

""No, he's actually…""

Before she could finish, a low, familiar voice cut in.

""Ready?""

Chapter 2
My body stiffened for a split second.

If this were a voice I had never heard before, I probably would have looked up out of curiosity.

Unfortunately, this voice had haunted my nightmares for five full years.

On countless nights when sleep only came with medication, his words echoed in my ears over and over again.

""Avery, you're too well-behaved. I'll corrupt you.""

""Avery, learn to smoke. Young she-wolves who smoke look cool. I want to see a different side of you.""

Under that gentle coaxing, I fell.

And I learned how to smoke.

At first, because Nick was the pack's future Alpha, I kept my distance.

But that night at the party, we got recklessly drunk.

Somewhere along the way, we ended up sleeping together. Just friends with benefits.

We never defined our relationship. He simply stayed by my side.

I still remembered one evening clearly.

He had just finished a date with another she-wolf and driven her home. His car was parked outside her house.

One hand held a cigarette, resting lazily by the window, eyes half-closed as if he were dozing.

Ash drifted into the air with the wind.

I stepped outside in a coat to take out the trash and knocked on his car window.

""I saw it,"" I said, hands in my pockets, pretending not to care.

""I think we should end whatever this is.""

I hoped he would agree, because I was exhausted by the endless she-wolves around him.

But I also hoped he would refuse, because I was already in love with him.

At that moment, even the wind seemed to slow, like a movie paused mid-frame.

I waited quietly for his answer.

Nick turned his head toward me and pulled out a cigarette, lifting it to my lips.

His blue eyes were unfathomably deep, dangerously alluring.

Without thinking, I took it between my lips. My damp mouth brushed his fingers, and he did not pull away.

A trace of indulgent amusement appeared on his face.

""So the good girl learned how to be bad,"" he said lightly.

""We're not some casual thing.""

Back then, I was drowning in his gaze.

I did not understand the meaning behind his words.

I only thought he wanted us to become something more.

Until the day we got our wolves.

Until we discovered we were fated mates.

That was the last time we saw each other.

After a night of passion, he handed me a cigarette again.

""My Luna,"" he said, ""will never be a she-wolf who smokes after sex.""

I forced down the sob rising in my throat and asked him why.

Nick smiled. White smoke curled around his fingers as his tone turned unusually serious.

""Avery, my Luna must be a pure, perfect good girl.""

Tears blurred my vision. I forgot how to breathe.

Good girl.

He liked pure, flawless good girls.

Yet once upon a time, he had told me I was too innocent, too well-behaved, that he did not know how to touch me.

Only now did I finally understand what he meant.

Once I was no longer well-behaved, I became something disposable. Something fun.

""Avery?""

I snapped out of my thoughts, my expression returning to calm neutrality.

Giselle spun around excitedly, grabbed her bag, and jogged over. Then she suddenly looked back at me.

""Avery, aren't you also rushing to pick up your daughter Isabel? We can give you a ride.""

I was about to refuse when Nick walked straight over, picked up the bag I had left on my desk, and headed for the parking lot without giving me a chance to object.

The atmosphere inside the car was unnervingly quiet, broken only by Giselle's occasional chatter.

Nick tapped the steering wheel casually, responding to her in a flat tone.

His gaze drifted toward me again and again.

Perhaps sensing my discomfort, Giselle tried to make conversation.

""Avery, when you work late, does your mate usually pick up your child?""

Hearing the word ""mate"" caught me off guard.

I froze for a moment, then shook my head and made something up.

""He works out of town. He's not home much.""

She gave me a knowing look, her eyes drifting pointedly to the ring I'd bought a few days ago.

""Is that your bonding ring? It looks kind of faded.""

Chapter 3
""Like something off a Walmart clearance rack.""

She stuck out her tongue, looking embarrassed.

""Oh, no, that's not what I meant. Don't get me wrong.""

Giselle seemed to realize she had misspoken and turned toward me to apologize.

Still, I caught the trace of disdain hidden in her eyes, along with an inexplicable sense of superiority.

Then again, compared to my nine-dollar canvas tote, her Hermès bag was practically in heaven.

I was just about to speak when a laugh cut me off.

Nick reached out and patted her head, his smile indulgent. ""It's fine. You didn't say anything wrong. There's no need to apologize.""

Then he glanced at me through the rearview mirror, sounding casual yet unmistakably deliberate. ""Poor people care the most about saving face. You're so blunt. Aren't you worried someone at work might make things difficult for you tomorrow?""

The words were directed at Giselle, but every syllable was meant for me.

What sounded like an offhand comment was, in truth, naked favoritism laced with a quiet warning.

I pretended not to hear him and turned to look out the window.

During the three years I had been Nick's bedmate, I had heard variations of that sentence countless times.

Those people said I was not good enough for him. And I agreed.

The gap between Nick and me was too wide.

He was the future Alpha of the Bluemoon Pack, heir to the most powerful and wealthiest group under the Bluemoon Pack's name.

He was not just rich. He stood at the center of power.

And I was nothing more than an ordinary pack member.

A nobody.

From the very beginning, Nick had been clear.

""Avery, you can be my bedmate, but you will never be my Luna.""

I knew. I had always known. I guarded my heart carefully and never crossed the line.

Yet when emotions ran high, I still wavered. I wanted to try just once, to fight for it.

What if it worked?

So, as shifting night drew near, I was the one who asked Nick out.

That day, he came to pick me up early.

The car stopped in a secluded corner of the campus. Soon, the vehicle rocked violently.

My underwear was pushed aside, my body slick with sweat from our tangled heat.

I was forced to turn over, sunlight filtering through the mottled shadows of plane trees outside the window, stabbing into my eyes until I could barely keep them open.

An hour later, Nick lounged back lazily.

His white shirt was slightly damp, a thin sheen of sweat clinging to his forehead.

The window was half open.

Cold air rushed in, scattering the pale mist of his breath.

I looked at him and slowly asked the question that had been weighing on my chest.

""Nick, do you love me?""

More than asking whether he would make me his Luna, I cared about one thing only.

Had he ever loved me?

He looked at me, the usual mockery in his eyes replaced by a rare seriousness.

""We're about to get our wolves.""

In that instant, I understood exactly what he meant.

We were about to get our wolves, about to find our fated mates.

This arrangement had reached its end.

And even if I were his fated mate, he still would not love me.

He rejected me, right after we slept together.

The car stopped in front of the kindergarten. I pushed the door open and stepped out.

Isabel, standing at the entrance holding her teacher's hand, spotted me and waved excitedly.

I hurried over, thanked the teacher, then lowered my head to Isabel.

""I'm sorry, sweetheart. Mommy is late today.""

""Did you wait a long time?""

Isabel tilted her little face up and pointed with her finger.

""Is it because of that Alpha that you're late?""

I froze and followed the direction of her finger.

Nick was standing behind me. I had no idea when he got there.

The roguish ease he usually wore was gone, replaced with a solemn expression.

And a flicker of something else.

Joy?

I stiffened, instinctively tightening my grip on Isabel's hand.

He stepped forward and slowly crouched down in front of her, studying her obedient, adorable face.

Nick's normally cold voice softened. ""How old are you? What's your name?""

I said nothing. I did not stop him.

After three years together, I knew him well enough.

If he did not see it with his own eyes, he would never believe a word I said.

I looked at Isabel gently and gave her small hand a subtle squeeze.

Do not tell the truth.

Lie.

Would she understand my hint?

Chapter 4
Isabel understood immediately.

""My name is Isabella Whitlock. I'm three years old.""

I let out a quiet breath of relief.

Nick stared at the familiar brows and eyes that resembled his own by at least seventy percent.

The joy of a man seeing his child for the first time barely had time to surface before Isabel's words doused it completely.

The words caught in his throat. For a long moment, he could not make a sound.

Isabel had been born prematurely.

I had also been malnourished during my pregnancy, which left her thinner and weaker than other children her age.

Besides, for a child that young, age was not always easy to judge.

After Nick rejected me, I said goodbye to my parents and left the pack alone.

Because a she-wolf rejected by an Alpha had no choice but to leave the pack.

On the train to Frostland, I blocked him on every social platform. He did not try to contact me either.

We were like two intertwined lines.

No matter how tightly they once wrapped around each other, the moment tension set in, they snapped back to their original paths.

For five years in the same town, I was not without fantasies.

I wondered if one day, at a certain corner or crossing, that familiar car might pass by me again.

It never did.

We had always been moving along different tracks, each with our own rhythm and destination.

Even under the same sky, we were worlds apart.

That night, after we got home, Isabel tugged at my clothes, her face full of confusion.

""Mommy, I'm clearly four years old. Why did you make me lie?""

Yes.

Why did I teach my daughter to lie?

Maybe because I did not want to invite trouble.

After settling in town, I discovered I was pregnant.

I had considered terminating the pregnancy.

But when I actually lay on the operating table, I hesitated.

That lingering sense of unwillingness filled my mind. I admitted it. I was not ready to let go.

I thought that even if we could not be together, having a child connected to him by blood might be enough.

So I gave birth to the child alone.

And the moment I truly held that tiny child in my arms, I felt overwhelming relief at my decision.

She was my daughter.

Half of her blood was mine. She belonged to no one else. She deserved to see this world.

…

After putting Isabel to bed, I received a call from the head of Human Resources, informing me that I did not need to come to work the next day.

I frowned. ""Whose decision was this?""

The other end hesitated and clearly had no intention of answering.

I did not press further. A day earlier or later made no difference to me.

After leaving my job, I did not look for another one.

Instead, I opened a children's clothing studio, with Isabel eagerly volunteering as my model.

With Isabel's adorable looks and the editing skills I had painstakingly taught myself, we gradually built a small following.

Between scattered custom orders and the occasional advertisement, making a living was not a problem. I even managed to save a little.

I thought quitting my job meant distancing myself from Nick once again.

Then there was a sudden, urgent knock on the door.

I opened it to find Nick standing outside, his face dark with anger.

He held up a document labeled Paternity Test and said, ""Explain.""

I tried to close the door, but he shoved it open and forced his way inside.

The already cramped living room, cluttered with belongings, felt even tighter with his presence.

I poured myself a glass of water, my gaze calm.

""Explain what?""

""How I got pregnant? Why I gave birth to Isabel? Or why I lied to you and said she wasn't yours?""",1,1768461722.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Mornings start early, but in a good way. People already outside, houses getting cleaned, rangolis popping up everywhere. Kids running around like they’ve had 3 coffees. You step out and something’s always going on - bullock carts passing, elders talking, someone randomly offering food or tea.

No one’s just “attending” Sankranti here. Everyone’s part of it. Farmers, families, kids, grandparents - all of it feels real, not staged. Some have games, some are just busy prepping for the next day. Every day feels a little different but still festive.

One thing I always love is how animals are treated. Cows and buffaloes get bathed, decorated, fed first, worshipped. And it’s not dramatic or ceremonial - they’re treated like family. People talk to them, joke around, take their time. It’s normal here, but when you actually stop and notice it, it feels pretty special.

There’s also this ancestors thing running quietly in the background. Not heavy or emotional, just… present. In the rituals, the stories, the way things are done. Feels like you’re part of something that didn’t start with you.

At the same time, you can’t ignore that things are changing. Every year a few familiar faces aren’t around. People stuck where they are with jobs, responsibilities, life stuff. Some activities don’t happen anymore, or they happen smaller. No big announcement, it just slowly fades.

Still, right now, feels full. Full of noise, colour, food, laughter. It slows you down without forcing you to think about it.

Not sure if we’re forgetting all this or just letting it slip quietly.
But yeah… Sankranti in the village always hits.

1 month after the breakup he texted apologizing saying he was open to meeting up and talking. And potentially couples therapy. But then I talked to him a few weeks after and he very bluntly said he has no feelings for me but he’s open to being friends.

I feel like I’ve been led on thinking we could reconcile only for him to ask for friendship. I said I can’t deal with this behaviour and I don’t want to be friends because I still love him. I told him if he wanted to go for coffee I wouldn’t go until he went to therapy. And he said “it might be a while”. Whatever that means. He keeps claiming he needs to see a therapist becuase he realizes the way he broke up with me was horribly traumatizing to me. However it’s clearly not a priority for him to go.

I’m just wondering whether exes often regret their decision. This is my first relationship and it was so long that I’m grasping onto hope because I love him. Was going full no contact the right move?

Let me be completely honest. I started watching *Only Murders in the Building* because of Selena Gomez. That’s it. I saw her name attached and figured I’d give it a shot. What I got was so much more than I bargained for.

This show became one of those rare finds that combines everything I love: true crime obsession, genuine mystery, and characters so well-developed that I actually care when bad shit happens to them.

Five seasons in, I’m still hooked.

# What Makes Only Murders in the Building Work



[***Only Murders in the Building*** ](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/only-murders-in-the-building-bridging-boomers-and-millennials-with-a-sensible-whodunnit)follows three neighbors in a fancy New York apartment building called the Arconia who bond over their shared love of true crime podcasts. When a [**murder**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/murder-mindfully-netflix-series-review) happens in their building, they decide to start their own podcast investigating it.

Simple concept, but the execution is chef’s kiss.

https://preview.redd.it/w5yuloo8pgdg1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=44ac015f7dcce54e1a2f51ec6fef3239e3a511f5

Steve Martin plays Charles, a former TV detective actor who’s basically a lonely hermit. Martin Short is Oliver, an over-the-top, failed theater director who’s desperately trying to recapture past glory.

And Selena Gomez plays Mabel, a young artist who keeps to herself and has her own mysterious past.

These three should NOT work together. The age gap alone is ridiculous. But somehow their dynamic is absolute magic. The banter, the friendship that develops, the way they complement each other - it all clicks perfectly.



# The Characters Are Everything



Every single character in this show is so well thought out and fleshed out that it’s impossible not to feel for them. Even the side characters who show up for one episode have depth and personality.

Charles starts as this closed-off, sad guy who can’t connect with anyone, and watching him slowly open up over five seasons has been genuinely moving.

Oliver is initially annoying as hell with his theatrical dramatics, but you come to understand why he acts that way. Mabel seems like a typical Gen Z cool girl at first, but she’s carrying real trauma that affects everything she does.

https://preview.redd.it/vd84f7lbpgdg1.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=33a8344556c2e4e9c0dc71c7e824cb0ad62a20fd

The supporting cast is equally incredible. Jane Lynch as Sazz (Charles’s stunt double) brought so much warmth. Nathan Lane showed up and absolutely killed it. The podcast superfans who follow the trio around are hilariously accurate.

Even the building residents feel like real people with their own lives happening off-screen.

# The Mystery Element Hits Different



As someone who’s obsessed with true crime, this show scratches that itch perfectly.

Each season centers on a new murder in the building (how does that even keep happening?), and the way they unfold the [**mystery**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/the-anatomy-of-a-fall-movie-review) keeps you guessing without being annoying about it.

Season one set the standard with Tim Kono’s death. The reveal felt earned, even if I wasn’t completely satisfied with who the killer turned out to be. Season two ramped everything up with Bunny’s murder, giving us more character development alongside the investigation.

https://preview.redd.it/evq6djbepgdg1.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eaa6ae246155c3f09b9b7bbdf13f63261148fd2

Season three moved the action to a Broadway theater for Oliver’s production, which was a smart way to change the setting while keeping the core premise. The murder of actor Ben Glenroy brought in Meryl Streep and Paul Rudd, and honestly, watching Paul Rudd play a complete asshole was delightful.



***Read***[ ***The Flight Attendant– HBO Max Miniseries Review***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/the-flight-attendant-hbo-max-miniseries-review)



Season four focused on Sazz’s death, which hit harder because we actually cared about her character. The Hollywood angle with them making a movie about the podcast was meta in all the right ways.

Season five took an unexpected turn with the mafia-adjacent billionaire angle and the casino subplot. The fresh direction kept things interesting, even if it felt like a departure from earlier seasons.



# What Works Season After Season



The show maintains this perfect balance between comedy and genuine stakes.

One minute you’re laughing at Oliver’s theatrical meltdowns or Charles struggling with modern technology, the next you’re invested in solving an actual murder.

https://preview.redd.it/yz479zzgpgdg1.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=60e42a9d682f2eb3cb571d11de0a5b7975f3db6e

The production design is gorgeous. The Arconia feels like a character itself—this old New York building with secret passageways, quirky residents, and enough history to fuel multiple mysteries. Every apartment has its own aesthetic that tells you something about who lives there.

The music is phenomenal. The score creates this atmosphere that’s simultaneously classy and mysterious, like you’re sitting in an upscale coffee shop reading a thriller novel.

The runtime works perfectly. Episodes are tight, usually 30-35 minutes, which keeps things moving without feeling rushed. You can binge an entire season in a day if you’re so inclined (and I absolutely have).



# Where Each Season Stands



* **Season 1 (5/5):** The strongest season. Fresh concept, perfect execution, genuinely surprising moments. Set the bar incredibly high.
* **Season 2 (4.5/5):** Almost as good as the first. Deeper character development, higher stakes, though slightly messier with all the subplots.
* **Season 3 (4.5/5):** Solid but a noticeable step down. The theater setting was fun, but something felt off with the pacing. Still very watchable.
* **Season 4 (4/5):** Stronger than three, weaker than one and two. The Hollywood meta angle was clever, though some storylines felt forced.

https://preview.redd.it/w66sssbkpgdg1.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebd41ef7c90258145bf043d5935ca3d8c496f361

* **Season 5 (4/5):** The mafia billionaire casino angle was completely unexpected. Fresh and interesting, even if it strayed far from the original formula.

Some reveals felt obvious, but the journey was still entertaining.



# The Problems That Crept In



The show has gotten progressively more complicated with each season. Sometimes that works, sometimes it feels like they’re adding layers for the sake of adding layers rather than serving the story.

By season five, the number of characters and subplots can get overwhelming. Some storylines get dropped or resolved unsatisfyingly. The podcast element that was so central in season one takes a backseat in later seasons.

https://preview.redd.it/afgmrw3ppgdg1.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c1cd41e0db84d13bd4696f7e61ed0ec6c95be2b

The biggest issue is sustainability. *How many murders can realistically happen in one building before it becomes ridiculous?* The show acknowledges this with jokes, but it’s still a problem they’re dancing around.

Some character choices feel inconsistent, especially in later seasons. Charles’s testosterone subplot in season five felt unnecessarily contrived. Certain reveals telegraph themselves from miles away when earlier seasons kept you genuinely guessing.

# Why I Keep Coming Back



Despite the flaws, this show has become comfort viewing for me.

The trio’s friendship feels real and earned. Watching them support each other through increasingly absurd circumstances never gets old.

https://preview.redd.it/ml2moisrpgdg1.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=db6d8b8754337386151adfe0e4429792819c4595

The show respects its audience’s intelligence while still being accessible. You can engage deeply with theories and clues, or you can just enjoy watching three unlikely friends solve mysteries together.

As a [**true crime**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/monster-the-ed-gein-story-a-disturbing-portrait-done-mostly-right) obsessive, I appreciate how the show both celebrates and gently mocks the genre. It understands why people are drawn to these stories while acknowledging the ethical complications of treating real tragedies as entertainment.

The mystery element is handled well enough that I genuinely want to know what happens next. Even when I can guess the killer, the journey to the reveal keeps me invested.



# Should You Start This Murder Journey? My Final Verdict



If you love mystery shows, true crime, or character-driven comedy, absolutely start this series. The first season especially, is near-perfect television that hooks you immediately.

Go in knowing the quality fluctuates across seasons. One and two are peak television. Three through five are still good, but don’t quite recapture that initial magic.



***Read*** [***The Running Man 2025 Movie Review***](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/the-running-man-2025-movie-review)



The show works best when you let yourself get invested in the characters rather than just focusing on solving the mystery. The whodunit is fun, but the real heart is watching this unlikely friendship develop.

Fair warning, though. Once you start, you’ll probably binge the entire thing. The episodes are short enough that “one more” turns into finishing the season at 3 AM.

1qdcq40,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1qdcq40/how_to_make_almost_anyone_laugh_in_seconds_the/,How to Make Almost ANYONE Laugh in Seconds: The Psychology Comedians Actually Use,"I spent months analyzing stand-up specials, improv techniques, and social psychology research because I was tired of being the person who killed conversations instead of lighting them up. Turns out, making people laugh isn't about being naturally funny or having a arsenal of jokes. It's about understanding specific patterns that trigger laughter, and most of us are doing the exact opposite of what actually works.



The real issue? We've been taught that humor is a talent you're born with. But neuroscience shows laughter is a social bonding mechanism that can be reliably activated. The best comedians, podcasters, and charismatic people aren't magically funnier, they just understand the formula. Here's what actually works based on psychology research, comedy masterclasses, and trial by fire.



Stop trying to be funny. Seriously.



The biggest mistake people make is forcing jokes. When you're trying too hard, people can smell the desperation. Instead, focus on being observant and pointing out the absurdity that's already there. Comedian Pete Holmes talks about this on his podcast You Made It Weird, he says the funniest people are just noticing what everyone else is ignoring. 



Next time you're in a situation, look for the weird detail everyone's pretending isn't weird. At a boring meeting? Point out that Dave's been eating carrots for 20 minutes straight. Waiting in a long line? Comment on how we're all collectively standing in organized formation like penguins. You're not making a joke, you're just saying what's true but unexpected.



Use the Rule of Three



This technique comes straight from improv comedy and it's stupidly effective. Set up a pattern with two normal items, then break it with something absurd on the third. ""I love my morning routine: coffee, meditation, and screaming into the void."" The first two create expectation, the third violates it. That surprise is what triggers laughter.



Listen to Conan O'Brien's podcast Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend and count how many times he uses this structure. It's basically muscle memory for professional comedians. Practice this pattern until it becomes automatic. Your brain will start generating these combinations naturally in conversations.



Master the callback



Reference something from earlier in the conversation but add a twist. Someone mentioned their cat knocked over a plant two hours ago? When something chaotic happens later, say ""Was that your cat again?"" It shows you're paying attention and creates an inside joke in real time. 



The book The Comedy Bible by Judy Carter breaks this down brilliantly. She's coached thousands of stand up comedians and won multiple awards for her work in comedy education. This book will make you question everything you think you know about humor. It's not about joke writing, it's about understanding comedic structure and timing. Carter teaches you to mine your own life for material and construct callbacks that land every single time. Insanely good read if you want to understand the architecture of laughter.



Embrace self-deprecating humor, but strategically



Mock yourself about things you're actually confident about. If you're good at your job, make a joke about being incompetent at it. If you're in good shape, joke about being lazy. The contrast between reality and the joke is what makes it funny. Never self-deprecate about genuine insecurities, that just makes people uncomfortable.



Research from social psychology shows that high-status individuals who use self-deprecating humor become MORE likable, while low-status individuals become less likable. The key is you need to be punching down at yourself from a position of security, not genuinely putting yourself down.



Physical comedy is underrated



An unexpected facial expression or exaggerated gesture can be funnier than any verbal joke. Try the ""slow turn"" when someone says something ridiculous, just slowly rotate your head toward them with a blank expression. Or the ""freeze"" where you stop mid-movement when caught doing something mundane. 



Watch any Jim Carrey or Melissa McCarthy performance. Half the laughs come from their face and body, not their lines. You don't need to be a physical comedy genius, just adding slight exaggeration to normal movements makes things instantly funnier.



Timing beats content



A mediocre joke with perfect timing destroys a great joke with bad timing. The pause before the punchline is where the magic happens. Practice adding a half-second delay before your callback or observation. Let the tension build. Most people rush through because they're nervous, but that pause is literally where laughter lives.



BeFreed is an AI-powered personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google. Type in what you want to master, like social skills or communication timing, and it creates customized audio podcasts from expert talks, research papers, and books. You control the depth, switching from 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that builds an adaptive learning plan based on your goals and keeps evolving as you learn. The voice options are honestly addictive, you can pick anything from a sarcastic narrator to a deep, calming tone like Samantha from Her. It's been useful for understanding conversational patterns and reading social cues without having to sit through generic advice.



Use absurd comparisons



Take something normal and compare it to something completely unrelated. ""That meeting felt like being trapped in an elevator with elevator music, except the elevator music was also my boss talking about quarterly reports."" The more unexpected the comparison, the better.



Watch old episodes of 30 Rock or read anything by David Sedaris. They're masters of the absurd comparison. Sedaris especially, his essays are basically masterclasses in finding the perfect metaphor that's just slightly unhinged.



React bigger than expected



When something mildly annoying happens, react like it's a catastrophe. When something good happens, underreact. The mismatch between event and reaction is inherently funny. Your friend got you a coffee? ""Oh my god, I'm gonna cry, this is the nicest thing anyone's ever done."" Printer jammed? Just sigh and say ""well, that's fine I guess.""



Ask absurd questions



Instead of making statements, frame observations as questions. ""Why do we pretend like business casual makes sense? You're professional from the waist up but chaos below?"" Questions invite people into the bit instead of performing at them.



The thing is, humans are wired to bond through laughter. It releases oxytocin and dopamine, the same chemicals involved in falling in love and forming friendships. The people who make us laugh become people we trust. These techniques aren't manipulation, they're just working with your brain's existing architecture instead of against it.



The patterns exist everywhere once you start looking. The absurdity is already there. Social dynamics create comedy constantly, you're just learning to spot it and amplify it. Practice this stuff in low stakes environments, text messages with friends, casual conversations, Zoom calls. You'll start noticing what lands and what doesn't, then calibrate.



Nobody's born funny. Some people just figured out the pattern recognition earlier. Now you have it too.",1,1768460485.0,rSocialskillsAscend,0,1.0,False

His hands felt weak from holding the receiver; his heart slowed to something resembling normal. Reaching the bed, Jake lay down, the blanket closing around his lonely body. The dim light attracting careless moths reflected in the droplets slowly sliding down his cheek.

Morning arrived like a loop—again with birdsong. His body ached as if after heavy training: sore muscles, dull joints. He got up, walked to the kitchen, and made black coffee with cream. The drink woke him, but also mirrored his emptiness: he looked older than his age, the stubble making him seem worn, as if he had aged several years overnight.

The search had become routine. Many possible paths, but every one led to a dead end. Walking the streets felt like repeating the same equation—same steps, same answers.

The sunlight shifted from white to pink as the city grew quieter. Heavy thoughts dissolved for a moment, but the scars on his arm pulled him back to what had happened. Jake sat on the curb by the labyrinth, looking at the landscape and feeling the dried crust of blood under his fingertips.

Click.

The sound came from the right, echoing off the labyrinth’s walls.
A click — old, rusty shears.

Squinting, Jake saw an elderly man. He was different from the others — alone, a real figure among cardboard townsfolk.
Click — another sprout snapped off and fell.

The gardener, whom Jake had never noticed before, was tall and wiry, wearing round glasses that reflected the world as a flat picture. A dark yellow coverall hung on his frame, his face covered with stubble, thick unkempt mustache and brows. Despite the warm weather, his arms were hidden under a heavy dark sweater pulled down to his wrists.

He worked automatically, movement after movement repeating itself. Jake watched him as the man slowly approached.

A little more than a meter away, the gardener stopped, turned his head, and said:

“Good afternoon. Night is coming quicker now, which means winter is close. Got a cigarette?”

Jake silently pulled one from his pocket and handed it over. The man took it with thin fingers, tore off the filter, and clamped it between his lips.

He thanked him — his voice surprisingly clear for someone smoking straight tobacco.

The gardener sat beside him, calmly drawing in smoke. He didn’t rush, exhaling into the fading light, almost dissolving in it.

The two of them sat together, leaning against the thick foliage, quietly watching the evening advance.

“What’s the meaning of all this?” the man asked.

“All of what?”

“The meaning of existence. Of life. What do you think?”

“I don’t think about that. I have bigger problems.”

“Think about it. Then you’ll find the answers you’re looking for.”

“What do you want me to say? I’m not a philosopher. This stuff doesn’t interest me.”

“I’m not a philosopher either. But you still haven’t thought about it. Try.”

“Just get to the point.”

“The point is meaning. The whole meaning is to live life in happiness.”

“Happiness?”

“A state anyone can reach. Anywhere, whatever they’re doing. Happiness is brief, but you can catch it.”

“I can’t be happy until I find what I’m looking for.”

“And what are you looking for, boy?”

“I lost my love. Lost my girlfriend. And my child.”

“You’re tied down. Bound like with rope. Let go — and it will ease.”

“I can’t. And I won’t. I need to know what happened to her.”

My family did a Christmas exchange of a real gift and a gag gift, I live with my grand parents and my parents and sister live together as well, just in another house.

A few days before xmas my mom and I were talking about dinner and she said “Btw, are we going heavy with the gag gifts?” (Meaning that it could be a bit mean) I thought about it for a second, thinking back to how I got ponytails for my bald stepdad (he doesn’t get offended by this, actually finds these jokes hilarious if made by the right person) so I responded “I think so!” and she said “Oh good, I just had to make sure” and something told me it’s going to for sure be about my weight.  You see, I did use to live with my mom and stepdad but because they were very ab*sive I decided to move out with my grandparents and start therapy, and although I forgave them, I’m very clear about my limits, talking about my body is a very big one for me. My mom is the one who always used to limit my food and make cruel jokes and comments about my body even when I was a little kid.

As soon as I opened my gag gift I said “Oh, hell yeah!”, just to conceal what I actually thought and also because I was sort of prepared.

I’m 25, living in Tokyo. I moved to Japan from Russia about 3 years ago — first as a language student, now on a work visa.

Because of my introverted nature and being constantly busy, I didn’t really manage to build friendships or relationships here. To be completely honest, I’ve never been in a relationship at all. For a long time, I intentionally ignored this side of life and focused on work and survival mode.

But now, at 25, I’ve started to feel genuinely lonely.

Dating apps haven’t worked for me, and approaching people in real life is very difficult due to my personality — so I decided to try Reddit.

I don’t plan to leave Japan.

Ideally, I’d like to connect with someone who already lives in Japan or is planning to move here in the near future.

It doesn’t matter to me if you’re not in Tokyo — in case of a serious connection, I’m open to relocating to another prefecture.



A bit about my background:

I write my own web novel. Back in Russia, I was deeply involved in the VTuber industry — mostly on the management side — working closely with VTubers, artists, and riggers. After moving to Japan, most of those connections slowly faded.



Music-wise, I’m a huge fan of German rock and metal:

Eisbrecher, OOMPH!, Rammstein, dArtagnan, Feuerschwanz.

I also enjoy Japanese rock and pop, like ZUTOMAYO, Yorushika, GARNiDELiA, WagakkiBand, and SHACHI.



As for VTubers, my all-time favorites are:

Kizuna AI — whom I deeply respect as the pioneer of the industry and as a fellow professional,

Korone Ch — the main reason I fell deep into the VTuber rabbit hole,

and Houshou Marine — I just love her energy and atmosphere.



I used to be a big anime fan (around 1500 titles watched) and a passionate gamer, though in recent years I somehow lost that spark.

I’d really love to meet someone who could help me rediscover it — or even introduce me to a new world altogether.



I’m looking for a girl with similar interests, but I want to start simple: conversation first.

If you live in Japan, I’d be happy to chat, and if you’re nearby, go for a walk, grab coffee, or just spend time together casually.



If any of this resonates with you, feel free to message me.

Even a simple “hi” is more than enough.

It's not a dramatic, 'end of the world' kind of thing, but more like a slow leak in a tire – barely noticeable at first, but eventually you're just driving on the rim.

For context, I'm a 32-year-old guy, pretty standard life: job, apartment, small circle of friends. Lately though, work has been soul-crushing, and I feel like I'm just going through the motions. Everything feels…grey. Weekends are spent catching up on sleep I missed during the week, and the things I used to enjoy (video games, hiking, even just grabbing coffee with friends) feel like chores.

I started noticing it a few months ago. I’d come home from work, stare at the TV for hours, and then go to bed. I used to be an avid reader, but now the thought of even opening a book feels exhausting. My friends have noticed too. Last week, Liam, my best friend, asked if I was okay. I just shrugged and said I was tired. He looked genuinely concerned, and that made me feel even worse.

Then, yesterday, it really hit me. I was brushing my teeth, and I looked in the mirror. I didn't recognize myself. Not physically, but… the light in my eyes was gone. It was like I was looking at a shell of a person, someone just going through the motions. I spent like ten minutes just staring, completely frozen.

Afterward, I just sat on the edge of my bed, thinking. I realized that I've been so focused on just surviving the day-to-day grind that I've completely forgotten what it feels like to actually *live*. I don't know what to do about it. I'm thinking maybe therapy? Or a long vacation? Honestly, I'm just hoping someone else has felt this way and can offer some advice. I feel lost, and really, really want to find myself again.

Paidwork is a micro-task app where you earn money by doing simple online stuff like:
Playing mobile games 🎮
Taking surveys 📝
Watching short videos 📺
Testing apps
Cashback shopping
Referring friends
You earn small amounts per task and withdraw once you hit the minimum payout (usually around $5–$10 depending on region).

✅ Pros (What’s Actually Good)
Easy to use, beginner-friendly
Multiple earning options (not just surveys)
Free to join — no investment
Flexible: do tasks anytime, anywhere
For killing time and earning a few bucks, it’s not terrible.

❌ Cons (Real Talk)
Pay is low for the time spent
Surveys often disqualify you midway 😒
Withdrawals can be slow
Some users report account issues before payout
This is not a serious income source. Anyone saying otherwise is coping.

💡 Who Is It For?
Good if you:
Want pocket money
Are a student
Don’t mind slow earnings
Use it casually
Not for you if you:
Need guaranteed income
Expect fast payouts
Value your time highly

🧠 My Verdict
Paidwork is legit, but it’s a side-side hustle. Think coffee money, not rent money. Use it when you’re bored, not when you’re broke.
TL;DR:
✔ Pays real money
❌ Pays slowly
⚖️ Okay for spare time, bad as a main hustle.

I’m not a writer or anything. Just needed to get this out somewhere, and this sub felt… right.

So I used to work night security at a small apartment complex. Nothing fancy. Mostly bored walks, bad coffee, and pretending I wasn’t scared of my own footsteps. I’d been doing it for about 6 months, so I thought I was used to the sounds. Pipes knocking. Wind. Cats fighting. All that stuff.

This happened around 3:20am. I remember because I checked my phone right after and my hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped it.

I was sitting in the little security office when the lobby camera flickered. Not unusual. Old system. But when it came back, there was someone standing in the lobby.

Just standing there.

Didn’t come in through the door. Didn’t move. Just… there. Head down. Facing the camera.

I zoomed in, expecting it to be a resident messing around. The image got grainy, and that’s when I noticed the feet.

Bare feet. Dirty. Like they’d been walking outside for a while.

I grabbed my radio and said something stupid like, “Uh, can I help you?” No response. The camera audio was working. I could hear the hum of the lights. No breathing. No movement.

Then the head tilted up.

I swear to god, I felt my stomach drop. The face looked wrong. Not in a “monster” way. More like… unfinished. Eyes open too wide. Mouth slightly open, like it forgot what it was supposed to do.

The camera cut out.

I ran to the lobby. I know, dumb. But adrenaline does weird things. The lobby was empty. Doors locked. No one hiding. No footprints. Nothing.

I didn’t finish my shift. I told my supervisor the system glitched and left. I quit a week later.

Here’s the part that really gets me. Months later, I was scrolling through old archived incident reports (don’t ask why). Found one from 2009. Same building. Night guard.

“Unidentified individual observed on lobby camera. No entry recorded. Subject vanished before contact.”

I still love horror. Movies, games, all of it. But sometimes, late at night, when my phone camera glitches or my screen freezes on someone’s face?

Yeah. I don’t laugh it off anymore.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I’ve been on a journey of dialing in my V60 pour-over for about two years now and slowly understanding the craft cup by cup. I’m currently based in Europe and have a few favorite local roasters here (happy to recommend some if anyone’s interested).

I’ll be traveling to India in March and would love to explore the specialty coffee scene and bring back some good beans. The only roastery I’m familiar with in Delhi so far is Devan’s (had a lot of their coffee and always thought it was good)— I left India about 11 years ago, so I’m a bit out of touch with what’s new.

I’d really appreciate recommendations for good roasteries across India, especially those offering Indian-origin beans (single estate, microlots, experimental processing, etc.), as imported coffees are easy for me to find back home.

1qdc9jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1qdc9jg/top_luxury_premium_café_brands_in_bangalore_where/,Top Luxury & Premium Café Brands in Bangalore: Where Coffee Becomes an Experience,"Bangalore is no longer just India’s tech capital — it is also the coffee capital of modern India. From global giants to home grown specialty roasters, the city has evolved into a playground for serious coffee lovers. 

Today, cafés are not just about caffeine; they are about ambience, lifestyle, work culture, community, and brand experience.

Among many celebrated names, a few brands truly dominate Bangalore’s premium café landscape. This article explores the most influential and luxurious café brands in the city, their specialities, and why Coffee Brewery stands tall as the most complete coffee destination among them all.

 

# 1. Coffee Brewery – Bangalore’s Most Complete Luxury Café Experience

When it comes to scale, menu depth, ambience, and adaptability,  *Coffee Brewery* clearly leads Bangalore’s premium café scene.

What sets Coffee Brewery apart is its holistic café philosophy — it is not just a coffee brand, but a modern lifestyle café designed for India’s evolving urban audience. From tech parks and high-streets to premium commercial hubs, the brand blends specialty coffee craftsmanship with business-friendly design.

# Speciality & Strengths

·  Wide range of specialty coffees, classic espresso, cold brews, and signature beverages

·  Fully fledged café menu including gourmet sandwiches, wraps, desserts, English breakfast and all-day options

·  Spacious interiors ideal for meetings, work-from-café culture, and long stays

·  Strong presence in IT parks and premium business locations, something most brands struggle to execute well

·  Designed for scalability and consistency, making it future-ready

Unlike niche cafés that cater to a limited audience,  *Coffee Brewery* balances **l**uxury, accessibility, and volume — which is why it is increasingly seen as Bangalore’s most reliable premium café brand.

The best overall café brand in Bangalore for coffee, food, ambience, and business viability.

 

# 2. Starbucks – The Global Luxury Coffee Benchmark

Starbucks needs no introduction. As the world’s most recognised coffee brand, Starbucks represents consistency, familiarity, and international café culture.

# Speciality

·   Globally standardised beverages

·   Premium pricing with predictable taste

·   Strong brand recall and aspirational value

# Limitations in Bangalore

While Starbucks excels in branding, it often lacks localised menu depth and space flexibility. Many outlets are compact and not ideal for extended work sessions. The menu is coffee-centric, with limited food innovation compared to Indian café expectations.

Best for global brand lovers, less flexible for local café needs.

 

# 3. Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters – India’s Specialty Coffee Pioneer

Blue Tokai has played a crucial role in educating Indian consumers about single-estate and freshly roasted coffee. It is respected, minimal, and serious about beans.

# Speciality

·  Direct-from-farm sourcing

·  Single-origin Indian coffee

·  Clean, minimalist café design

# Limitations

Blue Tokai cafés are often small, focused, and utilitarian. The experience is excellent for coffee purists but limited for families, groups, or long working hours. Food options are intentionally minimal.

Best for coffee purists, not a full luxury café experience.



# 4. Third Wave Coffee – Modern, Youth-Focused Café Chain

Third Wave Coffee has rapidly expanded across Bangalore, positioning itself as a **t**ech-savvy, affordable premium café.

# Speciality

·  Quick service

·  Consistent coffee quality

·  Youth-friendly pricing and modern design

# Limitations

While popular, Third Wave focuses more on speed and scalability than luxury. Outlets are compact, menu innovation is limited, and the experience is closer to a premium quick-service café than a luxury destination.

The Great everyday café, but not truly luxurious.

 

# 5. Café Coffee Day (Select Outlets) – The Legacy Brand

CCD is the brand that introduced café culture to India. While many outlets are now dated, select premium CCD lounges still hold nostalgic and commercial value.

# Speciality

·   Mass familiarity

·   Strong legacy presence

·   Affordable pricing

# Limitations

The brand struggles with modern luxury perception, menu innovation, and premium ambience when compared to newer players.

An Iconic legacy, but no longer a luxury leader.

 

# 6. International & Boutique Cafés (Lavelle Road, UB City, Indiranagar)

Cafés like Café Noir, Lavazza outlets, and European-style coffee houses offer refined ambience and gourmet food, mostly concentrated in elite neighbourhoods.

# Speciality

·   Elegant interiors

·   European café feel

·   Upscale clientele

# Limitations

These cafés are location-dependent, expensive, and difficult to scale. They cater more to leisure than daily coffee routines or work culture.

 Luxury in pockets, not city-wide dominance.

 

When comparing all major brands on five critical parameters — coffee quality, food range, ambience, work-friendliness, and scalability —*Coffee Brewery* consistently outperforms.

Bangalore has many great cafés — but only one brand successfully combines premium coffee, a full café menu, business-friendly ambience, and scalable luxury.

Coffee Brewery is not just keeping up with global brands — it is setting a new benchmark for India’s modern café culture.

For coffee lovers, professionals, and entrepreneurs alike, *Coffee Brewery* represents the future of premium cafés in Bangalore.",0,1768458907.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.1,False

Chapter 1 

I folded Morgan’s navy blue dress shirt with practiced precision, my fingers automatically checking for loose threads or missed buttons. Five years of marriage had taught me his preferences-no starch, sleeves lightly pressed, collars always turned down. The familiar ritual usually brought me comfort, but today something felt off. 

“Just three months,” Morgan had said over breakfast, his coffee black and bitter like his business meetings. “The expansion into Southeast Asia could double our revenue this quarter.” 

I nodded, stacking another shirt beside the first. “And you’ll be back for Gabriella’s birthday?” 

“Of course.” He kissed my forehead, brief and distracted. “I wouldn’t miss it.” 

Now, as I packed his Rimowa suitcase-the one he insisted was worth the ridiculous price tag-I wondered if he’d remembered to pack his medication. The thought led me to check the side pocket where he kept his emergency pills. 

My fingers brushed against something else. Something that didn’t belong. 

“Looking for something?” 

I startled at his voice. Morgan stood in the doorway of our bedroom, watching me with that half-smile that had once made my heart race. 

“Just your heart medication,” I said, keeping my voice steady. “You almost forgot it last time.” 

He nodded, distracted by his phone. “Right. Good catch.” 

As he disappeared back into his home office, I returned to the suitcase. The side pocket had been sewn closed-not completely, just enough to make it look like a manufacturing defect. But I knew better. Morgan was meticulous about his luggage. 

With trembling fingers, I carefully picked at the stitching until it gave way. Inside was a small manila envelope, yellowed at the edges. 

I slid out the contents. 

Photographs. At least a dozen of them. 

My breath caught in my throat. 

Morgan. My husband. With a woman I didn’t recognize. 

They were intimate-his arm around her waist, her head thrown back in laughter, his lips pressed against her temple. In one photo, they were at a beach resort I’d never seen, her in a bikini, him in swim trunks, bodies pressed together as the sun set behind them. 

The woman was beautiful-young, maybe early twenties, with glossy dark hair and a smile that seemed to know secrets I wasn’t privy to. 

Beneath the photos were receipts. A diamond tennis bracelet from Tiffany’s. Dinner at Le Bernardin-$478 for two. A weekend at the Four Seasons. 

Dates on the receipts corresponded with nights Morgan had claimed to be working late. 

“Elina? You almost done?” His voice called from downstairs. “Car’s here in twenty minites.” 

“Almost finished!” I called back, carefully replacing everything exactly as I’d found it. 

The next afternoon, I drove to Little Melodies Preschool to pick up Gabriella. My hands gripped the steering wheel too tightly, knuckles white against the 

leather. 

“Mommy!” Gabriella raced toward me, her backpack bouncing against her small frame. “Miss Jasmine taught us a new song today! Want to hear?” 

I swallowed hard, forcing a smile. “Of course, sweetheart.” 

As Gabriella climbed into her car seat, chattering about her day, I made my way to the classroom to sign the pickup log.

Chapter 1 

And there she was. 

Jasmine Holmes. Gabriella’s music teacher. 

She looked up from her desk, recognition flickering across her face. “Mrs. Stewart! How are you?” 

“Fine, thank you.” My voice sounded distant, even to my own ears. 

She turned, reaching for something on her desk, and that’s when I saw it. 

The necklace. 

A delicate gold chain with a pendant-a small diamond surrounded by tiny sapphires. Unique. Distinctive. 

I’d seen it before. Around the neck of the woman in those photographs. 

“We’re learning about world music next week,” Jasmine continued, oblivious to my scrutiny. “Gabriella has such a lovely voice.” 

“Yes,” I managed. “She loves your class.” 

Jasmine smiled, touching the necklace unconsciously. “She’s a joy to teach. So bright.” 

I nodded, unable to trust my voice further. My daughter’s beloved teacher. The woman in those photos. 

The woman sleeping with my husband. 

Somehow, I maintained my composure. Somehow, I made small talk about the weather, about Gabriella’s upcoming school performance. Somehow, I walked out of that classroom with my signature on the log and my dignity intact. 

Back home, with Gabriella napping, I sat at my laptop.. 

My fingers hovered over the keyboard. Part of me wanted to confront Morgan before he left tomorrow. Demand answers. Throw those photographs at 

his feet. 

But another part-the part that had helped me earn a degree in English Literature with honors-knew better. 

I created a new email account. Then a new Facebook profile. 

“Kate Morrison,” I typed. “Interested in music education and meeting new people.” 

I uploaded a stock photo of a woman with dark hair, similar to mine but not quite. Added some generic interests. 

Then I searched for Jasmine Holmes. 

Her profile was surprisingly easy to find. Lots of photos. Lots of updates. 

“Another wonderful weekend with my favorite person,” read one caption under a photo of her holding a glass of wine in a restaurant I recognized from the receipts. 

I scrolled further, 

“A special gift from a special man. #blessed #divorcedbusinessman” 

My stomach clenched as I clicked on the photo. The diamond tennis bracelet from Tiffany’s gleamed on her wrist. 

Morgan’s wristwatch was visible in the background. ",1,1768458599.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

1qdc2wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1qdc2wf/had_to_take_a_dump_in_the_luskin_hotel/,Had to take a dump in the Luskin Hotel,"After my coffee this evening, I had a heavy feeling. I squeezed my buttcheeks past the receptionist desk and sublty went into the restroom only to take a shit-piss in the first toilet stall I could find. Someone had dropped a silver pen on tbe ground but I didn't pick it up. 

  
Come over there and take a shit with me so I don't feel awkward as we exit while the staff give us a dirty look! 

  
My professor admitted a bad example to me at office hours this evening. He said that when he was my age, he had a huge van and drove across the country meeting and sleeping around. I didn't ask if he smoked, I was just shocked in disbelief because he is so educated and I couldn't tell he'd done that. 

  
My neighbor has an SUV. I should ask him if I could borrow that for spring break and drive to Fort Lauderdale and compare the U. Florida party scene with the UCSB crowd. 

  
Last year, before this one guy left for spring break to Panama City, he took a dump at the sauna in Wooden so that no one could enjoy it like he did while he was gone. Why do people have to be so mean? Fuck that. ",2,1768458284.0,ucla,1,0.58,False

From pump start, it takes ~15 seconds before any coffee exits the basket. The top of the puck is clearly saturated during this time, but the bottom doesn’t see water until much later, which makes me concerned about uneven extraction.

I suspect it’s taking a long time to build pressure in the system, but I can’t figure out why.

Additional context:
• Happens regardless of grind size
• Boiler is full
• Pump has been replaced
• I have calibrated the OPV to 8bar",4,1768458215.0,ranciliosilvia,13,0.83,False

It's late at night here, see if there are any introverted 🦉 that feel ''alive at night.'' and wanting to be long-term friends and the night can belong to us, long winded text messages in the night. U.S. but I'm a night 🦉 Why I'm posting here 😂","Yeah, yesterday I did feel sad, decided to go to Starbucks for an iced coffee and ordered me a Sleep Token shirt to feel better 🤣

And, I had to make one more final post because this would be a surprise but there were a lot of people asking, I don't understand what you mean by the 👻 app and to be fair I thought Redditors would know that's Snapchat 😂 

To be honest I enjoy using Snapchat as a messenger app, obviously I just don't enjoy all childish features and other childish things 🤣

There have been a few Redditors asking me, what is Signal and I could download that to text you. Yeah, and Signal is just a text messenger app, but the privacy is better than sketchy Telegram and Whatsapp.

Here is another reason why I uploaded my last posts, to clarify some common Q and A that I've been getting and I figured I should end my last post here for a while, with the Q and A.

Can I message you? I know your inbox must be full of messages and I don't feel that I could get your attention enough.

Yeah, well you only had 1 thing right and the rest are wrong 🤣 However, when I posted on the friendship subreddits that I post on, I did receive a combo of 25 chat request invites and this is where you were wrong 25 out of those chat requests 💀 

However, only 6 messages were the Redditors giving me a mini bio of their hobbies, interests and were letting me know what they thought of my post 🤣

Why did you delete the other messages then?

Hi and hey messages 💀 Yeah, your profile is private and your comments are private, obviously I can't see sht and I'm not saying hi or hey back to you 💀

The next removal.

Can you tell me how you're doing in the chat requests?

Thanks to your message, obviously you've proven to yourself that you just didn't read yesterday's post when I asked you to listen to three Sleep Token songs that I provided for you to listen to. 

If you can't listen to three songs that I've asked, can I ask can you even invest in me as a friend? That goes to yesterday, that nobody did the request that I asked yesterday about confirming if you read anything on my profile the other day.

However, my mood currently are Sleep Token Vore, Sleep Token Bloodsport, Sleep Token Dark Signs and Even In Arcadia and yeah, obviously I answer how I'm doing through music and that's because I'm just autistic as sht. 

This is how I communicate with people online on how I'm feeling.

Has anyone answered your Skyrim question?

That answer is only two people 🤣

Yeah, I guess that means people don't play Skyrim anymore 💀 Yeah, yesterday's post I asked for those that would message me in a chat requests would put something of a pun about Skyrim, what kind of food would I be in Skyrim, what kind of drink I would be, what kind of quest I would be and anything pun related 💀 Quite shocked that nobody didn't answer that in a chat request 💀 

If you plan on taking a break from Reddit in a few days, how would I get into contact with you? 

That's going to be on my bio, we're not allowed to promote here or do anything promotional, but there will be a 👻 Sleep Token group that I will make on that app to make TRUE Sleep Token fans. There will be updates on my bio and that's all I can say.

Can I message you? Yeah, I'd enjoy Sleep Token and I'm just not a megafan or have a hyper-fixation such as yourself.

Here is the thing that I should've clarified in the past posts that I've made in a few days. No you don't have to be a megafan of Sleep Token and have a hyper-fixaiton that is on my level. The only time you need to ask if I'm the person that you should be messaging, obviously should be a question of can you tolerate my hyper-fixations? If you can, then there isn't an issue with messaging me.

Yeah, I'm from the U.S. however, the locations I'm looking to text with people from Europe, Canada, Australia and U.S. as well if you stay up at 3-6 a.m. and I can feel a 6 a.m.coming 🤣

However, I'm the type of friend that will fall asleep on you without telling you and pick off where the conversation has left off, obviously this is my texting style and my autistic Vessel brain makes me think of things like this that enjoy 🌸 And, I wanted to say thanks for those that messaged me and said they listened to the songs that I asked to listen to see how I was doing.

More importantly a few people have reached out that were surprised that I'm able to type a lot of words and that's refreshing to see. Yeah, my Vessel brain is like a typewriter and most Redditors on subreddits looking for friends are ''just bored and looking for friendships they can easily give up or dispose of in a day.'' It's just how things are.

Yeah, obviously I didn't respond to those messages and with this being addressed, obviously this will be my last post for a while and I'd know I said that yesterday. However, I forgot to address yesterday that you can continue to still message me, obviously if this post interests you enough in the future.

Even if this post grows 30 days old and sometimes you don't find the right friendships or the right friendships that you're looking for now and in the future you could just stumble on a post that vibes with you as well 🌸 To be honest before this post ends, never forget if you invest the time in me as a friend and I'll invest my time in you.

And speaking of friendships, you can be in your early 20s or mid 20s and I just don't find that weird. Yeah, obviously just because I'm looking for online friendships only and not real life hangouts, because I'm a broke girl on SSI and Food Stamps, cannot afford a plane ticket and things I would need to visit. However, obviously just doesn't mean our friendship is a joke to me and you're a joke to me as a person. Men's mental health is important to me and an important aspect to me as a person.

Just as well that all pronouns are welcomed to message me, if you're a bi male that's fine too, I'm an aroarce and yeah, I will not say why I'm an aroace when I've just known you and just know that my choice was made when I was 30, it's not something new. 

It's just something I want to get off my chest as well, that a few new friends I've made on friendship subreddits have appreciated my kindness as a person and called me a nice person.

The truth is, I'm in denial that I'm not a nice person and I don't believe that I'm. If you burn a bridge with me, I can burn that bridge just in the similarity of caramel. If caramel isn't watched carefully and not attended to carefully the caramel can burn and scorch as well.

Yeah, you wonder why Vessel says these lines.

So stick to me, stick to me like caramel 🎶🎶 Walk beside me till you feel nothing as well 🎶 🎶

Vessel is just telling the fake Sleep Token fans that you can burn him, go against everything Sleep Token stands for and be part of the pro-maskless community while you just can feel nothing as well.

Yeah, obviously just stick to him like burnt caramel to feel what he feels when you burn/scorch him.

However, for those that are legitimately kind to me, don't try to make me uncomfortable, don't try to silence my hobbies, or tolerate my hyper-fixations on Sleep Token, obviously you will be rewarded with a nice bubbled caramel.

However, that caramel would end up turning out beautiful and you get to see the ''real side of me, that most people will never see in real life.'

And most days all I listen to is Sleep Token and Lorna Shore Will Ramos era and no I just don't listen to anything else lately. However, I will be posting on my bio later of the other bands that I listen to 🌸
