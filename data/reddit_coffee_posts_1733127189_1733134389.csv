I‚Äôve been on a clean keto journey for the past 2 months, following a gout attack 3 months ago. Previously I was on Keto for 1.5 years. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or insights on my current approach and recent blood-work results.

**Diet:**

* Meals include eggs, salad, chicken, low-to-moderate purine vegetables, moderate cheese.
* No processed foods or meats.
* Black coffee: 3-4 cups daily. 

**Fasting:**

* 18+ hours daily (usually 20:4).
* Finish dinner at least 4 hours before bed. 

**Activity:**

* Moderate daily walking (10‚Äì15 minutes). 

**Blood-work Results (Metric & Imperial):**

* Triglycerides: **160 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L)**
* HDL: **40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L)**
* LDL: **189 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L)**
* Uric Acid: **8 mg/dL (476 Œºmol/L)**
* Vitamin D: **120 ng/mL (300 nmol/L)**

**Pre-Test Details:**

* No coffee for at least 40 hours.
* 15-hour fast.
* Last meal: chicken, salad, vegetable soup.

**My Body Composition:**

* BMI: **21.5**
* Weight: **68 kg (150 lbs)**
* Height: **180 cm (5‚Äô11‚Äù)**
* Body fat: **19%** (subcutaneous: 17.6%)
* BMR: **1549 kcal**
* Metabolic age: **33 years**

I‚Äôm happy with the keto lifestyle but am concerned about managing gout long-term and improving my lipid profile, particularly the LDL and HDL. My uric acid levels seem high despite being careful with purines.Would love to hear from anyone who has managed gout on keto, or who has advice on tweaking my routine to improve these numbers. Thanks in advance!Best regards",1,1733133957.0,keto,0,1.0,False

I've been a few times previously to Rusutsu and Niseko. Loved rusutsu's variety of terrain. 

Weighing up between the following:

-basing ourselves in Furano for about a 8 days. Maybe make a day trip to Ashahidake or Kurodake. Lmk if there are any worthwhile resorts around Furano.

-staying in Kiroro and splitting the time between Kiroro, Niseko and rusutsu.

-remaining in Japan's South island and base ourselves around Nagano. Try to hit up Shiga Kogen and Nowaza Onsen. 

Even though we have concerns over crowds in Niseko, we both appreciate good food and drink options (good coffee is a must!). Particularly with the girlfriend who probably will go out for 3-4hrs tops, it would be good to have some options off the slopes. 

Would love some feedback on option 2 and 3. I like the sound of Furano but afraid the missus might get a bit bored after a week. 

Shiga Kogen looks like a really solid terrain and snow quality for the South island, but the accomm and facilities look dated and tacky (which is what I sort of felt in rusutsu). Nozawa looks like the village is lively, but thinking the terrain looks mediocre. 

Is it too much trouble staying off the mountain in Shiga and driving up each day?

Choosing the perfect coffee table involves considering your living room layout, style, and how you use the space. Whether you‚Äôre drawn to [natural furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) or love the charm of [rattan side tables](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-side-tables), here‚Äôs how to make the right choice.

# 1. Understand Your Living Room Layout

Start by analyzing your living room's dimensions and furniture placement. A coffee table should complement the size of your space without overwhelming it. For smaller living rooms, opt for a compact design like a [round outdoor coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-coffee-tables). Its soft edges create an inviting flow and avoid sharp corners that can feel restrictive. In larger spaces, consider broader tables with intricate designs to anchor the area.

# 2. Match Your Style with Natural Furniture

Natural furniture adds a timeless, organic touch to your living room. Coffee tables crafted from materials like wood, rattan, or bamboo blend seamlessly with various interior aesthetics. If your space leans towards a bohemian or rustic theme, a rattan side table can serve as a stylish and functional coffee table, adding texture and warmth to your decor.

# 3. Prioritize Functionality

Your coffee table should serve both aesthetic and practical purposes. If you frequently entertain guests, look for designs with built-in storage or multiple tiers for keeping essentials like coasters, remotes, and books organized. A round outdoor coffee table can be versatile enough for indoor and [outdoor furniture](https://beta.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/outdoor-furniture) setups, offering durability and charm for flexible living.

# 4. Consider Material Durability

The material of your coffee table should align with your lifestyle. For families with kids or pets, consider sturdy options like natural wood or metal, which can withstand daily wear and tear. Rattan side tables, while lightweight and elegant, are ideal for spaces where they won‚Äôt be subjected to heavy use, making them perfect for adding a decorative flair.

# 5. Blend Indoor and Outdoor Elements

Living rooms that extend into patios or open spaces can benefit from versatile outdoor furniture. A round outdoor coffee table can seamlessly transition between indoor and outdoor use, creating a cohesive look for spaces that embrace nature-inspired designs.

# 6. Choose the Right Shape

The shape of your coffee table should enhance your room's layout. Rectangular tables suit linear seating arrangements, while round or oval tables soften sharp lines and are great for creating a relaxed ambiance. Rattan side tables are particularly effective in round or square shapes, adding a cozy and approachable vibe.

# 7. Balance Proportions

Your coffee table should align with the height and scale of your sofa and other furniture. Aim for a height slightly lower than your sofa cushions for easy access and a harmonious look. For larger living rooms, pairing a statement natural furniture coffee table with smaller accent pieces like rattan side tables can add depth and variety.

# Final Thoughts

Choosing the perfect coffee table for your living room layout requires a balance of style, functionality, and proportion. Whether you‚Äôre drawn to the earthy appeal of natural furniture or the breezy elegance of rattan side tables, there‚Äôs a design that can enhance your space. For those who love the versatility of outdoor furniture, a round outdoor coffee table might be the ideal solution.

Strawberry Milkshake üçìü•õ
Feminine but not overly girly‚Äîthis scent opens with a sharp berry note. It‚Äôs not a crisp, juicy strawberry but a very sweet, yummy berry. Within minutes, it settles into the most comforting creamy strawberry vanilla scent. It‚Äôs not as sweet as I expected, but honestly, it‚Äôs perfect.
üíó Vibe: A cheerful, happy fragrance that makes me want to wear an all-white or pink outfit.
‚ú® Projection: Subtle and not in-your-face‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt cause headaches.
‚è≥ Longevity: Lasts 1-2 hours on skin (with layering) and around 7 hours on clothes.

Coco Vanilla Bourbon ü••üåû
This is the easiest beachy scent I‚Äôve ever tried! Boozy, coconutty, with hints of vanilla and florals‚Äîit‚Äôs such a sunny, addictive fragrance.
üíõ Vibe: Totally gives ‚ÄúGoa wale beach pe‚Äù vibes‚Äîa must-have for summery vacations.
‚ú® Projection: Projects well‚Äîyou‚Äôll smell it around you for a good 1-2 hours.
‚è≥ Longevity: Lasts about 3 hours on skin and stays on clothes forever.
üìà Final Word: Highly underrated. I‚Äôm definitely buying the bigger size for the warmer months!

Smokey Vanilla üî•üç¶
I had high expectations since this was described as smelling like Kayali Vanilla 28. I own both, and here‚Äôs the deal: this one is smokier and less sweet. The smokiness overshadows the vanilla and brown sugar, making it bolder but less cozy.
üíº Vibe: Works beautifully for layering‚Äîfab when paired with sweeter scents.
‚ú® Projection: Decent.
‚è≥ Longevity: Lasts well on clothes but only 20-30 minutes on skin.

Caramel Pistachio üçÆüå∞
This is exactly what I wanted Sol de Janeiro 62 to be‚Äîor no, actually, it‚Äôs better! Sweet, nutty, and indulgent, it performs incredibly well.
üíö Vibe: A gourmand dream come true.
‚ú® Performance: Sillage is fantastic, and it lasts 6-7 hours on clothes.
üìà Final Word: That‚Äôs it. This is it. Bye, SDJ 62!

Cinnamon Apple Pie ü•ßüçé
Oh boy, this one is heavenly! It smells like a delicious apple pie served with whiskey‚Äîsweet, soothing, and cozy. It opens with cinnamon and apple before settling into brown sugar, cinnamon vanilla on the skin.
üíó Vibe: Perfect for winter‚Äîthis is what I wanted Khamrah to be.
‚ú® Performance: Lasts forever on clothes and makes me feel so cozy!
üìà Comparison: Sweeter and less boozy than Khamrah.

Espresso Vanilla ‚òïüåº
This is a boss babe scent through and through. It‚Äôs mature, sweet, floral, and bold‚Äîideal for work or formal occasions. Jasmine is prominent, blending beautifully with a creamy vanilla-coffee base.
üíº Vibe: Not a cozy, feel-good scent but perfect for meetings and professional settings.
‚ú® Performance: Strong and lasts well, but it needs 20-30 minutes to settle down.
‚è≥ Longevity: Performs well on clothes and holds up throughout the day.

Overall Thoughts üõçÔ∏è‚ú®

Now all of these scents are gourmand and an impressive effort from a muse beauty, a small Indian business. The pricing is fair for the quality offered, the packaging is also decent and the atomizers disperse the product beautifully. 

My only critique? The labels could use a better design‚Äîthey don‚Äôt look very attractive.

Day 2 brought me something I had no experience with - the **74-158 Kurume** varietal. And from nowhere other than **Yirgacheffe,** acknowledged by exciting aromatic heirloom varieties. I intentionally didn‚Äôt want to read too much about it (I even skipped the notes description for it) before tasting it to get an unbiased opinion. So let‚Äôs get straight to it. Please, keep in mind that aromas and taste descriptors mentioned here are very subjective and are what I smelled/tasted. It doesn‚Äôt mean you will experience the same. It‚Äôs the true beauty of coffee - it‚Äôs very non-deterministic and very subjective making this journey exciting. With that out of the way, let‚Äôs get to it.

I went for two brews to begin with. Both with:

* 1:15 ratio (15/225)
* Origami brewer
* Origami filter
* Water temp: 94
* Grind size. Here‚Äôs where it differed:
   * One brew was on medium at 25 clicks on Comandante c40
   * Another one at medium-coarse/coarse grind (30 clicks on Comandante c40).

https://preview.redd.it/tzcnxis7oe4e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b00fb4cd40ae18868c1ba972bc4f34b715deec2

**ROAST**:

Today‚Äôs roast was lighter than yesterday‚Äôs geisha. Quite comparable to my benchmark of the proper Scandinavian light roast from a well-known Oslo roaster. Which is supposed to suit the beans from Yirgacheffe perfectly üëè Take a comparison look at three roasts from left to right: the benchmark, day 1, day 2. Note how day 2 is very similar in color to the benchmark.

https://preview.redd.it/qe763gq9oe4e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22d0c07dc35609ce0ae5de08163393480fda604e

**AROMA**:

When opening the canister, again, just like day 1, I didn‚Äôt smell too much of a concentrated coffee. It was very muted and lacked personality. It was pretty standard coffee aroma - somewhat vegetable with distinctive tobacco notes. Nothing exceptional here.Even more so, I re-opened yesterday‚Äôs canister to smell and even it had more personality than today‚Äôs pick. To somebody who really enjoys coffee aromas that was a bummer. But ok, now I know it - one can not expect super fresh coffee in an advent calendar from different roasters. In this particular case we deal with coffee roasted in Denmark, sent to Norway, packed, sent to you and it‚Äôs all 2-3 weeks before you open the canister. But ok, I touched this in the yesterday‚Äôs post. Let‚Äôs get back to the aroma right off the canister.

When grinded, though, the coffee revealed very distinct dark chocolate notes. Pretty pleasant even though the chocolate notes are not my favorite in the specialty coffee. However, the dramatic difference in aroma before/after grinding left me puzzled. Apparently, the beans indeed had plenty of air contact to lose aromatics from the bean surface. Anyway, let‚Äôs continue the journey.

**TASTE**:

https://preview.redd.it/k6tzkxzcoe4e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe42c07d4a97d6a32d842f58d46706bbb08b3453

After brewing both cups, it was time to taste. As, probably, expected, the cup brewed with 30 clicks Comandante setting was pretty pale, light and a bit boring. Coffee just didn‚Äôt have enough extraction in this setting. The other cup was much more interesting. This is not to say ‚Äúreally interesting‚Äù, but more on that later. The notes of both cups was similar: quite distinctive sweet grape (I just love grape notes in coffee), stone fruits sweetness with some acidity. It reminded me of green apple where sweetness is combined with acidity to create a refreshing feeling. However, in this case, I didn‚Äôt get too much refreshment. The problem is that in order to get proper notes, I had to try hard. I would compare it with the experience of smelling something good and pleasant from behind a door, without being able to open the door and get closer to the source of that intriguing taste. To put it in other words - the taste, even though promising a lot to my liking, felt very muted. Just like the aroma.

As the cup cools down, the taste for me moved more into peach, again, with some acidity and then more into black tea area. ‚ÄúThe World Atlas of Coffee‚Äù explains this ‚Äúblack tea‚Äù notes at the end - it‚Äôs typical for coffees from Yirgacheffe (to quote: ‚Äúthey can remind some people more of a cup of Earl Grey tea than of a cup of coffee‚Äù)

**CONCLUSIONS**:

I really wanted to enjoy this cup. But it desperately didn‚Äôt want me to get that, hiding somewhere and just teasing the taste buds - you have to try and look for answers of what is that aroma, or what is that taste. But again, that‚Äôs probably, what makes coffee interesting - if it would be straightforward it would be juice. At the same time, this coffee wanted me to try too much in order to enjoy it. It‚Äôs not bad coffee, but it‚Äôs just too light, too fragile to my taste. And, again, I think it didn‚Äôt give its all potential simply because of the time passed after roasting. Would I want to buy a bag of this coffee? No, I don‚Äôt think so - it‚Äôs just not my cup of tea üòÖ. Did I enjoy it today? I think I enjoyed the process of identifying what this coffee has to offer much more than coffee itself.

**P.S** Again, according to The World Atlas of Coffee‚Äù coffees of the Yirgacheffe should be ‚Äúexplosively aromatic‚Äù (and I had exceptionally aromatic coffees from this region), however, ‚Äúlight and elegant body‚Äù is also one of the characteristics of coffees from this region.

Okay okay so here is the million dollar question-




""How close....is your personality or demeanor in public ....compared to in private?""

- meaning.... what's your personality like out in public or around others ? What is it like when other people aren't around.... and your in the confines of your home ? Are those people the same person? Or are they clearly different .... what makes the difference in how you behave ? And lastly....which one do you like more so ? Why ? (I did originally answer conflicted so don't doubt yourself here just truly write what comes to mind ü•πü§≠)


These are all things I was forced to answer in real time convo-in person w my counselor lol it was an emotional session realizing how much I cater to people i dont even know- how much ...i hide in fear of about a million things...

u lovely people are safe behind your screens and have a second to ponder it lol so I hope you can try for this one <3 certainly easier then in person lol  . Regardless of my answers.... it made me reflect how different i can be in public versus when I'm alone ? In lu of that ... I also realized both- good and negative things about how I manage to function via people's presence or not. I'm still- absolutely a people pleaser ...trying not to be too much or too loud or too ""xyz"" that I'm usually fragile and insecure in public ...quiet and unapproachable....and inside my own home I can be really goofy and free willed very talkative . 

It made me want to work at it - and now I'm wondering...if anybody else may in fact have similar situation or rather - come to similar conclusion. Interpret however you'd like to - i am truly just curious- to know peoples answers here.

From cozy winter retreats to breezy summer havens, the right [furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) can transform your space year-round. Here‚Äôs a guide to choosing the perfect furniture for every season, ensuring your home stays luxurious and inviting no matter the time of year.

# Winter: Embrace Warmth and Comfort

During the colder months, your home should exude coziness and warmth. Opt for plush sofas, upholstered chairs, and layered textures that invite relaxation. [Luxurious home furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) like velvet armchairs and oversized sectionals can add a touch of elegance while keeping you snug.

**Pro Tip:** Pair your furniture with warm lighting, such as soft [balcony furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor), to create a soothing ambiance. If you have an outdoor area, consider adding weather-resistant furniture with warm throws for those chilly but clear winter evenings.

# Spring: Fresh and Light Designs

As the world blossoms, your interior should reflect the vibrancy of spring. Choose furniture with light fabrics, pastel hues, and minimalistic designs. Add versatile pieces like extendable dining tables or accent chairs that can easily complement seasonal decor.

[Garden furniture store](https://beta.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/outdoor-furniture) often offer a range of spring-ready options, from modern patio sets to whimsical garden chairs. These pieces are perfect for enjoying your morning coffee surrounded by blooming flowers.

# Summer: Outdoor Living and Breezy Interiors

Summer is the time to expand your living space outdoors. Invest in durable and stylish garden furniture, such as wicker lounges, rattan chairs, and sun-proof dining sets. These pieces are perfect for creating a luxurious outdoor living area, ideal for entertaining guests or simply soaking up the sun.

Inside, switch to breathable materials like linen for sofas and cushions, ensuring your home feels cool and airy. Incorporate balcony furniture to set the mood for long summer nights.

# Autumn: Earthy Tones and Rich Textures

Autumn calls for furniture that reflects the warm, earthy tones of the season. Opt for pieces in rich browns, deep oranges, and muted greens. Wooden coffee tables, leather armchairs, and textured rugs can add depth and warmth to your living spaces.

For outdoor areas, garden furniture stores offer autumn-friendly options like weather-resistant loungers and dining sets. Complement them with soft throws and cushions in seasonal colors to create a cozy outdoor retreat.

# Year-Round Essentials for a Luxurious Home

No matter the season, a few timeless furniture pieces can anchor your home‚Äôs decor:

* **Neutral Sofas:** A high-quality, neutral-toned sofa is versatile and works across all seasons.
* **Modular Furniture:** Pieces like sectional sofas or modular storage units adapt to seasonal needs and decor changes.
* **Multifunctional Items:** Ottomans with hidden storage, extendable tables, or foldable chairs are perfect for year-round flexibility.

To complete your seasonal furniture updates, don‚Äôt forget the lighting. Balcony furniture and strategically placed indoor lamps can transform your space, making it adaptable to both seasonal and functional needs.

# Shop Smart for Seasonal Furniture

Finding the perfect furniture for every season is all about balance. Look for quality, style, and functionality to ensure your investment lasts year after year. Whether you‚Äôre shopping for luxurious home furniture or browsing a garden furniture store for outdoor essentials, keep your seasonal goals in mind.

With the right pieces, your home can effortlessly transition through the seasons, staying stylish, comfortable, and uniquely yours.

I want to stop being lazy and putting off working out. I'm slowly going back to the gym and making steps to form habits. My biggest issue is eating. Not only am I over eating, but I can't even really change the food I intake, I just calorie count to do something. 

Where I work, they have contracted out a cheif/ catering type company. A lot of there foods are deep fried or greasy so other people where I work want to eat the food. While there is other options, it is literally the same thing with no varity, but somehow not even good or consistent. Most days they provide grilled chicken, it's probably four days of the week. When they do provide it, it is a 50/50 shot it's not dry. I know the cooks work hard but they're not even consistent. When it comes to grains, there's no options even for Rice.  It's constantly white rice but not cooked all the way, where a few times it being crunchy when you bite into it. 

Also due to where I work, we're are given personal rooms. We are not permitted to get hotels or apartments if you are not on PTO. They claim it's because we need to be ready to head into work for emergencies within 30 mins. We're not allowed refrigerators, microwaves, any type of oven or toaster, hot plates, or basically anything with a heating element or something to cook with. They are also trying to currently ban coffee makers that aren't pod typed due to the heating element underneath. 

All around me is fast food and I stated before, to break habits, I don't want to go to any of them. Even if it's eating better options on the menu, I want to stay away from fast food to not cause temptation. Also I don't want to go out to restaurants every day.  I work 12 hour days, for 6 days straight and get two days off, so whenever I am off, I don't want my limited time to now conflict with me trying to work out, shower, study, chores, and just try to be a little bit more proactive. 

My question is other than calorie count, what do yall recommend to eat that can be stored in tubs or room temp that doesn't require kitchen equipment and allows me to eat better? Thank you in advance!",1,1733131871.0,mealprep,3,1.0,False

She lives in Mexico and I live in the U.S. so I don‚Äôt know about everything that went on while she was there. I‚Äôve been staying with and helping care for her for the past month.  

My grandma told me they had her on a liquid diet for the 3 days she was in the hospital and that she hasn‚Äôt had an appetite ever since. My grandpa passed away from a heart attack about a week before she was hospitalized. So she‚Äôs definitely severely depressed as she‚Äôs stopped doing nearly everything she enjoyed. 

She has a lot of other health problems, but she‚Äôs always had a good appetite. She complains about feeling nauseous often and when we went to see her doctor he explained to her that a big part of it is because she‚Äôs taking a lot of meds, but not eating enough, other than that he wasn‚Äôt very helpful, because he said to try not to push her to eat more than she‚Äôs willing to, but I‚Äôm very concerned. 

The only things she‚Äôs been eating are a couple cookies with coffee (I found her a chicory root blend that has no caffeine and she really liked it) in the morning with her pills. Some fruit, a scrambled egg or an Ensure around noon, she doesn‚Äôt have dinner often but when she does, she‚Äôll ask for a fruit smoothie and she‚Äôll drink a very small amount. She won‚Äôt eat anything else no matter what we offer her. 

I just ordered her an unflavored plant based protein powder and I‚Äôm gonna try to put it in a smoothie and see if I can get her to just sip on it throughout the day. I can‚Äôt think of what more to do right now, so any help/ideas are very much appreciated.",2,1733131870.0,eldercare,0,1.0,False

Just a quick question for those who live in the city and have experience with expenses, such as meals at restaurants, coffee, Uber, transit, among others. How much money should I budget for two weeks in Seattle?

My accommodation is covered (living with a friend) and I have already budgeted gas and parking (driving down). So, my main concern is how much money will I need for spending? Nothing too extravagant just sightseeing, trying a good restaurant, and using transit mainly. Things you would recommend I check out (ideally free, haha!)? Restaurants or cafes you think are a must visit? Anything else? I'll be there end of this month through Christmas. Suggestions welcome!

I think my main issue is finding it hard to judge the number of calories in things like a bakery almond croissant / falafel wraps in a food market etc (two favourite foods of mine and two that i find very hard to resist)... so my question really is how do you find the balance of indulging whilst also staying on track?

Was great up until it wasn't - died once, Breville reluctantly fixed it under warranty, took forever to fix, then either the courier or Breville damaged it cosmetically while it was out for repair and neither would accept responsibility.

It's now died again with electrical issues and steam failure, which seems to be a known problem. I'm in Australia so under our consumer laws I can push for warranty but it's either going to be a fight with Breville or pay a few hundred to have it fixed externally and I don't think I could be bothered given the quality issues I've already had. 

So my non-coffee drinking wifey has suggested getting a new machine and something decent. Obviously Breville is off the list.

Location as I mentioned is Australia.

Budget is preferably around $2500AUD, but could go up to $3500 if it's something special.

I drink primarily double/triple/quad shot lattes, cortados, double machiattos and the occasional espresso shot, so steaming is a must.

The other primary requirement is a short heat-up time so I can make coffee while my little gremlin has breakfast. I usually make 3ish coffees a day.

I will occasionally make 3-4 coffees in a row for visitors  but this ability is not essential.

I have a Compak E10 grinder and am fairly proficient in dialing in grind size etc. I can use a commercial machine under duress but not a barista. I have limited interest in experimenting with temps, pressure etc although the ability to do this in the future would be nice.

Counter space is not really an issue although the BDB was a nice size.

I have been considering:
- Acaso Steel Duo PID and Duo Plus - currently my top contenders
- Rocket Appartamento - my favourite looking one by far and probably second from top choice
- Bellezza Bellona - I quite like the idea of the external tank
- Lelit Mara X and Bianca 
- Profitec Pro - I don't know much about these or which model I should be looking at

A small and dumb part of my monkey brain says toss all these and get a La Pavoni lever because I've always loved the look so feel free to talk me into/out of that as well.

1h4qsvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureRoblox/comments/1h4qsvs/trying_to_understand_the_current_drama_going_on/,trying to understand the current drama going on (mentions of a pedo),"drama has once more entered the Pressure community and oh boy is there a butt-load now! this post is going over all the drama I've learned so far and if they have evidence/information backing the claims up. don't take all of  this for granted fully! there will also be links to any posts that are evidence/information/claims as well to personally look into. if the mods of this reddit block this post I 100% understand and respect the descision.

first off, I'm gonna knock out the drama involving or mentioning Zerum to get that out of the way. the first piece of drama is friends of Zerum and pressure mods harrassing self shippers, jokers and non jokers, that ship themselves with sebastian by threatening to leak out literal personal pirvate information online. there is one piece of evidence I was able to find on twitter (I refuse to call it X) this is the post created by the user Zachyarts who posted screenshots of Zeal  he quote ""sees no evil in the community"" and he in Zachys words 'commented under the evil' [https://x.com/zachyarts/status/1863374116390129831](https://x.com/zachyarts/status/1863374116390129831) I don't have anything that points to Zerum fully part with this or if this really is friends of Zerum or Pressure mods but if someone finds evidence of Zerum being part of this or even supporting this happening to self shippers then that's a new low for even them. yes some Sebastian fans threatened her and doxxed her but in both cases with the doxxing it's not okay either way, if you dox someone that doxxed you the situation only gets worse.

next is a claim or rather an observation made again by Zachyarts which is their observations from the pressure discord and Zerum on it, they posted a screenshot of everything they observed and summed up. [https://x.com/zachyarts/status/1861917247838580772](https://x.com/zachyarts/status/1861917247838580772)  basically doesn't give two fricks about and purposely drawed attention to the ring before the friendly fire update and making sure the ring is drawn on live streams involving sebastian while also telling sebastian fans to 'cope' and just wow. again this looks more like a claim and an observation so don't fully take this to mind unless more people who also observed this agree on this. Zachyarts also made another post following this [https://x.com/zachyarts/status/1862036536440549887](https://x.com/zachyarts/status/1862036536440549887) which some could somehow take as Zerum supporting the harrassment and possible doxxing but again don't trust this fully!

the last bit of drama involving or mentioning Zerum is a claim that I haven't seen or found evidence about yet, and it involves Sebastians VA. according to some claims Gianni is thinking of stepping down in voice acting for Sebastian and any roblox games after Zerum sent him some voicelines that made him uncomfortable. again there's no evidence I could find about this so for now it's merely a claim and I have questions about this. first if this really is true why did Zerum of all people give him voice lines?? isn't there someone else that does it? and were the voice lines made by Zerum herself because if so what was written that made Gianni uncomfortable?? imagine being in love with a character you made and kinda obsesed over and you end up being the reason the va of said character ultimately quits because of voice lines you gave or wrote? I have checked Giannis twitter and I haven't seen anything regarding this claim despite some claims saying he has, if there is I'd love to find the post about it but otherwise we could say this is a false claim used to rile up the community since it riled me up a bit. now that's all the Zerum drama I have and am aware of, onto the remaining drama.

also someone also claims Zerum made 'grape' art of l0l!con with their oc and sebastian and apparently it wasn't the first time and there was proof until Zerums 'white knights aka the people that threaten with doxxing info out' told them to remove it, again take this with a grain of salt.

now we focus on the Pressure discord, Zeal and the mods of the discord itself. going back to the first bit of Zerum drama Zeal made a post about how he quote on quote 'sees no evil' in the community and the discord as a whole 'no one told me' when Zeal literally commented the post where someone got threatened with doxxing after making a rant on Zerum. Zeal DOES see the evil and didn't do much to try and fix it other than saying 'what the F?' on the post. and to add onto the this the discord apparently is normalising Homophobia after a joke Zeal said like 'Mr Lopee is homophobic' and such and the evidence to that is by once again Zachyarts! [https://x.com/zachyarts/status/1862529198738276436](https://x.com/zachyarts/status/1862529198738276436) this wasn't really funny and now people think it's normal in the discord Zeal and pressure mods. another post was made by Zachy arts showing the people of the Pressure discord and the post was resposted by Savella\_silver [https://x.com/savella\_silver/status/1862624875426250943](https://x.com/savella_silver/status/1862624875426250943) showing how the community on there has gotten which yikes! as a member of this reddit I'm glad we're not that bad. funnily enough sometimes between communities of the same interest on discord and reddit only one is usually better with its members.

now when Zeal mentioned no one told him about the doxxing drama there was a reason, some of the people threatening to dox were mods! and there were times the victims may have been minors who were afraid if they'd speak up they'd be given consequences! only now are they speaking out. two post threads explaining this are from Coffeeteaslice [https://x.com/CoffeeTeaSlice/status/1862902499549516154](https://x.com/CoffeeTeaSlice/status/1862902499549516154) and Pressurestrug [https://x.com/PressureStrug/status/1863285506177482920](https://x.com/PressureStrug/status/1863285506177482920) and from Strugs post thread its blatantly obvious that people did try to tell but their calls about the discord and fandoms issues were left unanswered by the mods and Zeal themselves. I hear now they're trying to fix it but as they say 'the damage is done' and sometimes that damage can't be fixed or forgotten no matter how hard you try. Zeal said mods couldn't constantly be on the discord 24/7 and that's understandable but they could've at the very least acknowledged it and tried to fix the issues when they could. I think most people can agree once a project gets merchandise like the Sebastian plush then that team and project become a business with people being paid to work on the project. actions can have consequences and the consequences happened with people stating their harrassment by the fandom and the fear they had of speaking up. Zeal and the mods cannot really run from this and how they didn't do much or anything to stop the members of their own community on a discord.

last piece of drama which I have not found any evidence about is Zeal being friends a PDF-file and being aware the friend was one. again if there is post or evidence proving this then I'll add it all here if someone tells me or gives me a link to it but for now we can say this is a false claim or a claim that need proof or needs evidence to back it up. there's not much about it either so take this with a grain of salt.

that's all the drama I could find that's going on, if anyone has any posts or links that connect to any claims or parts of the drama I'd love to know to update this post. now if you excuse me I'm gonna try and make fan merch for myself of Sebastian Solace (and I won't be selling it bc copyright) but take these post that also have user talking about the drama as a whole or just their thoughts on the drama.

I wanted to share my journey and discoveries about tackling productivity issues, since I know many of us struggle with this. After years of trying different methods and failing miserably, I finally found what actually works.

First off, let's be real - productivity isn't just about working harder. I learned this the hard way after burning myself out multiple times. The key is working smarter and building sustainable habits.

One game-changing realization was that willpower alone isn't enough. We need systems. Think about it - how many times have you promised yourself ""I'll start being productive tomorrow"" only to fall back into old patterns?

The breakthrough came when I discovered James Clear's approach in Atomic Habits. This book completely changed how I think about productivity. Instead of trying to overhaul my entire life overnight (which never worked), I started focusing on tiny, atomic-sized changes.

Here's what really helped me:

1. Environment Design
- Clear your workspace before starting
- Put your phone in another room
- Have everything you need within arm's reach

2. Habit Stacking
- Attach new habits to existing ones
- For example: ""After I pour my morning coffee, I'll write my to-do list""

3. The Two-Minute Rule
- Start any task with a two-minute version
- Want to read more? Start with reading just two minutes daily

4. Implementation Intentions
- Be specific about when and where you'll do something
- Instead of ""I'll work out more,"" say ""I'll exercise at 6 PM in my living room""

I've been listening to Atomic Habits on Audible (you can actually get it free with their trial at https://athometouch.com/atomichabits), and it's perfect for absorbing these concepts while doing other tasks. The audiobook format helps me make use of otherwise dead time like commuting or doing chores.

The biggest lesson I've learned is that productivity isn't about dramatic changes - it's about small improvements compounding over time. Today, I get more done without feeling overwhelmed, and my stress levels have dropped significantly.

Some practical tips that worked for me:

- Break tasks into smaller chunks
- Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break)
- Track your progress (even small wins)
- Create a morning routine
- Set up your environment for success

Remember, productivity isn't about being perfect - it's about being slightly better than yesterday. Start small, be consistent, and trust the process.

I‚Äôm looking for a gift xmas gift idea for my boyfriend who‚Äôs a barista. He‚Äôs passionate about coffee and I don‚Äôt know much. He‚Äôs into personal designs on house made items. I was thinking of getting him a latte art jug. However, I wanted some with cool designs. Are ceramic jugs a good idea or no? I heard the tip of the jug should be sprouted and that‚Äôs not a promise with ceramics, but this one I found has a cool design. 

Or is it better not to give anything coffee / work related?

I generally dislike giving only text based descriptions but for a guy like Cameron who I play in a MUD it's kinda fitting.  I'll do my best to be as descriptive as I can but admittedly it's not easy for me to describe faces and body types.

Let's start with the face and his skin.  When you look at Cameron one thing you pick up are his eyes.  Typically, I describe them as an [almond shape](https://www.mouqy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/almond-eyes-slightly-pointed-inner-corner.jpg) in a [Grey-Green](https://www.color-hex.com/color/77926f).  You will notice on the left, his eyebrow and lashes are white which starkly contrasts the tanned honey tone of his skin.   He has freckles but they are fading, dusted across the upper cheek and nose.  His nose is described as [Castilian](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/utsw-patientcare-web-production/original_images/rhinoplasty_ethnic_600.jpg)(I hope that's a good example and the correct naming) with a high bridge and a bit of a hanging tip.  It's not wide nor overly slender.  His jawline is angle up but not extremely.  It's not wide and his could be described as a heart shape.(All this is open to interpretation as I don't have a solid image in my head of of him, either way his jaw doesn't protrude out.)

Of course another thing you'll pick up about his face is the vitiligo and poliosis pairing he carries.  As mentioned, his eyebrow and lashes on the left are pretty much bisected by vitiligo that encompasses his temple and part of his left ear.  I'd say it goes back to nearly the back of his head but all the hair there is white.  The bottom of the patch is hard to determine and truthfully it's growing in size as his depigmentation gets worse.  He has vitiligo in other places he doesn't mention but the most prominent one is the one on his head.

Now, he has poliosis in this location as well.  I'm aware the two things can be separate but in his case they go hand in hand.  His hair otherwise is a deep brown and wavy but he tends to keep his hair in a ponytail.  Not a super tight one but not loose and not really high up on his head.  Just a nice ponytail to keep his hair out of his face.  As far as length, when down, it reaches just past his shoulders.

And finally, the outfit.  He generally wears a long sleeved black shirt with a crew neck and black pants.  Shoes can be black too if you'd like.  If you want color, he's fond of greens and blues but he tends to favor function over fashion.

Expressions!  He's not very expressive, generally sporting a ""resting bitch face"" like he's perpetually annoyed but when he does show emotion it's very genuine.

Pose?  He could be holding a cup of coffee with his standard annoyed expression if you want ideas but otherwise go ham.  I'll say the MUD he's in is a sci-fi MUD and he tends to use a datapad(it's just a fancy tablet) to keep notes and things so holding that or reading it could also be an option.  He's an EMT too, if you can work with that.  Also, he's fascinated with space(ironic he's on an alien planet) so looking up at stars(or just something) is an option but I'd prefer to at least see his face.

He's a bit slender and stands tall at 6'(182.88 cm)... which is tall to me... I'm short.

And there you have it, I've intermingled a few examples in.  I apologize immensely if I've misnamed things.  He's supposed to have Latino heritage and I tried my best to convey that with a bit of creativity with his eyes.  My intention is not to appropriate any ethnicity or culture or misrepresent any culture here in any way.  If you need more specifics just reply here or send me a message(if I even have them on) and I'll try my best to clarify.  Thank you so much for reading.",1,1733128260.0,characterdrawing,0,1.0,False

This young lady left her friends to walk my ass around the mall ü§£ü§£ 
Got me to the anime store and she asked me a million questions about what my daughter would like and ended spending way to much there. Got me to sephora and got my wife the item she was wanting. Also got took me into a GNC so I could pick up some ashwagandha that I take.
I think I told her thank you over 100 times lol, she was a very sweet young lady and didnt have to do what she did. 
During out trip around the mall she asked me to call the wife and see if there was anything else we needed while I was out. Wife thought it was absolutely hilarious and those two had a chuckle when the wife came to pick me up lol.
As the shopping spree ended I offered to buy her and her friends drink at one of those coffee stands and we all sat at a table and talked for a bit. They had met up with us after GNC and thought it was funny. One of the friends states she was my seeing eye girl lol.
I told her again thank you so much youngin, you did me a solid. She like no problem old timer and went our separate ways.
I know she wont see this, but if you were the one that helped me again thank you. Didnt get your last name to look you up but hopefully you have a good holiday season and keep that kind heart.

1h4qcti,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1h4qcti/craving_stimulants/,Craving Stimulants ,"Hi all, for context of my situation I got diagnosed with bipolar at 14, I‚Äôm 25 now so been through a few episodes to say the least.

I‚Äôm struggling to figure out where I am at the moment, I‚Äôm not manic but I‚Äôm not depressed either, I‚Äôm not sure if this is a mixed state or what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is. My last episode was a manic one which ended in October, since then I‚Äôve been feeling very flat, zero emotions 90% of the time, the 10% I do feel is often sadness, I‚Äôve also been struggling with concentration levels, my head feels very foggy, It‚Äôs all been a very draining, and I‚Äôm struggling in day to day life being productive because of it. 

One major thing I noticed is that I constantly craving anything that will stimulate my brain, caffeine, nicotine and sugar. I‚Äôve been drinking a fair amount of coffee and red bulls, always seem to have a nicotine pouch in my mouth and the only time there isn‚Äôt one is when I‚Äôm eating the sugariest food I can find or put together, I‚Äôm chasing that small rush you get each time. Subsequently it is making me struggling to sleep on a night and get more than 6 hours when I do get to sleep. 

Has anyone been in this situation before? How did you handle it?

This is my first post, I just had to share! 

My girlfriend and I did the deed while she was free bleeding this weekend! And my god was it amazing. Having her blood all over me was such a turn on! 
The feeling of it getting sticky on our skin as it started to dry .. the smell ü§§
But mostly the way it looked! 
Leaving bloody hand prints on her ü•µ
I thought about taking it easy on her .. that thought lasted all but a second.
I fucked her so hard there were blood splatters everywhere.
She took it so well ü§§

And then the aftercare.
Sweet praises and gentle kisses for my baby girl as I washed and cleaned her in the shower, followed by coffee and cuddles on the couch.

Definitely going to be doing this again in the future.

1h4q9vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1h4q9vl/redundancy_from_sunderland_uni_unfair/,Redundancy from Sunderland Uni - unfair? ,"I am currently employed by Sunderland University in England UK. I have been employed for 9 years.

 The University informed staff roughly in September it needed to make ¬£26million in savings and had planned drastic cuts. 

Coffee shops have closed. Estates and facilities staff have gone. Car park prices have risen to ¬£6 per day and different companies have been contracted to give out tickets and to collect payment. This makes it near impossible to dispute tickets as paying the fee is often  ignored, thus, I have received two tickets even after paying. 

In September November it announced part of its plan was to make 1 in 10 academics redundant. That is 76 staff.
 
I am based in the school of health sciences. I‚Äôm an academic with a PhD in medical research from a Russel Group university. I have papers published in prestigious academic journals. I have a professional network across other top tier universities and in industry. I have roughly 18 years of teaching experience of award winning quality. I‚Äôm also the only tech expert in my team fluent in web development machine learning and AI. I am also business minded, therefore when student numbers started to fall in 2019 I was the only academic to respond directly to future needs highlighted by policy makers and developed a new business and innovation module. This ran last year and was met with positive reviews from students. I am also midpoint through several projects with innovation funders such as Northern Accelerator. Finally, I‚Äôm the only academic in a team of 14 on a lecturer pay scale ¬£38k per year. All other colleagues earn roughly ¬£60k per year. Many have no PhD or research. And don‚Äôt intent to. Over half are over the age of 55 and worked there for 20+years on ¬£60k per year. Several are lazy (other colleagues words) do little world and are complained about every year. 

I have not been to apply for senior lectureship as 
2019 my father died of the rarest brain disease in the world 
2020 Covid lockdown. 
2021 Covid meant a move to online teaching. 
2022 my manager placed me on a capability review. This is for academics who are struggling to do their job and is aimed at helping. When I returned to work after my father died she monitored my work closely (over 300 hours just one year online checking my teaching, often till 0200 in the morning.) she made claims that students had complained, when HR asked for this evidence she was unable to provide any. She was aggressive in meetings. Therefore, her boss spent 6 months doing the meetings. Each one consisted of easily confirming my performance was acceptable then 20mins of small talk. 
2023 I have carer responsibilities for my mother. This does not affect my job. However, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and fast tracked for surgery. I emailed my manager to inform her I may have to take a day off at short notice for this surgery and told her that I had made the necessary contingency. My manager ignored this email, in my absence told students I had not turned up and to this day denies I ever sent the email. However, it is in my outbox. My mother had surgery and was fortunately treated and the tumour removed with no spread. 

Since then I have continued to work strategically and help the University evolve to meet current needs  

Last week there were interviews where we were informed  out of 28 staff 4 full time positions needed to go. Luckily two people took redundancy. I felt my interview couldn‚Äôt have gone better. 

I received a call last Wednesday via MSTeams. At 10:30.  My manager read out a script stating I had scored last in the interviews and I was in the ‚Äúat risk group‚Äù and have a meeting with HR today therefore we should end this call‚Äù and hung up. It was 10:32.  

I have a meeting today at 1300. A union rep is accompanying me. We have requested the ‚Äúscore sheets‚Äù. Despite never having seen me teach I scored zero for my teaching. A brief look online shows videos recorded and edited myself, learning activities links to the literature and for other staff perhaps a link to some PowerPoint slides.  I would argue I am one of the best at teaching in the team and colleagues agree. Well over 2/3 of the team are in their 50s and declare they are technophobes. Students regularly state how they enjoy my teaching and complain about others. 

I‚Äôm perplexed as:
Other less qualified staff are on a pay scale twice as much as mine. Many without a PhD or research. And they are staying. 
Those staff (including my manager) are nearing 60 have no desire to do more than the minimum. 
I‚Äôm 42 and one of the youngest in the team. 
I‚Äôm the only person prepared to do media interviews and help with marketing and able to deliver persuasive talks as others ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like that kind of things‚Äù. 
I‚Äôm the only person who can read a balance sheet and PL account. 
I‚Äôm halfway through several projects that could attract millions. These need my leadership so could end up with competitors if I was employed by one. 

At the most basic level this makes no sense.   
Can anyone make sense of this. I‚Äôm extremely confused. ",4,1733127392.0,LegalAdviceUK,11,0.7,False
