I’m in the back doing dishes when all of a sudden I hear yelling. It’s after hours so nobody should be inside but my (not okay in the head) supervisor somehow let our barista’s famously abusive boyfriend in and he started hitting her. Anyways, I run in to yell at him and since I’m the only other dude in the establishment, he starts squaring me up. He does that stupid thing people trying to intimidate others do where he gets his face as close to mine as possible. Welp, he’s intoxicated so he ended up getting so close that he accidentally touched his lips onto mine. I respond with “bro did you just kiss me? I thought you were mad at me?” That really pissed him off so now he’s swinging at me. He’s hella drunk and I’m high so I felt like Spider-Man dodging his punches. Eventually, I knew if I didn’t do something, I’d get hurt. I really didn’t want to fight back because I know in LA you can get punished for defending yourself (gross but fun city so visit, just don’t live there) but finally I just had to end the fight. I knocked him out after two awkward swings and two gnarly punches right on the nose. Watched his stupid broccoli haircut bounce on the floor and the cops came to arrest him. 

Bad news, she’s still with him… low lives…

Good news, the district manager never bothered to get a security camera pointing at the only blind spot of the lobby so I’m like “I didn’t punch I just put my hands up to block the punches and his drunk ah fell by himself…” 😂😂😂 I got two weeks off PAID and my recovery doctor visits was all covered by the siren. 

I currently work a salary job that’s in the field I actually went to college for. I love it and get to be creative for a living so yay 😭 happy ending




SIDE NOTE: 
To the baristas that appreciate their job and every day try to make the vibes good with positivity, I love you, I want the best for you, you deserve better.

To the baristas that somehow think they’re better than others, judge fellow coworkers, ostracize free thinkers, and make the place even more miserable than it has to be I would just like to say, you DON’T deserve better, you deserve to stay in limbo and literally make coffee for people you hate. It’s why you’re stuck there and it’s why you’re sour to others. It’s crazy what people tell themselves to feel better about their current situation. You’re losers and I wish the good ones didn’t have to see you every week along with the customers whose brains are constantly getting worse because of how severe we are dwindling as a society.  I don’t care what your excuse is, please get a LIFE outside of the company. Please have hobbies, please CREATE things. Please actually look into small ways you can contribute to society because it’ll help you prioritize things differently and you’ll be a better person from the core, from within, from the heart. Or just quit and make lives worse somewhere else like 7/11 or something, it’s the same experience requirements you need to get the job you currently have. None.

I want places that are twice as good as those fake fancy places for half the price. If it's a cafe comfy enough to sit down and work then even better but I'll take any joint that serves great food at an affordable enough price for me to want to be a regular.

I figure if everyone contributes their findings then it will help guys eat well on a reasonable budget and support these places that keep prices affordable.

So I thought I’d share it with you all and spread my joy, as I’m practically still gushing thinking about it.

My girl and I first met in a book shop last year purely by chance. This random beauty struck up a conversation with me about the book I had picked up. This turned into a long conversation about books and authors, and me staring at her, mesmerised by how stunning she was. But I had no idea if she was gay or if I was her type. And when she very casually leaned in and fixed my lipstick with her thumb, it became crystal clear and left me weak in my knees. I was just the ditsy girl in her sundress and a fringe, and this angel disarmed me with quiet confidence. We exchanged numbers that day and set a date.

On our first date, we got some coffee, spent hours at the same book shop where we met, followed by dinner and a very, very long walk along the river. We held hands and talked nonsense all the way, and at one point she asked, “Would it be okay if I kissed you?”🥹

I melted on the spot. Being asked that question felt incredibly romantic. The hotness and warmth in consent is seriously underrated. I nodded my head and we kissed each other’s lips, softly, many, many times. And then she just looked at me, hands on the side of my waist and asked, “Still with me?” I just gave her a smile and looked at her lips, and she went for it. She pulled me in close, one hand on my lower back and the other on my shoulder blades like she was anchoring me to the spot, and it was a deep, intense, passionate kiss that seemed to never end, and I didn’t want it to either.

Needless to say our next date was literally a week later, and we’ve been together ever since.

That date was one for the ages, and we celebrate one year of love in the next two weeks! She’s from Spain and I’m English, and every time she speaks to me in soft Spanish words that I don’t fully understand, I melt into her arms!🥰",1,1749384742.0,happy,1,1.0,False

1l6anbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1l6anbn/concerta_and_straterra_didnt_work_what_worked_for/,"Concerta, And Straterra didn't work. What worked for you?"," Over the past few months I've tried Concerta, and Strattera to manage ADHD. Many years ago I also tried Wellbutrin, although this was pre-adhd diagnosis. I'm wondering what other options I should discuss with my psychiatrist? When I last spoke to her to implied these are the only options. I know this is not true, but I'm not sure what I could ask her about trying next. 

I'm also currently on 35mg of Amitriptyline for depression and anxiety. I've tried other SSRI and Snri in the past but I have a lot of issues with processing histamines (either I have histamine intolerance or undiagnosed MCAS) and these medications caused me a lot of symptoms related to this. The worst symptom was skin crawling/itching. The amitriptyline has been amazing in this regard, no itching, no skin crawling at night. I can actually sleep deeper than I have in years. However this doesn't fully address the ADHD symptoms so I wanted to try something in combination. 

My experience with Concerta was effective. I was productive. Starting and finishing tasks was easy and the steps to finish them seemed so clearly laid out. I was still able to think about the big picture and how everything is connected. However I noticed a clear increase in anxiety, paranoid thoughts, low mood (crashed pretty hard at the end of the day), and the itchy /crawling skin sensation returned at night. I slept terribly. I tried Concerta before and after adjusting to my antidepressants. Both times the symptoms outweighed the benefits. 

Next I tried Strattera. I was able to get things done. It felt good to be accomplished but my creative and big picture problem solving capabilities were severely impacted. This is a huge part of my job too so it actually make me slower and less efficient in some ways. I could only think one thought at a time, it was hard to consider everything else. I just felt mentally sluggish. What made me stop in the end was just how nauseous and sick I felt all the time. I had no appetite. I'm also hypoglycemic so I can't afford to not eat properly. 
I don't remember being itchy though, so that part was okay. 

My memory of Wellbutrin is a little fuzzy because it was so long ago. I remember taking it with another SSRi because after the anxiety and depression started to lift, I still wasn't feeling motivated to do anything. I'm now realizing this was probably because I actually had ADHD as well, I just didn't know it at the time. I stopped this combo because after a while I was too emotionally numb, and still had poor sleep because of my skin crawling at night. 

I can't even drink coffee because it gives me was too much anxiety so I'm really not sure what ADHD medication would be best for me considering this. I know there are other non-stimulant options to consider but I haven't heard of many people's experiences with them.

I'm curious to hear about your experiences with other types of ADHD medications. If you have a similar (and overly complex) brain like mine that's trying to manage anxiety, depression and ADHD, what worked for you?

* **He walked me home** on my first night at my new apartment even though it was out of his way.
* He helped me **find and move into that apartment**, drove me back and forth to the real estate office and all the related errands, translated the lease for me (im a foreigner and dont speak the local language that well), and used his car to move my stuff.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a **photo I took of him** and called it the best picture he has.
* He **cut my steak** during a meal when i just offered him a bite. When a friend pointed out that hes too nice to me, and thats why she thought he likes me, J just laughed and pretended to cut her rice. And he asked who else thinks that.
* He pays attention to the things i do or do not like. and he **proudly points out** that he remembers whenever its brought up
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants and i played along, J got **panicked and defensive**. J has done that a lot lately too, he's becoming more **worried** about me misinterpreting things concerning him.
* J and I were walking back to the office as another guy approached us and asked to talk to me alone, **J just left to go to his desk**. the guy then asked for my number, saying that he always sees me around. after the guy left, i saw J was at his desk with his headphones on, when i went to his desk they were half off his ears, he wasnt listening to anything on them. I asked him why he left me, and told him the guy made me uncomfortable. J's face looked shocked and shaky (i cant explain but it looked like he was suprised and scared, kind of how i look like when my heart drops). He had no clue. Then he called the guy creepy, and went outside to look for him and see if he was still there. When we walked back in, J told me ""wow youre so popular"" and as he was walking back to his desk, J bumped into the partition and dropped his umbrella and we laughed about it from across the room. 
* When J's friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up and looked at **me and smiled and tilted his head** as if asking ""Should I?/Do you want to see?""
* **- J's friends are lowkey in on it**, i feel like:

   * Another friend left us alone, smiling, while we were talking, even though he had just sat down.
   * His friend complained to me, in front of J, about how J tends to space out his relationships by a year. His last relationship was almost 5/6 months ago. His friend then asked me if that makes sense.

I promptly ordered all three, two of them in blind full-sizes (another rarity for me! But I was pretty confident about them, and with good results). For any folks newish to Arcana, I can give you the helpful tip that whenever they release a new collection (about once a month for them, though the collection sizes have gotten much smaller this year), they typically offer some sort of sale code or other promotion (such as a percentage off, or buy-3-get-1, etc.), which *does* apply to anything on their site, not just the new collection. So if you sample something, love it, and want to full-size it (and provided it isn't showing signs of going out of stock, because it might not be restocked), it can be worth waiting a few weeks to see if a sale comes along.

**My preferences:** I especially love snuggly scents, incense, golden amber, cardamom, black tea, beeswax, non-gourmand vanillas, and white florals (especially honeysuckle, plumeria, tiare, and tuberose; though sadly I am allergic to lilies and jasmine doesn’t usually work on me). I don't like hay, overly sweet gourmands, butter notes, excessive musk, leather, dragon’s blood, patchouli, labdanum, or any really dark scents in general.

\~\~\~

**Gullveig** \[Opening with a thunderbolt of coffee amber (resins of labdanum and benzoin with Arabica coffee and Madagascan vanilla), Gullveig leads you to a heart of cold ice cream and a base of warm lambswool and soft dry spices. A coffee-laced amber with gourmand notes\] - I was interested in this one because I love Arcana's amber (especially their amber single-note, **A Long and Elegant Nose** \[The opulent scent of a high society anti-heroine. Luminous amber, polished to a gleaming shine and set in gold\]), because this shares  the ice cream and lambswool - notes the notes I love most - from **Nectar** \[Ripe, plump blackberries and creme de cassis with sheer, summery georgette, cold swirls of vanilla ice cream, a tuft of tender lambswool, and a field of softly blooming sunflowers on a nearby hillside\], and because I had a (unwarranted, as it turned out) hope that the unnamed ""soft dry spices"" meant cardamom (and Arcana has some of the *best* cardamom). This turned out to be a coffee amber laced with syrupy caramel, with overtones of milk chocolate, saffron, black pepper, and French vanilla. The sugariness of the caramel combined with the coffee reminds me of **Poesie Coffee Goblin** \[Rich coffee drizzled with ribbons of caramel and sprinkled with an extra dash of cinnamon, a crackling fireplace, marshmallow, sweet pumpkin flesh enrobed in warm pumpkin spice\], while the rainy-day coffee vibe brings to mind the Sorce **Falling Stars** variants, particularly the marshmallow one. As it dries, the ice cream comes out, sweet and gourmand-vanillic. I'd definitely agree with the gourmand quality that the notes description names. I'd been hoping for more of the amber and wool; this is too sweet for me but I can see it being a hit for the many gourmand-lovers out there. As always, Arcana does a wonderful amber, and fantastically atmospheric autumnal gourmands. If you liked the recent **Tezcatlipoca** \[An opening of toasted pumpkin, bittersweet chocolate, and ground cinnamon gives way to dark heartwood, Mexican vanilla, benzoin, cherry infused caramel, and blonde woods\] or **Poudre Douce** \[Ribbons of warm, melted caramel are spiced with golden cardamom, Ceylon cinnamon, and toasty nutmeg. A cardamom-forward spice scent\], I think you'd love this one.

**Grimhildr** \[Almost a rose soliflore: a profusion of blood red roses with dark musks, forest mosses, black silk, luxurious amber, delicate woods, and our hand-extracted fir essential oil. A mossy, lightly coniferous dark rose\] - I was interested in this one because I've recently had good luck with rose scents in general (I can be *quite* picky about rose notes, but I think I'm coming to like them more), and because I'm absolutely *obsessed* with Arcana's silk note. This turns out to be a dark burgundy rose with black musk and a deep green evergreen note that reads like the rose's sharply thorned green stem. (And, boo, I don't actually get any silk.) This is exactly as brooding and gothic as I'd hoped. I really appreciate that this scent doesn't have any leather, patchouli, dirt, or oud to give it that blackened quality. For some reason, every time I sniff it, this scent calls to mind the rose of Disney's *Beauty and the Beast*. This will probably end up in the dark academia section of my autumn perfumes.

**Skadi** \[An icy opening of our hand-extracted peppermint unfolds into a blanket of snow, salt crystals, soft cashmere, water from melting icicles, white musks, ivory velvet, pale oakmoss, and crisp air. An iced aquatic\] - I was interested in this one because, like their silk, I absolutely *adore* Arcana's cashmere note. ""A blanket of snow,"" ""melting icicles,"" ""ivory velvet,"" and ""crisp air"" are clearly fantasy descriptions of accords, but I've had really good luck with their soft white notes before, so I was all in to try this one. And as it turns out: if you added peppermint - a bracing, winter-air peppermint, not a sugary, candy-cane peppermint - to **Moth-Like Stars** \[Creamy white amber, elegant cashmere, soft silk voile, salty Ambroxan, and diaphanous musk\], you'd get something very much like this, with its airy white amber, slightly salty ambroxan, and gorgeous, snuggly cashmere. There's also a white patchouli note that **Moth-Like Stars** doesn't have, clean and white-peppery, like that in **Eir** \[A sheer veil of gentle Roman chamomile tea, wild lavender buds, vanilla bean, warm flannel, ivory patchouli, and fresh coconut milk infused with petals of tuberose and magnolia\]. This is the snowy winter wonderland version of **Moth-Like Stars**, and an absolute success for me. I'm going to wear the heck out of this every January and February.

# Personally...

So in conclusion, my order was really successful! I love my two FS picks (**Grimhildr** and **Skadi**), and it's good that I only sampled **Gullveig** because as I suspected, it did turn out to be too gourmand for me. If you've tried these, I'd love to hear what you think - is your experience with them similar to mine?",1,1749384209.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a **photo I took of him** and called it the best picture he has.
* He **cut my steak** during a meal when i just offered him a bite. When a friend pointed out that hes too nice to me, and thats why she thought he likes me, J just laughed and pretended to cut her rice. And he asked who else thinks that.
* He pays attention to the things i do or do not like. and he **proudly points out** that he remembers whenever its brought up
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants and i played along, J got **panicked and defensive**. J has done that a lot lately too, he's becoming more **worried** about me misinterpreting things concerning him.
* J and I were walking back to the office as another guy approached us and asked to talk to me alone, **J just left to go to his desk**. the guy then asked for my number, saying that he always sees me around. after the guy left, i saw J was at his desk with his headphones on, when i went to his desk they were half off his ears, he wasnt listening to anything on them. I asked him why he left me, and told him the guy made me uncomfortable. J's face looked shocked and shaky (i cant explain but it looked like he was suprised and scared, kind of how i look like when my heart drops). He had no clue. Then he called the guy creepy, and went outside to look for him and see if he was still there. When we walked back in, J told me ""wow youre so popular"" and as he was walking back to his desk, J bumped into the partition and dropped his umbrella and we laughed about it from across the room. 
* When J's friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up and looked at **me and smiled and tilted his head** as if asking ""Should I?/Do you want to see?""
* **- J's friends are lowkey in on it**, i feel like:
   * One made space for J to sit next to me, standing outside the booth until J came and sat next to me, even though his friend is also my friend and could've sat next to me himself. that same friend also makes me sit in the passenger seat when J is driving in his car.
   * Another friend left us alone, smiling, while we were talking, even though he had just sat down.
   * His friend complained to me, in front of J, about how J tends to space out his relationships by a year. His last relationship was almost 5/6 months ago. His friend then asked me if that makes sense.

Signs he may not like me:

* He’s **deflected my invitation** to go walk by the river **twice**, first time he was hungover and sick, second time he said he had work, even though the second time he expressed wanting to go to the beach with everyone (but they refused because its finals week and the beach is far). 
* J asked me why i liked the river, and when i asked why he doesn't, he said the river **isn’t special** to him because he’s lived nearby for 30 years—but didn’t try to offer an alternative way to spend time.
* He showed **no visible jealousy** when other the other guy asked to talk to me alone—only commented after the fact and acted like he had no clue that this is what the guy was up to.
* He’s never followed up with **his own invitations** or taken initiative to spend time one-on-one, except for twice, once for dinner (everyone else was busy) and another to grab coffee.",2,1749383785.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1l6a8dh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l6a8dh,La Fortuna Guide Reviews,"My wife and I recently returned from a week long trip in Costa Rica.  We wanted to bring praise to Royvin and Richard.  Between the two of them we had three amazing excursions.  Royvin took us to La Fortuna Hikes and Trails, and Papi’s Place.  While Richard took us to El Silencio for a volcano hike.  

Both guides were prompt with communication, very kind, and incredibly knowledgeable.  We learned a lot and were immersed in great conversation as we got to experience La Fortuna’s luscious rainforests. 

With Royvin, we started with a sloth walk at La Fortuna Hikes and Trails.  We were able able to see several sloths, in addition we saw several birds, lizards, and it included a tortilla making class with a delicious snack.  We had a brief break break, we got some coffee, and then met Royvin at Papi’s place for a night walk.  The night walk included frogs, spiders, snakes, and moths.  

Royvin can be contacted through his Instagram, which is here:  https://www.instagram.com/royvin_naturetourscr?igsh=bXd6a3VuMTdrYXds

Royvin speaks fluent English.  So we had no communication issues.  

The next day we met Richard at El Silencio for a volcano hike.  Like Royvin, Richard is also very passionate about the natural wonders of Costa Rica.  We got some incredible shots of birds, and nature from this hike.  We also learned a lot from Richard.  Richard is a beacon of knowledge in regard to nature and animals.  He was great with assisting us capture some amazing photos.  Visibility was low but despite that, we were still able to see and appreciate El Silencio.  

Richard can be contacted through Instagram, which is here:  https://www.instagram.com/richardgarro80?igsh=ZzE0MTB6ZWNsaDg4
He also can be contacted through WhatsApp 
506 8656 4402

They were both also very helpful in capturing amazing photos of the landscape and wildlife.  I’ve attached several as a reference point.  

We found Richard via this subreddit.  And Royvin was referred by Richard as he was unavailable that day.

That daily iced coffee from the drive-thru, the emergency espresso shot before meetings, the constant need to ""reboot"" myself with caffeine? It’s gone. Three weeks ago I decided to take a break from caffeine, not for a challenge or a trend, but because I couldn’t keep ignoring the signs: headaches, poor sleep, short temper, and that weird jittery-but-exhausted feeling that somehow became my new normal.

At first, I didn’t think it was caffeine. I blamed stress. Or lack of sleep. Or my job. But I started tracking streaks and coffee spendings in the NOCAF app just out of curiosity - and the patterns were painfully obvious. I was spending $300 a month according to app data!!! I’d crash at the exact same time every day, no matter how much I slept. The headaches lined up with days I had less caffeine than usual. That’s when it hit me: I was 100% dependent.

I won’t lie - the first few days sucked. I had brain fog, irritability, and a pounding headache that just wouldn’t go away. I stocked up on herbal teas, electrolyte drinks, and started going for short walks whenever the craving hit. Having the app and written notes helped me track each milestone, and seeing the daily check-ins stack up gave me a weird sense of pride.

Week two was when the fog started to lift. I woke up one morning and realized… I wasn’t tired. I wasn’t cranky. I didn’t even think about coffee until I saw someone post a latte on Instagram. That was the moment I realized I wasn’t craving it anymore. I had officially broken the habit loop.

Now in week four, I feel genuinely better. More even energy throughout the day, better sleep, fewer headaches, and way more self-awareness about how I use substances as coping mechanisms. I’m not anti-caffeine forever. If I’m on a road trip or jet-lagged, I’ll use it - *as a tool,* not a crutch. But I’m done letting it control my baseline mood and energy.

If you’re thinking about quitting or even just taking a break, **do it**. Even if it’s just a couple of weeks. I honestly didn’t think I could function without my usual caffeine hits, but I’m clearer, calmer, and far more balanced than I ever was before. Download the app, write down on your calendar, whichever helps you - it was a huge help in keeping me accountable and recognizing patterns I would’ve otherwise ignored.

TL;DR: I used to rely on caffeine for everything — energy, focus, motivation. Took a break, used the Nocaf app to track progress, and came out on the other side feeling better in every way. Not anti-caffeine, but I’ve finally taken back control. Try the break. You might surprise yourself.",5,1749382611.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I am trying to figure out how best to describe this. This is the third time in the last few years. Today isn’t as bad as the previous times.

I did not wake up with neck pain, but a couple hours after waking up I’ll just be going about my morning drinking coffee, scrolling, etc. I’ll turn my head in a normal way (not jerking it aggressively or anything) and suddenly the side of my neck, down where it connects to my shoulder will hurt in a way that I feel I can’t turn my neck/head without pain. I suppose it could be a muscle spasm? 

In the past it has always happened on a weekend (just like today as I write this on a Sunday) so I didn’t bother trying to contact my PCP and I’ve always just waited it out and after a couple days the pain goes away. The first two times this happened the pain was really bad and I had to sit in bed in a certain position that didn’t hurt.

I might go to urgent care later but I don’t know if they’ll be able to do anything. Is this the kind of thing they could give a steroid shot or something to give immediate relief? I wish I could better describe this to get a better idea of what is actually happening. It just feels like it randomly happens",1,1749382427.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

When I go to a drive thru for coffee I like to get a coffee and a cup of water.  Usually I go to Dunkin because it’s cheaper than Starbucks.

But if Dunkin wants $1.50 for water, then I’m actually saving money by going to Starbucks!

I realize I’m probably the only one in this situation, but I just found it kind of funny that this seemingly small pricing decision would be enough to tip the scales in favor of Starbucks!  But for now, I’ll just go back to my regular Dunkin.",3,1749382384.0,DunkinDonuts,2,0.8,False
1l6a0sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/1l6a0sw/advice_needed/,Advice needed,"I moved into a new house recently in govan, and there is a lovely old guy i met who walks around our street every day without fail. He talks to us and our neighbours and walks around tidying up rubbish and playing with the dog and generally being a great soul.

Sadly through talking to him and multiple instances of stopping him jumping in the clyde we have found out he is suicidal, has no family to call on, and has had all his facilities cut off at home, so he cant shower, cook or anything at home. 

My neighbours make  him food every day, and get him to come relax in their garden, and if we see him and the neighbours havnt put anything out we ask hin if he wants anything and feed him/give him juice or coffee. 

Hes lonely, has nobody else and has been completely abandoned by the system to the point he has no support from anyone.

The big question is what can we do to help him? It seems like a hopeless situation, but we would love to hook him up with some form of support so he can regularly shower and eat and have a sense of belonging and somewhere to go and get the support he really needs.

# Part 4 – Cascade In Steps

 

On that first day, the very first in which he woke up and found himself in the wrong period of his life, Henry had thought “Finally, something good happening for some reason”. He got to experience the first positive thing that had connected him to someone, feel something fill up that void that had been growing inside him as he had grown into old age. But the truth had always lurked in that corner of the room, snickering at him, voicing the negatives in a mute voice that only his heart could pick up, all right, he had been selfish and self-serving in more than one occasion but that did not make him an actual monster, he wasn’t the only one out of billions that worked on the same principles, why is he the one being punished for it. This is just targeted harassment from Santa.

But there was something that had happened in his life that seemed to account as evil, if what he had thought was accurate last night, it might, just might make him an actual unfeeling psychopath, Henry thought back to the actual memory of that day, and started to feel a bit sick, and while he had his eyes closed going through memory lane he got startled to the sound of knocking on his car’s window. Henry opened his eyes to see Marco with a worried look on his face.

‘hey came to check up on you, Marcy called before her plane took off and said that you were not . . . well’ He opened the car door, and Henry felt the cold wash over him, bringing him back to his senses.

‘I’m in the mood for a Diner breakfast, you can drive’ Henry switched seats and watched him, obviously he would be hesitant considering what happened last night, even so Henry knew he would, and he did, they drove off to find the nearest Diner.

After parking they both got out of the car and as Henry was walking towards the door, Marco called over to him. ‘Why are you so calm?’

‘Just looks that way, come in’ Henry walked in and took the nearest table.

He came in and sat opposite, they waited for the waitress, she came over after a few mins, the place wasn’t that busy.

‘Eggs, Bacon, toast and coffee, thanks’ Henry said and waited for Marco.

‘Just coffee thanks’

When she went off to get their orders, Henry just stared straight at Marco’s face, he could see this was making him really uncomfortable, which was not the point of why he was staring, there was a coin toss happening inside his mind, and he was waiting to see which side it landed on, both sides were heads though.

‘You wanted to know, I am calm because last night is something that had already happened for me’ Henry found a glass full of sugar packets, picked two up and fidgeted with them.

‘WHAT? I thought Marcy was your first actual relationship?’ Marco replied surprised.

‘I mean being a really shit human being’

‘All right?!?’ Henry found the confusion on his face humorous, what was he thinking right now?

‘Want to hear everything?’ Henry asked.

‘Okay but I think you need an actual therapist for things like this’

‘Catching on quick huh? But you know something, I read that an actual crazy person would never know that he is . . . . Crazy’

‘Depends on the type of crazy’ Marco answered.

They both went silent when breakfast arrived, spent a few more minutes eating, the silence was calming for Henry, but before he shifted to another punishment, Marco needed to hear something.

‘You know people who cheat well? They have happier marriages and relationships’ Henry started surprising Marco, who was deep in thought nursing the coffee slowly.

‘What do you mean, cheat well?’

‘You know what I mean, they hide it so well that if anyone ever finds out, it’s usually when they are old and on a deathbed, I’m saying, if no one ever finds out, did it ever happen?’ Henry scraped a bit of bacon back and forth, it left a greasy trail, greasy trail of sickness just like him, Henry thought.

‘Is this supposed to be Schrodinger’s cheating, write a paper on it’ Marco laughed.

‘I don’t think that applies . . . besides that, I did that garbage yeah, and I justified it well to myself that there was no ounce of guilt on my conscience that first time, before when I wanted something I worked for it, I think of myself as someone deserving of what I find would make me happy, I will get it, well I will try harder than most’ Henry stopped, placed that bit of bacon in his mouth and looked out the window to see a young couple being handsy and walking towards the road.

‘…..’ Marco seemed to be searching for something to say, nothing seemed to be coming.

‘Cheating made me happy, I was really happy getting what I wanted, just like everyone else in the world, not so after the fact though, months and years, that thing, that I did, slowly eroded me and my ego’ Henry sighed, he felt cold and sweaty, nervous and sick.

‘You lack a moral compass and empathy?’ Marco finally found some words.

‘I am not a sociopath or a psychopath Marco, don’t insult me, at least I don’t think I am?!? When I told Marcy that I didn’t love her last night, watching her reactions and the hurt made me bite my tongue, I mean really get a bite in and fill a bit of my mouth with blood, so no, I am not one of those things’

‘Wait? Are you okay to eat man?’

‘Fine now don’t worry, moving on, when I think of people, I think you and Marcy are kind of weird to me’ Henry looked down at the plate, only a piece of toast left, he set aside the plate and started on the coffee.

‘Me and Marcy are actually pretty normal, ethically and morally compared to most people, I have these urges that you have, but when you decide to act on them thinking of only yourself and what you deserve, normal people, me, think of the people we love and resist these urges, nothing is ever worth hurting someone that devotes their life to a person’ Marco smiled, why is he smiling, proud of himself?

‘Isn’t living like that pretty boring?’ Henry asked.

‘No? Living a life devoted to someone and working hard to make them happy and in turn watching them doing their best to make me happy? That is heaven man, heaven on earth’

‘So, there is something wrong with me?’ Henry asked again.

‘Wrong? Maybe not, everyone has their own views on happiness, not wrong so much as hurtful to the people who care about you’ He sighed.

‘A few years from today, you are going to meet someone wonderful, pretty, hot and sexy as fuck, this girl you meet has a sick sister that is in and out of the hospital, things get bad and you come to me for help with money, at this point I would have been promoted twice and would be making an obscene amount that I can give this to you easily, but I don’t, instead I secretly contact your girlfriend and offer it to her in exchange for sex, she obviously takes this offer and dumps you out of guilt, Marco . . . you are broken and dependent on me completely at that point, in my head I have achieved two things I wanted, bang a hot chick that was out of bounds, got a friend closer to me, and then you get liver failure and end up at the hospital, but being a junkie as well now, you are at the bottom of the transplant list and die, I never visit you once while you are dying and instead spend my time at tourist hotspots around the world banging teenagers’ Henry took a breath and took in the confused absurdist look on Marco’s face.

‘holy FUCK’ he whispered. ‘We should get to the hospital man, you ain’t well’

‘Look at me Marco, I did all these things in sane mind and on purpose, I fucking loved every minute of those moments I get to be the bigger man, but you know, you died, and I finally found myself fucking lost with a rudder to the wind, happiness has fleeting returns the sicker you get going through life’ Henry looked to the left and in the reflection of the diner’s window he saw his face, stone and unfeeling, but inside he felt like there was no life, heart was beating, lungs was working, but everything felt empty.

‘But can I tell you something else? I think that person and the person sitting here are now are two different people, I think the point in my life I actually felt human was the point in which you died, you left me something, a gift to keep at my side when you died’ Henry stopped, he wanted to hear something from Marco, anything.

‘This all sounds very disgusting and cruel, but understand something Henry, I know you, we grew up together, you had a horrible, selfish attitude as a child’ He threw a bag of sugar into Henry’s lap ‘But I always wanted to stay by your side and wait for a day maybe you were a good friend to me, it happened, and I see you like now, understanding that maybe you are in the wrong, lets just work on this together yeah?’

‘Is it that fucking easy?’ Henry was baffled.

‘First and last time I’m gonna say this so hear me, I love you as a dear friend Henry’ Marco balled his fists for some reason, did that mean he forced it, didn’t mean it, or was it just hard to say to someone like Henry.

‘I’m sorry’ Henry sighed.

‘Welcome, now lets head to the hospital and see about that head of yours’ Marco got up and went to the door.

‘It won’t matter Marco, when I’m out that door’ Henry still walked with him, and when he stepped out that door, he was knee deep in water, holding a few coins in his balled up fists, they were digging into his palms, he was crying.

I weigh 18g 36ml out with a scale. In about 30 secs. It always tastes bitter. I tried shorter ratio still bitter. Coarser grind makes it come out under 25 secs and still bitter and dry.

Spoons is too important of a national institution to be left to the whims of the market. While they provide a good, cheap service now, what's to stop Weatherspoons from being gobbled up by foreign venture capital firms looking to make a quick buck? What's to stop the likes of Blackrock or Vanguard from buying up all the amazing Spoons locations in order to turn them into the next Starbucks? And then to start price gauging Tom, Dick, and Harry?

Spoons is one of the greatest national institutions we have in this country. And besides providing cheap booze, cheap food, and cheap coffee, Spoons acts as a social glue for many of the left-behind in our British towns and cities.

Tom, a 74 year old retired widower who's last remaining friends have either died or left his hometown, finds sanctuary simply being able to sip a delicious amber ale amongst peers in his local Spoons.

Dick, an 18 year old with his whole life ahead of him but who's Dad is sadly no longer in the picture, learns the true meaning of being a man who cares for his community while sipping a crisp, golden IPA, whist listening to tales told by his forefathers.

Harry, a 37 year old middle class lesbian barrister, initially felt uncertain about whether she would be welcome at Spoons (given it's outdated association with toxic male hooliganism) found that since nationalisation and the introduction of *Aperol Spritz Sundays*, has found solace having a **third space** away from her shoebox central London flat to be able to plan her upcoming week sentencing criminals and keeping the streets safe.

And this is the unique power of Weatherspoons: a third space away from home and work, where people can simply *exist*.

In the continent, they have endless cafes and plazas and sunshine to act as that third space.

In Britain, we have *Weatherspoons*.

Let's act now before Blackrock get their grubby hands on it.

After creating and testing 50 different personas for an AI audio platform I'm developing, here's what actually works.

**The Setup:** Each persona had unique voice, background, personality traits, and response patterns. Users could interrupt and chat with them during content delivery. Think podcast host that actually responds when you yell at them.

**What Failed Spectacularly:**

❌ **Over-engineered backstories** I wrote a 2,347-word biography for ""Professor Williams"" including his childhood dog's name, his favorite coffee shop in grad school, and his mother's maiden name. Users found him insufferable. Turns out, knowing too much makes characters feel scripted, not authentic.

❌ **Perfect consistency** ""Sarah the Life Coach"" never forgot a detail, never contradicted herself, always remembered exactly what she said 3 conversations ago. Users said she felt like a ""customer service bot with a name."" Humans aren't databases.

❌ **Extreme personalities** ""MAXIMUM DEREK"" was always at 11/10 energy. ""Nihilist Nancy"" was perpetually depressed. Both had engagement drop to zero after about 8 minutes. One-note personalities are exhausting.

**The Magic Formula That Emerged:**

**1. The 3-Layer Personality Stack**

Take ""Marcus the Midnight Philosopher"":

* **Core trait (40%)**: Analytical thinker
* **Modifier (35%)**: Expresses through food metaphors (former chef)
* **Quirk (25%)**: Randomly quotes 90s R&B lyrics mid-explanation

This formula created depth without overwhelming complexity. Users remembered Marcus as ""the chef guy who explains philosophy"" not ""the guy with 47 personality traits.""

**2. Imperfection Patterns**

The most ""human"" moment came when a history professor persona said: ""The treaty was signed in... oh god, I always mix this up... 1918? No wait, 1919. Definitely 1919. I think.""

That single moment of uncertainty got more positive feedback than any perfectly delivered lecture.

Other imperfections that worked:

* ""Where was I going with this? Oh right...""
* ""That's a terrible analogy, let me try again""
* ""I might be wrong about this, but...""

**3. The Context Sweet Spot**

Here's the exact formula that worked:

**Background (300-500 words):**

* 2 formative experiences: One positive (""won a science fair""), one challenging (""struggled with public speaking"")
* Current passion: Something specific (""collects vintage synthesizers"" not ""likes music"")
* 1 vulnerability: Related to their expertise (""still gets nervous explaining quantum physics despite PhD"")

Example that worked: ""Dr. Chen grew up in Seattle, where rainy days in her mother's bookshop sparked her love for sci-fi. Failed her first physics exam at MIT, almost quit, but her professor said 'failure is just data.' Now explains astrophysics through Star Wars references. Still can't parallel park despite understanding orbital mechanics.""

**Why This Matters:** Users referenced these background details 73% of the time when asking follow-up questions. It gave them hooks for connection. ""Wait, you can't parallel park either?""

In an era defined by ubiquitous connectivity, the simple act of joining a Wi-Fi network can often feel like a relic of a bygone digital age. We have all been there: fumbling with lengthy passwords, navigating confusing captive portal pages, and enduring the frustrating cycle of re-authentication with every new location. But what if connecting to Wi-Fi could be as seamless, secure, and invisible as the cellular service that follows us wherever we go? This is the promise of Wi-Fi Passpoint, a powerful and increasingly pervasive technology that is quietly revolutionizing our wireless experience.

This in-depth article explores the multifaceted world of Wi-Fi Passpoint, from its origins as Hotspot 2.0 to its intricate technical underpinnings and its pivotal role in the future of converged networks. We will delve into the security architecture that makes it a trusted alternative to open public Wi-Fi, examine its real-world deployments in airports, stadiums, and smart cities, and analyze the business models it unlocks for mobile network operators and enterprises. Finally, we will look to the horizon, exploring the evolving synergy between Passpoint, 5G, and the burgeoning Internet of Things (IoT).

# From Frustration to Frictionless: The Genesis of Passpoint

The story of Wi-Fi Passpoint begins with a universal frustration. The proliferation of public Wi-Fi hotspots in the early 2000s, while a boon for mobile productivity, brought with it a clunky and often insecure user experience. Each new network demanded a manual discovery and connection process, frequently followed by a web-based login form known as a captive portal. This not only created a disjointed and time-consuming experience but also exposed users to significant security risks, such as ""evil twin"" attacks where malicious actors mimic legitimate hotspots to steal credentials and intercept data.

Recognizing these significant drawbacks, the Wi-Fi Alliance, a global network of companies that certifies Wi-Fi products, embarked on a mission to create a more cellular-like experience for Wi-Fi users. The goal was simple in concept yet complex in execution: to enable mobile devices to automatically and securely connect to Wi-Fi hotspots without any user intervention. This initiative, initially branded as **Hotspot 2.0**, laid the foundational groundwork for what would become the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Passpoint® program.

The first iteration of this vision, **Passpoint Release 1 (R1)**, was introduced in 2012. This project established the core functionalities of automatic network discovery, selection, and secure authentication. For the first time, a user’s device could intelligently identify a Passpoint-enabled network and connect using pre-provisioned credentials, such as those from their mobile carrier, without the need to manually select an SSID or enter a password.

Building on this foundation, **Passpoint Release 2 (R2)**, launched in 2014, focused on simplifying the onboarding process for new users. A key feature of R2 was the introduction of Online Sign-Up (OSU), which provided a standardized and secure way for users to create a new account and provision their devices with Passpoint credentials directly from the Wi-Fi network itself. This was a significant step towards a truly self-service and user-friendly ecosystem. However, the widespread adoption of OSU faced challenges, leading to a more streamlined approach in later developments.

The most recent major evolution, **Passpoint Release 3 (R3)**, which arrived in 2019, brought further enhancements, particularly in the areas of network policy and operator engagement. R3 introduced features that allow network operators to provide more detailed information to users, such as terms and conditions or details about potential charges, in a standardized manner. This release also strengthened security by mandating support for WPA3-Enterprise, the latest generation of Wi-Fi security.

This evolutionary journey, from the initial concept of Hotspot 2.0 to the sophisticated capabilities of Passpoint R3, has been driven by a singular focus: to transform public Wi-Fi from a source of friction and insecurity into a seamless and trusted extension of our connected lives.

# Under the Hood: The Technical Magic of Passpoint

The seamless user experience offered by Passpoint is made possible by a sophisticated interplay of several key technologies and protocols, primarily defined in the IEEE 802.11u standard. Let's demystify the technical components that orchestrate this ""unseen handshake.""

At the heart of Passpoint's discovery mechanism are two crucial protocols: the **Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP)** and the **Generic Advertisement Service (GAS)**. Before a wireless client even attempts to connect to a network, it can use GAS to send ANQP queries to nearby wireless access points (WAPs). These queries act as a digital reconnaissance mission, gathering a wealth of information about the available networks.

An ANQP response can provide a detailed dossier on a hotspot, including:

* **Roaming Consortiums:** A list of roaming partners whose subscribers can connect to the network. This is how a T-Mobile customer, for example, can seamlessly connect to a Wi-Fi network provided by a different operator in an airport.
* **Venue Information:** Details about the location of the hotspot, such as an airport, hotel, or coffee shop.
* **NAI Realm:** Information that helps the device determine which credentials to use for authentication.
* **Network Authentication Type:** Specifies the security and authentication methods supported by the network.
* **3GPP Cellular Network Information:** Indicates if the Wi-Fi network has a direct relationship with a cellular operator.

This pre-association discovery process is incredibly efficient. Instead of blindly trying to connect to every available network, a Passpoint-enabled device can intelligently assess the landscape and select the most appropriate network based on its pre-configured policies and the information gleaned from ANQP.

Once a suitable network is identified, the next critical step is secure authentication. This is where Passpoint leverages the power of **WPA2-Enterprise** and, more recently, **WPA3-Enterprise**. Unlike the less secure pre-shared keys (PSKs) commonly used in home Wi-Fi networks, WPA-Enterprise employs the **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)** framework.

EAP provides a flexible and robust mechanism for authenticating users and devices. Several EAP methods can be used with Passpoint, each offering different levels of security and convenience:

* **EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA, and EAP-AKA'**: These methods use the credentials stored on a device's SIM card for authentication. This is the cornerstone of the seamless cellular-to-Wi-Fi handoff, as the device can use its trusted mobile network identity to access the Wi-Fi network.
* **EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: This is one of the most secure EAP methods, using digital certificates on both the client and the server for mutual authentication. This is a common choice for enterprise environments where security is paramount.
* **EAP-TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer Security) and PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol)**: These methods create a secure TLS tunnel before authenticating the user, typically with a username and password. This provides a balance of security and ease of use.

The combination of ANQP for intelligent discovery and EAP for robust, enterprise-grade authentication is what allows Passpoint to deliver a user experience that is not only seamless but also fundamentally more secure than traditional public Wi-Fi.

# A Fortress of Security: Why Passpoint is a Safer Way to Connect

In an age of heightened cybersecurity threats, the security of public Wi-Fi is a major concern for both individuals and organizations. Open, unencrypted networks are a breeding ground for malicious activity, leaving users vulnerable to data theft and man-in-the-middle attacks. Passpoint was designed from the ground up to address these security flaws.

The mandatory use of **WPA2-Enterprise or WPA3-Enterprise** encryption ensures that all data transmitted between a user's device and the access point is scrambled and unreadable to eavesdroppers. This is a significant leap forward from the often-nonexistent encryption on open public hotspots.

Furthermore, the robust authentication provided by EAP prevents unauthorized users from accessing the network. The ability to use SIM-based credentials or digital certificates provides a much stronger form of identity verification than a simple shared password that can be easily compromised.

By automating the connection process, Passpoint also eliminates the risk of users accidentally connecting to a malicious ""evil twin"" hotspot. A Passpoint-enabled device will only connect to networks that it has been pre-configured to trust, based on verifiable information from the network operator.

For enterprises, the security benefits are equally compelling. By implementing Passpoint, organizations can extend their secure corporate network to public spaces, allowing employees to connect automatically and securely without the need for cumbersome VPNs. This not only improves productivity but also reduces the risk of data breaches.

Who will rank the highest of the three and who will rank the lowest? Let’s find out:

**Episode 1**

*Claire* - **Mixed**

*Alex* - **Bad**

*Helene* - **Invisible**

Helene was barely in the episode. She got a confessional saying how everyone was panicking at the stall. Not sure what she was specifically in charge of to be honest.

Claire had a clear lack of control of her team throughout as PM. However she was completely correct in forcing the girls to stop selling until all the labelling and pricing was done correctly.

Alex was a poor leader overall. I’ll give him credit for being a good salesman but he told Nicholas to write down the price of £4.90 a kilo for the lobsters (which is obviously insanely cheap) and then after realising the mistake, he doubled down and argued with Nicholas about how it was solely his fault for the error which shows a lack of accountability and Michael specifically said he felt uncomfortable with the way Alex singled Nicholas out in front of everyone. He also didn’t recognise that Raef had identified some of the fish incorrectly either. There was also a clear divide in the team where one side accused Alex of being negative throughout the day.

**Episode 2**

*Claire* - **Mixed**

*Alex* - **Good**

*Helene* - **Mixed**

Claire and Helene secured laundry from some local businesses but also were a part of the chaos (along with all the other girls) in terms of running the laundrette and sorting out the finished laundry which was a total disaster as there was clothes all mixed up and some even got lost. Some may blame Shazia solely for this but I felt all the girls that stayed behind in the laundrette had a part to play in that as well. They also underestimated the boys as they didn’t realise they had already secured all the irons in the house which meant that the girls couldn’t finish all the work until the next morning which was a massive time waster.

Alex grafted hard in the laundry under Simon’s command and the boy’s team was able to finish all the work on time.

**Episode 3**

*Claire* - **Bad**

*Alex* - **Mixed**

*Helene* - **Good**

Claire was being exceptionally disruptive and rude to Sara this task. She also kept claiming that curries were too niché to go with for their special pub night as if Tikka Masala isn’t one of the most popular British dishes in every pub out there.

Helene on the other hand was very helpful in the kitchen and wasn’t undermining Sara throughout the day.

Alex was on the team that vastly overspent on the menus. However he didn’t really do anything else wrong and he came up with the name ‘A Taste of Italy’ for their special pub night.

**Episode 4**

*Claire* - **Bad**

*Alex* - **Bad**

*Helene* - **Bad**

Triple whammy for all three as they were all terrible on the task:

Claire for being extremely nasty to Simon the entire day as well as failing in her job as the link between the photography team and the technical team. Simon said she was trying her best and seemed to be attempting to getting the back room on track which makes me not want to put this as an awful ranking but considering that customers were getting the wrong orders and there was so much chaos going on, I’m not sure what to believe to be honest. I will say that Alex and Jenny were clearly trying to scapegoat her for all the problems though.

Alex for being a coward and ducking the sub-team leader role, lying about not knowing how much chaos that was happening on the other sub-team and for the mess ups in the back room.

Legitimately what did Helene do on this task? I’m rewatching it and I seriously don’t get it. All I see from her is sipping coffee all day while berating Lucinda repeatedly for messing up on the computer. Apparently she went with Lucinda to do the computer training yet she seemed to have absolutely no idea how to use it and needed an expert to help them get back on track. Nick even told her it was a very simple process. Not to mention why did she pick Lucinda for the computer role when she specifically said she couldn’t use them? Only reason this is not Awful is because I’m giving her the benefit of the doubt that she was making sure to follow the orders correctly to prevent any customers from getting the wrong items and her team did seem to run fine once the expert came in.

**Episode 5** 

*Claire* - **Good**

*Alex* - **Good**

*Helene* - **Good**

Claire wasted time trying to track down ingredients on the first day but overall I felt she led extremely well the second day, kept things positive when the other team appeared to have have secured the cinema’s contract and was a great saleswoman on the day so I’ll keep this one in good.

Alex and Helene both had the same roles on each of their teams which was making the ice cream and then selling it on the second day and they both did well in that aspect. I also get why Alex got annoyed at that cinema manager for making it out like he was the big cheese when in fact he didn’t have any power in the ultimate decision.

**Episode 6** 

*Claire* - **Mixed**

*Alex* - **Mixed**

*Helene* - **Good**

I get why Claire didn’t want to do the pitch as Kevin sprung it upon her last minute but she still backed the terrible environment theme for the greeting cards.

Similarity Alex also backed the terrible theme but hey he wrote some nice poems I suppose…

Helene had a short confrontation with Lucinda in the car, was on the photo team (which we saw very briefly I might add) and then pretty much said nothing else for the rest of the episode. Good tier here is extremely generous but the photos had no complaints so yay?

**Episode 7** 

*Claire* - **Mixed**

*Alex* - **Good**

*Helene* - **Fantastic**

All of Lee’s team gets a fantastic rating from me on this task. They all excelled and Helene is no exception. The best discount buying performance of all time.

Claire again was disruptive and interrupting Alex’s negotiations. On one hand they did agree to pretend to be boyfriend and girlfriend before the negotiations but on the other hand she took it a bit too far. She did however make some correct points throughout the day though.

Alex was the best negotiator of the losing team and therefore wasn’t really in any danger.

**Episode 8**

*Claire* - **Fantastic**

*Alex* - **Good**

*Helene* - **Bad**

Claire was an excellent saleswoman on the day and Nick largely credited her specifically (along with Lucinda) for their team’s win.

Alex was also a great salesman but was just let down by Helene’s choice of wedding dresses.

Helene made the fatal mistake of not letting only one team view all the dresses. If she did so then she would have realised that the Ian Stewart dresses had a massively positive reputation in the wedding industry and were a clear choice to go with. The loss had a massive amount to do with Helene here. She did sell some dresses on the day though.

**Episode 9**

*Claire* - **Fantastic**

*Alex* - **Bad**

*Helene* - **Good**

The tissue box and branding that Claire and Helene designed was very positively received. Claire was also massively praised for her amazing pitch as well. The loss had nothing to do with either of them.

Only credit I’ll give Alex here is that he had the common sense to include pack shots of the product in the advert. Otherwise the ‘Atishu’ box, advert and poster were all pretty hideous in my opinion.

**Episode 10**

*Claire* - **Good**

*Alex* - **Fantastic**

*Helene* - **Awful**

Claire sold the most supercar experiences by far of the losing team. In zero danger of leaving.

Alex sold £8,000 worth of the supercar experiences which easily carried his team to the win.

Helene sold absolutely nothing all day and kept making the excuse that she wasn’t a saleswoman so no one should expect her to sell that much anyway…

**The Final**

*Claire* - **Good**

*Alex* - **Mixed**

*Helene* - **Bad**

Claire and Lee overall did a great job in the final despite some hiccups with their gambling theme and simple bottle. She also handled the pitch and Q&A excellently.

Alex and Helene however was a different story. Helene was very moody the whole time and constantly picked fights with Alex which caused frustration not only amongst them but with their chosen teammates as well. I will say that Alex and Kevin seem to be the ones trying to rise above the issues and sort out the bottle design plus coming up with the brand name. Helene led the market research but came up with zero ideas and while she did make the perfume itself and it was satisfactory, Sugar also described it as a ripoff of the competitor ‘Angel’ perfume. Alex also did not factor in the costings when designing the bottle either which was a massive oversight. 

**Claire’s Final Stats**

Fantastic - 2 Episodes 

Good - 3 Episodes

Mixed - 4 Episodes 

Bad - 2 Episodes

Safe to say that the S4 finalists aren’t going to be placing very high in my rankings with these stats…

Ok Claire stats aren’t too bad I suppose. Helene and Alex’s though… even my lowest ranking winner’s stats were far better! Their spots are interchangeable. Helene had one more weak episode than him but Alex brought more toxicity to the teams he was in overall.

**Runner-Up Rankings so Far:**

1: Ruth Badger S2

Hi all.

Need some help and kind words please. Am going through an extremely rough patch with MIL. 

I've talked to my SO about all of this and can see she's doing the best she can, but so much of her life is tied up in the control her mother has manufactured.

Important info- we have lived together for a year and a half. My SO is currently working to open a small business and I'm taking care of cleaning/meal prepping/household chores plus doing some unpaid work for the business. SO has a mortgage for the place, which was MIL's choice of location and property. MIL fronted the deposit and has a contract with SO to pay that back. SO's credit card, which she applied for at MIL's request, is in MIL's name. She claims not to read the statements, but recently had a dig at our ubereats orders, so that is a lie.

I'm non-binary intersex, my partner identifies loosely as a lesbian. MIL refuses to acknowledge SO's queerness and would not use neutral pronouns for me if you begged. She tells SO that my appearance (i.e. gay-looking) is opening us up to violence, amongst other homophobic rhetoric. When SO came out to her, she said ""no you're not"" and she said ""I wish OP wasn't so agressively gay""

She has been asked not to speak poorly of me. In response, she told SO their relationship would deteriorate and tried to take our house (she can't, thank god). She was then told that we aren't comfortable with her staying here when she visits. Cue another freakout.

She has a lot of money tied up in SO's business, so we're having to be very careful about how we navigate her behaviour.

Her latest attempt involves flying down to where we live to go see a counsellor with SO. She sent me an email asking to catch up for coffee and go to an art gallery. After years of trying to meet her where she's at, taking zoom calls and phone calls and texts, writing letters and offering olive branches, working for no pay and taking her snide remarks, I said no. That I didn't have the energy and was focused on supporting SO. Now she's begging SO to just talk to me, just to have a chat. But I know what her chats mean. No matter what I say, she will take me showing up as indication that she has fixed the problem and how wonderful she is for having spent the money and time to see me. I've had enough of it.

SO says that I'm being completely reasonable, that as soon as we are able to extract ourselves from her talons safely we will, and that I don't have to talk to her. But I'm having trouble with the guilt. I'm having trouble with the feeling that I can't protect her. MIL's behaviour is despicable and she hides it in isolating SO and telling her not to tell anyone about it or else.

She's also extremely paranoid, refuses to write anything down, and will then claim that we're misremembering. I suspect that's how she's gotten away with it for so many years because my SO has ADHD and is not the best at recalling details. That's not a problem I have.

I just need some support. MIL arrives tomorrow and has two therapy sessions booked with SO for Tuesday and Thursday. I've declined to go, she tried to rope me in. I know SO will need me to be strong. She barely sleeps before meetings with MIL and comes home completely drained. But I'm honestly so scared of her showing up on our doorstep, punishing us in some convoluted way, or hurting SO. Hoping to get some strength from wise internet strangers. Thanks in advance.

Found out my wife is secretly messaging her ex boyfriend from
20 years ago


AIBU that I (40M) think it’s weird my wife (42F) still regularly messages her boyfriend from before we met even though we’ve been together over 20 years?


For context, her 'ex' (it feels very stupid calling him that when it was that long ago) cheated on her multiple times and she didn't have a good word to say about him when we first met. If I ever did or said anything similar to something he'd done/said she'd get all upset about being reminded. He sounded like a total waste of space.


They met up once after we'd been together about a year and afterwards she said that they'd done the whole 'it would be nice to stay friends' thing but really she had closure and wanted nothing more to do with him


A few weeks back I found out she'd been messaging him in private in hidden messages on her app (she was looking for a friends address and asked me to search in her messages and when I searched some hidden/archived ones came up). They were largely just friendly messages with him then occasionally dropping in a 'you were my first love' and 'I think of you often'. And then discussing meeting for coffee etc
I asked her about it and feel totally gas-lit by it. She said it was all innocent, that she'd never really meet him for coffee, that they'd promised to stay friends and they have and that I knew this (which is a lie and the opposite of what she told me)


She has a habit of being rather petulant and her manner turns a bit aggressive when she knows she's wrong and this is what happened when I asked her. I pointed out that a guy who can't keep it in his pants messaging to say he thinks of her etc only means it in one way and he has no interest being just friends. I asked if his wife would be happy about it and she went quiet. I then Asked if he was now divorced and she walked off.


It's also clear from the message trail that some have been deleted. So as well as hiding them, they aren't even all there.


She's been playing the 'im a grown woman and I'll do what I want' card and making out that I'm being massively jealous (I'm not a jealous person on the slightest I just don't like lies and hypocrisy and I know what she'd do if this was the other way round)


What would you all do in my situation? She refuses to admit she's done anything wrong and won't apologise

33 y/o guy with a cute smile (have been told so) with a career in tech ( but not a tech bro ), a calm presence with a life that has been a wild adventure of extremes, I thrive on intellectual chaos. I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot 

**What I’m Looking For:**  
A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

**The Vibe:**Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

**TL;DR:** Childfree, progressive, and insatiably curious?

Me, You can call John, we’d known each other since the 3rd grade and always been thick as thieves. 


The year this all happened, the stars had aligned, and we were all free for the Memorial Day weekend. So we decided to drive a few miles north of where we live to go camping in a small state park. 


We loaded up Tom’s car with supplies and grabbed a cooler full of hot dogs and beer before setting out, and by sunset, we were all ready for a great weekend. 


That was when he arrived. 


He was a tall, clean-shaven man dressed in a polo shirt and khakis who smiled like a painted doll. Almost at once, I noticed a bruise on his forehead that looked pretty nasty. He stepped out from the treeline just as we were settling down to eat and startled us half to death. 


It was a public campsite, but slightly out of the way, so we hadn’t really expected anyone to walk through. Still, he wasn’t doing anything wrong, so we just nodded and waved when he looked at us. 


“Hey guys!” He bounded over, “My name’s Dave, don’t you just love camping!” As he spoke, he stuck out his hand to shake, that too wide grin never faltering. 


“Uh yeah,” I muttered awkwardly, accepting his hand, which, despite the manic force he applied to everything else, was a limp, wet fish of a handshake. 


“Nice car!” He nodded towards Tom’s old station wagon, “Who’s it insured with?” 


“What?” Tom asked, somewhere between confused and annoyed. 


“I’m sorry!” The man, Dave, laughed. “I sell auto policies for Polidyne Insurance, can’t seem to turn it off when I’m not at work!” 


“Right…” Tom was looking around, bewildered. “So, we were just making dinner.” He left that hanging, hoping Dave would take a hint, but the man just blinked at us vacantly. We were all a bit drunk now, but still we eyed each other nervously as he sat down on the other side of the fire. The smoke was blowing that way, and he must have been getting a face full of it, but he didn’t show it. 


We all sat dumbfounded for a while before Harry reached into the cooler and pulled out a hot dog and put it on a stick. Shrugging at the rest of our dirty looks, he handed it to Dave and asked, “You want some food?” 


“Sure!” Dave said, his grin unmoving on his face. 


We all looked around at each other nervously as he cooked the sausage and put it into a bun Harry slid his way. “Do you boys have any mayonnaise?” He asked, looking at us. 


“Yeah,” I muttered, tossing him a bottle. 


“Great!” He exclaimed as if I had given him the meaning of life, “Mayonnaise is the sauce of the aristocrat, you know?” This bizarre statement was punctuated by him dumping an unpleasant amount of the white sauce onto the hot dog and proceeding to eat it in two bites. Leaving ugly white smears around his face. It was then, staring at him in disgust, that I noticed the bruise on his forehead was gone. That wasn’t possible, I rationalized that it had to have been a trick of the light. 

“What does that even mean?” Asked Tom looking slightly green at his table manners. Dave only looked at him and slowly blinked as if he hadn’t understood the question before swallowing the last bite of his sausage. 


“Look man” Dick straightened up, he had had the most to drink out of all of us. Which is probably why he’d let it go this far, but I could tell from his tone he was beyond annoyed. “We came up here to camp with our friends for a weekend, we don’t know you. So please leave” his jaw was tight as he spoke, and I watched, waiting for a fight, unsure if I would help him or pull him off  


Dave only nodded, looking slightly sad, and said, “Of course, I don’t mean to be a bother. If any of you are looking for a new insurance policy, however, you know where to find me!” With that, he walked away down the dirt path towards the rest of the campsites. As he walked, I noticed there was dirt and sticks on the back of his clothes as if he had been lying down in the woods. 



“Okay,” Tom hissed, looking around at the rest of us, “what the hell was that about?” 


“I dunno” Dick slurred drunkenly, a menacing glint in his eyes “but he better not show up at our camp again if he knows what’s good for him” 


“Okay Dick, calm down” Harry said placatingly. He’s probably just lonely. 


“Lonely my ass” Dick muttered darkly. “There’s something wrong about that guy.” 


I didn’t speak, but I knew what he meant. I couldn’t put a finger on it, but something about Dave had been extremely wrong in a subtle way. Not just an awkward dude who didn’t understand social norms, but genuinely wrong. 


“Did any of you guys notice he never blinked?” Tom asked after a moment's pause, and I realized he was right, in all the time he had sat in that smoke. He hadn’t blinked once. 


Hours passed as the fire burned down and the beer drained away, eventually leaving me alone in the early morning dark. Tom and Dick had hit the booze hardest and gone to bed hours ago and Harry had just left to brush his teeth at the small cinderblock bathroom a little ways across the camping area. I would have gone with him, but somehow I didn’t want to leave the camp unguarded with weird Dave around. 


So I was relieved when Harry came walking back into camp. Then, as he got close, I noticed how pale he was, as pale as a ghost. 


“You okay?” I asked, jumping to my feet, and grabbed his arm to steady him. 


“Yeah,” he muttered, “just saw something weird is all”


“Dave?” I asked, pointedly looking around as if expecting to see him grinning from the wood line. 


“What?” Harry asked confused, then seemed to shake himself, “No, nothing like that, it was some kind of animal, I think. I just caught a glimpse of it as it ran across the road. But it looked wrong,” I tried to push, but he wouldn’t or couldn’t explain more, and eventually I let him go to bed and started making my own way towards the bathroom. I carried my big flashlight with me in case I saw whatever had spooked Harry and played it around the campsites as I walked. A few tents and a couple RVs were dotted around, but mostly the site was deserted, unusual because this was a holiday. 


Then I saw it. Running across the road, maybe 20 yards in front of me, at first I thought it was a dog, but it didn’t move right. I swung my flashlight around and managed to catch just a momentary view of it, and I understood why Harry had looked so scared. It was about the size of a large dog and hairless. That wasn’t the creepy part; the creepy part was how it moved, almost spider-like. Startled, I stepped back, almost tripping when I felt a hand catch my elbow and steady me. It was Dave. 


“Hey, watch your feet. Don’t want you getting hurt!” This close, I noticed a few things about him, one was that his eyes were not only unblinking but dull and unfocused. Immediately, my mind went to drugs, which would also explain his odd behavior. The other thing I noticed was how cold his skin was. It was a warm night, but he seemed almost chilled. 

“Hey, uh… thanks,” I stammered, straightening myself. Before I turned back and ran the flashlight across the road. 


“Did you see that animal?” I asked Dave, not for any reason but because it was easier than standing there with him in silence. Less creepy. 


Or so I thought until he answered, saying “that’s not an animal” in a warning, almost urgent voice. There was something in his eyes that had not been there before, but only for an instant before the dull look returned


“Not an animal,” I stammered, “then what is it?” It had looked like, I don’t know what. Pink and fleshy was all I could say for sure. 


“I don’t know,” Dave said cheerfully “but if it damages your friends vehicle my company offers a great deal on all inclusive insurance if you bundle your home and auto policies with us” his grin shone white in the moonlight, as he made the rambling sales pitch and I had had enough of him. So, turning, I just walked away down the road. I made it to the bathroom and brushed my teeth, but when I went to leave the building and head back to camp, to my horror, Dave was standing right outside the door.


He didn’t say anything, just smiled at me, unmoving. In the light from the bathroom, I got a better view of him now, and instantly noticed that he seemed somehow bulkier than before. As if he had gained weight around his midsection. But that didn’t make sense, it had to be a trick of the light or something tied around his wrist under his shirt, perhaps. 


“What’s your problem!?” I shouted, fear creeping into my voice now. 


“No problems, we at Polidyne make insurance easy,” he spoke with the same faux-friendly salesman's voice as before, but he sounded different. Sluggish and slurring his words, almost drunk. I was sure then that he was on drugs. Angrily, I just pushed past him, walking back to my camp. When I got there, I crawled into my sleeping bag and went to sleep. 


It was probably around 2 am when I fell asleep, so I didn’t wake up until close to noon. When I did, I found the rest of my friends already up and nursing hangovers. 


Surprisingly I felt fine, I hadn’t gone as hard as Dick last night but I had kept up with the others fine. We had a full day in the park, and then one more night before we drove back, and despite how weird the whole situation with Dave had been, I was determined to make the best of it. 


“So, guys, what do you want to do?” 


“Head down to the lake?” Harry asked, gesturing with his chin towards a path leading into the woods a little way from our tent. 


“I’d rather hike up the mountain,” Tom said, shrugging, “but I’m good with whatever.” 

Dick just grunted, and took a deep pull from a coffee mug. 


A little worried after everything that had happened yesterday, I got the guys to help me load all our valuables into the locked car, and then we set off for the lake. It was actually three lakes, one roughly V-shaped and the other two like “I”s they appeared from a distance, almost like four claw marks in the earth. Which I supposed was why they were called the Bear Claw Lakes. They were cool and emerald green, reflecting the colors of the trees and sky and sparkling in the sun. The sort of place that makes you want to jump in and swim from just the sight of it. 


We spent a great few hours messing around, jumping off the rocks, and pushing each other in, and although around 4 pm, it started to lose its luster, it would have been a great day had it ended there. Tired, we began to make our way back up the winding trail to the campsite. 


The campsite had been completely trashed, as we stood dumbfounded where the fire had been the night before, and looked around at the slashed tent and upturned cooler. 


“Should we call the Rangers?” Harry wondered aloud


“No cell reception out here, we’ll have to drive” Tom said absently crouching down to examine a rip in one of the tents. 


“I’m gonna kill that damned salesman!” Dick yelled, kicking an empty can into the woods out of frustration. 


It wasn’t just Dick, everyone immediately blamed Dave, even Harry, who always assumed the best about everyone, but somehow I didn’t think so. The image of that pink fleshy thing the night before, I couldn’t get it out of my mind. It hadn’t been a dog, and I think Dave had been right about it not being an animal either. At least not a “wild” animal. I had only caught a glimpse of it, but what it had looked like to me was a person…


A person moving on all fours with something seriously wrong with their joints. I had never been superstitious, but something about that… thing had given me the heebie-jeebies in a way that had grown stronger the more time passed since I’d seen it.  


And that’s when I noticed the… thing, I don’t know what to call it, hanging from the tree. It was made from a beer can taken from our cooler, the metal cut and flattened out like a sheet of paper, then folded origami style into a small figure of a man, his limbs bent at odd angles. He was tied with twine at the center of a triangle of sticks and hung from the nearest tree to the campsite, slowly twisting back and forth in the breeze, the metal glinting in the light of the evening sun. 


The thought of finding and confronting Dave flashed through my mind, but what would be the point? 


“Let’s just go, guys,” I said, pointing towards Tom’s car. They all nodded clearly, uncomfortable to spend any more time here.  


When we all climbed into the car, it wouldn’t start. Now, in a story, this is where everyone would have panicked, but there had been a few other campers around this morning, and whatever was wrong, we all assumed it could be fixed. Or at least that we could get a ride to a mechanic. So we didn’t worry much as we opened the hood to check the engine. 


The battery was missing, and looking under the car, we found the fuel line had been cut,  or on closer inspection, seemingly chewed through by something. So leaving Tom and Dick to work on the car, and watch what was left of our stuff. Harry and I went to find another camper who could help us. 


But there were none, the campsite was completely deserted now. With all the other guests seemingly having left while we were at the lake. 


Both of us tried to rationalize and make excuses, but we both knew something was deeply wrong. 


It was getting late by then, and none of us had cellphones to try and call out. Even if we did, I doubt there would have been reception out where we were. So reluctantly, we made the choice to spend the night in the car and try to hike out in the morning. 


They all thought Dave was a psycho who was messing with us now, I still couldn’t shake that thing from my mind. Neither could Harry, who admitted to similar feelings when I questioned him. Though his suspicions still lay with whoever or whatever Dave was. I couldn’t blame him; from what he said, I gathered he hadn’t gotten as clear a view of that thing as I had. 


The sun set, and the night came in like a blanket, almost calm until around 10 o’clock, an ear-splitting scream broke the stillness of the night. It was a man’s voice, clearly in extreme pain, yelling and crying wordlessly, it seemed to go on for an hour, though it was only about 5 minutes, and then silence returned to smother us. 


“What the hell was that?” Tom hissed, looking around at us, just a pair of wide eyes in the dark. 


Nobody answered for a long moment until Dick exhaled a long breath and whispered “we’ve got to find them, they’re hurt” 


“Yeah, we can’t leave someone out there injured with that psycho.” Harry’s voice was shaky with nerves, he was clearly fighting to suppress. 


“Bad idea,” my voice was definite, and Tom agreed with me, but I could already tell they weren’t going to be dissuaded. So I did the good thing as a friend, and I ran after them. A choice I would regret for the rest of my life. 



We slowly made our way through the trees, our flashlights playing around the woods looking for anything out of the ordinary. When we found it, or more specifically, him. Dave was lying in a clearing about ten feet from the edge of the woods, his face twisted in a mask of pain. His stomach was split in a ragged line from chest to crotch with blood pooling around the corpse. 



“It opened him up…” Harry said in a hollow voice


But among this scene of terror, one thing hit me with a sense of pure revulsion stronger than I have ever felt. Leading away from him in the blood were dozens of small twisted human tracks, from what looked like very young children crawling on all fours. 


“Let’s get out of here,” I mumbled, stepping back from the clearing. As I stepped back, I raised my light a few inches and caught something across the clearing like a baby with a broken back standing on its hands and feet splayed out, insect-like beside it. Its hands and feet turned the wrong way, then as I watched, it raised its little head, mouth dripping with gore, and began to cry. 



Next thing I remember I was running, Dick’s heavy feet pounding the ground right on my heels as I sprinted headlong through the woods. Bursting into the clearing, my foot caught on a branch, and I fell hard, feeling something in my wrist break. I forced myself to my feet and kept running for the car Dick reached it and flung open the door leaping in, and I reached it moments after. Holding my arm as pain lanced through me, I turned to look behind me for Harry, but he was nowhere to be seen.



“Get in!” Dick hissed, his tone bordering on hysterical. I wasn’t listening, I couldn’t abandon Harry, I wouldn’t!



“Harry!” I yelled, looking around desperately for any sign of him, but nothing. Not even the sound of nighttime animals, and finally defeated, I climbed back into the car.


Dick was sobbing, and my breath was coming in sharp pained breaths 



“What happened?” Tom almost screamed turning to look from me to Dick and back again. He got no answer instead Dick swore slamming his fist into the back of the seat gripped by some type of panicked fit, and I was pretty sure I was about to throw up.  



“What happened?” He was fully screaming now: a mix of fear and anger etched on his face as he looked from me to Dick. 



“Something, got Harry.” I managed to hiss out between clenched teeth. 



“You left him?!” Tom  spluttered, clearly not getting how bad the situation was



“Opened. Him. Up.” We all went silent like a switch had been thrown, at the faint sound of Harry’s voice, but it wasn’t right, it was oddly blank and toneless, and the delivery was stilted and awkward. Turning, I could see him at the edge of the clearing holding his stomach as if he were about to be sick, then he seemed to shake himself and stand up straight, walking closer, I could faintly hear him mumble, “Opened. Up” 



Wordlessly and almost without thought, I found myself leaning forward and fumbling for the door lock in the front seat. 



“What are you doing?” Tom hissed, sounding scandalized at my actions 



“Open. Up,” He said, walking up to the car window and leaning down to look in like a cop writing us a ticket, only he was wearing a dirty shirt and smiling like something was physically pulling back his cheeks. “Open up,” He spoke again, almost naturally


Tom reached across for the lock, but found himself pinned by Dick who held his arm to the dash, crouched forward and shaking. He had a wild, half-crazed look in his eyes, and his voice was faint and breathless as he whispered, “That’s not him, man.” 


“Commmme onnn guyys,” Harry slurred these words from outside the window, then seemed to shift as he finished “open up.” His tone now totally natural, then he repeated, “Come on, guys, open up.” Almost perfectly natural, calm, and cheerful as he stared unblinkingly into the window. 


A long few minutes passed as we sat frozen, the thing that used to be our friend calmly looking in, as we waited. His speech grew more natural, and he started to talk coherently. 


“Real funny joke guys, but come on now. Just let me in.” 


“Let me in” He began to chant, growing more frantic with every repetition, that death mask grin never slipping an inch as he started to shout. 


“Let me in” 


“Let me in.”


“Let me in!” 


“LET ME IN!” On the final sound, he made a noise between a laugh and a scream and began to beat his head against the door until red blood ran down the glass. Then for an instant he looked confused, the smile finally falling from his face as he mouthed one word clearly through the glass, an instant later the smile was back and wider than before, muscles on his neck stood out and began to twitch under the strain as he fell back and began to writhe on the ground as if having a seizure. The word that he mouthed to us in that moment of clarity was “Run.” 


We all listened to our friend for the last time and scrambled out the doors on the far side of the car. Bolting for the direction of the access road that led out of the park. Or at least I thought we all did, but as I reached the last turn before the car would be out of sight and glanced back, I saw Tom on the ground, and something white, naked, and fleshy forcing itself into his mouth while Harry held him down. 



My feet pounded into the gravel road, and my chest burned with overexertion. The pure fire of adrenaline sang in my veins, pushing me beyond what I could do and into an area where I risked hurting myself if I continued, but I didn’t care. Dick was a few feet ahead of me head down and sprinting for his life as we passed the dark silhouette of the bathhouse and rushed towards the entrance of the campsite. 


We stumbled to a stop realizing we were not alone, a figure was crouched in the middle of the entrance, its head cocked like a curious animal as it watched us. The shadows of the trees played a camouflage pattern of dark and light across its pale, sagging skin, and a long pink tongue lolled from its grinning mouth and over one of its eyes, Its head was twisted so that they looked out from beneath the mouth, and a mane of dark wild hair fell from that to the ground. It didn’t move, just sat watching us. 

Dick didn’t say anything, just sank to his feet and began to quietly sob. I looked around for an escape and saw Tom and Harry standing behind us, slowly walking forward. Harry with a natural gait, while Tom limped and spasmed unnaturally, though even as I watched seemed to grow more coordinated. 



“Come on we’ve gotta go” I hissed trying to pull dick to his feet, but he had always been larger than me, and limp as he was it was like lifting a sack of wet dirt. 



“Wake me up,” He muttered incoherently as I tried to pull him to his feet, but all I managed to do was overbalance both of us, and we fell to the roadbed. The pain of landing again on my broken arm caused a galaxy of stars to explode inside my head. White hot lines of anger lancing up my arm and into my chest, but I didn’t have time to pass out. So I forced myself to my feet, swaying drunkenly as I tried to catch my breath. Tom and Harry were closer now, though the beast still watched silently, its crooked head giving off an almost bored energy. 



“Dick we have to go!” I shouted in his ear, but he didn’t react or seem to hear me. There was one last thing I could think to do, so I pulled back my leg and kicked him hard in the mouth. There was a crunch, and blood poured from broken teeth, but through the pain and confusion in his eyes, I could see his mind return. “Come on!” I shouted, grabbing for his arm with my good hand. Slowly, he pulled himself to his feet, almost bringing me down again, but we stood, and after a moment of unsteadiness began to move towards the edge of the woods. At first limping and then stumbling and finally running, we crashed through the underbrush, my mind using the pain of twigs slashing at my face to refocus itself. 



Eventually, exhaustion, aided by the realization that we were hopelessly lost, forced us to stop and take stock of where we were. We were alone in a tree-shaded hollow formed by two moss-covered boulders leaning against each other. Shaking from exertion, I leaned against one and slid to the ground, letting its cool surface ground me in reality. 



“Where are we?” Dick asked after a long time of tense silence. 


“I, don’t know.” I wheezed, my chest still burning and my heart racing like I was about to die from the wild run in the dark, far more exercise than I was used to. Hysterically, a useless part of my mind promised to buy a treadmill if I ever lived the rest of my mind condemning it for wasting time, which was equally useless in our situation.



“We’re miles from t’road.” His voice was sluggish and whistled oddly through the broken teeth as he talked. It was clear that even the few words he had said were torture for him, and I felt a stab of guilt go through me.  



“Sorry,” I started, but he cut me off with a shake of his head 



“Not impor-tant.” his slurred voice turning the syllables into separate words. Then he glanced around at the thick trees, instantly my body tensed, ready to resume our run, but walking over to a large pine, whose lower few feet were scarred by the horns of deer. 



“Look for road,” He mumbled, pointing up at the tree, and testing a deep gouge for footing as he spoke. 

“No,” I hissed, “It’s not safe.” He responded with a painful sound that I think was supposed to be a laugh. Slowly, he pulled himself up until he could reach a branch. Unsteadily, he yanked himself onto it before pausing a moment to catch his breath, then repeated the process, moving higher. I should be the one to climb; I was smaller and lighter, but with my broken wrist, I could never make it off the ground. Slowly, I watched as he faded into the shadow of the upper branches. The occasional grunt of effort and the swaying of the pine, the only indications that he was still on this planet. 



“What are. You doing?” Came a toneless choppy voice from behind me, and spinning on my feet, I saw him. 



Tom was standing a few feet away, smiling like the Cheshire Cat, his unblinking eyes slowly moving from me to the tree and back. 



My back was to the boulder, and the thing that used to be my friend was in front of me. I had nowhere to go, and the fear and exhaustion seemed to fade as a sudden calm flowed from somewhere within me. The realization that I was about to die was freeing, in an unpleasant way. 



“What are you going to do?” Tom asked his voice somewhere between a robot and a mocking tone. It enraged me to hear this thing, this monster pretend to be my friend. So as it lunged, I shifted to the side and pushed off with my feet. My broken wrist was crushed against the rock, and for maybe half a second, my world went dark. 



As my eyes focused, I watched the twisted-Tom-thing’s head smash into the rock, its neck turning at an angle with a sickening crack like firewood. It seemed to shake spasmodically as it collapsed into a limp heap at the base of the rock, and to my shock, I saw tears in his dying eyes. 



Then he screamed.



“John, run!” Dick was a few branches us now, and he screamed for me to run. But it made no sense. Why should I run? The feeling in my arm had gone beyond pain into some new, indescribable sensation, and the cool ground felt good against my face. Running would require an effort I simply did not possess. Almost lazily, my eyes drifted to Tom, and I tried to focus on him. Something was happening; his crumpled form seemed to twist from within, as blood began to stain his shirt. 



Dick leapt from the bottom branch to the ground throwing up a cloud of leaves, I heard a sound of pain, limping over he grabbed me, and as I had done to him before, he screamed for me to run. I couldn’t, my eyes refused to leave Tom. A burst of blood and some other fluid gushed from the wound to mingle on the ground as a dozen little things spilled out from under his shirt. They were twisted, half-formed abortions that screamed with a wailing cry as they flopped on the ground. Even so, this close, I could tell that they were baby versions of the twisted man-thing that I had seen the previous night, and had again blocked our way to the road.  



I remember that I screamed, but nothing after that for a span of minutes at least. Next thing I know for sure, that isn’t an image or sound disjointed from context in my mind, is that I was running through the dark woods, or quickly limping at least. I had an arm around Dick’s shoulder, and somehow I knew he had hurt his ankle jumping from the tree, though I couldn’t remember how. There was a knife-sharp line between seeing the dying baby things and now, where I knew I had lost time in between. It didn’t matter. Tom was dead, really dead, and as I stumbled through the trees, I had to fight to not let the grief overwhelm me. He had been my friend, but like Harry, he was gone…



Dick had seen the road close to where we were when he reached the top of the tree, and we were limping now towards it. Some distance behind us, I heard the sound of a… thing running full sprint through the woods. It was getting closer, but we couldn’t move any faster. Dick’s feet slipped, and his weight caught me and soon we were both falling, we hit the ground and rolled into something cool and wet. 


A creekbed, some small voice in my mind observed. I couldn’t even feel pain at that point, it was as if my nerves had burned away, just a distant sensation of wrongness told me how bad my arm was. Shifting from where I lay, I stared up. There was something warm in my eyes, and they were having trouble focusing. Still atop the bank, I could see the form of Harry smiling down at us. His shirt hung open, revealing the swollen flesh below, pregnant with more of the nascent things that grew in blood and pus. 



“Tom opened up too soon,” He said matter-of-factly, but nothing was making sense anymore. I felt stunned, I felt disconnected, I felt high… I felt like my mind had broken under the weight of all I had seen, and I was analytically watching myself go insane from behind my own eyes. I didn’t care.



Dick screamed, a feral inhuman sound and flung a rock at the Harry-thing’s head, it impacted with a thud and left a visible dent, but it didn’t flinch as the rock bounced away. Still Dick roared, until the rough sound of it made me sure he was damaging his throat, hurling anything he could reach in a frantic attempt to die fighting. I only shuddered quietly as I willed myself to my feet. Harry’s movements grew unsteady as Dick’s projectiles did damage to his dying… his dead body. 


I knew it was too late, I half walked, half fell up the other bank of the creek, my feet on autopilot as my eyes tried to focus on a gap in the brush where I could see a red, reflective stop sign. Two screams followed each other in quick succession behind me, one I knew to be Harry finally hatching, I could only hope that Dick had killed him, and caused the things to spew out prematurely like with Tom for a moment, because the hoarse sound of Dick’s final wail dispelled any hope. I could hear them gurgling behind me, like the random sounds of an infant and the chittering of an insect as I stumbled towards the stop sign, towards salvation. 



Beyond them, I heard another sound, a deep guttural growl that I could only assume was coming from some older, darker thing. I didn’t care, if I could reach the red sign, I would be fine. It glowed like a beacon even as the roar got louder. Then there was a squeal, high-pitched and unmistakably manmade, before everything went dark. 


The driver’s panicked voice as she fussed over me blurs into the sound of the paramedic shouting numbers as I was wheeled under some artificial light. A confusing slide show of disjointed images and words is all I have for what feels like a long time after that.



“Blood loss.” A dark figure looks down at me, momentarily blocking the light



“Severe concussion.” A stabbing pain, then a feeling of cool numbness flowing from it



“Have to-” Sweet, narcotic darkness…



I woke days later, in the county hospital, confused and in pain. They had taken my arm, they had taken my friends. I was alone. 



The police came later, time still wasn’t making sense, and asked more questions than I could keep track of. It took a while before I understood that they suspected I had killed my friends. I guess technically, I had killed Tom at least. Or had I? 

No!  That thing with the twisted head, the mother of all those foul infants, it was the killer, the monster, the demon. 


Eventually, they went away, and I learned later that the investigation had been dropped after the coroner examined the bodies. He killed himself, I think. Nothing much made sense for a long time, everything was still a blur of doctors and nurses and cops and people I don’t remember flitting in and out of my memory like ghosts. Ghosts, I am haunted by ghosts, my oldest and best friends taken from me by whatever that was. 


Eventually, my mind almost began to work again, and the doctors sounded less worried when they spoke about me. A few weeks more and they released me to go home. I called a cab. 



It drove me from the hospital up my driveway and stopped in front of my house, then it left and took me to the ferry terminal, where with just the clothes on my back, I purchased a ticket and left the island I had lived on all my life… Hanging over my garage from rusty tacks I used to hold up Christmas lights were three little metal figures, twisting in the wind…

Another classic UK day, which naturally means I'm well-caffeinated and figured it's a good time to reach out. I've actually connected with some genuinely great people on here recently, and it's reminded me how good it is to find those easy, authentic friendships. Always open to meeting more!

I'm George, 36, based in the UK, and generally pretty available for a good chat throughout the day. I'm looking to connect with a few more people (especially if you're in your 30s and can relate to navigating this interesting decade!) for those comfortable, everyday conversations – sharing what we're up to, our passions, and maybe even our slightly wilder dreams.

Coffee & Tea: Essential fuel and a simple pleasure!

If you're someone who values genuine connection, enjoys a bit of depth in conversation but also appreciates the lighter, everyday moments, and isn't afraid to share a laugh (or a supportive ear when needed), I think we could get along really well. I’ve had my share of good and not-so-good experiences making friends online, so I definitely appreciate when you find someone who's just real and on your wavelength.

I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend now for a little while, but i have been feeling this way since the beginning of the year.

I feel like he barely makes time for me, even the simple things such as inviting me over to his or going for a coffee, it’s practically non existent unless I ask him to do something together. Going on actual dates is unheard of - I could count on one hand the amount of times we have had an actual date such as cinema, or a meal or going on a trip together. On the other hand, he’s always making plans with his friends, and the majority of his free time is spent with his friends, gaming or doing activities such as going on trips with them - while I agree it is good to have space and personal time without your partner, but when he’s seeing them 4-5 times a week and never me it starts to upset me a little. At first I thought it was because of work, but he has a part time job and only does a couple hours a week, leaving him with a lot of free time. I got a new job recently, and it ended up with me having more free time, so I thought this would improve our situation but it hasn’t. Even after work, I’ll invite him to do stuff but he says he can’t because he’s busy, or too tired but then again he will be out drinking with his friends or going to hang with them. However, when I do invite him to do things such as coming to mine if it’s more convenient or doing activities he is interested in, he agrees then cancels or rearranges it, but then I find that he always manages to end up with his friends. A lot of the time, whenever we do stuff, his friends always seem to turn up - which at the beginning I didn’t mind but it’s rare we get any time to ourselves. It always seems to be things he is interested in when he actually agrees to meet up.

Even general communication is lacking, I will message him and send him videos, memes, stories etc just update him but he often leaves me on read, and the only time he will message me first is to ask if I’m okay, then when I reply and try to engage the convo further he just goes blank and doesn’t reply for hours or leaves me on seen. He uses discord a lot and I even downloaded it as my boyfriend said it would improve communication for us, but as of yet, it hasn’t. Calling is also non existent on his end, I try and communicate with him by calling or FaceTiming but often when I do this, he’s with his friends or won’t answer, or can’t answer if he’s busy such as at work. When we do talk, it’s often about his friends, what they’ve done, what he’s been upto with little thought on me so I try and make more conversation but it just falls flat.

Emotionally and verbally it’s lacking, but even sexually or physically, nothing has happened. We have been together over a year and we haven’t even had any sexual contact, or even had a sleep over at each others houses - we have only spent the night with eachother at a hotel together. I understand not being ready and we have had this discussion about it and the topic just seems to get brushed under the carpet - he’s not uncomfortable with his sexuality he even told me this, but he watches a lot of hentai, uses Chat.Ai sex bots and obviously x rated anime’s and videos online. I’ve even asked him if I’m the reason he doesn’t want to have sex, perhaps if he doesn’t find me sexually appealing - and he reassures me that’s not the reason but when I try and open up to him about his feelings and mine, it again falls flat. It’s just a never ending cycle.

I have voiced my opinion and feelings regarding these problems but he just promises to change and even admits he hasn’t made me a priority (even stating his mom feels the same way) but I try and give him the benefit of the doubt but I think I’ve had enough now. Just looking for advice regarding this. I have mentioned to him that I value communication in a relationship and he feels the same way surprisingly enough but nothing seems to improve and I’m left feeling like I’m doing something wrong or that he doesn’t actually value our relationship.

I don’t want to waste my time or his, and I’d much prefer him to end things if it’s not working out but he always says that he loves me and wants to be with me, but his actions say other wise.

As mentioned, I can value personal time and I’m not expecting 24/7 attention or anything from him because we are both adults with lives but even just once a week meet ups would be better then this.

## Key Features Analysis

The qualities of oatly ice cream contribute considerably to its appeal and overall user experience.

**Oat Base:**

The core ingredient of Oatly ice cream is, predictably, oats. this oat base provides a naturally sweet and creamy foundation without the need for dairy. Oatly uses a proprietary enzyme process to break down the oats, releasing sugars and creating a smooth, palatable texture. The percentage of oat base varies slightly between flavors but generally comprises a significant portion of the overall product.

**Flavor Variety:**

Oatly boasts a respectable range of flavors,catering to diverse palates. From classic options like vanilla and chocolate to more adventurous creations like coffee and strawberry, there's a flavor to suit most preferences. Limited-edition and seasonal flavors are also frequently introduced, keeping the product line fresh and exciting. Each flavor is crafted with natural ingredients and avoids artificial flavorings as much as possible.

**Nutritional Profile:**

Compared to traditional ice cream, Oatly ice cream generally contains less saturated fat and cholesterol. It is also naturally lactose-free, making it suitable for individuals with lactose intolerance.The sugar content,though,can be relatively high,similar to many conventional ice cream brands. Exact nutritional information varies depending on the specific flavor, so it's important to check the label.**Packaging and Sustainability:**

Oatly emphasizes sustainable practices throughout its production and packaging processes. The ice cream containers are made from paperboard, derived from responsibly sourced forests.

## Core Benefits

**Dairy-Free Indulgence:**

For individuals with lactose intolerance or those adhering to a vegan lifestyle, Oatly ice cream offers a guilt-free way to indulge in a creamy and satisfying treat. It replicates the texture and flavor of traditional ice cream remarkably well, eliminating the feeling of compromise often associated with dairy-free alternatives. Instead of feeling restricted, users can experience the pleasure of ice cream without digestive discomfort.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of plant-based ice cream can involve some common questions,especially concerning ingredients and storage.

**Does Oatly ice cream taste like oats?**

While oat milk undeniably forms the base, the presence of oat flavor is subtle in most of Oatly's ice cream flavors. The careful blending of ingredients and the flavor profiles themselves effectively mask any strong oat taste, allowing other flavors to come through prominently. The final product tastes very similar to traditional dairy ice cream.

**How should Oatly ice cream be stored to avoid freezer burn?**

To minimize freezer burn, ensure the lid is tightly sealed after each use. Press a layer of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the ice cream before replacing the lid. Storing the ice cream towards the back of the freezer, where the temperature is more consistent, can also help prevent freezer burn and maintain optimal texture.

**Is Oatly ice cream gluten-free?**

Oatly states some of their products are gluten-free, while others aren't. Ingredients can vary by product,so always check the packaging to confirm whether or not it is gluten-free. People with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities should exercise caution and carefully read the label to avoid products that might contain gluten or pose a risk of cross-contamination.

Took zoloft 50 in february, gave me the worst panic attack of my life. Tried to continue but saw no progress so quit it in March. Still had lingering panic attacks in late April even tho I'd hever had a panic attack in my life prior to taking zoloft.
Then I microdosed on Mirtazapine for sleep, just a tiniest bit of a pill to help me sleep. Last week I did it every day which was great at first - no more panic, felt great, until I had mild hypomania and could sleep 4h max, racing thoughts, felt warm and electric. Took zoloft 12.5 for three days, had a horrible panic attack again, discontinued. Now I'm on seroquel 25 to help with thoughts and sleep. 
But I still have symptoms like: bussing sensation through my body, pins and needles, muscle twitches, and the most frightening - the area under my left eye has been numb/burning for 4-5 days. It feels like eye twitching but at a larger scale and without actual twitches. Can all this be related to pills? Is serotonin that powerful even in tiny doses? Ppl be like noooo you took mini doses it can't be, must be coffee that caused panic, but I've been a coffee drinker for a decade, and only got panic after zoloft

1l693cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatelygranolamoms/comments/1l693cn/single_use_plastic_spoon_in_toddlers_hot_chocolate/,Single use plastic spoon in toddler's hot chocolate,"I'm just looking for some reassurance and kind words as I'm feeling anxious at the moment. For the last couple of months I have been reading about household sources of exposure to potentially harmful chemicals and microplastics and it has gotten me very worried (yes, I am quite late to the party).

I have a 3 year old and a 7 month old and I realise I had done some things with them that were potentially harmful (like heating food in plastic etc). It took me a few very upsetting weeks to process this and I have since made changes in my household and vowed to minimise their exposure to these things as much as possible going forward.

Today my family (partner, kids, parents and grandmother) and I attended a local art show run by a community group. After the show we all had hot drinks and my toddler had her first ever hot chocolate as a treat. The drinks were served in normal coffee cups/mugs but my toddler's hot chocolate had a single use plastic spoon inside it. My toddler proceeded to drink the hot chocolate by sipping it each time from the spoon. 

It's no longer possible to buy these spoons in my country (Australia) so I don't know how old these were. I wasn't able to take it off her without my whole family thinking I was going nuts (they don't believe any of this stuff is a problem).

I'm now just really worried about microplastic and pfas exposure. Do you think I have anything to worry about here? It was just one time...but I can't stop thinking about it.
Does anyone have any advice about how to deal with this anxiety going forward? I speak to a therapist at the moment and suspect I have some level of postpartum anxiety however it is a very specific kind, related to plastics and chemicals.

Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading it xx

1l69279,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/1l69279/unexpectedly_optimistic/,Unexpectedly optimistic,"I have been PTing at 153-158 and I know myself. Guys, I KNOW MYSELF. I know the feeling I have with practice tests and I generally have a good gauge of how I did. On the PT’s I’m confident in about 50%, have a decent idea for about 25%, in the right ballpark for 10% and guessing 15%.

I wrote LR LR RC LR. I got the chimpanzee, Suspect line up, RC version. 

I felt super good about this test. I finished most sections with around 4-5 minutes left. The RC was a breeze. Reviewed many answers and verified why my answers made sense. Obviously, I can’t say with 100% confidence how I did but I can say I’ve never, ever felt that positive about an LSAT before. I think that was the easiest one I’ve ever written (actual LSAT (1x) and PTs (16x)). If my feeling after my lowest score of 153 was a 30/100 score for emotion, and the 158 score was a 50/100 score for emotion, this one was an 80+/100. I’m not sure what to expect. I’ll take it with a grain of salt and wait for my score but wanted to share that with someone who it may help while they anxiously wait.

I’m excited to see my grade. If it’s a really low score, I’m going to laugh at myself really hard for having this kind of response. My best personal guess, 165-168 is my score.

For those still reading and want to laugh a little more, here is my routine prior to the test:

I wrote the test in a construction site office in a field office trailer starting at 7:30PM CST after fasting for 28 hours (ate 3:30PM the previous day as my last meal, been keto for 1 month straight - no cheats). I took a pinch of salt, a shot of olive oil, poured 2 bottles of freezing water on my head and drank really strong, light-roast coffee right before the test in a warm “room” that was actively cooling while I wrote the test.",1,1749378695.0,LSAT,0,1.0,False

  WELL, THAT DID KIND OF EXPLAIN THE nasty looks he kept giving me. And continued to give me, now that I’d brought him up to the loft. Not that I blamed him. It wasn’t like I knew what to say to him, exactly, and was nervously buzzing around, making him an espresso from our deluxe cappuccino/espresso maker, which Lulu had only recently showed me how to work. I wasn’t sure what else to do, other than offer him coffee, really. I mean, I’d never had a big brother before. Let alone a big brother who was really mad at me for losing our mother, for whom apparently Nikki was responsible while he was on duty. He didn’t seem too enthused about the espresso, but at least he’d finally accepted the amnesia explanation. Sort of. Lulu was a big help in this capacity. She’d come staggering out of her room (wearing nothing but a shiny peach-colored camisole and a pair of tap pants, with her hair doing something crazy because she had evidently just woken up, even though it was two in the afternoon—early for her, really) while I was trying to get the espresso maker to work. Lulu took one look at the uniformed man taking up so much space in our living room (not that he was fat or anything. He was just tall and muscular and…well, the kind of guy who took up a lot of space) and went, “Well, hell-ooooo there,” with this big smile on her face. I wanted to go, Not now, Lulu, because I knew exactly what she was up to. Lulu was getting ready to make Steven fall in love with her, the way she did every cute guy she encountered. Making cute guys fall in love with her was Lulu’s hobby, besides shopping, drinking mojitos, and occasionally recording songs for her record album that never seemed to get finished. But I needn’t have worried. Because Steven—Nikki’s brother—just went, “Hi,” to Lulu in this totally uninterested way and kept right on saying what he’d been saying the whole time we were coming up in the elevator together, which was, “Amnesia? Like people get on soap operas?” “Not exactly,” I assured him. Even though, from what I understand, there isn’t such a thing, really. Well, there is, but not the way Nikki Howard was supposed to have it. People don’t conk their head and just selectively forget some stuff when they get amnesia. They forget everything. Like their own names and the country they live in. Sometimes they even forget how to tie their shoes. “And you’re telling me you don’t remember,” Steven went on, completely ignoring Lulu, who was now sauntering past him in her shiny getup, which she’d accessorized with a pair of matching feathered mules, “that you promised to look after Mom while I was gone, make sure she was paying her rent on time and that things were running smoothly with the dog grooming kennel?” Dog grooming kennel? Nikki Howard’s mom owned a dog grooming kennel? This was information it might have been helpful for someone to have shared with me—along with the fact that Nikki had a brother in the navy—earlier than, oh, say, now. All anyone had ever said to me was that Nikki was an emancipated minor who hadn’t gotten along with her family. For this reason I shot Lulu a dirty look as she hopped up onto one of the kitchen counter stools—careful to cross her spraytanned legs so that Steven had as full a view of them as possible. But Lulu completely ignored me, all her attention being focused on the handsome blond man in the uniform standing in the middle of our living room. “Um,” I said, fumbling with the espresso machine. Better to concentrate on the coffeemaker than on what was happening in the living room, which was precisely what it looked like: trouble. Nice of Nikki, by the way, to have a whole drawer of press clippings about herself and not a single photo of her own family. “Up until you told me, I didn’t even know I had a brother. So, the answer is no, I don’t remember telling you that. Or about Mom and her dog grooming business, either, for that matter. ” “So what rank are you?” Lulu wanted to know, her gaze raking Steven’s buff form as he stood with his arms crossed, consequently making his biceps bulge a little beneath his uniform. Lulu couldn’t seem to keep her foot from jiggling, and this was causing one of her feathered mules to bobble up and down in a very distracting manner. She was doing this on purpose, of course, to get Steven to look at her recently waxed legs. Steven continued to ignore her. “And what about all the messages I left you,” he asked me. “You just thought it was better to ignore those?” “I get a ton of messages from guys I don’t know,” I explained. This was excruciating. “They all say they’re related to me and that I owe them money for something. I stopped listening to Nikki’s—I mean, my messages a long time ago. ” “Great,” Steven said. He turned away, running a hand through his hair…the exact same color and texture hair, I realized, that sprouted from my own head. Only his hadn’t been treated to some golden honey highlights. “That’s just fantastic. Do you still have them? Those messages. Maybe Mom tried to reach you, left you a message or something, telling you where she’s gone. ” “Are you, like, an officer?” Lulu asked Steven, her foot still bobbing like mad. I noticed she’d had a pedicure—Ballet Slipper Pink. Don’t ask me how I know these things when, three months ago, I wouldn’t have been able to tell the different nail polish colors apart if you’d held a gun to my head. “Do you give people orders all day? I love taking orders from a man. It’s so sexy. ” “Sorry,” I said, apologizing both for my roommate and for what I was about to tell him. Because I really was sorry. For both. “I deleted all Nikki’s—I mean, my messages. But”—I slipped a tiny espresso cup under the appropriate spout and pressed the button with a small cup on it—“I’m sure she’ll call back. Right?” Steven shook his head, looking more exhausted than ever, and slid onto one of the kitchen counter stools like he couldn’t support his own weight anymore. Lulu looked delighted, because the seat he’d chosen was only two stools down from hers. Apparently, she didn’t get the subtle message that he’d chosen the stool farthest away from her. She immediately straightened up to show her chest area to better advantage and gave him a dazzling smile, which he ignored. “You really do have amnesia,” he said to me. His face was a mask of misery. I felt so sorry for him, my heart twisted. “Mom never calls back. She’s always been one and done. Why do you think I’m here checking to see if she’s been in touch with you instead of waiting to hear from her back in Gasper?” Lulu completely forgot about making Steven fall in love with her and choked on some of her own saliva. “Did you say G-Gasper?” she gasped between coughs. Steven actually looked at her for a second, then back at me. “You never told her?” he said. It was more of a statement than a question, and it caused me to pause as I slid the espresso, complete with a foamy crème cap on top, in front of him. “Um…apparently not,” I said. I had no idea what he was talking about, either, of course, since I wasn’t actually his sister. His sister was dead. Or at least, her brain was sitting in formaldehyde in a jar somewhere in the bowels of the Stark Institute for Neurology and Neurosurgery, even if the rest of her might have been walking around with my brain inside it, using her credit cards and making her brother espressos. Which made her dead enough. I just couldn’t tell her brother that. Steven was looking at me over his steaming espresso like he couldn’t quite believe what he’d heard. “Wait,” he said, his blue-eyed gaze incredulous. “You don’t remember home, either?” Hesitantly, I shook my head. I didn’t want to hurt him. The truth was, he looked like he’d been hurt enough. But I couldn’t outright lie to him, either, no matter how much Stark Enterprises might expect me to. And now I knew where I’d seen those eyes before: In the mirror, every time I glanced at my new reflection. They were Nikki’s eyes. Only without Chanel Inimitable Multi-Dimensional Mascara in noir/black on the lashes. Steven folded his arms, leaned against the back of his stool, and stared at the ceiling. For a second, I wondered if he was noticing the same thing I’d come home and noticed the other day…the two round holes, no bigger than pennies, on either side of the sunken halogen lamps, that hadn’t been there before and had obviously been filled in, but rapidly and badly, as if someone had been placing something in there and gotten the news that one of the loft’s occupants was coming home early. What were those holes for? They were too high up for me to ever climb up there and check myself—the cei  
lings were twenty feet high, at least. But they couldn’t possibly serve any purpose—other than a nefarious, Stark-related one. Maybe I was just being paranoid. When I asked Karl about the holes, he consulted a maintenance schedule, and told me it looked like a routine wiring check. Wiring, my butt. Maybe “routine wiring” was the reason the RF transmitter—or bug detector, I bought at one of the surveillance gear stores in Midtown shortly after I noticed the holes in the ceiling and my paranoia got the better of me—went crazy every time I turned it on inside the loft. The place was either loaded with listening devices or the detector itself was a total scam (but for the money I paid, it ought to have been genuine). Besides, it didn’t go off anywhere else—school, for instance. But Steven, it appeared, hadn’t noticed the holes. Instead, it looked as if he was staring at the ceiling because he might be trying to hold back tears. Tears over his missing mom, and the fact that I didn’t even remember the hometown we shared in common. I threw a panicky glance at Lulu, who dropped her vamp act for a millisecond and looked just as alarmed as I was. What do we do? our gazes seemed to ask as we stared at each other. We had a big strong military man in our girly loft…and he was crying! Over his lost mother! Oh, this was awful. How could Stark Enterprises have put me in a position like this? It was one thing when I just had to fool makeup artists and Nikki’s mostly heinous ex-boyfriends that I was her and not me. But this was different! Poor guy. I was such a loser. I mean, here I was in all these AP classes at one of the best high schools in Manhattan—I was more capable of using a bug detector, diagramming a complex sentence, using Manolo tips (which, it turned out, meant standing on tiptoe in the water during a beach shoot, to make your legs look longer), and writing a simple string processor than anyone at Tribeca Alternative. But help Nikki Howard’s brother find his mom? My hands were tied, thanks to the confidentiality clause Stark had my parents sign. I couldn’t say a word—especially not here, in the loft. Then I heard a sound come from Nikki’s brother. For one breathless moment, I thought it must have been a sob. A single glance at Lulu revealed she felt the same way I did—like crying, too. It really was just the sweetest thing, this big strong guy, crying over his mom. It took us a second or two to realize Steven wasn’t crying at all. He was laughing. And not like someone who found something genuinely funny, though. “You are a piece of work, Nik,” he finally said, when he looked away from the ceiling. There were tears in his eyes, all right. But they were tears of amusement. “You’re so ashamed of where you come from, you never even told anyone the name of the town you were born in? Not even your best friend?” I blinked at him in confusion. Wait. He was laughing? “Wait. ” Lulu leaned forward on her stool. “You’re laughing?” “Hell, yeah,” Steven said. “How can you not? Did you know this girl used to tell people she was from New York, New York, when we were growing up? That’s how ashamed she was to say she was from Gasper. I’m not surprised she never told you. ” Lulu looked over at me. “Really, Nikki?” she asked. “You used to tell people you were from here?” “How would I know?” I asked. I couldn’t believe I’d thought Nikki’s brother was crying, when he’d been laughing—at me—the whole time. “I have amnesia, remember?” “Yes, she did,” Steven said, in reply to Lulu’s question. Now, instead of ignoring Lulu, he was ignoring me. “Are you saying she never even told you she had a brother?” Lulu shook her head, delighted he was paying attention to her. Her brown eyes were enormous, thanks to last night’s makeup being sexily smudged around her lashes. She looked, as always, adorable, like a doll. “Noooo,” she said. She leaned an elbow on the counter and cupped her pointed chin in her hand so she could peer up at him. “I’d have remembered if she’d mentioned having someone like you around while she was growing up. ” Steven snorted and threw a disgusted look at me. Typical, the look seemed to say. Great. Now my roommate and brother were ganging up on me. Which was so unfair. I was getting blamed for something I didn’t even do. Nikki did it! Or had she? “Look, I don’t mean to be rude or anything…,” I said. Which I knew was a horrible way to start a sentence, because of course whenever you say I don’t mean to be rude, whatever you’re about to say is going to be rude. That was something the Walking Dead, and especially Whitney Robertson, had taught me, since she used to preface all her most tactless barbs with I don’t mean to be rude, but. “I don’t mean to be rude, Em, but have you ever thought about going on a diet? Your butt is so big, it’s almost impossible to pass you in the hallway. Maybe you need to put a sign on your ass that says Wide Load. ” “I don’t mean to be rude, Em, but have you ever considered wearing a bra during PE? Those things are flopping around so much, you’re going to put someone’s eye out. ” “I don’t mean to be rude, Em, but has it ever occurred to you that your harping on how not enough women are entering the sciences might be one of the reasons none of them wants to? Maybe they don’t want to hang around with girls like you. ” Still, even though Whitney’s I don’t mean to be rudes had stung me so many times, I found myself saying the exact same words—and to my own brother, of all people. Well, Nikki’s brother. “…but how do I even know for sure you’re who you say you are?” I asked. The difference between me and Whitney, though, was that I felt awful for my I don’t mean to be rude. I really did. At the same time, how did I know Steven really was Nikki’s brother? I mean, he seemed sincere, and yeah, he looked a lot like the reflection I saw every day in the mirror (and in magazines, and on billboards, and on the sides of buses, and okay, just about everywhere). But there’d been guys (and even some women) showing up in our lobby for weeks now with stories saying they were related to me. How did I know this one was legit? And, I mean, I knew from the way everyone (except Brandon) reacted to me that Nikki must have been pretty awful back in the day. But I had a hard time believing she’d cut her own big brother out of her life…not to mention never having said a word about him to her best friend. Who, by the way, was shooting me an astonished look over my I don’t mean to be rude. “Nikki!” Lulu cried. “Of course Steven is who he says he is! How could you even ask such a thing?” “Well,” I said. I felt bad for having to ask. I really did. If Nikki had kept a family photo instead of press clippings of herself anywhere in the loft, I wouldn’t have had to. But none of this was my fault. “I’m sorry. But you have to admit, Lu, there’ve been a lot of guys lately with kind of similar stories, and I’m just trying to…” My voice trailed off. This was because Steven had reached around to his back pocket, pulled out a wallet, opened it, and unveiled a school photo of a smiling young blond girl in pigtails and braces. He held the wallet, photo dangling forward, in front of me. Wait. What was this?

I've been asked a lot to upload some of my models, so I started with this one after optimizing it a bit.

for those not familiar with gumroad just type in $0 and a fake email btw lol

[https://coffeecow.gumroad.com/l/rxucu](https://coffeecow.gumroad.com/l/rxucu)

A few notes:

The .blend file SHOULD have all the textures assigned / in there properly, but i added a separate zip folder containing all the image files just in case because blender can be kind of wonky with it from time to time; so, if one of the materials appears as pink, replace its image texture with one from the zip file.

The material count is pretty high (4) , and there's definitely room for baking or reducing it a bit. I made this solely for a quick animation, so i didn't pay any mind to it, but if you're putting it into a game or somewhere that optimization is necessary, you might want to bake or repaint and merge the materials so that it's a bit less. Make sure the outline **doesn't** have it's own image texture. just put a dab of the color you want it to use onto one of the other textures and shrink the uvs onto it. It only has its own material for now so that customization is easier.

I changed the outlining to use an inverse hull, so if it doesn't appear make sure you have backface culling enabled in blender (it should already be enabled in the .blend though). You can customize the outline settings in the modifier tab, and change its color in the material tab.

For those who'd like the old outlining that appears in my previous posts, remove the solidifer modifier from the object and then add a scene line art grease pencil; you then need to position the camera (camera object, not your screen) for the outlining to be applied appropriately. P.S, this method is only viable for stuff like animations--if you plan on importing the asset to a game or something, don't do this and just keep the solidifier modifier.

I also scaled down the texture sizes to 1024 for optimization--my texture scaling and uvs aren't great, since I made the model in a rush for last weeks reddit recap, but it shouldn't look bad.

When importing the model to another software, it might lose its glowy / bright effect because it doesn't use blenders shaders or whatever--so you may have to play around with it to keep the effects (if this happens maybe try messing around with emissive maps? not sure. also sort of depends where you're trying to import it.)

lastly, the tri count is about 6000--but the outlines double it, so if you want a lot less then feel free to just remove the outline effects.",1,1749378584.0,u_Latter_Bluejay_1794,0,1.0,False

1l68yo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClosetConfidants/comments/1l68yo2/secondhand_shopping_vs_thrift_store_hunting_pros/,Secondhand Shopping vs. Thrift Store Hunting: Pros and Cons Compared,"Alright, let's talk secondhand! I've been thinking a lot lately about the difference between dedicated secondhand shops (think consignment stores, vintage boutiques) and the more traditional thrift store experience. Both have their appeal, but I think understanding the pros and cons of each can really help you score some amazing finds.

Secondhand stores frequently enough have curated collections – someone has already done the work of weeding out the less desirable items. This is great if you're short on time or have a specific style in mind, but it also means you're likely paying a premium. You might find a nearly new designer handbag for substantially less than retail, but it'll still cost more than something comparable at a thrift store. The return policies tend to be better at secondhand shops, too.

Thrift stores, on the other hand, are the wild west of shopping. You're sifting through everything, from barely worn clothes to items that have clearly seen better days. But that's also where the thrill lies! You can find incredibly cheap clothing, furniture, and unique collectibles. the downside is the time commitment, the potential for damage or stains, and the less forgiving (or non-existent) return policies. Think digging through piles to find a vintage vinyl record for a dollar, or a perfectly good coffee table for ten.

Ultimately, the ""better"" option depends on what you're looking for. Are you hunting for a specific piece and willing to pay a bit more for convenience? Secondhand it is indeed. Are you happy to spend an afternoon rummaging for a bargain and some unexpected treasures? thrift store all the way. What are your experiences?

My head is already full of stress, I would like to find a way to take care of this one.

So - I'm a 24F and I moved to a foreign country  to do a really prestigeous internship in October 2024. I had to leave all my friends, family and boyfriend (which sucks so much, LDR is so hard man) for this job and in the 8 months I was working here I only made 2 friends, and both are leaving in August. I tried getting to know my other coworkers, but it always went like this: I invite them out or ask questions, they reply and never ask questions back. They also never, EVER invite me out with them. Not even for coffees. It sucks when someone so obviously doesn't want to get to know you.

Let's say, I have been battling with pretty bad loneliness for the past 2 months - crying almost every night, feeling scared and drained etc. It's getting to a point where it's really hard to find joy in anything. Except my work/job or when I call my boyfriend/friends. It also sucks that I have to do my thesis whenever I'm not at work, and I live in a crappy appartment, so that adds an extra layer of stress I don't really need.

Now I got offered a full-time position and I took it. This job is a really, really good job, amazing for my CV. Hard to get it anywhere in Europe. The difference between an internship and a full-time job is huge. I'm telling myself I should just hold on for another year to get more experience, then hand in my resignation letter and return home, to my boyfriend and everyone I love.

I think I'm just overwhelmed by everything. At home I have a lot of good friends, my loving boyfriend, my loving family... here I am away from all of it and I guess it's a shock. But the job offers in my home country are none-existant in my field. 

Anyway, how do I cope? How do I stop feeling so lonely?

I plan to move to a different, better place, get a car etc. Bu these ideas don't help at all with my feelings of loneliness.

It’s nothing special, everyday terrible things happen to innocent people, this knowledge is inescapable now in our age of information. You gasp at the headlines, hurt for strangers, donate to the GoFundMe, and maybe even find yourself worrying that you’ll be the next person whose name will feature in an in memoriam or trending hashtag.

you might have, but I didn’t. 

Never in a million years did I think what would happen to my family, and me afterwards, was a possibility in life. I suppose that’s what made me the perfect victim of life’s casual dealings of cruelty, my ignorance to it. An open handed slap in the face that the universe saved especially for me. 

That is what it feels like to be struck by tragedy, like it was always waiting for you, reserved by something more powerful. 

As if it were some cosmic puppeteer that arranged for the murder of my wife and children while they slept in their beds.

Maybe it was.

After what I saw with the tree that grew in my backyard afterwards, I’ll believe in anything.

If you’ve heard of a little town called Archmouth, I’m sure you also know about what happened there two years ago. Or rather, who happened. 

The Rock-a-Bye Man. 

That name still feels insulting. Such a gross effort to mythologize a very sick individual, who if you somehow don’t know already, took the lives of four families in the comforts of their own homes.

He’d break in the dead of night with a screwdriver and hammer, sneak into each room where someone slept, and use those same tools on them. Bluntly. A month-long killing spree.

What people should understand is that Archmouth is just a quaint little slice of classic Americana, nestled in the wooded hills of Central Pennsylvania, it borders right on that edge of complete country solitude. The kind of place where the sweet old people you meet live in the same house they grew up in and everyone shows up for the Friday night high school football games. Frozen in time. A place that only really existed for the people who lived there. I loved it.

I was one of the rare “outsiders” as the locals teasingly called me, having moved there to marry my wife, Elle, who I had met while attending medical school in Philly. She was a friend of a friend, a chance meeting at a party with a girl way out of my league. Her pale, sweet face was complemented by intense sapphire eyes and long black hair. 

She was as beautiful as the moon. 

The most kind, intelligent, and playful person I’ve ever met, and after mustering up the courage to ask for a first date, I knew I was utterly captured by her. To my surprise, we clicked together like a puzzle piece, and after three years of being together I knew that what I had wanted from the start was true, she was the one. I took a crazy gamble and got down on one knee. I thought I was dreaming when she said yes, and right after I graduated, we got married.

Elle was born and raised in Archmouth, and having been lucky enough to love her, I wanted to trace it all back to the source, as if the secret to her loveliness was where she was born and would in turn be passed down to the twin babies in her belly. Cody and Jay, who were fortunately every bit their mother, only inheriting my brown eyes and fear of the dark. 

It was Elle who reassured them there were no monsters under the bed, but me? I could never be so sure.

The home we lived in wasn’t anything special by Armouth standard. One of the many old farmhouses that were revived into homes. We were mostly hidden away in the woods. Modest in all accounts except our backyard, which was pretty huge. Elle and I figured it would be the perfect place for the boys to live in. We were right.

Our six years together made everything else before that seem meaningless. I didn’t come from a happy home and haven’t spoken to my parents in eight years, but that’s a whole different story. I thought love like this only existed in the movies. It was like I found more of my heart with them day by day in all the little responsibilities of being a husband and father. My work as a physician was fine, but it was the time I spent with them that I really felt I nurtured something to health.

Archmouth was blissfully disengaged with the rest of the world until the murders brought their attention. Naturally, nobody had a goddamned clue what to do, the worst thing the Archmouth Police Station had to investigate up to this point was a 17 year old who kept stealing vending machines, so neighboring towns and counties stepped in to help, along with national media coverage that gave the monster his name. 

The atmosphere was of course filled with fear, and overnight the warm little town that I had fallen in love with, my home, became a landmark of human wickedness. I was scared the same as everybody else, but when I took Elle to the firing range to learn how to handle the revolver we then kept under our pillow, or when I taught the boys how to hop on and tackle a man down to the ground and keep him there, in the back of my mind I never thought they’d need to use it. I couldn’t believe that such viciousness would be allowed to reach my beautiful family. 

Then one night, after an extended shift at the hospital, I would come home to see what had been done. An image that will never leave me, but I still today can’t describe without sobbing. 

How foolish I was to still let the boys build their pillow forts in the living room during all this.

It wasn’t any of the police’s efforts that found him, the morning after he destroyed my life, he turned himself in. Elle had got one good shot at the bastard, and he had to crawl out of his hole in the woods to get help or die. I remember feeling nothing when I heard the court declare the young man was insane and needed to be hospitalized in a psychiatric care. 

That angered a lot of people that wanted him to be “served justice” like a proper criminal, but all that mattered to me was that he couldn’t hurt anybody else. 

That man’s real name, which is rarely ever said, was Judah Dismas. Just a mute, anti-social orphan who had gone missing three years earlier from his residential psychiatric youth center, which was states away. He was only 15. Whatever happened to him at that time made him into a monster by 18.

But I’m not interested in who he was or what made him that way. To me he was not some boogeyman to psychoanalyze and listen to true crime podcasts about, he was the man who killed my family.

We were his fourth and final victims, sixteen in total. 

Morgan Hill, Georgina Hill, Aubrie Hill, Josh Patel, Daisy Patel, Riley Patel, Jamie Patel, Lewis Fisher, Sophia Fisher, Liam Fisher, Elliot Fisher, Haley Fisher  Elle Moss, Cody Moss, Jay Moss, and me, Toby Moss. 

Remember those names instead.

About three months after The Rock-a-Bye reign of terror ended, I had my first attempt at an honest conversation about all that’s happened with my best buddy Ben during a smoke break, him being another physician at where I worked. I remember he asked me if I would move out of town like the many others who did in the time after the killings, which shrunk our population down from about 3,105 to 2,766. 

I said no. 

I thought about it at first, as I really wasn’t living in my house at that point. I just couldn’t stand being inside there. Even with the new carpets, I could still see the bloodstains. I couldn’t even look at my bed or the living room couch, so for an entire year I slept in my car. And of course, I didn’t want to leave where my family was buried, almost as if they would think I was abandoning them to rot in the ground while I dusted myself off to start somewhere new.

Despite being a baptized Christian, I’m not very spiritual or religious, but I did think of them as “watching over me” as so many of the kind old grandmas who offered their condolences told me. 

I know they meant well, but I think all it did was make me feel worse. Haunted.

What were they thinking? Did they resent me for not being there? To neither protect or die alongside them? And if there is another side, would they let me hold them when we meet again? 

Guilt is an unreasonable beast.

Ben and I also felt the need to talk about what happened to our Mayor Kayla Meadows, how could you not? It almost felt mandatory to talk about what happened to her at least one time with each person in Archmouth. 

Meadows before the killings was a humble and traditional older woman who just felt like one of the locals at heart, but she was constantly working behind the scenes to bring the community themed celebrations and fundraising initiatives. She always had a sweet new story from her childhood to tell us during her speeches that always circled back to the importance of keeping a strong community in Archmouth.

The biggest town event was Archmouth’s Harvest Festival, which was always held the day before Halloween at our town park, Cardinal’s Nest, named after all the red cardinal birds that lived in the tall trees. The harvest was what people loved the most, with hayrides through the woods, pumpkin pie-eating contests, an evening bonfire with a folk band, and completed with a shit ton of beer. It was fun.

I remember Cody and Jay would practically hyperventilate with excitement for the “Little Scarecrow Parade”, where all the kids would dress up in rags stuffed with straw and march through the park. 

Elle even had her own crafts booth where she would sell her pottery, mostly mugs. 

She was quite popular because of that. 

Some people even left them at her grave with flowers planted inside.

Now all I can think about is how Cardinal Nest’s was also where Judah Dismas’ hideout was, where he lived deep in the woods and somehow survived for an entire year before crawling out in the dark to do what he did. 

The festival would often extend to the late hours of the night, and sometimes I wonder if he heard all the loud laughter and drunken square dancing while he ate at deer carcasses and slept under a fallen tree.

Maybe that fueled something.

Meadows was rarely ever seen when Judah Dismas was killing people, only peeking her head out to give statements to the media that those in charge “are doing everything they can”.

That was it.

It felt like we had been abandoned by our leader. She even refused a statement when Judah was put away. Complete silence. 

Except for the day of my family’s funeral, which fell on the day of the Harvest Festival. 

The whole community had shown up at St. Elizabeth’s Church, the same place I had married Elle and would put her to rest with our children. To this day, I have nothing but love for the people of Archmouth, the warmth and support they showed me during this time was enough to move mountains, and I’m eternally grateful, even if I didn’t exactly show it at the time.

But to the surprise and disdain of just about everyone, Mayor Meadows walked in the first Archmouth gathering that wanted nothing to do with her.

I was in a haze during all this. I just wanted to be alone. So when Meadows suddenly asked if she could say a few words at the podium beside those three closed casket coffins, all I could do was nod.

From the echoes of my memory, Meadows went up there and said this: “My friends, let me first start by saying I’m sorry. I hope you know I love you all very dearly, and that my silence during these…” I remember she danced around the words, “...tragedies…is inexcusable, even if it was because I was stricken with such overwhelming fear. I have never in my 68 years gone through such a nightmare. Again…I am sorry.” She was silent for a few moments, just looking down at her hands, then a cough from somebody in the pews snapped her attention back at us. 

“I remember when I was a little girl, my Grandpa Alfie would take me down to Cardinal’s Nest every Friday after school. We’d walk down past the dirt road behind this very church down to where the trees grow thick and tall, and with us we’d bring one jar of honey.” She chuckled, I think. “My grandpa would get all mad at me when I would sneakily scoop a finger inside the jar, because we weren’t there to have a picnic. No. We were making an offering.”

She imitated the stern wag of a finger and seemingly her grandfather’s voice. “This land remembers. It takes count of every single one of us, and when it comes time, those born here will return to its soil.” Meadows then started to imitate someone digging with a shovel, still with that voice. “It’s our job to keep it happy, to show our gratitude for letting us live on its beautiful surface.”

She did that maybe-a-laugh thing again as she broke character, shaking her head. “At first I thought it was silly watching my grandpa bury an entirely good jar of honey, but over the years I think I started to understand. Here in Archmouth, belief in anything is powerful…and it’s our love and trust for one another that this land allowed us…it approved of it.” She spoke the next words through gritted teeth. “And that man was an outsider…a cancer out to destroy and unleash torment on the loved…nothing more.” She placed her hand on Elle’s coffin, still for a moment. “Our roots will remain strong forever.”

After that, Meadows started to weep, and as if pulled by an invisible string, she left the church.

A week later she was found floating down Cardinal Nest’s creek. A suicide. 

Her son took over as mayor soon after. 

They don’t do the Harvest Festival anymore.

Ben and I agreed she was a woman with her own troubles, and left it at that.

It was when Ben started to ask about me that I felt myself shrink a little. I didn’t like to talk about myself after what had happened, and hearing Ben's thinly veiled layer of concern in his voice, I already knew why he felt the need to ask. He first told me that I have every right to still be grieving, but was concerned with my behavior around the hospital, specifically about how I would insist on working longer hours and would even sometimes sleep there. And then there was just my general behavior, the way I laughed too loudly at simple jokes, made strangely casual self-deprecating comments, and to put it so blatantly, “was acting like a guy who didn’t get the worse of it”. 

I remember I ended the topic with a simple “I’m fine, trust me”, that kind of nonreassuring tone that says: I’m not giving you anything, so let’s both drop it. I insisted we talked about football instead, which we did. That’s how I presented myself for a while. I was acting like what happened to me was just a bad deal of cards, which I’m sure made a lot of folks, including Ben, very uncomfortable. 

To cry about it would feel like I was defeated. I still couldn’t tell you what I was trying to prove.

I also couldn’t have told you about what was growing in my backyard. I simply didn’t know how. 

I still don’t really know how.

But maybe it’s at least worth a try.

There’s something wrong with Archmouth. Something incomprehensible. Something alive. And it tried to come for me.

It was the day after the funeral, Halloween, when I first noticed it. Something was sprouting out of the ground in the center of my backyard. I had thought it was a weed at first, but when I got a closer look I realized it couldn’t have been. No, it was a small dark branch poking out through the earth with a little red leaf on top. I ran my finger along it, feeling its thorns and wondering what the hell it was. I tugged at it without making it so much as budge, it was firmly in place. 

I kept yanking at it for a minute before giving up. Whatever. 

Who am I to argue with Mother Nature?  I don’t know jack shit about plants anyway, maybe this was normal. 

It took me a second to realize I had cut my finger on one of the thorns. 

Later I was at the town library, where I was spending most of my free time. The owners were sweet people and seemed to be happy that I found some comfort there, where I was reading stories about happier people. 

Anywhere except my house felt better. 

However, something about that nearly black twig in my backyard kept me thinking about it, and out of curiosity, I tried to look up some more information on the computer. I couldn’t find a single thing. You know when you can just feel it in your gut that something strange is going on? Like there really is a sixth sense for the unnatural?

It’s almost funny, because I remember feeling that way right then and there from just a few simple google searches. 

When I drove home I noticed there wasn’t a trick-or-treater in sight despite how late in the evening it was. I guessed the kids had enough of the scariness for one year. I was relieved, because that meant I could comfortably camp out in my car without worrying about anyone disturbing me. 

So I did what I was usually doing at this point: I pulled up in my parking lot, climbed into the backseats, and closed my eyes. Waiting for tomorrow. 

I know. I should’ve been seeing a therapist who could help me find the strength to walk back into my own home for something else besides a shower, change of clothes, and food, which in itself was its own struggle. “Eventually”, I kept telling myself. But I knew there was no chance I could comfortably rest in that house again.

The next morning, when I was walking in my kitchen with my head to the floor, fixing myself a bowl of cheerios, something caught my eye through the back window. That little branch had another red leaf, and not only that, it had already grown about a solid inch.

The next year of my life was a dull blur, most days being a rough repeat of wake up, go to work, drive home, sleep in the car. But now every once in a while I would look in my backyard to see that this branch was growing…and growing…and growing…and before I knew it I was staring at a small tree, about six feet tall with thorny black wood and red leaves, its skinny branches stretching up as if reaching for the sun. 

Enough time had passed for that sense of unease to fade, in fact, I thought it was kind of pretty now. Besides, it was just a tree. Maybe it was the meds that lowered my suspicions.

I had started some medication that Ben had convinced me to try, just some anti-anxiety that kept certain suffocating feelings at bay. The meds helped me think clearly about what needed to be done. What I needed to do to stop myself from floating in a cloud of misery and try to heal. It was Ben who also convinced me to finally move, that Elle and the boys would understand why I had to leave the home we built together, and that it was time to “get out of the damn car, Toby”

I agreed. 

After finally accepting paid leave from work, it was time to make a change. I found an apartment up for lease on the opposite side of town and was moving in just a few days later. Nothing special, just a single bedroom.

I didn’t take anything with me. Not even the small things. Not Elle’s favorite mug. Or Cody’s nightlight. Or Jay’s shoes, still lined up by the door. Some things felt they should stay.

I know I could’ve moved farther, but like I said before, I wasn’t going to leave my family completely. They were still here in Archmouth, one way or another. And I wasn’t ready to say goodbye to this community after all we’ve been through together.

I should’ve left then, because it wasn’t long before the nightmares began.

I couldn’t quite remember them at first, some nights I would wake up with a gasp, like the air was knocked out of me. I couldn’t fall back asleep either. I had this awful feeling in my chest, like something was sitting on me. At first I thought I was developing sleep apnea. I had developed a smoking habit after all, but after getting a check up I was told there were no signs. 

Weird. 

Then Judah Dismas died, and it got worse.

There was nothing dramatic about how I found out. It was about seven in the morning at Frankie’s, my favorite spot for breakfast, where I was sipping my coffee and munching on a BLT, then I saw the headline on my phone. 

“The Rock-a-Bye Man, Pennsylvania’s most notorious serial killer, found killed in psychiatric care.” 

I remember how tightly I gripped my mug as I silently read what had happened, apparently Judah had been acting out at the psychiatric hospital. He was attacking other patients, some nurses too, even bit someone’s lower lip clean off. Judah being thrown in a holding cell for the night wasn’t an uncommon occurrence, but one day when a nurse was delivering his food, they found him lying flat on his stomach with a single stab to the neck from a scalpel. 

The hospital tried to keep this incident under wraps for a few days, not wanting the attention of a murder during their care, but a whistleblower leaked the details before they could properly dispose of the body.

I didn’t know how to feel, I certainly wasn’t sad for Judah, but happy? No, not that either. Judah was only eighteen when it was determined the rest of his life would be surrounded in padded rooms and in straight jackets. Everyone knew there was no chance of reformation. There is no getting better for some people. 

Maybe whoever did it was doing him a service.

That night was when I was starting to remember my dreams. 

I dreamt that I was at home. 

Our home. 

It was Sunday morning and Elle and I were in the kitchen, doing our parts in making breakfast. Sunday was always when we would go all in on the most important meal of the day, with pancakes, muffins, waffles, bacon and eggs, the whole works. We were speaking to one another as we swapped places between the stove and toaster, but none of the words were coming out right, a natural conversation was playing out through muffled noises. I murmured something smug and she laughed, the only clear sound that came out. 

As I was starting to set the table, I looked out the back window to search for the boys, who always played before it was time to stuff their faces. 

They were out there. 

And so was the tree. 

It stood there fully grown, its red leaves swaying in slow dance. Cody and Jay were chasing each other under its shadow, a game of tag between two people. 

Dream-me felt warm inside. 

The tree felt like it belonged there. 

Then behind me I heard the ring of the doorbell. I turned back just in time to see the front door open by itself. Mayor Meadows stood there, dripping wet in the same nightgown they found her in, her skin sagged like it was stapled to skinny bones, a pair of dead fish eyes stared directly into mine. 

I woke up with a scream.

The dreams that followed had that similar pattern. It would always be at home with me and my family doing one of our little traditions, our Friday pizza and movie nights, sledding when it first snowed every year, pumpkin carving in the fall, sweet things like that. 

Then there she would be. 

Either peering through a window, in the middle of the hallway, or outside standing next to the tree, Mayor Meadows would always make her appearance, always looking a bit more dead. 

The worst one had to be while I was having dinner with my dream family. Cody had dropped his fork, and when I leaned down to grab it for him, I was treated to the sight of Meadows crouched under the dining table. 

It started to feel like an accident when I saw her, like she was trying to hide. 

After the first few nights, I was getting less scared and more annoyed. It felt like I had been doing so well. Why was my brain finding a new way to torture me? No amount of stress exercises or sleep aid playlists were keeping the dreams at bay, so one night, I decided I simply wasn’t going to sleep. 

I was tired of it. 

I thought maybe all I needed was a good time with some friends to calm down whatever was happening in my subconscious, so I called up Ben and some other people from the hospital and we made a night of it. It was about 3AM when I drunkenly stumbled back into my apartment. Despite my efforts to convince them to come over, they refused. After all, most of them still had families. 

Soon I was sitting on the couch with a bowl of popcorn watching Napoleon Dynamite. The perfect movie to watch under some kind of substance. It was right around that scene where Uncle Rico hurls a steak at Napoleon where I started to feel my eyelids get heavy. 

Sleep took me forcefully, but not for too long, because the sound of twigs soon woke me up. 

I had never experienced sleep paralysis before, but as I stared up at the ceiling unable to move my head or the rest of my body, I had quickly realized what was happening. The only thing I could hear was the crunching of wood. 

It sounded like it was below me. 

It was getting louder. 

Approaching. 

I knew that if I started freaking out it would only make things worse, so I closed my eyes and started to count down from 30. I did that until the noises stopped. I thought it was safe enough to open my eyes again. I was wrong. 

What I saw above me was black roots stretched across the ceiling, red leaves scattered across each one. They were moving together like an entanglement of limbs, slowly taking shape into something. 

All I could do was stare when they finally formed into a rough imitation of Meadows, her wooden body glued to the ceiling above me. 

Nothing in those hollow sockets.

Her mouth of black tree bark split open into a gaping maw. I tried to scream when a thick black ooze came pouring out from her. It casted across my face like a mask, blinding me in pitch black. 

I felt like I couldn’t breathe. 

Then with what almost sounded like the snap of a finger, I was somewhere else. I stood in the middle of St. Elizabeth’s Church, where in front of me three coffins were laid. Their caskets open. 

Elle and the boys didn’t look dead the way I had found them, they didn’t have their heads bludgeoned in by the back of a hammer and their bodies weren’t defiled by the sharp edge of a screwdriver. 

They looked peaceful. 

Like they had gone to sleep. 

Then I realized their lips were moving. 

All three of them whispered, “Grow with us. Grow with us. Grow with us.” as thorny veins crept up their necks.

I don’t remember waking up, but when I came to, I was slamming my head against the floor. 

I didn’t sleep again after that. 

How easy it was for the already fragile pillars of my mind to come crumbling down.

The longest the human body can go without sleep is typically about three to four days, I had gone for eight.

That week was spent huddled in my apartment. No eating, no showering, no shaving. I ignored every call, every knock. I was a thunderstorm of bad feelings. My thoughts were being tossed between sadness, numbness, fear, and a rage so intense it made me want to take it out on the next person I saw. 

Maybe I could kill two birds with one stone by suicide-through-cop. 

But on the eighth day, all came to reason. I finally “understood” what was happening. 

Something else was at play here.

I was staring at my reflection in the bathroom, trying to recognize myself through bloodshot eyes and a wiry beard, when I heard a rattling sound coming from the kitchen. I had been hearing things already, a knocking, someone whispering, and the only way to make those noises stop was to go check where they were coming from, where I would always find nothing. 

That’s what I figured the rattling was, another trick my rotting psyche was playing on me, but when I walked into the kitchen I saw something waiting for me. 

Growing out from the kitchen sink drain was a thick root. 

That same black wood and red leaves sprouting from it, except this time I knew I wasn’t dreaming. It was reaching out to me like it knew exactly which corner I would turn from. It looked like a gnarled hand, with its long wooden fingers curled up, holding something. 

I felt lightheaded when I saw that it was Elle’s favorite mug. The one I had left behind.

I couldn’t lie to myself anymore. I had been telling myself that the tree was just a symbol of my misery, only being present in my dreams because it was the first new thing that came into my life after it had been destroyed. Now I could only wish for it to be that simple. 

It was here. 

It had found me. 

It wanted me to come home. 

When I took a step closer, the thorny hand let go of the mug, letting it smash to the ground, then it just as quickly slithered down the drain.

I bought myself an axe.

While I was driving back home that night, I still wasn’t sure what to think. Hell, what was I even expecting? A fight with a monster? The tree, whether an imitation or not, was only wood just the same. But now I knew that whatever pulled the strings was alive, and existed beyond my backyard. 

The way it used Elle’s mug to beckon me back home would have only been done by something conscious.

It knew my pain and was actively using it against me.

If whatever it was really is alive, and if it really knew how to manipulate my emotions, maybe I could show that I wasn’t going to stand for it any longer. 

I was going to cut down what I knew was real. 

I was done being a victim.

The house was still as vacant as the day I left it. I’d hauled most of it to the dump. Everything in my apartment had been new and untouched by memory. I remember even telling the real estate agent the property might as well be destroyed. Who would want to live here, knowing what happened? They got back to me weeks later and told me (a little too excitedly) that they had a promising visitor, who turned out to be a YouTuber making a documentary on the oh so infamous Archmouth. Of course they were.

I was clutching my axe like a piece of wood floating at sea when I stepped through the front door. I didn’t think it at the time, but I wonder how close I resembled Judah when he breached my home. I wonder if he felt my sense of dread. That instinct in our minds that tells us that we don’t belong there.

As I slowly stepped into the kitchen, I was hit by red. From outside the back window, a glowing, nearly blinding red light was pouring inside. I rubbed my eyes as I stepped closer to the window, squinting to get a better look. 

It was the tree, except now it was taller. Much taller. 

The last time I had seen it in person it was eye-level, but now it was the size of the house. It was still so very skinny, like a good push would be enough to knock it all down. Its leaves were the source of this red light, each one glowing like a neon bulb swaying gently in the night breeze. 

It was beautiful. It was terrible. I stole my breath and stepped outside.

I approached it slowly like a tamer in a lion’s cage. There was no turning back now. I knew what had to be done. When I stood under its red glow, I could hear the sound of buzzing coming from inside its trunk. Like it was filled with bees.

My skin crawled.

No more time to waste.

I pulled my axe back and swung the hardest I ever had in my life.

The moment the blade hit the bark, everything went black.

Darkness.

For a moment, I thought I was dead, but then I heard the sound of my own heart beating out of my chest. I reached out before I could think, my hands clumsily searching the dark to feel around for anything. Then my hand brushed against a thorn, then some wood, and then something sticky. I was boxed in at all sides. I tried to stand up, but wherever I was, I couldn’t fully extend my legs. I was trapped. Bent. Stuck in a crouch. 

Cocooned. 

I started to panic and cried out for help, flailing around like an animal caught in a trap. No use. The wood swallowed my voice entirely. Then I felt the rubber grip of my axe.

Thank fuck.

I instantly lifted it up and started to hack around aimlessly, chipping at the thorny wood bit by bit until a sliver of dull red light started to pour in. Then another. And another. 

I screamed as I swung the axe around until an opening finally gave way, spilling out of a wooden shell face-first into the dust.

When I looked up, I yet again thought I had died.

This was Hell. It had to have been.

An endless forest of dark skeletal trees sprawled around me, their branches like claws as they reached up to a voided sky. Thousands of red leaves glowed on them, fluttering upwards like gravity in reverse. They swayed without wind, creaking as they grinded together in an almost sensual rhythm. They were dancing with one another.

I laid on a single dirt path, the only piece of ground that wasn’t covered in sharp thorns. It stretched outward, winding further into the staggering trees. Something scuttled and ducked through the woods.

I stumbled onto my feet and walked forward. My axe was my lifeline. It was all I could do.

The air was hot. Thick. I could barely breathe the more I ventured into the ceaseless path. It reeked of something rotten, the smell was suffocating me. In my dizziness, I barely noticed when I stepped on a bloodstained pillow.

The remains of a pillow fort rested on a branch above me. Blood dripped down.

I kept walking.

The trees kept offering.

My medical degree. Elle’s wedding dress. A family photo.

When I closed my eyes to power through, I started to hear the whispering. Multiple voices.

“You weren’t there.” “You should have died.” “Daddy? I’m scared.” “Grow with us.”

In the split second I opened my eyes I saw one of the whisperers before it dodged behind a tree.

It looked like a scarecrow.

I heard it before I saw it. Something wet squelched in the distance in a pulsating flow. I was nearing its red glow at the end of the trail where nothing except a wall of thorns remained. A fleshy mass of flesh stuck out, the thorns wrapped around it like barbed wire as it throbbed hideously.

I lifted up my axe, but before I could bring it down, I froze. I watched as it began to take shape.

Just like how it had been with Meadows, the body formed was a poor mimicry of wood. But it was unmistakable.

I recognized those gaunt and tall limbs, now made of rotted wood.

I recognized that gangly black matted hair, now made of thorns.

I recognized that sunken face, now carved. It had stared back at me in court.

The Rock-a-Bye Man.

He lifted his right arm, his wooden hand a morph between fingers and a hammer.

“Outsider”

We lurched forward at the same time. Me screaming. Him dead silent. I brought my axe down over and over in attempts at a desperate strike, but he was too fast. He dodged and moved in jerky, unnatural spasms. He was toying with me, letting me tire myself out before he swung and struck with a screwdriver for a hand, stabbing into my thigh. The wood that pierced into my flesh was freezing cold. I didn’t have the time to cry in pain, he had already brought his hammer hand around to slam across my chest. I fell back onto a bed of thorns, digging through my shirt and into my skin. I stared up at the starless black sky as I listened to the dull footsteps of my fate approach. My axe was trapped beside me, entangled in the veins.

There would be no one to find me.

He hovered over me with that expressionless wooden face that almost rivaled the one of flesh I knew well. Then he brought his hammer down on my ribs. Again and again and again and again.

Is this how they had felt? Was it just as slow and painful? Were they as quiet as I was? I thought it was meant to stop hurting at some point. Did it stop hurting for them? Was it the recoil that knocked the gun out of Elle’s hand? I thought we had worked on that. Did my babies cry out for me when the monster under the bed finally came out? I told them I’d keep them safe forever. Would I have made a difference that night? Could I have stopped him? Would I have died too?

Was I already dead?

I screamed with the last of my breath as I stretched my hand through the thorns to grab my axe, bringing it up in time to block the hammer about to slam into my face, and pushed the monster off with my foot. The blade of the axe dragged across his arm, splintering it, black liquid seeping out.

Something howled in pain. Not him. Something further into the woods. I didn’t care. I kept swinging.

He struggled to keep up, I was charged with an adrenaline that could lift boulders.

I was alive, and he was not.

Finally, I cleanly hacked into his wooden ribs, the tar pouring out. He faltered with the axe blade snug inside his side, but still tried to fight, his arms swinging in motion with the trees around us that writhed wildly. The world was screaming in pain. The whispers came back.

“Let go.” “Come back.” “Lie down.”

But I didn’t.

Eventually enough of its black blood had drained out, and it fell to its knees. I cried as I brought my axe down across its neck while it remained knelt, like a warrior accepting its execution, taking its head clean off.

I kept hacking at the wooden corpse. Weeping. The trees stilled. The leaves dimmed. I collapsed.

I saw something beautiful that I can’t remember, and fell asleep.

I woke up to the sound of Ben crying. He was screaming my name under flashing red and blue lights. The sun was rising, and as the paramedics hoisted me up on a gurney, I realized where I was.

Cardinal’s Nest.

I could only hear the sound of the flowing creek.

There had been a wellness check at my apartment. When they didn’t find me, they were concerned. When they found my car parked outside my old home, they became terrified. A search party soon followed, and they soon found me lying right under the tallest and steepest hill in the park, where if one would fall from they’d be lucky to survive.

That’s where they thought my injuries came from.

And I admit, I also let them think it was a suicide attempt

How could I explain what had happened?

I was placed in psychiatric care, where for the first time in forever, I slept comfortably.

That was five months ago.

Today is June 8th, 2025, it is 6:20 AM, and I am now living far away from Archmouth, Pennsylvania.

It’s been fun settling back into the hustle and bustle of city life. Los Angeles is unlike any other place I’ve been before. Kind of a shithole, sure, but it's got sunshine and a weird sort of character. My place is small, but cozy. In a couple days, I get my California state medical license.

It took a lot to convince my therapists and friends that I was ready to leave. But eventually, they saw it. I was the Toby they remembered.

By the time I moved out, I was already halfway out the door at work. They just didn’t know how to say it. I don’t think they ever would. They were too good.

If anyone from Archmouth is reading this. I love you.

Please leave.

And you, an outsider like me, thank you.

Don’t go to Archmouth.

It is your choice to believe me, but I know what I saw.

There’s evil there as real as the trees and dirt below.

Before I left Archmouth, I did go back to that house. I had to see it for myself that I had cut down the tree. I didn’t. Instead what I saw was a hole surrounded by a patch of dead grass. I peered down into its abyss.

Down the drain it had gone again.

I was scared, not of whatever it was that lurked here, but of what would happen next. What would happen to me? Was it really as simple as to keep going? Was I running or being chased to the next chapter? These were my consuming thoughts. A repetition of anxieties at least once a day. I was having those same feelings while walking away from the house for that final time.

A chorus of singing birds was what stopped me in my tracks.

I looked behind me, and atop the house’s roof, three red cardinals sat perched. Chirping away.

I stood for a minute, taking in nature’s beautiful song, and then watched as they each took flight with a low dive off the house, sweeping back into the air in time with each other in a way only they could communicate, before disappearing into the trees.

I still hurt. But I am alive. That is all that could possibly matter.

I climbed back into my car, started the engine, and started down the road leading to tomorrow.

I laughed between a choked sob.

I love watching movies/TV/YouTube, playing Sims, listening to music, going for drives, hiking, swimming and I’m obsessed with iced coffee!! 

Looking forward to chatting soon,
