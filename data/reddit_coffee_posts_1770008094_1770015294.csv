1qtnyfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qtnyfs/back_to_dating_and_im_done_playing_nice_these_men/,Back to dating and I’m done playing nice — these men get ZERO access now. Any other tactics?,"I’m back on dating apps after a break and I’ve completely changed how I operate. This is no longer romantic, hopeful, or “let’s see where it goes.” It’s tactical and intentional.

I’m not interested in giving access to men who bring nothing but entitlement and excuses.

At this point in my life, **men who are unattractive, sexually unappealing, out of shape, short, balding, sloppy, desperate, cheap, rushed, emotionally needy, unemployed, broke, uneducated, uncultured, living with their parents, addicted, lacking discipline, no car, no home, no real life experience, no travel, no foreign language, no hobbies, no responsibility — do not get access to me. At all.**

Not my time.  
Not my energy.  
Not my emotions.  
Not my body.

I’m done with the pattern where a guy wants closeness immediately with zero effort. No more “coffee dates” that turn into expectations. No bar dates. No car hangouts. No “let’s just vibe” nonsense. No rushing intimacy. No emotional dumping. No pretending we’re in a relationship after 2–3 low-effort meetups.

For me now, **the first 10 dates come with zero emotional intimacy, zero sex, zero personal disclosure**. No private life details, no vulnerability, no access. Car, home, trips, weekends, emotions — all off limits. If that scares him off, good. That’s the point.

I don’t “manage” men anymore.  
I don’t educate them.  
I don’t fix them.  
I don’t motivate them.

If a man is inconsistent, cheap, unclear, evasive, lazy, or tries to guilt me with “you’re cold / distant / guarded” — he’s out immediately. Those lines are just manipulation for faster access.

Also: **no real name, no phone number, no address, no social media early on.** Way too many men get obsessive, stalk, harass, or reappear months later. I don’t owe anyone permanent access just because we matched.

Yes, I know this sounds strict. I don’t care. It works.

And before anyone asks: yes, I’m matching with very attractive, wealthy, well-dressed, confident men right now. All photo-verified. We’ll see who’s real and who isn’t — but at least now I’m filtering from a position of control instead of hope.

So my question to the women here (or anyone dating strategically):

**What other tactics or rules have you used that actually saved you time, energy, and sanity?**  
Any red flags you now eliminate instantly?  
Any boundaries that changed everything for you?

Not looking to be told to “be softer.” I already tried that. It didn’t work.",1,1770015260.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I do remember that feeling inside me, as a 26-year-old male smoker, and I don't care about my family. Now as a 29-year-old I am not a smoker and I hate smoking and thank god I quit smoking. But from my financial perspective, I feel like I haven't changed a lot which I hate this feeling inside me.

I am trying to change, but I feel like it's so hard to overcome the gradual phase, I do remember that fitness coach when I asked him why I am still mediocre, and why I am not changing. And he told me you will gradually overcome any phase that you are facing in any chapter of your life and eventually he is right, the saddest thing is about to change is you need to change your system, your habits, and it is step by step. Otherwise, you will not be changing, and you will be stuck.

To everyone who reads this post, I wish a long happy life for you. And my mom always says there is no long happy life, life will have ups and downs and we have to adapt to it. And we have to overcome our misery and I agree with her.",1,1770015020.0,hawajees,0,1.0,False

1qtnvaz,https://i.redd.it/hmouxdg631hg1.jpeg,My Amateur Collection Review!!,"❄️ WINTERS

Liquid Brun: This is essentially a ""warm hug"" in a bottle.Think creamy vanilla mixed with a bit of spice. It’s sweet but sophisticated, perfect for when the air gets crisp and you’re wearing a coat.

Khamrah Qahwa: If you like the original Khamrah, this is her more mature, caffeinated cousin. It’s got that signature boozy, apple-pie sweetness, but the added coffee note makes it darker and less ""sugar-overload."" It’s cozy, loud, and lasts forever on clothes.

☀️ SUMMER 

Khadlaj Island: This one is pure vacation vibes. It’s light, coconutty, and very easy to wear when the sun is Sunning. It doesn't last too long ...it just makes you smell clean and slightly fruity.

AAM Kaaf: This is a hidden gem for the heat. It’s a beastly performer for a fresh fragrance. It smells like high-quality laundry mixed with a cool sea breeze.

💼 WORK

Armaf Club de Nuit Intense Man: The ""MAN"" scent. While the opening can be a bit sharp (like lemon cleaner for the first 5 minutes), the dry down is legendary. It projects confidence and smells ""expensive"" to everyone else in the workplace.

🎩 SPECIAL OCCASIONS

Hawas Elixir: It’s sweet, spicy, and very ""loud."" This isn't for a quiet dinner; it’s for a wedding, a big party, or a night out where you want people to notice you the moment you walk into the room. It’s modern and very mass-appealing.

🏋️ GYM

Rue Broca Theoreme:  It’s zesty and sharp enough to cut through the smell of a sweaty gym without being ""perfumy"" or cloying. It just smells like you’ve got your life together while you’re hitting a PR. It last so long in the gym.

🎁 GIFTED

Ameer Al Oudh Intense Oud: This one is gifted by my friend who went to Saudi Arabia. It starts with floral notes and has absolutely different level of Oud that I've smelled nowhere before. It gives off that Sheikh Vibes.",1,1770014950.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False

1qtnsj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qtnsj2/canvas_of_carnage/,Canvas of Carnage,"I hate this school, everyone's the same. I tend to hide out in the art department that’s completely isolated from the rest of the school. There are several strange paintings here deemed inappropriate for the students. My favorite being the painting that depicts a skeleton taking a blood bath. It really speaks to me. The idea of bathing in the blood of your enemies really inspires me.



I read online that if I ever wanted to summon the devil I would need to do a blood ritual. I heard from one of the teachers that the painting is supposedly made from real blood. Legend has it that the artist made a pact with a demon to erase one of her memories. It's a hauntingly beautiful piece.



As I stood there, lost in my thoughts, the sound of footsteps approached. I turned to see Irvin, a dorky student I'd seen around before, making his way towards me.



""Hey there!"" he greeted with a wide smile. ""I've seen you hanging around here quite a bit. Mind if I join you?""



""Um, sure,"" I replied, somewhat reluctantly.



Irvin plopped down beside me, his enthusiasm undimmed by my reserved demeanor. ""So, what's your take on this painting?"" he asked.



""I hate this painting,"" I muttered.



""I wish they would just take it down.""



""Cool,"" Irvin said with a nonchalant shrug. He then reached into his bag, pulling out a small spatula and a scalpel. With practiced ease, he carefully used the spatula to scrape off a small piece of the paint from the canvas. I watched in surprise as he held up the sample, a mischievous glint in his eyes.



""Then you won't mind if I do this,"" he said. I couldn't pretend not to care about the painting.



""Hey, wait, what are you doing? What are you doing with that?"" I blurted out.



Irvin paused, his hand holding the small sample of paint mid-air. He turned to me with a quizzical expression.



""Why do you care?"" he asked, genuinely curious. I hesitated, grappling with my conflicting emotions.



""I... I don't really care. It's just a stupid painting,"" I lied, my voice barely above a whisper.



I watched him tuck the sample away.



""Alright then,"" Irvin said, zipping up his bag. ""I'll catch you later.""



With a wave, Irvin turned and headed towards the door of the art department, his footsteps echoing softly against the tiled floor.



As the door closed behind him, I was once again left alone with the painting.



The clock ticked. There was a note under my cup of coffee. Books lined the walls. Irvin plopped down across from me, too casual this time.

""You always sit here, huh"" he asked. Hands tucked into his hoodie pocket.

"" I like this spot, you can hear everything from here"" I said.

He dug in his bag. Pulling a tiny scrap of tinfoil on the table.

""“Go ahead,” he said. “Touch it. See what happens.”

I unfolded the tinfoil it smelled odd. My fingers hovered over the scrap.

""Nah, im good, what the hell is it"" Irvin leaned back

 ""Proof,"" he said. ""Blood. Mixed with paint. From the painting downstairs.



I leaned my elbows on the table, resting my chin on my hands.

""You're something else.... you know if the art department finds out, they will expell you right? You have brought heat the chillest place I know!”

"" Relax I'm sure it will be fine"" he said.



The PA system crackled.

“Irvin Jagr—report to the office immediately.”



Irvin grabbed his bag, hoodie swishing, and stood.

"" I'm sure its unrelated"" I snorted.

""Keep it safe,” he said. “Don’t do anything stupid.”

I nodded and flipped him the bird.



Now what to do with this obsessive love letter under my cup. I recognized the handwriting immediately. Clark. My lab partner.

He always pressed too hard with the pen. Like the page owed him something.



I slid the note out, skimmed it once, then folded it smaller than it needed to be. It wasn’t bad. Just… a lot. The kind of thing that looks harmless until someone decides it isn’t and in this shitty school it will spread like wildfire.



A chair scraped somewhere behind me. I didn’t look.

I tucked the note into my pocket anyway.



Bell rang. Chairs moved. Noise came back all at once.

I stayed seated until the room thinned out.



When I stood, the tinfoil was still there. I wrapped it once more, tighter this time, and slipped it into my bag.

Two things I shouldn’t be carrying.



The bio lab was still locked. I slid the spare key from my wallet. I always forget to give it back. The lights flickered when I flipped them on. I washed my hands out of habit.



The microscope was already out. One of the newer ones with the tablet attachment. Overkill for a school lab, but the school liked their toys. I pulled the tinfoil free and peeled it back just enough. 



I placed it on a slide. Added a drop of saline. Slid it under the scope.



The screen blinked on.



At first, nothing. Just texture. Cracks. Pigment clumps.

Then I adjusted the focus.



Cells.



“Lili?”



I jumped. Almost knocked the slide off.



Clark stood in the doorway, backpack slung over one shoulder. He looked tired. 



“You’re skipping club,” he said.



I didn’t answer. I didn’t minimize the screen either.



He stepped closer. Leaned in. Squinted.



""I cant see it without my glasses, whatcha looking at? water bears again? 



I slid the tablet a few inches away from him instead of closer.



“Hey, you wrote this?” I asked.



His eyes flicked to my jacket pocket before I finished the sentence. 



“Figured you didn’t want it making the rounds.”



He didn’t smile.  Just crossed his arms.



“Are you serious?” he said.



“Yes” I replied 



“You shouldn’t out yourself like that in this place.”

I muttered, stashing the sample back into my bag. “This school is … gossipy.”



He blinked. Then he started talking faster, almost tripping over himself. “I mean, it’s not like anyone else cares, —she’s so genuine and—she’s just so nice and funny, and I just—I didn’t mean for anyone to see it.""



""I dont appreciate your tone"" I scolded.



""Well I dont like what youre up to, its messed up."" he stormed of. 



It made me so angry, how dare he treat me this way.  I could have let it go there. That would’ve been the decent thing. But decency depends on timing, and  people who don’t plan ahead deserve to be put down.



I took out my phone and rang him.



""Clark where did you go, can you please walk me home?""

Mornings are dictated by light, not alarms. My “commute” is moving a coffee mug from the front seat to the back. Bad days are usually fixable with fresh air, a new view, or just driving until my brain calms down.

I have been meeting a 28 f NRI citizen via arranged marriage. I have met the girl and have been on 3-4 dates with her and it's fun getting to know here on the dates but these dates were very sparsely scheduled (every 2 week alternate or such). I have been the one scheduling these dates and contacting her first. She is great when we meet up and follows up when I ask her out for the next date but never reaches out to me first. It's usually complete radio silence between the dates. I added her on insta and we had a day of chat there but she then again moved the chat to text/sms. He discuss deep things when in person but she seems like someone who either does not reciprocate the interest or is a very very busy person (with the job, family, and dog?). We have never had a romantic/intimate connect, it being an arranged setup. I am not sure if she wants to move this forward or not. I would like someone who would ask me how my day went and stuff tbh. Recently, I did see her profile on bumble so I dont know what's going on with that. What should I do? I am thinking of scheduling a date and asking her point blank if she is interested or not. Need to clarify things before valentines?

edit - 1. forgot to mention. She did not pay on the first coffee date but did say thanks. Dutched on the second date (was a movie) but then did not pay/offer to pay on an expensive dinner date.

1qtnly6,https://i.redd.it/pxh3gb8l01hg1.jpeg,Coming down from actually living out one of my recurring nightmares for a whole week,"Already typed this out in detail once then it got erased when I got a phonecall, so here's a slightly abridged version.

Long story short, I came into work last Monday to find out literally everyone else at my job was leaving for the week, and it was on me to run everything and also meet all the deadlines my coworkers had already set for the entire 7 day stretch. This exact situation is a recurring stress dream I already have, though it has never actually happened before. Mental health deteriorated as the week went on. Working 11 hour days alone except for the constant flow of people at the front desk and 3 phone lines ringing, having to take the fall for every single one of my coworkers' fuckups they left behind, and getting overwhelmed with the workload and deadlines of an entire staff really fucked me up bad and sent my major anxiety disorder to the fucking moon. First panic attack was Wednesday, by Friday I was not eating.

This morning my boss came back and we had to do inventory, which is always the most stressful day of the month. I was shaking really bad and thought it was another panic attack taking its time until we realized the heat had gone out and I'm actually shivering. Don't know how long it had been out, I know I was shaking Saturday too. Fighting with the person I'm seeing because I've come to the independent conclusion that she hates me based on all my internal dialogues about what she must be thinking. I keep it together at least on the surface for almost the entire day, then in the last hour I start to fall apart. Boss gives me one last project to finish then says I can go home. As I'm working on it I start to have a meltdown, and I sit there trying to focus while violently shaking and trying not to cry too loud or hyperventilate too much in front of the boss. He must have noticed, no way he couldn't have. He thanked me in an uncharacteristically sincere and not sarcastic way. Couldn't look at him or talk without breaking on the way out, just gave him a thumbs up. Panic attack on the drive home, more once I got to my bed.

7 hours now since I got home. Talked it out with lady friend, we're on good terms. Heart rate is just now starting to go down, not light headed anymore, still shaky and ears are still ringing, still crying a little every now and again but a lot less than before. Have tomorrow off, then back to work Tuesday. Don't know if I'll actually go in.

1qtnhyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1qtnhyb/someone_is_breaking_into_my_camper_and_stealing/,Someone is breaking into my camper and stealing razors?,"My \[27F\] husband \[30M\] recently just got a new job in a neighboring city to the one we have lived the last few years. We plan on buying this year so we decided to go ahead and move. Since or lease was up at our old residency we decided to call a (we will call him Mike) who owns a RV park in the city my husband is now working  in who has a few RVs he rents out as like (air b&b/ hotels). Note to add: we have stayed here before. 

The owner “Mike” his camper is directly next to ours. When we moved in he didn’t have the key and we went a few days without it. We paid for the month and a week in I noticed some of the food I had bought just wasn’t in the cabinets. A lot of stress going on I thought it was misplaced while moving. 

Sometime in the middle of the week this a man (not Mike) knocked on the door and told me “I was told you have a sticky door” and brought WD40 to fix it. I told my husband and he in fact didn’t tell anyone because he planned to fix it himself. 

Over the weekend I told my husband to buy razors on his way home from work so I could shave that evening. We left to grab dinner and when we came back the razors were gone. Very weird but he thought he didn’t buy it or left it at the store. We checked the receipt and he in fact did buy them. And remembered putting them on my side table. We went back to the store to buy more razors. When I woke up the next morning my whole container of coffee was gone. At this point I thought my kids (3&4) were moving my things. The camper is very small so I looked EVERYWHERE for my food, razors and now coffee. I can’t find it anywhere. Today when we came home the door was unlocked and wasn’t latched properly. At this point I know for a fact someone in coming in and taking things. AND AGAIN THEY STOLE MY RAZORS! We always lock the doors. There is also a lot of other valuables inside computers, tablets, my wallet, a heater since it’s been very cold here etc. why steal just random things. 

Another note to add: when we came home today there was a neighbor looking out a window watching us come home.  

I don’t feel safe to stay but any idea why the little random things but not the things of value would be stolen? I feel like I’m going crazy and if it’s “Mike” we have no proof at this point. I don’t want cause a scene or wait for another incident. Just something to make sense of all of this would be great thank you. ",1,1770013709.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False
1qtnhin,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1qtnhin/my_manic_wife_was_prayed_on_by_a_convicted_sex/,My manic wife was prayed on by a convicted sex offender,"My wife and I have been married for 14 years and have 5 children together. I knew nothing about bipolar or manic episodes until she experienced her first one in 2020 and how we found out she was pregnant with our 5th. She had her 2nd manic episode after our 5th was born and even then she wasn’t diagnosed with bipolar because with the first episode they were considering pregnancy hormones, and then on the 2nd episode it was tied to postpartum hormones. After her 3rd manic episode she was finally was diagnosed with bipolar 1, and her most recent manic episode was right before Thanksgiving of 2024, and was the worse one, but more of what happened after.

I was always on her calls with her psychiatrist but because she hadn’t have a manic episode in 2 years the calls just became “how are you doing” …good “ok do you need a refill?” So if I was busy with work I would ask her if she needed me on the call and it was one time I wasn’t on the call she told her psychiatrist that she wanted to go off of her mood stabilizer because it made her feel numb. I wasn’t on the call so this is coming from her, but he agreed to since she was doing so well, or at least lower her dosage. I didn’t know about this but looking back I can pinpoint the change in her when she stopped taking them, she slowly slipped into mania short after. When I caught that she was in hypomania I got with her psychiatrist right away and he got her some serious anti-psychotics to bring her out of it. She started them that evening, but of course because she was in mania at this point and she wasn’t sleeping. I stayed with her all night to monitor her. I fell asleep at 5:30am and woke back up at 6am to get the kids up for school, but she was already gone. She left her phone so she couldn’t be tracked. I checked it and she sent a text to a friend at 5:58, so I literally missed her by a couple of minutes. We live in a wooded and field area and I searched for her with my neighbor in between getting the kids on their buses. After searching for awhile with no hope I finally called the police. Which I was nervous about because we’ve all seen the videos of a trigger happy cop and a person experiencing a mental crisis.

The police did arrive in full force and started a search and rescue complete with bloodhounds, atvs, side by sides, and drones. My whole property was covered in police vehicles, with probably 40-50 personnel involved in trying to find her. I didn’t know the police made a missing person poster for her until I started receiving what seemed like hundreds of calls, a lot from people who I haven’t talked to in years. She eventually showed back up to our house on her own and agreed to go to the hospital. This was the week before the week of Thanksgiving and she was released 2 days before Thanksgiving. Grateful she was with us for Thanksgiving but she was only in the hospital for a week which was about half the time of any of her other hospitalizations, and I believe she was released too early and wasn’t stable enough.

The following Saturday, about a week and a half after she was released, she sent me a text saying she wanted a separation and she wanted to be able to meet other people. This unfortunately is something that I have gotten used to but also knew she was still in hypomania, and she wasn’t in the right state of mind to make those types of decisions. So I responded with “I hear you. I think we should both write down our thoughts and meet with a counselor”. I wanted her to know I was listening to how she was feeling but also this was to buy more time as she became more stable. But I also started to notice a shift in her body language and she became more and more distant from me.

I own my own business and my hours and pay are usually all over the place and sometimes having to put 16-20 hour days for weeks on end. My wife doesn’t work and stays at home to take care of the house and kids. I was up early to go to work on that Monday morning after she sent me the separation text and had the urge to go thru her phone while she was still asleep. Which I found hundreds of deleted texts to a single number that I was able to recover. After her release from the hospital she started writing a lot and posting it on social media. Most of it was nonsensical manic jargon, but this person behind these deleted texts reached out to her and told her how much he enjoyed her writings and how much they spoke to him. The texts started out harmless but quickly moved into something more. He started questioning our relationship and she shared our struggles. She wrote the script for him and he took full advantage. Within a matter of 4 days, he convinced a married woman, with 5 children, who was just released from the psychiatric hospital a week prior to basically leave her family and for them to be together.

The big issue was this wasn’t an online person thousands of miles away, but this was a local person who lived and worked nearby. They were supposed to meet for the first time hours later than when I found out, I was going to confront her about it but after she woke up I quickly realized she was still in hypomania and changed my approach. I came up with an excuse to stay home and was able to convince her not to go meet him who she was telling me was just a friend she was meeting for coffee and they were going to help her with her writings. As the next couple of days unfolded she became more and more distant from me and closer to him. I didn’t want to expose I knew about them and their plans out of fear she would better hide her conversations with him and I wouldn’t be able to stay ahead of them. He had her eating out of his hand, even later I found out he convinced her to stop taking some of her medication and she was slipping back towards mania. I was also driving myself insane of trying to get access to her phone any time I could, which she was now being very possessive of and it was getting harder to get a hold of. I wasn’t sleeping and was still trying to run the house normally with our kids to not tip them off either. I was constantly on the phone with various people but mostly with her sisters, one who lived on the opposite side of the United States than us who came up with the idea to have her go stay with her for awhile. I proposed this idea to my wife but framed it more as a chance to go visit her sister, which she excitingly wanted to. This was to be able to give myself a break, to get her physically away from this person, and once again give her more time to stabilize.

When this person found out she was going far away for awhile he changed his tone towards her and started getting very upset, he even reached out to me directly about it. The day she left I met with some of her closest friends to tell them what was going on. One of them had deeper access to background checks and found out that this person was a registered sex offender for pedophile offenses. I believe he saw my wife’s missing person poster and when he saw her writings he was able to connect to dots and prayed on her. This sent me into a huge panic because I didn’t know if he was after my wife or children. I set up cameras covering every angle of my house, met with the police and attorneys for me to gain full custody of the kids if need be, and came up with a plan before exposing this information to her. Which at this point she wanted nothing to do with me, and barely would talk to me and when she did was super angry with me. We set up a phone call with her sister, her sister’s husband, my wife and myself, where we told her about what we learned and who this person actually was. Which thankfully she was in shock and in full support of allowing us to cut off communication with him, she handed over her phone and my brother in law put several things on her phone to block him and any other possible ways he would try to get back in touch with her. When this person realized what was going on he reached out to my sister in law that my wife was staying with, told her he knew where she lived which he read her address to her and threatened her, and her family and that he was coming to get my wife.

My wife stayed there for a couple more weeks to process this, and to become more stable before returning back home. It was a long struggle after that of her coming out of mania, and dealing with what had happened and her emotions with that situation and with him. We started seeing a new psychiatrist who was able to get her stable and on a good recovery plan. Part of that recovery plan was no contact with this person ever again. A little over a year has passed and I just recently found out she reached back out to him and they basically picked up where they left off, and that they did meet up in person, where she later told me when they met some physical affairs occurred. We had discussions that if she was to get back in contact with him that this was my hard line, that I would take this as a direct threat towards the safety of our children, and she knew she crossed that line. I told her that she needed to leave the house and that she was going to stay at her parents who live 4 hours away. She has since cut off contact with him and we even changed her number in hopes he’s not able to contact her in the future. But she was the one who reached back out to him and my worry is will she ever do it again?

She had the expected response and blamed it all on me and that she hasn’t been attracted to me or wanted to be with me for years. Which she told me multiple times she wanted to leave me, but this also all started around the same time as her first manic episode. I always took this as to not be (fully) true and that if I could just provide her a safe place to become stable she’d realize this and realize what she would lose if she did leave. Which for her without working, it would be everything. But I didn’t want her to lose those things, that I love her more than anything in the world and wanted her to just get better enough to realize everything she would miss including her children. Even now I forgave her and wanted her to come back home and for us to work on repairing our relationship.

I took years of mental abuse, and constantly being blamed for all her issues, and not having an emotionally supportive partner, in hopes that one day it would just click for her. I used to take this personal and listen to her and convinced myself I was the issue. I used to blame myself for her manic episodes and think I was the one that caused them, or if I could just have done things a little differently, none of this would have happened. I’ve since done a super deep dive into bipolar and learning everything I can, to better help her and help myself on how to handle living with bipolar. I’ve listened to hundreds of hours of podcasts and lectures from psychiatrist specializing in bipolar in hopes there was just something a little more I could do to help her. I’ve always told her and looked at bipolar no different than a physical condition like cancer, and I wouldn’t leave her if she had cancer, nor would I leave her for having bipolar.

Everything was completely different before her first manic episode. She loved her life, she wanted to be a stay at home mom raising her children, and she loved me. So I learned to live with it and what I had to go thru just to be able to provide her a safe place in what I convinced myself that one day she would get well enough to just “snap out of it”.  I thought the most important thing to my children was to still have their mother around, but a lot of the time she was not really present, but convinced myself that things would eventually get better, and it was my duty as her husband to protect and care for her until that day came.

I used to come on bipolarSO and read stories from others who were going thru similar things for support. But I would always have to stop reading posts because it was never a happy ending and I swore that we weren’t going to be like all those other stories, and we were going to come out on the other side as the happy ending to a bipolar story. Things overall have been moving in a positive direction since she has been at her parents. She was started to take accountability, and realizes there’s other things inside her mind that she needs to get straighten out. We agreed to couples counseling and both want to work on repairing our relationship, but even tonight she told me she wanted to get another opinion from a different psychologist, “one who will see things from her side” and that she doesn’t fully believes she has bipolar. And it just feels like it’s just another step back.

Her psychiatrist did make changes to her medication because she was showing signs of hypomania and she was self medicating with more drinking than I realize. So the plan was to have her stay at her parents until she detox and gives her body more time to adjust to her medication changes. But I’m starting to change my view as to if this will ever get better, or are we just going to continue this cycle once every year or so and have to tell the children that mom is going away for a bit and we don’t know when she’s coming home, and what that does to them. I am also so physically and emotionally drained from this, and the amount of work, time, and energy this has taken from me and from our family. I’ve poured everything I have into this and any resource I could come up with to helping her get better and to keep our family together. I’m not yet losing all hope, and understand her fragile state right now, but also not sure how much I can take or continue to put our kids thru. Looking for advice from those who have gone thru this, or similar situations because I’ve tried everything else, and my optimism is starting to fade.",2,1770013667.0,BipolarSOs,1,1.0,False

___

**October 12, 103 A.R. (ARK Military Calendar)**
**Command Center, Outpost.**
**J. Doherty Jr.**

**3 days before the expedition to Leviantan's Zone.**

The static hum of the television was the only thing filling the silence, casting flickering lights over the empty liquor cans littering the table. What was supposed to be a little alone time to unwind ended up turning into... _this_.

It caught me off guard, though, to be honest, I should have seen it coming. For a while now—or maybe even since the day I met her—she’s been letting cracks show in her facade. It was like sitting next to a pressure cooker ready to blow at any second.

Maybe it was everything we've been through lately. Or maybe the constant life-or-death situations had kept her distracted enough not to face those thoughts until now. Maybe that was the only reason she kept taking missions and requests from the Outpost, even though she always complained about the work.

_Just like me back then..._

I approached the sofa slowly. The furniture creaked and dipped under my weight when I sat down next to her. I let my shoulder bump gently against hers; a light knock, barely a touch, to let her know I was there. That I was something she could lead on.

—Is that why you want to stay behind? —I asked, breaking the gloom.

Anis didn't look at me. She hugged her knees tighter, staring at the floor.

—Yeah... —Her voice was a fragile thread—. If I keep going like this, if I keep denying myself... I'll just be a burden out there. I'll keep running in circles in the same spot over and over, while the rest of you keep moving forward.

A heavy silence fell between us after that. I searched for the right words, but my mind went blank. Or rather, my own conscience forced me to shut up.

_Playing the savior again... idiot._

As if a few simple words of encouragement could change reality? I already tried that path with Crow and failed. I wasn't going to stumble over the same stone twice. Not with her.

I glanced at her sideways. Her expression was empty, almost hollow. Her eyes were fixed on the darkest corner of the room, as if her worst fears were being projected there. Seeing her like that sent a chill down my spine.

_Was that... the same face I used to make?_

In that moment, Hood's voice rang loud in my head, an echo from the past slamming right into the present.

_It's like you've forgotten how to live._

Live... yeah, that might be the case. And if so, no cheap comfort will work now.

But even so, I can't let her keep sinking into that pit.

_So... let me use my own scars to guide you, even if just a little._

—This morning, when you said you wanted to stay behind, I actually felt sad —I admitted, looking at my own scar-covered hand—. I'd say I was even annoyed. I didn't agree with us splitting up, I foolishly thought I could help you...

I paused, listening to her ragged breathing and watching her knuckles turn white as she clenched her fists.

—But after what you told me, I think it's best if you handle this yourself. Because you're right, Anis. Sometimes there is no middle ground. Sometimes there is no ""why"" to everything we do, or to everything done to us.

The grip of her hands relaxed slightly. Anis turned her head, just a few millimeters, listening.

—Sometimes it's just that: enduring —I continued, lowering my voice—. And waiting for it to stop hurting, even if only for a brief moment.

Her gaze followed mine. There wasn't a single inch of skin that didn't tell a story of violence. 

For years I was guided by hate, by emptiness, by loss. Without direction or purpose, I made mistakes, I hurt people who cared, and I even betrayed those I called family.

—But if there is one thing I can tell you, it's that even if you turn yourself to stone, things won't stop hurting. I say this from experience. I've spent most of my life trying to be made of steel.

I reached out and gently rapped my knuckles against my armor's helmet, which was resting on the coffee table. 
The sound was dry, metallic, _lifeless_.

—And to be honest, it never gets better. Because even steel rusts. Even stone erodes over time. And what comes after... ***the nothingness***... is far worse than the pain.

I sighed, letting my head fall back against the cushion, staring at the ceiling of the room and let the memories of those dark days come back to me.

—At the end of the day, war, pain... it can all be absolute shit. But feeling it also serves to let you know that... you're still alive. And even if life sucks, as long as you still feel part of it, you still have a chance to change things.

I straightened up and looked directly at her, even though she was still avoiding me.

—If I could do it, I know you can too. But you'll have to do it your own way. Because it doesn't matter how many times a hand is reached out to you... if you aren't willing to take it, you'll stay in the same hole forever.

The silence returned, but this time it felt different. Less oppressive. More shared.

Slowly, I felt a weight settle against my left side. Anis let her head drop onto my shoulder.

—Thank you, Commander... —she whispered, almost inaudibly.

That was all she said, followed by the muffled sound of her crying. I felt her fingers seek mine, clinging to my hand with desperation.

I didn't say anything else. I just stayed there, holding her. Because that is all I can do for her right now.

_I just hope you find the answers to your questions, Anis..._

1qtnfc2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qtnfc2,I built a mobile web app to monitor and interact with Claude Code IDE sessions remotely,"    I often run long Claude Code sessions in VS Code and got tired of sitting 
    at my desk waiting. So I built a small web app that lets me monitor and 
    send messages to Claude Code from my phone.
    
    **How it works:**
    - Connects to VS Code via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)
    - Captures the Claude Code webview HTML in real time
    - Serves it as a mobile-friendly PWA with WebSocket live updates
    - You can type and send prompts directly from your phone
    - Push notifications when Claude responds
    
    **Key features:**
    - Live snapshot of your Claude Code conversation
    - Multi-tab support (switch between cascades)
    - Remote message injection (send prompts from mobile)
    - User/assistant turn detection (7-strategy cascade)
    - Works on any device on your local network
    
    **Setup is simple:**
    1. Launch VS Code with `code --remote-debugging-port=9222`
    2. `npm install && node server.js`
    3. Open `http://<your-ip>:3000` on your phone
    4. Use VPN such as tailscale or zerotier to use it from another network.
    
    GitHub: https://github.com/khyun1109/vscode_claude_webapp

How should I handle this?,"Hi everyone. I’m 26M and my girlfriend is 40F. I’m looking for advice on how to think about a situation that happened in my relationship.

Over time, I started noticing that after having coffee/drinks around my girlfriend, I would sometimes feel very different than normal (restless, anxious, fast heartbeat, trouble sleeping). At first I didn’t connect it to anything specific. After it happened more than once, I looked up possible causes and the symptoms I was feeling were similar to Adderall side effects.

I didn’t confront her right away because I wasn’t 100% sure. I gave a hint that I felt something wasn’t right and that I was noticing changes. After that, it stopped for a few weeks.

Later, it happened again. I stepped away to the bathroom and when I came back, I drank coffee that she had been around/handled. I felt the same symptoms again. This time I asked her directly about it.

She admitted that she had put Adderall in my drinks without telling me. She said her reason was that she wanted me to spend more time with her and she liked how I acted when I was on it. During the conversation, things got tense and emotional. I asked her to apologize and take responsibility, and she said she didn’t want to say anything at first because she regretted what she did. After knowing this what is the best approach for this? 

TL;DR: My girlfriend admitted she put Adderall in my drinks without telling me because she wanted more of my time and liked how I acted. I’m unsure how to move forward or whether trust can be rebuilt.",24,1770012916.0,relationships,36,0.71,False

Marcus tore through the forest like a shadow with teeth.

The moon drew thin silver ribbons across his back as he ran, each stride shaking dew from the sleeping ferns. In wolf form he was enormous—larger than anything the forest had ever birthed naturally—muscle bound to muscle, his midnight fur streaked with darker markings that pulsed faintly with something ancient.

He ran because the dream chased him harder than any enemy ever had.

Flames.  
 A boy’s scream.  
 Hands reaching—then slipping away.

Every time he blinked he saw the moment his mother had died too: the witch who had given him life and taken her own to save his. Her magic had overwritten his wolf’s death spiral, binding the vampire’s immortality into him at the cost of her last breath.

Hybrid.  
 A curse.  
 A salvation.  
 A wound that had never closed.

Tonight the memory returned sharper, almost lucid, and he fled it the only way he knew—on four paws, until the world blurred and the ache in his chest dissolved into motion.

He burst through the treeline behind his mansion, claws tearing earth as he slowed. The estate sprawled out before him: stone pathways, lantern-lit archways, a winding garden laced with night-blooming flowers his mother once tended. Past the hedges lay the pool, its surface black and mirror-still beneath the early dawn.

He reached the back gate, the one only his family used to enter. The iron latch clicked softly when he nudged it open with his muzzle.

Pain, familiar and swift, rippled through him — bones lengthened, twisted, reformed; fur receded into skin; the monstrous shape collapsing back into the sculpted lines of a man.

His shredded clothes remained in tatters on the path.  
 He inhaled, breath shaking.

Human.

Naked.

Cold air slid across his skin as if the night itself wished to claim him.

He stepped through the garden barefoot, passing the old stone bench where his mother once read her spell journals, passing the cracked sundial his father carved. All ghosts now—scattered across the world or buried beneath it.

His mansion rose ahead, three stories of black stone and glass glowing softly from interior lights set on timers. Too big for one man. Too quiet. Too full of memories that refused to fade.

He grabbed a robe from a hook by the poolside entrance and shrugged it over his shoulders before entering the hallway. Wet footprints followed him over the marble floor.

He made his way to the mirror in the bathroom. Amber eyes stared back—wolf and vampire in one body—haunted by flickers of flame he couldn’t fully remember, and a brother’s face he’d never been allowed to forget.

*One day, the truth will return,* he told himself.

But not today.

# Morning

The city waited miles away, buzzing, demanding, alive. New York was a tempting setting, but the region he dominated—a neon-washed, nightlife-soaked metropolitan sprawl called **Eclipse City**—fit him better. A city that didn’t sleep because its predators didn’t.

His property empire towered in its center: a sleek twenty-floor building of dark metal and glass. The bottom levels were filled with restaurants, coffee shops and public workspaces. The top floor—his—oversaw it all with a panoramic view of the skyline.

And a block away stood **Magnifique**, his most profitable club, a cathedral of heat and music, famous for its male performers and high-paying clientele.

He showered, dressed, and let the robe fall to the floor.

The man who stepped into his suit was not the creature who ran through the forest hours ago.

Six-foot-five.  
 Steel-hard physique under tailored fabric.  
 Square jaw, clean-shaven, carved cheekbones, and amber eyes that could compel truth with a stare.  
 A suit that embraced him like a crown—dark, perfect, unforgiving.

He drank his coffee black, standing by the tall windows of his bedroom.

He should not still feel the echo of that dream.  
 He should not still hear fire.  
 He should not still remember the way his mother whispered his name as she died binding the vampire half into him.

But the ache lingered like ash beneath his ribs.

He exhaled sharply.

Later he had interviews—including the one for his new assistant.

He preferred efficiency, not softness. Predictability, not warmth.

He hoped today’s candidates understood that.

# Aurora — Before the Interview

Aurora sat at the kitchen table of her small 2BHK apartment, hair damp from her shower, legs tucked under her as she ate a sandwich and scrolled mindlessly through her phone. Sunlight pressed through the curtains in faint squares.

A morning like any other.

Except today mattered.

“Do NOT tell me you're still nervous,” Lindsey called from the hallway, her voice sweetened with excitement and eyeliner.

“I’m fine,” Aurora lied. “I only checked the time… maybe twenty-four times.”

Lindsey emerged wearing a sparkly black mini dress with cutouts that looked like they’d been designed by someone who believed subtlety was a myth.

“Please. This outfit could get me free drinks in five cities. Meanwhile—” She gestured at Aurora’s tidy blouse and fitted skirt. “You look like a sexy librarian. Ten out of ten. Marcus Kline won’t know what hit him.”

Aurora nearly choked on her coffee.  
 “I don’t want to *hit* him. I want the job.”

Lindsey smirked. “You can want both.”

Aurora flushed. “Absolutely not. He’s my potential boss.”

“And also hot,” Lindsey added. “Rumor-hot. Billionaire-hot. Mysterious-hot. Tall and glower-y hot.”

Aurora groaned into her hands. “Please, stop.”

Lindsey snatched her purse off the counter. “Fine, fine. Go be professional. Afterward, we celebrate at Magnifique. The dancers tonight? *Art.* Living, breathing art.”

Aurora rolled her eyes but smiled.  
 She loved her friend.  
 She loved her messy, glitter-soaked optimism.

“Break a leg,” Lindsey said, kissing her cheek before heading to the door. “Or break his if he’s rude. Either works.”

Aurora finished her sandwich, gathered her documents, and headed out—heart fluttering like moth wings.

# The Interview

The lobby of Kline Tower gleamed like a promise: immaculate floors, warm lighting, the scent of roasted coffee drifting from the café near the elevators. People moved with purpose. Aurora stepped inside feeling simultaneously bold and too small.

She smoothed her blouse.  
Checked her hair.  
Pressed the elevator button.

When his office doors opened, Marcus was standing by the window, suit perfectly cut, posture a quiet command. He turned—and for a moment Aurora forgot how to speak.

His presence was gravity.

“Miss Hale?” he asked.

“Yes—yes, that’s me.” She sat when he gestured, hands folded, nerves tucked behind a polite smile.

“I don’t conduct long interviews,” he said. “Tell me what I need to know.”

His voice was smooth steel.

She managed her answers—organized, honest, determined—though every time his amber eyes flicked to her, her pulse jumped. She told him her strengths, her experience, the pressure she could handle.

She did **not** tell him his stare felt like he was peeling her open and reading the lines inside.

He asked questions fast. She responded faster.

And then—

“I’ll hire you,” Marcus said abruptly. “Start Monday. Probation for two months. Don’t be late.”

Aurora blinked. “I—yes. Thank you.”

He nodded once, already turning away—but something in his gaze lingered on her, curious, reluctant, caught.





# Magnifique — That Night

Later, Aurora stood beneath neon lights as Lindsey pulled her through the doors of Magnifique.

Music thundered.  
 Bodies swayed.  
 Heat rolled through the air like fog.

The elevated square stage glowed at the center, a spotlighted altar where men danced with shameless precision.

Aurora barely had time to protest before a dancer reached for her hand and pulled her up onto the center chair. Laughter bubbled out of her—nervous, breathless—as five performers circled her, guiding her hands to their chests, their hips, their sculpted arms.

Her face flushed a vivid crimson, pink climbing to her ears.

Then—

High above, in his private booth, Marcus turned his head.

He had come for a distraction. For noise. For anything to drown the remnants of his dream.

And instead, he saw her.

Aurora.

In his club.

On his stage.

Blushing like the world had dared her to be seen.

He leaned forward, amber eyes narrowing—not with judgement, but with interest far more dangerous.

Something shifted inside him.  
Something ancient.  
Something instinctual.

No plan, no rule, no promise he made to himself stood quite as firm in that moment.

Because fate had a sense of humor.  
 And it had just placed the one person he meant to keep at arm’s length directly under the lights of his world.

# Aurora on the Stage — Expanded Scene

Aurora barely had time to gasp before the dancer’s fingers closed gently around her wrist, warm and confident. The crowd around the stage parted like the tide, a wave of excitement sweeping with them as the performer guided her upward.

“Come on, sweetheart,” he murmured with a grin that was all showmanship and teeth. “Let’s make the ladies scream.”

Her feet touched the platform—just a single step above the floor, but it felt like a hundred. The lights hit her immediately, warm against her cheeks, turning her skin into a soft peach glow. Music throbbed through the boards under her heels, and the scent of cologne, sweat, and sweet alcohol wrapped around her like velvet.

A chair waited in the center. She sat because her legs didn’t trust themselves, her palms hovering awkwardly on her lap.

Then the other four dancers closed in.

They moved with a predatory grace, bodies swaying in slow rhythm, each step synchronized. Their shadows rippled across her legs, across the chair, across the stage. One brushed a hand across her shoulder, fingertips whisper-light. Another knelt beside her, guiding her hand to his chest—firm muscle under heated skin—while a third lifted her chin so she had to look at him as he rolled his hips in time with the music.

Her breath hitched.

Her face went pink, then pinker, then a deep, helpless crimson that made the nearest dancer laugh softly.

She wasn’t used to being the center of anything, much less this.

But a strange, fluttery thrill swept through her—embarrassment tangled with exhilaration. The dancers weren’t leering or crude; they were performing, giving her a moment carved out of confidence she didn’t know she had.

“THAT’S MY GIRL!” Lindsey screamed from below the stage, waving her drink like a battle flag.

The two other friends joined in, cheering at the top of their lungs as if Aurora were conquering a kingdom instead of surviving a lap-dance show with grace and blushing terror.

“Work it, Rory!”  
“Look at her! Oh my god—SHE’S GLOWING!”  
“TAKE HER HAND AGAIN—SHE LIKES THAT!”

Aurora covered her face with her palms for a beat, but the dancer beside her gently tugged her hands away.

“No hiding,” he teased, spinning her lightly in the chair so she faced her friends. “They love it.”

Her laughter escaped—light, breathy, helpless. The kind that slipped out before she could hold it back.

The dancers parted for a moment, then reunited behind her, forming a semicircle. Their movements framed her—each one slow, deliberate, designed to draw the crowd’s attention to the girl in the middle. One dancer tipped her chin toward his abdomen, guiding her hand lower along his torso, stopping before anything inappropriate but enough to make heat flare in her cheeks.

The women around the stage whooped. Even some men cheered.

Aurora felt alive in a way she hadn’t in months.

Not because she wanted the attention…  
…but because, for once, she wasn’t invisible.

She played along shyly—laughing when one dancer dipped in front of her, smiling when another spun around to show off a series of moves that made Lindsey shriek so loudly the DJ pointed at her from the booth.

It was overwhelming.  
It was ridiculous.  
It was **fun**.

When the music finally hit its last heavy beat, the dancers ended their formation with a dramatic pose around her—one behind the chair, two beside her, one crouched in front, another leaning in from the side.

The audience applauded, and Aurora felt her chest swell with a mix of embarrassment and pride.

Then one of the men stepped forward, offering both hands.

“Let’s get you down, beautiful.”

Before she could protest, another dancer moved behind her and scooped an arm under her knees. With practiced ease, two of them lifted her—one by her waist, one supporting her legs—carrying her off the stage like she weighed nothing at all. Her arms flailed instinctively, hands gripping shoulders that were far more solid than she expected.

The crowd roared with approval as they gently set her down near Lindsey.

Aurora stumbled, nearly tripping over her own feet, but Lindsey caught her, screaming with laughter.

“YOU WERE AMAZING!” Lindsey shouted. “Your FACE—oh my god—Rory, I’ve never seen you that red in my LIFE!”

Aurora pressed a hand over her chest, trying to steady her heartbeat.  
 “That was— That was— Oh my god.”

One of the dancers winked as he returned to the stage. “Come back anytime, sweetheart.”

Aurora turned away, face still blazing…  
 …and accidentally looked upward.

Her breath faltered.

In the private balcony above, shadowed but unmistakably present, sat Marcus.

Amber eyes locked onto her like they had been watching for far longer than she realized.

Not amused.  
 Not judging.

Just… focused.

Predatory.  
Curious.  
Cord stretched tight inside him.

Aurora swallowed, heart stuttering.

She didn’t know yet that what she did on that stage would echo far into the nights ahead.  
 But Marcus did.

And he didn’t look away.

# Marcus’s POV — The Moment He Saw Her

Aurora’s gaze lifted toward the private balcony, her breath catching midway—and Marcus felt the moment hit him like a shift in the air.

From his vantage point, half-shadowed behind tinted glass, he had been watching her far longer than she realized. Long before her eyes found him.

Her blush was a beacon.  
 Her smile—shy, startled—cut straight through the noise.  
 And her energy, soft but vivid, burned brighter than any spotlight in the club.

He didn’t move. Didn’t nod. Didn’t show recognition of any kind.

But inside him, something old and animal drew breath.

*Not amused.*  
 *Not condemning.*  
 *Focused.*  
 *Predatory.*  
 *Curious.*

A tension pulled tight inside him—instinct, hunger, recognition—but it wasn’t the hunger of his vampire side, nor the territorial dominance of the wolf.

It was something else.

Something he couldn’t name yet.

He watched as the dancers carried her down from the stage, her face red and radiant, her friends screaming like she’d just won a crown. Aurora stumbled, laughed, then steadied herself against Lindsey.

Marcus exhaled slowly.

She had no idea what she had woken in him.

But he did.

He knew exactly how this night would ripple into the next.





# The Command

Without lifting a finger, Marcus sent the command through the mental link shared with his wolves—his pack, though scattered, always present.

*Darius. Move them.*

A voice answered in his mind, deep and clipped.  
 *The human girl from the stage? And her group?*

*Yes.*  
 *VIP. Unlimited access. Food. Drinks. Make sure they are taken care of. No one bothers them.*

*Done.*

Across the club, a tall, broad man with subtle wolf energy—Darius—moved through the crowd like a shadow among shadows, approaching the group of girls.

Marcus leaned back in his chair, lifting the glass of whiskey to his lips but barely tasting it.

He watched the moment Aurora realized the man was speaking to *her*, watched her confusion melt into hesitant acceptance as she and her friends were guided toward the velvet ropes and ushered into the VIP section.

# Marcus’s POV — Staying Focused

Aurora’s blush was still lingering in his mind like the echo of a breath—but he forced himself to pull away from the sight of her.

Duty came first.  
 Always.

He sat back in the private booth with the other alphas, eyes narrowing as they finished laying out the details.

“…the body was found near the riverbend,” Dorian said, voice hard as the glass he held. “Pack territory. Inside our borders.”

“No tracks?” Marcus asked, swirling the amber liquid in his glass.

“Nothing.”  
 “Not a scent.”  
 “No signs of struggle.”

“And the wounds?” Marcus pressed.

“Torn throat,” another alpha said quietly. “Chest crushed inward. Spine broken. Not random. Not rage. Clean. Controlled.”

Marcus’s jaw tightened.

Controlled kills were signatures.

Signatures meant intention.

Intention meant someone had sent a message.

“Rogues don’t kill like that,” Marcus muttered.

“Exactly,” Dorian said. “This wasn’t a rogue. This was someone trained. Someone strong.”

Marcus leaned back, considering this with the cold, methodical part of his hybrid mind—the part that carried his mother’s magic in its bones and his vampire father’s instinct for violence.

“Double patrols,” he ordered. “Discreetly. No panic. And I want the body examined again by someone with witch knowledge. There might be spellwork we can’t see.”

The alphas exchanged tense glances.

Marcus’s word was law.

“Done,” Dorian said.

“Good. Update me when you know more.”

They shifted into another subject—territorial boundaries, upcoming meetings, negotiations—but Marcus answered only what he needed to.

He fulfilled every duty.  
 Asked every question.  
 Gave every command.

Only when the meeting naturally dissolved into casual conversation and friendly tension eased…

…did he allow himself to turn his head.

And look back at Aurora.





# Drawn Back to Her

She was in the VIP section now—exactly where he’d instructed Darius to place her.

Laughing.  
 Glowing.  
 Happier than anyone else in the room.

He watched her sit between her friends, raising a glass she clearly didn’t need, blush still on her cheeks from the dance. The lights caught in her wavy red hair, turning each strand into molten copper.

Lindsey was jumping in her heels, shouting something about “BEST NIGHT EVER!”  
 Chloe was whispering into a stranger’s ear.  
 Samantha was counting the cost of everything with wide, greedy eyes.

Aurora was simply trying to steady her drink.

A soft huff of amusement escaped him despite himself.





# The Girls Notice Something

Samantha suddenly leaned closer to the group.  
 “So seriously—who OWNS this place? Because VIP? Free everything? What is this, some rich bachelor’s playground?”

“Marcus Kline,” she added before anyone could answer. “Owner of Magnifique. And like, five other places.”

At the mention of his name, **Lindsey’s** head snapped up.

**Aurora’s** did too—instinctively, sharply—just before she tried to hide the fact she looked.

She glanced across the room…

…and saw him.

Marcus, seated in shadow, one arm draped across the back of the booth, watching.

Not intensely.  
 Not heatedly.  
 Just…

Attentive.  
 Interested.  
 Present.

Her eyes widened, breath stuttering before she quickly tore her gaze away.

She lifted a shot instead, as if that could undo the moment.

Marcus’s lips curved slightly.

*She’s trying not to think about me.*  
 *Which means she is.*





# Aurora Gets Drunk

Time passed.

Aurora’s inhibitions dissolved faster than the ice in her drinks. She danced with the girls, then alone, then with the girls again. She laughed at jokes that weren’t funny. She leaned on the table. She stole Lindsey’s fries. She hugged Samantha for no reason.

By the time the lights dimmed for last call, she was swaying in her seat, legs wobbling when she stood.

Chloe left first with a guy whose name she hadn’t bothered to learn.  
 Samantha found someone, too.  
 Lindsey disappeared into the arms of a dancer she had been flirting with all night.

And suddenly—

Aurora was alone.

She blinked blearily at her phone, trying to type her address into the cab app.

“…h-home… go home…” she mumbled.

But her fingers hit the wrong letters again and again.

She sighed, defeated, rubbing her face.





# Marcus Waits

She stepped outside the club, hugging her jacket around her as the cool night air rushed over her flushed skin.

Her vision swayed—

Then steadied.

Because a sleek black car waited at the curb.

And beside it, standing perfectly still, hands in his pockets, amber eyes reflecting the streetlights, was **Marcus**.

He had been there long enough for the engine to warm, long enough for two club-goers to whisper about him, long enough to know she would come out alone.

He watched her approach with the same calm authority he carried into every room.

He opened the back door.

“Aurora.”

His voice cut through the haze in her mind.

Not harsh.  
 Not demanding.  
 Not gentle, either.

Just final.

“Get in.”

She didn’t ask why.  
 She didn’t think to question him.  
 In her drunken haze, his presence felt like safety, inevitability—gravity itself.

So she slid into the back seat without a word.

Marcus stepped in after her, closing the door behind him.

The world outside faded.

Only the soft hum of the engine remained.  
 Only the faint scent of pine and leather in the car.  
 Only his presence beside her—solid, composed, unreadable.

The night had changed.

And neither of them fully understood how much.

# The Car Ride — Marcus & Aurora

Aurora slumped back against the cool leather, eyes half-open, head tilting toward the window as the car hummed to life beneath her.

Marcus sat beside her—not close, not touching, but his presence filled the small space anyway. The air shifted around him, thick with authority and something sharper beneath.

She blinked slowly, trying to focus on the passing streetlights outside.

“Where… are we…?” she murmured, words bleeding into each other.

“Taking you home,” Marcus said, tone steady. “You’re in no condition to walk or ride alone.”

“Oh.” Her brows knitted softly, like she was trying to process the kindness in that. “You didn’t… have to.”

“I did,” he replied simply.

He didn’t elaborate.  
 Didn’t explain that the idea of her stumbling through the city at night—tipsy, small, vulnerable—had made something primal flare inside him.  
 Didn’t admit that he had already memorized her scent from the club, the subtle sweetness beneath alcohol and perfume.  
 Didn’t say that leaving her alone felt wrong.

Aurora closed her eyes for a moment, her cheek resting against the seat.

Marcus studied her quietly.

Her breathing was soft, uneven.  
 Her hair fell in waves over her shoulders, catching the dull glow of the dashboard.  
 Her hands were curled gently in her lap, fingers twitching every so often as though she were dreaming already.

She looked nothing like the women he usually encountered at Magnifique—bold, painted, hungry.  
 She was… soft.  
 Not fragile, but unguarded.

A dangerous thing for a man like him to be near.

She stirred suddenly, turning her head toward him.

“Did—did you see me… on stage?” she whispered.

Marcus’s expression didn’t change, but something warm flickered deep beneath the surface.

“Yes.”

Her face heated. “That was… not… me. I mean—it was me, but not—me me.”

“You seemed to enjoy yourself,” he said.

Aurora groaned softly into her hands.  
 “I’m going to die when I’m sober.”

He didn’t smile, but there was a slight shift at the corner of his mouth—almost.

The car slowed as they turned onto a quieter street, lined with dim apartment windows and flickering streetlamps. Marcus leaned forward slightly.

“What’s your address?” he asked.

She recited it with surprising clarity, then immediately slumped back down.

He gave the driver a nod.  
 Only five minutes away.

Aurora’s head lolled to the side again, her gaze drifting toward him.

“You’re… not as scary as people say,” she murmured dreamily.

Marcus turned his head a fraction.

“Oh?” he asked.

“You… feel safe.”

For a moment—for the smallest, sharpest heartbeat—Marcus went still.

Safe.

No one had called him that in years.  
 Not since before the fire.  
 Not since before his mother’s last spell burned through her body to save his life.

He looked away from her, jaw shifting.  
 He didn’t know what to do with the word.

The car pulled up to her building.  
 A modest complex, clean but unimpressive.

Marcus was out of the car before she could try to stand.  
 He opened her door and held out a hand—not touching her, but creating a space for balance.

Aurora slid out on shaky legs.

Her knees wobbled.

Marcus moved with inhuman speed—one hand bracing her elbow, the other steadying her waist for just a moment until she found her footing.

Once she stood straight, he stepped back immediately.

“Thank you…” she whispered, breath warm in the cold air.

He nodded once.  
 “Let’s get you inside.”

She fumbled with her keys, missing the keyhole twice before finally managing to push it in.

The hallway behind the door glowed with weak apartment light.

She turned back toward him, leaning lightly against the frame.

“You’re… really not scary,” she mumbled again, eyes drooping.

Marcus looked at her a long moment.

Amber eyes unreadable.  
 Expression unreadable.  
 But something in his chest tightened before he could stop it.

“Go inside, Aurora.”

She nodded, stepping backward into her apartment.

The door swung toward closing—  
 but she paused, peeking from behind it.

“Goodnight… Marcus.”

For reasons he didn’t understand, the sound of his name on her tongue stole a fraction of the night’s cold.

“Goodnight,” he said quietly.

She pushed the door closed.

He waited.

He listened for the soft click of the lock sliding into place.

Only when he heard it—  
 only when he knew she was safely behind the door—  
 did Marcus turn and walk back toward his car.

The wolf in him paced silently beneath his skin.

The vampire in him watched the shadows.

And the man—the part that wasn’t sure what tonight had awakened—looked up at her darkened window one last time before disappearing into the night.

1. Yeongdo and Nampo-dong, which have clunky but deep taste, are completely different from Haeundae, a tourist destination. 


• Watda : When tourists look for wheat noodles, locals visit this place's ""Siji Hot Pot."" Chewy suji is enjoyed as a hot pot with a choice of soybean paste, kimchi, and clear broth, which is the best for breakfast or lunch.

• Pyongyang Jip : It was also recently introduced in a Michelin Guide, and the North Korean dumpling soup and mung bean pancakes are excellent. It's a hidden powerhouse that you must visit if you prefer a taste that's not irritating and neat.

2. Suyeong and Gwangalli are located right next to Gwangalli, but there are quiet and high-quality restaurants.


• Baekrihyang: It's not a fancy Chinese restaurant, but it has gone viral among the locals for its combination of machine noodles and Chinese food. The prices are nice and generous.

• Matna : the headquarters of ""Egg Dumpling,"" which appeared on ""Master of Living."" It's the standard of market restaurants that you can eat fully for only a few thousand won.

Long story short Im just ALMOST a 30 year old woman!! I would love to travel somewhere that requires a passport! I went to Cancun Mexico this past March for my man’s 30th birthday. 

I do still have to come up with a budget! I should’ve before i made this post. However im unsure of how much travel costs these days! I will be traveling with my man! He will be helping with the costs! As well as I’ll have a lot to put down for this trip! 

I don’t want to be somewhere that’s too hot to enjoy! Especially considering the fact it’ll be August! My birthday lands on a Monday so i would want to be somewhere the weekend leading up to it! 

Things i like to do while traveling:

\- eating, especially locally!

\- clubbing (i like to dance with my man!)

\- gentleman’s clubs (please only safe ones in safe areas)

\- excursions

\- sight seeing

\- napping 

\- drinking responsibly of course ;)

\- amusement parks 

\- spas

\- fine dining 

\- coffee shops

\- shopping/antique stores/boutiques/thrifting 

So much more, I just can’t think of anything right now at 1am. 

Huge NO’s for me:

\- roaches & bed bugs

\- high crime

\- dirty city 

\- being too far away from civilization 

\- extremely ridiculous priced things 

\- gypsies (i haven’t heard much good about them lol) 

\- pork

\- hurricanes/earthquakes 

\- racism, especially towards people of color! Like myself! 

Not a deal breaker, but I don’t want to go somewhere that Mary Jane is illegal!!! I mean I might if the country is really cool! Lol 

Really looking forward to some nice feedback. Excited to hear about countries and experiences!!! 

Please don’t be mean to me! lol!! 😅

1qtmrj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1qtmrj4/what_did_i_do_wrong/,What did I do wrong?,"A couple months ago, I met a seemingly great guy right before thanksgiving, we hit off with conversation  and he was incredibly impressive in the short time our paths crossed that evening.

We exchange numbers, mentioned meeting for coffee when our schedules aligned, etc. 

We live in a tri-state area but not in the same metro city. He shared his frequency to my specific town and that was that. Said he would “definitely reach out” etc. Was fairly receptive and reciprocating a small level of interest (an appropriately level of interest given that we were complete strangers).

The day we’d met, he shared a bit about his faith, passion for helping others, his respect for his mother/sisters, etc. So during one of the brief chat convos in the weeks that followed, I’d expressed that he was a gentleman but in a complimentary way, not I want you way and he said “oh wow”.

I’d reach out to keep the connection warm and at times he seemed a little overly neutral so I expressed one day that I didn’t want him to feel like he had to be polite in responding and that if he felt uncomfortable or disinterested in anyway, I would be happy to stop reaching out. Clearly giving him an out. He expressed neither was the case, he didn’t feel that I was making him uncomfortable at all and let me know he’d reach out when he back in town. We said ok.

Given his prior openness, I expressed via voice note that I didn’t know when our schedules would align to have us in the same place again but I wanted to know if he was open to taking more to getting to know one another. I said that I was shooting my shot platonically - as he seemed respectful, honorable, easy to talk to and someone worth knowing from the initial encounter. I expressed that I did a voice note because I didnt want anything to get lost in translation in text and made it clear I wasnt looking to do anything inappropriate and he was welcome to decline and I wouldn’t be offended.

If you’re asking, well why did you do that?: I know I could’ve skipped it or just waited (a lesson learned). In the moment, I simply wanted to be clear and pure about my intention and not ambiguous by continuing random reach outs. I didn’t want to come across as someone trying to cross any lines.

He ignored. I didn’t think much of it given how busy we all are around the holidays. A couple weeks later wished him a happy new year and he responded and wished me the same with the same tone and tenor as before. In the same convo, I said sorry if he felt I came on too strongly, he went silent.

Up to that point, my texts had been very generic and neutral (mirroring his) and not often, just a sporadic every now and then check in you’d have with a stranger; either following up on something practical he had shared or just a standard short and neutral opener to keep the door of connection open.

I never came on to him or expressed romantic intent or interest. My desire was completely platonic. 

A couple weeks later I had a chance encounter with someone very senior in his field that had done this entire speaking presentation on lifting the next gen up, helping young men advance in the sector, etc. While the senior leader was speaking, I noticed the alignment based on one of the goals the guy has shared with me the day we met. I let the senior leader know about him and they said they were more than willing to help him, mentor him, etc. I shared the senior leader’s direct contact information as he gave it for me to share with the guy. The guy responded and he was very neutral but thanked me and let me know he’d follow up on it. I wasn’t using it as an opener to relink up or as a strings attached gesture. I genuinely wanted to share the info out of goodwill, leaving him to facilitate that if it was something he wanted or could be helpful, irrespective of any connection with me. 

I let him have the last word and did not follow up further.

3 weeks later, I sent a generic “Hope you’re well. Reaching out to wish you a joyous and encouraging rest of your week. Nothing more. Take care.” text and was ignored. 

In the days after, move on but had reactivated my IG and saw him in the discover and sent a follow request (when we first met, he asked me if I had an IG), 

he watched my stories and immediately declined.

I then reached out via text to say, “Hey \[NAME\] — just wanted to clarify that the IG request came from when I sync’d my contacts, you showed up as a recommended. No intention to make you uncomfortable, in any way. I got the hint and respect it. Won’t reach out further. Wishing you all best.

(2nd text within the same convo):Also felt the need to say this just to avoid any misconceptions: If it felt like I was pursuing you, that wasn’t my goal. My interest was in purely platonically getting to know you, but I know that perhaps my eagerness was off-putting or misread. I apologize for how it may have been received or made you feel. All the best.”  
  
He ignored those also which I expected and wanted. I also won’t be reaching out further, have deleted the number/thread and blocked via cell and IG moving forward.

**I learned my lesson and WILL NOT be expressing interest going forward, initiating, etc in ANYONE FOR ANYTHING. I will leave things be.**

1qtmqt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qtmqt6/im_crying_over_my_friends_baby_photos/,Im crying over my friends baby photos,"Im crying over baby photos in my friends house. (Im 20 for context) Im sitting here, in my parents home after coming back from a sleep over at my friends. My house is a hell hole, constant tension, yelling, my sister and mom waking me up at 2am to have a screaming match in my room, my step dad sleeping in the basement to avoid my mom and sisters behavior. It’s soulless, a minimalistic stock photo. No dust, no family photos, everything is black and white even our animals. We have a few photos of selfies of us hanging on the wall but even those are edited black and white and they’re all recent photos. I haven’t gotten good sleep in months and I’m going through liver disease due to past medical abuse from my mom. My friend who lives an hour out by the ocean offered me a place to stay for the night. My mom refused to drive me but one of my friend just… sent me $80 for the uber without even warning me. I went at 11am, got there at 12. My friends mom sat me down, made me a cup of coffee, and my friend and I talked. Looking around the house I almost broke down. There’s family photos of cousins and nieces and nephews and my friend when she was a baby, the furnitures colors clashes and is antique, some of the lamps don’t work anymore they’re so old but they add charm, the dining table is covered in mail and take out menus which were not allowed to have in my house. The mugs are mismatched and from random family trips and merch from my friends nerdy interests. My friend I sat there talking about slenderverse, DND, video games, YouTube and their mom actually sat there and listened and asked questions. My mom anytime I talk about an interest of mine cuts me off and says I’m rotting her brain and she’s losing brain cells and not to talk about it again. I was being listened to without judgment, even if they weren’t interested personally, they still were interested in what I had to say. The house smelled like vinegar because that’s what they use to clean, it was 10 times better than the cheap name brand Lysol my mom puts in a smaller prettier bottle because she can’t stand the regular ones. The cabinets were full and messy, so much unlike my own where my mom puts each box of cereal or chips into a clear snack container, which is also black and white. 

My friend works the night shift at a 24 hour convenience store down the road and I was left to sleep on the couch. Their mom said I had free range of the kitchen and gave me water and blankets. Their dogs cuddled up ontop of me and I fell asleep. I have a lot of anxiety and trauma and I never fall into a rem, deep sleep. But god did I pass out, I have never slept like that before. Even when I’m sick I never sleep like that. My friend came home at 6am and I woke up to the dogs barking. My friend took me out to ihop, I’ve never had ihop. My family hates breakfast food, I thought I did too. But god was it delicious. We went home and slept some more and then I had to go home… I’m sitting in my kitchen at 1am, sobbing, because I have never had a home or life like that. Everything was so beautiful. I wish I had that life. I’m jealous… but in a way that makes me hopeful to have that for myself one day. ",2,1770011233.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Jintrax system, en route to the new orbital station—captured by Wyatt Staples and Cynthia Winfield after a brutal engagement that still left scorch marks on the hulls of their Raptors.

The same station Princess Clara Astor had traded to Uriel Holks on Woodshaft two years earlier, a calculated move in the endless chess game of Principality diplomacy and border security.

The Nori Navio completed its jump from Haego, the warp transition settling with a low thrum that vibrated through every deck. Sensors immediately began their sweep, hungry for threats in the quiet void.

Lieutenant Commander Gault Tirom ,

Redford locked onto the anomalous returns and opened a private neuro-link to Princess Clara Astor and Captain Wyatt Staples. His voice arrived clean and direct in their minds:

“Princess Clara, Captain Staples—possible pirate gunship detected, bearing ahead. Damaged signature. Second contact unknown. Recommending alert status.”

In Clara’s quarters, Wyatt Staples paused mid-stitch, the knitting needles frozen over crimson yarn. The neuro-link alert sharpened his senses like a blade. He met Clara’s eyes.

“Pirates.”

He set the project aside and moved for the door. It hissed open—Captain Milkades, cloaked and silent, already in position inside the room as Clara’s guardian.

Wyatt opened a dedicated neuro-link channel to the Composters squadron and Declan simultaneously:

“All Composters—gear up, to your ships.

Possible pirate gunship ahead, damaged but active. Second contact unknown. Launch in 20 Declan—hi alert. Notify your men, full readiness. Situation unknown.”

Acknowledgments pinged back rapidly. Declan: “Copy, Captain. Men notified. Bays prepping.”

In the mess hall, Gregor, Raquel, Leo, and Lt. Reyes rose as one. Nultar—promoted from the Composters to his own squadron because Wyatt and Redford deemed him ready—watched them go. Wyatt’s personal ping hit him: “Gear up. I want you with us.”

Nultar grinned. “Hey—I’m coming.” He sprinted after them.

Wyatt pulled telemetry from Redford as he jogged to the hangar.

Six Raptors launched into the black.

Wyatt: Raquel - Reyes—you are our eyes.”

and Raquel “Don’t get greedy.

Get a drone in there

Raquel: “I understand, Captain Staples.”

It seemed like hours but only minutes were ticking away

Raquel vectored in closer on the gunship wreckage

first.

“Composters 5 to Composter 1: closing on primary contact. Launching drone for detailed scan.”

The small probe detached from her Raptor, thrusters flaring as it streaked toward the twisted metal.

“Drone away,” Raquel confirmed. “Telemetry streaming… processing high-res hull imaging now. This is going to take a few minutes—faded markings, overpaint interference, encryption on old transponder ghosts. Give it time to clean up.”

Wyatt: “Copy, 5. Hold steady. Feed when ready.”

The squadron waited in tense silence. Minutes ticked by—three, four, five—as Raquel’s cockpit systems crunched the data: edge enhancement, contrast boost, layer separation on the crude red overpaint. Finally, her voice came back, laced with disbelief and dark amusement.

Raquel:

“Composter 1… We have faint life signs and you’re not going to believe this. Drone’s got clear hull markings. Marked : United Earth Transport Botany Bay. Crossed out in red, crude hand-paint job. New name underneath: Humanity’s Gift.

Sir… this is some kind of sick joke. Botany Bay—old Earth penal colony history, right? Convicts shipped off-world. And they slapped ‘gift’ on it like it’s charity. If this thing’s carrying exiles or worse, we might have a problem.”

Wyatt stared at the relayed holo-feed in his HUD—the faded UE T panels, the strikethrough, the mocking red letters. “Noted, Raquel. Keep eyes on.

That name changes things—diplomatic weight.”

Raquel: “Copy. Drone holding station.

I have a life sign

Life sign faint but stable. No other surprises yet… wait—hold on.”

Another pause, longer this time. Raquel’s breathing quickened slightly over the channel as fresh biometric data scrolled across her display.

“Captain… life sign is getting stronger. Readings climbing—heart rate up, neural activity spiking. Not just waking up. Looks like… maybe a stasis pod cycling out of deep freeze.

Bio-signs stabilizing fast. Whoever’s in there, they’re coming around right now.”

Wyatt’s grip tightened on his controls. He switched to a private channel  to Redford, voice low and urgent:

“Redford, you getting this? Life sign strengthening—Raquel says possible stasis pod activation. We’ve got someone waking up in real time.”

Redford’s reply came back immediate, calm but edged: “Copy, Wyatt. Bridge has the feed. Keep it calm. No sudden moves. Clara’s already pulling treaty clauses on cryo-transit vessels.”

Wyatt stay open mic

Wyatt : open mic copy

On the Nori Navio bridge, Clara leaned forward, eyes locked on the biometric overlay. “Stasis pod… that explains the faint initial reading. Whoever is in there is not just alive—but  emerging.

Raquel’s drone caught the power surge in the med bay.”

Cynthia: “Bio-metrics match human baseline. No anomalies. If it’s the pilot, whoever it is will be disoriented but functional.”

Redford crossed his arms, a faint grin tugging at his mouth. “Waking up to a squadron of Raptors and our ‘black ship’ circling? Poor pilot’s  first day back is going to be memorable.”

Clara:   “Keep the mic open. Let Wyatt handle contact. We listen.”

Back in the void, Wyatt keyed the squadron channel again. “All units, life sign confirmed strengthening. Possible stasis pod activation. Hold formation, weapons cold.

Raquel, keep that drone on the med bay window if you can get angle. We’re not alone anymore.”

Raquel: “Copy, Composter 1. Drone repositioning for internal view.

Thermal’s showing one humanoid form moving—slow, but deliberate. Whoever they are is  up.”

Wyatt exhaled slowly. “Alright. Let’s see who we’re dealing with.”

Clara’s eyes narrowed. “Milkades. Boarding party. Urgent. Two Royal Marines, two regular. Shuttle launch now.”

The shuttle—NN-0017—detached from the Nori Navio bay, two Royal Marines in  black- armor and two regular marines in tactical gray launching toward the derelict.

As the shuttle closed, exterior lights flared across the stranger’s hull. Voss, the pilot, stared at the illuminated panels.

“Composter 1, this is NN-0017. Hull markings lit up. Original name United Earth Transport Botany Bay—crossed out in red. New paint underneath: Humanity’s Gift. Sir… this is some kind of sick joke. Botany Bay was the old penal colony transport. Convicts shipped to Australia. And they called this a ‘gift’? If this thing’s carrying rejects or worse, we might need to rethink the approach.”

Wyatt, dry: “Noted, Voss. Keep it professional. But yeah… that’s dark even for Earth.”

Voss snorted softly. “Professional? Sure. Just saying—if this is their idea of a gift, I’d hate to see what they send when they’re pissed.”

Wyatt: NN-0017 confirmed by composter 5 minutes before

Again keep it professional

Voss: “NN-0017 copies. Prepare to be boarded for inspection

Kate, wry: why this is a earth ship we have treaties

Voss: “Investigating incident. Awaiting clearance to dock or approach.”

Kate: “Who are you?”

Wyatt cut in: “Humanity’s Gift, this is Composter 1. You are trespassing in Principality space. Copy?”

Wyatt: “Shuttle  hold your position

Wyatt Lt Hill ,: My name is Captain Wyatt Staples , Given the treaties and your status as a United Earth vessel, I’m not here to force anything. Would you permit me to dock my Raptor in your landing bay and conduct the inspection personally?

One person, can we agree . No boarding party, no weapons drawn unless necessary. Your call, Lieutenant Hill.”

Clara: Wyatt is learning to be a diplomatic.

Cynthia smiling

Kate: “Polite request from a Principality pilot? That’s a first. Alright, Wyatt Staples. Bay doors are opening. Dock when ready. Just you—no surprises. Or Cindy will lock the ship down

Wyatt : Cindy

Kate : my AI  - Oh I’ll meet you inside. And keep that sidearm holstered unless I give you a reason to draw it.”

Wyatt: “Appreciated. On approach now.”

Raptor settled. Door sealed. Drones clamped gear.

Wyatt exited the cockpit, boots ringing on the grated deck. He popped his helmet seal with a soft hiss, tucking it under his arm as the air cycled clean and breathable. The twin side arms at his hips—standard Principality issue for solo boarding ops, one kinetic, one energy—felt heavy in the unfamiliar gravity.

A soft voice filled the bay speakers:

“Hello, pilot. Kate Hill, United Earth. How do I address you? Lord? Sir? Nobility title?”

Wyatt blinked, caught off-guard by the casual tone. “What the hell—uh… Wyatt Staples is fine, Kate Hill.”

Kate stepped forward from the inner hatch, arms loosely crossed, golden hair catching the bay lights. She looked him over—steady, assessing, with a faint, amused curve to her lips. Her eyes flicked to his belt. “Great. Last time it was lord this, lord that. I hate that stupid title shit. Makes everyone sound like they’re auditioning for a bad holo-drama.” She paused, tilting her head at the dual holsters. “With two guns… are you compensating for something?”

Wyatt froze for a split second, then let out a bark of surprised laughter. “Standard kit. One for show, one for go. Or so they say in training.”

Kate’s grin widened, mischievous. “Sure. Or maybe you just like to be extra prepared. Either way, relax. I’m not the pirate here.”

Wyatt’s comms—still on open mic per standard high-risk protocol—fed every word back to the Nori Navio bridge. Clara, Cynthia, Redford, and Gault burst into simultaneous laughter, the sound echoing off the consoles.

Clara slapped the console, doubling over. “Compensating? Oh gods, she’s ruthless!”

Cynthia slid halfway out of her chair, pounding the armrest. “She just made Wyatt blush harder than a cadet on his first leave!”

Redford roared with laughter. “Two guns? Classic. Poor kid never saw it coming.”

Gault buried his face in his hands, shoulders shaking. “We’re never letting him live this down.”

Clara wiped tears from her eyes, still giggling. “We need to share juice and treats with this woman. Immediately. She’s earned them.”

Cynthia nodded frantically. “She’s my new favorite person in the galaxy. We’re sending her the good stim-juice. And cookies. And maybe a knitting pattern. She’s earned it.”

Redford, still chuckling, pointed at the audio feed. “If Wyatt survives this conversation, I’m buying him a drink. If he doesn’t, I’m buying her one.”

Back in the bay, Wyatt exhaled, shoulders dropping a fraction. “Believe me, I’m not fond of it either. Most days I’d rather be called ‘the guy who knits’ than anything with a title. But protocol’s protocol.” He glanced around the bay—clean Earth-standard lines, faint ozone scent . “You’ve got quite the welcome sign out there. Humanity’s Gift?

Raquel’s drone just pulled the full picture—Botany Bay struck through underneath. Old Earth penal colony name. Someone had a very dark sense of humor.”

Kate’s smirk deepened. “Not me . The name was already there when I woke up. Two years in stasis, and the first thing I see is that joke staring back at me from Cindy . Botany Bay was bad enough—old Earth penal transport legend—but slapping ‘gift’ on it? Someone out there thought they were clever. Or cruel. Probably both.” She tilted her head. “Your pilot—Voss?—seemed to get a kick out of it over comms. You all share that dark sense of humor, or is it just frontier standard?”

Wyatt chuckled low. “Frontier standard. When everything can kill you in new and creative ways, you learn to laugh at the absurd before it kills you. That name? It’s absurd. And a little ominous. Makes me wonder what else this ship’s carrying besides a very awake lieutenant who looks like she stepped out of a recruitment poster.”

Kate raised an eyebrow, stepping aside to gesture toward the inner corridor. “Flattery from a Composter? Careful, Wyatt Staples. I might start thinking you’re not here just to inspect. Come on in. I have Black Rifle coffee , and  it’s hot. And maybe I’ll explain why an old Earth hauler ended up in your backyard with a dimensional cannon that turns pirates into modern art.”

Wyatt followed a step, then paused, one hand resting near the holstered sidearms at his hip. “Lead the way. Just don’t mind if I keep one hand near my sidearms. Professional caution.”

Kate stopped, turned fully to face him, and let out a short, genuine laugh—light, teasing, but warm enough to cut the last of the ice. “Smart ass. Relax, Wyatt. I’m not going to bite you… much. And if I do decide to go full feral, I promise I’ll take those sidearms from you first—just so you don’t accidentally shoot yourself in the foot while you’re trying to look tough.” She winked, the blue of her eyes sparkling with mischief. “Besides, if I wanted you dead, the cannon would’ve already turned your Raptor into abstract sculpture.

Coffee’s this way. Try not to trip over your own paranoia.”

Wyatt’s mouth twitched into a reluctant grin, hand drifting away from the weapons as he fell into step beside her. “Noted. Lead on, Lieutenant. Just keep the biting to a minimum—I’ve got enough scars from pirates.”

Kate glanced sideways at him, smile lingering. “Deal. But only because you knit. That’s oddly charming for a guy who flies fighters and boards mystery ships solo.”

They walked the corridor toward the small galley. Wyatt’s comms—still on open mic per standard high-risk protocol—fed every word back to the Nori Navio bridge. Clara, Cynthia, Redford, and Gault listened in real time, holographic displays showing telemetry overlays.

Kate gestured to a table. “Sit. Coffee coming up.” She tapped a console. “Cindy, two mugs. Black for me. Whatever he wants.”

Cindy : send the manifest to what’s your ships name

Wyatt: Nori-Navio

Kate : who was the idiot that named it black ship .

Seeing Wyatt’s expression she points at him laughing

“On the nori navio

Redford hearing this live laughing I like this woman

I’ll buy her a drink”

Wyatt sat, visor on the table. “Black’s fine. Thanks.”

Kate leaned against the counter as mugs arrived via auto-dispenser. She took a slow sip, winced at the taste, then set the mug down. Her gaze locked on Wyatt’s, and the corner of her mouth curved upward in a slow, deliberate smile.

“I’ve been asleep for two years now,” she said quietly, almost to herself. Then her voice dropped to a playful murmur. “Would you like to go on a date? Or just some personal time alone?”

Wyatt blinked. Once. Twice. His ears turned pink, then crimson, the flush creeping up his neck like a slow-rising alarm. He opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again. No sound came out.

Kate’s eyes sparkled. She didn’t laugh—not yet. She just watched him flounder, clearly enjoying every second.

Clara slapped the console so hard the holo-display flickered. She doubled over, clutching her stomach, tears streaming down her face as laughter tore out of her in helpless waves. Go on a date “

Cynthia was no better—she slid halfway out of her chair, one hand over her mouth, the other pounding the armrest. “She did NOT just—” she gasped between breaths. “She did! She asked him on a date!” Spend personal time together . “

Clara managed to wheeze out words between giggles. “We need to share juice and treats with this woman. Immediately. She’s my new favorite person in the Galaxy

Redford, still laughing, pointed at the audio feed. “Two years in stasis and her first words to a stranger you want to basically go to bed

Cynthia, still on the floor, nodded frantically. “She just turned Wyatt into a tomato. We’re sending her the good stim-juice. Cookies. A whole care package. She’s earned it.”

Redford wiped his eyes, still laughing. “If Wyatt survives this conversation, I’m buying him a drink. If he doesn’t, I’m buying her one.”

Gault lifted his head long enough to croak: “We should mute before she asks what color yarn he prefers.”

Clara shook her head, tears still falling. “No. Absolutely not. This is the best diplomatic contact we’ve had in years. Let it play out.”

Back in the galley, Wyatt finally found words—hoarse, cracked, and far too high.

“I—uh—that’s… I mean…” He cleared his throat, tried again. “You’ve been in stasis for two years. I figured you’d want… food. Real food. Or maybe just to sit quietly. Not… not that.”

Kate leaned forward, elbows on the table, chin in her hands, grinning like a cat with cream. “Oh, come on. Two years asleep, I wake up to a squadron of fighters circling my ship, a polite pilot with two guns asking to come aboard, and the first thing I think is: ‘He’s cute when he’s flustered.’ Sue me.” She shrugged one shoulder. “Besides, you knit. That’s basically foreplay in my book.”

Wyatt’s flush hit critical. He rubbed the back of his neck so hard he might have left bruises, eyes darting to the deck plating, the bulkhead, anywhere but her face. “I… don’t know what to say to that.”

Kate laughed—bright, warm, unapologetic. “You don’t have to say anything. Just don’t faint. I’m not strong enough to carry you yet.”

On the bridge, Clara was gasping for air. “She called knitting foreplay. I can’t breathe.”

Cynthia wheezed from the deck. “We’re sending her everything. Juice. Cookies. Yarn. A whole crate.”

Redford raised his stim-juice thermos in salute. “To Kate Hill. May she never stop roasting Wyatt. And may he never stop blushing.”

In the galley, Kate finally took pity. She leaned back, still smiling. “Okay, okay. I’ll behave. For now. Where were we? Ok this is a seed ship basically

Everything for seeds to

Embryos , Heelers. Blue and red. Smartest herders Earth ever made. You’ll love them. They nip at heels to move cattle—gentle but firm. Horses fish squirrels everything . And most are Kind of like me.”

Wyatt nearly choked on his coffee.

The bridge lost it again.

Clara clutched Cynthia’s arm. “She’s relentless. I want her on every negotiation team.”

Cynthia, crawling back into her chair: “And we’re definitely sending treats. She’s earned them.”

Redford, still laughing: “Tell Wyatt to breathe. He looks like he’s about to pass out.”

Kate tapped the console again. “Cindy, pull up the Heeler files. Both blue and red. Let him see what real herding looks like.”

The holo bloomed once more: compact, muscular dogs with piercing eyes and coats like storm clouds (blue) or desert fire (red). They darted across simulated paddocks, nipping at the heels of cattle, turning herds with uncanny precision. One blue Heeler sat alert, ears pricked, tail a slow metronome. A red Heeler bounded alongside a horse, matching stride for stride.

Wyatt watched, color slowly fading from his face as fascination took over. “They’re… intense. Smart.”

Kate nodded. “Loyal to a fault. Work all day, sleep at your feet at night. Perfect for colony life.”

On the bridge, Clara’s eyes were shining. “Heelers! Australian cattle dogs—both blue and red variants. I’ve read about them in old agri-texts. They only shed once a year!”

Cynthia smirked beside her. “Like all year?”

Clara swatted her arm, laughing. “No, you monster. Minimal shedding. Low maintenance. Ideal for frontier stations.”

Redford grinned. “Clara’s already planning the kennel.”

The conversation flowed—Heelers , Welsh Corgi , other breeds, seeds to soil compatibility, terraforming challenges on Epsilon-7. Kate’s voice grew softer as she spoke of the planet she never reached: red dust plains slowly turning green, rivers carved by machines, the dream of a second Earth. Wyatt listened, questions growing more personal, less formal.

Then Kate leaned forward again, eyes glinting. “Before we get too serious…”

She tapped the console. Cindy projected a new holo: a crate of dark-glass bottles nestled in protective foam, labels faded but elegant—Earth vintages, pre-war labels still legible.

“I’ll trade you a crate of Earth wine,” Kate said, looking straight at the invisible audience on the open mic, “for an hour of his time.”

She winked—straight at the feed, straight at Clara.

The bridge detonated.

Clara shrieked with laughter, nearly knocking over the stim-juice thermos. Cynthia collapsed across the console, howling. Redford stood up so fast his chair spun backward; he walked three steps away, doubled over, still laughing so hard he couldn’t speak. Gault—calm, unflappable Gault—actually fell out of his chair, landing on the deck with a thud, clutching his stomach.

Clara, shaking her head through tears, managed to gasp: “She—she just—”

Cynthia wheezed: “An hour of his time! For wine! I’m dead. I’m actually dead.”

Redford, leaning against a bulkhead, could only wheeze: “She’s negotiating for Wyatt like he’s prize livestock.”

Gault, still on the floor: “I think I pulled something laughing.”

On the Humanity’s Gift, Kate watched Wyatt turn a shade of red previously unknown to Principality physiology. She laughed again—soft, warm, teasing.

“I’m kidding,” she said, winking at the open mic. “Mostly.”

Wyatt buried his face in his hands. “You’re going to kill me.”

Kate patted his shoulder. “You’ll survive. Probably.”

On the bridge, Clara finally caught her breath. She straightened, wiped her eyes, and keyed the comms—her voice still thick with laughter but regaining command tone.

“Wyatt,” she said clearly, “I need to talk to her.”

Wyatt lifted his head, startled. “Princess Clara Astor wishes to speak with you in person.”

Kate’s eyebrows rose. She looked at the overhead pickup, then at Wyatt. “Well, well. Royalty on the line.”

She tapped the console. “Cindy, shall I connect to their bridge?”

Cindy’s calm voice: “Affirmative, Lieutenant Hill. Connecting now.”

A soft chime. The holo-projector shifted, projecting a real-time feed of the Nori Navio bridge: Clara centered, Cynthia still wiping tears, Redford leaning on a console trying to look dignified, Gault climbing back into his chair.

Kate leaned in. “This is Kate Hill. I assume you’ve been monitoring this conversation.” She smiled—warm, direct. “So, Princess Clara Astor… hello. Can we talk?”

Clara, still flushed from laughing, returned the smile. “Hello, Kate. Yes—we’ve been listening. And laughing. A lot.”

Cynthia waved from behind her. “Hi! Still dying over here!”

Redford raised a hand. “Redford. Also dying. But in a dignified way.”

Gault just nodded, still catching his breath.

Clara cleared her throat. “We’ve seen the manifest. The seeds, the embryos—Heelers included. Blue and red. They’re extraordinary.”

Kate nodded. “They are. Tough, smart, loyal. Minimal shedding—once a year, if that.”

Cynthia snorted. “Like all year?”

Clara swatted her again, laughing. “Ignore her. They’re perfect for our frontier stations. Horses, cattle, the whole package… this is more than cargo. This is a future.”

Kate’s expression softened. “That was the idea. Epsilon-7 was supposed to be a backup. A second chance. I’m guessing your worlds could use some of that too.”

Clara nodded. “We could. Very much.”

A pause—comfortable, thoughtful. Then Kate’s eyes glinted again. She gestured to the holo-crate of wine still hovering nearby.

“Tell you what,” she said, looking straight at Clara. “I’ll trade you a crate of Earth wine—real pre-war vintages—for an hour of his time.”

She winked—straight at Clara.

The bridge lost it all over again.

Clara shrieked with laughter, nearly knocking the thermos over. Cynthia collapsed across the console. Redford walked three steps away, doubled over. Gault fell out of his chair—again—landing with a thud, clutching his stomach.

Clara, shaking her head through tears: “You’re impossible.”

Kate laughed—bright, unrepentant. “I’m kidding. Mostly.”

Clara composed herself, wiping her eyes. “Let me compose myself. Can you come over? We’ll get a tug brought out to tow your ship to Woodshaft for repairs.” She raised a hand, motioning for a brief pause.

She switched to a private channel. “Uriel Holks—good day. Can you send a tug to our current coordinates? I’m sure you’ve seen us jump in.”

Uriel’s voice—calm, efficient—returned immediately: “Yes, Princess. One will be en route immediately. ETA thirty minutes.”

Clara switched back. “Kate—the shuttle will pick you up. I promise no boarding party. Just you, Wyatt, and whatever you want to bring. And do you like grape juice?”

Kate raised an eyebrow. “Clara, do you like Nouveau wine? I have several cases.”

Clara shook her head, still smiling. “You’re dangerous. In the best way.”

She straightened, tone shifting to formal command. “Wyatt—this woman’s is under your protection. Treat her as you would me.”

Kate inclined her head. “Princess Clara—take your time with the shuttle. Say… an hour?” She winked again.

Clara and Cynthia exchanged a look—half-exasperated, half-delighted—and shook their heads in unison.

Wyatt, still faintly red, keyed his comms. “Shuttle—proceed and hurry.”

Voss’s voice crackled back, barely containing his own amusement. “Copy that, sir. On our way. Should I bring extra juice?”

The channel cut.

In the galley, Kate looked at Wyatt—still flushed, still stunned—and smiled softly.

“Relax,” she said. “I’m not that scary.”

Wyatt exhaled a shaky laugh. “You’re terrifying.”

Kate leaned closer. “Good. Keeps things interesting.”

1qtmofo,https://v.redd.it/8r24ijfcr0hg1,Espresso shot logging side project,"I’m working on CoffeeTune/CoffeeNetwork ( lol haven't picked a name) . Which is a side project early-stage web app for logging espresso shots and dialing in over time. Please shoot me a DM if interested in accessing the site.

I’ve attached a video showing how I am using it. Basically, before I would always forget the grind size when swapping between beans so I just started writing it on the back of the bag. A bit of overkill, but figured it be fun to make this website. 

Right now it can:

* Log shots (dose, yield, time, grind, machine, beans)
* Show your brew history over time
* Make it easier to see what changed when a shot got better or worse
* Allows you to enter in new beans, machines, and brews

At the moment, this is very much a personal side project and a work in progress. 

I’d genuinely love input on things like:

* What would make a logging tool worth using regularly?
* I want to add something to track tasting but haven't come up with something that feels right. It would be cool to know whether when I say something is caramel whether it is caramel to everyone else. That would help let me know whether the issue is the beans, me, or something else (lol the issue is usually me). Playing with the idea of setting a standard espresso pulled at a 1:2 on a specific machine then making every rating relative to that? For a standard thinking something classic like lavazza since it will likely stay the same over time (although personally I prefer more niche beans or for something classic Pilon or Bustelo).
   * Tasting categories? acidity, bitterness, body, sweetness, balance?
   * Notes & Aromas are really interesting. Thinking about whether it is better to be able to write free form entries then do a word frequency chart or to guide people through a tasting in a color wheel and then force people to pick certain words

So especially if you have experience with.. :

* non-monogamous relationship dynamics
* twin flame kinda-dynamics / journeys (anxious+avoidant)
* Fast starting,fast ending relationships
* well relationships generally



… I would really appreciate your view on this whole thing ! It will be a long one so I also understand if you dont get to the end of this paragraph :D





So we met and it all started super fast. Felt like ”I had always known him” - kinda stuff and it all went like the description of twin flame connection. We had really many similar expreriences, traumas etc. during life, it was little scary even how many times i find myself saying ”me too” & ”been there” when getting to known with him.



We both were in non-monogamous, \~6 years longterm relationships looking for other connections, neither have had anything more serious during our longterm relationships. Both relationships have been open over 3 years so either of relationships was not like new to non-monogamy so it seemed good & healthy situation.



He had this demanding career and was kinda famous in our small country, Slovenia. The level of famous you can be in small country, like people came to ask for photos when we were in restaurant. I got little anxious about that time to time, i think that was one thing that made pressure from beginning.



It was really intense and he wanted to spend his whole freetime with me and messaged a lot the days we didnt see. I was free whole summer so I had time to be with him, my longterm partner and with my friends, so I think I had good balance with that. But I feel like he didnt, sometimes he came straight to me from work and was there until some other work thing, u know. At first I was little freaked out about the fast pace and intensity because of anxious attacment style & fear of abandoment but still i was in it fast and decided to trust this.



We dated about 3 months, during this time he had less work stuff than usual. So I think also one impact was this ”holiday” time when he still had work but less than usual so he even had time for a thing like this.



His partner had other relationship , +2 years and I feel like our fling had maybe some effect on that. Because he spend so much freetime with me, his partner spended more than usual time with the other partner and they broke up. Of course there was some other reasons too for sure but I think this maybe made the process faster.



Well spending time together so intensively + other life, his work, my hanging out with friends made us both i think tired and sometimes we had difficulties with different energy levels, understantable.



Before starting the ”things went DOWN BAD- part of my story I want to mention that this seemed like an important thing for him also. He talked a lot about what activities we could do in the future so it seemed that this is going to continue in his head. He ”told me thing he had never told anyone before”.  He got jealous when i had coffee with someone else from tinder. He said that he is afraid this will go wrong and we talked about that together also. He said that he really can be himself with me. All those things that I remember all too well :D



So after these 3 months things had maybe felt a little off because we didnt see for a week maybe then we hang out and its all good & chill again f2f. Then maybe after a week he just sended me the coldest and I would say the CRUELEST (when looking at the relationship we had formed during 3 months) text message ever. Even my own partner got super mad when I showed it to him. It was like many different things in a list: we are not a good match, we are too different even tho we are so similar, something about the energy levels I mentioned before, like Chatgbt wrote message really. :D



We had a really long and good conversation even tho i was shocked and mad because I really felt just scammed. I feel like there was nothing i was afraid to ask. I even asked if his relationship or his partner relationship ending affected somehow to all this and he said no.



I feel like he was trying so hard to invent some reasons why this isnt working. And he seemed almost more devastated than me ?? Like he wouldn’t wanted this to end but he HAS to do it. I just dont get it if we are not a good match and his feelings have changed, why would he be crying his eyes out? I was really left with a feeling he didnt tell me everything or was afraid to say something and it bothers me. There was like the classic ”i have to focus on my work”- thing also, since his work started to be busier again. 



I also get the vibe that he ”wanted to protect me” and quit this before it would go even worse, I recognised this behavior from my previous relationship.



But I just cant understand why to quit a deep and relationship just like that. Why not to make it more casual, see rarely and still keep the good connection that we had?



We left our concersation in a place where we could talk again when this all feels less bad. I said I need at least a month to process this. Now its been 4 months and well I never messaged him, didnt know what to say really. I also havent had really any mood for dating anyone new because this thing was just so shitty from my pov.



I have heard this 3 months thing that its the first deal breaker-time in relationships and Im sure someone else has similar experiences also. I would be happy to hear them and get some input for this all like how this all sounds to you…

I attached a photo of his dad that I found recently, and he appears to be a jack Russel terrier mix. 

I think this actually explains Teach’s aptitude for learning commands so quickly, his bossy bark when he wants literally anything, his obsession with counter surfing (coffee table surfing is more like it) and the fact that he ends every day by sniffing the perimeter of the apartment before going to bed.

**Training**

* Gym **5–6x/week**, **1 full rest day**
* Morning sessions at **6 AM**
* **\~80 min strength + \~40 min cardio** (boxing / incline walk / HIIT)
* Strength is **consistently increasing** (adding reps or weight every 1–2 weeks)
* Cardio stamina also improving
* Only issue: **mild lower-back pain**, no other joint or fatigue issues



**Recovery**

* **\~8 hours of deep sleep** daily
* No constant fatigue, mood issues, or burnout



**Diet (\~1700 kcal/day | Vegetarian | Dairy-tolerant)**

* **Post-workout:** 30 g whey + 4 g creatine
* **Breakfast:** Sprouts + black coffee (poha on leg/low-energy days)
* **Snack:** 1 fruit
* **Lunch:** 80 g dry soya chunks + 1 bowl dal
* **Evening:** Green tea
* **Dinner:** 80 g dry soya chunks + vegetables
* **Before bed:** Milk + turmeric
* Add-ons: Paneer + roti a few times/week, multivitamin daily
* Hydration: **\~5 L/day with salt/electrolytes**



**Progress so far**

* Fat loss: **\~1.5–2 kg/week**
* Strength and conditioning improving
* No cravings, binges, or adherence issues



**Goal**

* Continue fat loss while building a **lean, athletic physique** (not extreme cutting or bulking)



**Questions**

1. Is **1700 kcal** reasonable long-term at my age and bodyweight if performance is still improving?
2. Would **slightly increasing carbs** (without raising calories much) help recovery and strength?
3. Any suggestions to manage **mild lower-back pain** during a cut?

1qtmaai,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qtmaai/need_advice_regarding_third_date/,Need advice regarding third date,"Hey y’all,

I (23M) have been seeing this girl (21F) for about a while now. We have met twice in person; once for a super brief coffee chat and the second date was a dinner about 3 hours long. I think we have a lot in common and conversation is pretty easy when we are in person. We’ve had very limited physical intimacy so far (hand holding is as far as we have gone). I also tried to lean in for a kiss on the second date at the end but she didn’t seem to want it, so I respected that immediately and backed off.

However, the texting is pretty inconsistent and Idk, feels less “easy”? We never text each other synchronously, and we also clarified that we’re both big time texters but take time to get to that point. I assumed the second date would be that point but it apparently isn’t.

Anyways, I have some questions: I have been initiating and paying for all the dates so far. Do I wait and see if she wants to ask to see me again? (this would be our third date). Also, I haven’t gotten as far as a third date in a really long time, I would just need some advice on how I should proceed with it.

I just genuinely can’t tell if she’s into me, there seems to be inconsistencies between our in person interactions and anything online. What do people generally do? What are some things you’d get clarified on a third date? Should I reach out yet again? Is this a good time to discuss what her intentions are with me etc?",1,1770009760.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1qtm9i3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qtm9i3/blackout_zone_five/,Blackout Zone Five,"Honestly when I mention this to people, no one else seems to remember this. I’m not sure why this seems to linger in my mind every night. When I mention the riots in 95 they talk about the riots in LA.

They don’t remember the sirens screaming all night. They don’t remember the men in gas masks knocking on every door, telling us to leave. The shortages, the fear, the paranoia, the evacuations of entire cities, almost the whole state. 

I was one of the few who stayed, some couldn’t leave for other reasons. Some chose not to leave. Sometimes I would find their doors broken down and their bodies shredded like sheets of paper. As for me, I stayed because I had a new job to do.

They call us collectors, in reality we just go off whatever names they give us. Some call us vultures. Usually people are desperate enough or crazy enough to collect samples and intelligence from the quarantine zone for the eggheads or uncle sam. Some of us lived colorful lives. Some were given a choice of prison or being a collector. Some of us were contractors before this or washed up veterans or ex cops. As for me, I had my own reasons.

They send us in by ourselves or in pairs if they feel like we’re important. I wish I was that lucky but then again, luck has never been my strong suit. Then again when we’re not doing Washington’s dirty work we’re holed up somewhere, licking our wounds out of the cold. Some like to make their own little hideouts in the nooks and crannies, as for me. I always believed in safety in numbers, plus they tend to attack groups of people. 

I tended to shack up in this big church, some other collectors were there every now and again. Usually it was just me, the pastor and a few vagrants who had nowhere else to go, no one else to turn to. It was a nice spot actually, the pastor always kept the fire going, and had some beds set out in the main worship area. 

It was like any other day in this hellhole of a state. I was sitting by the fireplace on a cushion with a cup of coffee cradled in my hands, instant of course. But hey I take what I can get. Despite the coffee tasting like a combination of charcoal and gas with the absence of sugar. I took another sip as I glanced over my shoulder to see a few people huddled in blankets with lit cigarettes hanging from their chapped lips. I glanced out the warped window to see the snow was starting to pick up, snowflakes began to gently tap the window.

I was just about to finish my coffee when I heard the distinct sound of my pager chiming. I groaned as I dug into my pocket for it and glanced down at the miniscule screen to see a radio frequency to tune into. I gulped the last of my gritty coffee and trasped over to my bag to my SINCGARS radio and set it up real quick, setting it to single channel and plain text, then punching in the freq. I took hold of the receiver and began to speak into it.

“Scepter to Nest, radio check over”

The feminine voice of my handler chimed in from the other end of the net.

“Hearing you, got some work for you”.

“Hit me”.

“Got a hit from the marines saying there’s some unusual activity in the mall on grover street, they want a specialist to look into it.”

I rolled my eyes and let out a sigh.

“Could they be more specific?” 

There was a short pause before nest finally responded.

“Some of the grunts said they heard coming from the old mall, not sure how its possible”.

“Yeah me neither, well I’ll start hoofing it there”

“Oh no need for that, there’s a convoy that you can hitch a ride with to the mall.”

I furrowed my brow 

“How did you manage that?”

I heard a soft chuckle from the other end.

“I have my ways, get geared, they're gonna pick you up soon”.

“I hear, scepter over and out”.

I said as I hung up the receiver and gathered up my gear. Of course it really wasn’t much, half of it was old surplus shit from vietnam or stuff I managed to get from camping stores that weren’t completely looted. I finished putting on my MOPP suit and clipped on my gas mask bag to my hip. I grabbed my alice and my weapon case and walked outside as I could hear the sound of diesel engines rumbling closer outside. 

I walked outside to see a six vehicle convoy of weathered humvees and five ton trucks driving down the snow covered street with a truck with a snow plow mounted on the front clearing the way. The line of vehicles came to a halt. A marine in full MOPP gear waved over to me from a canvas covered truck. I walked over as he leaned out the driver side window to get a better look at me.

“You the collector?” He asked the gas mask, muffling his voice.

I nodded and he thumbed behind him. 

“Hop in man, we’ll drop you off on the way”.   

I didn’t waste any time and quickly threw my things in the back of the covered five ton. I chambered into the shadowy interior. Half of the metal benches inside were occupied by the hunched over shapes of marines with combat loads, rifles slung over their chests. Arms crossed as some shivered in their MOPP gear. Some opted to not wear their gas masks as lit cigarettes hung from their lips. Stacks of framed alice packs filled the empty space from across the benches. I settled in my icey seat as a few of the marines offered grunts of acknowledgement. 

The truck let out a hiss before speeding off with delay. There was little sound besides the rumble of the engines as the scent of burning diesel and cigarette smoke hit my nostrils. I gazed out the back of the truck as the convoy passed half buried wreckages of cars and remains of what were once police checkpoints. 

The uncomfortable silence was finally broken as one of the younger marines turned to look at me. A question deep in his mind.

“I gotta ask, why do you collectors do this shit? Ain’t most of you civies?”

I snapped out of my own trance as I pivoted to him. I offered a shrug

“Most of us are, but we all got our reasons. Just like all of you I’m sure”.

“But we’re kind of forced to be here. You can just leave…right?” He asked naively and I quietly scoffed at this.

“You must be new around here, we can’t leave even if we wanted to”.

This seemed to deflate his desire to ask more questions as his shoulders slumped but he remained silent. The truck continued to rumble as it negotiated a large pothole that had no doubt only gotten bigger from the year or so of non-existent repairs.

The convoy stopped just shy of entering a semi crowded parking lot. Some cars were still left. Many of the windows had already been smashed, the tires slashed, or missing entirely. Even with the snow I could still see piles of scorched tires. Half frozen corpses still buckled into their seats. Some clutched their loved hands never letting go even after death, some clutched icey weapons that could never save them. All too common sight nowadays, a constant reminder for those like me. Doomed to join the frost.

A multistory behemoth of concrete and faded store logos jutted out over the horizon that was once a mall. its numerous frosted over windows hide its spiraling depths from my vision. I could feel the five ton slowing to a stop as it let out another hiss before falling motionless. Without a word I stood up from my seat and dropped my gear out of the truck before hopping out myself with a grunt. 

“Good luck collector” 

One of the marines bid me as I departed. I took a deep breath before reaching for my carrier bag on my hip for my gas mask. I quickly donned it and pulled over the chemical hood, zipping it tight. The marines only stared at me as their convoy sped away, leaving me to my own devices. I reached for the receiver that hung on the straps of my bag and quickly keyed in.

“Nest I’m on site, not seeing much yet. Looks pretty standard.”

“Standard as in…?”  she responded with a pause for me to elaborate.

“Not seeing any shells, still some bodies around. Atleast not any fresh ones. Gonna load up over.”

“Well you know the deal, try to take lots of pictures and get a live feed if you can”.

“Got it”. I said as I hung up my handset on the strap of my bag. I kneeled down and began to key in my code for the case. With a soft click it slotted open. I grabbed my thirty eight and my twelve gauge. I began to load it up with double ought buckshot. I chambered a shell into the chamber and quietly walked over to the smashed front door. 

The interior was dimly lit from the half covered sky light. I could still see the outlines of abandoned storefronts hanging in the empty interior. Trash and various articles of debris dotted the floor. I stooped under the half shattered as my boots crunched under shards of glass.

“Making entry” I quietly spoke into my handset as I stepped inside. 

A long hallway of looted storefronts and barred doors spiraled ahead of me.

“Copy get me a live feed scepter.” 

Next responded with a less carefree tone. I reached for the shoulder mounted. I switched it on and set it to record.

“Live feed up”. I replied as I slung my shotgun up.

“Patching in, standby”. She stated as my camera made a few whirring noises. I reached for my belt and grabbed a flashlight, quickly switching it on to illuminate the long hallway, finally I could hear static from my radio as nest finally chimed in. 

“Alrighty, patched in! You know what to do. I’ll keep watching the feed”.

“On it” I responded softly as I carefully walked past some of the shadowy storefronts. I shined my light in as I made my way past.

The fronts that weren’t barred were completely barren from looting. I could feel the bitter air still clutch me tightly in its frigid embrace. My mask lenses fogged up slightly as I breathed out warm air.

Despite how bright my light was. The darkness of the hallway seemed to swallow the beam itself. I continued forward as I passed flickering neon signs that illuminated the floating dust particles kicked up by my boots. 

I passed the hallway into the main atrium. The main skylight acted like a beacon of brightness in rest of the lightless mall. A maze of escalators and stairs twisted around the multistory atrium. It was almost beautiful in a way.. How calm and quiet everything was now. The crowds that strangled every inch of this place either fled like roaches into the rehabitation camps or became one of the wandering shells. Not it was just us and those who don’t belong here.

I was snapped out of my thoughts as I heard the distinct sound of a phone ringing. I looked over to see several worn pay phones lined up against the nearby balcony. The ringing reverberated the empty halls as I hesitated to answer it.

‘Scepter? What's wrong?”

Nest asked with a twinge of concern in her voice.

“Got uh…a audio irregularity here nest”

I said attempting to regain my radio etiquette. Despite my hesitation to answer it, it was still ringing. It should have stopped ringing by now.

“The phone?” She asked with a hint of hesitation.

“Yeah its still ringing”. I stated slightly unnerved by the constant ringing

“Go ahead and answer it. Don’t say anything unless its necessary. I’ll listen in”.

I sighed into the mic before replying to her

“Copy”

I approached the still ringing phone. I shines my flashlight on the box itself. It had a deep layer of dust covering its exterior. I noticed alot of the wiring were completely exposed with the insulation of the wiring almost completely stripped from the cables. Parts of it looked to be snapped off completely from being chewed on by rats.

“Nest, I don’t think the wiring is even intact enough for it to even work. This place part of the blackout zone?”

“I can see from here it's not. As for power, it's in blackout zone five last I checked. Could be a backup generator that's still running. Look into it after you answer it.”

“Got it”

I said as I picked up the receiver and put it to where my ears would be under the chemical hood. I heard slight static from the other side as I quietly listened for any sound I could pick up.

I could hear someone else listening on the other end just like I was. I considered saying something as the silence only began to sink in further but decided against it. Instead I slowly tapped the receiver a few times with my clunky chemical gloves. 

I knew whatever was on the other side heard it when what I can only describe as a sharp inhale, from something that had greater lung capacity than a human. I heard a voice straining itself like it was trying to speak for the first time. The line went back to muted static again. I kept listening for a few more moments and I could now hear what sounded like the usual kind of music you hear when you get put on hold.

Something about it was wrong at your first listen; it might sound like a normal song. Something you might hear in a mall or an elevator. Maybe some old department store. Unassuming, unremarkable.

The notes that played I quickly took note that some of them were out of tune, some didn’t even sound like they were played correctly. Like it was a song based on someone else’s memory alone.

I looked down at the receiver, staring at the weather worn phone. Still emitting that strange music. I hesitated to hang up yet. Especially since nest was still listening.

“Hang up.” Said nest with a more harsh edge to her voice.

I quietly set the phone back in its place, finally silencing it. I grabbed my handset for my radio. I held down the button to say something but any words I could say refused to leave my mouth. I let the button go as I released my gloved finger.

I started walking again, this time with my free hand on my holster. I suppressed the sound of my heavy winter boots as I best I could while also avoiding stepping on any shards of glass or loose paper. I could tell nest was watching the feed closely.

“Got a floorplan for this place?”

I asked her quietly

“Standby” she said with added professionalism.

I sighed softly and silently wished I was somewhere else. I took out one of my disposable cameras and snapped a few quick photos of my surroundings. Including that strange pay phone. Eventually I heard nest back on the net.

“From what I can there’s a series of maintenance tunnels that lead to some kind of…utility room? Seems large enough to house a generator.”

I softly tapped my rubberized boot for a moment in thought.

“If it was running all this time it should have been out of juice by now”.

Nest was silent for a few moments but I couldn’t tell her finger was on the receiver from the slight static through my hand mic.

“Look into it please, you should be able to get into maints through one of the storefronts.” She replied after a slight pause.

“Got it”. I replied as I shined my light into one of the storefronts.

I got a closer look through the amber beam of my flashlight. Most of the arcade cabinets were still inside. The colorful fonts and vibrant artwork sprawled across the peeling plastic stared indifferently at my form as I gazed inside. The way in was half covered by metal bars. I kneeled down to get a better look inside. Honestly it was in better shape than most of the storefronts in comparison. It seemed like the looters didn’t see much point in ransacking this place, that might not be a good sign.

I crouched in careful not to strike the barred food with any of my gear or my alice pack. The air inside still carried a deathly frigidity to it. Despite being sheltered from much of the wind’s wrath. Even with all of the insulated MOPP gear on, the cold didn’t relent.

I stood up and looked around my weathered surroundings, my footsteps softened on the faded starlike carpet. The beam from my light source reflected off the arcade machine’s screens. Some of them were cracked or had a thin layer of frost covering them. I passed the once colorful prize corner, its cheaply made winnings were still stocked, hardly even touched. As splotchy and worn they were. Not even the looters wanted that shit. I peered around the arcade looking for my way into the tunnels. I finally sighted a set of double industrial doors just past the two racing game machines. The pho double racing seats jutted out from the ultra wide screen of the machine. I passed by the barely legible titles of Dayton USA and Sega Rally as I got closer to the door.

I glanced up at the lightless exit sign that hung above the doorway. My hand grasped the handle and turned it quietly only to find it locked. I took a step back and sent a swift kick into the door. The rusted hinges didn’t offer much resistance as the door flew open to a door hallway. I peeked my head around the corner as the light illuminated clinical white walls, various piping and exposed cables jutted out from the walls. The hallway was silent with even the sound of howling wind not reaching this place.

I trudged forward not exactly eager to continue on, but I resigned myself to do so. Then finally somewhere deep within the darkness beside my vision, I could hear something stirring in the lightless corridor, music, just music. This time it was different from how I heard it on the phone. Loud and clear, no longer strangled by the static of the payphone’s receiver. 

The tone was melodic, probably an older song, with lots of classical instruments. It was soothing almost unnaturally so. Like a lullaby from your childhood, it almost sounded familiar to me. Like something that lingered in the back of my mind, despite how many years had passed. Where have I heard this before?

I switched off the flashlight and stowed it on my webbing. I groped for my dimmer headlamp and turned it on. I unslung the shotgun from over my shoulder and half pumped it to check for the shell’s presence in the chamber.

“Please be careful” I heard nest say with a hint of nervousness in her voice.

I looked down at my handset as she made this remark. She was right. I did need to be careful. I was alone, no one was there to watch my back. No one was there to patch me up or carry me out if I couldn’t make my own way out. If I went down no one was here to carry me to safety. Something could easily leap from the darkness and slit my throat before I even had the chance to fire off a single shell. If I had to run in this heavy gear would I even make it? Even if I dropped my pack. I would drop my only lifeline to the outside world with it. I tightened my grip on my shotgun to keep my hands from shaking.

I took a deep breath as the music echoed in some distant corner of the tunnel. I started carefully moving down the hallway. I held my shotgun close to me, the music only grew louder as I walked deeper into the shadows for what seemed like an eternity.

“Switching to open mic.” I said softly into my radio as I set it to hot mic my every word, I needed my hands free for what came next.  Nest didn’t reply this time.

The hallway finally led to an open doorway. Which proceeded a middling room that seemed to some kind of storage or utility room. Something made me stop dead in my tracks. Two dead bodies lay on the cracked concrete floor in newly made winter clothes. I raised my shotgun as I creeped past the threshold of the doorway. I quickly scanned the room for any kind of threats. I checked my corners. Double checked the doorway behind me to ensure I wasn’t followed here. I did everything by the book. I couldn’t find anything inside minus the bodies.

The utility room seemed to originally house some shelving and circuit breakers but now it seemed to be converted into some kind of makeshift sleeping area of sorts. Two winter sleeping bags were laid out as well as some various other amenities. A kerosene stove, a cooler, and some burnt out flashlights. The floor was covered in torn open bright yellow packaging from handed out HDRs, patriotically colored foil wrappers, stamped on cardboard food packets with half torn American flags and a small bold text that read:

‘food gift from the people of the united states of america.’

‘Nest got two bodies here, look to be vagrants. Gonna look them over.”

“Heard”

I kneeled down beside the first corpse. They were dressed in soaked winter clothes, scarves and all. They were laying face down. I grabbed their shoulders and turned them over. The pale lifeless face of a man in his mid thirties with his eyes wide open stared back at me. The warmth had been completely sapped from his body by the cold air, must have been dead for at least ten hours but it could have been longer. 

I started to cut open the clothes with a pair of trauma shears from my belt to see if I could get a better look at any wounds that could have killed him. I noted quickly I didn’t see any kind of wounds or massive trauma that could have did him in, hell I didn’t even see a single drop of blood on him. If I hadn’t known any better I would have said the cold took him.

The other corpse was in the same state. Ice cold, pale, no wounds, no blood, nothing. The clothes they were wearing should have protected them plenty from hypothermia or frostbite. Even if their clothes got wet. It was almost like they just gave up on living all together. 

I snapped a few pictures of the bodies and the room itself. Nest was still quiet.

“Nest these bodies-” She interrupted me.

“I know just take some samples and-”

Something finally dawned on me, the music had gotten much louder now. Nest had noticed it too. I stood up to stare at where the music was coming from. I waited for it to draw closer beyond the closed doors but it never did.

I slowly approached the door with my shotgun at the ready. I swung the door open only to see utter darkness staring back at me. I shined my headlamp into the darkness, the shadows seemed to swallow the beam from my light. This wasn’t any natural darkness. The music itself seemed to be coming from the shadows themselves, despite the pitch blackness, I could see what seemed to be particles of dust and snow swaying in the air within the symphony. Waves of heat vibrated in the air in that supernatural darkness.

I never thought I would ever get close to one of these. I felt gusts of hot and cold air brush past me. It was mesmerizing honestly, I felt myself go into a small trance, it seemed like I found the source of the strange activity.

“Nest got a positive ID on a musician here”.

“I can see that…what's it doing?”

She inquired as the peaceful music continued to play and echo in the halls. I observed it for a moment before finally replying.

“Its humming”. I replied as I lowered my shotgun.

“Did it kill those two?”

Nest asked me softly.

I looked back over at the two unmoving bodies then back at the musician, gazing at it for a second.

“Unlikely, I don’t see any burns on them.”

As I said this I could hear something different. The fluorescent overhead light tubes began to softly buzz above me. I was sure the power was completely dead besides that phone. My doubts began to fester as they began to flicker on and off.

I felt a pit forming in my stomach as the lights continued to act up. Even the burnt out flashlights nearby began to flicker to life. Nothing about this was right, nothing about this made any sense. I needed to leave and fast.

“N-nest permission to-”

I stopped myself mid sentence. There was another sound. I waited, I listened. I heard it, somewhere close by but I couldn’t tell where. The sound of scrapping metal began to draw near. It almost sounded like it was coming from all around, every angle, every corner. I prepared myself for the task ahead, fighting for my survival. I kept turning and turning trying to point the barrel of my weapon at the source of this sound. 

“Scepter? What's wrong? What do you hear?” She asked with dread seeping into her usually calming voice. I debated telling her that I was cutting the job short and ditching it, but it was probably too late now. 

“Hold traffic”. I said as I curled my finger around the trigger, I waited for anything to move to make itself a target. But it only got quieter, even the musician’s ever present melody fell silent. The only sound I could hear now was the buzzing from the lights above me.

I continued to look around my surroundings. My heart started to beat faster like it was about to burst out of my chest at any moment. I felt sweat begin to build up under my stuffy MOPP suit.

I froze in place, there was only one place I hadn’t checked. Right above me. The musician suddenly blared out a series of notes much louder than before. The walls seemed to vibrate from the volume, it was much different from the song it was humming a few moments ago.

This song was fast paced, suspenseful like something you might hear in a good horror movie. I realized something at that moment, it was warning me. I didn’t have a chance to wonder why as I looked up

What I saw hanging from the ceiling was something I could hardly put into words. Where would I even start with describing what I saw?

My eyes burned when I looked at it, tears began to overtake my vision. The lenses on my gas mask began to fog up.

I could hear my radio crackling with some kind of interference. My trigger felt like it weighed fifty pounds. It was reaching out to me but I quickly noticed it didn’t have any hands. What I remember the most was its misshapen smile or maybe it was a sneer. I couldn’t tell. I finally squeezed the trigger.

I was quickly glad I chose buckshot this time otherwise I probably would have missed. I slam fired two shells into it. I know I hit it but it didn’t stop it. I was confident that it took off an arm if you could call it that. But it did give me just enough time to bolt for the door.

“Class five! Class five!” I yelled into the radio as my hand grasped the doorknob. I swung the door open and slammed it shut behind me

My heavy boots stomped loudly as I took off in a dead sprint down the never ending hallway. I could hardly see where I was going out of the foggy lenses.

“Get the fuck out of there locke!”

I could hear nest scream through the crackling interference of my radio.

That's when I heard those god awful sounds coming from behind me. The door behind bulged as it slammed into it with its endless body. The door began to bend and twist as its writhing appendages reached through the jagged gaps in the door. The sounds it made, like nothing I had ever heard in all my years of being a collector. A deep rumbling murmur shook my surroundings. The sound traveled through my body as this hum only increased in volume. The lights flicked rapidly as they were reanimated. My breathing only increased in rhythm as I reached the double doors back to the arcade. I could hear the sound of the door behind finally giving away as it flew off its hinges and slammed into the ground.

I shoulder checked the next door open, quickly shutting it behind me, thats when I noticed the arcade began to flicker alight. It wasn’t just the lights this time, it was the arcade machines too.

The dusty screens and debris-ridden speakers began to reanimate. Light filled the forgotten arcade, slow and sputtering at first, like something waking up that shouldn’t. Colored bulbs cracked to life one by one, blinking and stuttering like fireflies drowning in static. The machines, long-dead and dust-caked, flickered to their attract modes. Glitched gameplay previews stuttered across the screens, voices warbled through shredded speakers.

One cabinet, deep in the row behind me, let out a warped shriek.

“DAY… TONAAAAA—AA!”

It was blown out, distorted, far too loud for such a hollow space. The sound hit my chest like a shockwave—cheerful, enthusiastic, completely wrong. It echoed through the arcade like something remembering how to be alive, even if it didn’t understand why.

Even through the flashing lights and mechanical noise, I heard it: the door creaking open. The one I knew I had locked.

It slithered. It crawled. It walked—all at once, but never made a sound when it moved. I ducked low behind a row of jammed cabinets, trying not to breathe too loud. My gear felt like dead weight now.

I tried to keep my breathing as quiet as possible even with the adrenaline pumping into my veins. I was hardly able to stand up with how much my legs were shaking.

Even though it didn’t make a sound when it moved. I could still hear a very muffled creak from the floor itself from its mass. It whirred and warbled; it almost sounded like it was mechanical in nature instead of coming from a living thing.

The doorway was close but not close enough for me to make a mad dash for it without it catching up to me before I could crawl back under the barred door.

I slowly reached on my belt for something I had been saving for a rainy day just like this, an incendiary grenade. It felt like it took a lifetime for me to unhook it from my webbing without alerting it to my presence. 

I let my shotgun hang from the sling across my chest as I took off the various safety pins on the grenade. I slowly peeked through a gap between two machines. I could see its massive form almost covering the entire gap. I slowly pied the corner with my finger on the pin of the grenade, ready to pull at any time. I peeked my head around the corner. It wasn’t facing me this time. It was completely still, listening for the smallest sounds.

I twisted and pulled the pin with considerable force. I knew it heard it because it stopped making those god awful sounds. My arms felt heavy as lead. I fought my shaking hands to keep my thumb on the clip to keep it from going off in my hand.

It turned to look at me with that smile that was too wide, too misshapen. That's when I realized, it wasn’t smiling. It just didn’t have any lips for its spiraling maw. Its many eyes stared right into me.

Every single cell of my body screamed at me to run, to hide. I grit my teeth and finally tossed the grenade.

I didn’t know if the live feed was still active, I hoped it was but I know this must have been hard for her to watch but at least she had the common sense to stay quiet while this thing was after me. I felt tempted to turn off the live feed so she didn’t have to watch me get ripped apart by this thing. What little chances I had, lay in that cylinder of thermite. 

The grenade landed right next to it. It glanced over at it with its many independently blinking eyes. That's when it finally went off, first thing I saw was the smoke then the grenade hissing harshly as it released a cone of sparks. The mold covered carpet was the first thing to catch aflame.

I expected to hear it screeching, screaming. Anything but it was silent. Normally alot of these things scream when fire touches them. They hate it more than anything else.

I took my chance and dashed for the doorway as the smoke began to fill the room. I reached the barred door and practically threw my body through the gap. I slammed it shut and made sure it couldn’t be opened this time. My breathing was ragged as I laid on the floor covered in sweat. Smoke had finally claimed the majority of the room, obscuring my view of its interior.

I was about to push myself back up and continue running but something stopped me. An orange glow could be seen through the thick smoke. That's when I saw it, it was still alive. It emerged from the smoke. Its entire form engulfed in flames. That's when I realized how tall it really was. It stooped down to gaze at me. The flames didn’t seem to bother it as its flesh began to char.

I aimed my shotgun at it with my unsteady hands as it continued to stare at me from its side of the barred door. Its lipless maw began to move like it was trying to speak. I was glued to the spot as I could only stare at it with wide eyes as they stinged from looking at it.

Its appendages wrapped themselves around the bar, still staring down at me. I felt thoughts that weren’t my own enter my mind. A single word kept repeating itself over and over again from a voice I never heard in my life.

“Reanimator” It continued to echo in the confines of my skull.

Finally my radio screamed to life once again and I heard nest’s calming voice over the net. She only said one word.

“Run”

This seemed to snap me out of my trance. I pushed myself to my feet and took off down the hallway. The lights around me were flashing wildly as my legs burned from all the gear I was running with. I rounded the corner, entering the main atrium again.

I came to a screeching halt at what I saw next. Everything was back to normal, all the decay, all the disrepair. It was gone. The lights were back, the biting cold air had vanished entirely. The mall wasn’t just repaired, it was alive again. There were people. There were families and groups of teenagers meeting up at the food court after school. All walking by at a leisurely pace for a slow afternoon of shopping, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.

The people looked normal enough at first. Nirvana shirts, jeans, the newest kicks. All wearing bright summer wear but I couldn’t see any of their faces. They weren’t missing them entirely, they were fuzzy like trying to take a picture of someone’s face when the camera was out of focus.

They didn’t even seem to notice I was there. Some of them even walked right through me like I was a hologram. I was lost, lost in more ways than I could possibly imagine. I reached for my radio in vain hope that I could still reach nest.

“Nest…can you hear me?”

I desperately wished to hear nest’s nonchalant voice over the net. I could only hear static from the other end, I was truly alone in this mall of ghosts.

The various shop fronts were stocked again. The windows were pristine and undamaged. I could see the out of focus people lazily walking back and forth between the aisles like it was just another day for them. Some of them occupied the colorful seating of the food court and gestured to each other like they were having casual conversations, but the only sounds I could hear from the were indistinct mumblings and murmurs of echoes of human voices. 

Sometimes I missed those days, I missed feeling safe. I missed coming back home to her smiling face. I missed the simple monotony of a nine to five. Hell I even missed those annoying ass jingles they played for ads on daytime TV. I missed it all. I began to wonder if this is where I would spend the rest of my days, wandering in this endless mall. Unseen, unnoticed. Bound to this mockery of normal life.

I trapsed forward not sure where to go at this point besides the exit I came from. I passed the now pristine pay phones. One of them began to ring suddenly. I immediately stopped where I was. 

I sighed softly and slowly walked towards the still ringing phone. That's when I felt a warm hand grasping my shoulder. I turned sharply, bringing my shotgun to bear. Staring back at me was a young woman in her mid twenties. Her face was different from the others, her face was in focus, she had delicate features. Jet black hair with long bangs. She had unnaturally pale eyes.

“You shouldn’t answer that”.

She said in a soft yet firm tone. I ripped free from her gip and backed away from her still aiming my shotgun at her.

“Why not?” I asked in a flat tone.

“You don’t want to know what it will tell you”.

I lowered my shotgun slightly

“It?” I asked not liking where this was going.

“The reanimator”

I was silent for a moment debating on what I should even do at this point.

“Who are you?” I asked warily

She crossed her arms and tilted her head slightly as she regarded me.

“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you”

I opened my mouth to ask her another question but she cut me off.

“No more questions Locke, you need to leave this place.”

“How?” I asked with hesitation, unnerved she knew my name. I know she probably wouldn’t tell me how she knew.

“Same way you came in. you don’t have much time. It's coming. You want to see Lorraine again don’t you?”

My eyes widened as I was stunned into silence. I finally mustered up some words to respond to her. 

“Y..yes”

“Then go” She said with a wave of her hand.

The last thing I saw her do was wink at me before she turned and walked a few steps away from me and her form faded entirely from my vision. 

Then I heard that horrifying yet familiar humming, it was close. I knew I couldn’t hide from it. Fighting it was a losing battle. All I could do was run and pray for my survival. That's exactly what I did at that moment. I ran like I never ran before in my entire life.

The humming was getting closer even as I increased my speed. I finally saw my way out, the doors I took to get inside the mall, now a pristine set of sliding glass doors.

Outside I could see a familiar sight. Snow covered streets, the wreckages of cars, the frozen corpses. I slammed the doors open as I barreled myself outside using the last vestiges of my energy and will to live.

I panted as I continued sprinting into the knee deep snow not caring about the gear getting covered in snow. My radio began to squawk at me as I heard nest’s worried voice over comms.

“Scepter! Scepter come in!”

“I’m here!” I could hear nest sigh in relief from the other end.

“Thank fuck! Your feed cut and I couldn’t reach you.”

I took a deep breath in and out.

“I’m okay…I’m- sorry” I said in between breaths

“No shut up, just…get back safe”

I turned look back at the mall once again, it was in disrepair, ruined, worn down. The neon sign above the doorway that read ‘grover mall’ began to flicker. I cursed under my breath and raised my shotgun to my shoulder.

I saw its body coil itself by the doorway. Its infinite eyes stared back at me as I backed away from the mall. It observed me for a second before it suddenly recessed its measureless form back within the confines of the mall. I don’t know why it didn’t come after me. Nest made one last transmission for awhile

“Okay…the money will be in a dead drop. Pick up is ten minutes away. Nest out.”

I sighed and turned away from that awful place and walked down the treacherous road to await pick up. I always tried to avoid that place when taking contracts. I wish I could say I never did collector work again but I was in no place to quit. I went back to that church. Smoked a couple cigs, stared into the embers of the pastor’s fire and went out to do it all over again, the next day but I never went back to blackout zone five.",1,1770009689.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1qtm4ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1qtm4ou/9_signs_someones_hiding_their_feelings_for_you/,9 Signs Someone's Hiding Their Feelings for You: The Psychology Behind Attraction,"
Spent way too much time analyzing crushes, exes, and ""situationships"" last year. Started noticing patterns everywhere. People at work. Friends. Myself. We're all terrible at hiding feelings apparently.

Pulled insights from psychology research, attachment theory books, and way too many relationship podcasts. Turns out the science behind hidden attraction is fascinating and makes so much sense once you understand it.

Here's what actually signals someone's into you but won't say it:

**The lingering stare thing**

They look at you longer than necessary. Not creepy long, just slightly too long. When you catch them they look away fast. Psychologist Dr. Arthur Aron found prolonged eye contact increases attraction and creates intimacy even between strangers. His research showed mutual gaze triggers dopamine release in the brain, the same chemical associated with falling in love. Your nervous system literally can't help responding to someone you're attracted to.

**""Accidental"" physical proximity**

They always end up near you. At group hangouts, they gravitate to your side. Find excuses to be in your space. Dr. Monica Moore at Webster University studied nonverbal courtship behaviors and found proximity seeking is one of the top indicators of attraction. We unconsciously reduce physical distance with people we're drawn to.

**The mirroring effect**

They copy your body language without realizing it. You lean in, they lean in. You cross your arms, suddenly theirs are crossed too. This is called the chameleon effect and research published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology shows we mirror people we like or want to connect with. It's subconscious rapport building.

**Nervous energy around you**

They act slightly different when you're around. More fidgety. Talk faster. Laugh louder at things that aren't that funny. Dr. Lisa Firestone, clinical psychologist and author of ""Conquer Your Critical Inner Voice"", explains this happens because attraction activates our sympathetic nervous system, the fight or flight response. Adrenaline surges. Heart rate increases. Same biology that makes your hands shake before a presentation.

If you want to understand attachment patterns better (like why some people hide feelings while others overshare), ""Attached"" by Dr. Amir Levine and Rachel Heller changed how I see relationships entirely. The book breaks down anxious, avoidant, and secure attachment styles based on decades of psychological research. It's not self help fluff, it's actual science about why we behave the way we do in relationships. Made me realize I was dating my attachment wounds on repeat.

**Jealousy reactions**

They get weird when you mention other people you're interested in or dating. Mood shifts. Change the subject. Get quieter. Psychologist Dr. Helen Fisher studies romantic love using brain scans and found jealousy activates the same brain regions as physical pain. When someone's into you, hearing about your interest in others genuinely hurts.

**They remember everything**

Obscure details from conversations weeks ago. Your coffee order. That random story about your childhood pet. When someone's attracted to you, their brain prioritizes information about you. The reticular activating system in your brain filters what's important, and crush material becomes very important.

**Finding excuses to text**

They send you memes. Random questions. ""This reminded me of you"" messages. Communication stays open even when there's no real reason to talk. This is bid for connection behavior, a concept from relationship researcher Dr. John Gottman's work. They're testing if you'll respond, maintaining the connection thread.

For understanding the psychology behind why people hide feelings, ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Dr. Bessel van der Kolk isn't specifically about romance but it explains how past experiences and trauma shape our ability to be vulnerable. The book won awards for good reason. It's dense but incredibly insightful about why some people shut down emotionally even when they care deeply.

There's also BeFreed, an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni that pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. Worth checking if you're trying to decode attraction patterns or understand attachment styles better. It generates custom learning plans based on specific goals, like ""understand why people hide feelings"" or ""improve at reading romantic signals."" The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Helped connect a lot of dots between the books and research mentioned here.

**They're suddenly interested in your interests**

Started watching that show you mentioned. Reading books in your favorite genre. Asking about your hobbies. This is strategic self expansion from Dr. Arthur Aron's research on relationships. We adopt interests of people we're attracted to as a way to build connection and shared identity.

The whole ""hidden feelings"" thing usually comes down to fear. Fear of rejection. Fear of ruining the friendship. Fear of vulnerability. Attachment theory explains this perfectly. If someone has an avoidant attachment style (about 25% of people), they'll feel attraction but their nervous system screams DANGER when intimacy gets real. Not because they don't care. Because their brain learned early that closeness equals pain.

Most people aren't playing games or being manipulative. They're just scared. The signs are there if you know what to look for, but they're subtle because the person is actively trying to hide them while simultaneously unable to fully hide them. Biology vs willpower. Biology usually wins.

The tricky part is what you do with this information. Sometimes the healthiest move is walking away from someone who can't be direct about their feelings. Sometimes it's worth having the scary conversation. Depends on the situation and what you can handle.",1,1770009269.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

I'm very new to woodworking, but I really want to build my own bed frame. My only experience is that I built my coffee table, but it was a very basic build. 

  
I'm obsessed with [this bed frame, ](https://karupdesign.com/en-us/products/ziggy-bed-clear-lacquered-queen-size)but think it would be way more fun and challenging to try to build it myself! Or as close to it as I can? I would want the shelves on all 3 sides of the bed, as opposed to 2. Don't necessarily need the little cutouts by the head of the bed. 

  
The only problem is that I have no idea where to start on a material list. The website has dimensions which are kind of helpful....I think? haha

I have a queen-sized mattress. And can probably just reuse the slats from my current bed frame on the inner box.

We are a really happy family, everything seems fine, spending days together whole, having an amazing s-life. I could say our life is perfect.

I'm from a very religious family.. I met her when she was a messed, she was my classmate during college, she had a romantic relationship with her own cousin, she work in a bar, going out with her clients, 3 nights in one cases. So she's like a Pros**tute if someone will describe her. But despite all that, i accepted her.

Until one day, 3 months ago, my ex-wife says she's not happy, she doesn't feel any romantic feelings for me anymore. She decided to broke up with me, we live separately, but since i love her so much, i will try everything to win her back.

Everyday, i still drive and fetch her at work, we are okay, we talk casually, we always have dinner, coffee date, spent time with our kids. Having great s*x, everything feels normal, feels like we are still together but don't have label or commitment yet.

I never think that she will look for another attention, until one day, out of curiosity, i checked the cctv at her home, not to check her but to check our kids. There, i saw her videocalling someone, she seems happy talking to that guy. I did not confronted her immediately. I look for a right now and it's the day after tomorrow.

We are alone, i asked her if she is talking to someone already. Cuz i told her before, i want her to be honest with me, tell me if she's already talking to someone so i won't look like an idiot. She look straight into my eyes and said ""No, i'm not talking to someone"" My life feels falling apart because i knew.. And she lied n my face. I told her what i saw and that i knew she was talking to someone. She stay silent.
She said it's just talking and doesn't intent to meet him and take it to the next level.

But i feel betrayed, my emotions are high, i'm not thinking straight.. I grabbed her phone, asking who this guy is, and she's defending him.
I took a screw driver, threatened to destroy her phone if she doesn't say who that guy is and she still refuse. So i broke her phone, i was really mad.. And she saw my face how mad i am. Just mad.. Because we been together for 12 years and it's not even 3 months, she already looking for someone.

Next day, she went somewhere alone for 2 days to breathe some air. And when she came back, she don't want to see me anymore and says we both should move on. I know i fcked up, so i just listened and didn't argue. 
She said she got traumatized because of what happened, thinking or hearing my name makes her scared. I admit i overreact.. But 12 years of protecting her was gone in her mind just because of one incident.

I don't know where to start from here..
It happened yesterday and now it's our first day not seeing each other.
I know you guys going to tell me that she's my ex already and shouldn't expect much from it.
But it's not how i feel during our separation time.

She's my first love.. She's the love of my life.. I did everything for our family. And now i'm all alone.
I need some advice where to start..

In case it’s relevant, I am using a dreamware nasal cushion mask. I did a titration study and found that to be the best mask for me. I also use a chin strap at the behest of the doctor even though I do not believe I am breathing through my mouth - I think rather what is happening (and I have been able to replicate this since having my machine at home) is that I have a very high narrow pallet and my tongue does not sit against it unless I consciously make that happen. When it comes away from the roof of my mouth, my mouth fills with air. This happens no matter how tight I make the chin strap. Due to this I end up swallowing a lot of air. I cannot use a full face mask due to trauma issues. 

Since night 2 I’ve had “perfect” nights pretty much every night - nothing below a 98. Always a 20/20 on the seal. My AHI has never been over 0.4 (it was 37 in my sleep study) Objectively, I am getting much better sleep. Instead of my sleeping O2 hovering between 87-95, it’s now 94-100. My heart rate is dropping more when I am sleeping and my hrv is much higher. I am getting up less to pee at night. I am sleeping comfortably on my back without needing to roll over for pain for at least 6 hours at a stretch. I am spending much more time in deep sleep according to my Apple Watch. And I am SO MUCH MORE exhausted than I was before starting the therapy. Like I wasn’t tired at all before the machine and now I want to sleep all the time, I take by and for my adhd and not even that can get me moving in the morning. I had quit coffee and today I had a quad shot of espresso and still had to come home and take a nap. I know sometimes people get more tired when starting therapy but I feel like it’s usually due to sleeping poorly or having difficulty adjusting to the cpap and I really haven’t had any issues. But I was pretty much fine before this - they only did my sleep study to rule out apnea as a comorbidity because they thought I needed a surgery I ended up not needing. I barely snore, but apparently I still dropped down to less than 88% O2 briefly during my study and while I had almost no obstructive apneas I obviously had a really high number of hypopnea’s. Most people I have read that had apnea as severe as mine seem to feel so much better after their first good night of sleep with their machine but after nearly a month I still hate it just because it’s making me so tired. Is this normal? If you had this, how long did it take to go away? Should I be looking at the OSCAR data or is it not going to tell me anything useful if I have 0 AHI most of the time and it says no mask leaks?",4,1770009129.0,CPAP,3,1.0,False

The sun kept going around the world, as expected.

Traffic lights cycled properly. Trains departed with certain delay. Satellites reported good atmospheric readings, from every monitored hemisphere.

A Good morning. A Good night

This surely would be a good day … or was it?

Of course it was.

Heroes started their patrols in some parts of the world, as it all went just as well as it could be.

Hospitals updated overnight intake numbers. Factories kept going smoothly, power grids  adjusted for peak demand as always. International airspace was clear, with no deviations beyond expected civilian variance.

In the suburbs of east Asia, doors opened. machines hummed.

Children tied their shoes while parents checked their phones for news they expected.

It was true that in almost every place, screens flickered to life. Morning anchors smiled the way they always did—measured, confident, practiced. The world was awake, and it was all to be expected

Nothing unusual to report, especially in Japan.

After all, the crime rate was just under 6%, something most countries tended to envy.

''There is no solar activity of concern. Space agencies confirm routine monitoring continues normally.'' The dark skinned woman said, professionally as always.

''and now next, my-'' The lights at the studio flickered, the broadcast seemed to have been interrupted for a minute.

And as soon as it was back...

''Uhm..'' The woman tapped her intercom device

''Seems we had some technical difficulties, but now it's all solved''

''Even if the cause is unknown...'' She muttered but quickly composed.

She was late.

Not late in a catastrophic way, just enough to be annoyed about it.

The light at the crosswalk seemed to stay red longer than usual. She could hear someone nearby who sighed like the day had personally offended them.

A hero came running from across a corner, quickly.

She could tell it was a hero because of the weird  scarf and goggles.

Everyone was used to it.

She didn't even pay attention as the guy fought a pair of petty thieves.

She glanced in that direction, only to see the thieves already kneeling, hands behind their heads, grumbling about unfairness and  their bruises.

The hero was waving nonchalantly at a kid filming him on his phone as the hero wrote up the report of the incident.

For her, it was business as usual.

She just kept walking.

She was kinda glad she could enjoy small things like this, just a bit of calm, in contrast with her job, that was—kinda tedious.

She saw as a guy that spilled coffee onto the sidewalk from a when he bumped into a girl.

“Sorry.” The brunette girl said while fidgeting her hands.

“No problem.” The blonde boy calmly answered, waving it off.

“Have a good day.” She saw that girl composing herself.

She kept walking

She heard the people that laughed. The chatter was a melodic mess of sounds.

A guy was stuck in traffic, he honked twice from a delivery truck, impatient but polite.

The city... it all seeemed to work just fine, maybe because everyone agreed it did…

There wasn't much she could do or achieve, anyway...

She looked at the sky when stopping at another crosswalk, maybe searching to ponder about something.

It uh, wh-

she looked  just for a second...then quickly looked back.

Pink didn't seem to be the correct way to describe it.

It was too soft?

Like light filtered through... the air. But not quite.

There was no clouds. No smoke. No obvious source.

Just… color.

She kept staring.

A woman that was nearby, looked at it curiously.

“Is that some kind of ad?”

Just an after effect of a battle?. An Atmospheric effect... Light pollution?.

The explanations came easily.

She couldn't get her sight off it.

“She couldn’t take her eyes off it. Living in Musutafu, she was used to chaos—but this felt different.”

Everyone just was giving their explanations around her, she wasn't listening at all...

She shook her head as the lights turned to green, already walking forward.

============================================================================================================================================

The room was too cold for how many people worked in it.

Rows of monitors glowed softly, most of them unchanged for hours. Telemetry feeds scrolled in steady lines.

The numbers displayed were almost always the same. They had the kind of shift where time stretched and nothing mattered enough to remember.

He was eating a stale protein bar, halfway through it.

He had been thinking, not for the first time, that this wasn’t what the brochures had promised.

Space defense sounded impressive when people asked. Monitoring orbital assets. Planetary safety. Long-range detection. It suggested urgency, purpose.

something that mattered in the immediate sense.

 In practice, it meant watching numbers sit still for hours and signing off on reports that said exactly what yesterday’s had.

The data was always stable. Within expected parameters.

He’d been promoted, technically. A desk closer to the central displays. A slightly better chair. The authority to approve reboots without filing a ticket. It came with responsibility, sure—but not the kind that felt real. Not yet.

He told himself that was fine.

Someone had to watch the quiet hours. Someone had to sit between the interesting parts and make sure nothing happened in the meantime. Most of the work was trusting that the people who built the machines knew what they were doing, and that space, for the most part, behaved.

He liked that about it. The predictability. The idea that if something did go wrong, it would be obvious. Alarms. Red lights. Protocols kicking in like they always said they would.

Until then, his job was to wait.

Approve routine checks. Glance at feeds he already knew were clean. Count the minutes until the shift ended.

When his subordinate called his name, casual and unbothered, John assumed it would be more of the same.

Something small. Something fixable.

 when one of the indicators blinked.

Once.

Then again.

His companion that was next to him frowned, leaning closer into his own smaller screen.

“Hey, John,” The guy that john liked to call Mike asked for his attention, not bothering to raise his voice.

“Satellite twenty, sector A of the south—west side—looks like it just… got fried.”

John didn’t turn around immediately. He was standing a few desks away, arms crossed, eyes on a different set of displays.

“Fried how?” he asked.

“Weak Signal. Hard drop. An instant degradation.” Mike tapped a few keys. “And—uh—another one. Sector F, north-east. It’s not operating at all. I can’t even localize it.”

That got John to move.

A couple of footsteps. A chair scraping lightly against the floor.

“Could be a relay hiccup,” John said, leaning over his shoulder. “Run diagnostics.”

“I am.” He paused, fingers hovering over the keyboard. The numbers on the screen didn’t finish loading. They didn’t stabilize. They just… weren’t right.

“John” he said slowly.

“What.”

“I’m not receiving anything normal.”

John straightened a little.

He pulled up another panel, then another. His brow furrowed as more alerts populated the screen—not red, not critical, just persistent. Wrong in a quiet way.

“The Geiger counters” he continued, swallowing. “All satellites that are orbiting right now in the west. They’re beeping. Not spiking.

just—beeping. Across the board.”

John stared at the data.

“That doesn’t make sense, there is no enough radiation, no solar flares today for anything nearing that scale” he said.

“I know.” Mike exhaled through his nose, forcing a small, nervous breath. “The system might be busted. Help me restart this—maybe the calibration’s off.”

John hesitated.

Just for a  few seconds too long.

“Yeah” he said finally. “Okay. Let’s reboot all arrays in the west. One step at a time.”

The screens kept glowing.

''Put it in my screen Mike, this is odd'' John said as he saw Mike show the program into the bigger screen.

The monitor blinked. Feeds reinitialized. the system did many checks as it started displaying everything again.

Nothing changed.

“Okay,” John said quietly. “That’s… not ideal.”

The restart of the system didn't fix the issue, something indeed VERY wrong

The beep that indicated the presence of the radiation kept softly going, without any spikes.

The younger scientist, Mike,  dragged a window across his screen, layering orbital paths over the anomaly zone. At first, it was just noise.

Dozens of small signatures scattered unevenly around the planet.

Then the system finished aligning the data.

“John” he said again. This time, his voice didn’t try to sound casual.

John leaned in.

The dots shifted as the software corrected for parallax, the image settling into a clearer view. What had been scattered resolved into structure.

Lines emerged, apparently, the object was connected together by more of the same material. Five long arcs curved inward, meeting at invisible points.

A star.

Not perfect. Not mathematical. But unmistakable.

It had five peeks.

The satellites around. Their signatures kept going, faint but persistent, it wasn't something thing the sensors could name.

“That’s not debris,” John said.

“I see it” Mike replied. “It's completely pink, it shouldn't”

''Mike... just call Richard Hale'' John said while looking at more dots appearing in the screen.

The formation looked like a scattered asteroid shower.

Too many small objects, too irregular to be natural.

It was like a cluster.

The objects were made of a multi-colored material, crystalline in nature, it seemed.

Much like the bigger ones that were pink, these objects resembled a shape, an sphere in this case, but the sphere had many very small gaps.

''You mean the Global Defense Director-'' Mike answered to John

''Just go get him, when the objects get into atmosphere, we will have no more than 6 minutes to do something.'' John said, coldly, he grabbed a nearby phone–calling someone, he was tracking coordinates of the objects while at it.

Mike departed without saying another word.

==========================================================================================================================================

Her phone buzzed once in her hand, then stopped.

She frowned at the screen as she walked,  hovering where the signal bars should have been. Nothing loaded. No messages refreshed. She slowed, tapping the screen once, then again, before shoving the phone back into her pocket with a quiet huff.

Why was she even bothering to check? She was gonna be late if she didn't hurry.

She decided to walk fast.

But  the light from a nearby electronics store caught her eye.

Every television in the display window was on.

Not playing ads.

But the news.

She stopped without realizing it, joining two other pedestrians who had done the same.

Inside, the screens showed the same image from slightly different angles—blue graphics.

A familiar logo in the corner, a newsroom desk that looked a little too stiff  just like the presenter, it was a little too alert for a normal broadcast.

“we’re receiving multiple reports of unusual atmospheric visuals” the anchor was saying, her smile thinner than before. “Authorities emphasize there is no cause for alarm at this time.”

Behind the woman, a wide shot of the sky played on loop. Pale pink light stretched faintly across the frame, not much visible unless you knew where to look. It was a brightened horizon.

The girl tilted her head, it looked like the light she had seen before.

Her phone vibrated again. This time, a notification loaded, nothing important.

She looked back up at the screens.

''According to our experts, this unidentified light has been caused by unknown celestial objects near our atmosphere'' The anchor explained gently.

''The objects are nearing atmosphere entry. Updates will follow as more information becomes available.'' The woman smiled softly at the camera. though it wasn't as controlled as usual; her eyebrows tilted instead of rising.

The transmission then cut into holding screen.

She could read what was there 'Standby, we are gathering information, this should take a minute or two'

She glanced at her watch, she didn't had more time to lose.

It was still enough time to make it if she hurried.

She took two steps away from the storefront.

The static of the TV caught her attention, the white noise cut through her thoughts.

She slowed. Then stopped, to think…

''Nearing atmosphere entry'' She could remember the anchor say.

That meant close.

Closer than satellites were supposed to be.

She’d heard emergency reassurances before

They never used that phrasing unless something was already gone wrong.

Just in case, She would stay.

She stared at the TV, there was some people gathered around the storefront like her.

No one dared to talk.

They just waited.

She then decided to look back at the sky, by coincidence.

She saw the same pink light as before.

But now it looked, brighter.

The sound of the new's theme startled her, he looked back to the TVs.

The anchor was again preparing herself to speak. The news ticker now displayed something.

'BREAKING NEWS: Unidentified objects detected in upper atmosphere. Authorities tracking trajectory.'

''Back to the main situation, we have been informed that the unknown objects have entered atmosphere'' The woman said, almost rushing, like he was on a very strict schdule.

''Their trajectory is being tracked right now, evacuation may follow, as every media in Europe has already made clear that pieces of the main pink object are separating''

''They have already evacuate every site where these smaller objects will impact.'' The anchor kept explaining.

''The space agencies would have tried comitting to the normal protocol, but according to them, it all seemed to have came out of nowhere, and the objects seem to be somehow going at a extreme vertical velocity despite their size''

The woman explained as images of where the main objects were right now were being displayed.

It looked like it was afternoon there, the objects illuminated the sky, one resembled a star, it was all pink, just like that light...

There was also a mess of dots, they looked multicolored, getting apart from each other as they traveled, they quickly scattered around.

Both object's had smaller pieces constantly separated.

They were very far.

''So it's confirmed, tHe last resort global defense protocol is to be followed, the objects will disminish in size as we attack them''

In the video, what looked like many beams, bright white, hitted the objects, the beams came from different places, presumably from satellites.

ZNNNNT… ZNNNNT… ZNNNNT

''The intend was to change the object's trajectory to the ocean'' The pink object in the distance just kept going, the beams seemed to be refracted from its surface, at most it caused some more pieces of it to separate.

The smaller ones changed tracjectory, but the integrity of whatever it was made, didn't seem exactly...affected.

While the beams that attacked the multicolored objects seemed to do something, the problem is that they thing wasn't losing momentum.

All it made was make smaller pieces of it , wich made them have many different trajectories, some inmediatelly fell in picade

''But as resistant as the objects are, they can't be neutralized, they Will go past us and orbit the earth once more and end up falling somewhere around Asia, Our sources say it's going to be in the east''

Many videos, she saw the media, of course this couldn't be just some rumor, it wasn't an assumption from some dumb organization, atleast that was certain,

''Every goverment has now followed the corresponding procedure after trying to attack the objects''

  '' A system of peak technology nets to soften the impact will be inmediately instaled in the next cities and it's sorrounding areas''

''Tokyo, Nihobashi, Jaku, Hosu, Yokohama, Musutafu...''

She heard the anchor list a lot of cities...

Every single person watching the news seemed to panic in silence, just like herself...

''You must listen to your local authorities to be secured to the nearest shelter if you are in a high-risk zone of these cities"" The anchor kept going, fast talking.

""It's being notable in some countries, that , electromagnetic signals aren't behaving normally since the objects in the sky are messing with them in some way, specially with the one commonly used for internet, so expect some failures""  The woman tried to say calmly.

""Please, remain calm, the authorities are handling this"" The TV cut back to the holding screen

This time it just displayed a map.

Many maps

They were from different cities, some parts of the maps were blurred in red, it just indicated that red zones in it were in: Danger

She glanced at the musutafu map on the TV again. Red zones blurred a lot of the city, warning of imminent impact.

There was two bigger zones, one of them was the main commercial district.

Her office building, it was right in the middle.

Well. At least she probably wouldn’t have to work today.

Where are my son's things? I asked. My sister laughed.","When my son and I returned from our trip, his room was empty. Where are my son's things? I asked. My sister laughed.



I took the room, I sold everything, got a good price. My mother chuckled. Your sister is pregnant.



I tease only fair, right? My son clung to my clothes, crying. I said nothing and walked away. But later, my sister's smile was gone.



Morning light streamed through the windows of a two-story house facing a tree-lined street, in a quiet residential area near Scottsdale, on the outskirts of Phoenix. It was a pleasant spring morning, before Arizona's harsh heat had set in. Mom, I'm going to borrow some new dinosaur books from the library today.



Rachel Wilson, busy preparing lunch in the kitchen, turned around with a smile at her son Tommy's voice. Those bright blue eyes behind his glasses, and that innocent smile, he looked just like his father Michael. Even now, seven years after the accident, it still tugged at her heart a little every morning.



Still, her beloved son's smile had kept her going all these years. Don't make any stops on your way back from the library. I promise.



But can I borrow two dinosaur books? Of course, but only after you finish your homework. Tommy nodded with a serious expression. His careful and gentle nature would surely make his father proud in heaven.



On the kitchen counter stood Tommy's precious dinosaur figures. The Tyrannosaurus rex, his father's last Christmas present, held a special place among them. On the living room wall hung a photograph of her mother Martha in her nursing uniform, looking dignified in her white coat.



Next to it was her sister Catherine's account and certification, once the family's pride, but now Catherine had returned home seven months pregnant after her divorce, carrying another new lover's child. Rachel, you're always working. We could help more with Tommy as a family, Martha said at breakfast, her mouth turned down in disapproval.



Despite Rachel paying 80% of the $2,000 monthly mortgage, and raising her son alone, Rachel silently sipped her tea. Since her sister's return, her mother's attitude had grown more critical. Tension always lingered at the weekend brunch table.



Their mother talked about Catherine's divorce as if it were someone else's problem. That man was no good she'd say. But Rachel knew the real reason was Catherine's spending habits.



You know, this room gets such nice light. It would make a perfect nursery, Catherine said one day, peering into Tommy's room. In her flashy makeup and designer maternity dress, she hardly looked pregnant.



She surveyed Tommy's room with the air of someone inspecting a showroom. An expensive bag hanging from her shoulder. Why don't we have a garage sale? This house has too much stuff, their mother suggested.



Catherine's eyes lit up. What a wonderful idea mom, I don't need any old things. Rachel felt uneasy but with a major real estate contract pending, she couldn't afford to dwell on it.



The luxury housing development in North Phoenix could be a career-defining deal. The contract was a success. With her long-awaited bonus in hand, Rachel planned a three-day trip to Disneyland with Tommy.



She wanted to create special memories with her son. She had been desperately trying to fill the void left by his father's absence. Make some good memories.



Yes, have a nice time. Catherine and Martha's voices rang out with unusual sweetness. Almost as if they were eager for them to leave the house.



The night before departure, Tommy's room seemed tidier than usual, but Rachel dismissed it as her imagination. Bathed in California sunshine and pleasantly tired, Rachel and Tommy's taxi drove through the streets of Phoenix in the twilight. The dry Arizona wind rattled against the car windows, stirring up dust.



The sun was still high, with the season's characteristic strong Phoenix rays continuing to shine. I can't wait to see my dinosaur figures from dad. I'm going to put the Stegosaurus I bought next to the T-Rex.



Tommy chatted excitedly from the backseat, carefully holding the Stegosaurus figure he'd bought at Disneyland. Rachel smiled gently at the sight. These past three days had been filled with the joy of her son's smiles.



Yes, but only after we unpack our bags. I know. I'll clean my room before I display it.



As the taxi entered their residential area, the familiar tree-lined street came into view, but something was different. An unfamiliar station wagon was parked in front of their house, and on the porch sat what appeared to be a brand-new luxury stroller. Is that one of Aunt Catherine's friends visiting? Rachel couldn't answer Tommy's innocent question, and inexplicable anxiety spread through her chest.



When they opened the front door, the house was eerily quiet. The usual sounds were missing—no TV noise, no Catherine's chatter, no sounds of her mother moving about. It was an unnatural silence, as if someone had deliberately muted all sound.



Mom, something smells weird. Tommy wrinkled his nose. Indeed, it was different from their familiar house smell.



The scent of fresh paint, mixed with the distinctive smell of baby products, wafted through the air. Rachel's anxiety grew as they climbed the stairs. The setting sun streaming into the second-floor hallway seemed to glow red like a warning.



Mom, I want to go to my room quickly. I want to see my T-Rex. Tommy urged, pulling at his mother's hand.



She could feel his small hand trembling slightly. The moment Rachel's hand touched the doorknob to her son's room, she instinctively knew. Something irreversible had happened.



When the door opened, they were confronted with an unfamiliar room, what was once Tommy's room had been completely transformed into a perfect nursery. The walls were painted a soft pale pink, with a state-of-the-art crib by the window. The changing table was neatly arranged with luxury baby items, and the shelves were decorated with cute stuffed animals, still bearing their price tags.



Tommy's belongings had vanished without a trace. Where's Dad's dinosaur? Tommy's voice trembled. At that moment a voice came from behind them.



Oh, you're back early? Turning around, they saw Catherine standing there with a broad smile. She was dressed in expensive maternity wear, looking like she'd stepped out of a magazine. Behind her stood Martha, appearing somewhat uneasy.



Where are my son's things? Rachel's voice was surprisingly calm, even to herself. I took over the room. Sold everything, got a good price too.



Catherine declared proudly, her tone suggesting she was reporting some great achievement, Your sister is pregnant. It's only natural isn't it? Martha added with a small laugh, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. What about the dinosaur Dad gave me? It was his last present.



Tommy's voice shook. Large tears rolled down his cheeks. Oh, that old toy? I sold it all to the second-hand shop.



It wouldn't suit this lovely nursery anyway, Catherine said with a dismissive laugh. Tommy's body began to tremble, clinging to Rachel's clothes. The tremors from his small frame felt like an earthquake.



Come on Tommy. I'll give you a new teddy bear. Isn't this one much cuter? As Catherine reached for a new teddy bear from the shelf, Rachel's voice cut through the air like ice.



Don't touch him. With trembling hands, she took out her smartphone. I'm calling the police.



This is theft. Oh don't be so dramatic, Catherine laughed. Calling the police on family.



How could you do this to family, Martha said in confusion. Her voice tinged with reproach. This ends here, Rachel declared quietly but firmly.



Holding her sobbing Tommy close, Rachel slowly left the room. Behind them, she could hear Catherine and Martha's laughter. An eerie sound.



As if they were enjoying someone else's misfortune. In the car, Tommy asked in a trembling voice. Mom, what are we going to do? Dad's dinosaur? I promise we'll get it back, Rachel vowed, holding her son tightly.



Her voice carried a determination stronger than ever before. This was no longer just a family dispute. It was the beginning of righteous retribution against an unforgivable betrayal.



The fluorescent lights of the Phoenix Police Station illuminated Rachel's tired face. The station was quiet in the late hours, with only the occasional phone ring and keyboard clicks breaking the silence. Detective Sarah Morrison sitting across the desk, studied Rachel with perceptive eyes.



Everything in Tommy's room was disposed of. His clothes, books, toys, and the dinosaur figure that was his father's last gift. Rachel's voice trembled slightly.



We've reviewed the security camera footage, Detective Morrison said, turning her computer screen. Three days ago, in the afternoon, a second-hand dealer's truck was parked in front of your house. The footage shows your sister and mother carrying out multiple boxes and bags.



The video also captured Catherine speaking smugly with the dealer. While Martha helped carry boxes, neither of their expressions showed any sign of guilt. We've also checked social media.



A young officer brought new evidence. The smartphone screen displayed Catherine's Instagram account. In her posts, Tommy's belongings were labeled as unwanted items.



The dinosaur figure, his father's last gift, was among them. We've estimated the total value of the stolen items, Detective Morrison showed some documents. Currently, it amounts to approximately $20,000.



The dinosaur figure collection, in particular, included some premium pieces. Rachel nodded silently. It wasn't about the money.



Her son's memories and the bond with his late father had been ruthlessly stolen. Leaving the police station, Rachel headed to a prominent law firm in Maricopa County. On the top floor of a downtown high-rise, she walked down the marble hallway with determined steps.



There's clear premeditation, Attorney James Foster said, reviewing the evidence documents. Looking at the social media post history, they had been planning this for at least a month. It was a deliberate crime targeting your vacation period.



Foster spread documents across his desk. Furthermore, we have gathered testimonies from neighbors. There are witnesses who heard Catherine openly declaring that she had priority because she was pregnant.



The next move was economic sanctions. At the bank, Rachel initiated the process to stop payments on the family home's mortgage. All documentation of her covering 80% of the monthly $2,000 payment, was on record.



This is a draft of the certified letter, Attorney Foster presented new documents. It details all the evidence of how you've essentially supported the household finances for seven years. That evening, three police cars pulled up in front of the family home.



Neighbors watched the scene unfold from behind curtains. How could you do this? Martha wailed. Calling the police.



Aren't we family? Rachel didn't respond to those cries. Rachel. Do you realize what you're doing, having your pregnant sister arrested? But there was no turning back.



This wasn't mere revenge. It was the pursuit of justice, and the protection of her son's rights. That night, in a hotel room, Rachel gently stroked the cheek of her sleeping Tommy.



Tomorrow would begin a new battle, the legal proceedings in court. But it was a necessary process. I'll get back dad's keepsake, I promise.



Rachel whispered softly. Her voice carried an unwavering determination. The heavy doors of the Maricopa County Courthouse gleamed in the morning light.



Phoenix's early summer sun was already strong, with cicadas chirping in front of the stone courthouse. Rachel sighed deeply as she reviewed the materials received from Attorney Foster. They were having a final meeting in a cafe near the courthouse.



In the air-conditioned interior, her iced coffee cooled her perspiring forehead. We have sufficient evidence, Foster said, his voice full of confidence. Social media post-history, security camera footage, neighbor testimonies, and most importantly, among the mountain of documents spread on the table, there was shocking evidence.



Catherine's social media direct messages revealed conversations with secondhand dealers from three months prior. Can you buy everything from my nephew's room, high price? I want to dispose of it quickly because we're moving. Complete fabrication, Foster pointed out.



There were never any plans to move, it's clearly premeditated theft. Moreover, Martha's bank account movements were suspicious. After Catherine's divorce, large sums were being withdrawn monthly.



Meanwhile, all records of Rachel's continued mortgage payments were submitted as evidence. Your mother was counting on your mortgage payments to support Catherine's luxurious lifestyle. Leaving the cafe, Rachel headed to her new home.



The apartment they'd moved into last week still had boxes piled up everywhere. However, Tommy's new room was already neatly organized. Mom, I'm going to school, Tommy called out cheerfully.



He seemed to be gradually adjusting to his new school. Take care, Rachel called after him, feeling that her son's back looked a little stronger than before. On her way to the courthouse her phone rang.



It was Detective Morrison. We've found new evidence, the detective's voice was excited. Some of Tommy's belongings have been discovered in the secondhand dealer's warehouse, including the dinosaur figures.



Rachel's heart raced, there was still hope to recover his father's last gift. Arriving at the courthouse, reporters had already gathered. The case had drawn local media attention as a controversial story about woman Sue's pregnant sister.



The courtroom was filled with a solemn atmosphere. Heavy wooden furnishings, the American flag, and the judge's bench all emanated dignity. Catherine entered wearing expensive maternity wear, with a tired-looking Martha beside her.



Neither of them spared Rachel a glance. Evidence photos were displayed on the screen one after another. Security camera footage, social media posts, bank transaction records, and the decisive message exchanges.



The defendant had planned this before returning to the family home, the prosecutor addressed the jury. She didn't hesitate to sell even the last gift from her niece's father. Catherine's lawyer tried to emphasize pregnancy-related stress as a factor.



However, this argument fell flat in the face of evidence showing premeditation. We call Tommy Wilson to the stand, Foster announced. Seated in the small witness box, Tommy bravely began speaking in his own words.



The dinosaur that Dad gave me before he went to heaven, it was my treasure. The courtroom fell silent. Grandma and Aunt Catherine took everything from my room.



Even my memories with Dad. During Tommy's testimony, Catherine maintained a defiant smile. Her attitude caused the juror's expressions to change.



Rachel and Catherine crossed paths in the hallway. Why? Rachel asked quietly. Why? You wouldn't understand.



Catherine sneered. Always the perfect sister, playing the ideal mother. Your jealousy hurt my son's heart.



Jealousy, don't make me laugh. I have a new life. Once this baby is born, everything will be mine.



Catherine said, stroking her heavily pregnant belly. In the afternoon session, Martha took the witness stand. I, I just wanted to help Catherine.



Watching her mother testify through tears, Rachel felt complex emotions. But you knew you were selling your grandson's belongings? The prosecutor's questioning left Martha speechless. Finally, Detective Morrison presented the decisive evidence.



The defendant sold the stolen items to multiple secondhand dealers. The total amount comes to $23,475. As the evidence examination concluded, deliberations began.



Rachel closed her eyes in prayer. Beside her sat Tommy, looking exhausted. The deliberation took two hours.



The jury has reached a verdict. As everyone held their breath, the jury foreman stood up. We order the defendant, Catherine Wilson, to pay damages of $30,000.



Furthermore, she is prohibited from approaching the victim and her son. Rachel quietly stood up. Looking at Catherine and Martha she slowly said, this is the end for us.



As they were leaving the courtroom, Detective Morrison caught up with them. Mrs. Wilson. I have one more report.



We can return the dinosaur figures recovered from the secondhand dealer tomorrow. Tommy's eyes lit up. Rachel hugged her son while looking out the window.



The phoenix sky was unusually clear and blue. Morning sunlight streamed through the windows of their new home. Though the view was different from Scottsdale, Rachel and Tommy had grown completely accustomed to this place over the past six months.



Mom, look, the dinosaur room is finished. An energetic voice rang out from upstairs. In Tommy's new room the recovered dinosaur figures were arranged on a special shelf.



The T-Rex, his father's last gift, held a place of honor. New dinosaur books were stacked on the small desk by the window, and dinosaur drawings that Tommy had made were posted on the walls. It's a lovely room, Rachel said.



Gently stroking her son's head. I'm sure Dad would be happy too. Through sessions with a child psychologist, Tommy gradually began to heal his emotional wounds.



At first, he would often wake up from nightmares in the middle of the night. But now, he had made new friends, and regained his former smile. Hey Mom, I got 100% on my math test today.



Tommy showed her his test paper. The teacher said I did really well. Meanwhile their former home stood empty.



With the mortgage payments in default, it was ultimately foreclosed. Martha and Catherine were forced to move to a trailer park on the outskirts of Phoenix. One holiday Rachel went out to lunch with her work colleagues.



The conversation naturally turned to that incident. Have you heard about Catherine? Jennifer lowered her voice to say. After giving birth, she developed postpartum depression and can't take care of the baby.



I heard Martha is taking care of it, another colleague added, but it seems the newborn care is too much for someone her age. Rachel silently listened while staring into her coffee cup. According to rumors on social media, Catherine was still splurging on luxury brands.



However, life in the trailer house must have been far from the new life she had imagined. I heard they can't get any support, Jennifer continued. Nobody in the community wants to get involved.



Even the church groups are keeping their distance. Karma, her colleagues' voices carried a hint of satisfaction. That evening, Rachel was enjoying the cool evening air on the small patio in their garden.



The Arizona night breeze gently caressed her cheeks. Mom, Tommy sat down beside her. How are Grandma and Aunt Catherine doing, Rachel hesitated for a moment.



But looking into her son's clear eyes, she decided to answer honestly. They're going through a difficult time, but that's the result of their choices. They're not happy like us, well.



Rachel drew her son close. But we have what's truly important don't we, yes, Tommy answered with a smile, Dad's dinosaurs and Mom, and. He looked up at their new house.



This home, and kind friends too. Stars twinkled in the night sky. The bustle of Phoenix echoed in the distance.



A year later, life continued in the trailer park for Catherine and Martha. Catherine's designer clothes gradually became worn, and her social media followers dwindled day by day. Her child, left at daycare, never truly knew a mother's love.



Meanwhile, Rachel's new home had become a place for regular weekend barbecues. Neighborhood families would gather. Children playing in the yard while adults chatted about work and life.



Hey Mom, Tommy asked one night before bed, we're happy aren't we? Yes we are, Rachel answered embracing her son. We have what truly matters. The dinosaurs lined up on the room's shelves stood silently in the moonlight.



They were more than just figures they were memories of his father. Symbols of the bond between mother and son, and monuments to the triumph of justice. The night sky visible from their new home's window was always blue and clear.



There lay genuine happiness that could never be broken.

1qtlwuq,https://v.redd.it/zma01928k0hg1,That Scraping Sound Again,"Another night.

That red EXIT sign is the only thing keeping the night from standing still. It flickers like a broken heartbeat—steady for a while, then suddenly stuttering and throwing red light across the landing before fading again. The stairwell lights are just as bad, making the whole place look bruised and battered.

I’m still the new guy here, the one nobody really notices. I’ve been talking to myself all shift just to fill the silence, but now it feels like the quiet is watching me, wide awake and waiting.

""It’s been almost two weeks. The coffee tastes awful. The thermostat never works—freezing one minute, boiling the next. And here I am, talking to the walls like this is just how things are now!""

I let out a quick snort, but the sound disappears fast, swallowed by the hallway. The quiet comes back even stronger.

I turn the corner onto B-4.

Whoa. The door's wide open.

Not just cracked.

Not halfway.

Fully swung out, ninety freaking degrees.

A harsh strip of yellow light spills into the hallway, too bright and too deep. The stairwell is full of strange shadows, stretched tight at the bottom, like something is tearing reality apart.

The EXIT sign flashes hard once, and for a moment, the landing seems to twist, as if we’re underwater and sinking slowly.

And there it is again.

That scrape.

The dragging sound lasts longer this time, slow and careful. What is it moving? Rags? Flesh? Something wet and heavy? It’s not in a hurry—it wants me to hear every bit of it, to feel it deep inside.

I stop in my tracks. There’s no use getting closer—the smell hits me anyway. It’s musty plaster, old pennies, and a sickly sweet rot that makes my stomach turn.

Sanity check time.

I take a deep breath in, hold it, then let it out, just like that app said would help with nightmares. But after my first shift, those dreams stuck with me until morning.

Door's still gaping.

Red light's still pulsing.

Scrape's moving closer, patient as death. One long drag... three pulses... repeat.

I pinch the skin between my thumb and finger, hard enough to make my eyes tear.

Zip. Nada. No glitch-out, no blackout, no sweet escape to morning coffee.

This is real. Too real.

I could run over and slam the door shut, hear the latch click and feel like I won. I could pretend it was just a careless maintenance guy who forgot to close up, but the log says nobody’s been on this floor since Friday.

But the second I picture stepping over that line? Scraping cuts off. Dead silent.

Then... slow, almost too polite... a wet knock echoes from inside.

Not on the door.

On the concrete wall, just out of it sounds almost like a gentle voice whispering in my ear, strangely inviting. very inviting sound.

My swallow sticks in my throat, loud as a click amid the quiet.

Nope. Not going in.

Not slamming it.

I backpedal slowly, eyes glued to that black maw of a doorway, heart beating fast, waiting for something pallid, twisted, wrong to slink into view.

Nothing.

I keep backing up until the hallway curves and the nightmare is out of sight. Then I hurry—half walking, half jogging—to the service elevator. The red EXIT light follows me, reflecting off each shiny surface, every window, every fire extinguisher strip. It feels like something is watching me.

Doors slide open before I even jab the button. Creepy as hell.

I jump in, hit the LOBBY button, and press CLOSE as fast as I can, like everything depends on it.

The car jerks up, and through the shut doors? One last scrape, fainter, muffled, almost chuckling.

Eighty-six minutes till shift's over.

I can hold out.

I went back into the security office, every light switch was on, back jammed against the wall, staring down the stairwell cam feed.

That door is still yawning open on screen.

Red EXIT pulses in sync with my racing heart.

No motion.

No shadow sneaking across.

Yet.

I mutter it'll be shut by daybreak, janitor, facilities hack, miracle.

Still deep down? I know the truth.

It's not shutting down.

It's waiting.

Wider tomorrow.

Even wider after that.

Till one night, I drag myself down here, and the door? Gone.

Stairs plunging forever.

Down. Down. Down.

And at the bottom? Something patient as eternity, lurking for the rookie who quit whining...

And finally tuned in.

1qtluu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Barnesandnoble/comments/1qtluu2/im_done/,I’m done,"Or at least I WISH I were. Like many and most thirty-somethings, I have financial obligations in a job market that’s utter trash, in a city with especially poor job prospects.

But the moment something else takes me? I’m out like a rabbit in a fox den.

I used to joke that I was the store bicycle because I’m trained in a multitude of areas, some even people who’ve been here longer than \*I\* have never even had to learn. Ergo, I’m spread around constantly and backing up everywhere or being assigned places when people call out or are on vacation. I don’t know what the method for deciding who gets trained in what and when is, but it’s probably a similar method to whatever possessed my know-dick-all SM and DM to decide what may very well be my thirteenth reason why I quit.

So despite being already understaffed and already having very few crosstrained employees, they (most likely more our DM tbh) decided that cafe will now only have two people scheduled on average: One to open, one to close. The one who’s not in cafe is on bookfloor and will only be in cafe other to backup. Not help them get things situated, mind you, but if there’s a line. Otherwise, stay on the floor.

…Here’s the thing: See, our store is one of the only ones in the broad area. It’s in a suburban-enough shopping area, and there’s lots of schools nearby. You can imagine we’re high-traffic. Oh, and we’re two stories, no pun intended. That’s-a big store. I wish I hadn’t lost my Fitbit because I know there’ve been some 10K+ step days.

Adding insult to injury is the fact that I \*know\* our DM doesn’t know how shit works. She’s constantly making bad calls, including changing our music department from an organization that lowered our theft numbers to one that has it right back up there again. All because she saw how snother store did it. (Also while we’re at it, she had somebody sell a Barbie that rang up as SOS. The entire situation was weird but the fact that she put a bookseller on the spot like that is extremely crappy imo.)

But I digress because our SM? Despite being a manager — THE manager — he doesn’t know how to do a thing in cafe besides get water. Of the eight or so managerial/keyholder positions we have in the store, only two are actually trained for our cafe. Another has barista experience but, like, in an actual coffee shop, so her experience is different. Another is eager to learn, but I doubt she’ll ever be given an opportunity or time to move beyond register. Especially not with this new plan in place.

Genuinely asked one keyholder on a scale of 1-10, how fired would I be if I confronted the SM and asked him what his experience in cafe was. Because I don’t think you can make that call if you don’t know exactly what goes into the upkeep of a cafe that gets regulars, students in lunch and study groups, and families with a haul of squealing kids. Oh, and that’s before taking note of stock and replenishment, doing tasks, doing the EXTRA tasks they padded on to make the cafe look tidier, etc.

That’d be like me deciding we don’t need a bunch of keyholders, the SM can handle all those tasks. No, no, it’s fine, guys. He can do authorizations, do tills, hop on calls, do tip-ins, etc until the closing manager comes in. I mean, \*I’ve\* never done any of these things, but it can’t be THAT hard!

I was assigned shelf-talker duty nearly half a year ago, was given no time to actually work on them, and yet was given a shocked Pikachu face when told to check off all the sections I’d finished and I straight up said only the ones from earlier in 2025 were finished. Anything after August? Incomplete. I barely care anymore at this point because I don’t know what they expected to happen.

Not a big deal? Fair! But let me say this: I’ve been feeling so overworked and overwhelmed that recently I’ve felt stress bad enough to make me wonder if a panic attack would be the only way to reach catharsis. I’ve been getting migraines from grinding my teeth and noticed I’ve been way too close to hyperventilating now than I ever have before in my pre-Barnes life. My evals always mention how I’m one of the employees they’re most likely to call in because I usually answer right away and can do multiple tasks, but at the end of the day that doesn’t mean they won’t and haven’t already manufactured my schedule to be so shit that I’m forced to take up inconvenient shifts so that I’m not working only 20 hrs in a week.

Something about this job has broken something in me. I used to work full-time at a restaurant that didn’t close until 10 or 11, depending on the night. It was the most depressing job I’ve had to date, and yet I still had the energy on my days off to go out and do something fun or indulge in my hobbies. But BN? I’m part-time and I’m lucky if I have the energy to go to the grocery store on my days off. I just feel so drained and my body’s finding new ways to ache. 

I know I’m not spouting anything new. But my god: I almost started screaming today. Not even words: Just actual animalistic screams of anguish and overstimulation caused by bottling up a lot of BS over the years. You know it’s bad when the coworkers are agreeing that you keep getting screwed over by how much management had come to rely on your dependability just to make a single shift somewhat survivable. If I go — as many in my store are already apparently planning to — that place is screwed.

Hell, it’s screwed even if I stay. But at least if I leave, I don’t have to deal with this particular concoction of bullshit. 

Anyway, wish me luck: I’m going to start watching videos on data entry and applying to jobs and hoping for the best. And to all who are ready to flee, I wish you the same and salute you. Don’t be like me: Know and respect your worth.",8,1770008456.0,Barnesandnoble,3,0.9,False

[Original Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2019/06/my-boss-got-weirdly-aggressive-about-winning-a-game-and-now-wont-stop-claiming-im-angry-about-it.html)  **June 19, 2019**


I work for a large company. Previously I was in a small team which supported a small department, but at the start of the year it was decided we would merge with another team and become the support group for the whole sector. The new team is headed by Ethel. It was agreed by management that we could have a “team building” afternoon out of the office for the newly mixed team to get to know each other better. Ethel decided we’d do a games tournament.

We split into small teams. I was on one and Ethel on the other. It was pretty fun, playing team games and solving puzzles. And it was nice to chat to my new colleagues in an informal setting. There was inevitable friendly competition but all very light-hearted and harmless. Bizarrely though, Ethel took it incredibly seriously. She got really aggressive, shouting that my team were losers and couldn’t keep up. Every time our teams crossed paths, she’d berate us and laugh. It made the whole thing awkward and added a weird tension to the day, but as we didn’t all know each other and she was the boss, nobody really challenged it.


We actually did end up narrowly losing in the end (maybe Ethel successfully psyched us out) as the other team beat us to first place by just a few points. I wasn’t particularly bothered, competition isn’t really my thing – which is perhaps what spurred Ethel on, but she latched onto me. She made a whole show of her team winning, and the organizer (who looked very uncomfortable by it all) had brought jokey little plastic medals for the winners, which made it worse. We cheered for them and said well done, but Ethel started waving her medal in my face, calling me a loser and laughing. I just stood there not reacting as I was so confused by it all. At one point I laughed back and jokingly said I’d never seen a sore winner before, but it only made her worse – she kept going on about how obviously mad I was (?) and how it must be hard being such a loser. My team and I were just baffled by it all, and hers all looked hideously embarrassed. I was really mortified that this was my first interaction with the new half of my team.

It’s been months since, and the team has melded together well. But even now, Ethel will occasionally pull her medal out of her desk drawer and wave it in the air, loudly asking (so others could hear) if I remembered the time she beat us. This happens every few weeks. She even tells new hires about it, and goes into how angry I was and how much I’d been rattled. I think she thinks it’s a funny in-joke we share, but I don’t find it funny at all.



I’ve tried saying “It’s been months, why are we still talking about this?” but that adds fuel to her theory that I’m raging inside and spurs her on. I’ve tried laughing it off and that has the same effect — she claims I’m covering up my feelings. Once I just flat out ignored her and she started pointing out to other colleagues that I’m too angry to talk. The whole time she’s laughing like it’s some big joke. I even mentioned it privately in our one-on-one, but she started laughing and joking about my “obsession with losing.”

I feel like this makes me look bad in front of the team, especially new hires. I have a reputation for being very calm and unflappable at work and I’m wondering if this is a weird attempt to undermine that. I also wonder if this is her way of trying to win over new hires and have something “fun” to talk about with them, as she is a bit socially awkward. Other team members have mentioned to me how weird it is and I don’t think she realizes that it just makes everyone uncomfortable.

Am I insane to let this get to me? How do I approach her and get her to stop without her insisting I’m a sore loser who can’t take a joke? Ironically I had zero feelings about this when it happened, but now when I see her pull the medal out I do admit I start raging inside, like she says! I also feel like as she’s my boss I have to be careful in how I talk to her.



I just don’t know where to go from here, and I’m annoyed I’m even having to write about it!

[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2019/08/update-my-boss-got-weirdly-aggressive-about-winning-a-game-and-now-keeps-claiming-im-angry-about-it.html)  **Aug 29, 2019 (over 2 months later)**

A few weeks after your advice and kind words from the readers, the medal showing continued but generally I felt better about it. I understood it wasn’t affecting how I was perceived by the wider team and it was Ethel’s issue rather than mine. I still got annoyed, but found it easier to let go.

Then I had a terrible afternoon: I had to help set up the conference room for a large meeting for a senior director and everything went wrong – catering didn’t arrive, the tech failed … you get it. It was a nightmare and although I sorted it all out without fall-out, it was a very high-stress situation with the director breathing down my neck to fix it. After I got back to my desk to finally exhale, my team knew about the drama and asked me if I was OK, did I need a coffee, etc. I would’ve been fine after a few minutes to decompress but Ethel, being Ethel, must’ve thought this was a good time to “lighten the mood” and, to my horror, got out the damn medal and started the routine. I felt myself going red and on the verge of tears, it was just the last thing I needed. I pretended I had left something in the conference room and excused myself.

Ethel followed, pulled me into a meeting room, and asked what was wrong and the floodgates opened. I was so worked up from the problems earlier and she caught me on my last nerve. I told her, quite heatedly, that I hated the medal speech and how small it made me, I didn’t think it was funny, and I just felt embarrassed in front of everyone each time she did it. She knew very well that I was stressed right now, so I couldn’t understand why she thought I wanted to be mocked in front of colleagues on top of everything else. She was genuinely shocked and didn’t know what to say. Eventually she apologized and quietly said she wouldn’t do it again and she thought it was just a fun joke “between friends” and it was meant to be funny. I said I appreciated her finally dropping it and could we just put it behind us, move on, and work together as normal.

After that I tried to go on as normal and treat it as a clean slate, but she was very awkward around me. She treated me with kid gloves, spoke to me solely about work queries and nothing else, didn’t make any jokes around me, and delicately checked in to see if I was OK with handling basic tasks I’d been doing for years. Our one-to-ones were just us both reading out bullet points of work questions. My colleagues sensed the obvious atmosphere and some asked privately if something had happened, which annoyed me – why couldn’t she be professional enough to act normally?! The medal wasn’t seen again though. I did wonder about going to HR, but felt she wasn’t really doing anything wrong on paper despite the weird vibe, I hadn’t been penalized for anything, the medal had gone, and my pay raise went through as normal, so I felt it best to leave it alone.

Some more background on Ethel: she’s great at the operational side of her job, really efficient and experienced. She gets things done and manages the workload well. She previously managed a small team with the same function as us, which is why the higher-ups felt she’d be good to head up the new, larger team. The problem is she’s not a great people person, she can be quite abrupt and struggles under pressure – everyone around her is aware when she’s having a bad day because she’s very vocal about it. If people interrupt up her at a bad time, she will hold up a single “one moment” finger and not look at them until she’s ready. She once told me she scored really poorly on an emotional intelligence test. So she hadn’t really clicked with a few members of the team and even had a few outright clashes. I also think she struggled with adjusting to having more direct reports than she was used to. One of my closer colleagues suggested that Ethel picked on me as she was a bit jealous as I had a good rapport with the team and she has struggled to build that herself, but even if that’s the case, it’s her job as my boss to be professional.

But I have now left, and have a new job! It wasn’t all about Ethel, I’d just been at that company a good five years and wanted something new. In a way I’m glad I confronted her about it. Even though it was in a more heated way than I’d like, it stopped her – but it also broke down our relationship. I don’t blame myself though. Thanks Alison and to everyone who wrote helpful comments and advice, my new boss and I have a normal working relationship and I’m not mocked in front of my team about stupid games!

So I need some advice about a potential job offer.

Context: My previous role was made redundant at the end of November last year and I've been job hunting ever since. In my desperation, I applied for a 6 month contract role at a FS company to cover someone while they are are on maternity leave.

I've done the interview and I received a missed call this morning from HR (I was busy doing school drop off since it was first day of school so I didn't hear the phone). In the voice message, the HR rep said they wanted to discuss the outcome of my interview and to discuss next steps. I haven't called them back yet but I'm assuming that 'next steps' would mean that I got the job.

However, I have another interview tomorrow with another company that I more keen to join. It's a permanent full time role and it's in an exciting new industry that I would be really keen to get in and learn. I've already met with the hiring manager last week for a coffee and I would like to believe I made a good impression and hopefully would be in good standing to be offered the role.

So what should I do? A part of me thinks that if offered, I should accept the 6 month contract role for now since it'll at least give me some security for the next 6 months...but if I do get the other permanent role, would it look bad on me to leave the contract role so soon after starting?

Edit: I should also note that the difference in pay between both roles is negligible. Both roles pay about the same. The contract role is a team led role managing 5 people while the permanent role is a senior and I won't have to manage anyone. ",4,1770008167.0,auscorp,15,0.7,False
