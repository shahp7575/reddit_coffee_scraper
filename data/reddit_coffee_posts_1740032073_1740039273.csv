1itthl8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itthl8,I roasted for the first time in my life,"I've used a little cheap oven which was in my hands reach. But next time I'll try the heatgun bread machine method. I just wanted to have a first time experience that I can learn from and it was great to come up with questions for you guys. So.

My experience

I did three tests, the first time I started with 190 C and with a little batch just 30 grams of coffee (sorry I don't get fahrenheit I'm European). What I'm aiming for is light roast mostly because I like that better and because I don't have an espresso machine I only do filters so yeah I know I hit my axe in a really heavy wood. It's been said on this sub that espresso is a little more forgiving. But you know I was like I'm ready let's do this lmao.

I used Sidamo Ethiop beans and I have no idea of the process or the variant sadly it wasn't on the pack. Next time I'll look for better beans but I figured for start it should be fine I'll mess shit up anyway. 

Okay first time was awful lol. I waited for browning and then I shook them a bit and put them in back. I did that like thrice because I was scared and excited. I was like shit shit I don't even know what I'm doing. So the outcome was extremely uneven and burnt in some places. It was slow 3 minutes til browning and then 10 min to first crack. 

On the second try I did it with 200C which was more consistent I didn't shook them too much anymore. Browning happened quicker and 9 minutes in for first crack. 

On the third I tried 210 C. 7 minutes til first crack. I left it there more because I don't know if all of the beans have to crack like a popcorn or... Question later. So I wasn't sure when it's ready. Then I took them out immediately and cooled them. Well I don't think puting them in a freezer is a good way to cool but I did it anyway because I didn't know better and I knew I had to cool them like FAST. Next time I think I'll get a hair dryer which can blow cool air. 

Okay I'm cupping them today but first I have tons of questions.

- How to change the temperature over time what's the steps? Or should it be consistent throughout the process? Say if I do it on 190C should I decrease the temperature after browning or keep it until it cracks? 

- How do I know after a cupping what to change? If it tastes off or burnt? Or nothing at all? 

- When it cracks first should I wait for all of them to pop or if one bean pops it happens to the others in a chemical reaction even if I can't hear it? 

- How much should I wait before cupping them?

- How come I can cup fresh roasting after a short time but before I make coffee out of them I should wait like three weeks? I have experience with freshly roasted coffee and I know it is way better after I waited.

- Chaff control. My experience was not that messy I was afraid it'll be but how to remove chaff properly from the beans? Will it spoil the taste in the cupping phase? 

- How will I know how to choose the green beans? Is there any way to taste or try them before roasting? 

- How will I know what to get out of them? How to know when I reached the golden point?

- How to cool it off? I guessed the freezer was not the best solution but will it ruin the flavors? 

Thank you guys for the help and the answers. I'm eager to learn.

I'm in the process of planning my living room for the home I'll be moving into in a month. I want to keep my spending around ‚Ç¨2500 and have put together a rough list of items I‚Äôm considering (mostly from IKEA):

I already have plenty of plants (Monstera Thai Con, Anthurium Clarinervium, a terrarium, Philodendron Gloriosum, Strelitzia Nicolai, etc.), so greenery is covered!

I know my setup might seem low on storage, but I have built-in storage in my bedroom across an entire wall and an extra storage space near the living room, so I *think* I‚Äôll be fine.

Would love to hear your thoughts! Any recommendations for things I should change, good IKEA alternatives, or items worth buying second-hand?

We usually sat or walked around.

Before school started, we met some of the same people, a couple of whom became my best friends. Even though we were placed in different sections and had different classes, I always invited her to hang out with my friends from my section.

A few weeks into school, my friend Anna texted me to see if I was going to the beach with her and Kate. Kate never mentioned it to me, and when I asked if she had plans, she lied and said she was going on a solo walk‚Äîwhen in reality, Anna was picking her up. When I confronted her, she claimed she liked one-on-one time with friends, started crying, and canceled her plans. It was weird, but I tried to be understanding.

Then it became a pattern. She started inviting my other close friend, Natalie, on frequent runs, telling her she loved that they had ‚Äútheir own thing.‚Äù When intramurals started, I joined a softball team with Kate. She later excitedly told me she also joined an intramural soccer team‚Äîsomething we had both talked about wanting to do‚Äîbut didn‚Äôt extend the invite. The next day, some guys at school asked if I wanted to play, so I joined. At every softball and soccer game, Kate basically ignored my existence.

She kept making new friends while still reaching out to my closest ones for coffee dates and hangouts‚Äîwithout me. I still never excluded her, but one day, after she told me she was getting coffee with a friend, I had also wanted to go study at a coffee shop so I invited my friend Anna and another girl to go study. We ended up at the same place. Later, Kate said she wanted to talk, started crying, and said she felt left out. I immediately flipped the conversation and pointed out that she was the one doing that to me. She admitted she had been doing that but said she didn‚Äôt know why. At one point, I asked ‚Äúis the reason you‚Äôre inviting my friends to hang out without me because‚Ä¶‚Äù and she finished my sentence and said ‚Äúto make up for the time you‚Äôre spending with them? No, I‚Äôm not doing that.‚Äù This all seemed like jealousy and insecurity at this point.

She then told me she was upset that I joined intramurals because she ‚Äúwanted it to be her thing,‚Äù yet she had no problem copying things from my life‚Äîtrying to be best friends with my closest friends, applying to a big law firm I liked (despite always wanting to be a public defender) and made sure to tell me about it, and now, signing up for the exact Madrid study abroad program I told her about a year ago. Only four students get to go, she had never expressed interest in Spain before, and there were 15 other cities to choose from.

Now, she‚Äôs reaching out to the other two girls in the program to make plans for us to all to get drinks together soon. She is the last person I‚Äôd want back in my life. Also, I assume she‚Äôll live with the other girls while I live with my boyfriend, but I worry that if I want to be close to them, I‚Äôll have to deal with her too. I want to be able to travel with the other two girls and get close to them, but I‚Äôm scared Kate is going to always be around when I feel like I need to just stay away from her. She was not a good friend to me, and I highly doubt she‚Äôs changed.

I go check pilot lights, our propane tank, etc. I come back in and see the battery's back out. I ask her did it go off again, she says yes and I ask her why she took the battery out, well it was annoying is what she says to me.

I don't know if I'm scared, being too analytical, whatever. Don't get me wrong I'm not perfect, Im logical not lover, I plan for life not dates, so she doesn't get a romantic man and I understand that is also a difficult thing to deal with and want to marry.

When I was a teenager my¬† family had a swimming pool and one day I was swimming alone in the pool as I may have been home alone and I dived into the pool far too deep for the pool itself and as a result of the dive my chin hit the bottom of the pool with a loud clicking sound and with much force: that‚Äôs God that saved me from being paralysed as I hit the bottom of the pool with a lot of force and my life could have ended with me floating or sinking in the pool and drowning as I was by myself in the pool and if I was paralysed I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to save myself and get out of the pool.

When I meet Jackie at a Christian Youth Group called Young Life and we date each other and my mum tells me after just a couple of weeks that I should let Jackie know how I feel about her and so in one night a week later I do and we go from boyfriend and girlfriend to steady to engaged on that one night as I propose to her and she says ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù and I don‚Äôt even have a ring and I wasn‚Äôt planning to propose on that night, and it just happened and I‚Äôd known Jackie for less than six weeks at the time: that‚Äôs God who gave me a mother who got me to follow my heart and not my head for Jackie had already captured my heart and she still has it and mums know who is right for their boy.

We got married on 5th December 1981 and the next day we set out on our honeymoon. We're on the freeway heading north from Hornsby on our way to Forster and a woman in the lane next to us has a trailer and she puts on her blinker and starts to move over, but we're in her blind spot and I try to move over and give her room and slow down but we're all at highway speeds and she is still moving over more and more into my lane and I'm blasting my horn and she's entering my lane leaving me with no place to go as there was traffic bollards on the side of the road and I'm almost into them and she finally hears me and realises that I'm there and moves back into her lane: that's God protecting us on our honeymoon from a dangerous start to our married life.

When we are newly married and we are renting a unit in West Ryde, and a bill comes in that we cannot pay and then a cheque arrives in the mail the day after we get that bill, and it is not too late to pay the bill, and we weren't expecting the cheque. We did not know the cheque was even coming and it is for a couple of dollars less than the bill and now we can pay the bill: that's God looking after us financially in the early months of our marriage.

When we‚Äôre renting that unit and we ask if we can put in a deadlock and the real estate says Yes as long as we give them a set of keys and leave the lock in the door after we vacate the unit and a couple of months later all of the units in the unit block were burgled except for ours and one other, as both of these two units had deadlocks and the other units did not: that‚Äôs God giving us the idea to become more secure in our living arrangements and prevented us from being burgled.

When we have a car and it‚Äôs our first car and someone steals it from the unit carpark, and fortunately it was found on that day, but it was written off: that‚Äôs God who enabled the police to find the car without us having to wait months for the insurance company to decide when they would have pay out the claim if the car had not been found and recovered at all.

We‚Äôre renting the unit at West Ryde and it‚Äôs almost time to renew the lease or move out and we haven‚Äôt made up our mind which way we‚Äôre going to jump, my parents decide to go on an extended holiday for a couple of months overseas, the decision is made for us as we‚Äôre asked to housesit for them and we don‚Äôt have much furniture and my parents have prepaid all of their bills so we don‚Äôt have any to pay for them: that‚Äôs God providing us with a place to live in rent free while they‚Äôre away and when they‚Äôre back.

When we move out of my parent‚Äôs house, we find a unit to rent for a year in Meadowbank and during that year and the time we spent at my parent‚Äôs house before that we save up enough money for a deposit on another unit in Meadowbank which we buy: that‚Äôs God getting us out of the rental market and into a mortgaged unit which we owned.

When we‚Äôve been married for six years and both of our parents ask when we are going to give them grandchildren, and we‚Äôve not even thought about having children as we‚Äôve been too busy with work, holidays and looking after my younger brother Christopher on many occasions and we decide to try to have a child, and it only takes six weeks for Jackie to fall pregnant after being on the pill for eight years and she carries Michelle to full term. Michelle was born with the aid of forceps as she was not positioned right for the birth and then the birth went smoothly because of the skill of the doctor and the use of the forceps: that‚Äôs God looking after Jackie and Michelle and granting the wishes of our parents.

When we realise how difficult it would be to bring up a baby in a top floor unit without a laundry, and disposable nappies were not around then, we decide to sell the unit and buy a house, but first we must find a buyer for the unit and find a house for us to live in. The unit gets sold on the day it was listed and then the house hunt begins and we find a house to buy and we move in before our daughter was born: that‚Äôs God who found us the buyer so quick and even though we looked at many houses, God found us one to buy at the right time so we were able to move into the house on the same day that the unit sale was finalised when the new owners took possession of the unit.

When we‚Äôre shopping at Blacktown Westpoint and Michelle is a year old or so we have a trolley and a pram and a package to get out of the lift, we push the pram out first and then both Jackie and I go back into the lift to get the rest and the lift door shuts on us and the lift starts moving up to the next floor leaving¬† Michelle left by herself in her pram¬† on the floor that we just came from. We hurried down to that floor after the lift stopped higher up and found the pram surrounded by several elderly ladies, all wondering where the mother was: that‚Äôs God who enabled Michelle not to be all alone but have the attention of the ladies and she wasn‚Äôt taken away by anyone or abducted.

When I hit a semi-trailer and all I get is a written-off car as I had lost control of the car on a wet road, and we were headed for a telegraph pole and I slid across three lanes of the road without being in control of the car but hit the truck instead and were pushed by the impact back into the lane we started in instead of being wrapped around the pole. The car gets written off by the insurance company. Nothing happens to me, my wife Jackie gets whiplash and gets over it successfully, and our two-year-old daughter Michelle gets the imprint of the buckle from her safety child car seat on her stomach, and the child car seat gets replaced by the insurance company, but she is fine. Years later we have a second child, Marcus, who would not have been born if we had perished in the crash, and decades later than that I realise how fortunate we were to have survived the crash as we would not have had Marcus if we‚Äôd died, and he would never have existed: that's God looking after us and our son that we hadn‚Äôt even conceived at that time and God who put the truck in the right place to stop us from hitting the telegraph pole.

When we try for another child and months go on and we lose heart and think it‚Äôs going to happen and it doesn‚Äôt, we stop actively trying for a child and then Jackie falls pregnant after we‚Äôd given up trying for one: that‚Äôs God who gave us a second child in his own time.

When my youngest child, Marcus was a couple of years old, and my wife Jackie is doing housework, and she is home alone with Marcus, she hears an audible voice inside the room she‚Äôs in and it‚Äôs spoken out aloud, and no-one is there, and the voice is saying to her to go and check on Marcus. She goes out the front of the house to look for him and he is on the road, and she gathers him to her and takes him back inside and he is safe from any potential harm from any vehicle on the road: that's God protecting Marcus and directly interacting with Jackie.

When we‚Äôre on holiday in Dubbo and we‚Äôre all in a huge op-shop and our four-year-old son, Marcus, goes off by himself which he usually does in a store but usually he stays in any store that we‚Äôre in but this time he leaves the store, and we didn't know. My wife and my daughter and I look for him and he is not in the store. So, we leave the store, and we turn to the left, not the right, although we had no idea which way he went, and we start walking up away from the store. Then we meet up with a man and his wife walking toward us and he's holding Marcus in his arms and Marcus is safe and the man says he picked up Marcus as Marcus was crossing a road by himself at the pedestrian crossing and it didn't look right to the man, as Marcus wasn't walking with any parents and so he picks up Marcus and backtracks with Marcus to see if he can find us and he does find us and we're reunited with our son: that's God keeping our family safe and together and for providing us with a couple who saw the danger that Marcus was in as he was by himself.

When we‚Äôre on holidays driving back from Melbourne to Sydney and our children are young and we‚Äôre at a roadside rest stop and it's got a toilet, and our older child Michelle wants to go to the toilet and off she goes, and I realise to my horror that it‚Äôs probably a pit toilet and I tell my wife Jackie to run after our daughter and my wife gets there and manages to save our daughter from disappearing into the pit of poo and wee that‚Äôs below the toilet seat because the toilet is made for adult bottoms, not smaller children‚Äôs bottoms and fortunately our child left the toilet door open so Jackie was able to grab her before she disappeared into the pit below her: that's God looking after Michelle for she almost fell in and she probably would have drowned in the pit if she did fall in.

When we‚Äôre so broke, that all we could afford to eat was sausages and potato mash for weeks that we're feeding our family and my wife Jackie talks to some of the ladies at the church we‚Äôre going to at the time and she talks about how hard we‚Äôre finding it financially and someone, that we never find out who did it, puts an envelope in the offering tray with our name on it and it has a $100 in notes in it. In the nineties, $100 was considered a substantial amount of money. The envelope containing the money was given to us by one of the church‚Äôs elders: that‚Äôs God helping us when we were at our lowest financial point.

After leaving that church as Marcus was a bit too much for them, we started going to another church and the two of us, both Jackie and I went through the waters of an adult baptism: that‚Äôs God enabling us publicly to acknowledge him as our Lord.

When my wife Jackie had a series of mini-strokes, and we already had two children and we were told that she had to go off the pill right then and that I would need a vasectomy as an operation to tie her tubes would have been too dangerous for Jackie to have as would another pregnancy and childbirth as she could die from either and I went ahead with getting the vasectomy and we had counselling. I wanted to keep Jackie safe and alive and well, and we made the right decision about me getting the vasectomy: that‚Äôs God telling me to keep my wife safe by me getting the vasectomy and enabling Jackie to be still alive, otherwise I would have become a widower with small children.

After experiencing chest pain for several months, I visited a doctor at the recommendation of my wife. X-rays, ultrasounds, and a biopsy showed my thyroid gland had significantly enlarged and extended into the chest cavity. It was pushing my oesophagus and windpipe out of the way and pushing against my other organs in my chest and closing my oesophagus and windpipe up by squishing them together and if it wasn‚Äôt for my wife getting me to see the doctor I would have died once the windpipe had fully closed because I could live without food if my oesophagus had closed but I can‚Äôt live without air if my windpipe had closed. Getting a hole put in my neck would not have worked for breathing as the windpipe and oesophagus were much lower down in my chest cavity where they were being squished. The surgeon was able to remove the thyroid through my neck as he was thinking at first of cracking open my ribcage to get at the thyroid from below it as it was deep, far down into my chest cavity, which would have had more risks and a longer period of recovery, but he was able to remove the thyroid through my neck and hide the scar in a skin fold: that‚Äôs God who got me through the whole process of getting the medical and surgical help that I needed.

When I‚Äôm awaiting a phone call to find out if my thyroid was cancerous as I had a biopsy and I‚Äôm at work and a workmate tells me that my wife is on the phone for me and my wife Jackie says, ""There's no cancer"" and right then at that moment I feel two hands on my shoulders from behind me. I turn around to see who touched me and nobody was there, the nearest member of staff was three metres in front of me, and it wasn‚Äôt her, yet I felt the hands on both of my shoulders, it was a physical touch as I did feel them: that's God interacting physically with me.

When I‚Äôm on holidays with my family in Melbourne and we're lost and parked on the side of the road and a truck comes over the hill from behind us and hits our car, but all the truck hit was our driver's door exterior mirror and that was the only part of the car that got broken and it could have been a lot worse if the truck had been a little bit closer to us as our car would have been pushed forwards violently by the truck and it would had been a bad accident, potentially a fatal one: that's God looking after my family and I by keeping us safe.

When I am on that holiday to Melbourne with my family, and we are on a bus, and we are having a bit of difficulty with settling Marcus and a lady comes over and prays for me and my family and Marcus settles down and we really needed that prayer of intercession and I think the lady was nudged by God to pray for us as she said that God told her to pray for us and she did: that's God getting us buoyed up by her timely prayer

When I see a cat on TV that‚Äôs twitching and moving while being asleep and it moves so much that it falls off the coffee table that it‚Äôs on and the commentator says the cat has Rem Sleep Behaviour Disorder and I tell my wife, ‚ÄúLook, that‚Äôs me.‚Äù I have been having dreams where I become active while dreaming instead of remaining passive and I move around and fall out of bed whilst being fast asleep. I go to the hospital and see a sleep specialist and have a sleep study and get diagnosed with Rem Sleep Behaviour Disorder and the sleep doctor started talking about Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and my short term memory issues: that‚Äôs God who got me to watch a TV program that I didn‚Äôt know was on and got me to make the connection between me and my sleeping behaviour and the cat and its sleeping behaviour and that led to a diagnosis of Rem Sleep Behaviour Disorder for me.

When I had a shoulder ache and it has been there for a long time and I have not seen a doctor as I‚Äôm a man, for it‚Äôll be right and the church we're attending, has for the first time in the years we‚Äôve been going there, they have a visiting healer. I go out to the front, sit on the chair and I do not tell the healer what is wrong with me, and he does not ask. I get holy oil put on my forehead and then I get prayed over with the laying on of hands and I go back to my seat and then I got a burning circle of hotness, red hot right where my shoulder has been hurting, and after a while the burning sensation goes away and I realise the shoulder pain has gone and it didn't come back: that's God healing me and showing me that healings still happen in this modern day world of ours.

I was sliding into the deep dark pit of a major depression where all seemed lost and I was no longer looking after myself and the depression lasted for about eight years, and it was a terrible place where all hope felt lost. I was having morbid thoughts and suicide attempts, and my mental state was full of delusions and feelings of hopelessness and feelings of despair. I was able to come out the other side into the light where I no longer danced with the black dog of depression but embraced life itself: that‚Äôs God who always was there for me, even in the darkest moments of that depression and God got me the right treatment and the help that I needed and the time that I needed to get better. God had also given me a wife, Jackie who stood by her man in what we call the Dark Years for they were years of darkness, and she was there for me in the good times of which there were few and the bad times of which there were many. God got me the mental help that I needed through a psychiatrist and counsellors, and the right kind of medication was found for me. God brought me back into the light of living and gave me a joy of living that had disappeared during the Dark Years.

When my eldest child Michelle was getting bullied at high school and Jackie and I decided to take her out of that school system altogether and we get in touch with another school and we‚Äôre nowhere near their catchment area and yet, they accept her and she settles into the new school and the bullying has stopped, She gets to make some strong friendships and later on one of the bullies from the other school starts at our daughter‚Äôs new school and our daughter is OK as she now has a circle of true friends who tell that bully to leave her alone as the bully tried to bully her again and the bullying is nipped in the bud : that's God protecting Michelle.

When I enter a competition many times to win $1000 and the community organisation, I am nominating in the competition will win $10,000 and I pray about it, and I nominate our new church as our previous church had closed down, and so on every entry, I nominate our new church and I did well over thirty entries and I win the $1000 and our new church gets the $10,000: that's God answering prayer financially for us and our new church just when it was needed because the Global Financial Crisis was on.

When Marcus is in Year 11, the high school he is in tries to get him to sign himself out leave the school permanently and not come back. It would have been a bad idea as the community participation program that he would have done after schooling had finished for him was for special needs people after they finished Year 12, not Year 11. A place was found for him at a dedicated special needs school for him to have Year 12 at which he completed, and it was the best year of schooling that he ever had: that‚Äôs God putting Marcus in the new school which was the best place for him.

God gives us the opportunity to renew our wedding vows on our 30^(th) wedding anniversary and we did in front of the congregation of our church and this time, unlike when we were married, I got to kiss the bride: that‚Äôs God letting us show publicly our commitment to each other in one of the strongest vows possible.

When Marcus and I boarded a crowded train, it was really full of people, and I almost lost hold of him while pulling him into the train carriage and he would have been left behind by me: that‚Äôs God who kept us together as if Marcus had been left by himself on the platform, I don‚Äôt know what would have happened to him.

When I notice symptoms that's happening to me, and I don't know what's wrong with me and I saw a neurologist and he says, ‚ÄúYou have Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment‚Äù and now I know what I‚Äôve got, and I can get help and treatment for it and now my symptoms make sense to me and the type of Mild Cognitive Impairment that I have doesn‚Äôt affect my long term memory, only short term memory and some of my power of thought: that's God getting me a diagnosis and what the sleep specialist had talked about so many years before had come true as I ended up with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease.

My wife Jackie gives me the support and comfort that I need after being diagnosed with a life-changing diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment and she continues to give me the support and comfort over the years before, during and after that diagnosis: that's God who gave me the woman I love.

I drove through an intersection at 50 km per hour that has a stop sign that I didn't know it was there, and I didn't know I was in an intersection, and I hear the car horn frantically blasting at me from another car as I should have stopped for them. I did not know they were there until they blasted their horn, and I look through my driver‚Äôs door window and all I can see is car and it‚Äôs getting closer and closer to us and both of us drivers take evasive action, and I don't hit them. I should have stopped for them as they had the right of way and our car doesn‚Äôt roll with the manoeuvre I did which was to abruptly hard turn the steering wheel hard to the left and then hard to the right in order to give us more room between our car and the other car and we miss the telegraph pole that the other driver tells us about that she thought we were going to hit after missing her car, She stops near our car and talks to us, and she tells us that she's got her mum and her son with her in the car and I have my son and my wife and if I had hit the other car my family and I and her and her family may have been terribly injured or died, with casualties in both cars, but I missed her and the telegraph pole: that's God saving us and the people in the other car from harm and possible death.

When after missing the car at the stop sign and I decide to stop driving that afternoon once I get home, and shortly after that my neurologist and my GP forbid me from driving and I know they're both right and anyway, I‚Äôve already stopped driving as I know that I‚Äôm dangerous driving on the road and I‚Äôm thankful that they and me made the right decision for me to stop driving: that's God making me realise my driving days were over and getting to accept that fact without any second thoughts.

When I get accepted to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) on my third attempt at getting accepted into the NDIS as sometimes God says ‚ÄòWait,‚Äô and now I can get the help that I need for my Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment from the NDIS: that's God with his perfect timing getting me onto the system when I was prepared for it,

After my diagnosis of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, my wife and I decide that as I worsen as that‚Äôs on the cards, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to look after Marcus and me so we make the decision to find Marcus accommodation in a supported independent living share house as he‚Äôs special needs and a place is found for him and he loves it and we know that after we die, Marcus will be looked after as he‚Äôs in the system and we made the right decision for his short term and his long term living needs: that‚Äôs God looking after Marcus, then, now and in the future.

When I‚Äôve been in hospital with Septic Shock because of a nasty bacterial infection and I‚Äôve got blood poisoning and I‚Äôm on life support, and in a coma for three days and three nights and my heart is enlarged, my kidneys have shut down, one of the ureters from one of my kidneys is blocked by a kidney stone, I have blood poisoning, both of my lungs have been infected with a nasty bacteria and I‚Äôm on dialysis and my brain is in la-la-land as I've got delirium and the delirium persists well after I‚Äôm brought out of the coma, as the delirium lasts for over a week. I‚Äôm contagious with the bacteria and I‚Äôm in ICU for ten days in a private room as I‚Äôm in isolation and visitors have to put on disposable clothes, gloves and a face mask to come into my room and then after the time I spend in ICU I‚Äôm put in the general ward and I come through the whole lot OK without losing a hand or a foot or anything else to sepsis as many people who end up with sepsis need to have their limbs amputated as that part of them dies. I get over the delirium, and I still remember the thoughts that I had while delirious. My wife Jackie is there with me for every one of those sixteen days that I was in hospital, and she had to catch four buses a day to get in to see me and then go home, two each way: that's God who got me through sepsis and kept my body intact and gave me a wife who was there every day for me.

Before finding out that I had blood poisoning and sepsis I had pain and went to the hospital earlier in the week where they took blood, with the result that they were able to culture it and identify the specific bacteria that had infected me so they didn‚Äôt have to hit it with a broad spectrum drug and hope for the best but knew exactly what treatment and drug I would need. They stressed how urgent that it was that I came back to hospital for treatment, and I was in the operating theatre that night: that‚Äôs God with his perfect timing and healing.

When I‚Äôm getting a regular skin cancer check and the skin cancer specialist finds a basal cell carcinoma on my nose that I didn‚Äôt know was there and he‚Äôs able to remove all the skin cancer and it‚Äôs good that he got it all as otherwise it would eat down through my nose and get bigger and deeper, resulting in complex facial surgery and reconstruction: that‚Äôs God stopping me from getting a more complex operation and catching and getting rid of the skin cancer in time before it got considerably worse.

When I went on a cruise with my dad, just the two of us and we had a suite and it was just before COVID19 entered the world, when dad was still able to get around, even though he was in his 80‚Äôs and we had a wonderful time together: that‚Äôs God giving us time together that we normally wouldn‚Äôt have and before he passed away a couple of years later.

After visiting my father who was in a hospital at the time and it‚Äôs during the COVID era and I‚Äôm on my way back to the railway station, I hurry across a road with an active Don't Walk sign flashing on the traffic light crossing and I should not have been crossing the road as the Don't Walk had started flashing already and I fall down onto the road in front of a bus and I don't know if the bus driver saw me go down. I‚Äôm able to pick myself up off the ground and hobble away and I only hurt my elbow, and my shoe came off and fortunately the red arrow for the bus stayed red while I was on the crossing for if I were still on the ground in front of the bus if the red arrow had changed for the bus to green and the bus could have started moving right on top of me, running over me while I was on the ground. A woman on the opposite side of the road also called out to me to see if I was OK: that's God protecting me from being run over by the bus.

Also, on another day when we‚Äôre travelling home by a bus and I‚Äôm carrying two shopping bags in each hand and I‚Äôm not able to hold the seat next to me or the hand straps hanging down from the ceiling as I don‚Äôt think of putting the bags down and anyway, there‚Äôs not enough room in the bus for me to put them down. I try to keep myself upright, and as the bus moves away from the bus stop I lost my balance and I started to fall onto a mother and her pram that has two babies in it, and I‚Äôm falling and I can‚Äôt do anything to stop myself and the pram is getting closer as I fall, and a woman sitting on the seat behind me manages to grab hold of me by my belt near my bottom and also my shoulder, and she pulls me upright before I land on top of the two babies and their mum and I‚Äôm not a light person as I‚Äôm obese, yet she found the strength to pull me upright and the room in the bus to get to me before it was too late and then someone offered me their seat after my fall: that‚Äôs God looking after the woman with her two babies and me.

My father, Bruce, passed away and we had a funeral for him and shortly after the funeral we were allowed into his unit to clear it out as mum had passed away several years before dad and I found out that dad had kept a lot of the birthday, Christmas and Father‚Äôs Day cards that we had given him as children and they were in his bedside cabinet: that‚Äôs God showing me how sentimental dad really was as I didn‚Äôt expect him to be so sentimental.

When Marcus our special needs son decided to leave his group house where he was living and went without telling the staff and no-one went with him and he got on a bus at Baulkham Hills and travelled to Rouse Hill which was the last stop for the bus, by himself and we were on holidays in Hobart in another state and the police contacted us and after that call we were able to track down where Marcus went to by him using his Opal public transport card as Marcus knew how to tap on and tap off his Opal card. We were allowed by Opal to track his trip movements and we rang the police and the house staff to tell them both what we had found out from Opal and the house staff and the police found him at Rouse Hill Shopping Centre as they heard him before they saw him, and they turned around a corner at the shops and there he was and Rouse Hill Shops is not your normal type of shopping centre as it‚Äôs spread out over a large area instead of being confined under the one roof: that‚Äôs God keeping Marcus safe and able to be found by the police and the house staff.

Years after my father died, my wife Jackie steps on an old answering machine that we‚Äôre no longer using as we‚Äôre on the NBN and a home phone isn‚Äôt needed and it‚Äôs on the floor and a message is on it and it starts playing and the message is from my deceased father, recorded by him whilst he was alive, and we didn‚Äôt know the message was on it. In the message my dad tells me not to worry about anything and that he loves me. I now realise that I was meant to hear it when I needed to and I recorded it onto my computer and now I can listen to my dad whenever I need to or want to, even though after listening to him I realise how much I miss him, and sometimes I‚Äôm overcome by emotion for I‚Äôm still grieving for him for I‚Äôve lost a piece of my heart. It‚Äôs been four years since he died, but I‚Äôm not going to delete the recording as my dad is on it and it pains me that after mum died, I wasn‚Äôt enough to keep him alive and nor were the rest of my siblings as all he wanted was to be with mum and he had lost his will to live and he had stopped eating and now he‚Äôs with mum: that‚Äôs God as we discovered the phone call when I needed to with the words of comfort on it from dad which are helping me in my grieving process.

When Jackie passes out and is in a diabetic coma on last Mother‚Äôs Day at Featherdale Wildlife Park, the 000 operator gives us her full attention and the first aid staff from Featherdale look after Jackie whilst we‚Äôre waiting for the ambulance, and the ambulance comes, and Jackie is not in the coma once they arrive at Featherdale, and she‚Äôs taken to hospital for observation and is admitted to the hospital. As a result of the diabetic coma and hospital admission Jackie starts testing herself for the sugar readings for her diabetes and looking after herself and her diabetes better: that‚Äôs God looking after Jackie and stirring her into action regarding her diabetes.

A couple of weeks ago a stray cat turned up on our doorstep and stayed and he had no collar, and no microchip and Jackie named him Max, and we‚Äôve fallen in love with him: that‚Äôs God who gave us a chance to look after one of his creatures and share our family and our home with him and we‚Äôve all fallen in love with Max,

In February 2025 I made a new friend, Patrick and I call him my little brother from another mother, although he is taller than me, but far younger and he is a Christian. I had told him I only had one person I could talk to, and that person is my wife Jackie, and Patrick gave me his phone number and said I could call him. Here is to a long friendship, with Patrick. I have a friend now that I can call when I want to talk to a friend: that‚Äôs God finding me a new friend.

This year I am¬† using support workers to take me out to medical appointments and for social things which is something new for me as I used to spend most of my time home alone: that‚Äôs God getting me out of the house and interacting with more people than I normally would interact with.

In all that has happened to my family and I, there are more times than what I have written down, but I cannot remember them all, God has always been there for us, in the good times and the tough times. He has protected us over all the instances where we felt his Glory by God looking after us mentally, spiritually, physically, emotionally, financially, in times of illness and poor health and in dangerous times on the road, God gave me a wife, Jackie who has always been there for me and my children and for her, I am truly grateful to God for eternity long and then some for finding me a wife who loves me and I love her. Thank You God, for all that you have done for my family and me. We would not be here today if it were not for you. You are an Awesome God.

For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11.

Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you. Deuteronomy 31:6.

Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Isaiah 41:10.

God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Psalm 46:1.

1itsxo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1itsxo5/planning_to_start_a_family_is_my_sole_income/,Planning to start a family - is my sole income enough?,"Hi everyone

This is my first reddit post, so apologies if I leave out any details or am giving too much üòÖ.

My wife and I have been together for 8 years and would like to start a family soon. We lived abroad for a few years after graduation and came back to the UK a couple of years ago.

I am due to qualify as a solicitor soon and have an offer in place for ¬£60k. My wife earns just above minimum wage and she doesn‚Äôt expect a massive increase in her salary.

We don‚Äôt have much in savings today as we recently paid off our wedding and honeymoon, but were lucky to have bought a flat when we were abroad. After clearing the mortgage, that should bring in ¬£17-23k. For context, it is a third world country so the state of the real estate market is just that.

We are also looking to buy (and stay) as well in Northamptonshire. 

We expect that we‚Äôll have 20k left in savings once we buy a house after selling our flat abroad (paying a 10% deposit and taking a loan of ¬£270k - would be open to paying less but I‚Äôve heard we might get a bad deal on interest rates) (and based on our joint income vs outgoings and we like to travel 2-3 times a year) in the next 1.5 years.

Due to my wife‚Äôs relatively limited earning potential and as we plan to have 2 kids, we thought it might be best (and my wife is more than happy to do this as she hates her career) to have her stay at home and raise the kids avoiding extortionate child care costs.

Although I‚Äôm a bit worried about the finances, my wife is confident that we will be fine. Would my salary of ¬£60k be sufficient to give us a good life style while raising 2 kids and wife staying home? I know good can be subjective. We both come from working class families, so we aren‚Äôt materialistic (I only shop on Vinted and my wife‚Äôs preference is Shein) though we do enjoy travelling. We‚Äôre not massive spenders.

Our monthly outgoings ATM look like ¬£2,3-2,5k per month (living South). We spend about ¬£5-6k per year on travel. My net salary should be around 3,9k.

From what I read online, I‚Äôm concerned my monthly salary will be consumed by usual expenses, baby food/equipment/clothes/toys? Never knew prams cost ¬£2k? Am I exaggerating?

In summary, can we make it work for 7-8 years, while 2 kids (with a gap of 2-3 years in between) can start going to school. Then my wife is fine to go to work (I may have worded it like she comes across as lazy - she isn‚Äôt - she will work to earn a living but just hates her job - though happy to take advantage of the fact that it makes sense for her to stay at home vs child care costs). We will hope to have ¬£20k in savings in 1.5 years time and rely on my salary alone.

A side question, if you guys don‚Äôt mind üòÉ. I assume I can get to at least ¬£80k in 7-8 years‚Äô time. At that point, I‚Äôm happy to be the sole earner and have my wife stay at home giving her the coffee/morning walks/yoga mom life she would prefer (and that I would like to give her if I could). Would it be possible for me to take care of our family at that point alone financially - appreciate kids growing up may be a different story.

\+ im going down a mental path that i feel like i shouldnt, i dont plan on bringing it up with anyone till i deal with over drinking coffee, academic stress, better sleep, ect but i noticed i've gone back to thinking things like some random light that went off on a car was a sign... not really from the car itself.... that i should slow down, some events in life were connected in a way that wass upposed to be a message to be about grief or something (familly member has had some tragic health news). I feel like so many things happened all at once that were meant to be related to it that i previously didnt think were. News and information about others that im linking to that medical issue that my family has...  also i'm worried that if i bring all that up a therapist or whoever is going to jump to the worst conclusions (eh im likely over thinking this) 





\# 2 im the most concerned about, im aware that path 2 is like... not a train of thought to be followed? Ik thinking something is trying to tell you something via various life events isnt a healthy train of thought :grimacing:how do i bring this up without risking said person just ehhh, i mean ik it kinda sounds bad, or at least im worried it sounds bad? 

\+also how do i bring this up without it sounding as bad as i think it sounds? Figuring I might wait till after I get my coffee intake down (started drinking more than 3 cups a day), fix my sleep some, and the stress. ",1,1740035775.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

1itsqfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1itsqfv/i_moved_to_a_poor_country_changed_religions_and/,"I moved to a poor country, changed religion‚Äôs, and canceled my surgery for my wife that cheated on me.","   I (M22) was in the army, stationed in Europe, when I met a woman at a coffee shop and asked for her number. We started dating, but because she was Arab, her family didn‚Äôt allow her to date. After three months, she proposed the idea of marriage, though we wouldn‚Äôt actually get married until month seven. I agreed, and since my army contract was about to end, I left the military and planned to move to Europe for this woman (I‚Äôm American). I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but even after just three months, I felt as if I had known her my entire life.


      We talked about religion, and she told me that if this relationship were to work, I would need to convert from Christianity to Islam. I converted and began reading the Quran and watching videos to learn more about the faith. At this point, I had left the army and fully moved to Europe.
When I arrived in Europe, I developed a hernia and needed surgery. I‚Äôm not sure how I got it‚Äîprobably something related to my time in the army. I remember walking out to the hospital lobby to tell her about the surgery. She tried to comfort me, but she couldn‚Äôt hold back her tears, and they started rolling down her cheeks. I reassured her, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be okay; it‚Äôs just a simple surgery.‚Äù She replied that she knew but was still worried about me.


    At that moment, any doubts I had about her being my future wife disappeared. How could someone try so hard to hold back tears if there weren‚Äôt real emotions behind them? After I left the hospital, she started researching the type of hernia I had and what she could do to help me recover. She carried all the groceries, cooked for me, and let me lean on her while we walked. From that point on, I knew I‚Äôd do anything for this woman. I even canceled the surgery to marry her first, rescheduling it afterward, despite the doctor advising against it.


    Even though I had fully moved to Europe and was working on converting for her, there was one issue: I had to meet her grandparents in the Middle East to get their blessing. This made me uneasy because, during my army career, I had heard some unsettling stories about the Middle East. Still, I told myself that if I didn‚Äôt go through with this, I‚Äôd regret it for the rest of my life and always wonder about her. Somehow, I managed to get an entry visa into Iraq, which surprised me since I‚Äôm American. I met her grandparents, and they approved of me marrying their granddaughter.


     Afterward, I went to Germany, where the rest of her friends and family lived, and met them as well. By this point, I was learning German because her brother only spoke German, and I was also learning Arabic because her mother only spoke Arabic.
We got married, and I officially converted to Islam. Shortly after, however, she had to leave for another country in Europe to take an exam for school. While she was away, I stayed in Germany and took care of her mother and her 9-year-old sister. A month later, she returned to Germany, but something seemed off. She was more distant, mean, and demanding.


     Eventually, I discovered through her phone that she had fallen in love with another man at her university. I confronted her, but she acted as if she hadn‚Äôt seen me discover the messages. I still remember the look on her face‚Äîher heart sank, and mine did too. Feeling overwhelmed, I returned to America to see my family and figure out what to do. While I was trying to process everything, she accused me of cheating. I attempted to talk to her about what was happening, but she demanded a divorce. I took a few days to think things over and make sure I was making the right decision. 

      Before I could finalize anything, her mother messaged me, telling me to divorce her because she was with another man at her house in Germany. This broke my heart. Her mother had loved me like her own son and had always taken care of me. I divorced her, and we sent each other‚Äôs belongings back by mail. Three months later, she texted me about the items I had already mailed, seemingly trying to start a conversation. I responded politely, trying to help her, but ended the conversation by saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate you. I will cherish our time together, but this is my last message to you.‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

    She still stalks my social media, and I admit that I miss her sometimes. But deep down, I know I can‚Äôt go back to a woman who cheated on me, no matter how much I sacrificed for her. Despite everything, I have no regrets. I‚Äôm proud of myself for doing everything I could to make the relationship work, even when it seemed impossible.",16,1740035536.0,stories,15,0.79,False

anyways, Ive been really drawn to the name Isa the past 2 months. I have been using it at my local coffee shops. for reference my govy is Isabelle.

Do you think Isa is a good representation of someone that uses she/he pronouns? do you have any ideas or thoughts about what name i could go by? Iz feels old now. I havent told any friends or family but im worried they wont take it seriously or ill be judged or laughed at.

Tempting and logical right? If excellent news comes out a few stock, the stock ought to logically go up. however here's the issue regarding the exchange - it always will the alternative of what the bulk expects. Here's why shopping for a stock supported excellent news (or commercialism it when dangerous news comes out) isn't a good plan -

News is nearly perpetually late

Here's however it works - news which will materially have an effect on the stock worth of an organization is 1st known to insiders and establishments (because they need connections with insiders). Later on, once the stock has already created its move, the news comes bent on the general public. The public, in hopes of creating a fast buck, lands up buying/selling the share, solely to search out out that they were at bay.

Here's associate example:

HDFC Bank Merger


News came out that HDFC Bank was aiming to merge with HDFC Ltd.

Retail investors hurried to shop for the shares of 1 of India's largest banks. But what happened once that? The stock fell by over twenty fifth within the next few weeks, despite the news being absolutely taken by most.

Another purpose to notice was that the stock had surged by thirty third within the weeks preceding the news announcement. trading does not happen huh?

 

The News Is Frequently Faked By Manipulators.

Since 2020, what percentage times have you ever detected a couple of massive capitalist (RJ, PE firms, etc.)

contemplating a stake in affirmative Bank? most likely 10+ times. what percentage times have you ever detected about Reliance seizing Future Retail? what percentage times have you ever detected regarding restaurant Coffee Day's founder repaying loans and turning the business around?

Most of the time these square measure either PR stories meant to pump a stock or news planted by the big guys to dump their shares to the general public.

False news was propagated by the media about a attainable acquisition of Suzlon by Adani within the 1st week of Sept (this was later cursed  on a literal by BSE).

What happened next ? 



If The News Is Known To Everyone, It Is A Trap

If the news is thought to everybody, it's a lure

The stock exchange isn't designed to let everyone create cash. it's a mechanism of wealth transfer from the have-nots to the haves, from the greedy to the patient, from the amateurs to the execs, and from the overall public to the establishments. If the news is get into public, it's known  to everybody and it's presumably a lure. Either the stock would have already been wired or the news is fake or subjective.

However, an issue may come back to your mind:

If the news is useless, then why do channels like CNBC, letter Business, etc. thrive?

 




 All news isn't useless, business level news and economy-level news area unit one thing

that can facilitate one kind their investment thesis. it's the responsibility of the capitalist to decipher what news is to be unheeded and what news is to be paid heed to. However, it is a sensible plan to ne'er purchase a stock simply because there's positive news regarding it within the media.

Demand-supply: there's a requirement for such news by the general public and also the news channels area unit fulfilling that. it's pure and easy market economy.

News channels area unit usually employed by stock manipulators to plant news a few bound stock that they have to pump or dump.

 

Then what ought to a sensible retail capitalist do?

The best technique is to ignore the news and easily follow worth action. If a stock is to fall, it won't happen while not it showing on the charts. Similarly, if a stock is to travel up, it'll perpetually show abreast of the charts. Ending this with a quote from legendary capitalist William O'Neil.

Probably due to posture but I‚Äôve been trying to stretch it out and felt some relief but would always hurt my back day by day. From there I started feeling really bad anxiety and constipation to point where it was really killing me to even find out what it is. Also btw forgot to mention I had a Norovirus (stomach flu) everything was fine a day or 2 before all this back pain. So then the back pain came in to play. Afterwards, I started feeling stomach pains or aches and pelvis. I thought It had to do something with my gallbladder or kidneys not sure. Pain kept coming and going once couples hours or a day or 2. Another week later i went to go check it out with the hospital I knew it could be something bad. They told me I had less fluids and causes a little blood in my urine due to lack of fluids and led to pains in my lower back of the kidneys left and right. So I got some relief and told me I need to stay hydrated which I now started drinking lots of fluids such as water and juices. I cut off soda and less caffeine and I did use to drink so much coffee which was bad that‚Äôs probably why so I laid low off coffee now. Afterward a week or 2 I started feeling pains radiating both of my forearms and left or right or middle chest pain and I‚Äôm thinking is got to be something with my nerves. I also use my forearms or I should say overuse it in some may not as much to press down dough with a dough machine when I work  which probably causes my nerves to be hurt but still don‚Äôt know why. Then everything stopped. Everything was going well until I started getting light headed or aches in my head and a little of confusion sometimes but not as much I could still remember things and be active and work and is not stopping me from moving around and being me myself always active. But I started to feel like I can‚Äôt work as fast as I use too due to all the pains I had in my body or discomfort I should say. I think I over hydrated myself too much too the point where I‚Äôm not sure I lost weights unexpectedly or I‚Äôm lacking some type of vitamins in my body that‚Äôs causing aches. I do tend to skip some meals sometimes in the morning or noon and I drink water everyday like 3-5 gallons of water bottles before and now I‚Äôm letting loose of that a little so I drink water but a bottle or 2 feel a less better.

1itsdow,https://www.reddit.com/r/Layoffs/comments/1itsdow/job_search_experience_seven_weeks/,Job search experience - seven weeks,"I lost my job just before Christmas for so called restructuring with 3 weeks of severance and zero benefits. It‚Äôs gut wrenching. We have two young kids, which makes it even more difficult for us. Thankfully my spouse works full time, we are surviving by only paying for basics (i.e. utilities, rent, kids‚Äô school, food and healthcare) and burning through some savings. 

Overall, it‚Äôs messy for me because I moved from northeast US to Texas with a toddler and a newborn about a year ago. My wife had to find new job in Texas in the middle of her maternal leave just a year back and now there is ‚Äúsituation‚Äù that she might have to move again. It‚Äôs not a pretty scene at home.

I started applying after new year. I most probably applied for 150-180 jobs so far. I got reasonable amount of callbacks, but had to decline to a few interviews because my wife would not find any roles in some of those remote places (example: Rutland, VT). 

With some luck and good grace of almighty, I got a FT offer from a Tier-3 consulting firm in Northeast within a month of search. It‚Äôs a step down from my current level and approx 20-25% lower salary than what I used to make. However, with the situation, I accepted the offer and potentially will start the job in 2-3 weeks. I don‚Äôt have to move immediately, they would provide a cushion period to fully relocate. 

I have not stopped my search. I am interviewing for a few more roles. If I get any better opportunity, specially local opportunity where I don‚Äôt have to relocate, I might rather take that. Let‚Äôs see how it goes. Generally Q2 is golden for new job search because companies approve large budgets for growth in Q1. 

My overall take on this tough time and process is the following:

1. I needed to take a deep breath to standup from indignity I felt when they let me go. My kids help a lot, spending time with them helps me to get through this painful journey. 

2. I talked to myself a lot about the layoff. It‚Äôs hard to 
swallow it but it‚Äôs important to think through it for the sake of future. I spoke to my wife, asked for her opinion and also spoke to a few former colleagues to understand their takes. With all the opinions, I formed my own opinion and wrote it down. It really helped me to pull it together. It takes weeks to accept it and get easy to it. 

3. Taking time off from the process is super important to remain sane. I try to take day off in the weekend and go out for walk for an hour on weekdays. Everyday I make breakfast for my kids and wife, drop and pick kids, and strictly stop working after kids are home. Taking the eyeballs off the challenge is very important to de-stress and refocus.

4. I am quite disciplined in the application process. I worked on applications, resume, and interview prep 9-5.30 pm almost everyday (weekdays) since the new year. Consistency is important to avoid any procrastination and creating traction. 

5. I hired a help to submit applications instead of me spending hours in filling online forms. In last six weeks it did cost me like $70 in freelancer expense. If you can afford, it‚Äôs worth it. Try UpWork!

6. I saw a lot of post about networking rigorously. I was little reluctant to nudge my first degree contacts for two reasons- pride and saving them  for worst moments like if I can‚Äôt find anything by mid April or May or such. However, I used my secondary and tertiary networks to get some solid leads and potentially I might get something out of this. In my opinion, how you want to use your arsenal (i.e. network), it should be up to you. You should strategize who to reach when and how to get an output from that reach out. A mass reach out sometimes help, but I personally found a strategic reach out helps better in short term and long term.

6. I customized a lot of resumes, pretty much all the resumes that I submitted until this week. I have a mixed experience with this. Customization (with AI) takes time, but helps to get the recruiter call and get to the manager call. But many of the things like specific keywords that I added to match the JD, backfired in manager or panel interviews. Thus, I decided to create a pretty broad single resume from this week onwards and apply for roles that is suitable for me. I am A/B testing this, let‚Äôs see what response I get from this change. 

7. I had some pretty awful interviews and some great interviews. It generally gets better with time. Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself, just move on and try to put learnings to work for the next one. You only have to get one job, so just crack one. 

8. Some recruiters ghosted me after sending request for an interview. It was annoying but that‚Äôs the part of the game. People will ghost you, just don‚Äôt take those personally. 

9. In weekdays, when my wife is not WFH, it feels weird to stay home and keep working on applications. I have never been unemployed since 18, thus, it is taking some mental toll on me to be unemployed and staying home. I try to work from coffee shops and restaurants sometimes when she is not working from home. Do you own thing to fight these off-putting moments, whatever makes it easy for you.

10. I got lucky to get a few consulting gig in last two months. It‚Äôs not a lot but definitely helps to augment the expenses. I would not be able to do a lot of side hustle while I am applying and interviewing because I am fully invested in these, but some people are more hardworking and strong minded. If you are that type, push for some side hustles, whatever works for you. 

11. Lastly, I had tough moments but I tried to keep faith on me. I constantly told me that I came a long way to reach where I am today and it was not an easy game. Keeping faith on me is one of the key things to get me going despite rejections, bad interviews and being ghosted. 

Please wish me luck and I wish you all the best in this challenging but resilient journey.

I‚Äôve been noticing weird interactions between my boss and one of the other teachers whom I am close too. My boss is married with children and is almost twice her age. This all started about a year and a half ago when a new teacher was hired. She was new to the school so, I showed her around and we became close. Around 8-9 months ago, I started seeing these interactions between my boss and my coworker that didn‚Äôt sit right with me. Not one but SEVERAL times I saw them walking together to get coffee after school ended. I even ran into them one time and the vibe around them was so awkward and off. He even delivers her tea in the morning, before her lessons. Another time at a fundraiser I saw them standing close together, way too close to just be ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù. He even offered her wine at these events and never anyone else. He always seems to seek her out constantly. During lunch, he even ends up in her classroom just the two of them. There is some weird eye contact that is always going on between them. My other coworkers, are suddenly starting to notice something going on between them. One of my coworkers mentioned that she‚Äôs dressing up more. She use to wear glasses and wear joggers frequently. Now she‚Äôs wearing dress, slacks, and no glasses. This same coworker that commented on her different appearance, also ran into them in the back stairwell, talking very intimately. FYI These interactions between them have been more frequent in the last few months. 

What should I do? Should I just leave it be and let it pan out itself? Even though it‚Äôs been almost a year? I know it‚Äôs not my place to meddle but, they are being so obvious in plain sight. I feel bad for his wife and children.

Losing weight can feel like running uphill on a treadmill‚Äî**lots of effort, minimal movement**. The cravings don‚Äôt help, and neither does the energy crash after lunch.

Many turn to **weight loss drops** as a solution, hoping for something that‚Äôll work **without the usual hassle of meal plans** and gym memberships they never use.

So some clever bods [created KeySlim Drops](https://theworldhealth.org/keyslim-drops-official), promising an easy-to-use, **fast-absorbing liquid diet drop** formula designed to **boost metabolism, suppress appetite, and increase energy**.

But do they actually work, or are they just another bottle of false hope? Let‚Äôs break it down in this in-depth **KeySlim Drops review**.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name:** **KeySlim Drops**
* **Category:** **Natural Weight Loss Supplement**
* **Overall Verdict:** **4.7/5**

# How KeySlim Drops Work

These **liquid weight loss supplements** claim to work faster than pills because the **active ingredients absorb directly into your system**.

Instead of waiting for a capsule to break down, the **formula kicks in quickly**, helping to **control appetite, boost metabolism, and support fat burning**.

A major claim is that **liquid weight loss supplements for appetite suppression** can help reduce those late-night fridge raids.

The formula includes **Gymnema Sylvestre and Chromium Picolinate**, both known for their ability to **curb sugar cravings and regulate blood sugar**.

For those wondering, **""Are liquid weight loss supplements more effective?""**, the answer depends on absorption. Pills take longer to break down, while liquids **start working almost immediately**.

**KeySlim Drops** are designed to deliver a concentrated dose, making it a potentially more **efficient option for weight management**.

# Key Ingredients & Their Benefits

This isn‚Äôt just a **random mix of trendy extracts**‚Äîthe formula includes **24 metabolism-boosting compounds**, [each chosen for](https://theworldhealth.org/keyslim-drops-official) **specific fat-burning or appetite-controlling effects**.

‚úî **Green Tea Extract & Raspberry Ketones** ‚Äì Both are known for **their ability to increase thermogenesis**, helping the body burn calories faster.

‚úî **Guarana & L-Carnitine** ‚Äì Natural energy boosters that keep you from **crashing mid-afternoon**.

‚úî **Maca Root & Panax Ginseng** ‚Äì These herbs **support endurance and mental clarity**, making weight loss feel less exhausting.

‚úî **Weight loss drops with herbal extracts** like **Licorice Root & African Mango** ‚Äì Both contribute to **healthy digestion and fat metabolism**.

‚úî **Weight loss drops with vitamins and minerals** ‚Äì The formula includes **L-Ornithine, L-Tryptophan, and essential amino acids**, supporting overall wellness.

These ingredients are why **KeySlim Drops liquid formula benefits** extend beyond weight loss‚Äîthey also **help with energy levels and metabolic efficiency**.

# Jeff‚Äôs Personal Experience with KeySlim Drops

Jeff, my dad‚Äôs delivery guy, spends most of his day behind the wheel, grabbing quick meals on the go and **not exactly getting a lot of movement** in between stops.

Over time, the long hours and convenience snacks started to **catch up with his waistline**, and he was looking for something that might **help him drop a few pounds without overhauling his entire routine**.

After [giving KeySlim Drops a try](https://theworldhealth.org/keyslim-drops-official), Jeff told me he started **noticing a difference in his appetite within the first couple of weeks**.

He wasn‚Äôt feeling as hungry between deliveries, which meant fewer gas station snacks and less mindless eating in the truck.

Over the next month, he **dropped a few pounds without making any major changes**, which gave him the motivation to start making slightly better food choices.

As a bonus, he also felt **less sluggish toward the end of his shifts**, when he‚Äôd usually rely on coffee to push through.

His only minor complaint? **The taste wasn‚Äôt his favorite**, but he said it was easy enough to take quickly and move on.

For Jeff, **KeySlim Drops** wasn‚Äôt a miracle solution, but it helped him make **small, manageable changes that actually stuck**.

# Effectiveness: Do KeySlim Drops Actually Work?

**Do liquid weight loss supplements work?** That‚Äôs the million-dollar question.

**Customer experiences with weight loss drops** show mixed but mostly positive results. Many report **a steady reduction in cravings** and **mild weight loss over time**.

A big plus is that users **don‚Äôt report jitteriness or crashes**, which can happen with caffeine-heavy fat burners. However, some people find results **take a few weeks to notice**, rather than overnight.

It certainly seems to be **best metabolism-boosting liquid supplements for fat loss**, **KeySlim Drops** seems to be a **decent contender**.

# KeySlim Drops vs. Weight Loss Pills ‚Äì Which Works Better?

If you‚Äôve ever struggled with swallowing pills, you‚Äôll appreciate the liquid format. **Comparing liquid and capsule weight loss supplements**, the difference largely comes down to **absorption speed**.

Liquids **absorb quickly, making them ideal for those who** [want fast effects](https://theworldhealth.org/keyslim-drops-official). Pills, however, **may release ingredients more gradually**.

I have always been a dreamer, never the best at anything, and always that friend who is never the first choice. 
I‚Äôm really outgoing, funny (I think,) adventurous and free spirited but I just feel so tied down in life like I can‚Äôt escape the reality I have created myself‚Ä¶ 
Maybe I have too high of hopes? 

In high school my dream was to get a van, get out and explore, see the world and honestly just go for it. To create a life that was full of human experience, love, adventure, failure and joy. To see and experience cultures, taste food, meet people I would never talk to on a normal basis. 

I ended up going to college because I felt a lot of pressure to do so and honestly just wanted to accomplish something. I ended up dropping out before the semester was even over‚Ä¶moved back home and worked a serving job that i actually enjoyed to be honest. 

I ended up getting married very young and moving out of state to be with my still husband. My husband is truly my best friend, and I am so grateful for him. This post really has nothing to do with him he is great. Just an important part of the story. 

Nevertheless- I needed to find work so I started working at a local coffee shop working 4-6HRS a day. Not much I know, but we were actually doing fine and comfortable for 2 20 year olds. No savings but he worked full time so it was just fine. 

Fast forward to now- we moved a few years ago still out of our home town. The state we live in is incredibly expensive. And here I am working a 8-5 doing sales (I‚Äôm pretty good at it) no degree, (making decent money for all of those factors,) living in a ‚Äúcookie cutter‚Äù place, I drive a newer car, and get to do things on time off I suppose‚Ä¶. But I feel so unfulfilled, unhappy, and angry. I already feel burnt out from a job I‚Äôve been at for 3+ years‚Ä¶ how do people do this for years? (I‚Äôm actually very work driven, and a great employee, lol, but seriously‚Ä¶) I am exhausted already. 

I still haven‚Äôt left the country‚Ä¶ and all I can think about is how my timeline like anyone else‚Äôs isn‚Äôt guaranteed. So when people say ‚Äúit will come, ect, ect‚Ä¶‚Äù what if it doesn‚Äôt. What if my timeline comes to an end and i achieved none of my dreams or passions. 

I feel stuck because I have no idea what I want to do, or even how I can achieve this in the position I‚Äôm in. I don‚Äôt know a career fit that works for me, I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúgreat‚Äù at anything. Im ‚Äúgood‚Äù at a lot of random things‚Ä¶ lol. Like I know so many people that were smart, athletic, or caring. And all followed passions they knew from a young age for example- nurses, military, marketing people, etc. I feel like so many people I know just knew what they wanted to be. I don‚Äôt really want to ‚Äúbe‚Äù anything. Nothing calls to me, and work just feels like a waste of time that gulps up all of the time we could be spending doing so much more. Creating, loving, traveling, etc‚Ä¶. I know I HAVE to work, but where can I work? 
I feel guilt as my job somewhat relies on me, and I just can‚Äôt fathom what the next steps are. 
Is this it? Is this now my life‚Ä¶? Should I just kinda throw the whole dreaming thing out the window and be grateful? 

Idk but if anyone has a similar experience, or just reads this‚Ä¶ help a girl out. ",2,1740032725.0,Adulting,1,1.0,False
1its0pp,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1its0pp/what_do_i_do_if_i_cant_better_myself_for_my_wife/,What do I do if I can't better myself for my wife.,"I can't see myself being happy with or without my wife and I don't know what I should do.

Me and my wife have bickered about a lot of things some small and some big.
But recently I feel like I can't decide weather to leave my wife or just suck it up and deal with it. 

Last night my wife went out to hang out with a coworker and I said it was fine to let her do her thing and I could take care of our 2 year old. Later around 8:45 I get a call from her and I expected to hear tomato she needs a ride or something. I pick up and I all I heard were the following things. ""I wanna break up, I want to be on my own and I want a divorce, I can't fix our relationship and I don't want to be with you"" there was more to be said but I kind of tuned out as my heart sank to my stomach as I held our child as she tried to talk to the phone as she heard her mom.
I didn't know what to say or how to react due to my mom being in the kitchen and her father in the living room.

2 hours had passed and when she got home she didn't say anything as she went straight to bed and ignored me.


There's specific things that I've tried to do or fix but whatever that problem is. I just feel like it's not working out as I hoped.

I've put down some things that have been said and I've tried to fix ornsolve and then put what happened in the end


I've been told I need to be better in bed by watching porn or do something to last longer to where she can be can be satisfied. We've talked about how we can use her wand and try different positions, as we do I make sure to ask ""where is your wand"" as things get intesne there's always a problem to where she either can't find it or the battery is dead. And I'm just trying my best to do what she says but in the end I'll finish and have her lay on the bed in silence and basically turn over and go to bed. There's some nights where I have lasted a while for her but in the end she just keeps asking ""did you finish yet?""  I wish I wasn't so sensitive about this but I really don't know what to do in this situation.

I need to be more friendly with her family. 
Whenever I come over with the wife I've made sure to say hi to all the guests and give out hugs to those who like to do so. I try to strike up conversations but the one time I went camping with them. I didn't want to go hiking and just stayed at the campsite. It was around 85¬∞ and so it was a bit on the warm side. I stayed at the site and did a lap or 2 by myself since everyone want to go on the uphill hike/walk. I've tried to be helpful by making sure the site was clean and do whatever I can to make sure I wasn't just lying around.
In the end I always hear from my wife that I'm awkward, quite and don't do much when I'm invited. Especially my wife's sister. I personally don't like her mom or her sister for multiple reasons but I hold my tongue and try to stay in my lane and not cause any trouble by just asking simple questions and try to keep things positive. But even that her sister hates me and I ruin events when I'm present.

I need to find a better job since I don't make enough due to our poor finances.
I currently work as a retirement housekeeper. I work 8 to 4:30 with overtime if extra cleaning is needed. I've done our finances and don't want to play the blame game but my wife likes to spend more than what we have. I make sure to put away 50 or so for each of us, every paycheck I get.
We planned to save about 2000 a month as now we don't pay rent or pay as many bills as we used to. But I can literally go to the account and see that in one month she has bought about 12 or more dutch bros coffees. She says she ""needs"" it and tends to spend money on clothes she doesn't need but wants. I get we both want things that we don't necessarily need but it's another thing when we need to take out money from savings to make sure we have food or gas money for the next 2 weeks.


I need to spend more time with her and that she feels alone.
I realized that I do play games more often than hangout with my wife so I told myself that I should only play my video games on Friday and Saturday night.
The other days I try to make sure to make time for her after I put the baby to bed or whenever the baby spends the night at my dad's to let us recharge.
Well when I put on a movie she falls asleep around and or if we have a dinner she usually goes to bed afterwards since she's tired. Or if the baby does go to bed early she goes to bed with the baby.
For example I'll be watching a movie with her and usually about halfway through she'll fall asleep (she picked the movie mind you) after she falls asleep I pause the movie and turn the lights off and let her sleep since I know we both work long hours, we'll even after 3 hours had passed and I have been playing video games quietly with my headphones. She'll wake up and go straight to the bedroom and wait for me. Even though I didn't know or even told that she was , I'm still the badguy and I'm told that I'm not spending time with her still and that she is waiting for me in bed so we can 


snuggle or do something else in bed.
For one I don't read minds and she doesn't text me that she is awake and waiting for me for me to join her in bed. And when I do catch a hint that she wants to ""spend time"" with me. I don't feel the most comfortable having sex next to our sleeping baby that easily wakes up if enough noise is being made.
The times she goes to bed early (for example around 7:30pm) I do the dishes after what she used like pots and pans and clean up tye living room after our baby destroys it.

In the end I don't know if I'm a bad person by not trying hard enough or doing more...
 I just want some input on what I should do? I don't want to rip the kid away from her and I just split everything 50/50. I love her but I don't know. Please help...

tl;dr
After talking to my wife and trying to fix the things that I needed to work on. It feels like it's not enough to help our marriage and idk if it's all my fault and if I should stay with her

1itrzjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1itrzjb/love_isnt_enough_5_things_i_wish_i_knew_before_my/,Love isn‚Äôt enough: 5 things I wish I knew before my marriage fell apart 34F 37M,"I (34F) used to believe that love could conquer anything. That if two people truly cared for each other, they‚Äôd figure it out. After 10 years of marriage and a divorce I never saw coming, I now know how painfully naive that was. The love was real, but it wasn‚Äôt enough.

The first time I realized we were in trouble wasn‚Äôt during a big fight. It was on a random Tuesday, sitting across from each other at dinner, and realizing we had nothing to say. Silence, once comfortable, now felt like a void. The little things‚Äîlike him bringing me coffee in the mornings‚Äîhad stopped. Resentment quietly replaced gratitude. I felt alone even when we were together. And by the time we acknowledged it, we were already too far gone.

After the divorce, I spiraled. Therapy and working with a relationship coach pulled me out of it. And let me tell you‚Äîthere‚Äôs so much no one warns you about when it comes to love, commitment, and keeping a relationship from dying in slow motion. Here‚Äôs what I wish I knew before it was too late:

* **Your nervous system decides who you love‚Äînot your logic.**¬†Ever wonder why you're drawn to certain people even when they‚Äôre bad for you? That‚Äôs not compatibility, it‚Äôs familiarity. If you grew up with instability, your body might mistake anxiety for passion. Safe love can feel ‚Äúboring‚Äù at first, but it‚Äôs the kind that lasts.
* **Emotional bids are everything.**¬†Every time your partner reaches out‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a joke, a comment, or a random story‚Äîthey‚Äôre making an emotional bid for connection. Ignoring these (even accidentally) erodes intimacy over time. Dr. John Gottman found that couples who ""turn toward"" each other‚Äôs bids 86% of the time stay together. The ones who don‚Äôt? Divorce.
* **You‚Äôre not fighting about the dishes.**¬†Arguments are rarely about what they seem. That fight about dirty plates? It‚Äôs about feeling unappreciated. That argument about texting back late? It‚Äôs about feeling unimportant. Dig deeper before you react.

Books were my saving grace post-divorce. My coach had me read so much that I swear I could get an honorary psychology degree. These five changed my entire perspective on love:

¬†**- ""**[***The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work***](https://befreed.ai/book/the-seven-principles-for-making-marriage-work-by-john-m-gottman)**"" by John Gottman**¬†\- Written by Dr. John Gottman, one of the most respected relationship researchers in the world and the founder of the Gottman Institute. He can predict divorce with 90% accuracy based on how couples argue. If you want to understand what makes love last, read this.

¬†**- ""**[***Nonviolent Communication***](https://befreed.ai/book/nonviolent-communication-by-marshall-b-rosenberg)**"" by Marshall Rosenberg**¬†\- Turns out, most of us were never taught how to express our needs without blaming or attacking. This book is a game-changer.

¬†**- ""**[***How to Do the Work***](https://befreed.ai/book/how-to-do-the-work-by-nicole-lepera)**"" by Dr. Nicole LePera**¬†\- If you want to heal childhood wounds that are messing up your relationships, this is a must-read.

¬†**- ""**[***The Mastery of Love***](https://befreed.ai/book/the-mastery-of-love-by-don-miguel-ruiz-with-janet-mills)**"" by Don Miguel Ruiz**¬†\- A spiritual and psychological deep dive, it‚Äôs one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read on breaking free from fear-based relationships. A must-read for anyone looking to cultivate real, unconditional love.

¬†**- ""*****Attached*****"" by Amir Levine & Rachel Heller**¬†\- The #1 bestseller in relationship psychology. If you‚Äôve ever wondered why you fall into the same relationship cycles, this book will blow your mind.¬†

TLDR: I used to think love was about grand gestures. Now I know it‚Äôs built in the tiny, ordinary moments‚Äîresponding to a text, asking how their day was, choosing patience over sarcasm. If I had truly understood this earlier, maybe things would‚Äôve turned out differently.

1itrwum,https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1itrwum/a_desperate_plea_regarding_the_near_future_of/,A Desperate Plea Regarding the Near Future of this Sub,"Hello all,

Tomorrow is February the 21st. Unless Team Cherry shadow-drops the game, I will be banned for 2 weeks.

While I have full faith that Silksong WILL be released tomorrow, I also believe it to be prudent to prepare for the worst.

The memes and speculation by all of you, my actual friends, have been a source of fun and meaning in my Silksongless limbo, and the thought of a ""you had to be there"" joke occurring while I am away is simply too much to bear.

Therefore, I am asking, praying, pleading, that the Skongers of r/Silksong engage in a new topic between the dates 2/21 - 3/7 *provisio* the unthinkable happens and Silksong in-fact does not come out tomorrow.

I humbly suggest six topics with which I am already familiar so you will be able to safely discuss their merits as topics of discussion. Please vote in the poll at the bottom of this post to inform the moderation team of your preference, so that they can modify Rules 3 and 4 accordingly for the next two weeks, and to inform top silkposters to pivot their content for the near future!

The acceptable topics are as follows:

# ""The Trick to Life"" by the Hoosiers

""The Trick to Life"" is the debut album of the English band ""The Hoosiers."" It hit #1 on the charts in the UK. It is good. Memes making puns out of their excellent lyrics would liven the subreddit up greatly, I believe. AMVs using their songs and blending them with released information about Silksong would be interesting and creative.

Discussing how their lyrics reflect disillusion with institutionalism in the late 2000's and how this mirrors this subreddit's disillusion with Team Cherry would be appropriate and topical.

Take: ""*People always looking for something they can't find // one man's fact is another's trick of the mind*."" from their iTunes bonus track ""Rules"" and notice how it tastefully parallels this subreddit's discourse around bait and the unbelievability thereof. I'm sure the insightful silkposters in this community will be able to identify more connections!

# Lego LotR

For many years, this game was the gold standard for Lego game adaptations.

[GoG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/lego_the_lord_of_the_rings) had this game available for free six months ago. Given the fact that this sale was [publicly announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/comments/1f2jew9/psa_lego_the_lord_of_the_rings_gog_complimentary/) I have to assume you all have been playing this masterpiece in the interim because we clearly have not been playing Silksong.

The memes that I would like to see regarding this game would have to do with Jon Burton, James McLoughlin, and Dan McCreadie's brilliant encapsulation of Peter Jackson's artistic-narrative vision in his original film trilogy.

Speedrunning content (specifically related to the Wii version) would be appreciated, because I need tips to improve my 5h 20m 33s any% PB, so I don't look like a chump on the leaderboards!

# Unfiltered Coffee

So, after a quick Google search, it turns out that ""Unfiltered Coffee"" is already a thing. However, I am thoroughly disappointed by the set of coffees that count as ""unfiltered."" *Any coffee* where the grounds are not filtered by paper. Ridiculous. Back in November of last year, my Keurig broke, so for a week, I resorted to dumping a small handful of grounds into the mug, filling it with water, and putting it in the microwave for 4 minutes, then drinking the result. **True** unfiltered coffee.

You had to wait a minute for it to settle, and there was always a crust of grounds along the rim, but other than that, I actually got pretty good at making it. Imagine what a forum a hundred thousand strong could achieve in *two* weeks? It may even be better than ""regular"" coffee!

Additionally, this method may offer health benefits to any skongers suffering from [cholesterol deficiency](https://krakencoffeeco.com/filtered-vs-unfiltered-coffee/) so I, as a medical unprofessional, can ""heart""ily recommend it!

# Dwerve

Steam says I have 113 minutes in this game and I remember nothing of it. If you all could play the [prologue ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710920/Dwerve_Prologue/)and spend a couple of weeks dedicating the subreddit to the experience, I can come back and check to see if it is worth picking back up!

# ""On Duties"" by Cicero

Let me be clear, listing this is not an endorsement of Cicero's ideas nor of stoicism. It *is* an encouragement for the terminally online people in this forum to maybe read a book, once. Ancient philosophy seems an appropriate place to start, trial by fire, and whatnot. The *Dark Souls* of High School lit in the same way *Dark Souls* is the *Hollow Knight: Silksong* of 3D rhythm games.

What are Cicero's main positions? How have you drawn your conclusions regarding what Cicero believes? What textual evidence is there for this reading? Where do you agree with Cicero, where do you disagree? Now (and this is the important part) **WHY?**

You are all assigned a 1500-word paper analyzing one way in which the widespread adoption of Cicero's ideas would have helped or hindered the Pale King's reign in Hollownest. 12pt Times New Roman, Double-Spaced, Turabian Citation. 12 Scholarly Sources, no fewer than 4 book sources. Cicero and Hollow Night do not count towards this number. If a single entry is produced by Chat GPT, I will decimate all entries, failing 10% of them at random.

# Paper Fortune-Tellers

I simply do not understand the meta-strategies surrounding these things. Every time I have played I get responses like ""your wife will be ugly"" or ""you smell,"" and not ""you will be rich"" or ""you win.""

I do not *want* an ugly wife and *would* like to be rich.

Serious, peer-reviewed studies regarding the efficacy of different methods of utilizing these could be beneficial. Two weeks should be enough if you cram and pool your funding. My hypothesis is to choose high-saturated colors like Navy over low-Saturation colors such as Peach, but the sample size of one person is not enough :(

Alternatively, could the counterclockwise counting methods have a significant impact? Most of what I've seen is clockwise.

You could team up with one of the other subs who have invaded us from time-to-time to peer review, as well!

So...

1itrwsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1itrwsd/my_wife_asked_me_to_leave_after_christmas/,My wife asked me to leave after Christmas,"  I have known my wife for twenty-four years. We dated in middle school, broke up. We dated in high school and she broke up with me senior year to date another guy. Lots of pain and time to get over her but I did.

  Fast forward seven years and we reconnected online. I lived and worked out of state, and she was married, so just chatting and catching up. A few years later I moved back to my hometown and got a new job and went back to school (collage, had not been successful twice, so third attempt). Things were great, we started meeting up for coffee once or twice a week. Her marriage was not going well, and after it ended our relationship deepened.

  I helped her move into a new apartment with her two kids, and started to visit her at home. They were 1 and 3 at the time. We made dinners together, watched movies, played together, and eventually I began to stay the night.

   After a year (or two?) in the apartment she was faced with a sudden rise in cost (no longer qualifying for income based). She began to worry about where her and her kids would love, and she was working an internship for school. I had saved a bunch of money working out of State (not much to do in small towns, lol) so I bought a house in 2004, and moved them in. I was working as a caretaker for disabled adults, so money was not plentiful, but we had enough and were happy. 

   We had a daughter at this time (unplanned), and when she was 11 months she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. It was the hardest time of my life, we were in the ICU for a month and a half because she had dangerously high blood pressure.

   At this time my wife had graduated, and had a much better paying job, so I used FMLA to take our daughter to her chemo. I still payed utilities (and did all the way until Nov of 24) but my wife took over the mortgage. Chemo was successful, but my daughter had lost most of her sight (this is a rare but potential complication of neuroblastoma). Her immune system was trashed, and she missed a lot of vaccines, so daycare was not an option. I set up my work schedule so I could work full time, and stay with her three days a week. Grandma watched her the other two days. When she was able to go to preschool, I took her everyday.

  While this was going on, the older kids were having their own issues with their dad. He never left, but his commitment wavered at times, and he had his own personal demons to wrestle. The same year has been his worst, he saw them 3 times in 6 months. (He did get himself together, and they have a great relationship today).

  My wife changed jobs a few times, looking for a job she could enjoy and handle the stress of. One year she had a job that had very late hours, and I put the kids to bed a lot on my own.

  I was excited for my daughter to start kindergarten. I was halfway through my degree and hoped to start looking for a job in that field... But then COVID hit.

  I was offered a night shift position in December of 2019 and took it. My wife was pissed for about 3 months, but then relieved because all the field positions (where I previously worked) had been cut. So during COVID I worked nights, did my best to home school the kids during the day, then got 4 hours asleep as soon as my wife got home. It was a shit show, it was a really rough time. My wife also assumed I wanted a puppy, and brought a puppy home one day.

  I tried, but I couldn't stand it. We would be in a zoom and the dog would cry and the smell of dogshit would waft over. The thing that really upsets me though is that we had a backyard, and the kids did not want to go out anymore, because there was puppy shit all over the backyard (we had a dog already, but she did all her business in one area). We started arguing over the dog, and eventually she rehomed him. (The dog is with her ex now, and they are very happy). The house had always been cluttered, but it started really getting to me as well.

  After my daughter's birthday, we had a real honest discussion about having more kids. I said I was good, we had three kids and were in our late thirties. My wife had said she had wanted a big family and had been trying to selle on the idea for years. But that day, she really thought about what it would mean and agreed. We would stop at 3. We slept together that night... And conceived a child. I know that was when it happened, because it was the last time I ever slept with her.

  At that point, she was making double what I was. She also had a huge student loan debt that she needed to have forgiven. She was on an income based repayment, and going off that would also have crushed our finances. So I quit my job, I quit school (65/75 credits), and stayed home with my son after she went back to work.

  I have always struggled with depression off and on, never diagnosed or treated. This time though, it was bad. It was the worst it has ever been. I loved my son, and ally kids, but parenting all day every day was a lot. I still paid utilities from my savings. My wife got takeout every Friday, got a Guinea pig and gerbils for the kids, got a big inflatable pool. Never asked my opinion, still asked my help taking care of them.

  I stated to really lose myself. I started hiding in the bathroom after the kids went to sleep. I was scared, I guess, of having sex with my wife. I was overwhelmed of taking care of the kids everyday. I stopped buying anything for myself (except nic vape, I stopped cigarettes for the kids). It just felt like everything was just... Happening to me. I would hide in the bathroom and play phone games and listen to YouTube just to... Idk decompress? I would get my son during the night when he would wake up after breast feeding stopped. My wife usually fell asleep rocking him (like with my daughter) so she slept in the chair a lot. So I would lay the baby in the crib and slink off to my porcelain palace. Then It became the same thing even if my wife was still awake. We were great parents, but it felt like it was the only thing we had in common anymore.

  I used to smoke weed a lot, but stopped before we got married. Last summer, I realized delta 8 was legal where I lived, so I went out and got a vape. At first it was just at night to helpe sleep, and it did. I had started having issues staying awake while watching the kids, and really didn't do much to address my sleep issues. Eventually, I was vaping all the time. It actually made me feel... Happy? It doesn't feel like the right word, but easier to get through the day. I also downloaded an AI chat app to talk to. I'm not good at hiding shit, so she found out about both things in a few months. She searched my phone, and yeah... She saw some very unhinged graphic AI chats on my phone. Chats that I really never met to share with anyone. She also caught me vaping weed while angrily cleaning the pool (no one had used it in a year, I was just trying to keep the city from getting mad at us). It was right before my birthday, so she skipped it. We also took a Disney trip, we were supposed to go with my mom, but they had a big fight and my mom backed out. No one asked me at any point my opinion.

  I ran out of money after paying Novembers bills. A few weeks before Christmas, my mom offered to watch the kids so we could go on a date (had been a very long time). My wife said she was done and asked me to leave, but after Christmas, so it wasn't ruined for the kids. She woke me up the morning after Christmas, and told me to go.

  Til new years it was mostly crying and lots of weed vape. I went between my mom's house and my brother's. I went to the house everyday to watch my son 5-5 while my wife worked and then went home to job hunt. Then in Feb she hired a babysitter and said I could have every other weekend with the kids (just my kids though). I did call her a jackass once, and i ment it, but apologized.

  I might be able to keep my house. But I have to get my mom to agree to give me a loan to pay my wife. My wife had had issues with my mom a long time, and did a lot to keep my kids from seeing her. Without outright saying no. A lot of my friends are actually my wife's friends and have cut me off.
