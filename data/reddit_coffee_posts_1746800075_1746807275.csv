We met my first year in school I was in foster care. And he was the sweetest ever, I have fond memories of our time together. Pond graduation he went off to the Navy we wrote one another often and had plans to elope so that I could go and be with him wherever he was stationed, but life happened and things just‚Ä¶..ended. 
we keep cycling back into one another‚Äôs orbit. Every few years we have connected for coffee or a chat but both going different directions. 
Recently though we are both in a position where more than coffee has occurred. He shared he kept my letters and pictures for a long time but they ended up being burnt due to his ex wife not being fond of him having those tokens of his past. He‚Äôs told me he always felt like I was the one that got away and that he‚Äôs often searched me out in other women he‚Äôs dated. 
He told me he‚Äôs not willing to let me go again. 

The difference with him is he always saw me for me, and I always saw him as a very gentle and loving man even as teens. I was an emotional roller coaster trying to heal from past traumas and he never saw me for any of that. 

I‚Äôve had my share of relationships all being abusive in some ways or another and left one that resulted in safety planning because of this I‚Äôve expressed that I don‚Äôt want to just dive head first into anything. 

He shared that he wanted to save me when we were younger that he could see what o was going through and wanted to be that anchor for me. 
And now it seems he‚Äôs trying to do that. 

He‚Äôs expressed the desire to purchase a home and place it in a trust for my kids and I as living beneficiaries. He said he wants nothing from it just to know the kids and I are okay. He said he wants to make sure that we are secure and have something nobody can take away. He speaks of moving forward in life with me. 
But‚Ä¶I‚Äôm terrified. 

I have a record of clearly not seeing the red flags with last partners and end up hurt in the end. This last one took everything from me financially and emotionally. And left me really unable to trust my decision making. And unable to trust anyone around me. 

I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs learning these things about me to later use against me to hurt me. He soft, he‚Äôs kind, he‚Äôs so very gentle.  But so was everyone else in the beginning. 

I‚Äôm in therapy full time and have been off and on over the years as I struggle with Cptsd and BPD.  Something he knows about. He too is in therapy.

What is the grind size for an aeropress + lodhi from devans. Also, whats a good ratio to use for the coffee?    
  
2. I am going for hoffmanns aeropress recipe to start with. Any other recipe that anyone would recommend aside from the inverted method? 

3. Any similar coffee recommendations to try with this new setup?

4. Finally, I want to try a fresh grind with my french press as well - what would be ratio and grind size for it?

Side Note. I feel like the post apocalyptic US would be woefully short on coffee and the #1 priority and time consuming activity of most people would be growing and sustaining some food sources, not forming cults of personality, nobody got time for that!

The still air fell silently over me as my eyes slowly adjusted to the pitch-black darkness. That was the first sign that something was wrong. It was rarely this dark in my room. Usually, some light would be glowing. My clock and nightlight were dead, and there were no lights on in the hallway either, so I figured something might be happening with the power.

I couldn't remember what exactly woke me up. I vaguely remember my dream, but I remember waking up to a loud bang behind me‚Ä¶ somewhere. I slowly rose out of bed, still dressed in my clothes from yesterday. I must have passed out on the couch, and Dad tucked me in. 

Speaking of Dad, where was he? Surely he must have heard that noise. I slowly navigated my way through the dark room, feeling my way around and occasionally almost tripping over something on the floor. I managed to reach the door and make my way out of my room.

The house was almost pitch black, and no light was coming from the windows either. The power outage was larger than just our house. I felt my way across the wall, finding a light switch. Predictably, nothing turned on when I flipped it. What was going on?

""Dad? Are you awake?"" I asked. I entered the living room, looking for a light. I bumped into the coffee table, falling onto the couch with a thud. I groaned, getting back up. I stumbled upon a drawer, opened it, and found a flashlight. Turning it on and letting my eyes adjust to the sudden change in brightness, I looked around the house. 

The house seemed fine, with nothing broken. However, it was dead quiet‚Äînot even the sounds of crickets or insects. I walked down the hallway and opened the door to Dad's room. 

""Dad?"" I asked as I opened the door. To my surprise, Dad wasn't in bed or the house. Had he left? Why would he leave, especially at this hour? He must be outside somewhere. 

Suddenly, I heard a loud scratching noise, followed by a bark. I looked towards the front door, seeing Sadie clawing at it. She was barking and whining at me to let her inside. I walked down to the entrance and opened the door. As soon as I did, Sadie ran into the house towards my bedroom.

""Sadie! What are you doing, girl? Come back here!"" I said as I ran after her. I found her in my bedroom, crawling under my bed. What was Sadie doing? She never acts like this. I turned around to walk back outside to find Mrs Saddler to help get Sadie back to her house. 

Outside, the stars were much brighter due to the apparent lack of power. For as far as I could see, there were no lights on. It seemed the whole town was blacked out. However, I could hear what seemed like rubbing and yelling in the distance. I could listen to concussive bangs that could only mean one thing: gunshots. 

Getting scared, I walked back towards the house. However, I stopped when I saw Mrs. Saddler's front door open. I heard the sounds of rattling pans and movement in the house. Was Mrs. Saddler awake? 

I cautiously walked up the steps into her home, seeing the front door open and the house dark. With a flashlight, I walked up the steps into the living room. The living room mainly seemed normal, though the carpets were damaged for some reason, like something heavy had dragged on them. 

""Mrs Saddler? Are you okay?"" I asked as I walked deeper. I heard thumping as I walked down the hallway towards her room. My heart pounded as I made my way down, flashlight shaking. ""Mrs Saddler?"" I asked again. No response. I crept my way to her bedroom, seeing that it was cracked open. Leaning in, I heard nothing at all. 

I gently opened the door to find‚Ä¶ nothing. The room was empty aside from the furniture. Saddler wasn't in her bed at all. I breathed a slight sigh of relief that she wasn't dead or anything, but I was still worried since I didn't see her anywhere. 

I closed the bedroom door and walked back down the hallway. As I walked past the kitchen, I suddenly nearly slipped. I pointed my flashlight down at the ground. Blood. A puddle of fresh blood on the ground. My heart began to pound, my breathing becoming rapid. Fear flooded my mind as I heard the sounds of growling and crunching. I slowly turned my flashlight on in the kitchen. 

A trail of blood poured down the floor from behind the kitchen counter, which still had flour and baking residue from the cookies we had baked earlier yesterday. I very slowly began to lift my flashlight over the countertop. A dark gray mass was bent over Mrs Saddler's body. The thing was scaly, the light reflecting off its surface, with spines coming off its back. It growled and groaned in terrifying sounds as it slowly rose from its kneeling position. 

The creature rose. It had the face of nightmares, the face of a horrific crocodile or lizard. Sharp yellow teeth, stained with blood, snarled outward. The creature must be at least seven or eight feet tall, almost reaching the house's ceiling. Its body was toned, with muscles that could lift hundreds of pounds. It sported a pair of sharp claws that could cut through flesh and bone like butter. However, its eyes‚Ä¶ its horrific, piercing amber eyes bore into mine as I turned to face it, blood dripping down its body. It let out a snarl before rushing towards me with a roar. 

I screamed and ran out of the kitchen and towards the front door. My legs pumped as I could hear the creature tearing up the furniture to get after me. I ran out of the house and into the front yard. I listened to the sounds of screeching tires as Dad's truck pulled into the driveway. The doors opened, and Dad ran out with his friend Paul. 

""MARY! MARY! GET BEHIND ME!"" He yelled, grabbing me by the arm. Armed with a shotgun on his side, Paul ran over to us. They looked at Saddler's house as the monster's roar came through. The beast ran to the entrance, stopping to see us standing there. Looks of pure terror were on both my Dad's and Paul's faces at the sight of the bloodied creature. The thing opened its mouth, letting out a series of growls and grumbles. It was almost like it was speaking. 

It rushed towards us with terrifying speed, roaring before Paul pulled out his shotgun and fired. The loud sound of the gun startled me as I heard the creature scream in agony. I looked over to see Paul shoot the beast in the shoulder. I grabbed it's arm before I heard Paul cock his gun back and firing a second time, this time hitting it in the face. Blood and brain matter splattered on the grass as the creature slumped over, dead. 

I turned to face Dad, who hugged me and held me in his arms tightly than I had ever felt. Through watery eyes, he looked at me. 

""It's okay, honey. You're safe. We'll get out of town and head somewhere safe, okay?"" He said. 

I nodded my head. He hurried me into the truck, as I heard our neighbor Margaret coming outside. 

""Harper? What is all this noice? What is going on?"" She yelled from across the street.

""MARGRET! GET BACK INSIDE YOUR HOUSE! LOCK YOUR DOORS AND GET YOUR GUN NOW!!"" He yelled at her while getting into the passenger seat. Paul hopped into the driver's seat as he did a turn around and backed out down the street. 

""Mary, get your seatbelt on now!"" Dad said. I quickly strapped the belt over my body as we drove out of the neighborhood. As we turned around to leave, several other monstrous lizards appeared from behind Saddler's and our house. 

""Holy shit Harper!"" Paul said. 

""Don't just sit there! DRIVE!"" Dad yelled. 

Paul slammed on the gas as we drove past them, one of the monsters using a weapon to smash off the side mirror. I looked behind me, seeing those monsters rushing towards Margret, who was hurrying back towards her house. I prayed she got back in time. 

I looked back over at Dad as we drove through the neighborhood. Many houses had their doors broken down, with broken windows, smashed walls, and blood stains on the ground. Some houses had scratch marks on them. Cars were trashed and broken, with shattered glass on the streets and car alarms going off all around. 

""Dad‚Ä¶ what's going on?"" I asked, shaking in fear.

""We don't know."" He said. 

""I've never seen anything like them,"" Paul said.

""Are they demons?"" I asked.

""We don't‚Ä¶ know,"" Dad said.

""Where are we going?"" I asked. 

""We're going to try to head out. Somewhere where they still have power, we can call for help,"" Dad said.

""Yeah, but then where?"" Paul asked.

""I don't know. Oconto or Broken Bow? Just far away! Anywhere we can call the state troopers or the military. How much gas do we have?"" Dad asked. 

""Around half a tank,"" Paul said. 

""Okay, we'll go down Pacific, then head down Gary and make our way to the highway. Then we're out,"" Dad said. 

I curled up in my thoughts. I couldn't stop thinking about Saddler. Seeing her dead‚Ä¶ There was so much blood. And that thing was munching on her organs. The primal hunger in its eyes. The snarles. It was the stuff of nightmares. When I closed my eyes, I could still see those eyes. Those hungry, menacing eyes. 

I heard the truck get down on Pacific, and the road is getting slightly smoother. I looked back up, only to see us going down the high school, which was now in flames. 

""Oh my god,"" Dad said as we passed the burning building, the orange and yellow flames enveloping the sign advertising graduations taking place next week. Tears streamed down my face as I crumbled back up into a ball. This can't be happening. This must be some nightmare. I just needed to wake up. 

I looked back up to see Paul slamming the brakes. I looked up. A massive band of monsters was parked outside the main road, blocking it. Each was armed with a weapon, some with a sword, while others had rifles. 

""FUCK!!! Looks like they're smarter than we thought! Hold on to something!"" Paul yells. 

I held onto the seat as he swerved the truck, turning around completely as the monsters rushed forward. We heard loud sounds of electricity or some Star Wars sound effect. Looking out the window, the guns firing at us shot red beams of light, like they were laser guns. 

One of the shots managed to hit the back window, shattering the glass. I ducked down as the glass flew through the truck. 

""GET DOWN!! GET DOWN!!"" Dad yelled at me as Paul drove down the street. I could hear the shotgun going off as the truck swerved down the street. The faint glow of what I assumed was the school as we ducked back the opposite way we came. I held my head as we sped off down the road. 

As we fled the scene, a loud rumbling sound began to creep up, almost like a plane flying overhead. I looked up and out the window as the sound quickly became deafening. 

""WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?"" Paul yelled over the loud sound. I looked outside and saw a huge craft flying over the town, shining lights all around it. It wasn't a plane or anything that we could have built. It looked like an alien spaceship. It flew over our car and towards the center of town. 

""Fucking hell! Hold on to something!"" Paul yelled.

We were heading into the center of town. Screams and people yelling filled the air. A few cars drove past as we sped past the hospital and towards the police station. I saw a bunch of those monsters chasing after people as they fled. Some were firing their guns at people while they fought back. Others were running around in the streets. Cars were on fire, while the sounds of growls and roars came from around the town. Gunshots rang out on the roads as Paul navigated the chaos. 

We navigated through the hordes of people fleeing, Dad yelling at Paul to avoid people and the monsters. The two of them, yelling at each other, were drowned out by a horde of people running down the streets towards the center of town, and the monsters from the outside closed in. Dad yelled at Paul to turn the truck back from the horde of people running towards us. 

I turned around to see people fleeing and running. The monsters are grabbing people, biting them, and tearing them apart. I saw one monster bite a woman before her husband blasted its head off with a gun. Some police officers gunned down another beast as it tried to take someone's dog. People were on top of their cars and trucks, taking shots at the monsters left and right. Seems that people were not going down without a fight. 

As we went into reverse, I saw the spaceship from before fly away from the town before turning back around. Some contraption descended from the ship before it deployed a payload that came hurling towards downtown. 

""Dad! DAD!"" I yelled as the object came hurling towards us. As he looked at the descending object, Dad's face went cold with fear and terror. 

""Drive! DRIVE! PAUL DRIVE!!!"" He screamed as we floated it forward, not caring about who or what was before us. Everyone in the town stopped and began to run in the same direction. The sound of the object descending filled my senses as I finally got a better look at it. My eyes widened with horror.

As we barely made it away from downtown, the object collided with the ground, a bright flash of orange and yellow engulfed it, and a mushroom cloud rose from it. The shockwave rippled in front. Everything seemed to be going in slow motion as the truck's windows were blown out and flipped over. I screamed as the truck was thrown before everything went black.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

A loud ringing came through my ears as my senses slowly came back. I could feel sharp pain in my legs and head as the sounds of fire and explosions came from all around me. My vision returned as I saw blurry flashes of light that slowly turned into police car lights flashing among the flames. Sounds of people screaming and roars came back. I looked out the broken car window to see a woman being grabbed and dragged away by one of the snarling monsters. 

I was lying on the roof of the truck, the truck having flipped upside down. Thankfully, I was wearing my seat belt, but I still had an injury on my head. My left leg, however, was screaming in pain. I couldn't see what was wrong, but I could feel it.

""Mary! Mary! Are you okay?"" I could hear Dad calling for me. I saw Dad's head come in through the broken window, Dad cutting himself slightly on the shattered glass, but he didn't seem to care at all. I coughed as he reached in to grab me.

""Y-Yeah. I'm okay, but I'm hurt."" I said. 

""It's okay, sweetie. I'm coming to help. I got you."" He said.

He grabbed me as I began crawling out of the flipped-over truck. The pain in my leg got worse as I crawled out of the car, trying not to cut myself on the broken glass. Dad helped prop me up as we could now see the full extent of my injuries. My ankle was bruised near the foot, swollen, and in severe pain. I tried to put pressure on it, but the pain was too unbearable. 

""Oh shit. There's no way you can walk on that."" Dad said. 

""It's okay, Dad. I can do it. It just needs some work."" I said, tears rolling down my face at the pain. 

""No, you can't, honey. I'll help you."" Dad said.

Paul came running over, shotgun in hand. ""WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!"" He yelled. A loud growling came from behind him as one of the monsters, bloodied and snarling, lunged at him. Paul opened fire with his gun, blasting the creature, which fell to the ground dead. 

As I looked over the streets, the whole downtown was engulfed in flames. The explosion had killed most of the people putting up a resistance, leaving them mostly free to pillage. The bright glow illuminated the area, allowing us to see all the creatures around us. 

Standing before the fire, a massive creature, covered in plated armor, stood with his gun in hand. He snarled over the remaining townsfolk. One of his eyes appeared to be blinded, with some scarring around the eye socket, as if someone or something had stabbed him in the eye. He must be the leader of whatever demon spawns these. Was this creature Satan himself? 

Surrounding him were a whole bunch of creatures that stood over the burning ruins of the town. He mouthed a bunch of commands in some unknown language, and they all roared out and began their second assault. Dad quickly scooped me up into his arms and began to run down the alleyways of the still-intact buildings. Paul followed behind us, firing at anything that moved. 

The bright light of the raging flames was replaced by darkness as we ducked behind the Community Center. Paul followed in close behind. 

""We have to get to the creek. It's just past work on the other side of the field. We can hide there."" Paul said. 

""Okay. How many shots do you have?"" Dad asked. 

""I'm all out,"" Paul said.

""Fuck. We have to move. We don't have a choice. Maybe if we hide from them, we can get to the highway and find someone to help. Mary needs to get to a hospital."" Dad said. 

""What? We get to the next town on foot?"" Paul said.

""We don't have any other option, unless you want to ask one of them to take you in their ship!"" Dad yelled back.

""Keep your voice down! You're going to get us caught. Come on, let's move."" Paul said. 

We both began to move across the street towards the Grain factory where my Dad works. We ran in between the metal buildings that housing the grain moving equipment and past towards the massive grain silos. At this point, though, my Dad couldn't carry me any further, and we stopped to rest behind the Agri-Best Feeds building. 

Panting as he set me down, I leaned against the metal wall as my Dad caught his breath. We could hear the sounds of fire and screaming, but the gunshots had stopped, replaced with the eerie sounds of growling and distant hums of the ship over the town. We breathed deeply as Dad got back on his feet. He was so clearly exhausted beyond what he could handle. He hadn't had any sleep, worked a ten-hour shift almost, and had been running around for who knows how long being chased by demons. 

We suddenly heard sirens in the distance. We looked down the field in front of us. Right down the road, we could see the flashing lights and sirens of the state troopers, having arrived. They must have seen the explosion!

""Thank fuck! The state troopers!!"" Paul yelled. Dad scooped me up in his arms again when one of those monsters suddenly emerged from the darkness behind us, lunging at us. We ran towards the flashing lights, the sirens blaring our salvation from this nightmare. Several other people from the town joined in, and several people ran into the field with the monsters on our heels. 

""OVER HERE!!! HELP US!!!"" Paul and Dad yelled as we ran across the field. Looking back, we saw that creatures were giving chase but then slowed and stopped near the field, not following us. The lights and sirens suddenly shut off, leaving us back in the darkness. Dad and Paul stood around in the dark field in confusion.

""Hello?! HELLO?! Someone help us! Please!"" Dad called out. 

""The fuck?!"" Paul yelled.

The light suddenly shone down from the spaceship hovering over us as tons of demons swarmed in from the trap they had laid. People screamed as they were attacked and taken back to their landed mothership. Paul and Dad ran, but one of the monsters grabbed Paul by the leg. He used the gun to hit the monster on the snout before it caught the weapon, throwing it to the side. 

""PAUL!!! PAUL!!!"" Dad yelled as he ran to help his friend. Paul screamed and yelled at Dad to keep running as the lizards grabbed him and carried him away to their ship. Dad ran after him, only for one of the creatures to roar at him, striking him down with a swipe of its claws. Dad and I fell to the ground, landing on the grass with a thud. 

I pulled myself up on my hands and knees, seeing Dad getting up, with a bloody scratch on his face from the swipe he got. 

""Mary! Mary! Are you okay?"" He asked. I nodded my head. Suddenly, the monsters rushed towards us, snarling, weapons in hand, ready to take us on their ship. Dad got up, pulling me into his arms as he ran towards a nearby farm. 

The run over to the farm was a blur. Everything was slowly becoming a blurry fight for survival. We ran on the property, seeing a barn with the doors open. Dad rushed into the barn, setting me down on the ground before turning around and closing the doors, locking them with the massive lock. He backed away from the door as pounding and growling could be heard from the other side. 

Dad knelt beside me, tears in his eyes as he hugged me. 

""I love you, Mary. I love you so much, "" he cried. I hugged him back, tears flowing down my cheeks. 

""I love you, too, Dad,"" I said. 

As we looked over, we heard creaking metal from behind. We had forgotten to secure the door on the other side! The door swung open as a horde of lizard monsters entered. 

""Oh shit!"" I yelled. The loud rumbling sound of the ship drowned out my voice. It must be directly over the barn. 

Dad grabbed me and headed towards a ladder that led to the barn's attic. ""Get up the ladder! Pull yourself up there! Get up the ladder!"" Dad yelled. 

He pushed me up as high as he could as he made his way up. I reached the top of the rafters, reaching the lip of the door at the top. I grabbed the edges and used strength I didn't know I had to pull myself up to the top. 

I turned around to see Dad climbing the ladder when the lizards suddenly grabbed him from behind. He yelled as he tried to punch and kick them, but he wasn't far enough away from them to properly fight back. They grabbed him by the waist before grabbing him by the arms and legs so he couldn't move. 

""DAD!!! DAD!!! NO!!!"" I yelled. 

He yelled at me to hide as he was hauled away. I yelled and screamed for him as I saw one of the lizards climbing the ladder towards me. I quickly grabbed the wooden door and slammed it shut before it could reach the top.

Now alone in the dark rafters, I moved back towards the corner of the roof. Was this it? Was this how it was going to end, alone in the dark attic of a barn? I was too scared to move as the loud pounding came through the door, and it suddenly broke. The creature emerged from the darkness as it crawled up into the attic. I was surrounded by several pairs of eyes that seemed to come from all around me. 

I curled up into a ball, hoping the sounds of their snarls would go away. The sounds of engines roaring and monsters crawling around me filled my senses. I could hear the sounds of cracking wood and breaking boards. Light began to flood in, illuminating the creatures around me and my surroundings. I could feel the walls behind me giving way before they suddenly broke. 

Gray scaly hands grabbed me from behind as I was violently lifted out of the barn and into the air. The creature was attached to a hoist and cable and was directly lifted back into the ship. I screamed and wailed as I was lifted into the air, this creature holding me with a snarl.

The barn lifted away from me, a massive hole in its roof. I looked over to see the once beautiful town, now destroyed, and its downtown in flames. Figures still ran around, mopping up any remaining people. I squirmed and screamed for the creature to put me down and for someone to help, only for it to fall on deaf ears. I gave one last look at the ruins of my home. That may be the last time I saw Callaway again. 

The light around us shut off as we reached the ship. All I could do was muster a whimper. I closed my eyes, hoping I would wake back up in bed, this whole thing being a terrible dream.

Okay, I realize this is a bit of a dense post, but let's do it anyway.

I've recently been laid off (3rd time in 4 years, tech has been BRUTAL) and two of my friends up in Fairbanks have offered me a guest bed and as much coffee as I can drink. It's a generous offer, I love Fairbanks, but I'm not sure I could find work there. 

Here's the rub: I'm immunocompromised, severely. I'm vaccinated against everything I can be vaccinated against, but I have so little immune system right now (and until medical science changes, that WON'T change) that I could probably get measles anyway and it runs the real risk of being lethal for me. I did get Whooping Cough last year and it was horrible. I need to find a company who can work with me on, at most, a hybrid schedule. I have a TON of people who will attest that I will work pretty damn hard at home, however. I don't wander off to fish, hike, nap, DIY, etc. (I've been working a hybrid schedule since 2008, and fully remote since 2017. No schlub.)

It was Karthik‚Äôs first day at work 
technically an internship, but to him, it felt like the beginning of the rest of his life. Fresh out of college, dressed in his crisply ironed shirt, laptop in tow, he had rehearsed his introduction in front of the mirror all morning.

‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Karthik‚Ä¶ I just graduated and I‚Äôm excited to‚Äù

He snapped out of his thoughts as the gleaming towers of DLF Cyber City loomed ahead. This was it. The place his seniors talked about in reverence, where they claimed real life began 
caffeine fueled deadlines, impromptu office parties, elevators that spoke, and the ultimate joy: the monthly salary text.

His internship had been arranged by his father‚Äôs friend, a well-connected man in the tech industry. Thanks to that, Karthik had a special gate pass. As he approached the security checkpoint, a long queue of employees waited, grumbling. Something seemed off 
multiple guards, more serious than usual, barking into walkie talkies.

Yet, when Karthik flashed his pass, the guards looked at each other briefly and then nodded. ‚ÄúGo on in, sir.‚Äù

He was in. No questions.

It felt‚Ä¶ wrong.

He turned back to glance at the workers being held up some were being told to wait, others turned away. He brushed the thought aside, chalking it up to protocol, and walked into the heart of DLF.

But the silence struck first.

The usual bustle of coffee carts, footsteps, and the hum of conversation was missing. As he walked past the central atrium, something shattered above glass.

And then came the scream.

Karthik ducked instinctively behind a column. In the distance, a black armored vehicle smashed through the main lobby entrance. Men, fully suited in tactical gear, faces covered, carrying high end weapons, flooded in with terrifying precision. They weren‚Äôt guards. They weren‚Äôt cops. This was something else.

Missiles? Guns? Who brings missiles into a tech park?

Karthik‚Äôs breath caught in his throat. He wasn‚Äôt trained for this. He wasn‚Äôt even sure he‚Äôd signed any insurance documents yet.

People ran some tried to fight, most didn‚Äôt get the chance. A small group, including Karthik, managed to slip through a side stairwell as gunfire echoed through the glass halls of the once-busy office complex.

Two people in the group were hit non lethally, but enough to be dragged away by the attackers. The rest of them ran. Fast.

Karthik clutched his bag. Inside was his laptop. A battered machine, but one he had configured for side projects‚Äîcybersecurity simulations, ethical hacking trials. It was just a hobby. Until now.

They found temporary shelter in a construction site at the far edge of the complex barely built, scaffolding everywhere, but safe enough to breathe. Karthik‚Äôs heart thumped. His hands trembled. But he knew he had to do something.

He flipped open his laptop, connected to a nearby unsecured network node (thank you, lazy contractors), and began digging.

He cross-referenced security feeds he had hacked into, news alerts, and deep web chatter. These attackers weren‚Äôt random. They were part of a rogue tech-mercenary group rumored in dark forums a group codenamed ‚ÄúPhantom Stack‚Äù, believed to be hired by corporations to sabotage or extract critical data. But DLF? Why here?

And more importantly what were they after?

Karthik looked at the scared faces around him. He didn‚Äôt feel like a fresher anymore. Not quite. This wasn‚Äôt the work life his seniors warned him about. It wasn‚Äôt deadlines or feedback emails or awkward icebreakers.

This was war.

**Discover how Bitcoin ATMs and the Bitcoin QR Code Maker app make buying and selling crypto as easy as tapping your phone and scanning a code.**  
  
**Link:** [**https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)

In the age of fast food, faster phones, and instant gratification, it only makes sense that Bitcoin is getting the drive-thru treatment ‚Äî sort of. Enter the **Bitcoin ATM**: a magical machine that looks like a regular cash ATM but spits out crypto instead of twenties. Yes, it's real. Yes, it works. And yes, it‚Äôs changing how people interact with money.

But here‚Äôs the fun twist: Bitcoin ATMs are only part of the revolution. The other half? That would be the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) ‚Äî your new favorite crypto sidekick. This slick tool lets anyone generate beautiful, scannable Bitcoin payment QR codes in seconds. No coding, no confusion ‚Äî just copy, paste, and boom ‚Äî your wallet address turns into a payment button, a sticker, or even a T-shirt if you're feeling extra bold.

Let‚Äôs take a quick field trip.

Imagine you‚Äôre strolling through a busy city. You spot a glowing kiosk on the corner, looking like a rebel vending machine. You approach. It's a **Bitcoin ATM**. In under a minute, you scan your Bitcoin QR code, insert a few bills, confirm the rate, and presto ‚Äî you've just stacked some sats without needing a single banking app. No waiting, no forms, no awkward ‚Äúcontact your bank‚Äù errors.

But how did you get that Bitcoin wallet address onto your phone in such a tidy, scannable square? That‚Äôs where the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** swoops in like a caped coder. You visited the site, typed in your wallet address, clicked a button, and out came a sleek QR code that even grandma could scan. Want to collect donations? Sell merch for BTC? Pay a friend back without fumbling through app menus? Just create a custom payment link or QR code and drop it anywhere.

Bitcoin ATMs and the QR code maker go together like peanut butter and blockchain. They simplify the process of using Bitcoin in the real world ‚Äî turning abstract strings of letters and numbers into physical, real-world interactions. Whether you‚Äôre using an ATM to cash out or scanning a QR code to pay for coffee, the future of finance is looking a whole lot more user-friendly.

And it‚Äôs not just fun ‚Äî it‚Äôs powerful. These tools give anyone with an internet connection access to a global financial network, no bank required. Add a little creativity (we‚Äôve seen QR codes on stickers, tip jars, and even tattoos), and you‚Äôve got a decentralized payment system that fits in your pocket.

So next time you see a Bitcoin ATM, don‚Äôt just walk past it. Tap it. Scan it. And if you haven‚Äôt already, fire up the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) to join the fun side of finance.

I've been testing the Nike DZ7533-700 Men's Basketball Shoe for a few weeks now, and honestly, it‚Äôs been an experience I didn‚Äôt expect. These shoes are more than just footwear ‚Äì they feel like a journey back to Sepolia, the city where Giannis honed his skills. That connection is innovative and makes them less of a shoe and more of a storytelling piece. While they truly shine in certain areas, there's some room for nitpicking, depending on what you're looking for.

**Comfort and Fit**

Putting them on for the first time was like slipping into memory foam, but sport-specific. These sneakers are clearly designed with today‚Äôs fast-paced basketball in mind. They‚Äôre softer than previous versions, which results in ultimate comfort during long sessions. My nephew, a teenager with size 12 wide feet, didn‚Äôt complain once about pinching or stiffness ‚Äî a frequent issue he's had with other brands. 

The lace-up closure system is very secure, and the three-quarters height offers that extra ankle support without restricting movement. The inner material, being manmade, felt surprisingly breathable even during an intense trial game played on an outdoor court. Props to Nike for making a product that doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs suffocating my feet ten minutes in.

**Traction and Durability on All Surfaces**

Testing these out, I didn‚Äôt stick to one type of surface. The traction pattern on the outsole is phenomenal, especially for sharp cuts, stops, and those Giannis-like Euro-Steps. On asphalt courts and polished hardwood floors, they held their grip impressively well. 

However, dustier indoor courts exposed some weaknesses. Once the sole collected debris, it lost a bit of its initial bite, needing a quick wipe-off to regain full traction. It‚Äôs not a deal breaker, but if you‚Äôre someone who plays often in gyms that aren‚Äôt impeccably clean, keep a cloth handy.

**Design Aesthetic with Giannis‚Äô Inspiration**

Talk about a shoe that makes a statement. The vibrant colorway and synthetic outer material brought numerous compliments when I wore them casually. The homage to Sepolia‚Äôs courts is subtle but powerful, with detailed incorporations that basketball fans will appreciate. Even my coworker ‚Äî someone who doesn‚Äôt follow basketball ‚Äî wanted to know the backstory after spotting them under my desk.

These shoes walk the line almost seamlessly between court performance and streetwear appeal. Paired them with black joggers one evening; suddenly, it felt like I knew more about fashion than I actually do. That‚Äôs the kind of vibe they bring to the table.

**Positives**

- Exceptional comfort with improved midsole softness.
- Outstanding traction for Euro-Steps and sudden directional changes.
- The unique Sepolia-inspired design appeals to both athletes and sneaker collectors.
- Versatile enough for both intense sports and stylish casual wear.

**Shortcomings**

- Traction isn‚Äôt as impressive on dusty indoor courts.
- Three-pound weight might feel slightly heavy for some players, especially those used to lighter models.
- The manmade materials, while durable, may not have the premium feel some competitors offer at similar price points.

**Product Contenders**

Comparing these to other basketball sneakers, like the Adidas Harden Vol 7, there‚Äôs an interesting tradeoff. While the Hardens are supremely lightweight and provide epic heel support, they lack the storytelling punch and versatility of the Nike DZ7533-700. On the flip side, Under Armour Curry Flow 10s dominate a bit more in the traction department, particularly on gym floors, but feel less forgiving on wider feet when things heat up. Nike seems to situate itself as the stylish pick while delivering comparative performance.

**Cost Efficiency**

What struck me most was how much these shoes deliver at their price point. While the cost isn't the lowest in its category, the brand heritage, thoughtful design tied to Giannis‚Äô story, and all-purpose usage elevate the overall value. If you‚Äôre someone like me who splits time between pick-up games and coffee runs, this might be your ultimate all-in-one basketball shoe.

1kilpol,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kilpol/explore_if_the_keurig_k10_mini_plus_singleserve/,Explore if the Keurig K10 Mini Plus single-serve brewer lives up: review,"The Keurig K10 Mini Plus Orange Single Serve Personal Brewer caught my attention because of its promise of convenience and style. This little brewer doesn‚Äôt just claim compactness; it truly delivers with dimensions of 12 x 10 x 10 inches. As someone working in a shared office, I was keen to test if this compact coffee maker could seamlessly fit on our tiny communal countertop. After a few weeks of daily use, I‚Äôve got plenty of insights, both good and bad, to share about the product.

**Compact and Vibrant Design**  
The design of this coffee brewer stood out immediately. Its bold orange color adds personality to any kitchen or office space, breaking up the monotony of typical stainless or black appliances. It's ideal for small spaces, whether nestled in a corner of your kitchen counter or sitting proudly on your desk in a studio apartment. Adding to the allure is its lightweight build‚Äîjust 0.01 ounces (yes, incredibly light). I appreciated the size and portability when I had to relocate it for a team event. A machine this portable was surprisingly sturdy though, as it held its own through multiple moves.

**Easy Operation with Custom Options**  
The fully automatic operation mode is a godsend for those rushed mornings. With this brewer, there are no complex buttons or confusing processes‚Äîit‚Äôs straightforward and beginner-friendly. It comes with a reusable filter, which means you can either brew pre-packaged pods or use your favorite ground coffee. I've tried brewing different styles of coffee, from medium roast to flavored blends, and each cup turned out warm and consistent. Adjusting the water quantity for a stronger brew was smooth and intuitive, a feature that made me skip my trips to the caf√© downstairs.

[Ready to buy Keurig K10 Mini Plus Single Serve Personal Brewer? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00rd8304k/)  

**Advantages**  
- Lightweight and extremely portable.  
- Its bold orange shade adds a personality boost to the appliance.  
- Easy-to-use operation mode suitable even for coffee beginners.  

**Limitations**  
- Lacks a water reservoir feature, requiring refilling for every cup.  
- Can occasionally produce noise during brewing.  

**Performance and Speed**  
Speed is where this brewer shines. Brewing takes less than three minutes from start to finish‚Äîa lifesaver for busy mornings or when you‚Äôre rushing to meet deadlines. However, it isn‚Äôt silent‚Äîdon‚Äôt expect stealthy brewing while others are asleep. Still, the noise isn‚Äôt unbearable, but something to consider for quieter environments. Each cup comes out piping hot, and the temperature consistency across different coffee types impressed me.

**Product Comparisons**  
Comparing this to similar single-serve coffee makers on the market, the Keurig K10 Mini Plus holds its ground for design and portability. For instance, the Keurig K-Mini has a slightly sleeker design but lacks the distinctive color options of the K10. Meanwhile, competitors like the Nespresso Essenza Mini boast advanced features like espresso brewing, but they come at a higher price and don‚Äôt allow the same versatility with ground coffee. This coffee maker sits perfectly between budget-friendly utility and personalized style without overshooting the price.

**Cost Efficiency**  
When it comes to price-to-quality ratio, the product is stellar in its category. Its compact design, automatic features, and reusable filter eliminate the need for expensive pods or trips to coffee shops. It saves money in the long run without making sacrifices in terms of flavor or warmth. For those on a budget, it‚Äôs an incredible value product that doesn‚Äôt compromise too heavily on features.

1kilpbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatioParadise/comments/1kilpbe/why_should_you_consider_the_patiofestival_patio/,Why Should You Consider the PatioFestival Patio Furniture Conversation Set Review?,"The PatioFestival B087LZJ7VQ 4 Pcs Patio Furniture Conversation Set has been my go-to for testing over the past few weeks, and it‚Äôs fair to say it has left me with a mix of impressions. Let me break it down into several key areas to give you a real sense of what owning this outdoor furniture set feels like in everyday use.

**Design That Combines Style With Practicality**  
This furniture set, with its lovely blue cushions and sleek metal frames, adds a calming aesthetic to any outdoor space‚Äîfrom backyards to patios and even small balconies. The loveseat, coffee table, and two rocking chairs offer a modern look that feels equally inviting and practical for gatherings or personal relaxation. The ergonomic design of the chairs ensures long-term comfort, with the back cushions providing excellent support for extended usage. But here‚Äôs the catch: the chairs are definitely on the heavier side, weighing just over 117 pounds collectively, which means moving them around frequently isn‚Äôt a breeze. This isn‚Äôt necessarily an issue if the setup is pre-planned, though.  

**Comfort Matters ‚Äì And This Set Delivers**  
I must say, the rocking chairs in this setup are the clear MVPs. The smooth, backwards-and-forwards gliding motion immediately became my favorite feature, bringing a cozy rhythm to quiet afternoons. On top of that, the Olefin fabric-covered cushions seal the deal. These cushion covers are durable and weather-resistant, though after a surprise drizzle, I realized they could take some extra time to dry entirely. Just something to consider if you live in an area prone to sudden rain showers.

**Check [PatioFestival B087LZJ7VQ] price on Amazon.**

**Functionality and Build Quality**  
The overall sturdiness of this set is hard to ignore, given the metal used in its construction. It feels structured, as if it was designed to withstand the occasional rough treatment from playtime with kids or pets. Another thoughtful piece of engineering involves anti-skid rubber foot cushions under each chair and table leg. Not only does this prevent unwanted sliding on slick surfaces, but it also provides that added sense of safety while using them. The coffee table is both spacious (39.8 by 23.8 inches) and well-suited for outdoor meals or lounging with drinks and snacks, but I do wish it had a tempered glass or alternative covering that adds a touch of polish.

**Strengths**  
- Tall and comfortable cushioning, reducing back strain.  
- Anti-skid features ensure stability, even on slippery or tiled patios.  
- Ergonomic rocking mechanism providing relaxation with smooth motion.  
- Spacious and strong coffee table able to handle multiple items.  

**Cons**  
- Susceptible to prolonged drying time if cushions get wet from rain.  
- The combined weight makes relocation challenging.  

**Ease of Assembly**  
Putting this set together turned out to be surprisingly straightforward. Everything came neatly packaged with the necessary tools and hardware included in the box. A few YouTube tutorials further simplified the process for me. However, make sure you set aside at least an hour and possibly ask for a second pair of hands if you‚Äôre assembling all the pieces at once. 

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other patio furniture sets in this category, like the Greesum 3-Piece Rocker Set or Devoko Conversation Set, the PatioFestival Set boasts a noticeable edge in the rocking mechanism and cushion quality. While the Greesum set is lighter to move around, it doesn‚Äôt bring the same level of ergonomic comfort as this one. On the flip side, Devoko‚Äôs all-weather rattan design appears more resilient against water exposure, so that‚Äôs worth considering if your area frequently encounters unpredictable weather.

**Cost Efficiency**  
In terms of affordability, this set lands right in the mid-range of outdoor furniture options. It feels like a fair investment if you‚Äôre looking for a blend of style, comfort, and functionality without tipping your budget towards premium-tier options. There are cheaper alternatives out there, but you often lose out on sturdy materials or finish quality. That being said, regular patio users and anyone keen on long-term durability will likely appreciate what this brings to the table.

1kill8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kill8o/does_the_nespresso_vertuo_pop_coffee_maker_review/,Does the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Coffee Maker Review Reveal Its True Value?,"Testing the Nespresso ENV92B Vertuo Pop+ Coffee and Espresso Machine by De'Longhi, Liquorice Black has been nothing short of an eventful coffee journey. I've been brewing coffee with this sleek machine every morning, and it's both refined my caffeine routine and added a stylish touch to my kitchen. Packed with modern features, this espresso machine has been designed to impress, although there's a mix of both advantages and minor shortcomings.

**Compact Design that Fits Anywhere**  
The compact and minimalistic design of this coffee and espresso machine is one of its most enticing traits. Measuring in at 14 inches in depth and just 8.6 inches in width, it fits seamlessly on my already-cramped kitchen counter. I first thought its size might compromise function, but I quickly realized I was wrong. The stylish Liquorice Black color adds a bold yet elegant finish‚Äîa lovely departure from generic stainless steel. It also feels sturdy while managing to be relatively lightweight at under 8 pounds, making it easy to move when cleaning kitchen surfaces. The materials seem thoughtfully chosen, with 35% recycled plastic, which I appreciated as a nice nod toward sustainability.  

**Features that Elevate Performance**  
This is where the machine truly shines. With five different cup sizes‚ÄîEspresso, Double Espresso, Gran Lungo, XL Coffee, and even Iced Coffee‚Äîit caters to every possible coffee mood. The patented Centrifusion technology, a term I'd never heard of before but have now come to respect, automatically reads the barcode on the Nespresso capsule to extract just the right flavor profile. That‚Äôs a game-changer for inconsistency-prone individuals like myself. The one-touch brewing system was intuitive from day one, and the 30-second heat-up time was such a relief when I was running late. Its automatic shutoff is a peace-of-mind bonus; there's no more worrying whether I unplugged it before leaving for work.

[Find the best price for Nespresso ENV92B on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dvd67f76/)

**Benefits**  
- Offers multiple serving sizes, including rare options like Gran Lungo and Iced Coffee.  
- Centrifusion technology delivers perfectly calibrated brewing for each capsule.  
- Quick heat-up time means no waiting around in the morning.  

**Flavor Quality and Crema Perfection**  
As a coffee enthusiast, what truly mattered to me was the taste‚Äîit didn't disappoint. Brewing my favorite capsules offered a rich, aromatic experience. I'm a sucker for the thick crema layer that forms on top of each cup; it's like a seal of luxury to start the day. Even with larger servings, the taste maintained its boldness and balance. I also experimented with iced coffees on warmer afternoons, and I loved how the machine managed to retain flavor depth despite being served chill.  

**Negatives**  
- Capsule dependency limits experimentation with freshly ground coffee.  
- Capsule cost can quickly add up if you‚Äôre a frequent drinker like I am.    
- The water reservoir, while conveniently placed on the side, could have been slightly larger for serving groups.  

**Maintenance and Tech Integration**  
Cleaning up after brewing couldn‚Äôt have been simpler. The used capsule container was easy to empty, and the app-controlled connectivity made the upkeep process super straightforward. Through the app on my phone, I've been able to update the machine's software, which keeps the brewing performance optimized. The app interface is user-friendly, though I wouldn't say it's a vital feature unless you're an absolute tech lover.

**Product Rivals**  
When compared to other single-serve coffee makers like the Keurig K-Supreme Plus or the Breville Bambino Plus, this machine stands out for its design and espresso quality. For crema layers and flavor precision, it clearly surpasses those competitors. However, the Keurig provides more flexibility in beans and beverages simply because it isn‚Äôt capsule-reliant. On the flip side, the Bambino excels for those who value manual frothing ability, an area this machine skips entirely.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Does it justify its price tag? Honestly, it depends on your coffee habits and budget. The enriching coffee experience and convenience feel worth it to me, even with the exclusive capsule requirement. Frequent coffee drinkers and capsule enthusiasts will find it a valuable investment. Casual coffee consumers might hesitate once they consider the recurring cost for Nespresso pods.

The scent of lilies hung thick in the air, their funeral sweetness turning my stomach as I knelt in the dim light of the cathedral. My black dress felt too tight across my shoulders, constricting my already labored breathing as I tried to focus on my prayer.



\*Six days. Just six more days until I would have to stand at this same altar for a very different ceremony.\*

The cathedral's vastness amplified even the softest sounds, which was why I could hear my mother's hushed voice from several pews behind me, despite her attempt at discretion.

""Robert, please. There must be another way."" My mother's whisper carried the weight of desperation. ""Sarah shouldn't have to sacrifice herself like this. Her dad just passed away, and her brother is still in critical condition.""

""Margaret,"" my uncle's tone was measured, calculated, ""this was Sarah's choice. The contract is signed.""

I rose from my prayer position, the rustle of my dress echoing through the sacred space. Turning to face them, I watched their expressions shift from surprise to guilt at being overheard.

""Mom."" My voice remained steady, though my heart ached at her obvious distress. ""Uncle Robert is right. This was my decision.""

My mother's face crumpled. ""But sweetheart, marrying a man in a vegetative state? This isn't what your father would have wanted.""

""What Father would have wanted,"" I met my uncle's gaze directly, ""was for Le Mitchell to survive. For his legacy to continue."" I stepped closer, my heels clicking against the stone floor. ""And I will do whatever it takes to protect what he built.""

A slight twitch in his jaw betrayed his irritation, but his smile remained perfectly pleasant. ""My dear niece, I'm only trying to help preserve our family's legacy.""

""By interfering in every decision I make?"" I raised an eyebrow. ""Le Mitchell is my responsibility now.""

I smoothed my dress, a gesture my grandmother had taught me to maintain composure. ""Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a wedding to prepare for.""

The week passed in a blur of final arrangements and sleepless nights. Before I knew it, I stood before the same altar, this time dressed in white. The cathedral was filled with Manhattan's elite ‚Äì bankers, politicians, old money families ‚Äì all here to witness the unusual union of Sarah Mitchell to James Thornton, the young financial prodigy who hadn't opened his eyes in six months.

I could feel their whispers, see their poorly concealed curiosity. The story had been all over the society pages: James Thornton's yacht explosion, his miraculous survival but unfortunate condition, and now this wedding, orchestrated by his grandmother Elizabeth after consulting some renowned psychic who claimed the celebration's positive energy might aid his recovery.

\*What they didn't know was the price tag attached to this arrangement ‚Äì eight million dollars, transferred to an account that would help save Le Mitchell from financial ruin after my father's death.\*

The ceremony itself was surreal. James remained in his private medical suite at Moon Lake Estate, while I exchanged vows with his official proxy. Every ""I do"" echoed through the cathedral like a business contract being sealed, which, in essence, it was.

\---

Moon Lake Estate loomed before me as my car pulled through the iron gates that evening.

Mrs. Wilson, the head housekeeper, waited at the entrance. Her posture was impeccable, her gray hair pulled into a severe bun that matched her equally severe expression.

""Welcome, Mrs. Thornton,"" she said, the new title falling from her lips with practiced neutrality. ""I trust the ceremony went well?""

""Yes, thank you."" I matched her professional tone. ""Where is James Thornton?""

""Mr. Thornton is upstairs with Miss Anderson. His lover.""

Before I could respond, a young maid ‚Äì Jenny, according to her nametag ‚Äì stepped forward to take my coat.

""Would you like me to show you to your room, Mrs. Thornton?"" Jenny's smile seemed genuine, unlike Mrs. Wilson's careful mask.

As we climbed the grand staircase, Jenny lowered her voice. ""Mrs. Thornton, I hope you don't mind me saying, but... be careful of Madeleine Anderson. She's been here almost every day since the accident, and she's made sure most of the staff are... loyal to her.""

I paused on the landing. ""Thank you, Jenny. I appreciate your honesty.""

The master suite occupied the entire west wing of the second floor. Jenny's knock was answered by a woman. I assumed she was Madeleine Anderson.

She was blonde, beautiful, and wearing an expression of practiced concern that didn't quite reach her eyes.

""Sarah,"" she stepped forward as if to embrace me, then thought better of it. ""I was just keeping James company. He always loved having me read to him.""

I entered the room, taking in the medical equipment that had transformed the bedroom into a private hospital suite. James lay still on the bed, his strong features peaceful in repose. A strange flutter went through my chest ‚Äì this was the first time I'd seen my husband in person.

""How thoughtful of you,"" I replied, setting my purse down. ""Though your services won't be necessary anymore.""

Her practiced smile faltered. ""James and I share a special bond. Surely you understand that a marriage certificate doesn't change years of history?""

""No, but it does change legal rights and responsibilities."" I met her gaze steadily. ""Mrs. Wilson?""

The housekeeper appeared in the doorway. ""Yes, Mrs. Thornton?""

""Please escort Miss Anderson out. From now on, she is not permitted to enter the estate without my explicit permission.""

Madeleine's face flushed with anger. ""You can't do this. You don't know him. You don't know what music he likes, what makes him laugh, how he takes his coffee‚Äî""

""I know that he's a brilliant financier who built an empire from nothing. I know he values loyalty above all else. And I know that despite your years of 'history,' he never proposed to you."" The words were sharp, precise. ""Now, please leave before I have security remove you.""

""You think this is about money? About status?"" Her voice rose, echoing off the wood-paneled walls. ""I love him. We love each other. And when he wakes up‚Äî""

""If and when my husband wakes up, we will deal with that situation as it comes. Mrs. Wilson, please‚Äî""

""Don't you dare!"" Madeleine's composure shattered completely. Her eyes blazed as she backed away from Mrs. Wilson's approach. ""Nobody can throw me out. I'm carrying James's child ‚Äì who would dare touch me?""

The words hung in the air like smoke. I kept my expression neutral, even as my mind raced through the implications. ""That's a serious claim, Madeleine.""

""It's not a claim, it's the truth."" Her hand moved protectively to her stomach. ""James and I were together the night before the accident. I'm carrying his child, and there's nothing you or your marriage certificate can do about that.""

She hasn't spoken to me since then and I'm feeling really guilty. I've discussed it with my buddies and they've told me I've done the right thing by telling them, but I still feel guilty. I wanna approach my sister and tell her that I only did it for her own sake.

I'm a class of 2018 Engineering alum and after working for 5 years and going back to school for a highly ranked MBA program in the US (think Harvard or Wharton), I still sorely miss my days at UW. Perhaps it was all of the time I spent goofing off with my friends in the engineering study lounges, late night trips to UW plaza, or maybe I was younger and was easier to make core memories then.  


Flash forward now and while people say an MBA is 2 year vacation and the ""best years of your life,"" I still find myself yearning for my undergrad days when we were all broke students living off of Paninos. At UW, I stopped caring about grades  in 2B or 3A or so and instead focused on passing and enjoying forming close relationships with friends and colleagues. I also have great memories studying late at DC library, grabbing a quick tim hortons coffee and getting back to studying. 

All this is to say... I read posts here where students are stressed out, or feeling lonely/isolated and I would encourage you to find relationships with your classmates or through student clubs so that you can all bond over the annoying and stressful stuff like finding a Coop or passing your exams.

  
That's all I have to share and if you are interested in chatting, DM me and I am happy to pay it forward with chatting about career mentorship or whatever is on your mind :). I believe alumni should do a better job with helping other UW students. It is the whole business model of the Ivy's in the US where it is basically a frat club of alumni helping other undergrads and I agree it is not very mericratic but there is no reason why UW alums shouldn't do the same!",5,1746804638.0,uwaterloo,0,0.86,False

I've put her on my 'Okay to s***-talk' list - AIO?","Hi, so I'm 37F who works in a small consultancy. I joined because of a colleague who I enjoy working with and the pay jump, but I had reservations going in because one of the bosses above him had a reputation (I figured I'd only stay 2Yor so). ANYWAY - I got in, and found out that BOTH firm owners were problematic - sexist, played favourites, flogged the high performers, covered for the underperformers and then held back on bonuses because underperformers weren't pulling their weight, etc. 

Another woman in my industry, 40F, was a good friend of one of said bosses (although she said she knew his flaws and would hate to work for him). Anyway, she and I also met socially - we're both women of colour, and sometimes you need to share intel - heard a few of my stories - but chose to join the firm anyway when her own consultancy (a PwC spinoff), started layoffs. 

She was the same level as me (associate director), but got to come in as a director without proving anything. Whereas I'd actually been acting in a director capacity, outperformed most of the directors except my own boss, and was given higher performance targets than actual Partners in order to...get this...go for a Director role. Talk about moving goalposts, inequitable treatment, and favouritism.

To note: I actually don't hold this against her. The firm boss is a sexist pig, he really wanted her in there because she plays the girl game better than I ever will and makes him feel good about himself, and if she exploited that for a $50K salary jump and a title that sets her up for future roles...? Good on her. Unfortunately I suck at that game: I'm just good enough and professional enough that people panick when I resign, even if they don't like me - makes me hard to fire.  

Anyway, I'd been chipping away at getting into this organisation I'd been passionate about working with - they're highly dysfunctional, but they're also at the frontlines of climate change adaptation, and I wanted to get in there and understand how they're tackling some of the extreme impacts of Australian climate change on their assets. I'd finally gotten into the organisation as an embedded resource, helping them with their projects and setting up frameworks while they recruit long-term.

They are FREAKING dysfunctional. It's an American high school cafeteria and Game of Thrones in there \*at the same time\*. Anyway, I managed to open the door for her and another colleague to also work with that client.

Turns out that she had a friend in there, another lady. 

I've had two conversations with this lady, but I will say that I don't think that much of her. This lady had been around 6 months, brought in as a super senior leader, and spent a lot of time giving powerpoints saying she was going to do XYZ... then six months later, whinging she didn't have people and support. Lady refuses to even do her own excels - apparently she'd rather wait 6 months to hire someone to do it for her. (Again, I'd sympathise, but EVERYONE in this organisation has too much on, and not enough team members - whether you like it or not, you have to roll up your sleeves a bit.). 

Anyway, this lady told 40F that in her opinion I wasn't Project Director material. I'm impressed how this lady knew so much about my performance based on two conversations with me, the fact I'm 5:2, and the fact I wore a cardigan in one of my coffees with her. 

Sidebar: The Projects I'm working on are complicated messes that are being dealt with discretely, which, as a result, don't have a lot of exposure in the organisation. A lot of people I talk to in the corridors or the lift don't really see me in action, so I'm not surprised they don't have much to say about me, even when they're told I'm a Project Director. All I'll say is that people from 3 different divisions now call me directly when they have a gnarly problem, and I managed to turn around what was looking to be an environmental disaster, so I'll be my own advocate here. 

Anyway, this is really about what happened next. 

40F then...went to my boss. The one I'd told her stories about (over a year before I found she was planning to join - not the one who was her friend). One I'd frankly warned her about, one woman of colour to another, when she wanted a second opinion of him. To pass on the rumour about her super insightful intel about how someone in the client environment felt I wasn't up to the task of my job.  I don't know exactly when this happened, but at least 6 weeks before her last day is my guess.

By this point - I'd stayed out of my home base politics - I found out my line manager felt that 40Y was underperforming - disappearing for hours on end, late on deliverables, constantly whinging to the admin officer that the men didn't understand how hard it was for her to pick up their expertise and they needed to afford her more leeway. I don't know how bad it was personally - TL:DR, she didn't make her probation, and it ended with a sour taste in everyone's mouths. My perspective is that, while she definitely was underperforming, it wasn't worse than two of the existing male employees, so all the hostility about her performance is a bit meh to me. 

A week after, I caught up with my line manager (the one who hired me in), and he told me that our boss brought that story to him. Apparently her playing bitchy private girls school games brought her down worse in their eyes than me being single, childless, and not a fawning secretary. He warned me to be careful with her in future if we were to stay in touch.

40Y asked to catch up with me this week, two days before I found out about all this. I'd turned her down because I was sick, and now I'm \*very\* reluctant to reschedule anything. 

So, the am I overreacting question:

I do a thing where I rate how badly a person has treated me in a professional environment, and categorise them into lists: 

1. Those I'd deny my personal reference and would not willingly hire, and withdraw favours from, but I wouldn't publicise it and 

2. Those who I'd actively verbally downrate to trusted colleagues, to sabotage their hiring chances, and 

3. Those I'd politely trash to \*anyone\* who asks me about her (Note, you only scathingly downrate if \*asked\*. A lady with class does not volunteer this shit). I'm not broadly known in industry, but people who know me know I'm a straight shooter: when I verbally thumbs down someone, they listen. I've only used this power twice, and both times that person got fired. 

Arguably, what she did didn't affect me that much. I should only put her in category 1, where I politely turn down coffees, catch up once a year in group settings. And, if she pushes hard for a favour, bring up the incident directly and see what happens.

But I also question what I'd done to try and get her to trash me to my boss (imply the client might not like me, and give him incentive to switch me out). If she genuinely cared about my rep, why didn't she tell \*me\* someone in my client environment was trash talking me? Was she trying to distract my bosses from honing in on her performance by siccing them on another female target?

I never once trashed her to my bosses, and when they debated bringing her on there was concerns about bringing in another female director, when everyone knew I was angling for a promotion - a whole bunch of bullshit, what, we have a female director quota? - I advocated for her.  

Women in the workplace don't have to be allies in all things, or even like each other, but there are somethings you shouldn't fuck around on whether you like each other or not. I guess I'm pissed she didn't reciprocate the level of integrity I felt I gave her. 

And I want to shove her in category 3 because of that.

My version of category 3 for her is, if anyone asks, I tell them she plays high school girl games when it comes to other women, and use the example of how she kept moaning to the admin officer (knowing the officer was the wife of my manager), hoping admin officer would lobby her husband (my manager) on 40Fs behalf. Not like I'm hunting her down to ruin her life, but if that story gets out it's a character smear that makes her look laughable.

Customer service through Keurig has proven more irritating than it is useless, which is pretty amazing. Their technical service team have no idea and probably haven‚Äôt used their products and just read from a script.

My keurig has started leaking water (not brewed coffee) around the bottom rim of the basket when it is brewing either a pod or a thermal carafe of coffee. I have cleaned it out at descaled it, but this still seems to be the case. 

My initial presumption was The penetrating hole from the pod holder was becoming clogged, and the water was overflowing the pod holder and down into the basket. However, cleaning that out did not resolve it and when brewing a pot, I also get this leakage, which, unfortunately, being on the very outer rim of the bottom of the basket leaks down the outside of the carafe.

When your service desk lives in a portal that feels prehistoric, every quiet week is still a headache. What if you could swap out that clunky system‚Äîmid-contract‚Äîand never pay for it again?

Why Legacy ITSM Stalls Your Summer?

Legacy platforms weren‚Äôt built for a world of instant messaging, hybrid work and real-time SLA expectations. Instead, they deliver:
‚Ä¢	Endless form-filling and drop-downs
‚Ä¢	Manual triage that never stops
‚Ä¢	24‚Äì48-hour response times that tank productivity

Even when ticket volume dips, your team‚Äôs stuck firefighting low-value tasks, burning through PTO days on support.

Key Features in a Modern ITSM

A next-gen service desk should feel invisible‚Äîbecause it lives where you already work: Slack and Microsoft Teams. Look for:
‚Ä¢	Conversational AI: Auto-resolve password resets, access requests and basic installs
‚Ä¢	No-Code Automations: Drag, drop and connect workflows in minutes
‚Ä¢	Actionable Analytics: Dashboards that pinpoint ticket trends and knowledge gaps
‚Ä¢	Enterprise-Grade Security: ISO/GDPR/HIPAA compliance and data loss prevention
‚Ä¢	Multilingual Support: Global reach without extra complexity

What Keeps Teams Locked In

Long-term contracts, migration fears and double-billing anxiety make switching feel impossible. Even if the promise of automation is real, the risk of downtime‚Äîor paying two vendors at once‚Äîoften outweighs the benefits in everyone‚Äôs mind.

Up for a Summer Trade-In? 
 
Rezolve.ai has turned ‚Äúswap‚Äù into a no-brainer:
‚Ä¢	Contract Offset: We cover all overlapping months, so you don‚Äôt get charged twice
‚Ä¢	Complimentary DeskIQ Assessment: A $25 000-value audit of hidden inefficiencies

‚Ä¢	Built-In AI in Slack/Microsoft Teams: Your employees get instant help without learning a new app

I go there every one‚Äôs in a while when I‚Äòm in town with my girlfriend, like very 6 months.

Before I could react he asked me ‚ÄûWhat do you even know about fragrances like this? What do you know about Blonde Amber?‚Äú He also asked me who I thought I was to try his fragrances in his store and then assumed I‚Äôd just to buy them online. I was stunned lol, like I didn‚Äòt even know what to say. Mind you I already bought a fragrance from them in the past. He then asked me what kind of fragrances I own and I told him a few (said Gris Charnel, Apple Brandy, MFK, some Xerjoffs‚Ä¶) and than he said that he hadn‚Äôt meant it in a mean way. I still didn‚Äòt know what to say lmao, normally I‚Äôm very quick to say something but I was so shocked that I just awkwardly followed a quick conversation with him. I was very excited and wanted to test a few more scents, however my mood changed quickly after the first comment. My girlfriend was shocked as well and told me that she could hear his rude comments from across the store. We left the store and to be honest, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever go back.

I got it recently and start using it during my trip in Asia. Of course, I'm aware of the time it gets to season the burrs, I grind like 500gr in total, but the coffee wasn't the best (a blend of speciality coffee from blue tokai in India and some arabica in vietnam form okkai; and the rest was fine robusta)

The point here is I recently bought some coffee from local roaster in Uruguay, is medium-light roast, a washed coffee from Colombia and some natural processed from Brazil. I made some v60 withsome Lance Hedrick technique and Im really trying to figure out the difference. I know it's not the same but I find extremely difficult to notice whats the difference? Its been said this grinder shines at lighter roast, its a clean cup, and for real I ""notice"" that but I don't notice the BIG difference y'know? Maybe its the coffe I use? My technique? The water? My palate? I want to read your thoughts about it, advices, whatever. I don't regret at all buying this grinder since part of my joinment is doing blind tests, comparing between grinders, and of course I leave the other for espresso. I'll leave the coffees below if you are interested in them :)

P.D. I know it's not the best for natural processed coffees, but Im having a cup of the brazil one and it actually tastes great :) more mysterious...

1kikz6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1kikz6c/im_tired_of_my_family_treating_me_like_an_outsider/,I‚Äôm tired of my family treating me like an outsider.,"I‚Äôm f19, and I moved away from my hometown 2 years ago for college. I was first living in the hostel and then shifted to an apartment with my sister (26f). 

Now gharse, we get 15,000‚Çπ per month which is strictly for household expenses. First few months after moving here were okay and smooth. But since the past 4 months, my sister started living back in our hometown. She hasn‚Äôt moved out from this house. But she‚Äôs just staying at both places. 

My sister used to have a job which she quit recently so she has no obligation or necessity to return back to this city where I am. However, she still comes back for a few days here and there.

Now the thing is, since the past 4 months, I have been paying for everything even when my sister is here and even when she‚Äôs not. When she went to our hometown the first time, she turned the milk subscription off and told me that it was a mistake. Then when I confronted her because it still didn‚Äôt come after that, she told me to manage on my own because I‚Äôm living alone. And before this also, she has turned the subscription off many times. Whenever she would leave the house, she would turn the subscription off. I fought a bit but then I was like okay I‚Äôll see myself only.

Anyways, since these past 4 months, I have been paying for everything. Before this, we would split the expenses, she would pay for some things and I would pay for others. But now, I am paying for everything because I am living alone. Which is valid. But my family still gives her the same allowance even tho she is living with them only. Everything is already paid for, so why does she need the entire allowance? This is something I don‚Äôt understand at all.

Leaving that aside, whenever she will come back to this house, she expects everything to be clean, everything to be in place, coffee should be made for her, there should be extra milk, WiFi should be paid for (I don‚Äôt pay for it because I don‚Äôt use it much and I‚Äôm living alone so why pay extra for it when I have my data). And what bothers me a lot is, that she will manipulate me into paying for the things. She will say that she wasn‚Äôt here the entire time, so if I have consumed something I should only pay for it when she wants it. For example, if I drank milk when she was gone (yes we fought over this), then when she comes back I should be paying for it. But bro, she didn‚Äôt pay for it even when she wasn‚Äôt here. So according to her logic, if I want to consume something, I should pay for it. But if she wants to consume something, even then I should pay for it because I was the one who finished it in the first place. üòÅ

I have a job and college too so I leave home at 9 am and come back at 9 pm. And it is very hard to keep the entire house together. I usually clean on the weekends. But when she comes back, she will ask me to do her laundry and send it for ironing too. But won‚Äôt pay the iron guy. :) 

I recently raised this concern that she‚Äôs not contributing anything and just sitting on the money that is being given to us by our family and she told me that she will not be contributing because I am living here alone. 

I am stuck here. Paying for groceries, milk, the help, water, ironing, wifi, etc. it consumes almost 60% of my allowance and I have nothing left for myself because the other part goes into travel from home to office to college to home. I spend almost 200-300‚Çπ each day in travel. 

Whenever she comes back, she will order the most expensive meal and expect me to split it. And if she is hungry and I‚Äôm not, she won‚Äôt eat unless I do just so we can split it later on. And it frustrates the fuck out of me. 

I have explained this to my mom many times but she always demands to see my payment history and everything. Which I have showed her countless times to prove that I am spending only on necessities. I can‚Äôt keep showing it everything month because it is very tiring and intrusive. 

Even when there are repairs to be done at home, like my sister‚Äôs room‚Äôs AC or shower, I have to pay for it. It has come to such a point that I‚Äôm having just one meal per day and rest of the day I‚Äôm surviving on liquids. I‚Äôm unable to even get basic hygiene stuff for myself. I used to be a huge skincare girlie. And I feel so ashamed that now I‚Äôm not even able to buy basic shampoo and conditioner. So I use all the left over things that my sister has left back here. 

On the other hand, she orders really expensive items for herself because she has managed saving up so much by staying with my parents. I can‚Äôt even order many groceries because they will go to waste as I‚Äôm the only one consuming them, so I rely on packaged food. 

I have raised this concern with my mom many times but she doesn‚Äôt understand, I texted her a long message explaining again today, but she never replied. Left me on seen. 

Since the past 3 weeks, I have been sick because I haven‚Äôt been eating properly, but there is no one to rely on here because I live alone. It is vacation now. So my friends have gone back to their family. But I have a job so I can‚Äôt go home. Idk what to do. My mom knows all this, she knows I‚Äôve been sick, but there‚Äôs still no answer from her end. I love her a lot, I do, but sometimes she makes me feel very alone. 

I have done my best to manage and see where and when I can cut some expenses, mostly I take rapido bike for the same. But as I return late at night, my family doesn‚Äôt allow for bikes and urges that I go in rickshaw. 

 I am trying my best to be independent from my family so they don‚Äôt have to pay for me. But even now, when I have a job they are forcing me to quit it. Without understanding why I‚Äôm doing it. ",5,1746803705.0,OffMyChestIndia,6,1.0,False

1kikv3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1kikv3y/my_nursing_journey_from_dreams_to_rn/,My Nursing Journey: From Dreams to RN,"After finally completing a major milestone in my journey last month, I felt compelled to write down and share my story. Sometimes putting your experiences into words helps make sense of the path you've traveled. This is going to be a long one, so grab your coffee (or something stronger!), and settle in.

## The Seed Was Planted

Growing up, I never thought I'd end up in nursing. My mom was a teacher and my dad worked in IT, so healthcare wasn't really on my radar. But during my junior year of high school (2015), my grandmother had a stroke and spent several weeks in the hospital. That's when I first witnessed the magic of nursing.

There was this one nurse, Elaine, who made such an impact on both my grandmother and our family. She wasn't just providing medical care - she was offering emotional support, explaining complex medical jargon in ways we could understand, and treating my grandmother with such dignity and respect. I remember thinking, ""I want to be that person for someone else someday.""

## The Winding Path

After high school, I actually started college as a business major (facepalm). I spent my freshman year pretending to be interested in marketing classes while secretly watching nurse vloggers on YouTube. By sophomore year, I couldn't ignore the pull anymore and switched to pre-nursing.

The science prerequisites hit me like a truck! Chemistry almost broke me - I'd never been great at science, and suddenly I was drowning in molecular structures and equations. I still have nightmares about the periodic table, lol. I failed my first chem exam spectacularly (43%, still hurts to type that number). But I found an amazing study group, spent countless hours in the tutoring center, and somehow pulled through with a B-.

Anatomy and Physiology became my unexpected love affair. Something about mapping out the human body and understanding how everything interconnects just clicked for me. My A&P professor became my first mentor - shoutout to Dr. Ramirez who saw potential in me when I was still doubting myself.

## The Application Process (aka The Hunger Games)

Spring 2019 was application season. For those of you who haven't experienced this special form of torture, let me paint the picture: hundreds of students competing for about 60 spots, obsessing over every decimal point in their GPA, practicing TEAS test questions while brushing teeth, and manically refreshing emails.

My nursing school had a 3.7 GPA minimum requirement, and I was sitting at a 3.68 after that chemistry fiasco. I retook an elective course during winter session to bump it up to 3.71. Barely made the cut!

The interview process was its own beast. I practiced answers to potential questions for weeks, had my roommates drill me with mock interviews, and still walked in feeling like I was going to pass out. Pro tip: The ""tell me about a time you failed"" question isn't a trap - they genuinely want to hear about your resilience.

When the acceptance email came, I literally screamed so loud that my downstairs neighbor texted to ask if I was okay.

## Nursing School: The Reality Show

Fall 2019: Started nursing school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. By midterms, the bags under my eyes had their own bags.

The first clinical rotation was at a long-term care facility. I was terrified of hurting someone or making a mistake. My hands shook so badly trying to take my first blood pressure that my patient gently patted my arm and said, ""Honey, are you sure you're in the right profession?"" I was devastated and cried the whole way home. My roommate, seeing how crushed I was, surprised me with a little care package the next day - a coffee mug from this brand called Bbobbler with ""Future Nurse"" printed on it and some chocolate. That small gesture meant everything when I was at my lowest. (Plot twist: that same patient later told me I'd make a wonderful nurse and I still tear up thinking about it).

Then came the infamous med-surg rotation. For those who haven't experienced it yet, just imagine trying to drink from a firehose while simultaneously juggling flaming torches. You're responsible for knowing hundreds of medications, disease processes, nursing interventions, and somehow must develop the time management skills of a superhero.

I failed my first major exam and had a complete meltdown in my car afterward. Called my mom sobbing that I wasn't cut out for this. She listened patiently and then said, ""So you're giving up after one bad test? That doesn't sound like you."" Tough love, exactly what I needed.

## The COVID Curveball

March 2020 - just as I was hitting my stride in nursing school, COVID turned everything upside down. Classes went online, clinical sites closed, and suddenly we were learning nursing skills via Zoom. My school scrambled to create virtual simulations, but let's be honest - practicing IV insertions on an orange at your kitchen table just isn't the same.

Fall 2020 was a bizarre mix of online theory classes and limited in-person skills labs with full PPE. I've never been so grateful for the opportunity to practice a catheter insertion on a mannequin!

When we finally returned to clinical settings in 2021, healthcare had transformed. Our preceptors were exhausted but still found energy to teach us. Watching nurses rise to the challenge of the pandemic while continuing to provide compassionate care solidified my career choice.

## The Final Push

Senior year (2021-2022) brought its own challenges. The infamous ""transition to practice"" course that everyone warns you about? It's as intense as they say. 12-hour clinical shifts back-to-back with academic assignments due the same day should be classified as cruel and unusual punishment.

Preparing for NCLEX became my part-time job. I had question banks on my phone and reviewed them during lunch breaks, waiting in line at the grocery store, even while brushing my teeth. My friends and family learned to accept that random medical facts had become my primary form of conversation.

My capstone project focused on nurse burnout prevention strategies - ironic considering I was simultaneously experiencing burnout from studying burnout! But that project actually sparked my interest in nurse wellness and eventually shaped my career path.

## Plot Twist: Life After Graduation

I graduated in May 2022 with my BSN, passed the NCLEX on my first try (with 75 questions exactly - I nearly had a heart attack when it shut off so quickly), and landed my first job on a medical-surgical floor. Just like everyone said, the transition from student to full-fledged RN was ROUGH.

That first year as a new grad was humbling. I cried in the bathroom during shifts, questioned my abilities daily, and seriously considered leaving the profession at least once a month. But slowly, imperceptibly at first, things started to click. I began to develop my own workflow, recognize patterns, and trust my instincts.

After a year on med-surg, I transferred to the PACU (Post-Anesthesia Care Unit) and found my niche. The controlled chaos, the critical thinking required for post-op patients, and the satisfaction of helping people through their most vulnerable moments - it all clicked.

## Back to School Again

Just when I thought I was done with school forever, the education bug bit me again. In fall 2023, I started a part-time MSN program focusing on nursing education. Working full-time while studying is a special kind of challenge, but I'm passionate about eventually teaching the next generation of nurses.

The program should take me about three years to complete, so I'll be finished in 2026 if all goes according to plan. Currently juggling clinical hours, research projects, and my regular PACU shifts - some days I'm not sure how I'm still standing!

## Where I Am Today

Fast forward to May 2025 (today!), and I'm three years into my nursing career with one year left in my MSN program. I've found my stride in the PACU, developed confidence in my skills, and even started precepting new grads (talk about coming full circle!).

Last month, I presented my first research poster at a regional nursing conference on strategies to improve nurse retention in acute care settings. Standing there, explaining my findings to seasoned nurses and educators, I had this surreal moment of: ""How did I get here? When did I become a real nurse?""

The challenges haven't disappeared. Healthcare is still struggling with staffing issues, burnout is real, and some days are harder than others. But I've built resilience I never knew I had, and I've found purpose in this profession that goes beyond a paycheck.

## Lessons Learned Along the Way

For those of you still in school or just starting your nursing journey, here are some things I wish someone had told me:

1. **It's okay to not know everything.** Ask questions, even if you think they're stupid. Better to feel momentarily embarrassed than to make a preventable mistake.

2. **Find your people.** My nursing school study group became my lifeline. We still have a group chat where we vent, celebrate wins, and ask for advice.

3. **Self-care isn't selfish.** You cannot pour from an empty cup. Schedule your rest days like you schedule your work days - with intention.

4. **Comparison is the thief of joy.** Some people grasp concepts immediately, others need more time. Your journey is your own.

5. **Nurses eat their young"" doesn't have to be true.** Be the change. Support those coming after you.

6. **You will make mistakes.** Everyone does. It's how you handle them and what you learn that matters.

7. **Trust your gut.** If something feels wrong, it probably is. Speak up, even when it's uncomfortable.


Once I finish my MSN, I'd like to split my time between clinical practice and teaching. The dream is to work three days in PACU and two days as a clinical instructor. I'm particularly interested in helping address the nursing shortage by mentoring new nurses and reducing first-year turnover rates.

I've also become involved with our hospital's wellness committee, helping implement resilience training and mindfulness practices for staff. It's a small contribution, but if it helps even one nurse avoid burnout, it's worth it.

On a personal note, I just started training for my first half-marathon (pray for me, my poor knees are already protesting!). Turns out all those 12-hour shifts have actually been good preparation for endurance events.


If you've made it this far in my rambling life story, thank you for reading! Finding others who understand the unique struggles and triumphs of this profession has been an incredible source of support, humor, and reality checks throughout my journey. Those late-night online conversations with fellow nursing students and professionals helped me laugh during study breaks and provided honest perspectives about the challenges we all face.

Nursing isn't just what I do - it's become part of who I am. Despite the challenges, the exhaustion, and the days when I question my career choice, I can't imagine doing anything else. Well, except maybe on those days when all my patients' IV pumps decide to alarm simultaneously...



Stay strong, nursing friends. Your work matters more than you know.

Because House is right, him still yawning while high on stimulants indicates it's symptomatic. Also I suppose it would be harder to just get pills without having a diagnosis for them, even for a doctor.

We come from very different families. I have a small family‚Äîjust my mom and brother. My dad disappeared overseas when I was 17, and we‚Äôve never been close with extended family. My fianc√©‚Äôs family, on the other hand, is large, tight-knit, and full of¬†*expectations*. Holidays, reunions, family dinners, extended-family trips‚Äîyou name it, we‚Äôre expected to be there. And we are. More than any of his three brothers, honestly.

The expectations don‚Äôt stop with blood relatives. His mom‚Äôs best friend has three sons around the same age as my fianc√© and his brothers, and they‚Äôre basically treated like family. His mom has even said to my fianc√© that her and this family is ""a package deal"" for me. We‚Äôre expected to attend their events, vacations, even made-up holidays with this family. I don‚Äôt really connect with them‚Äîthey‚Äôre very wealthy and, in my opinion, out of touch‚Äîbut I‚Äôve still shown up often.

I‚Äôm very introverted but I showed love in the ways I know how. I gave thoughtful gifts for every birthday, Mother‚Äôs Day, Christmas. Many times I was the¬†*only*¬†one who got them gifts, and they even recognized this by mentioning it to their sons. There have been times when my birthday has fallen on Fathers Day, and I would spent it celebrating his father, even getting him a gift-- despite how hard that day is for me. I always tried to show up and be thoughtful, even when it was hard.

When we lived three hours away, his mom would visit a beach town just 30 minutes from us‚Äîbut never once visited or saw our first apartment. That hurt, but I let it go. Then I got a job closer to where they live, and they graciously let us stay with them while we saved for an apartment. I was always vocal about my gratitude. But the stay itself‚Ä¶ was rough. Any of my belongings outside our room were moved back in. They didn‚Äôt like how I washed dishes. They didn‚Äôt like that I took baths. I work 40‚Äì50 hours a week as a social worker at a nursing home, with a 45-minute commute. My fianc√© worked 20 hours a week at a local restaurant five minutes away.

We were also planning our wedding at the time. I initially wanted something small‚Äîjust us and immediate family. His mom said her sisters would be devastated to not be in attendance, so I started planning a 150-person wedding. I tried to include her: invited her to venue tours (she was always busy or too tired), asked her and my mom to be ring bearers, and told her I wanted her there when I tried on dresses. She‚Äôd often say she felt left out of her oldest son‚Äôs wedding, and I didn‚Äôt want her to feel that way again.

Then one day, my fianc√© told me his dad had taken him out for coffee and said he didn‚Äôt think we should get married until our finances were ‚Äúin order.‚Äù I make $70k a year at 23. We‚Äôre not wealthy, but we‚Äôre stable. I was really bothered that¬†*our*¬†wedding was being discussed behind my back.

We‚Äôd decided to do a joint bachelor/bachelorette weekend and sent out the date to our wedding party. One of his brothers said he couldn‚Äôt make it and started suggesting alternate dates‚Äîlike it was his to reschedule. I was already feeling small in this family dynamic.

Then came the Instagram story incident. I posted a photo on my private story of our cat sleeping in his youngest brother‚Äôs bed (he was away at college). A few days later, during a family gathering, his mom said loudly in front of everyone, ‚ÄúDid you post a picture of the cat in (younger brother‚Äôs) bed? Maybe don‚Äôt do that again. He mentioned it to me.‚Äù I was mortified. Why not just message me? Why say it in front of everyone?

We eventually found our own apartment and moved out while his parents were out of town. Two weeks later, we adopted a kitten‚Äîthe same weekend as his mom‚Äôs birthday dinner. We didn‚Äôt attend the dinner because we were setting up the apartment and helping the kitten adjust. That lit a match.

His dad¬†*showed up to my fianc√©‚Äôs job*‚Äîthe same restaurant he worked at while we lived with them‚Äîand¬†**berated**him in public. He said:

* I was the reason my fianc√© left a¬†**five-day bachelor party**¬†early (this was for¬†his mom‚Äôs best friend‚Äôs son, not even a family member),
* We skipped part of the¬†**four-day wedding**¬†for that same family (we only missed the brunch the day after, we attended the pre-party, wedding, reception, and after-party),
* It was rude¬†*I*¬†didn‚Äôt buy a gift for them after staying in their house (not their son‚Äî*me*).
* He then brought up a joke I had made on my private Snapchat story, claiming I was degrading my fianc√©. When I asked my fianc√© about it, he said he didn‚Äôt feel that way at all‚Äîhe actually thought it was funny. His parents don‚Äôt even have Snapchat, so clearly one of his brothers or another family member saw it and chose to bring it up behind my back.

This happened¬†*in public*, at his job, where I also know the staff, I am friends with the owner, and many regulars. I was humiliated.

I texted his mom, asking if we could talk. She said she didn‚Äôt want to discuss anything she wasn‚Äôt present for. So I asked both parents if we could all four meet and talk about boundaries and work through any issues we had. Her response?

""Thanks for reaching out. I am good with my boundaries and behaviors ‚Äì and that is the only thing I have control over so I don‚Äôt need to meet as a group.‚Äù

So we decided to have the wedding we wanted. We are getting married just us two at a local court house, now two months earlier than the original date. We didn't tell may people about the new date, but somehow it still got back to his parents. His mom told him she was upset she had to ""find things out through other people"".

Eventually, his mom called me. I calmly told her I didn‚Äôt appreciate being talked about behind my back, or having my social media policed. Her response? ‚ÄúSocial media is public information.‚Äù I said we often feel anxious saying no to plans because of the reaction. She said she was hurt I didn‚Äôt get her a gift for letting us live there, and that I didn‚Äôt come back to clean (again,¬†*my fianc√© did the cleaning*, per our agreement, since he worked 20 hours a week five minutes away from their home and I worked up to 50 45 minutes away).

Now I feel like I‚Äôm at a crossroads. I don‚Äôt think my fianc√© sees how toxic and emotionally manipulative this dynamic has become. He says he supports me, but I don‚Äôt see enough¬†*anger*¬†from him. I feel like I‚Äôm the only one drawing boundaries and getting punished for it.

His parents also regularly complain about the oldest brother and his wife ‚Äúkeeping‚Äù their grandchild from them. They mock the ""rules"" they have regarding their children (for example, they asked them not to kiss them when they were infants). They act entitled to time and access with no regard for others‚Äô space or capacity. And now that same controlling behavior is being turned on me.

I feel completely drained. I don't know what to do or how to proceed. My fianc√© does not seem to fully the grasp the gravity of their behavior. ",1,1746803126.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1kikqd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1kikqd8/hacks_to_increase_your_protein_intake_in_your/,"Hacks to increase your protein intake in your average Indian pure vegetarian diet (macros included) without adding whey or anything fancy like oats, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, quinoa etc."," Full macro breakdown is at the end of the post. Stepwise macro breakdown is included in each step.

It is a misconception that Indian food lacks protein. Indian food has enough protein options. It's just that you are not making the correct choices. Obviously, a diet of dal, rajma etc is not going to be as protein rich as a diet full of fish, chicken, meat and eggs, but you can easily get 100 grams of protein per day with your average Indian food items just by following these simple hacks:

#1. Eat better carb sources

Most vegetarian protein sources have a lot of carbs. So replace your main carb sources with protein rich carb sources. For example, if you are eating 3 rotis and 1 bowl of dal, eat 2 rotis and 2 bowls of dal. If you eat more rice than rajma/chhole whenever your mom prepares rajma/chhole-chawal, start consuming more rajma/chhole than rice.

You can almost double your protein intake in a meal by following this step.

Macros for 2 multigrain rotis in lunch:

P: 7.5 g

F: 2 g

C: 40 g


#2. Eat mix dal instead of only 1 dal.

Each and every variety of dal has different macro and micro profile. Also since we know that most vegetarian protein sources are incomplete protein sources (they don't have all 9 essential amino acids), mixing 2-3 types of dal can fix this issue. 

Also you can have a different mixture everyday.

Make sure to have atleast 1 serving of mix dal per day. Dinner time is the best time to have it imo. 

Macros per bowl :

P: 8

F : 2

C : 20


#3. Make besan cheela a staple breakfast.

Besan cheela is a very quick and easy to make recipe which is very customisable too. Grate some paneer on top for extra protein. Have it with one 250 gram serving of curd.

3 besan cheelas with 250 grams of curd and a handful of nuts like almonds, cashews, walnuts etc is enough to give you 30+ grams of protein with a lot of healthy fats.

For variety, you can have moong dal cheela and besan cheela on alternate days. 

Macros for 3 cheelas:

P: 20 g

F: 10 g

C: 45 g

Macros for one handfull of mixed nuts :

P: 5 g

F: 20 g

C: 5 g
 
Macros for 250 gram low fat curd:

P: 10 g

F: 4 g

C: 10 g

Total approx breakfast macros = 35 gram protein,  25 gram fat, 60 gram carbs.

#4. Consume atleast 500 ml of milk and 500 g curd per day.

Dairy is one of the only complete sources of protein for vegetarians. So try to include as much as you can. Most Indians are not lactose intolerant. If you are, go for lactose free dairy.

500 ml of milk will give you roughly 15 grams of protein and 500 gram of curd will give you roughly 20 grams of protein. That is 35 grams of high quality protein without doing anything at all. 

You can  break it down into multiple servings. For example, I have 250 grams of curd in breakfast and 250 grams in lunch. 

You can break down 500 ml of milk into 2 servings of 250 ml. First serving of 250 ml can be further broken down into multiple servings of tea and coffee that we usually have and then one glass of 250 ml turmeric latte (haldi wala doodh) before you sleep along with a handful of nuts like almonds, walnuts etc to finish your day.

You can have low fat or skimmed dairy if you are cautious about calories and saturated fat content.

Macros for 500 ml skimmed milk:

P: 15 g

F: 1 g

C: 25 g

Macros for 250 gram low fat curd:

P: 10 g

F: 4 g

C: 10 g

Total approx macros from dairy = 35 g protein, 10 g fats, 45 g carbs (includes breakfast curd also)


#5. Switch to mutigrain atta

You can either purchase multigrain atta from the market or you can purchase whole grains in the ratio you prefer and get the atta made by your local atta mill.

I add an equal mixture of kala chana, bajra, raagi, soya chunks and maize flour (2 kg each so a total of 10 kg) with 15 kg of wheat to make a total of 25 kg multigrain atta. This hack alone will add roughly 5-10 grams of protein per day depending on how many rotis you consume without any extra effort at all.

Macros for 2 multigrain rotis in dinner:

P: 7.5 g

F: 2 g

C: 40 g


#6. Better snacks

Snack on roasted chana, kala chana chaat, boiled chickpea chaat, sprouts etc.

Approx macros per serve roughly 50 grams (varies with item of choice) :

P: 10 g

F: 5 g

C: 30 g


#Ending notes

By following these hacks you can easily reach 100 grams of protein per day. Yes it's not as good as eating chicken or eggs but not everyone can eat such foods due to various reasons. 

30 gram high protein breakfast, 35 grams protein from dairy, 10 grams protein from snacks, roughly 25 grams of protein from 2 servings of dal/rajma/chhole along with multi grain roti is enough to give you 90 grams of protein per day.

You can add 100 grams of paneer randomly here and there per day to take this number to 100+. 

Macros for 100 gram paneer:

P: 16 g

F: 22 g

C: 5 g


Also don't get me wrong. I have nothing against oats or the fancy stuff like chia seeds, pumpkin seeds etc. I myself consume things like oats, muesli, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds etc. This post was just an attempt to show that it is possible to have a high protein diet by just eating staple indian foods.

Total macros per day approx:

P: 105

F: 65

C: 220

E: 1885 kcal

The macros are from the example foods mentioned above for illustration purposes only on how to get 100+ grams of protein from average Indian diet. You will obviously add sabzis, use oil/ghee for cooking which will increase the carbs and fats.

I work 40‚Äì50 hours a week as a social worker at a nursing home, with a 45-minute commute. My fianc√© worked 20 hours a week at a local restaurant five minutes away.

We were also planning our wedding at the time. I initially wanted something small‚Äîjust us and immediate family. His mom said her sisters would be devastated to not be in attendance, so I started planning a 150-person wedding. I tried to include her: invited her to venue tours (she was always busy or too tired), asked her and my mom to be ring bearers, and told her I wanted her there when I tried on dresses. She‚Äôd often say she felt left out of her oldest son‚Äôs wedding, and I didn‚Äôt want her to feel that way again.

Then one day, my fianc√© told me his dad had taken him out for coffee and said he didn‚Äôt think we should get married until our finances were ‚Äúin order.‚Äù I make $70k a year at 23. We‚Äôre not wealthy, but we‚Äôre stable. I was really bothered that¬†*our*¬†wedding was being discussed behind my back.

We‚Äôd decided to do a joint bachelor/bachelorette weekend and sent out the date to our wedding party. One of his brothers said he couldn‚Äôt make it and started suggesting alternate dates‚Äîlike it was his to reschedule. I was already feeling small in this family dynamic.

Then came the Instagram story incident. I posted a photo on my private story of our cat sleeping in his youngest brother‚Äôs bed (he was away at college). A few days later, during a family gathering, his mom said loudly in front of everyone, ‚ÄúDid you post a picture of the cat in (younger brother‚Äôs) bed? Maybe don‚Äôt do that again. He mentioned it to me.‚Äù I was mortified. Why not just message me? Why say it in front of everyone?

We eventually found our own apartment and moved out while his parents were out of town. Two weeks later, we adopted a kitten‚Äîthe same weekend as his mom‚Äôs birthday dinner. We didn‚Äôt attend the dinner because we were setting up the apartment and helping the kitten adjust. That lit a match.

His dad¬†*showed up to my fianc√©‚Äôs job*‚Äîthe same restaurant he worked at while we lived with them‚Äîand¬†**berated**him in public. He said:

* I was the reason my fianc√© left a¬†**five-day bachelor party**¬†early (this was for¬†his mom‚Äôs best friend‚Äôs son, not even a family member),
* We skipped part of the¬†**four-day wedding**¬†for that same family (we only missed the brunch the day after, we attended the pre-party, wedding, reception, and after-party),
* It was rude¬†*I*¬†didn‚Äôt buy a gift for them after staying in their house (not their son‚Äî*me*).
* He then brought up a joke I had made on my private Snapchat story, claiming I was degrading my fianc√©. When I asked my fianc√© about it, he said he didn‚Äôt feel that way at all‚Äîhe actually thought it was funny. His parents don‚Äôt even have Snapchat, so clearly one of his brothers or another family member saw it and chose to bring it up behind my back.

This happened¬†*in public*, at his job, where I also know the staff, I am friends with the owner, and many regulars. I was humiliated.

I texted his mom, asking if we could talk. She said she didn‚Äôt want to discuss anything she wasn‚Äôt present for. So I asked both parents if we could all four meet and talk about boundaries and work through any issues we had. Her response?

""Thanks for reaching out. I am good with my boundaries and behaviors ‚Äì and that is the only thing I have control over so I don‚Äôt need to meet as a group.‚Äù

So we decided to have the wedding we wanted. We are getting married just us two at a local court house, now two months earlier than the original date. We didn't tell may people about the new date, but somehow it still got back to his parents. His mom told him she was upset she had to ""find things out through other people"".

Eventually, his mom called me. I calmly told her I didn‚Äôt appreciate being talked about behind my back, or having my social media policed. Her response? ‚ÄúSocial media is public information.‚Äù I said we often feel anxious saying no to plans because of the reaction. She said she was hurt I didn‚Äôt get her a gift for letting us live there, and that I didn‚Äôt come back to clean (again,¬†*my fianc√© did the cleaning*, per our agreement, since he worked 20 hours a week five minutes away from their home and I worked up to 50 45 minutes away).

Now I feel like I‚Äôm at a crossroads. I don‚Äôt think my fianc√© sees how toxic and emotionally manipulative this dynamic has become. He says he supports me, but I don‚Äôt see enough¬†*anger*¬†from him. I feel like I‚Äôm the only one drawing boundaries and getting punished for it.

His parents also regularly complain about the oldest brother and his wife ‚Äúkeeping‚Äù their grandchild from them. They mock the ""rules"" they have regarding their children (for example, they asked them not to kiss them when they were infants). They act entitled to time and access with no regard for others‚Äô space or capacity. And now that same controlling behavior is being turned on me.

We come from very different families. I have a small family‚Äîjust my mom and brother. My dad disappeared overseas when I was 17, and we‚Äôve never been close with extended family. My fianc√©‚Äôs family, on the other hand, is large, tight-knit, and full of¬†*expectations*. Holidays, reunions, family dinners, extended-family trips‚Äîyou name it, we‚Äôre expected to be there. And we are. More than any of his three brothers, honestly.

The expectations don‚Äôt stop with blood relatives. His mom‚Äôs best friend has three sons around the same age as my fianc√© and his brothers, and they‚Äôre basically treated like family. His mom has even said to my fianc√© that her and this family is ""a package deal"" for me. We‚Äôre expected to attend their events, vacations, even made-up holidays with this family. I don‚Äôt really connect with them‚Äîthey‚Äôre very wealthy and, in my opinion, out of touch‚Äîbut I‚Äôve still shown up often. 

I‚Äôm very introverted but I showed love in the ways I know how. I gave thoughtful gifts for every birthday, Mother‚Äôs Day, Christmas. Many times I was the¬†*only*¬†one who got them gifts, and they even recognized this by mentioning it to their sons. There have been times when my birthday has fallen on Fathers Day, and I would spent it celebrating his father, even getting him a gift-- despite how hard that day is for me. I always tried to show up and be thoughtful, even when it was hard.

A digital third place for the in-between hours: after work, before bed, during existential limbo.

1kiko7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1kiko7s/my_wife_never_wanted_kids/,My Wife Never Wanted Kids,"When I met Lacey, it was love at first sight. I saw her across from me in my college history class, and I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes away. Eventually, after three classes, I managed to go up and introduce myself. I probably looked like an idiot, but she saw my Lord of the Rings t-shirt and said it was her favorite series - she loved the Shelob scene. In the midst of talking about Frodo and Middle Earth, I managed to ask her for coffee and she said yes. To this day, it‚Äôs still my favorite t-shirt. 

The more we talked, the more we realized how in sync we were about so many things - music, movies, books, travel. With one exception - she didn‚Äôt want kids. Ever. I thought that was a bit much, but she said she‚Äôd had a painful history so I didn‚Äôt question it. Why would I? She was perfect - that was all years away.  

Shortly after college, I got a good job and decided it was time, so I took her to a romantic dinner and proposed. We got married and it‚Äôs been wonderful since, the best eight years of my life. But I always felt something was missing. 

I wanted to be a father. No, I *needed* to be a father. And I knew she‚Äôd be an amazing mother. So why let the opportunity pass us by? Once we were pregnant, I knew she‚Äôd come around. 

So I tampered with her birth control pills. It‚Äôs amazing how many pills look the same. And how easy it is to manipulate a condom so that it‚Äôs ineffective - turns out all of those evil mother-in-law stories had it right. Who knew?

When we found out she was pregnant, I was overjoyed. We‚Äôd have the family I always wanted. But she didn‚Äôt share my joy. Instead, she kept talking about how she‚Äôd never wanted children and this was a disaster. She even brought up the idea of terminating our pregnancy - I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I told her under no circumstances would I allow that - I‚Äôd lock her in her room if I had to. I thought that would settle it. 

The next week I came home and she was gone. Her door had been forced open, her things were missing, and her phone was left sitting on the bed. 

How *dare* she?

I spent the next seven months trying to find her - eventually my efforts led me to a small house on the edge of a town three states over. I let myself in and crept to the lone bedroom. 

What I saw horrified me. 

Lacey lay on the bed, her body split open. She was surrounded by white sacs in every direction, some cracked open, some eaten. And above her perched a large, black spider, chewing her insides. 

I heard the door close behind me, and looked back to see two more creatures like the first hanging over me. 

They looked‚Ä¶ *hungry.*

The red bits do seem dry and my face flushes when it's hot now (it didn't do previously).

I have tried: Hydrocortisone - no affect.

Daktacort - no affect other than making my face slightly more red.

Duac - made my face significantly more inflamed and gave a burning sensation. I stopped using it after a few applications. My face has never recovered from this and is a lot worse than before I took it.

Im currently using Dermal 500 face wash from my doctor along with cetaphil moisturizer. The wash doesn't seem to help much and the moisturizer makes my face more red I think. I think it blocks my pours aswell unless it's a coincidence that I get a couple of white heads after using it. Cerave moisturizer seemed to give me whiteheads as well.

I cut down diary about 80% for weeks and that hasn't helped.

Those three are: John‚Äôs niece, Kayley, Jen McCabe and Kerry Roberts: (testimony statements from first trial):

**Karen Read's call with Jen McCabe:¬† Kayley is awoken by Karen at approximately¬†4:30 am screaming¬†and acting frantic.¬† Karen then ran into John's bedroom to retrieve Kayley's cell phone and she began texting and calling John with no response.**

Kayley phones Jen McCabe¬†at 4:53 am.¬† She tells Jen that John didn't come home.(Karen is screaming extremely loud in background, repeating:¬† ""JEN!!... JEN!!""). 

Karen then gets on the phone and says **John didn't come home, they got into a fight and she left him at the Waterfall.**

Jen says she had just woken up, she was confused, didn't know what Karen was talking about.¬†¬†(Jen's husband, Matt had also woken up when the phone call came because Karen was screaming so loud).  Jen thought that maybe John had gone home with Chris Albert because he lived close to the Waterfall so she hung up the phone with Karen and called Julie Albert but there was no answer.  

Matt asked Jen:¬† ""What's going on?"".¬† ¬†When Jen explained the phone calls, Matt said, ""what are you talking about?¬† We saw them outside your sister's house.""

Jen then gets in touch with Karen and says, ""Karen, we saw you outside of my sister's""  Karen told Jen that she didn't remember going there and then she started yelling, ""Jen!!..Jen!!...Did I hit him?...Could I have hit him?""¬† and then Karen said that she  had a cracked taillight.Jen testified that at this point she just thought ""Karen was talking crazy""

**Karen then said, ""Oh my God, I left him there!!""**    
  
Jen testified that Karen was extremely irrational.¬† Karen reiterated that they had gotten into a fight so Karen was now all over the place screaming and very hard to understand.

Jen's next thought process is:¬† ""Okay, if she left him there, where could he be?¬† Who could he be with?"" Jen thinks about another male friend (Tom Beatty) who was supposed to meet up that night with the group so Jen calls Tom but he doesn't pick up the phone.

**Karen Read calls Kerry Roberts¬†at 5 am**:

Karen first tells Kerry that ""John is dead"" and hangs up.¬† In the next call, she states, ""I'm afraid John might be dead.¬† He might have gotten hit by a plow.¬† He did not come home last night.¬† I was not supposed to stay in Canton last night and he would never leave his niece alone.¬† I think something happened.""

Kerry tells Karen, ""okay, where are you now?""¬† ¬†Karen tells Kerry that she's driving.¬†

Karen asks, ""can I come to your house...will you drive my car?...**I don't remember anything from last we drank so much I don't remember anything.""**

Kerry says, ""if you were drinking all night and you don't remember anything you shouldn't be driving...you will get a DUI.""

While waiting for Karen to show up, Kerry phones Canton PD 911 and local hospitals by¬†5:10 am.

**Karen drives approx 25 minutes ‚Äúsearching for John‚Äù**  

  
**5:07 am:**¬† Karen leaves¬†1 Meadows Ave¬†and¬†retraces the route she had taken with John.¬† She had stated in a TV interview that she drove the 2 square miles in her search.  

At 5:23 am¬†Karen leaves a voicemail on John's phone which sounds anguished.¬† She cries out what sounds like, ""John was that you?""¬† ¬†Instead of going to Kerry Roberts place, she drives immediately to Jen's home.

**5:11 am:¬† Black SUV seen on Canton Library Camera heading towards the Waterfall**

**5:18 am:¬† Black SUV seen at Washington and Chapman on Temple Beth Abraham video**

**5:23 AM:¬† Karen leaves voicemail: crying out: ""John was that you??""**¬†¬†(at this point, is she at 34 Fairview?)

**5:35 am:¬† Karen arrives at Jen McCabe's house.**¬†¬†

Jen testifies that she tries to contact John again but there's no answer so she decides she should go out and search for him possibly at Tom's place. She goes downstairs to make a coffee.¬† Next thing, she hears screaming out front.Jen runs to her front door and sees Karen come running up the walkway.¬†¬†

**Karen is hysterically screaming, ""Jen, Jen...did I hit him?...could I have hit him?""**

**Karen then says, ""We have to go to Fairview!!!""**¬†¬†

Soon after, Kerry Roberts arrives to begin the search for John¬†starting at 1¬†Meadows¬†at around 5:46 am.¬† Jen and Karen wanted to go to 34 Fairview but Kerry thought they should double-check John's house.

(**interesting to note:**¬† while in the car, Kerry testifies that Karen is still stating that she left him at Waterfall but Jen argues, ""no, we saw you at my sister's"")¬†¬†

(*Vanity Fair interview with Karen:¬†¬†O‚ÄôKeefe said he‚Äôd check out the scene and report back. But minutes passed without word. ‚ÄúI got pissed,‚Äù Read tells me now.

Kayley said she heard Read on the phone saying, ""Maybe I did something, maybe a snow plow hit him."" Read's story later changed as she called more people. First she mentioned that there was a fight and she wondered if she had hit O'Keefe, then in another phone call no fight was mentioned but she said maybe a plow had hit him.

""I had never seen her like that. Frantic. Pacing around,""  Kayley said.

**Karen:**¬†""So, I pull at the foot of the driveway, it's snowing, John has no coat on, it's windy...so I drop him off, he goes up the driveway **and approaches the side door**, and as I see him approach the door I look down at my phone...""

**Narrator:**¬†¬†*Read says after about 10 minutes of waiting in her car, she became irritated that O'Keefe still hadn't gotten in touch with her...and she drove back to his home where she continued calling him before she says she fell asleep around 1:30 in the morning.¬† She then says she woke up before 5 am, he still wasn't home.¬† She then started canvassing the neighborhood.*¬†

1kikk0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYTools/comments/1kikk0q/does_necamocu_4_pack_razor_blade_scraper_deliver/,Does NECAMOCU 4 Pack Razor Blade Scraper Deliver on Performance Review?,"**A Handy Tool for the Job: My Take on the NECAMOCU 4 Pack Razor Blade Scraper**

Every once in a while, a handy tool comes along that feels indispensable, making life a tad easier, messes less daunting, and projects more enjoyable. The NECAMOCU 4 Pack Razor Blade Scraper is one of those tools. Equipped with four scrapers and enough replacement blades to keep you going for a good while, it confidently tackles everything from stubborn bakes onto your glass cooktop to adhesive remnants on a windshield. My experience testing it on various surfaces has been mostly positive, though not without some notes for improvement.

**Design and Ergonomics at a Glance**

The bright orange color really caught my eye. Not just because it's cheerful, but it‚Äôs also practical‚ÄîI can always spot it among my busy toolbox. Each scraper feels sturdy yet lightweight, thanks to the ABS material used in the build. I found the ergonomic curved shape and anti-slip rubber handles a blessing, especially during extended use. Gripping it felt natural, and I didn‚Äôt have to deal with any awkward pressure points, even after working on a particularly sticky decal for nearly half an hour.

If you're tackling quick, small tasks around the house like scraping stickers off jars or labels from appliances, this scraper fits the bill perfectly. For larger cleaning jobs, the long-handled scraper in the set gives you better reach and leverage. I also appreciate the safety design‚Äîprotective blade covers for peace of mind when it‚Äôs stored away. No more accidentally nicking myself when reaching into drawers!  

[Check NECAMOCU 4 Pack Razor Blade Scraper price on Amazon.](https://toolhandle.com/p/b0cm8yb7xq/)

**Performance and Versatility**

Having tested this scraper on multiple surfaces, I gotta admit, the combination of metal and plastic blades is a game changer. One of my biggest gripes with other scrapers in the past was scratches. That‚Äôs where the plastic blades shine‚Äîthey‚Äôre gentle on delicate surfaces. I nervously ran the plastic blade across the glass on my coffee table to remove leftover tape residue, and sure enough, no scratches! While the job took a bit of elbow grease, the peace of mind was worth it.

On tougher surfaces, like a grease-caked oven door or even a dried paint splatter on my garage floor, the metal blade works wonders. The sharp edge cut through stubborn dirt effortlessly, leaving surfaces almost good as new. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the blades are rust-proof‚Äîgreat news if you‚Äôre prone to leaving tools in less-than-ideal conditions (guilty).

**Perks**

- **Protective Design**: Safety covers ensure you won‚Äôt accidentally hurt yourself or your kids.  
- **Comfort Grip**: Ergonomic handle makes scraping jobs much less tiring.  
- **Durable Blades**: Rust-proof metal provides longevity and reliability.  
- **Versatility**: Multiple blade types for a variety of surfaces.  

**Areas for Improvement**

It‚Äôs not all roses, though. There are some areas where improvements could elevate the NECAMOCU scraper from great to outstanding.

- **Blade Tightening**: While it‚Äôs great that large knobs make replacing the blades tool-free, they sometimes feel a little too large. A bit of finesse in the design would make the overall setup feel sleeker.  
- **Storage for Extra Blades**: The set doesn‚Äôt come with a dedicated blade organizer, and storing loose metal blades worries me. There‚Äôs always the potential for injuries without a proper case.  
- **Plastic Blade Durability**: Plastic blades are fantastic for delicate surfaces, but they wear out faster than expected during heavy-duty use.  

**Competing Brands: How Does It Rank?**

Compared to similar products I‚Äôve tried, like the Goo Gone razor scraper, the NECAMOCU set stands out for sheer versatility. While Goo Gone offers a great metal scraper with a narrow edge, it doesn‚Äôt include a plastic blade option for delicate surfaces. On the other hand, options like the Stanley window scraper feel less ergonomic over time. NECAMOCU manages to set itself apart by offering all-in-one functionality with a comfort-first design.

However, there are products on the market‚Äîsay, the Titan multi-purpose scraper‚Äîthat come with smart storage solutions for the extra blades. If NECAMOCU found a way to incorporate a built-in storage system, they‚Äôd set the bar even higher in the space.

**Quality for Price Assessment**

Let‚Äôs talk money without mentioning exact numbers. The obvious value comes from what you‚Äôre getting‚Äîa total of 50 blades with varying purposes, four scrapers, and safety features that feel well-thought-out. Balancing these features with the price point, I‚Äôd say the NECAMOCU scraper set delivers commendable quality for the price.

While you could find cheaper scrapers, you‚Äôll likely sacrifice key components like safety or durability. The long-term value here lies in its versatility, durability, and the amount of extras included. It‚Äôs not just a scraper but a kit that ensures you‚Äôre covered for multiple needs.

I arrived early, expecting the usual buzz, students grabbing coffee, IT teams prepping lecture halls. But that morning, it was eerily quiet.

No Wi-Fi.  
No access to the learning portal.  
Even email servers were down.

A ransomware attack had taken down the entire system overnight. Lectures were cancelled. Admins couldn't access student records. Panic spread not just among students and staff but among the IT team who were scrambling to contain the breach. And here's the kicker: the attackers got in through a stolen faculty login that hadn‚Äôt been updated in over two years.

In my opinion, cybersecurity in the education sector isn‚Äôt just an IT issue, it‚Äôs a policy, awareness, and culture issue. Students log in from coffee shops, professors reuse passwords, and security training is often optional, if offered at all.

But here‚Äôs the part that sticks with me: education is supposed to empower. Yet without proper cybersecurity, it becomes a vulnerability for everyone involved.

We need a shift: from reactive responses to proactive protection. From passwords to identity-first security. Because when a university goes dark, it's not just about losing a day of classes, it's about trust, continuity, and the safety of the next generation.",1,1746802468.0,u_Special_Hornet_4562,0,1.0,False

I still have no idea where my journey is leading me, but from what I‚Äôve experienced so far, I‚Äôve had fun. In fact, my most recent date has me hoping again ‚Äî maybe even believing a little more.

I'd love to get your honest opinions ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs a blessing, constructive criticism, or a straight-up roast. I am not discounting the possibility that maybe I‚Äôm just setting the bar too low, or delusional, or something else. I had asked my friends about it, but they may be a bit too unhinged or delusional too, so would love to get some second opinion. I‚Äôm here trying to figure it out and see how my journey goes, but hey if you are feeling a bit better reading this that would be cool too (and of course I want to take credit for it.)

This is going to be a long read FYI, but if you love to overanalyze I could share even more details or further clarifications. No need to DM, let's just put it all on the table in hope all of us could review and learn (again, I will take the credit for it.)

About Me:

Age & Appearance: 31(M), Southeast Asian‚ÄìEast Asian mix, 5'10"", 182 lbs (currently bulking). I have enough self-awareness to categorize myself as 'definitely not that handsome'. Depending on  your taste, I will fall somewhere between 3.5 - 6 on physical appearance (or just Google 'early 30 chinese-southeast asian'', then you may have better idea how I look like. If there is enough interest I may try to put my pic here.) I‚Äôve got salt & pepper hair, which often gets mistaken for highlights (it‚Äôs stress and mid-life crisis).

Personality: INFP-ish. Timid in groups, loud one-on-one. If I‚Äôm being generous, I‚Äôd call myself a hopeless romantic. If you asked my friends, they would say naive. If you asked the most unhinged on the circle, I would love if they could frame it as 'adorable idiot', but they only agree on the latter part. On dates, I tend to be mischievous (I like to tease), honest (l vow to stop lying after my first date), and sluggish (sleep-deprived early bird ‚Äî thank you very much for putting up with me past 9 PM).

What I Find Attractive (and What‚Äôs Negotiable):

1. 

Beautiful ‚Äî yes, that‚Äôs mandatory.

2. 

Tall ‚Äî I tend to notice height first, but this one is negotiable. I am trying to change my mindset from 'God is showing sense of humor by creating short people' to 'every creation may or may not be beautiful in their own way'.

3. 

East Asian descent ‚Äî hardwired preference, especially for the kind of laugh that makes eyes disappear. Mandatory.

4. 

Same language ‚Äî not a requirement. I once dated someone with limited English, and we made it work through curiosity and patience. Apparently I am pretty good on learning new language too -- or at the very least it's a variable that I could control on my end with enough effort.

Dating Style: I usually go for lunch or dinner dates ‚Äî I find coffee/ice cream dates a bit too brief to know more about others. I'm a pseudo-psychologist and enjoy picking up on subtle details (like how someone holds their chopsticks). Culturally, I‚Äôm used to paying ‚Äî though I find it adorable when my date insists on grabbing the bill. It's quite a green flag on my book.

I work 50‚Äì65 hours a week, and it is lonely (in a poetic way, I am in a loud room yet to be understood by anyone. In a more realistic way, it is 'Oh God what the f***'). So having someone to share a meal who may be on the same situation and even actively putting an effort to understand me is appreciated, even if I have to foot the bill. My mom always said to treat women like how  I want my future daughter or sister to be treated ‚Äî so opening doors, helping with jackets, and checking if she‚Äôs comfortable being picked up or driven home is almost ritual to me.

Red Flags (just a confirmation I am not Mr. Perfect, and you may not want to defend me on the court.):

1. 

Verbal communication issue: Thick accent, tendency to speak fast, and eloquency. Few clarifications on this:
a.) I‚Äôve read articles ranking accents by sexiness -- mine is around the annoying end.
b.) Kinda job related and how enfatuated I am on reading, but I like to throw fancy words here and there in my writing. Doesn't exactly translate well when I try to use the words in verbal, as to begin with I don't even have any idea how the words (or even some general word) ought to be pronounced.
c.) Some recommended to take vocal course if I have concern of my pronunciation and singing voice. The first lesson is to listen to my own voice, I threw up and called it a no-no.

2. 

Simple life. My world revolves around work, family, music, and a few hobbies. Trying to talk to me about most recent trend or movies is appreciated, but at that point you might as well try to teach me how to build Ikea furniture (I am pretty useless on that department too.)

3. 

Goldfish memory. I forget where I parked and even if I paid for it. Like, often. Sounds cute until you‚Äôre wandering around a dark park for 30 minutes wondering if this guy is honestly clueless or trying to lure you into a true crime podcast.

4. 

Avoids physical contact (at first). Not because I‚Äôm a gentleman ‚Äî I‚Äôm just a nervous wreck who‚Äôs read too many articles about boundaries and legal implications. Unless she makes the first move, or I short-circuit from emotional overload, I keep things cautious. On an analogy, I prefer to take it as slow as a snail. That is resting on top of the turtle. And the turtle is dead.

About My Dates So Far:

I‚Äôve met five people through the apps. The number of dates with each varies ‚Äî max so far is three. Some conversations faded, some drifted, one I told wasn't the right fit -- she definitely deserve a better persin. Despite all, I can honestly say everyone is outstanding people whose happiness I pray for (coming from an atheist, I don't know how to top it). I‚Äôd rate them 10/10, and a few even 11/10 -- including the current one.

If there‚Äôs interest, I‚Äôd be happy to write about each one individually (with aliases), what I learned from them, and what made each interaction meaningful even if it did not last.

Thanks for reading this far. If you have any thoughts, critiques, or questions ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs just to tell me I‚Äôm delusional ‚Äî I genuinely appreciate the perspective.

Notes: I may edit this entry to provide more details, grammar check, etc.- Again the purpose is pretty much for my learning, so if you feel the need to humble me down just do it. I am raised by a Dutch grandma, I could take a beating.

Additional Extra Note: No, I don't want to use this to advertise myself to meet someone. As I have briefly mentioned, I wanted to focus on my current date -- she deserves it.

## What is Sofort Avonex?

Sofort Avonex is an **automated trading platform** that uses algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades on behalf of users. Think of it like having a robot assistant that never sleeps, constantly scanning markets for profitable opportunities.

It‚Äôs designed for both newbies and experienced traders, with tools that simplify complex trading strategies.

It supports a wide range of assets including **cryptocurrencies**, **forex**, **stocks**, and **commodities**, giving users plenty of options to diversify.

## Who Created Sofort Avonex?

This is where things get a little vague. Like many other platforms in this space (think: Bitcoin Era, Immediate Edge), the **creators of Sofort Avonex remain anonymous**. There‚Äôs no flashy founder story or team bios on the website. This doesn‚Äôt automatically mean it‚Äôs shady‚Äîmany legit platforms start anonymously to avoid regulatory messes‚Äîbut it‚Äôs something to keep in mind.

That said, the software architecture and user experience suggest it was built by people who actually understand trading and user needs. The interface is clean, responsive, and the algorithm seems plugged into real-time data effectively.

- You create an account and **deposit money**.
- The system connects you to a **partner broker**.
- You choose between **auto or manual trading**.
- The algorithm starts making trades based on your preferences.
- You can monitor your portfolio in real-time and make tweaks as needed.

It also includes a **demo mode**, which is super helpful for testing the waters without risking real cash.

## Sofort Avonex Pros and Cons

## Sofort Avonex ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where Sofort Avonex really shines. The platform pulls in **live market data**, analyzes it with AI-based algorithms, and makes fast decisions. It‚Äôs like having a Wall Street analyst in your pocket‚Äîexcept they don‚Äôt take coffee breaks.

### User-Friendly Interface

Seriously, it‚Äôs probably one of the most intuitive trading dashboards I‚Äôve used. You get clear charts, toggles for settings, and a dashboard that doesn‚Äôt overwhelm you with jargon.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **price alerts, trade triggers**, and even get email/SMS notifications. Handy if you‚Äôre not glued to your screen but still want to stay updated.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Other platforms only let you trade crypto. Sofort Avonex gives you access to **crypto, forex, stocks, and even commodities** like gold and oil. More options = more opportunities.

## Is Sofort Avonex a Scam?

Short answer: **No**, it doesn‚Äôt appear to be a scam.

I ran multiple tests, looked for red flags, and even checked out some user reviews on Reddit and Trustpilot. The results were mostly positive. The platform is transparent about trading risks and doesn‚Äôt overpromise.

But remember, **trading is risky**‚Äîeven with automation. Don‚Äôt dump your life savings into it expecting overnight riches.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Sofort Avonex?

The platform requires a **minimum deposit of $250** to get started. This is actually pretty standard for automated trading platforms. Think of it as your starting capital‚Äînot a fee. You can trade with this money or withdraw it if you change your mind (though check your broker‚Äôs withdrawal policy).

### Sofort Avonex Customer Support

Customer support here is surprisingly solid. You can reach them via:
- **Live Chat**: Available 24/7. I got a response in under 3 minutes.

1kik9p9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1kik9p9/dont_do_this_168/,DON`T DO THIS - #16/8,"So basically, I started this 16/8 fasting and I've been pushing it even further. I don't really look at the time‚ÄîI just eat once a day (a normal meal). I only drink water, tea, and black coffee while fasting. It's incredible how fast you see the first results.

I've been trying different diets and watching what I eat, but my busy life doesn‚Äôt allow me to watch *when* I eat, so I've mostly been eating late at night (before fasting). I'm tired of eating healthy and low-calorie food. I like to cook and I like to eat good food *and* I'm addicted to sugar. So when I eat these healthy low-calorie meals, I just don‚Äôt feel satisfied, and after a few days or weeks, I break the diet and start eating crap again‚Äîpasta every day, high-fat meals, and late-night McDonald's‚Äîbecause during the day I just don‚Äôt have the time or motivation to make those nice meals.

So I saw this 16/8 diet on TikTok, and it‚Äôs mostly for detox, but no one talks about how fast you can lose weight.

It‚Äôs pretty hard sometimes, especially at night. I mostly eat around 18:00 or at 12:00.

 when I eat, I try to eat as much protein as I could, but sometimes I just have a pizza or whatever (I try to get as much protein as possible in this one meal to avoid losing muscle mass). After this one meal, later in the day‚Äîbefore 18:00‚ÄîI eat a whole bowl of fruit (or you can eat salad, but I just hate it).

**HOW HARD IS IT?** Sometimes I almost cried studying until late at night without having anything to eat. Then in the morning, I wake up, look at the food I saved to eat after I come back from UNI, and almost cry again.  
The whole point is *not* to interrupt the hunger you feel. If you interrupt it, you've fasted the whole day for nothing. That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I feel hungry, and it works for me because I hate wasting time doing something for no reason.

Already after one week, I got used to it, and it feels pretty normal to me now.

* Protein slows down muscle degradation.
* The fruit bowl helps me feel full again, and the sugar gives me energy for the rest of the day.
* I allow myself one small treat after lunch (sometimes).
* At night, I drink tea and water (sometimes coffee because I have to study).
* Drinking lots of water helps me feel less hungry.
* Coffee helps a lot!

If you want, you can add supplements like protein shakes, vitamins, and minerals to keep yourself healthy.

And I even started to like it‚Äîbecause of this one meal a day, I just enjoy it so f#king much.",0,1746801951.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.33,False

I don‚Äôt like it when they bunch themselves up so their legs look like tangled wires, and I don‚Äôt like it when they spread themselves out like the radial spokes on a wheel. It was bad luck that when I met my wife we discovered we were both scared of them. As the man I kinda just wound up taking over spider killing duty. At first this meant squealing while trying to lob a shoe at one of them from a distance, but as the years went on I kinda just got tired of the stress and anxiety. Fear is exhausting. So is the pageantry of it. Jumping up and shouting and lots of running around. Over time I found myself having less and less of a fear reaction to them. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I didn‚Äôt want one crawling on my face, but it wasn‚Äôt like they had me running away in fear every time.

Lily was never great with them either, but it wasn‚Äôt what I‚Äôd call worthy of therapy. For the first ten years I knew her, she was a fairly run-of-the-mill arachnophobe. Things only got bad after this one night when we‚Äôd just come back in from an evening with friends. There‚Äôd been a storm outside. Windy as hell. I remember putting the keys down on the table by the door and when I looked back she was pulling down the hood of her coat. She let out a sigh, ran her hands through her hair, and she looked a little puzzled by what she‚Äôd felt. When she lifted her hand away there were thin black legs poking out from between her fingers. It took a second for her to react to what was all bunched up inside her cupped hand, then she screamed and threw it onto the ground. I saw it for only a second. It was so fast. Then it was off and under the nearest door and my number one concern became comforting my wife who was having a full blown panic attack.¬†

‚ÄúGet it off get it off *get it off!*‚Äù She screamed while slapping at her neck and hair. I hugged her tight, checked her hair and then checked it again when she asked me to. Then she stripped her top off to make sure nothing else was clinging to her clothes, before I took her into the kitchen and we had a cup of tea while she kept scratching at the back of her head.¬†

‚ÄúLittle fucker,‚Äù she half-cried, half-laughed. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it. Did you see it? It was huge!‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of the biggest yet,‚Äù I said. Truthfully, I only had half-glimpsed memories of it scuttling away but it *had* been big. Large enough that a pint glass wouldn‚Äôt have fit over its darting legs. Just seeing it had left me feeling anxious, but at the time I ignored my own discomfort. After all, I‚Äôd hardly been the real victim.¬†

‚ÄúAnd it got away!‚Äù She cringed. ‚ÄúOh God. It‚Äôs still in this house somewhere, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

I wanted to lie but thought better of it.¬†

‚ÄúSomewhere, yeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôll spider proof the bedroom tonight and I‚Äôll go looking in the morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù She smiled mournfully. ‚ÄúJesus. I just know I‚Äôm going to have a hard time sleeping tonight.‚Äù

She made me strip the bed before she got in it. And all night she kept flicking at her fringe and the hair on the back of her neck. I felt so bad for her. If that had been me I can‚Äôt say I would have reacted much better. Neither of us slept that well, but I was mostly just worried about her. When you love someone, it‚Äôs tough to see them suffer.¬†

But it wasn‚Äôt just that one night. The second one was much the same. The third, fourth, and so on. It petered out a little in the second week but then she saw a spider on some tv show and the anxiety came back full force. Every night was the same. I had to strip the bed of everything, lift the mattress, and check for spiders. She even got rid of her bedside table so there‚Äôd be less hiding places for one.¬†

In the meantime I was on hunting duty. In her own words, I had to find the bastard or she‚Äôd never feel safe in that house again. It‚Äôs funny but in hindsight I can‚Äôt really say *what* I saw go scuttling under the doorway that first night, but I do know I didn‚Äôt try all that hard to find it. I remember finding some webs under the living room sofa that were real odd. The fibres were thick like the fake stuff they bring out on halloween, and I had to peel them off the carpet like velcro. I found a couple of these nests throughout the house, but I never mentioned them. One of them hid a hole in the floor that really should have alarmed me, but I just ignored it.

I ignored a lot, actually. I found dead mice spun up in cocoons and something bore a hole through one of the kitchen cupboards and filled it with silk. Nothing normal about that, but I just covered it up with some cans and moved on. A behaviour I find hard to explain in hindsight.

Maybe my attention was elsewhere. Lily wasn‚Äôt in a great place, and she was slowly getting worse. She cried a lot, and any little thing that touched her skin would result in lots of panicked yelling. She couldn‚Äôt eat a meal without slapping at her arms and neck every few seconds. Things got real bad when I came back one night to find her shaving her head. She told me she got tired of mistaking the feeling of her own hair for a spider, so this was the simplest way to feel clean and safe. If you‚Äôve ever lived with anyone who‚Äôs had a breakdown, there‚Äôs usually this moment where your heart sinks as you realise that what you‚Äôre dealing with has transcended the norm. It‚Äôs quite frightening actually. Reminded me of when my mum found a lump. It‚Äôs a very isolating sort of fear. I remember lying awake in bed that night and just thinking about how I‚Äôd found Lily bent over the bath, shaver in hand, with a patchy head like that doll from Toy Story. When she looked over her shoulder at me she smiled and her eyes were so wide, I felt like I wasn‚Äôt looking at my wife anymore.¬†

Have you ever missed someone while you still live with them? Made them coffee and breakfast and chatted about your day, but it‚Äôs like nobody‚Äôs there? Everyday was the same. I‚Äôd tell her about work, and she‚Äôd tell me about how she‚Äôd scrubbed the bedroom top to bottom looking for spiders, or started pulling up the bathroom tiles to check for nests. At one point I realised she‚Äôd taken a lot of time off work but she wouldn't give me a straight answer so I had to call her office. They wouldn‚Äôt even answer my calls, which I had to take as a pretty bad sign.

It came as a relief when she got sectioned. Everything came out all at once. She‚Äôd tried putting a hammer to one of the walls to find what was behind it, not realising that it was just the neighbour‚Äôs living room on the other side. I was at work during all this, but things clearly escalated pretty quickly and the police arrived to find a partially bald woman screaming about spiders in the walls. By the time I got home they‚Äôd already taken her to be assessed at the local hospital. I rushed to visit her but in the meantime I had to call her parents and it was‚Ä¶ well it was a relief because I wasn‚Äôt alone anymore. Other people knew what was going on and that made it a little easier for me to navigate. Until then I‚Äôd been afraid to mention it to anyone. I guess I was a little embarrassed, or maybe just not sure what the etiquette was for discussing someone else‚Äôs mental health.

She was only gone about a night. Not even twelve hours really. The neighbours agreed not to press charges if I paid for all the repairs and Lily got therapy. Lily‚Äôs parents are quite well off, so they helped us out with that. They found this clinic that she stayed at for a couple of weeks. It specialised in exposure therapy which really just means getting a person used to their phobia. Don‚Äôt like water? Spend hours every day in a pool. Don‚Äôt like moths? Step into a room with thousands of them. This is oversimplification, of course. It‚Äôs a special program that involves gradual increases in the nature of the exposure. The first night she called me and told me they‚Äôd had her looking at pictures of a spider and talking about her experience. They were literally just cartoony drawings, but she told me she found it hard anyway. She cried and I cried too. She was only a few hours drive away but I didn‚Äôt want to be away from her and everything had happened so suddenly. It was only six weeks between that night with the storm and her ending up in that clinic, but in that short period of time I felt like the ground had fallen from beneath my feet.

Two weeks she was in there. I don‚Äôt remember them well. There were phone calls every night. She was getting better, she told me. And the doctor confirmed as much. Hard going, for sure. They had to sedate her the day she graduated from cartoons to actual photos of spiders. Apparently she scratched an orderly up real bad.¬†

My time in the house was lonely. Little weird too, if I‚Äôm honest. I woke up at one point with cobwebs in my hair, and at some point I realised that I hadn‚Äôt seen a spider in my home for a long time. Not even a little money spider. I briefly wondered about what the hell had been leaving cobwebs around the place, but never followed up on it. It‚Äôs hard to get my thoughts straight. I do remember finding more dead mice all webbed up in the back of that kitchen cupboard. One morning I came down to find a starling cocooned on the outside of the kitchen window. No sign of what did it thought. I just stared at it and sipped my coffee, then I left for work and when I came back it was gone.¬†

Probably not a good time to tell you I was diagnosed with a kind of dementia some time ago. I guess that‚Äôs supposed to help make sense of things, right? I don‚Äôt know. Doesn‚Äôt feel like it makes sense to me. It‚Äôs not like Alzheimer‚Äôs runs in my family. They say the neurons of a human brain with Alzheimer‚Äôs look like a cobweb that‚Äôs had holes poked in it. That‚Äôs a good way to describe how my mind feels to live inside. Thoughts travel along a given route and then just‚Ä¶ drop off.¬†

Lily‚Äôs therapy progressed nicely though. I remember that quite clearly. The phone calls and the sound of her voice. Real vivid. Jesus I missed her so bad during this time. I hate being overly sentimental but it had been a tough and lonely six weeks, and hearing her sound increasingly happy and confident with each new phone call was like a shot of pure happiness right into my veins. I missed her, and I wanted her back. And when she told me, giggling with joy, that she‚Äôd held a little spider on day ten I burst out crying right with her. I felt pride at her accomplishment, and I felt relief that things might be getting back on track for us. Like the nightmare was finally gonna be over.

It wasn‚Äôt so simple when I saw her in person. She came back looking like the war wounded. I should say she looked beautiful, but I want to be honest. I smiled when I saw her but it didn‚Äôt reach my eyes because the woman who got into the car looked a lifetime apart from the woman who‚Äôd been living with me just a few months ago. She was thin as a rake, with ashy pallid skin and a shaved head that made her look like a matchstick. And her eyes, the look in them wasn‚Äôt right. But she was smiling, so I swallowed the funny feeling I had in my stomach and pretended everything was okay.

There was no work for her to go back to, and I managed to get some time off after speaking to my boss. It was just us and that can be a weird feeling for a couple used to working 9 to 5. I was on edge. Didn‚Äôt know what to expect. She smiled a lot. Tried her best to reassure me, and I asked a lot about what therapy was like and she told me it was fantastic. Showed me photos of her sitting next to big house spiders, some as wide as her palm. Had to fight back my own fear while looking at them. She told me that was day 13, but when I asked what happened on day 14 she said it was mostly just packing up and saying goodbye.¬†

There is a dark and uncomfortable truth to relationships, and it‚Äôs that time only flows in one direction. My wife hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong and I didn‚Äôt really feel any ill will towards her, but a distance had been placed between us. All the best will in the world couldn‚Äôt undo it. She‚Äôd changed. Been changed, I guess. At the time I didn‚Äôt know how to understand any of it, but I wasn‚Äôt sure how to treat her. When I kissed her it was on the cheek. When I held her, it was like hugging a female coworker. I didn‚Äôt know what my own feelings were, and I wouldn‚Äôt until I found her one morning in the kitchen tapping away at a pint glass and giggling like a toddler. It wasn‚Äôt the light and airy laughter of the woman I was used to. It was more like the laughter of a bunch of kids egging on a fight or cheering on a nasty bully.¬†

She didn‚Äôt speak when she looked at me. She just turned back to the glass and kept laughing, flicking it gently with her fingers. When I walked around the table I saw it under there. A *very* large house spider. I don‚Äôt know what is normal for people around the world, but a UK house spider is big if its legs are wider than the palm of your hand. This thing was even bigger with legs bundled up against the side of the glass like spools of segmented wool, and seeing it made me jump way back. I realised I hadn‚Äôt seen another spider since the night of the storm, and that thing all curled up with legs as thick as hairpins was a real shock to my system. I cried out and my wife‚Ä¶ She started *howling* with laughter. I mean, it was like a toddler discovering cartoons for the first time. Manic and weird and just so fucking happy but in a way that was a little alien because I didn‚Äôt understand the thoughts and feelings that went into that ear splitting cackle and it was all wrong coming from her.¬†

I waited for her to say something, but she didn‚Äôt. She just laughed until something in her got tired and she slowly stopped giggling but she *still* didn‚Äôt say anything even after she‚Äôd gone quiet. In the end it was me who broke the silence. I didn‚Äôt have a clue what to say. The whole time she was staring at me with her patchy hair and gleeful teary eyes and I got so desperate to break the stand off that I stammered out the words,

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a big one, ain‚Äôt he?‚Äù

Her face relaxed. Her shoulders slumped. She slipped out of the crazy like it was only ever an outfit.¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll get bigger,‚Äù she said.¬†

And then she lifted the glass, snatched the spider up, and stuffed it into her mouth. I didn‚Äôt see it. Not fully. But I stood, frozen in terror, and watched the muscles in her badly shaved head tense and relax as her jaw worked away, crunching at those hardened legs. Jesus Christ‚Ä¶ the sounds were bad enough but when she was done, she looked over her shoulder at me and smiled and her teeth were smeared green and black with littles of bits of leg and chitin still stuck between the gums.¬†

I‚Äôm not entirely sure what happened next, but now I knew why I‚Äôd felt so different around her since she‚Äôd come back. I was afraid of her, like a kid around an abusive parent. I just didn‚Äôt know what I was gonna get. There was always this energy in the room that had me on edge. I‚Äôd sit there watching tv but I wasn‚Äôt *really* watching. Couldn‚Äôt have told you what was on half-the-time. Instead every ounce of my being was focused on her. Every breath. Every motion. When she got up to use the toilet I watched her intensely to see what she was going to do. The fact that she rarely did anything except carry on as normal was all the more unsettling because I *knew* something was wrong and I couldn‚Äôt stop remembering the way she‚Äôd laughed with that thing under the glass.¬†

Nights were bad. A lot of the time I‚Äôd wake and get the feeling she‚Äôd just been watching me but she was usually fast asleep, or at least that‚Äôs how it looked. Sometimes there were furtive movements like she‚Äôd *just* rolled over. I got used to it, thought it was probably just in my head. But then one night I woke up and she was right there, face inches away from mine. I cried out. Couldn‚Äôt help it. Shuffled backwards while trying to avoid touching her and wound up falling off the bed. When I looked up from the floor she had a completely blank expression. She was just looking at me like a cat watching a fly.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I cried out, unable to stop the irritation from bleeding into my voice.¬†

She shrugged.¬†

‚ÄúJust watching.‚Äù

Then she rolled over like nothing had happened.¬†

That night I slept on the sofa. She didn‚Äôt ask why. Didn‚Äôt say a word as I grabbed my things and left the bedroom. I wasn‚Äôt sure I would manage to fall asleep after that, but I did. And when I woke up I had cobwebs in my hair.¬†

I was lucky if I slept more than a few hours a night after that. It came fitfully, if at all. I woke up too many times to the feeling of something tickling my face and chest, a sensation like someone running a feather over me. Every time I‚Äôd come to in a panic, but I never found anything except nearly-invisible silk clinging to my skin. Life without sleep was difficult, and I struggled to hide my dislike for Lily. Over time our habits and routines diverged even further apart. I stopped going upstairs almost entirely. Just didn‚Äôt need to. I had work and the sofa and the kitchen, and the days when I came back and barely saw Lily at all were fine by me. I preferred being away from her. Something that kinda broke my heart, if I‚Äôm honest. There were times I wanted to reach out, but looking at her gave me the funniest feeling in my stomach. I didn‚Äôt want to change things. Didn‚Äôt want to get closer. If anything, I wanted to run away. And I don‚Äôt mean that I wanted to flee my life and adult responsibilities in some abstract way. I mean I felt a powerful urge to quite *literally* run away from her. It was horrible feeling that way about my wife, and just trying to understand those emotions was enough to give me a headache most days.¬†

I became real forgetful during this time, and it was a long time before I realised I‚Äôd forgotten to pay for the repairs to the wall. I think it slipped my mind. Emphasis on *think* because I don‚Äôt remember what I have and haven‚Äôt forgotten. I just nailed some plywood over and left it and three months later, one day, out of the blue it occurred to me I should probably have done something more about it. I did find a toolkit in the kitchen that wasn‚Äôt mine. I might have called someone out for a quote. I don‚Äôt know. But once I remembered that I‚Äôd never actually *fixed* the hole, I was filled with this shame and embarrassment and I decided the best thing to do was to face it head on and go apologise to my neighbour.

I never knew a lot about the guy. He was an older man who liked his football, had a nose like a tomato, and spent most nights in the pub. I knew he lived alone though, and when I knocked his door and there was no answer it wasn‚Äôt too strange. At least it didn‚Äôt seem out of the ordinary until I went back inside my house and heard footsteps on the other side of the wall. So I went back and I knocked a couple more times figuring he maybe hadn‚Äôt heard me, but there was still no answer. I found this weird. He didn‚Äôt seem like the kinda guy who‚Äôd avoid a neighbour he didn‚Äôt like. He‚Äôd just open the door and tell you to fuck off.

I went back and looked but couldn‚Äôt see anything through his windows, and all I could see looking through his letterbox was a grey sheet across the opening. When my fingers came away covered in a sticky thread, I had this terrible feeling in my stomach. I couldn‚Äôt have possibly explained how, but I was convinced that Lily had done something. After all, it was him calling the police who‚Äôd gotten her into trouble. But it wasn‚Äôt like I could kick his door down to check, and I wasn‚Äôt gonna go scrambling through any half-open windows.¬†

Fortunately, we shared a fence in the back garden. It was easy enough to jump, and from there I checked the windows on that side of the house. He‚Äôd left the kitchen blinds open, and at first what I saw baffled me. For a moment I wondered if he was decorating because everything inside was covered by a thin translucent sheet. But I only had to pay close attention to realise that didn‚Äôt make sense. When painting a ceiling, you don‚Äôt throw tarps over half-drunk cups of coffee and plates of mouldy food. And the material that covered everything was cloudy and made of thread and obviously some kind of silk. It took a lot of effort to control the urge to just hop the fence back and pretend like I never saw a damn thing. But if he needed some kind of help, then I knew I had to at least try.

I looked briefly at the stoop by the backdoor. There was a lighter on the ground where someone had dropped it. It was strangely conspicuous and made me think that whoever had left it there had done so in a hurry. Didn‚Äôt make sense that someone would drop it there and not notice, not unless they‚Äôd been otherwise occupied. I picked it up and winced when it came from the floor with a sticky tearing sound.

It was covered in barely visible silk threads.

God I wanted that backdoor to be locked. Couldn‚Äôt think of anything worse than having to push ahead, but I tried the handle and it went down. The door popped open with barely any effort and I got a good look at how every last inch of that place was covered in pale cobwebs that got thicker and thicker as my eyes drifted deeper inside the house. I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if they were strong enough to trap a person. Was my neighbour in *there* somewhere? Somebody was. I knew that much from the sounds I‚Äôd heard, but I couldn‚Äôt see him in the kitchen. I wanted to cry out for him, maybe even go marching into the house and look for myself, but the hallway out of the kitchen had been turned into a web-lined tunnel. No straight lines. Just a dark silky womb whose rounded funnel walls fluttered gently in the breeze. I stared intently into that darkness, trying my best to see if there was the shape of a man‚Äôs corpse cocooned somewhere in the pale white silk.¬†

I leaned forward, my head and shoulders just moving past the door frame, when the blackness in the tunnel grew legs. Dark carapace and segmented limbs exploded towards me so fast it was almost in the kitchen before my heart had time to skip a beat. And then it stopped half-way into the room, standing perfectly still and brazen in the fading daylight. A bundle of legs the size of a horse.¬†

A real life monster.¬†

I didn‚Äôt move. Jesus Christ it took me another minute just for my brain to process what I was looking at on a conscious level. My nervous system was quicker, sure. It was like a blanket of disgust and terror was thrown over me. My stomach plunged to the floor. My skin crawled. My heart felt like it was going to explode. But my actual mind was blank. White noise and static. The creature was *huge*. So big its legs could just about fit in the hallway behind it, but in the kitchen with a little more room, those front limbs and mouthy feelers spread out like tendrils and gripped the doorway. It was ready to pounce on whatever had sent disturbances throughout its web.¬†

I‚Äôve read that spiders can be a little like venus fly traps. They won‚Äôt always pounce on a single trigger. They need multiple hits. When I looked down at my feet I saw that I‚Äôd taken just one step inside, but that was all it needed to be alerted. Now it had approached the initial alarm and, half-blind, it waited for another hint of something trapped inside its web.

I had to wonder, would lifting my shoe count?¬†

Did I have a choice?

I couldn‚Äôt stay there. Looking at the damn thing was bringing me closer and closer to full blown panic with every passing second. I had to do something and I had to do it with some semblance of control!¬†

I slid my foot backwards. The spider didn‚Äôt move. As soon as both feet were outside, I let go of the door handle and felt something sticky detach from my palm.

It feels like an exaggeration to say that lightning moves slower. I‚Äôm not sure I have the words to describe how fast it was. I‚Äôm sure most of you have seen a nature documentary with one of those fish or maybe even a trapdoor spider and you thought *oh shit that was quick* but this thing‚Ä¶ Maybe it was just because it was coming right at me. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it except for when videos get edited. All of a sudden it was just there, and before I knew it thick woolly paps were pinning me to the ground and I was looking into a pink slit of a mouth framed by fangs as long as my forearms. They moved independent of each other, and something about the sight of all those wheel-spoke legs and segmented joints clumped together in its thorax sent my mind reeling. I said at the beginning of this that a lifetime of exposure had helped curb my arachnophobia, but there are limits.¬†

I blacked out.¬†

When I woke up it was dark all around me. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but the belly of the beast was my neighbour‚Äôs former living room. It wasn‚Äôt actually pitch black, but it did take a few terrifying minutes for my eyes to adjust well enough just to be able to see my own body stuck and wriggling beneath me. I was wrapped up tight, and if you‚Äôve ever heard the refrain that spider‚Äôs silk is stronger than steel and doubted it, well trust me, it‚Äôs true. A few thin threads doesn‚Äôt give you a proper sense of it. But I was wrapped in what must have been a half-inch of the stuff and I felt like I was wearing ten layers of lycra that was too small. There was a tiny bit of give. Enough to let me move fingers or toes, or even bend a knee just a fraction, but that was it.¬†

It was horrifying. I‚Äôm not exactly claustrophobic either, for what it‚Äôs worth, but given the circumstances I found myself panicking as I tried to get some purchase. I kept thinking if I could get a finger hooked into it then maybe I could start tearing away? I was desperate but the more I fought the more I realised it was hopeless. The silk was elastic and strong and covered in a thick, stodgy glue that only further limited my movement as everything I did spread it around until it was gumming my legs and hands together.

Wasn‚Äôt until exhaustion caught up to me and I was forced to take a short break that I realised I wasn‚Äôt alone.

There was another cocoon beside me.¬†

My neighbour had been a big man in life. Podgy with a large pot belly and a head like a thumb. But in the dim light of that room he looked like a skeleton wrapped in skin that had been found half-decayed in an ancient and forgotten tomb. So thin and desiccated you could hook a finger under the tendons in his neck and jaws. I nearly cried when I realised I‚Äôd risked everything to save a dead man, but that wasn‚Äôt actually true. The error in my thinking became apparent when he opened his eyes and glared at me with pure, unbridled terror. He opened his mouth and I was convinced he was about to scream when instead he coughed and gagged and something wet and brown dribbled out of his mouth.¬†

It flopped down his chin and came to rest on the floor between us. It resembled a hair band encased in bile and vomit, and I was momentarily stumped until I saw a thin brown leg unfurl from the tangled mess.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

My neighbour‚Äôs entire body relaxed, his eyes vacant and confused, as Lily knelt down beside me and stroked my head.¬†

‚ÄúLily you‚Äôve got to get me‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShh,‚Äù she said, pressing a single finger to my lips. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs going to be okay.‚Äù

Behind her, a shadow appeared. It had legs as thick as my wrist, and they reached from the floor to the ceiling.

‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be much longer now,‚Äù she added as the darkness behind her grew. ‚ÄúProbably best to just keep you here.‚Äù

‚ÄúLily what the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you they‚Äôd get bigger,‚Äù she said, nodding towards the spider my neighbour had just spat onto the floor. ‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt be any real help.‚Äù She touched my neighbour‚Äôs head, but he barely responded. He just gazed vacantly as she rolled him over so that he was facing away from me. ‚ÄúFor such a clever animal,‚Äù she added as she parted his hair, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always curious about just how much you miss.‚Äù¬†

Something was clamped around the back of his head. A throbbing bulb of mottled brown skin and hair. It looked like a spider without legs. A tick, maybe. That‚Äôs what I thought it was until my wife ran a finger playfully along its back and my neighbour let out a gut wrenching squeal of pain. Slowly, the shape seemed to wriggle and writhe and a long thin leg emerged from beneath its body and I realised I was looking at a spider wrapped tight around his skull, its legs buried beneath the skin and muscle of his scalp.¬†

For a moment it playfully curled the leg in the air before returning it to the incision and sliding it back into place, every inch disappearing with a gruesome wet sound. It displaced muscle and hair and when it came to rest, I realised just how misshapen his skull had become from all those legs wrapped tight around his head.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù I gasped.

‚ÄúDo you ever find it weird that you can‚Äôt remember what it looked like? The thing that came running out of her hand?‚Äù she asked before reaching over to stroke my head.¬†

Her hand came away covered in cobwebs.

Something about her touch revolted me. It sent strange shivers coursing through my body. A deep primordial need to get away came over me. That strange revulsion all over again, the same one that had taunted me over and over again over the last few weeks. Without even meaning to I found myself convulsing and panicking, my body trying to thrash violently but with every limb constricted by that silk I could do nothing except writhe around on the floor. I tried with everything I had to move my hands, to get some purchase on the silk and tear away at it to free myself. But it was no use. I could do nothing except glare at my wife and the enormous shadow behind her. The one that towered above us both, its great legs clustering around the floor and ceiling.¬†

At some point I grabbed onto my trousers and clenched my fist and felt something small and hard.¬†

The lighter.¬†

I knew there was great risk in using it, but I had no choice. I managed to worm my hand into my pocket and find it with my fumbling fingers. My wife seemed oddly aware of what I was doing, and she seemed to tilt her head like a curious dog as I clenched my fist around the small object and used every ounce of willpower I had left to fight the violent seizures that racked my body and thumbed the trigger.¬†

The web went up in flames immediately. It must have been the glue, but the flames exploded across the silk like they‚Äôd been soaked in kerosene. Before I even realised that it had weakened enough for me to free one arm, the tongues of fire were already spreading across the floor where they found my poor neighbour.¬†

The burning sensation that crawled across my legs and chest hurt like nothing I could imagine, but I was finally free. I rolled over and began to push myself up, already desperately patting at my body to try and put out the flames. When I looked around me, my wife and the shape that followed her were gone. For a moment I considered helping my neighbour, but his body thrashed too violently and although his eyes were wide open, spiders were pouring from his mouth and I could not summon the courage to take another step towards him. All I could think of was escape.

The house was going up like a tinderbox. It wasn‚Äôt far to the kitchen, but the fire had already beat me there. Smoke billowed upwards and, trapped by the ceiling, started to fill the air with choking soot. The only escape was the backdoor, and I stumbled towards it but was stopped at the last moment by the sight of my wife standing there.

‚ÄúYou really are such a fascinating spec‚Äì‚Äù

I barrelled past her, but to my surprise she offered no resistance. I merely emerged into the open air, my lungs gasping desperately for clean air as I collapsed onto long unkempt grass. I looked over my shoulder and saw orange tongues of fire were already leaping out of the windows on the upper floor. Left uncontrolled, the fire would rage and consume the entire row of terrace houses. I felt a moment of remorse, but there were already sirens in the distance so I knew someone had noticed and done the right thing.¬†

But it wasn‚Äôt over.¬†

Lily was sitting on the fence. I don‚Äôt know how she got there, but she looked completely undisturbed.

‚ÄúI never once imagined that when that wind blew me into your home, I‚Äôd find such an interesting pair of people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat a fun mind to sink my legs into. I really had no idea what I was going to find.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet her go!‚Äù I gasped.

‚ÄúI have,‚Äù she said with a shrug. ‚ÄúI did, months ago as a matter of fact. There were some incompatibilities and it just made sense to move homes.‚Äù She pointed at me and smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve enjoyed living inside your head quite a bit.‚Äù

Struggling to make sense of her words, but still somehow aware of their terrifying implications, I placed one hand on the back of my head and felt it. Felt *her*. The mere touch was enough to fill my mouth with a coppery taste, while my vision blurred at the edges. Something beneath my skin shifted and I felt a terrible pressure behind my eyes. I had to get rid of her, and I only knew of one weakness.¬†

‚ÄúOh well,‚Äù she said as she watched me fumble desperately for the lighter. ‚ÄúNot every relationship has to last forever to be meaningful.‚Äù

I lit my hair on fire.¬†

My last memories were of heat and a sudden release of pressure. I couldn‚Äôt possibly describe it to you. Not really. Something slid out of my skull and Lily waved at me from the fence before she seemed to blink out of existence and then‚Ä¶ nothing. Not even darkness. Just total absence.

I wouldn‚Äôt regain a sense of self until the hospital several weeks later.¬†

There was nothing left of either house, but they did manage to control the fire before it spread to the others. I‚Äôm sure there was still some damage, and to this day I feel guilty about it. I think I was charged with arson. Maybe more. I have vague memories of being wheeled into a courtroom. The doctors have agonised over me for a long time, and one mentioned amateur trepanation. He said I must have practiced it on my wife, at least based on the body they found in my neighbour‚Äôs house. But I can‚Äôt really be sure of anything. I am forever dipping in and out of reality. Writing this down has been‚Ä¶ difficult. I‚Äôm not *entirely* aware where I am right now. One doctor told me I might make some kind of recovery, if it was just normal brain damage. But he‚Äôd never seen anything like it, so he couldn‚Äôt be sure.

Feels like it‚Äôs a different doctor every time I see them. Then again, I don‚Äôt always recognise myself when I look in the mirror. Of course that could just be the burns, but I reckon even then I still look a fair bit older than I should.¬†

There is one orderlie who‚Äôs stuck around long enough to get to know me. He knows me by name. Smiles a lot when he sees me. Talks to me about all sorts of things. He seems genuinely interested in me and what I remember. I called him in once to get rid of a spider that had spun a web on the window outside and he did so with a warm smile. I told him I was deathly afraid of them, and he said he already knew that, but I shouldn‚Äôt worry because he was going to keep an eye on me and make sure nothing bad happened. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs around. Ever since he‚Äôs started working here I haven‚Äôt seen many of the nasty little things hanging around my room.

I guess he‚Äôs not that bothered by them, at least not if the cobwebs in his hair are anything to go by.",7,1746801904.0,u_ChristianWallis,1,1.0,False

‚ÄúThat one?‚Äù

‚ÄúDirectional thrusters.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶that one?‚Äù

‚Äú...also directional thrusters.‚Äù

Katie nodded. ‚ÄúWhat about-‚Äù

‚Äú-If you want, we can get you on a pilot certification course.‚Äù Melanie turned to her, smiling.

Katie pulled her finger away from the console and clasped her hands together, thumbs fidgeting.¬†

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù She smiled awkwardly, sitting back in her seat. She continued watching Melanie work for a while longer.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting, but‚Ä¶there‚Äôs more to it than just steering. I‚Äôm not sure if I want all that responsibility.‚Äù¬†

Melanie nodded.¬†

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶I wasn‚Äôt sure either. Only took the course for the pay bump. It‚Äôs actually not that hard once you get used to it - but the shift work can be a bit of a pain.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Yeah‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know about that either.‚Äù

Katie pulled her legs up and folded them comfortably onto the chair.¬†

‚ÄúI just feel like I should be doing more. More than just helping out.‚Äù

‚ÄúDefinitely.‚Äù¬†

Katie frowned. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù

Melanie smiled. ‚ÄúNo I mean - you do help, and it‚Äôs appreciated. But I know how you feel.‚Äù¬†

She swiped through a few screens on the navigation display.

‚ÄúWhen everyone has a specialty and it feels like you‚Äôre just a spare pair of hands? Yep, I know that feeling. Especially on a small ship like this.‚Äù¬†

Katie flopped her head back, letting it rest on the back of the chair.¬†

‚ÄúYes - exactly. I feel like‚Ä¶a spare. Like I should do more to contribute.‚Äù

Melanie looked thoughtfully out of the cockpit.

‚Äú...well, there are lots of options - maintenance, engineering, piloting; then there‚Äôs all the other systems qualifications like navigation, communications, sensors‚Ä¶‚Äù

Katie blinked. ‚Äú...really? All of those? That sounds like a lot.‚Äù

Melanie chuckled. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not like you do them all at once. One at a time. Practice it, get comfortable with it, then if you want - do another.‚Äù

Katie sat comfortably in her seat next to Melanie, thinking.

‚ÄúI always just took on a sort of diplomatic, therapist kind of role? Administrative tasks, communication - never qualified though. Maybe I should try getting my hands dirty - oh! Cooking?‚Äù¬†

Melanie squinted. ‚ÄúShip‚Äôs‚Ä¶chef?‚Äù

Katie giggled. ‚ÄúOkay, maybe as a side project. For now - I‚Äôll stick with helping you out with cargo, and see if Gordon wants to teach me some maintenance. Everybody needs maintenance, right?‚Äù¬†

Melanie pursed her lips, trying not to smile. ‚ÄúHmm.‚Äù

‚Äú...no?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yes‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find maintaining ships nearly as entertaining as maintaining‚Ä¶people.‚Äù She smiled to herself.

Katie squinted at her, prodding Melanie with her toe.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll maintain you if you‚Äôre not careful.‚Äù

‚Äú...you‚Äôre getting better at the comebacks, but I think we still-‚Äù

The communications console lit up with an insistent beeping.¬†

*Priority Message.*

The smile disappeared from Melanie‚Äôs face as she looked at it for a split second, immediately turning to check the sensors, tapping her comm. Katie sat bolt upright.¬†

‚ÄúCap - priority message.‚Äù¬†

A brief burst of adrenaline sent Melanie‚Äôs heart rate spiking as she started a sensor scan. She waited nervously, breathing a small sigh of relief as the scan came up clean.¬†

There were no asteroids or debris to hide a ship behind - there was little chance they were being attacked. She kept the sensors running a close proximity scan, just in case.¬†

The friendly pirates warned you first.¬†

The unfriendly ones didn‚Äôt.¬†

Luke came jogging up the corridor, glancing around the consoles for any warning lights or signs of danger.

Melanie turned as he entered. ‚ÄúNothing. We‚Äôre all clear - right now at least. Might *actually* just be a message.‚Äù

Luke breathed a big sigh and nodded, taking a moment to gather himself.¬†

‚ÄúRight!‚Äù¬†

He rubbed his face, hand shaking slightly.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶a relief. Okay, let‚Äôs see.‚Äù¬†

Katie stood up to move out of the way as Luke stepped over to the console. He tapped his comm to confirm his ID, clenching his hand a few times to calm himself down.

>*\[BEGIN TRANSMISSION\]*

>*Attention: Civilian Vessel Eventide*

>*Acknowledge receipt and compliance immediately.*¬†

>*\[END\]*

Luke read it again before sending an acknowledgement.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù

\*\*\*

Luke shifted uncomfortably in his chair.¬†

‚ÄúJust the usual, mundane stuff...‚Äù He sighed to himself, scrolling through the logs.

Nobody from *The Eventide* had even been allowed to leave the docking bay during their brief stop. The cargo bay recordings showed it - everyone was accounted for. That at least, was working in their favour.

A simple delivery - one item on the cargo manifest. A standard part, nothing weird about it.¬†

No unusual comms traffic. No garbage disposals, airlock activations, maintenance activity - nothing. Just a completely normal run, except for one tiny, very common discrepancy.

He scrolled back to the manifest and looked at it again. Eight hundred grams.

‚ÄúWhy this time, of all times‚Ä¶‚Äù he sighed, again.

He leaned back in his chair and stretched, looking at the ceiling.¬†

Whatever happened must have been serious. Even in these new political times, local authorities didn‚Äôt threaten to arrest crews and impound ships unless there was a suspicion of criminal activity. Something valuable must have been stolen - or maybe it was drug smuggling again.

He sat up, reaching for his mug.¬†

One last job to do - the comms logs. Although he hated the idea of even suspecting someone on his crew, it was something he couldn‚Äôt avoid. The last thing he wanted was to go digging through private messages - but the station authorities would do it whether he liked it or not.¬†

He took a quick sip of the coffee and tapped in his authorization key, just as his door chimed.

‚ÄúYep?‚Äù He locked the console as Mel opened the door.

‚ÄúHey, cap. Manifests are done - anything else before I send them?‚Äù

Luke looked at her for a moment. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn‚Äôt picture Melanie doing something underhanded. If she had a problem, she‚Äôd shoot it or toss it out an airlock. He blinked - her eyebrows were raised, waiting.

‚ÄúAh - no, thanks, Mel. Appreciate it.‚Äù

She nodded, closing the door as she left.¬†

Luke turned back to the console.¬†

He scrolled through the message histories and sighed, frustrated that he‚Äôd invaded their privacy for no reason.¬†

‚ÄúNothing here, either.‚Äù

He rubbed his face. The only sticking point was that eight hundred grams. Everything else looked clean. He copied the last of the logs for the inspection and leaned back, crossing his arms, thinking.

It was weird that Gordon had so few messages, though.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Keshirr Trading station loomed larger as *The Eventide* approached. A bored-sounding Rellin voice filtered through the cockpit comms.

‚Äú*Eventide,* proceed to Docking Bay Alpha-8 and standby for inspection. Crew are to remain aboard.‚Äù

Scott followed the flight path to the letter, like he was taking his pilot‚Äôs exam all over again. He tutted in dismay as the armed guards on the dock came into view.¬†

‚ÄúReally, lads?‚Äù He muttered.

Once the docking had completed, he remained in his seat and turned to Luke expectantly.

Luke nodded, and made for the rear cargo ramp.¬†

The Rellin inspector met him at the rear ramp. She didn‚Äôt even look up from her pad before she started speaking.¬†

‚ÄúGreetings. I am Inspector Nollun. I trust you have received and understood the instructions?‚Äù

Luke was familiar with the businesslike distance of practiced bureaucrats. They weren‚Äôt intentionally offensive, it‚Äôs just how they were.¬†

‚ÄúYes. Remain on board, provide requested data.‚Äù Luke replied, scanning over the eight-man inspection team.

Inspector Nollun nodded.¬†

‚ÄúCorrect. We will now inspect your ship and its cargo.‚Äù She waved the team forward.

‚ÄúAre you carrying any animals or ‚Äòpets‚Äô that we should be aware of?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Luke answered, watching them walk past him.

She nodded.

She let the silence hang for a few moments before she finally looked up from her pad. Her eyes were watching his face with a quiet, weary expectation.

‚ÄúThe cargo you delivered was heavier than recorded by the manufacturer.‚Äù

She let the statement hang in the air.

Luke nodded. ‚ÄúIt was weighed when we picked it up and found to be heavier. Our engineer suspected extra packaging.‚Äù

Her expression didn‚Äôt change as her eyes remained on him, shaking her head. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Luke stared at her, confused. ‚Äú...no?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù¬†

Her stare was becoming uncomfortable now.

‚ÄúThe manufacturer confirmed their packaging has not changed. We checked. It may have been tampered with before you retrieved it. Or‚Ä¶‚Äù

*‚Ä¶or one of us did.*

Luke finished the comment in his head.

He sighed. ‚ÄúI see. Can you tell us what happened, at least?‚Äù

Inspector Nollun peered at him closely as she said the next words.¬†

‚ÄúA suspected mining accident. *Suspected*, for now, as investigations are ongoing. Sabotage is another possibility.‚Äù

Luke frowned, thinking. Not drug smuggling or theft.

But‚Ä¶this was a lot for a simple mining accident.¬†

‚Äú...can I ask what kind of accident? This-‚Äù

‚Äú-Twenty-three dead. Three hours after your delivery.‚Äù

Her sharp eyes examined his face as she delivered the news, but Luke barely noticed.

His mouth opened, unable to find any words. He couldn‚Äôt process how that could have happened. Bad timing? Pure coincidence? *Twenty-three?*¬†

His face paled as he wondered if any of the technicians they‚Äôd met were among them.

The inspector continued watching. She seemed to soften slightly as Luke stood there, absorbing the news. She returned to her pad, tapping gently.

‚ÄúHmm. Reactions like that are hard to fake.‚Äù¬†

Luke didn‚Äôt know where to look. ‚ÄúI had no idea. Nobody told us. We could‚Äôve turned around, offered to help‚Ä¶‚Äù

She continued tapping at her pad.

‚ÄúBetter you didn‚Äôt. That station was well armed, after all.‚Äù

He swallowed, raising his eyebrows at the idea. That was a good point.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll need your logs - when you‚Äôre able.‚Äù She added.¬†

Luke forced his mind to slow down and collected himself.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get them for you now.‚Äù

He started up the ramp, thinking about the package.

The delivery. The standoff. The technician. The weight.

Something clicked - and he stopped.

Wait.

The drive motor was heavier?

He frowned.

Or‚Ä¶was it something else?

He tried to recall the conversation with Gordon in engineering.¬†

He‚Äôd been distracted, barely paying attention.

Wasn‚Äôt it‚Ä¶something else?

He stared up the ramp as the hairs on his neck stood up.

His throat dried up.

Wasn‚Äôt it?

\*\*\*

Meanwhile, Katie prodded around inside the panel of the water recycler.

‚ÄúI have no idea how any of this works.‚Äù

Gordon smiled wearily, holding the pad up again.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to, look - we just take this filter out here, and replace it with a fresh one. That‚Äôs it. We‚Äôve unscrewed it, now we just pull it out and replace it. Just do it-‚Äù

Katie yanked the filter out, spilling foul-smelling sludge down the recycler and over the deck. She jumped back in surprise.

‚Äú-God dammit!‚Äù Gordon snapped, reaching for a rag and pulling her out of the way.

‚ÄúI was gonna say - carefully, so you don‚Äôt get crap everywhere!‚Äù

Katie winced, shoulders drooping as she watched him helplessly.

‚Äú...Sorry. Here, let me-‚Äù

‚Äú-no, it‚Äôs okay. I got it. Just‚Ä¶‚Äù He sighed, crouching down to mop up the sludge

When he finished, he tossed the rag aside without getting up. His shoulders slumped as his head hung low.

He closed his eyes and shook his head.

‚Äú...You‚Äôre doing fine. I‚Äôve done worse before.‚Äù ",15,1746801784.0,HFY,6,1.0,False

A few quick questions for you:

1. Do you close by early evening most days?
2. Have you ever considered hosting paid events, rentals, or other uses after closing? Why or why not?
3. What are your biggest concerns when it comes to letting people use your space after hours (e.g. staffing, cleanup, liability)?
4. If there were a low-effort way to earn passive revenue using your space at night‚Äîwould you be open to it?

https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/05/tariffs-trump-dolls-economy/682730/

*Interview starts with a conversation with Eleanor Mak, a doll business owner, and how the tariffs have disrupted her business. It then switches to a conversation with Martha Gimbel, director of the Economocs Lab at Yale. First segment discusses how the tariffs disrupt business owners like Mak. That's well-trod ground by now so I skipped ahead in this excerpt.*

Rosin: Yeah, so for weeks now, we‚Äôve been warned that we should expect prices of certain goods mostly made in other countries to go up, like rice, toasters, coffee, I mean, plastic goods, like you just said. Can you project overall how much a household budget of an average American family is likely to go up?

Gimbel: Yeah, so we find that we think that, you know, on average, households will pay about $5,000 more a year.

Rosin: Wait‚Äî$5,000? That‚Äôs actually a lot.

Gimbel: It‚Äôs a lot of money. You know, most people can‚Äôt easily absorb that in their household budgets, right? If you say to people, all of a sudden, To consume what you consumed last year, that‚Äôs gonna cost you $5,000 more, that makes people a little bit itchy, understandably.

One thing I should say is that as a share of income, it is a higher percent increase for households at the bottom. And that is because poor households tend to spend more of their income on goods, right? If you are a lower-income household, you are spending much more as a share of your income on shoes for your kids, food, things like that. Whereas higher-income households may be buying vacations, which are not tariffed.

Rosin: Right. Are there some surprises that Americans might have in store? Like, things that you found are likely to go up way more than we expect? Things that I maybe don‚Äôt even associate with China or know are made in China?

Gimbel: To some extent, a lot of this is quote-unquote ‚Äúobvious,‚Äù right? We are expecting the big hit to be on clothing, for example. I think a lot of people realize that their clothes are not made in the United States. I think the thing that is going to be harder for people is: Even things that are made in the United States may buy inputs from abroad, right? So just because you‚Äôve made the effort to find something that is produced in the United States doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre not getting cotton, silk, wood‚Äîwhatever it is‚Äîfrom outside the United States.

Rosin: So when you look at the landscape, are you thinking very few things are exempt from this? Like, most things are gonna be more expensive?

Gimbel: I mean, services, technically‚Äî

Rosin: Yes?

Gimbel: ‚Äîshould be exempt from tariffs. Although, we did just see the president announce that they‚Äôre going to be tariffing movies. I‚Äôm not entirely sure how that would work. But, you know, in general, I think there are very few parts of the goods-producing economy that we are expecting not to be hit.

And I think one thing that‚Äôs important to keep in mind, right, is: Say that you are, by some miracle, a domestic producer who is totally insulated from this, right? You buy your fabric from a nice fabric producer down the road who gets everything in the United States, etcetera. Why would you not raise your prices, right? So all of your competitors have to raise their prices by, let‚Äôs say, 10 percent in the face of tariffs. You can raise your prices by 8 percent, still get a lot of market share, and get the benefit of those higher prices. And so we do also expect even domestic producers to raise the prices.",2,1746801415.0,atlanticdiscussions,2,1.0,False

Hey, RetirementReady fam! You ever find yourself thinking, ‚ÄúWow, I feel better now than I did ten years ago?‚Äù üôå Seriously, who knew that throwing in some healthy habits and having fun would make us feel so alive in our 50s and beyond? 

So, I've been reflecting on what makes this stage of life truly vibrant. Here are some of my personal vitality secrets, and I'd love to hear yours too!

### **1. Move Your Body (But Don‚Äôt Kill Yourself)**üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Okay, let‚Äôs be real. The days of running marathons in our 20s might be behind us, but that doesn't mean we can‚Äôt enjoy moving! 

- **Find what you love:** Dance like nobody's watching, or take up gardening (trust me, it's a workout!). 
- **Mix it up:** Walk, hike, swim, or try yoga. Variety keeps it exciting! 

### **2. Nourish Your Inner Foodie** üçè
Remember when we could eat anything without consequences? Yeah, those days are over. So, let‚Äôs embrace this new food adventure with open arms. 

- **Explore new recipes:** Try adding more colorful veggies to your meals. Bonus points for making them Instagram-worthy! 
- **Mindful eating:** Take a moment to admire your food and savor every bite. Who knew you could find joy in a Brussels sprout? 

### **3. Socialize Like Your Life Depends On It** ü•≥
Life‚Äôs too short to not enjoy it with others! Surround yourself with positive influences.

- **Join clubs or groups:** Book clubs, knitting circles, or community projects can spark new friendships. 
- **Plan regular hangouts with friends:** Grab coffee or even have a weekly game night. Laughter is seriously the best medicine! 

### **4. Set Realistic Goals** üéØ
I heard this saying recently ‚Äî *‚ÄúSet realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.‚Äù* Ain‚Äôt that the truth? 

- **Small steps lead to big achievements:** Want to travel? Instead of planning a month-long trip, how about a weekend getaway? 
- **Celebrate wins, no matter how small:** Finished a book? Cheers to you! Walking 10,000 steps today? You‚Äôre a superstar! 

### **5. Cultivate Your Mind** üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Keep that brain engaged! It‚Äôs a muscle that needs some love, too.

- **Read, learn, grow:** Whether it‚Äôs books, podcasts, or online courses, there‚Äôs a whole world waiting for you! 
- **Do puzzles or play games:** Challenge your mind and have fun while doing it. Ever played cards against humanity with the grandkids? Hilarious! 

So there you have it! My little recipe for feeling fantastic in our 50s and beyond. Life is too wonderful to settle for anything less than vibrant and full of energy.

Stopped in to the airport lounges and I have some initial thoughts.

Centurion: closest after passing through security checkpoint. Maybe same size as PHL airport lounge? Breakfast buffet was small and had hash browns, scrambled eggs, sausage links, biscuits, and like a casserole quiche thing with ham.  On par with other centurion lounge foods. This location does have a speakeasy downstairs too, but the best thing to me was the coffee bar where you can order coffee and smoothies and such. Nice staff.

Virign Atlantic: used the priority pass for access. Spacious and feels like I‚Äôm at some kind of London night club (maybe idk, I‚Äôve never been to London) with darkish mood lighting. Sat in a plush couch thing and a server came by and explain the menu you scan by QR code. Some items are complimentary and others have price indicated. 

Delta Sky Club: the one by A gates. Top tier sky club. Really spacious and clean. Felt like I was at some kind of fancy hotel or something. Has the outdoor patio area too.They should use this location in promo images for advertising sky club accesses. Standard sky club breakfast foods. Eggs and sausage not as good as centurion lounge, but at least the coffee machine was not out of order. I‚Äôd put this particular spot top 5 at least for all the other sky clubs including LGA, SLC, and MSP.

Chase: couldn‚Äôt get in as I‚Äôve already used my complimentary visit for the year üò≠. If it‚Äôs anything like the Sapphire lounge at Logan, then it‚Äôs elite.

I start chemo in a week & a half, so I‚Äôm treating this coming week as treatment boot camp. I want to prepare practically, emotionally, mentally & physically. 
    
I saw someone mention in a comment on another post that she made a list of all her chemo meds‚Äô possible side effects & got stuff together to combat them ahead of time. This is genius bc who is really trying to search up the best chemo face rash cream & sort by ‚Äòfastest delivery‚Äô when they‚Äôre itchy af? No one.  
  
So I did that yesterday- all 4 of my meds are going to cause diarrhea (of course lol I had no illusions otherwise) so Imodium was high on the list; some will cause muscle pain so I‚Äôll be talking to my doctor about epsom salts; etc.   
    
This organization & taking action made me feel calmer, so today I got a jump on practicing my scarf tying & accessorizing (fyi, a flowy-at-the-ends scarf worn with hoop earrings make me look like a pirate, so thank god I did this dry run üòÇ)    
   
I‚Äôm now thinking about the chemo time itself. I was thinking about getting some loose matching separates - think Oprah on a casual Tuesday morning at some garden estate. Comfy, cozy & classic with easy access to whatever they have to get to. But I haven‚Äôt found any that would give easy access to my port, so I guess a button down? Any suggestions are welcome.   
    
I‚Äôll have needlepoint, a book, an iPhone & a friend with me for my infusion time. Should I bring my own blanket & pillow for a nap? Can I roll in with an iced coffee?   
    
Since the scarf/hoop combo looked silly on me, I was also looking for head covering options you‚Äôve come across & liked recently. I checked out a few threads here but they were older, so I wanted to see if there was anything fresh on the market that I should check out. I‚Äôll be in chemo all summer & I can‚Äôt imagine wanting to wear wigs daily. Ya girl will be going through menopause as is üò© hats aren‚Äôt usually my thing & it‚Äôs windy where I live so a lot of hats make me nervous. I love turbans but am open!   
    
And last but not least - as i mentioned, I‚Äôm starting an Oh Shit Kit (just made that name up as I typed it. I like it) for potential symptoms. Anyone who wants to drop miracle recs for common drug symptoms, pls do. I‚Äôm not talking ‚Äòthis helped a little with neuropathy‚Äô or ‚Äòthis took a slight edge off my nausea‚Äô, I‚Äôm talking ‚ÄòTHIS SAVED MY HAPPINESS FOR 4 MONTHS‚Äô üòÇ I don‚Äôt want to clog the threat with everything everyone touched during their treatment that was ‚Äòok‚Äô, I want to know what‚Äôs most worth having in my sick life.

I was initiated into Shambhavi several years ago and have practiced the meditation intermittently. My practice fell off last year and I started consuming coffee about 6 months ago. Now I am addicted to caffeine (I need about 300-400mg just to feel normal in the morning). I want to get back into the practice and I want to quit caffeine but I am having trouble with it and seeking guidance from the community.

When I first wake up I feel terrible because of caffeine withdrawal. Every morning I think about my morning sadhana and doing Angamardana, Surya Kriya, and Shambhavi, but I can't imagine even doing just Shambhavi the way I am feeling. So I go and have my caffeine, but then I know I am not supposed to do the sadhana after that because of the stimulant in my system.

I'm trying to step down off the caffeine but it is a slow process (I've outright quit in the past but when I do I feel terrible for weeks and can't afford that right now so I'm trying to step down slowly). In the meantime, when should I have my sadhana? My understanding is I should wait at least 1.5 hours after drinking something other than water, but is that different with caffeine? Should I wait longer? Would it be better to do the sadhana in the evening? Is it okay to do sadhana in the evening?

I know the daily stimulant use is taxing my energy system, but it will probably take me a month to gradually step down from it so I can be off it entirely and I'd like to start my sadhana before that. Please advise as how to restart my sadhana safely.",2,1746800960.0,Sadhguru,4,1.0,False

1kijsh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kijsh0/can_the_cosori_co162cwm_mug_warmer_redefine_your/,Can the COSORI CO162-CWM mug warmer redefine your coffee routine review?,"The COSORI CO162-CWM Coffee Mug Warmer & Mug Set has been an interesting gadget to experiment with. Ever since I got my hands on it, my daily tea and coffee ritual has transformed. For someone who constantly forgets about their drink while working, this product promises to solve an age-old problem. With its sleek stainless steel design, precise temperature control, and specialized mug, it seems like a dream come true. But as with all products, there are layers of pros and cons to peel back.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
One of the standout features of this coffee warmer set is its stylish and compact design. The stainless steel material lends it a premium look and ensures durability. The mug, crafted from 304 food-grade stainless steel, looks elegant in black and silver and fits comfortably in your hand. I especially appreciated the heat-resistant handle‚Äîit‚Äôs both practical and feels nice to grip. With its overall size of 5.3‚ÄùL x 4.3‚ÄùW x 0.7‚ÄùH, the warmer doesn‚Äôt dominate my desk space and is effortlessly portable. However, the mug's lid bothered me; it doesn‚Äôt seal, making this unsuitable for anyone aiming to use it as a travel mug.

**Touch Screen Operations and Display**  
The digital display is clear, easy to navigate, and modern. Setting temperatures between 77-194¬∞F is simple, thanks to its touchscreen controls. The accurate temperature readings (precise to 1¬∞) make a big difference. I enjoyed switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit modes, making it flexible for personal preferences. While these features are genuinely impressive, the glowing red light while the base is powered off can feel particularly intrusive in a dimly lit room.

**Perks of a High-Tech Heating Element**  
The efficiency of the Pi film heating element is remarkable. Unlike old-school warmers that felt like glorified coasters, this one keeps beverages consistently warm. Over the weeks of testing, my coffee maintained a noticeably stable temperature without overheating or scorching. I must say, navigating long workdays without resorting to the microwave for reheats felt luxurious. However, even minor spills can lead to a buildup of gunk under the lid, which isn‚Äôt ideal for lazy cleaners like me.

[Check COSORI CO162-CWM price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07g9j4745/)

**Adjustable Temperature Control**  
Having control over the beverage‚Äôs warmth is game-changing. The maximum temperature kept my coffee hotter than I expected. My husband, who enjoys his drinks piping hot, was thrilled when I set the mug to max. On cooler days, the moderate settings were just perfect for my herbal tea. A word of caution is needed here: the heating plate does stay hot for a while even after it‚Äôs powered off. I found myself accidentally touching it once‚Äîlesson learned.

**Good Points**  
- Impressive temperature precision allows me to cater to different beverage preferences.  
- Durable stainless steel design with a stylish, modern feel.  
- Compact build makes it a great fit for desks and kitchens alike.  
- Easy-to-clean surface minimizes maintenance efforts.  

**Limitations**  
- The lid isn‚Äôt spill-proof and feels restrictive for travel purposes.  
- The entire base can get excessively warm, posing a potential risk.  
- Lack of a built-in timer means users have to remember to power it off manually.  

**Competing Brands in the Market**  
It would be unfair not to compare this product to other similar beverage warmers. I‚Äôve previously tried the Vobaga VOB-10, which has a comparable warming function but felt underwhelming in build quality. The COSORI set significantly outshines it with its sturdy construction and food-grade material. However, the Ember Mug, known for app-controlled settings, offers competition in terms of advanced features but at a higher price point. While the COSORI doesn‚Äôt offer smart connectivity, it strikes a balance between affordability and utility, positioning itself well for budget-conscious consumers.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Assessing the cost-versus-benefit equation here, I‚Äôd confidently say you get solid value for what you pay. The stainless steel mug is sturdy, the features are more advanced than common cup warmers, and the aesthetics are sleek. However, it‚Äôs important to note that some competitors provide slightly more convenience, albeit at higher prices. For functional daily use and gifting, this set ticks most boxes efficiently.

I have a partner but I date women on the side on a very casual note. I really *really* like women but I have this issue where somehow it just turns to friends... 

Like now, I matched this awesome girl who is sooooo my type and we went on a coffee date and it went alright but then there was a dinner date and it went amazing. I wanted to kiss her but idk I chickened out. We were both open about not wanting something serious and just seeing where it leads. 

Anyway I was away for work for 7 weeks and the convo died out. I just came back and texted her and we are going out again, to drinks. 

I am very into her but afraid to scare her off. To top that off I feel like it was not the right time to disclose my male partner but now feels too late. Also since it was casual and non exclusive I didn't feel the need to be all ""yo I got a boyfriend"".

What would you do? And how do you even flirt at all when you are both femmes?

Aaron arranged four clean plates with utensils on his small kitchen table. He laid out rolls and softened butter before looking at the wall clock. Caleb and Zina would be over soon. He had invited them to Sunday dinner at his apartment. Usually, they would eat at his parent's house after church but they needed to talk about what happened between Zina and Chloe. Chloe had had a terrible anxiety attack last night, hyperventilating and unable to sleep for hours convinced that Zina hated her. Aaron's heart hurt for Chloe. Chloe could be withdrawn and awkward to those who didn't know her well. He knew how sensitive she was but he also knew Zina wasn't a bad person. Clearly things had gotten out of control last night. He wanted, no he needed for them to get along. 

Zina was like an older sister to him. She had always been there since he could remember and she meant a lot to him and the family. Chloe was the woman he loved. He could see a future with Chloe, maybe a family of his own with her one day. His thoughts raced as he removed the store bought lasagna from the oven. Chloe prepared a salad with a nervous expression on her face as she stood next to Aaron. Aaron reassured her that everything would be okay once they talked the situation out. Chloe looked skeptical reminding Aaron that Zina had cussed at her and stormed out, refusing further discussion. Before Aaron could respond a firm knocking vibrated the door. Chloe shifted nervously from foot to foot as Aaron gave her a calming smile before looking through the peephole. 

It was Caleb holding a bottle of red wine and Zina holding a homemade apple pie. Aaron opened the door and greeted his brother and Zina warmly. Chloe stood awkwardly by the table greeting them both softly. Zina rushed over and placed the pie carefully on the table and looked at Chloe before grabbing her hands. Chloe instinctively tried to pull away but Zina held her hands firmly, smiling kindly with tears in her eyes. 

""Oh my God Chloe, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I had way too much to drink and got frustrated after you kept mentioning the dress over and over. Even after I told you multiple times it was okay and I wasn't upset. I shouldn't have gotten so angry and used profanity though. Please forgive me Chloe! I'm really, really sorry. I just want us to be friends."" Zina said with tears welling in her eyes. 

Chloe stood there frozen, her anger growing inside. She stared at Aaron who smiled brightly shaking his head in approval. Caleb looked confused but remained quiet as he placed the wine on the kitchen counter. 

""Chloe, do you forgive me?"" Zina repeated letting a single tear escape her eye and roll down her flawless face. 

Chloe forced a smile. 

""Of course! Of course ai forgive you Zina...let's just put this behind us."" She said suppressing the urge to lash out. 

Zina snatched her hands away and hugged Chloe tightly. She released her after a few seconds and gave her a quick, smug smile before turning her attention back to Aaron, complimenting him on the table setup. Chloe stood there fuming before taking a seat at the table. She dug her fingernails into her thigh under the table while Aaron walked over, bending down to kiss her on the cheek and whisper in her ear. 

""See honey, that worked out better than you thought. I told you everything would be okay"" Aaron whispered happily. 

Chloe smiled weakly, shaking her head in agreement. She looked over and made eye contact with Zina who smiled at her warmly. She dug her nails deeper into her flesh breaking skin. 

*Zina & Caleb*

Caleb pulled out of the parking lot of Aaron's apartment complex. He looked over at Zina who had a satisfied look on her face. 

""Babe, what the hell was that in there?"" He asked. 

""Whatcha talking about?"" She asked, looking at him. 

""Those fake ass tears and overdramatic apology?"" He said snickering. 

Zina laughed loudly. 

""Oh, you could tell huh?"" 

""Yeah, you never apologize like that."" He stated matter of factly. 

""True...I was just turning the tables."" She responded. 

""You want to tell me what happened now? You didn't say much last night when you came in upset."" Caleb said crossing lanes. 

Zina explained in detail everything that happened with Chloe. She also told him about the conversation she had with Bea before going home. It was Bea who had warned Zina that Chloe would play the victim. She advised Zina to pull a uno reverse and beat her to the punch. 

*""Girl, stand up for yourself. Show her you see what she's about.""* Bea had said. 

""Do you want me to talk to Aaron about this? If Chloe is being...weird he needs to know."" Caleb asked concerned. 

""Nah, she's just immature. She's probably trying to establish dominance or something ignorant like that. Aaron seems happy...as long as things don't escalate it's fine."" Zina said reassuring Caleb. 

*Chloe & Aaron*

Aaron kissed Chloe deeply running his hand under her shirt. His lips moved slowly to her neck. Chloe pulled away, looking him in his eyes. 

""What's wrong honey?"" He asked. 

""I ran out of my birth control. Do you have protection?"" She asked. 

""Crap! I forgot to restock..."" He said looking disappointed. 

Chloe kissed him passionately, pulling him closer before pulling away. 

""Go and get some from the drug store before it closes."" She said seductively. 

Aaron smiled widely and quickly jumped up from the sofa grabbing his keys and wallet before heading out of the apartment. Chloe opened her purse and slid her birth control pack between her checkbook inside of her wallet. She threw her purse angrily back on the coffee table as she thought about Zina's display and that smug little smile she gave. She abruptly stood up and stormed into the bathroom. She splashed cold water on her face as she tried to calm herself down. Anger soared through her chest as her heart rate increased. She gripped the sides of the sink tightly and let out a demented scream. She stared at her self in the mirror, her face cherry red, her eyes wild with hatred as water dripped from a few strands of her hair. 

""That fucking bitch! I'm going to destroy her!"" She said shaking violently.

1kijjh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyLive/comments/1kijjh3/is_rip_van_wafels_chocolate_hazelnut_mini_wafer/,Is Rip Van Wafels Chocolate Hazelnut Mini Wafer the Ultimate Low-Sugar Snack Review?,"The Rip Van Wafels B0CDQF5Z8S Rip Van Chocolate Hazelnut Mini Wafer Cookies are a mix of convenience, health-conscious design, and indulgent flavor. Having tested them as my go-to snack over the past week, I can confidently share the intricacies of this product. Here‚Äôs an honest, firsthand review, with some brownie points for its strengths and a few reservations about the weaknesses.

**A Snacker‚Äôs Dream for Quick, Guilt-Free Bites**  
During my hectic mornings, these wafers were a lifesaver. With only 1 gram of sugar and no trans fats, it felt good enjoying a snack that didn‚Äôt leave me feeling sluggish afterward. For someone like me, who tries to cut down on sugar but loves chocolate, this hit just the right spot. Their compact, individually wrapped format made throwing one into my bag super convenient ‚Äì whether I was heading into a meeting, gym session, or even on a day trip with friends.  

**Snackability That Can‚Äôt Be Overlooked**  
One of the highlights of these wafers is that they feel entirely designed for portability. Not a crumb out of place, they‚Äôre light yet satisfying. I‚Äôve tried my fair share of wafer-style snacks, but few have struck this neat balance between texture and dietary consideration. Imagine walking into work and pulling this out between coffee sips‚Äîsuper satisfying without the calorie overload. 

[Want the Rip Van Wafels B0CDQF5Z8S? Check Amazon pricing here.](https://theveggieshop.com/p/b0cdqf5z8s/)

**Natural Ingredients for a Clean Taste**  
Here‚Äôs something that genuinely resonated with me. No artificial colors, no preservatives, no soy ‚Äî that‚Äôs a big win, particularly since so many snacks can‚Äôt claim that anymore. You know that fleeting sense of guilt when snacking? Yeah, these took that feeling right off the table for me. Ingredients felt clean and really contributed to authentic flavor‚Äîthere was no synthetic aftertaste either. Cocoa and hazelnut pieces shine through in each bite, making it feel like a premium experience without a luxury price tag.  

**Benefits**  
- Only 1 gram of sugar offers a guilt-free snacking option.  
- Individually wrapped wafers are perfect for portion control (or hoarding snacks in my drawer).  
- Authentic taste from real hazelnut pieces.  
- Fiber-packed, which helped curb hunger until lunch.  

**Some Hurdles in the Product**  
While it‚Äôs a solid product, I noticed some spots that could use refining.  

- The packaging is functional but a bit excessive. Those wrappers tend to pile up if you‚Äôre an avid snacker like me.  
- Wafer consistency wasn‚Äôt always consistent. One pack felt crispier than the other, which threw me off.  
- Limited flavor options outside chocolate hazelnut for those on the hunt for variety.  

**Market Rivals Worth Considering**  
Having delved into comparable offerings, these wafers stand uniquely. Brands like KIND and Nature Valley are competitors that cater well to the healthy snack segment, albeit with a slightly different approach. KIND bars, for example, pack denser nutritional ingredients but can feel overly chewy, especially if you‚Äôre after a light bite. Nature Valley, similar in its health-oriented focus, tends to overload on granola textures, which doesn‚Äôt always translate to smooth eating on-the-go. The wafers‚Äô lightweight form factor and indulging yet guilt-free chocolate hazelnut flavor set it apart in this regard. That being said, if crunchier and grain-packed alternatives appeal more to you, Nature Valley could come closer to your preference.

**Quality for Price**  
Determining this product‚Äôs worth comes down to its intent‚Äîproviding a healthier, low-sugar snack option without sacrificing too much integrity in taste. Considering its authenticity and focus on clean eating, I felt I got decent value. While it isn‚Äôt the cheapest in its category, these wafers deliver on their promises without deviating into overly-processed zones. Price-conscious snackers may scoff slightly at single-purpose purchases, but the convenience and dietary alignment surely compensate!
