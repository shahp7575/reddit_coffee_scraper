1nu7dvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtsandthots/comments/1nu7dvk/the_balcony/,The balcony,"I try to live life with as little regrets as possible. It is no use dwelling over the past. But one thing that will forever haunt me is the one balcony in my old house.

The balcony was on the first floor, connected to my study room. The room itself had a giant bookshelf and study table, a whiteboard attached to the wall, a drying rack and a small coffee table tucked away in the corner because it was too ugly for any of the other rooms.

I would actually spend a lot of time in the room studying, doing homework or arts and crafts. It was completely MY room, no one else has any reason to ever go there. 

There was a giant window that didnt let in direct sunlight but it let in so much air, you'd feel like you were living under a windmill. The balcony itself faced a giant 4 storey house in the front and an abandoned lot in the right. The lot was green and filled with wild plants. It wasn't very big but it gave a nice break from the otherwise view of concrete and asphalt.

I remember how happy it made me to sit in the balcony during sunset. In retrospect, I only did this a few times. Maybe it was because the door was slightly jammed or maybe I just forgot, but I definitely didn't go out there as much as I should have. 

I feel a deep regret, almost as if I let it down by never admiring it's true beauty. But the balcony still stands (if the house still exists) and it probably still gives the same view and the same cool breeze to anyone lucky enough to stand there. It is almost as if my regret has no effect on the balcony itself, because it always knew its worth, I am the only one who failed to see it. 

I will live in regret while nothing has changed for the balcony itself. Maybe it's railings have oxidised a bit more, or maybe there is some sludge built up due to the rain. It never was the best place in the world, and it will not even be the best place I will visit in my lifetime, but that's not the point. It's beauty is in its availability and mundaneness. It was always right there.

If I could go back to the past and change something, I would sit in the balcony more often. I wish I could go there once again and feel the wind one last time.",1,1759219632.0,thoughtsandthots,0,1.0,False
1nu7dfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nu7dfw/lost_a_month_of_my_life_in_a_gambling_coma_but/,"Lost a month of my life in a ""gambling coma"" but now I'm awake.","I am going to try make this as short and concise as I possibly can... 

I have never made a post of any kind on any platform but I need to get this out there. Last month I had a lot of time of work, It was the start of my annual leave. Poker is a game I love to play so I deposited on a site and after a couple of weeks I was down around 350 dollars, It wasn't going too well and I randomly found myself on the casino section of the site, looking back now it was just frustration and I was thinking I'll make my money back this way. I'll fast track through the bullshit, this was nearly a month ago now as I type this and I now find myself in a position to put a deposit on a house which is insane.

Now, the casino games in question was all just slot machines and I have spun that button at least a few hundred thousand times since this all started. I have been through torment throughout this whole thing, why you ask? Didn't you just say you won enough to put down a deposit for a house? Yes I did say that, but what I haven't told you was that i nearly lost it all so many times only to be 'saved' time and time again with another big win by betting crazy amount on each spin. After another big win yesterday morning I have proceeded to give around 5 thousand dollars back to the casino since then, around 2 thousand of that was before I decided to write this post. 

  
Right before I won that mega win yesterday morning I was throwing away everything I had won before on 600 dollar spins praying with tears in my eyes having an absolute freakout while I pressed that button, risking my future prospects of getting a home for myself, my heart was racing! I'm having strong anxiety right now while typing thinking about it even though I won and as I mentioned up above some of that money has now gone back to the casino, that's a nice holiday, a new car, money for my children, whatever way you wanna.... excuse the pun now 'spin' it, it was money I could have used to good effect that I wont get back. 

During this whole thing I have completely lost myself, cant think of anything else but spinning that slot machine. I have to go back to work in a few days now and back to reality. Even though I am now done with this whole thing I don't feel mentally well, I'm not naive to think that I'm golden now, I know I'm in for a few rough days/weeks ahead knowing I cant press that button and there's the KEY point of that sentence I realize now that it was all about pressing that button and waiting for that HIT, that rush, when you win big and just look at the screen for a few mins and realize that you just won an amount of money that would take months to earn in your job. And then after that euphoria proceed to slowly give it all back in drips and drabs and the panic starts all over again.

  
My brain is totally fried, it's not normal for it to feel complete joy and then seconds ..... yes seconds later feel complete and utter misery. It's not equipped to handle that, Its like I was purposely trying to give the money back because I didn't wanna do this anymore even though that money means so much to me, I'm not a rich man by any means and had no savings really at all prior to this, I live on a run down council estate and nobody around here has anything. Try think of those youtube videos, 'living on benefits' or 'skint' People in the UK and Ireland will understand that reference probably more to be honest, my point is I've never had much. 

I have been given a gift to be honest and I'm starting to throw it all away again, woke up at 4am this morning, made a coffee and straight away on my phone on the app and Lost an additional 2 thousand dollars, \* deep breaths\* I feel like a scumbag for doing that, even though I know I'm a decent guy, I'm guessing that's what this does to you in the long term, plays with your emotions like a yo yo. I have completely lost the value or concept of money throughout this journey, almost not recognizing that that is real money on the screen and not play money or monopoly money, its the money that's gonna get me out of a huge hole and give me the means of getting my own actual fucking home and I'm there pressing some button like a zombie with no thought process and trying to kill that dream..... no, sorry for the language but fuck that, I couldn't cope with life going forward if I threw away that money and that's the only truth I really need to say to myself. I have also smoked around a billion cigarettes during this out of complete stress and I never felt so physically ill than I have in the last 30 days, I just want to go back to being me again, you know that feeling?

  
Anyway, lol sorry I tried to make it as short as possible but I'd be willing to answer any questions anybody might have in the comment section if I get any questions on this post to clarify further. In conclusion I don't feel like I have ""beat the casino"" or whatever term people use but I am walking away now with what's left, in terms of money and more importantly my mind. 

If I help even one person with this post then that will make me happier than any win on any slot machine or casino game could ever give me. And that's the real Jackpot prize, never forget that.

1nu7bzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductOwner/comments/1nu7bzm/rant_about_what_made_me_create_a_first_sample_out/,Rant about what made me create a first sample out of own expierence,"Let’s start at the beginning.We’re a young family, and like hundreds of thousands of other parents, we’re busy. So far, a very normal story.

Unfortunately, our daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 3 (she’s 4 now). An autoimmune disease that stops her body from producing insulin.

This immediately had a massive impact on our family. On our relationship. And no one warns you about the constant worries that come with it. The little time we had became even scarcer.

Our mindset changed, too. As parents, you always try to be a role model but now, even more so. We became much more conscious of what we eat. We were already active, but now we deliberately promote a healthy lifestyle. Evening workouts. No alcohol. No processed foods. No coffee.
And we can feel the difference: more energy, feeling fitter, even had to tighten the belt one notch.

But then I looked in my closet and noticed that the years had taken a toll, especially on the things you don’t really seeeven though you use them almost every day.

My socks were worn out. Some had holes. Others were too small, too thin, or too thick. It was awful.

They just didn’t fit anymore.
So I went to the store but I couldn’t find socks that matched my lifestyle.I don’t want to switch socks multiple times a day. I go to the office, I work, I exercise in the evening, play with my daughter, head out to the garden or park.
I need socks that are:
* Thin enough for the office
* Breathable enough for sports shoes
* Durable enough to play in
* And affordable

Sure, you can buy anything these days, but spending €100 on a pair of socks just seems ridiculous.

I searched online, too but it wasn’t easy.
* Sports socks get stiff fast and are often thick
* Running socks slip when you play
* Thin socks well they are just thinn and I don’t like that.

And playing with my daughter is something I truly care about.

After a long search, I realized: there simply isn’t a sock that ticks all these boxes.
- breathable design
- cushioned on toes and heel
- regular colors ( I want easy and not having to spend time on matching all different colors and designs together)

So I used my 10+ years of product knowledge to create my own sample.That process alone is a whole story in itself...

But the first samples we’ve developed are now on their way.I’m so excited

1nu77mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cognitivesupport/comments/1nu77mx/how_i_started_a_fibrefirst_breakfast_for_calmer/,How I started a “fibre-first” breakfast for calmer focus (beat the coffee jitters in 7 days),"I used to drink coffee on an empty stomach before feeling confused about why my concentration levels dropped at 11 am. I adopted a basic dietary rule two months ago, which required me to eat fibre before consuming caffeine. My energy levels became more consistent after one week of following this practice, while eliminating my daily mid-morning energy dip.

**What I actually did (7-day reset):**

I began my day with 1 bowl of Greek yoghurt containing 150g, along with chopped apple, 2 tbsp oats and 1 tbsp milled flax and a handful of berries for three days. I drank my coffee between thirty and forty-five minutes following my meal.

I replaced yoghurt with eggs and wholegrain toast and grilled tomatoes on alternate days from days 4 to 7. I followed the practice of drinking coffee only after eating my meals.

I needed to drink at least 500 ml of water before starting my breakfast.

Taking 200–400 mg of magnesium glycinate before bed helps with sleep relaxation when your rest is disrupted.

**Why it helped me:**

The combination of fibre and protein before caffeine consumption helped my blood sugar levels rise gradually while delaying the onset of coffee effects, which produced sustained energy levels. The combination of yoghurt and eggs provided protein and fat, which sustained my hunger, while oats, flax, apple and berries delivered viscous fibre and polyphenols that controlled blood sugar fluctuations and reduced nervousness. 

The consumption of coffee following a meal prevented the typical adrenaline rush that occurs when the stomach is empty, thus I maintained focus without experiencing hand tremors or racing thoughts. The initial 500 ml water intake addressed my morning dehydration, which often affects attention and mood clarity. The use of magnesium glycinate before bed improved my sleep quality, which resulted in better concentration during the following day.

**Single-day check-in**

Breakfast picked (exact items): 150 g Greek yoghurt, 1 medium apple (chopped), 2 tbsp oats (\~20 g), 1 tbsp milled flax, handful of mixed berries

Notes — what helped / what hindered:

Fibre-first + coffee-after felt steady; short walk bumped alertness. A late email check raised stress; timer blocks helped.

1nu73s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nu73s0/whats_the_real_difference_between_espresso/,What's the real difference between espresso machine types?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been a barista for over 7 years, and I'm constantly asked about espresso machines. After trying countless machines and helping hundreds of customers, I thought I'd share what I've learned about the different types out there.

First off, let's break down the main types of espresso machines you'll encounter:

Manual/Lever Machines:
These are the old-school ones where you physically pull a lever to force hot water through the coffee grounds. They're beautiful and give you complete control, but they're not for everyone. You'll need serious practice to get consistent shots.

Semi-Automatic Machines:
These are what I personally use at home. You grind the coffee, tamp it, and press a button to start/stop the water flow. They're perfect for learning the craft while having some automated features. I recently found a great deal on one here: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine

Automatic Machines:
These do most of the work for you. Just press a button, and they'll stop the shot automatically based on pre-programmed volumes. Great for consistency but less control over your shot.

Super-Automatic Machines:
Think of these as the ""press and forget"" options. They do everything - grinding, tamping, brewing, and even milk frothing. Perfect for busy mornings but you sacrifice some quality for convenience.

Pod/Capsule Machines:
These use pre-packaged coffee pods. They're super convenient but usually can't match the quality of traditional machines. Plus, those pods aren't great for the environment.

Here's what really matters when choosing:

Price Range:
- Manual: $400-1000+
- Semi-Auto: $200-2000
- Automatic: $400-3000
- Super-Auto: $500-5000+
- Pod: $100-500

I've found some great deals on various types here: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine

Build Quality:
The boiler type is crucial. Single boilers are fine for occasional use, but if you make multiple drinks, look for dual boilers or heat exchangers. They let you brew and steam simultaneously.

Pressure:
Good machines maintain 9 bars of pressure during extraction. Some cheaper ones advertise ""15 bars!"" but that's actually not better.

Learning Curve:
Be honest about how much time you want to invest in learning. There's no shame in getting a super-automatic if you just want good coffee without the fuss.

Maintenance:
All machines need cleaning and descaling. Super-automatics often need more frequent maintenance despite being easier to use.

Space:
Some machines are huge! Measure your counter space before falling in love with a machine.

After years of experience, I'd say semi-automatic machines offer the best balance of control, quality, and price for most people. But there's no ""perfect"" machine - it depends on your lifestyle, budget, and how serious you are about espresso.

Feel free to ask any specific questions about machines you're considering. I love helping people find their perfect coffee setup!",1,1759218530.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1nu73jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nu73jz/my_relationship_with_dance/,My relationship with dance,"This Sunday, I was strolling past a busy street for an errand. Side stepping people, evading oncoming vehicles and making my way through a crowd. Pavements are still a concept in India. Mopeds, bikes and autos will fight for every inch of the tarmac and ground besides it to get ahead. It's pretty much like the first five seconds from lights off, in the Formula 1 starting grid. And everyone is trying to be Verstappen trying to ace the first corner. 

I passed by some music. Not just any music. Quintessential Bollywood music for Garba. The kind that hijacks your feet, shoulders, and neck all at once. The thumps of the bass speakers were resonating with my insides. It wasn't the song or the volume. it was the fact that a group nearby was dancing not too far away me. Just knowing that, got to me. I wanted to just pause my day and be in that moment. I wanted to soak it in.

There was coffee place nearby. I stepped in, ordered a coffee and stood next to the entrance, leaned against a wall and planted my gaze at the general direction of the music. The song was Shubhaarambh from Kai Po Che. Festivity, joy and celebration squeezed into music and lyrics. The song just hits you in the right spot. It's one thing to listen to a song in your headphones or watch a video on Youtube. But to listen to such a song in full blast, with people dancing to it, smiles and sweat all around - it is something inexplainable. It simultaneously gives you mental zoomies, and also brings a lot of... calm and quiet. That's the weird and beautiful thing about music and dance. There's a lot of calm in chaos. Why calm you ask? It isolates you from the real noise.. the noise of your mundane life.

Anyone who knew me back in the day, would know that dance was a part of my identity. Dancing brought out a version of me that doesn't exist in my day to day's. Whenever I fought through the stage fright and social anxiety to dance, it felt gooooood. It gave me an out. It made me.. more. It's like the raw ingredients coming together over flames, bringing out flavors that didn't exist! That was me when the groove got me.

I don't dance anymore. I'm not even sure if I remember how to. Long gone are the years where I'd attempt to learn the steps of Bollywood dance sequences. But I feel behind a decade old worth of mental blocks, there's a version of me who grooves whenever he listens to a hint of groovy music. He still wears a black fedora. The one who constantly tries to choreograph songs I feed to my ears. If I had a way to project what goes into that part of my mind into Instagram, it would be clips from a huge dance festival where there's nothing but a slew of dance sequences involving me and lots of people. And it's Non-stop! Songs after songs. Lots of Love mera hit hit. Lots of Hookahbar. Lots of Dheeme Dheeme. A fair bit of Kar Gai Chul and London Thumakda as well. Mix in some Dangerous from MJ and Ride it from Jay Sean. Sean Paul's Temprature was not skipped.

As I'm sipping my coffee and listening to the song shuffle at a distance, I'm dancing in my mind. And my head isn't even trying to hide the fact that I'm enjoying the music. My feet are having an identity crisis. They are yelling at me. ""Why are you standing Nitin? Chogada Taara is playing and you have planted us? Who even are you?""

But that is something I've been listening to for a decade and more. Not just from my feet, but people around me. I've refused to come and dance. Garba nights? Haven’t attended since college. Weddings? Only the occasional baraati duty shuffle. Parties? Politely skipped. Even dancing alone in my room feels weird so I stopped doing it. Do I feel bad? Yes I do. Will I feel better if I dance again? Maybe I don't know. Can I do anything about it? No. Cuz beyond romanticizing dance, I'm now a whole another person. Dancing has evolved so much right in front of my eyes and I've failed to catch up. All I can do is watch others dance, applaud and move on.

I'm trying to dissect the reasons why that is. Maybe more than skill, it's this self-conscious realization that maybe I'm just not good at it. Maybe I was never good at it, and I just did it and people rolled with it. I tend to cringe remembering my past performances. My mind doesn't go easy on me. My internal monologues can sound very damaging and harsh. ""You won't be able to match the tempo Nitin, back off"" ""With that receding hairline people are gonna scuff at you dude. Don't step onto the floor"" ""You are old. Let the younglings dance... don't you sign up for that dance workshop"".

It’s harsh, but my brain has always been that way. And yet, I love watching others dance. Doesn’t matter if they’re good, bad, or simply possessed. When others let loose, I cheer them on. But myself? Nope. In my own eyes, I don’t make the cut. There's this standard that I have set for myself, which I am not able to meet. And if I can't meet it, why even try? Hypocritical? Absolutely. Normal? Probably. Tragic? A little.

I finish my coffee and start walking. As the music fades behind me I blend into the crowd. And as I slowly walk past people around me, my mind is running. Observing people around me. An elderly gentleman wearing a faded green kurta, watching his step around a rock. Maybe he once danced in high school before life took over. A lady trying to manage her three kids and her saree's pallu, maybe she once did Kathak and had to quit. The guy with the worn out shirt, who is walking his cycle beside me? Perhaps he won some dance trophies at school and now he is a slave to the routine of life. Or maybe they all still dance at garba nights, and I’m the only one chickening out. Tbh, I like that possibility better.

But if they don't, are they doing themselves a disservice? I think, No. Many of us stop ourselves from doing things that bring us joy, cuz of our mental blocks. Sure, motivational quotes scream YOLO and dance like nobody’s watching. But the reality? Sometimes you just… can’t, you know. It takes effort and courage to get back on the floor. To write again. To paint again. To travel again. And if you don’t muster it today, that’s okay too. The template of an ideal life cannot be applied on everyone. Often I try to find the outer limits of my empathy. I think it extends to understanding why people may not be able to do what they want to do at this point in their lives. It's nice to be hopeful though. That things may change.

Back in my room, I put on my headphones and hit the play button on a groovy playlist. Mai Sharaabi plays. 

🎶 Kismat meri jagado, Music thoda badha do
Ik patiyala aur pilado, Is party mein aag lagado 🎶

I have a grin in my face. My shoulders are shaking. My head is bobbing. The black fedora Nitin in my mind is busting a kick ass move.

Like I’m so appreciative that my first fender bender the dude wasn’t a jackass but like I feel horrible and this is gonna haunt me. I’ve already started slowing down like a good half mile early when I see a car stopping. And my parents didn’t even give me a lecture or seem remotely upset. They were all like “it was bound to happen”. And like my mom says she’s not gonna say anything to the other kids but I know my mom and she’s gonna tell them and I’m gonna the joke at Christmas this year like i am every year when I make a mistake. I know my siblings are just poking fun at me but I do feel like shit about these things. HOW AM I NOT SUPPOSED TO FEEL BAD ABOUT RAISING MY INSURANCE???? Like my dad called me entitled (which my mom denied but my sister once called me spoiled so I think my mom lied) a few years go and now I can’t stand the fact that my parents might have to pay for MY mistakes. It’s not fair to them. I know they choose this but WHY? WHY was it a few years ago I was supposed to pay for the car damages but didn’t. Why was it a year ago I had to pay for the car damages again but we never even went to fix it? Why is my car damages didn’t even affect my cars body?

I’m once again gonna stress. IM SO THANKFUL FOR THAT DUDE. And if I could buy him coffee or dinner or anything to repay his kindness I FUCKING WOULD ON MY BROKE ASS COLLEGE FUNDS. But like damn.  He prolly just let me go. I know it hasn’t even been a day and he could have taken a photo to file a claim. But why would you tell someone you’re not gonna file then do it anyway? Maybe he was trying to make me feel better. But like he knew that the insurance would hunt me down if it’s noted I got into an accident on my fault. So IDK. I heard his gf on the phone going “that’s not good. That’s not good” and I WAS FREAKING OUT.  But like bro just handed me the paper and said not to worry about it even when I said I’d pay for it. 

Idk. I’m not like upset I’m lucky. But I’m hella confused. Where the fuck did I earn the right to this kinda luck? I feel like a horrible person and don’t understand why I deserved this.

Just when I thought the deal was done, the landlord asked me to share my LinkedIn profile.

At first I laughed, but he was serious. He said he wanted to verify my professional stability. My headline at the time said ""Trying to survive marketing deadlines one coffee at a time."" He actually asked me if coffee deadlines was a real job. I had to explain that I work in digital marketing and not in a cafe.

The funniest part was when he scrolled through my endorsements and said ""At least people have recommended you. That means you are reliable."" I could not believe LinkedIn endorsements were being used to decide if I get a flat.

It also made me wonder. What if I did not even have a LinkedIn profile. Would he have denied me the flat. And what if I had shown someone else’s profile with 500 plus connections and fancy titles. Would he have been more impressed.

The whole thing felt more like a job interview than a flat negotiation.

Those were the good old days — quaint, almost adorable. Now AI writes with tone, context, and conviction. It mimics your CFO, it quotes your last Slack thread, and it makes the word ""urgent"" sound like a legally binding request.

Security vendors and researchers are waving their arms — and rightfully so. AI-crafted social engineering bypasses many traditional heuristics: perfect grammar defeats keyword filters, contextual replies defeat thread-analysis, and voice-cloned voicemail defeats caller-ID suspicion. The result: inboxes full of bespoke lies that sound like they were written by someone who actually knows you.

So what should founders, indie hackers, and wary consultants do other than brew more coffee and publish one more password policy? First: assume compromise is now a feature, not a bug. Your startup's most delicate assets — payroll workflows, vendor approvals, and client data — are the exact surfaces AI attackers will target because they produce high ROI for minimal effort.

Practical, low-fuss steps:
- Protect approval flows with multi-step verification and 'out-of-band' confirmations for transfers and credential changes. Yes, a Slack thread plus an email isn't out-of-band.
- Train humans with real, current simulations. Generic PPTs won't help; use tailored spear-phish simulations that mimic the tone and tools adversaries now use.
- Harden identity: enforce MFA everywhere, prefer hardware keys for key personnel, and reduce standing privileges.
- Monitor for behavior anomalies: AI attacks often create subtle timing and access patterns. Detect those, not just the squeaky obvious payloads.
- Vet vendors for their AI-risk posture. If they use LLMs to handle sensitive data, ask hard questions about logging, retention, and hallucination-handling.

Yes, law enforcement and defenders are adopting AI too — which is refreshing and terrifying in equal measure. Expect faster detection, but also faster escalation and smarter false positives.

Final note: this is not a call for doomscrolling. It's a call for pragmatic paranoia. Design systems assuming persuasion will be automated and ruthlessly efficient.

Here’s How Custom ERP Saves You Money,"Let’s face it—ERP systems are supposed to help businesses run leaner, faster, and smarter. Yet somehow, for many organizations, they end up doing the exact opposite: draining budgets, complicating workflows, and sending CFOs into mild panic attacks every renewal season. If your ERP invoice makes you double-check whether they mistakenly charged you for the neighboring office too, you’re not alone.

At Kanhasoft, we’ve seen this movie before. Companies invest in big-name ERPs, expecting streamlined processes, only to realize they’ve signed up for endless licensing fees, bloated modules they never use, and “mandatory upgrades” that feel more like ransom notes. And here’s the kicker: most of those businesses don’t need 70% of the features they’re paying for.

So, how do you escape the cycle of ERP sticker shock? That’s where [Custom ERP Development](https://kanhasoft.com/erp-software-development.html) swoops in—not as the hero with a cape, but more like the practical partner who shows up with a calculator, a roadmap, and the good sense to cut costs without cutting corners.

# The Real Pain of High ERP Costs

Before we talk solutions, let’s talk pain (because nothing motivates change like numbers in red ink).

# Here are the usual suspects driving ERP costs sky-high:

1. **Licensing & Subscription Fees** – Per-user pricing models often mean you’re paying for seats that sit empty half the year (we’ve seen companies with more licenses than employees).
2. **Unnecessary Features** – Prepackaged ERPs bundle in “advanced” features like blockchain integrations or aerospace-grade logistics, even if you’re just managing a mid-sized distribution network.
3. **Customization Premiums** – Ironically, trying to customize off-the-shelf ERP often costs more than building your own from scratch.
4. **Upgrade Charges** – Those cheerful “mandatory updates” every year? They’re less about performance and more about perpetuating vendor revenue.
5. **Implementation Bloat** – Long go-live times mean you’re paying consultants, trainers, and coffee bills for months before you even see ROI.

# Personal Observation (Straight from the Field)

We once worked with a manufacturer in the UK who told us their ERP annual subscription was higher than their office rent. (Yes, you read that right.) Even worse, they were using barely 30% of the features. When we built them a [custom ERP tailored to their actual needs](https://kanhasoft.com/erp-software-development.html), they slashed costs by nearly 40% in the first year. The best part? Their CFO now jokes he’s started to *like* budget meetings again.

# How Custom ERP Development Saves You Money

Here’s the part you’ve been waiting for: the “how.”

# 1. No More Paying for Features You Don’t Need

Custom ERP is built around your exact workflows. If you don’t need a module for advanced supply chain forecasting in five languages—guess what—you don’t pay for it.

# 2. Flexible Licensing (a.k.a. Ownership)

With custom ERP, *you* own the system. No per-user hostage fees. Add staff? No problem. Scale up or down without your software vendor throwing you a surprise party (with a massive bill attached).

# 3. Faster ROI Through Streamlined Implementation

Because it’s tailored to your processes from the get-go, custom ERP implementations are often quicker. Translation: less downtime, lower consulting fees, and faster time-to-value.

# 4. Reduced Training Costs

If your ERP looks and feels like it belongs to your business (because it does), employees learn faster. Less time in training = less money burned on workshops nobody enjoys.

# 5. Integration Without the Price Tag

Custom ERP can be built to play nicely with your existing systems—CRM, accounting, warehouse scanners—without endless third-party connectors and “integration consultants” billing by the hour.

# Transition: But Wait—Isn’t Custom ERP Expensive to Build?

Good question, and one we hear often. Yes, there’s an upfront investment, but here’s the truth: over a 3–5 year period, most businesses spend significantly less on custom ERP than on off-the-shelf subscriptions. It’s the difference between renting a fancy apartment you’ll never own and building a house that actually fits your family (and doesn’t charge you more when you add a sofa).

# A Global Perspective (USA, UK, Israel, Switzerland, UAE)

Because we work across multiple regions, we’ve noticed how ERP pain points (and savings opportunities) differ slightly by market:

* **USA** – Businesses overspend on ERP licenses for teams with fluctuating seasonal staff. Custom ERP lets them scale licenses without blowing the budget.
* **UK** – Compliance-heavy industries get hit with “special modules” priced like luxury add-ons. Custom ERP bakes compliance in from the start.
* **Israel** – Fast-scaling startups pay for ERP features they’ll only need three years down the line. Custom ERP grows with them, on-demand.
* **Switzerland** – Precision industries can’t afford downtime from “global updates.” Custom ERP allows controlled upgrades, saving both time and money.
* **UAE** – Companies often juggle multiple currencies and regional compliance tools—custom ERP consolidates them, cutting out duplicate licensing fees.

# Humor Break: The Gym Membership Analogy

Think of traditional ERP pricing like a gym membership. You pay for unlimited access, but realistically, you’re only using the treadmill and maybe the dumbbells. Meanwhile, you’re footing the bill for the sauna, spin classes, and cryotherapy chamber you’ll never touch. Custom ERP is like building a home gym—you pay once, and everything inside is exactly what you’ll use. (And no pushy trainers upselling protein shakes.)

# The Long-Term Savings Picture

Still skeptical? Let’s put it in numbers:

* **Year 1:** Custom ERP may cost equal to or slightly more than your off-the-shelf ERP subscription.
* **Year 2–3:** Savings kick in as you avoid per-user fees, unnecessary modules, and overpriced upgrades.
* **Year 4–5:** Total cost of ownership (TCO) for custom ERP is often 30–50% lower than off-the-shelf.

And the kicker? You now *own* a system that adapts to your growth, rather than renting one that controls your budget.

# Conclusion

ERP should be a tool that fuels growth—not a line item that fuels headaches. High ERP costs aren’t just frustrating; they’re unnecessary. With [custom ERP development](https://kanhasoft.com/erp-software-development.html), businesses can cut waste, reduce dependency on overpriced vendors, and finally see technology align with their goals (and budgets).

At Kanhasoft, we believe in building systems that serve you—not the other way around. So if your current ERP feels like an overpriced gym membership, maybe it’s time to build the home gym. After all, saving money while improving performance—that’s the kind of math we can all get behind.

# FAQs

**Q1: Is custom ERP really cheaper than off-the-shelf ERP?**  
Yes, especially over 3–5 years. While off-the-shelf systems have recurring subscription and upgrade fees, custom ERP has a one-time build cost plus much lower maintenance.

**Q2: How fast can custom ERP be implemented?**  
Implementation varies, but for small to mid-sized businesses, we typically deliver core modules in 8–12 weeks. That’s often faster than big-brand ERPs.

**Q3: Can custom ERP integrate with our existing tools?**  
Absolutely. At Kanhasoft, we specialize in ERP integrations—whether it’s accounting, CRM, or warehouse management tools.

**Q4: What if our business grows or changes?**  
Custom ERP is designed to scale. You can add modules, features, or users without being penalized with extra license fees.

**Q5: Is custom ERP secure?**  
Yes. Security is built into the design. We follow best practices for data protection and compliance across USA, UK, Israel, Switzerland, and UAE markets.",1,1759218000.0,u_Physical-Truth-1832,0,1.0,False

Also this would drastically cut down on pollution, traffic congestion, car accidents and pedestrian fatalities from all the cars commuting each day.

While this would negatively affect downtown stores, hopefully the white collar employees could use all the gas money they save on commuting to instead go out more to restaurants and bars and other places more and to be able to spend more monry at local stores.

Also this would allow people from rural communities more access to good jobs if those people were allowed to work from home in their home communities and only had to do video calls a few times a week and/or only had to travel to ""the big city"" once a month.",1,1759217883.0,NoModCensorship,0,1.0,False

1nu6s9f,https://i.redd.it/07kgxji489sf1.png,A Memorial Destroyed For A Mistress’s Amusement,"# Chapter 1 - The Masterpiece and the Betrayal

I'm a decade older than Sebastian. The first time I laid eyes on him, he was a scrawny street rat, fighting mutts for whatever scraps he could find.

His stare, raw and wild, was pure wolf.

So, I scooped him up. Molded him from the ground up.

Ten years. That’s all it took for Sebastian to morph from a gutter rat into the city’s golden boy, its most sought-after CEO.

For the longest time, I genuinely believed Sebastian was my masterpiece.

Until that fateful day. A bratty little girl, smug as you please, stopped my ride.

She casually placed a hand on her swollen belly, hit play on a recorder, and asked, “Sebastian, who do you like more—me or that old hag?”

Then, a voice I knew way too well, dripping with disdain: “Just some aging woman. All these years, what I’ve loathed most is her condescending attitude.”

A smile played on my lips. Looks like Sebastian had conveniently forgotten his days of begging like a stray.

The next day, a gift-wrapped box arrived on his doorstep. Inside? A bloody, lifeless fetus.

His eyes blazed, pure inferno. A gun found its way to my forehead. He snarled each word like a curse, “Lilith.”

I took a slow sip of my coffee, cool as ice. “Seems Mr. Lawrence has a memory lapse regarding my… methods.”

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, his voice a low growl. “You think I won’t pull the trigger?”

He wasn’t that pathetic waif anymore. Those years clawing their way to the top had chiseled him into something sharp and dangerous.

I just gave him a little shake of my head, a faint smile still on my face. “If I were you, I wouldn’t waste breath on threats.”

Sebastian froze. Then, a whisper of sound from the floor-to-ceiling window behind him.

He spun around, his expression shattering.

There she was, dangling from the 72nd floor, hands bound, her white gown billowing like a tattered flag. A sheer drop to oblivion yawned beneath her.

“I’d be cautious if I were you,” I purred, the gun still a chilling pressure against my temple. “If your hand happens to slip and I’m gone, your little darling downstairs gets… well, pulverized. One life gone… only one now, though.”

The girl’s sobs were pathetic. “Sebastian, save me!”

His eyes, bloodshot and wild, finally flicked the safety catch. “Lilith, how dare you!”

My security detail moved in like shadows.

The air crackled with unspoken violence, a storm about to break.

But with a dismissive flick of my wrist, I waved them back. “Stand down.”

Then, without even looking, I drew a hidden dagger and plunged it deep into Sebastian’s gut.

He gasped, a guttural sound of pain, but the gun pressed harder against my skin.

“Enjoying yourself?” I murmured, my voice soft, intimate.

Sebastian’s face was a mask of pure ice. “Are you satisfied? Now let her go.”

# Chapter 2 - The Ghost of Eve

Amaya's different from you. She's just some innocent babe who knows zilch.

Sebastian's goons showed up faster than a speeding bullet and snatched Amaya.

Honestly, I never really meant to hurt her anyway.

Watching Sebastian coo sweet nothings to the girl cradled in his arms, like she was some delicate, priceless artifact, I just felt… meh. So over it.

He used to hold me like that too—right after our enemies ripped away our baby, leaving me barren forever.

That was a fully-baked baby girl, we'd named her Eve.

Sebastian went all out for Eve, dropping serious coin on a gold statue in her memory.

He told me, ""Lilith, our child will surely find peace in the afterlife.""

He wanted a never-ending parade of worshippers, all praying for Eve, stacking up blessings for her.

I asked him once, ""Why all the drama?""

Sebastian, looking like a homeless lumberjack but with pure grit in his eyes, said:

""Because Eve is the only kid I'm ever gonna get in this lifetime.""

Now, I'm staring at the gift box on Sebastian's desk.

Sebastian, you reneged on your word. But no sweat—I'll jog your memory.

When the girl finally stopped her waterworks, she glared at me, eyes puffy and radiating pure hate:

""Sebastian, it's her! That witch killed our baby!""

But Sebastian's face went dark.

He ran a hand through her hair, his voice eerily chill, ""You've gone too far.""

Amaya's sobs choked in her throat.

She had no clue that ever since we lost Eve, no one around us dared breathe a word about anything related to kids.

That pain? It's a ghost that'll forever haunt Sebastian and me.

Nobody spilled the tea to Amaya. She just kept wailing, her cries enough to shatter anyone's soul.

Sebastian scooped up her limp body, bulldozed past me, and stomped out.

**TLDR**: i am gonna get a full bottle of FOLLOWED by KEROSENE + story of looking for my signature scent!



**my fragrance journey + how i found this sub and made my first fragrance purchase this week below!**

hi! i have never bought a fragrance with intent before until recently. my favorite scents have always been peppermint and coffee (not together). so when i found this reddit and the fragantica site i was shocked to see such a community. this is my first post here!

i never understood perfume-obsessed people as i thought it was insane bc perfumes range from $100-$500 in the normal market. i really thought that BBW body sprays/mists were like the max i would spend on a body fragrance. i especially thought this because i never experienced any high end perfume that lasts nor projects. so i always wondered what the point was in spending so much $$$ on a lil ahh bottle!

this year i have been venturing to find a fragrance that i can call my signature scent. my whole life i have just emptied bottles not wanting to rebuy any of them (they were gifts). i began this last january when i remembered i absolutely loved the scent of a BBW hand soap called 'pistachio cream puff.' i loved that soap so much even thought i only ever had 1 bottle. i still mourn it being discontinued bc i would drink it if i could. it was the perfect nutty scent. so naturally, i found a pistachio based parfum and ordered Lattafa Pride 'Affection' EDP. unfortunately it was neither lasting nor a match to that BBW pistachio scent i was yearning for.

then in july i figured i should go toward my fav scent: peppermint. its a scent i use in every other department: shampoo, cleaning, home fragrance, gum, car fragrance, and of course toothpaste. i searched by notes of mint on fragantica and stumbled upon a fragrance called L'Bel - Bleu Glacial. i thought it was a score bc it was on amazon and only around $26! i thought i scored bc people also said it lasted, which was all i needed if i was going to buy and find and stick with a fragrance to call my own. unfortunately, once it arrived, i quickly learned it was more on the icy stereotypical 'mens' side of smells. less minty, and more icy, like axe or aftershave. i was sad. but i have it in the bathroom and i am doing my best to empty it as a room spray/shower curtain spray. sometimes even before a shower to enhance the mint.

next, i figured the mint search was a bust, so let me go to my 2nd fav scent in the world: coffee. funny, bc i dont even drink it! so again i used fragantica and found Al-Rehab French Coffee EDP. i REALLY thought i hit the jackpot bc people described it as the stereotypical coffee grounds smell AND it was available on amazon for ONLY $6. well that sucks because i ordered it at the start of september and it hasnt even shipped. and i am picky on amazon to the point where i only order if it has the guarantee prime delivery under 1 week. this one did. but yet, still no shipping notif. the amazon chat only lets me click track shipment which keeps insisting that it is estimated to arrive oct 25th. it wont let me type or give me a chat with associate option. so im just like whatever its only $6 so i will leave it and ask for the refund at the end of october since thats what the chat bot said.

THEN, i find this reddit. and wow. immediately stumble upon a lil guy called FOLLOWED by KEROSENE. and well it is safe to say that i spent hours at 3 am literally LOLing in my bed and rolling around in TEARS over the testimonials people have given it on this reddit and on reviews on fragrance seller sites. i immediately feel FOMO but also happiness that there is a scent out there that is SO pungent, it lasts for days. THATS what i need. and its coffee based? SOLD.

so i go to ministry of scent as fragrantica says that is one place it is sold and they have a deal where if you buy a full bottle, you get 3 samples. in the same 3am escapade that i learn of its existance, i chicken out of getting a full bottle of FOLLOWED, and i decide to make it one of my samples. people's horror stories got to me and i thought if i like the sample, then i will let myself get it. so i quickly search for what i could buy as my full bottle and look for something non-offensive. so i go on my MINT search again. i find a lil bottle called SAINT JULEP by IMAGINARY AUTHORS. it sounds lovely and has the mint i like! so i get that in a full bottle with 3 samples of KEROSENE's FOLLOWED, PROMISES PROMISES, and DS & Durga's Pistachio.

so the package comes as i pee my pants in excitement. i am expecting to be hit with FOLLOWED like all the testimonials mentioned how it fumigated their streets and mailboxes, but i couldnt smell it. weird. so i keep opening as it is the first high end perfume i have bought. felt like i popped my fragrant cherry. i loved SAINT JULEP. it honestly has the mint that i was looking for all my life but does it in a summery/citrusy way. im not mad at it! but unfortunately, it lasts but only an hour or two. the exact sentiment that drove me away from purchasing high end fragrances. but, hey it is fun to spray and i was kicking my feet on the first spray as the fine mist immediately let me know how fancy this world of fragrance was. i was used to BBW FFM's sputtering raindrops. this SAINT JULEP bottle was like the water mister at an amusement park, gently caressing me. ok so anyway......

i get to the samples, i'll only talk about FOLLOWED as that is the topic of this post (yes, there is a point to this post believe it or not). i LOVE it and immediately im giggling, blushing, kicking my feet bc there it is!!! THERE is that smack of dunkin coffee air hitting me when i sprayed this sample. THIS. this is what i have yearned for all my life in a bottle! and better yet, i never got the maple syrup/pancake dry down EVERYONE talked about. it stayed nutty to my nose which i LOVED. i sprayed one spray on my couch and bed pillow out of fear but i did not get the nuclear sillage everyone raved about. so, and brace yourself, i used nearly the entire sample on my bed and my couch. NOW DAYS LATER I AM LOVING THIS NUTTY NUTMEG SWEET HAZELNUT COFFEE SMELL I HAVE IN MY HOME. it is def wearing off, BUT STILL THATS LONG ENOUGH FOR ME! so now, i know that i need this in a full bottle.

i cant believe it is $165 brand new 😭 but i NEED it. then i remembered that people hate this fragrance so much that many often get rid of it. oh how i wish i could find a thrown away bottle 😂 (half kidding). anyway, im so glad i didnt like ramble or anything!

i am new to this community and so i cant wait to discover minty/coffee finds!

thank u for coming to my 2am ted talk of my fingers cramping typing this up in my nutty, coffee scented bed!",1,1759216996.0,fragrance,13,0.54,False

Aria  
  
It's so beautiful! I spin around in the middle of the suite Ethan booked for us. The luxurious carpet, velvet curtains, sparkling chandeliers-is something straight out of a magazine.  
  
The annual New Year cruise ship tour hosted by my school, Crescent Wolves Academy, is everything I've ever dreamed of but never thought I'd experience.  
  
Me, Aria Whitlock, standing here on a fr\*\*king cruise ship?  No way. I'm an eighteen-year-old, lowly omega scraping by in a world that couldn't care less about me.   
  
But tonight? Tonight, I'm not a nobody.  
  
Nope. Tonight, I'm Alpha Ethan's mate. My Ethan, the future Alpha of the Full Moon Pack, my personal knight in shining armor.  
  
The Moon Goddess must've finally stopped ignoring me.  
  
""Aria, move your a\*s! We're going to miss the welcome party at this point."" Mia's voice yanks me out of my thoughts.   
  
She barges in, her wild auburn curls bouncing, looking like a fiery storm in her emerald-green dress.   
  
Right behind her is Lily, the complete opposite with her soft, blonde hair and shy smile, rocking a simple blue gown.  
  
They're my best friends... the only ones in the entire pack who treat me like a person instead of c\*\*p.  
  
""Wow,"" Lily's blue eyes widen as she takes in the suite. ""You and Alpha Ethan's room is so much prettier than ours.""  
  
""That's because Ethan wanted me to experience the absolute best,"" I squeal, practically bouncing on my toes.  
  
Mia gags dramatically. ""Ugh, you sound like you're in some cringy rom-com. Stop it before I puke.""  
  
""S\*\*t up, Mia,"" I shoot back, grinning.  
  
She flops onto the bed like she owns the place.   
  
""Look, I'm just saying, Alpha Ethan better step up tonight. You've been waiting forever for him to stop hiding your a\*s. If he pulls some crap, I'm kicking his Alpha-wannabe face.""  
  
""Mia!"" Lily gasps, looking scandalized. ""Be nice! This is a big night for Aria.""  
  
""I am being nice,"" Mia shrugs. ""Just stating facts. Alpha Ethan's been dragging his feet for months. And I don't know how far I can trust him.""  
  
""Stop,"" I sigh, trying to keep my voice steady. ""He promised me, okay? He said tonight, he's telling everyone. It's finally happening.""  
  
Mia raises an eyebrow, like she wants to argue, but Lily grabs her arm. ""Leave it, Mia. Let Aria enjoy her night.""  
  
Mia rolls her eyes but holds her tongue. I turn back to the mirror, fluffing my long black hair and adjusting my floral dress. It's not anything fancy-just the nicest thing I own.   
  
Ethan knows I don't care about flashy clothes, and besides, he's already paid for me and my friends to come on this cruise. That's more than enough.  
  
\----  
  
The party hall is like something straight out of a movie. Christmas lights sparkle from every angle. The air smells like cinnamon pine trees. And everyone's dressed to k\*\*l.  
  
And I mean everyone. These are the elite kids from all the top werewolf academies. Future Alphas and Betas, their perfectly dressed selves, and their annoyingly perfect lives.  
  
Me, Mia, and Lily? We don't belong here.   
  
""Maybe we should've stayed in the suite,"" Lily murmurs, her wide eyes darting around the room.  
  
""Nope,"" Mia says firmly. ""We're here, so we're owning it. Stand tall, ladies. Don't let these stuck-up as\*\*oles make you feel small.""  
  
Lily nods hesitantly. And I try to do the same. But the whispers, stares, and judgmental glares... it's all f\*\*king too much.  
  
""I'm gonna find Ethan now,"" I throw quickly. ""You guys grab some drinks. I'll catch up with you later.""  
  
""Good luck,"" Lily says, her soft smile making me feel a little braver.  
  
""You got this, future Luna,"" Mia adds with a smirk, but I can tell she means it.  
  
Future Luna. The words make my heart flip.  
  
I wander through the party, scanning the crowd for Ethan. My wolf stirs nervously, the back of my mind itching like something's off.   
  
I try to shake it off. Ethan's here somewhere, probably waiting for me.  
  
A few minutes later, I spot his hockey teammates relaxing in a corner and laughing about something... Relief floods me as I approach.  
  
""Hey, guys. Have you seen Ethan?"" I manage an awkward smile.  
  
The laughter stops. The way they look at me... Like I'm some crap under their shoes. It makes my skin crawl.  
  
""Why don't you check over there?"" One of them nods towards a dark corner of the hall.  
  
The others snicker. All except one.  
  
Alpha Lucas of the Shadow Pang pack.  
  
He's leaning against the wall, arms crossed. His intense gray eyes fixed on me with an unreadable expression.   
  
Lucas Russo, captain of the hockey team. Notorious playboy, and Ethan's arch enemy. He doesn't laugh or smile... just looks at me like he knows something I don't.  
  
My wolf, Gail, shifts uncomfortably under his gaze. But I ignore her. ""Thanks,"" I force a smile, turning toward the corner.  
  
I make my way through the crowd, my stomach suddenly twisting in knots.  
  
And then I see him.  
  
Ethan.  
  
My Ethan... his hands are on Vanessa, the Academy's head cheerleader, most popular girl in school, and my personal nightmare.   
  
He ki\*\*es her like she's the air he needs to breathe.  
  
My heart shatters.  
  
  
Chapter 2 Mate  
Aria  
  
My stomach drops. The same hands that held me last night, the same lips that whispered I love you and ki\*\*ed me like I was his world are now all over Vanessa's face.  
  
""Ethan, how could you,"" I choke out, my ch\*\*t splitting open with a pain so sharp it steals my breath.  
  
He freezes, pulling back just enough to meet my gaze. For a split second, I catch a flicker of guilt in his eyes. Then, he smirks.  
  
Smirks!  
  
""Aria,"" he says nonchalantly, like he wasn't just caught red-handed. ""What are you doing here? Go away.""  
  
My wolf growls low in my mind, her anger and heartbreak twisting with mine. He lied, she snarls. He lied to us.  
  
Vanessa, of course, looks smug as h\*\*l. She leans into him, her perfectly manicured nails trailing down his ch\*\*t like she's marking her territory.  
  
""Oh, sweetheart,"" she purrs with a fake smile. ""You didn't really think he'd pick you, did you?""  
  
Ethan laughs cruelly, and his smirk stretches wider.  
  
""You're such a godd\*\*n joke,"" he begins, like I'm the punchline to some twisted, cruel comedy.   
  
""Did you really think you were anything more than a silly f\*\*k? A poor, desperate little omega playing my girlfriend? Luna? You? Get real, Aria. You're a nobody. Always will be.""  
  
His words slam into me like a freight train. I blink, my throat dry, my ears ringing.  
  
""You promised, Ethan. You said-""  
  
""Yeah, and you believed me?"" he cuts me off with a sharp, biting laugh. It's loud, cold, and heartless. ""God, Aria, you're even more pathetic than I thought.""  
  
Vanessa giggles, her bright red lips curving into a satisfied smirk as she clings to his arm like a trophy.   
  
Ethan glances down at her, his expression softening in a way it never has for me.  
  
""Why the h\*\*l would I pick you to stand beside me?"" he continues in disgust.   
  
""A weak, pudgy little nobody? I need a Luna who's strong, beautiful like Nessa. Not some mid-tier omega with a sob story.""  
  
I swear, the air leaves the room. My hands start shaking, and I can barely see straight.   
  
""You don't mean that,"" I whisper, tears blurring my vision. ""So... last night... it didn't mean anything to you?""  
  
""Oh, you mean the f\*\*king?"" He smirks, and Vanessa throws her head back, laughing like I just told the funniest joke in the world.  
  
""It was all a bet. I wanted to prove to my friends how easy you are ...a cheap wh\*\*e. And guess what? You didn't disappoint.""  
  
Vanessa steps forward, her red dress clinging to her like some cheap second skin. ""Hear that, ugly duckling? It was all a game. A pathetic, hilarious game.""  
  
People were staring now...whispering. Laughing. Every single one of their gazes feels like a kn\*\*e to my ch\*\*t.  
  
""No,"" I manage, shaking my head so hard my hair whip around my face. ""No, Ethan, you're lying. You're my mate!""  
  
""Not anymore."" He crosses his arms. ""I, Alpha Ethan Stevens of the Full Moon Pack, reject you, Aria Whitlock, as my mate and future Luna.""  
  
My knees almost give out, and my wolf lets out this sorrowful howl in my head that made me wince.   
  
""No,"" I choke out, over and over, my hands clutching my ch\*\*t trying to hold my shattered heart together.  
  
Ethan rolls his eyes. ""Accept the rejection, Aria. Or, I swear, when we get back to the pack, I'll have you banished. I don't need you. I don't want you. H\*\*l, the s\*x wasn't even good.""  
  
His words stab my heart like a kn\*\*e. I can't breathe, can't think, can't do any f\*\*king thing except stand there, crashing out.  
  
But I can't afford to be Banished.   
  
""I..."" My voice is barely a whisper. ""I, Aria Whitlock, accept the rejection.""  
  
The moment the words leave my mouth, pain explodes in my ch\*\*t. My wolf howls louder, her painful cries echoing in my head as the bond snaps.   
  
It's like my soul's been ripped in shreds.  
  
""Good,"" Ethan sneers. ""Now, get your pathetic si\*\*y a\*s out of my sight. Oh, and don't forget to clear your s\*\*t out of my suite.""  
  
I look at him, pleading. ""Where am I supposed to stay? The ship has a two-person room limit-""  
  
""Not my problem,"" he cuts me off rudely. ""H\*\*l, jump overboard for all I care.""  
  
His words burn. They scorch. And before I can register, my legs carry me out of the party room, past the laughing crowd, and up the ship's deck.  
  
I don't know how long I sat there, sobbing into the night. The stars above feel like they're mocking me, shining so brightly while my life has completely shattered.   
  
Ethan, my mate...my f\*\*king mate has destroyed me. How could the Moon Goddess be so cruel? I gave him everything.   
  
My heart. My trust. My vi\*\*inity. And for what? To be humiliated and tossed aside like tr\*\*h?  
  
Before I know it, I'm climbing onto the railing. The wind blows my hair around my face, and the ocean below looks so calm, so inviting.  
  
Maybe that ba\*\*ard is right. Maybe I don't belong anywhere.  
  
I'm so ashamed, too brokenhearted. There is nothing left for me in this st\*\*id world. I know the bullying will only get worse, the gossip louder, the stares sharper.  
  
I'll be ostracized even more, torn apart by the same people who've always hated me.  
  
And my friends... I can't bear the thought of them suffering because of me. They've stood by me through thick and thin, but this? This shame? It'll drag them down too.  
  
It's not worth it. Not at all.  
  
I close my eyes, ready to jump, when a voice carries through the night.  
  
""Don't do it. Don't jump.""  
  
I freeze, my heart thumping. Slowly, I turn to see Alpha Lucas leaning against the railing, a ci\*\*rette dangling between his fingers.   
  
His al\*\*ring gray eyes glint under the moonlight, and for a second, I don't even know how to breathe.  
  
""Why do you care?"" I snap, tears still streaming down my face. ""You've never even acknowledged my existence. Just go away.""  
  
""You're right,"" he sighs, taking a slow drag from his ci\*\*rette. ""But are you really gonna jump, because some as\*\*ole decided to be an even bigger as\*\*ole.""  
  
""You don't understand,"" I yell back. ""My life is f\*\*king ruined!""  
  
He raises his eyebrow, blowing out a puff of sm\*\*e. ""Alright, jump then.""  
  
I blink at him, confused. ""What?""  
  
""You heard me."" He shrugs, leaning casually against the railing. ""If you're so sure it's over, then jump. Go ahead.""  
  
I let out a frustrated sob, turning back to the water. But I can't do this. My hands are shaking, and my legs stay frozen in place.  
  
""What's the problem?"" Lucas taunts. ""Chicken?""  
  
I whip around, ready to yell at him to f\*\*k off, but the movement made me lose my balance.   
  
My foot slips, and before I can scream, Lucas lunges forward, grabbing me and pulling me back. My breath catches as I look up at him, his face inches from mine.  
  
I land against his ch\*\*t, his strong arms wrapping around me effortlessly.   
  
Suddenly, fireworks explode in the sky above us, painting his sharp, chiseled features in flashes of red and gold. My heart skips a beat, and I'm unable to tear my gaze away from him.  
  
My wolf stirr, and then it hit me-hard.  
  
Mate.  
  
  
Chapter 3 Fake Girlfriend  
Aria  
  
""What the actual h\*\*l?"" I yank myself out of his hold, shaking my head like he's lost his d\*\*n mind. ""You're lying. I don't even feel a bond or smell your scent.""  
  
A lie. A huge lie. He smells like heaven dipped in sin, and being this close to him makes my wolf stir like she's been on a three-shot espresso bender.  
  
But no way. Nope. Not happening. He can't be my mate.  
  
""Why..."" My voice rises with each word.   
  
""Why the h\*\*l would the Moon Goddess saddle me with someone like you as my second-chance mate?"" I throw my hands in the air, completely done with this cosmic joke.  
  
Lucas looks amused, which only pisses me off more. Of course, he's amused.  
  
The guy's the king of our school, the golden boy every girl worships, and oh yeah, a f\*\*king young billionaire.   
  
Me? I'm just Aria Whitlock, professional doormat. We're not even the same species as far as the social ladder is concerned.  
  
""No, seriously,"" I add, throwing him a dirty look. ""Why would the Goddess waste a perfectly good mate bond on you?""  
  
""Woah,"" he says, clutching his ch\*\*t like I've wounded him. ""Harsh, much?""  
  
""You're a literal manwhore, Lucas. You've sl\*\*t with half the school. Probably the other half, too, if skirts aren't your thing.""  
  
He shrugs, not even trying to deny it. ""Okay, fair.""  
  
I narrow my eyes. ""I'm not doing this. I can't go from one as\*\*ole mate to another. I'm not accepting this bond.""  
  
""That's cool."" He leans casually against the railing, looking like rejection doesn't faze him. ""Because same.""  
  
""Wait-what?"" I blink, caught off guard.  
  
""But,"" he continues, that trademark cocky smirk spreading across his stupidly perfect face, ""I want to be your fake boyfriend.""  
  
I stare at him like he's sprouted another head. ""What the h\*\*l are you talking about?""  
  
""Let's fake-date for the rest of this cruise,"" he says, like it's the most normal thing in the world.  
  
""You know, to piss off Ethan and Vanessa. And don't worry, I'm not interested in the mate bond either.""  
  
I gape at him, trying to figure out if he's serious. He is. Of course he is. Lucas Russo lives for drama.   
  
I frown, trying to wrap my head around this mess. I know Lucas and Ethan don't exactly get along h\*\*l, they can't stand each other.   
  
But Lucas's casual dismissal of the mate bond... It stings, but why does it bug me so much? I mean, my own mate doesn't even care about it, so why the h\*\*l should I?  
  
But d\*\*n it, the idea of rubbing this in Ethan's face is kind of te\*\*ting. Still...   
  
""No way,"" I say flatly. ""Not interested.""  
  
Lucas tilts his head. ""Oh yeah? Where're you planning to stay? Ethan's suite? Oh, wait-he kicked your a\*s out. And isn't there a two-person limit per room?""  
  
S\*\*t. My face falls as I realize he's right. St\*\*id ship rules.  
  
""I'll stay with my friends,"" I snap, grasping at straws.  
  
He smirks. ""Last I checked, there were three of you. You really think your friends gonna pick who gets the boot?""  
  
D\*\*n it. He's got me there.  
  
""Why are you even doing this?"" I ask, crossing my arms.  
  
Lucas's smirk softens, just a little. ""Because I can't stand that di\*\*head, and I hate the way he treated you. I saw everything.""  
  
Shame burns my cheeks, but it's quickly drowned out by anger.   
  
Sc\*\*w Ethan. Sc\*\*w Vanessa. And sc\*\*w this entire situation. Maybe Lucas's ridiculous plan isn't the worst idea ever.  
  
I sigh. ""So, what's the catch?""  
  
He gives me a sideways smirk. ""Pretty much everything.  
  
""Fine,"" I mutter. ""I'll do it. But it's fake. Strictly fake.""  
  
Lucas grins, victorious. ""Obviously. We'll play the happy couple, make sure everyone knows we're mates, and after the cruise we'll reject each other.""  
  
""Deal,"" I say.   
  
""But one more thing-don't fall in love with me.""  
  
I bark out a st\*\*id laugh. ""Right back atcha. Don't get any ideas. Seriously. You're not my type, and I'm not gonna fall for you.""  
  
I try not to let my eyes travel to his gray eyes, that perfectly chiseled face, olive skin, and those muscles.  
  
Not that I'd ever let it happen. Not in a million years.  
  
""You're not my type either.""  
  
I scowl. ""Don't worry. I've had enough players to last a lifetime.""  
  
Lucas sticks out his hand, smirking. ""Partners?""  
  
I roll my eyes but shake his hand. ""Partners.""  
  
""So, how exactly do we end it... you know, when it's all over?"" I ask Lucas, trying to sound casual, even though the question has been rattling around in my head.  
  
His face grows serious for a moment, which is honestly more unsettling than his usual smirk.  
  
""The very last day on this ship? We reject each other and get the h\*\*l out of here,"" he says, like he's delivering the weather forecast.  
  
I nod slowly. That actually sounds like the best option. There's nothing for me here, anyway.   
  
I mean, Lucas? A total playboy. The guy couldn't commit to any girl. He only cares for hockey.   
  
""Once we're off this ship, whatever happens here stays here,"" he adds, giving me a pointed look.  
  
I nod again, because what else am I supposed to do? He'll probably waltz back to his perfect life-where women throw themselves at him-and I'll shuffle back to my gloomy little existence.   
  
You know, like Cinderella, except without the fancy ball, the prince, or even a decent pair of shoes.  
  
""Great. Now come on, girlfriend, let's go get your stuff from that as\*\*ole,"" Lucas says, all casual, like we're heading to grab coffee-not stepping into the lion's den.  
  
  
Chapter 4 You're Lying  
Aria  
  
I give him a side-eye. ""Girlfriend? You're laying it on thick already, huh?""  
  
He smirks, not even missing a beat. ""Oh, you'll see. PDA's part of the plan. Gotta make that loser jealous, and trust me, it'll work.""  
  
I almost trip over my own feet. Me, in some fake relationship with Lucas-the-Resident-Player? Yeah, that'd go over great.  
  
The judgment I'd get from my friends? Yikes. I can practically hear them already: Aria, really? Lucas?   
  
But honestly? It's worth it to see Ethan's st\*\*id, smug face crumble.  
  
When we finally reach Ethan's door, Lucas leans against the frame like this is just another Tuesday for him.   
  
""Need help packing, babe?"" he asks, that annoying little grin plastered on his face.  
  
""Nope. I don't even have much,"" I say, bracing myself as I open the door.  
  
And bam, there it is. That stench I used to like...Ethan's scent or whatever-hits me like a truck. But now? Now it makes me wanna gag. I don't even bother looking for him.   
  
Dude's probably in the bathroom, preening like a peacock. I start shoving my stuff into my bag, laser-focused on getting out of there.  
  
And then I hear it.  
  
W\*t, sl\*\*py sounds.  
  
I freeze as the bathroom door creaks open. And there they are...Ethan and Vanessa, mid-ma\*\*out...   
  
Honestly, I've never felt more disgusted in my life.   
  
""Oh, look who it is,"" Ethan sneers, his arm still wrapped around Vanessa like she's some kind of property. ""If you hadn't come, I'd have tossed your c\*\*p into the tr\*\*h.""  
  
Classy, right?  
  
I don't say anything. I just grab my bag and head for the door, but of course, Mr. Ego won't let me go without one last dig.  
  
""Are you ignoring me, Aria?"" he snaps. ""Have you forgotten I'm your alpha? Stop right there!""  
  
I stop, but I refuse to look at him. I'm done playing his st\*\*id games.  
  
""So, where are you gonna stay, huh? You don't even have a room,"" he jeers, and Vanessa snickers like the knockoff Barbie she is. ""They'll probably throw you overboard soon.""  
  
I spin around, my eyes blazing. ""Better than staying here and looking at your pathetic loser face.""  
  
You should see him. His jaw set so hard. ""What did you just say?"" he growls, stepping closer. ""You're seriously gonna in\*\*lt your alpha?""  
  
Oh, he's f\*\*king pissed, alright. But I didn't flinch. Not anymore. He shoves me, barking something about lowering my eyes, but before I can even respond, the door slams open.  
  
Lucas walks in.  
  
""Yo, what the h\*\*l are you doing?"" Lucas's voice is ice-cold, but his smirk is all fire.  
  
Ethan looks like he's seen a ghost. ""What the f\*\*k are you doing here?""  
  
Lucas slings an arm around my shoulder like he's been doing it for years. ""I'm here to get my girlfriend. Problem?""  
  
Ethan blinks like he's been sl\*\*ped. ""Girlfriend?!""  
  
""Yup,"" Lucas says, popping the p like he's chewing gum. ""Aria's my girlfriend now. Crazy how things work out, huh?""  
  
Ethan's face? Priceless. Vanessa's jaw is almost on the floor.  
  
""That's absurd,"" she sputters, like the idea of me being with someone hot is a crime against nature.  
  
Lucas casually slides his arm around my waist, pulling me closer. ""Yeah. My mate, actually. Got a problem with that?""  
  
Ethan laughs, his face twitching like he's fighting the urge to punch someone-Lucas probably. ""This is bullshit. You're just doing this to piss me off.""  
  
""And?""Lucas tilts his head, all smug confidence. ""Is it working?""  
  
Ethan's eyes narrow, but he steps back. ""You can have her. She's tr\*\*h anyway.""  
  
My ch\*\*t tightens, but before I can spiral, Lucas leans down and whispers, just loud enough for them to hear, ""Bet she's the best tr\*\*h you've ever seen, huh?""   
  
He winks at Ethan, grabs my bag, and steers me toward the door.  
  
As we leave, I glance back. Vanessa looks ready to burst into flames, and Ethan? His fake indifference is cracking at the edges.   
  
I can't help but smirk. Seeing their faces twist like they've su\*\*ed on bitter lemons? Chef's k\*\*s.  
  
We walk until we're halfway down the hall. Lucas starts laughing under his breath, and, against all odds, I find myself laughing too.  
  
""That was fun,"" he says, grinning at me. ""Did you see their faces?""  
  
""Oh, I saw,"" I admit, still laughing a little despite myself. ""But this is insane.""  
  
""Insane is my specialty,"" he shoots back. ""Now, come on, girlfriend. Let's get you to my suite.""  
  
And that's when it hits me. I'm about to spend the night in Lucas's suite. Alone. With Lucas. The guy who has a reputation as the school's biggest wh\*\*e.  
  
Oh, f\*\*k my life.  
  
  
Chapter 5 Stop Calling Me Girlfriend  
Aria  
  
My heart's pounding like a bass drum in a bad EDM track as Lucas and I walk toward his suite. Gail, my wolf, is practically doing cartwheels in my head, and I can't help but gr\*\*n internally. Seriously, Gail? Haven't we learned our lesson about ""mates""?  
  
'It's the Moon Goddess, not me,'Gail snarks, clearly unimpressed with my attitude.  
  
'Yeah, well, the Moon Goddess needs better matchmaking skills,' I shoot back, effectively earning myself an eye roll from my own f\*\*king wolf. Great.  
  
We don't even make it halfway to Lucas's suite before a guy in a hockey jersey...a teammate of Lucas's, I think-comes strolling up. His black hair is a mess, and he's got that ""just got off the rink"" look.  
  
""Alpha Lucas, where the have you been? Coach is losing his mind,"" the guy says, but his eyes immediately land on me. And then on the bag Lucas is holding. The confusion on his face is priceless.  
  
""Oh, come on, Damon,"" Lucas groans, rolling his eyes. ""Why didn't you just tell him I was sl\*\*ping or something?""  
  
The guy, Damon, looks unimpressed. ""Dude, you know Beta John is stubborn as h\*\*l. He said it's important. Message from the Alpha.""  
  
Lucas's entire vibe changes. His eyes narrow, jaw clenching. ""My dad?"" he mutters, not sounding thrilled.  
  
Now, I don't know much about Lucas's family, but I've heard enough whispers to know his dad is the Alpha of the Shadow Fang Pack, billionaire extraordinaire, and the owner of Crescent Wolf Academy. Basically, he's a big deal.  
  
Lucas hands me my bag. ""Here, I'll go check on this. I'll come back and get you, or do you want me to walk you to the suite?""  
  
I shake my head quickly. ""I'll wait. Go handle your stuff. I need to check on my friends anyway.""  
  
He nods, but Damon gives me one last confused look before they both disappear down the hall. The second they're out of sight, I let out a breath I didn't realize I was holding. Saved... for now.  
  
Dragging my bag behind me, I head to Mia and Lily's suite. They're probably fr\*\*king out since I've been ghosting the mind-link all day.  
  
The second I knock, the door flies open, and Mia yanks me inside like I'm the last slice of pizza at a party.  
  
""Where the h\*\*l have you been, Aria?!"" she snaps, her hazel eyes blazing.  
  
""We were so worried!"" Lily chimes in, her normally calm face scrunched up in anger.  
  
""I'm sorry, okay? I just..."" I flop onto the bed, trying to come up with something that doesn't sound pathetic.  
  
""You don't have to explain,"" Mia cuts in gently. ""The gossip's everywhere. Alpha Ethan is a complete piece of s\*\*t.""  
  
I bite my lip, tears pricking my eyes. ""You were right, Mia. He cheated on me. Publicly. And he laughed about it.""  
  
Before I know it, both of them are hugging me, their warmth making the ache in my ch\*\*t feel a little less suffocating.  
  
""I'm gonna k\*\*l him,"" Mia growls, pulling back. Her eyes flash yellow, and I know Ren, her wolf, is clawing to come out.  
  
""Calm down, Mia,"" I say quickly. ""I'm fine.""  
  
""You're not fine,"" she snaps, but there are tears in her eyes now. ""You deserve better.""  
  
I try to reassure her, but the sadness in her voice nearly breaks me. Mia's always been the tough one, so seeing her like this made me realize how much she cares for me.   
  
""I'm okay, Mia. Really.""  
  
""No, you're not,"" she snaps, wiping her tears but still looking ready to throw Ethan into the ocean.  
  
""Guys, let's forget about him. I don't even care anymore. I hate him,"" I say, trying to sound confident.  
  
""That's the spirit!"" Lily cheers, wiping her own tears.  
  
But then Mia narrows her eyes at me suspiciously. ""You're taking this breakup a little too well. Spill.""  
  
I hesitate. ""Okay, fine. Something happened.""  
  
""What do you mean? Spill!"" Lily leans forward, practically bouncing with curiosity.  
  
I fiddle with the hem of my dress, suddenly wishing I could shrink into the floor. My voice wavers as I finally admit, ""I went to the deck... to jump into the water.""  
  
The looks on their faces...shock, hurt, and a touch of horror, make my ch\*\*t ache.  
  
""You what?"" Mia's voice cracks as she grabs my arm like I'm about to bolt.  
  
""I-"" I stutter, ""I didn't mean to scare you guys. I wasn't trying to hurt anyone. I just... I just wanted it all to stop. My life... my pathetic excuse for a life.""  
  
""Aria,"" Lily breathes out, already in tears, before she and Mia tackle me into a tight hug.  
  
""Don't you ever do that again,"" Mia growls.   
  
I feel their warmth around me, and for a moment, the crushing weight on my ch\*\*t lightens. But when they pull back, the disappointment in their eyes stabs me straight through.  
  
""I'm sorry,"" I whisper. ""I wasn't thinking about how it'd affect you two. I was just... done.""  
  
""Oh, Aria,"" Mia cries.  
  
They both hug me tightly again. Next I told them about Lucas, the fake dating plan, the whole insane mess.  
  
The second I mention Lucas, their jaws drop. By the time I was done explaining the fake dating plan, Lily looks like she's about to faint, and Mia is pacing the room like a caged animal.  
  
""Lucas? As in Alpha Lucas? The hockey god? The billionaire? The playboy?"" Mia's voice gets higher with every word.  
  
""Yes,"" I mumble.  
  
""The Moon Goddess must really hate you,"" Mia mutters, throwing her hands up. ""First Ethan, now him?"" Mia deadpans.  
  
""I think it's romantic,"" Lily's eyes sparkled. ""Imagine taming the untamable Alpha.""  
  
I glare at her. ""This isn't a rom-com, Lily. And it's not real. It's just... revenge.""  
  
""And he wants to fake-date you to piss off Ethan whom he hates?"" Lily raises her voice slightlyl.  
  
I nod.   
  
""And you agreed?!""  
  
""I was angry, okay? Ethan deserved it. And you should've seen his face when he saw us together. It was chef's k\*\*s,"" I admit, smirking.  
  
""Well, he deserves it,"" Mia huffs. ""But, girl, Lucas is your mate. Billionaire, Alpha, hot as h\*\*l... also a massive player. This is a disaster waiting to happen.""  
  
Lily gasps. ""And his fangirls! They're gonna mu\*\*er you.""  
  
""Oh, please. He's not even a celebrity,"" I scoff.  
  
Mia and Lily exchange a look before screaming, ""IT DOESN'T MATTER!""  
  
I roll my eyes. ""Look, it's just until the tour ends. Then we reject each other and go our separate ways.""  
  
""And then what? Go back to the pack and get bullied all over again?"" Mia asks softly, her anger fading into sadness.  
  
""I don't have a choice. Lucas doesn't want the mate bond or anything serious. Besides, I need a room-"" Before I can complete my words, there's a knock at the door. Mia opens it, and I swear the temperature in the room skyrockets. Lucas is standing there, leaning casually against the doorframe, looking like he walked out of a high fashion ad.  
  
Mia and Lily look like they've just seen a Marvel superhero walk into the room. Mia's mouth is hanging open, and Lily's blinking like her brain has short-circuited.  
  
Lucas notices and smirks. ""Nice to meet you, ladies.""   
  
Mia's face turns red, and Lily looks like she's about to swoon. I'm officially mortified.  
  
He takes my bag and grabs my hand. ""Come on, girlfriend. Let's go.""  
  
Mia and Lily are still staring as he pulls me out of the room.  
  
""Can you stop calling me 'girlfriend' I hiss once we're out in the hallway.  
  
""What? It suits you,"" he says with a wink, completely unbothered.  
  
I glare at him, but he just laughs.  
  
As we walk down the hall, my heart starts pounding again. I'm about to spend the night in a room with Lucas fr\*\*king Russo. Alone.  
  
He looks at me, and there's something in his eyes that makes my stomach flip. ""You'll love the bed. Plenty of room for... you know...""  
  
I flush so hard I feel like my face is on fire. ""S\*\*t up.""  
  
He laughs again, and I know I'm in trouble. Big trouble.

I don't know if I pick them badly, but they doesn't seem to find the balance between shared pleasure and toxic domination.

Why do they always want to gag me, and block my head while doing it ? There is no pleasure in feeling like you're gonna throw up or having a sore throat.

Stop pulling or busting my balls. I get pain for days. That's not cool.
And please pinch my tits bit but not to the point it is painful for days.

And why do I have to justify to pick lube before we fuck. No your saliva isn't better than lube. And no I don't want to shit blood the next morning because you can't wait 30 seconds.

And chems now ? Why the fuck ? Aren't we already getting à ton of pleasure just kissing cuddling sucking and fucking ?

What's next ? Oh you want to whip me with your belt ? With the buckle ? You want permanent marks on my ass ? Oh gawd

And no, nutting into my mouth or my ass doesn't make me yours, doesn't mean I belong to you, doesn't mean I'm your bitch available when you have time after work or when your partner cancels your plans, doesn't mean I love you, doesn't mean you have any kind of right on me to allow me to have sex or to meet people...

And making me cum too ?
Oh comme on that rarely happens as well.


Also no, being top doesn't mean you have ANY right to decide anything for me, from how I make my coffee to what I should watch on TV. You're not above me. You're not deciding for me. It's just a sexual position, not a social rank!


Yeah sexing can be the beginning of a special bond but not when the above stuff happened. It's nice to be nice, and to make partners feel nice.

I'm doing a lot for your pleasure and in return I get treated with little to no respect. I'm not a hole here solely for your pleasure.


I don't know, 10-15 years ago sex was fun and pleasurable - and it even led to meeting guys, to make friends, to start relationships ... and have more than just sex and go like a fucking Uber order.

Now it just feels like an endless chain of sad hookups with people cheating on their partners or in open relationships, that I end up taking because otherwise I'm alone.


So do I pick the wrong guys ?
Do the fact they have relationships mean they only want sex ? What's up with all the married with children straight that want a free bitch ???


Sorry for the long rant by I'm pissed and salty

I’m posting on behalf of my mother (54) because our family is really desperate for answers. She has been struggling with this for 20 years, but it’s getting worse and doctors haven’t found the cause.

The symptoms:
- Severe pain starts after eating (sometimes 15 minutes later, sometimes up to an hour).
- Pain begins in her stomach and spreads through her whole abdomen and into her back. It’s so intense she can’t find any position to relieve it.
- Episodes last ~20 minutes (used to be ~10 minutes, but getting longer and worse). Then it slowly subsides, and usually she’s fine for the rest of the day.
- Sometimes vomiting and diarrhea during attacks (1x per week before, now up to 3x per week). 
- She gets very hot during these episodes.
- Severity varies.
- She does not get this after every meal. There is no clear pattern – sometimes a very small snack (like coffee and half a banana) triggers a severe attack, other times she can eat a large meal with no issue.
- Attacks are now almost daily, sometimes 2x per day.
- Because of this, she avoids eating, has lost significant weight, and is afraid to eat outside the home.

History & testing:
- 20+ years of symptoms, first referred to hospital 15 years ago.
- Multiple GI investigations: endoscopy, colonoscopy, scans, ultrasounds, food allergy/intolerance testing. All normal.
- Doctors don’t know what else to test. She is currently on a (long) waitlist for a specialist center.
- We notice stress may play a role, but no consistent pattern.
- She has lost a lot of weight in the last 2 years.

Has anyone seen a case like this before? What possible conditions could cause such severe, unpredictable post-meal pain with normal GI workups? And are there specific tests or specialists we should be asking about? Please let me know if there are other/ better subreddits to post this. 

We’re very worried because her quality of life is going down and the situation is worsening.
Thank you so much for any input.

1nu6ioz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1nu6ioz/how_aipowered_custom_crms_are_redefining_customer/,How AI-Powered Custom CRMs Are Redefining Customer Engagement,"When it comes to customer engagement, let’s be honest—“good enough” no longer cuts it. Customers don’t just want service, they want seamless experiences, faster responses, and a little bit of predictive magic (the kind where you know what they need before they even say it). That’s where AI-powered custom CRMs step in, quietly rewriting the rules of engagement while most businesses are still trying to color inside the lines of their off-the-shelf [CRM software](https://kanhasoft.com/crm-software-development.html).

At Kanhasoft, we’ve seen this shift firsthand. One of our clients once told us their old CRM felt like a glorified spreadsheet with commitment issues—it tracked things (sometimes), but never helped the team actually connect with customers. And that’s the crux of the problem: engagement requires intelligence, not just storage.

# Why Customer Engagement Needs a Makeover

We’ve all noticed it—customers have evolved. (Some might say faster than most companies can keep up with.) They’re no longer impressed by the fact that you remember their name in an email. They expect personalization, proactive problem-solving, and communication that feels like a dialogue instead of a broadcast.

Generic CRMs, unfortunately, tend to work like an old GPS: they’ll get you somewhere, but probably not where you intended. Custom CRMs, especially when powered by AI, are like having Waze with real-time traffic, hidden routes, and maybe even a friendly voice that says, “Hey, don’t take that turn—it’s a dead end.”

# Enter AI-Powered Custom CRMs (The Game Changer)

Artificial intelligence brings three things to the CRM party: predictive insights, automation, and personalization. Let’s break that down without sounding like a tech manual.

1. Predictive Insights – Imagine knowing which customers are about to churn, which leads are most likely to close, and which product will be the next hot ticket item. That’s not fortune telling—it’s AI doing its homework (using historical data and behavioral analysis).
2. Automation – Remember when your sales team had to manually log every customer interaction? (Cue collective groan.) AI automates those repetitive tasks, freeing humans to do what they’re actually good at: building relationships.
3. Personalization – Here’s the kicker. AI doesn’t just help you address “John” instead of “Dear Customer.” It learns patterns, preferences, and timing—so your CRM nudges John at exactly the right moment, with exactly the right message. (Basically, it makes you look like a mind reader without the weird crystal ball.)

# A Personal Observation (Because We’ve Been There Too)

We once had a project where a retail client in the UAE was struggling with repeat customers. They had the data, but it was scattered, outdated, and about as useful as a library with no catalog. We built a [custom AI-powered CRM](https://kanhasoft.com/crm-software-development.html) that connected purchase history, seasonal buying trends, and even regional holidays. Suddenly, they weren’t just sending promotions—they were sending the right promotions at the right time. Their customer engagement rates shot up, and one manager joked that it felt like the CRM knew their customers better than they did.

(We didn’t tell him that was exactly the point.)

# How AI Custom CRMs Work Across Regions (USA, UK, Israel, Switzerland, UAE)

Different markets, different expectations—but the same underlying truth: customers want relevance.

* USA – Speed and convenience are king. AI-driven CRMs help businesses anticipate needs and respond before competitors do.
* UK – Personalization is key, but so is privacy. Custom CRMs balance GDPR compliance with AI personalization.
* Israel – Tech-savvy customers expect innovation; AI CRMs deliver real-time insights and faster scaling.
* Switzerland – Precision matters. CRMs here focus on data accuracy, multilingual capabilities, and compliance.
* UAE – Engagement thrives on timing (cultural events, regional holidays). AI custom CRMs ensure messaging is not just timely, but culturally relevant.

# What Businesses Gain (Spoiler: It’s More Than Sales)

Sure, AI-powered custom CRMs boost sales—but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Businesses also see:

* Stronger customer loyalty (because who doesn’t love feeling understood?)
* Smarter resource allocation (goodbye manual drudgery, hello efficiency)
* Faster decision-making (AI insights mean no more “gut-feel” guesses)
* Happier teams (because nobody dreams of spending 3 hours logging calls)

# Transitioning from Legacy CRMs (Yes, It’s Possible Without Tears)

We often hear, “But we’ve invested so much in our old CRM!” True, but investing in a legacy system that doesn’t serve your needs is like clinging to a flip phone because you paid full price in 2005. Transitioning to a custom AI-powered CRM doesn’t have to be painful—when done right, it feels more like an upgrade than a funeral.

# Humor Break: CRMs and Dating Apps

Here’s a fun analogy we’ve used before: CRMs are like dating apps. Off-the-shelf CRMs give you generic matches (likes hiking, enjoys pizza), but rarely capture the depth you’re looking for. A [custom AI-powered CRM](https://kanhasoft.com/crm-software-development.html)? That’s the one that introduces you to your soulmate, remembers your anniversary, and knows you take your coffee black—without you even asking.

# Future Trends in AI-Driven Customer Engagement

Looking ahead, we see several trends shaping the next wave of customer engagement:

* Conversational AI – CRMs integrating with chatbots that sound human (minus the awkward pauses).
* Voice Recognition – Imagine logging a customer query just by speaking.
* Hyper-Personalization – Every interaction tailored down to micro-preferences.
* Predictive Customer Journeys – Mapping what customers will do next before they know it themselves.

Spoiler: businesses that adopt these early will lead the pack.

# FAQs

Q1: What is a custom CRM?  
A custom CRM is a tailor-made customer relationship management system designed to fit your unique business processes, unlike off-the-shelf CRMs that force you to adapt to their structure.

Q2: How does AI improve customer engagement?  
AI analyzes customer behavior, automates repetitive tasks, and delivers personalized experiences—helping businesses engage with customers at the right time with the right message.

Q3: Is AI-powered CRM safe for data privacy?  
Yes, with proper compliance (like GDPR in the UK and EU), AI-powered CRMs can be both powerful and secure. At Kanhasoft, we prioritize security alongside innovation.

Q4: Can small businesses benefit from AI CRMs?  
Absolutely. Small businesses often see faster ROI because AI tools free up limited resources and give them competitive advantages against larger players.

Q5: How much does custom AI-powered CRM development cost?  
Costs vary depending on features, integrations, and complexity. But unlike off-the-shelf tools, a custom CRM ensures you only pay for what you actually use.

# Conclusion

At [Kanhasoft](https://kanhasoft.com/), we believe customer engagement is no longer about just managing relationships—it’s about elevating them. [AI-powered custom CRMs](https://kanhasoft.com/crm-software-development.html) don’t just keep track of interactions; they redefine how businesses connect with people. Whether you’re in New York, London, Tel Aviv, Zurich, or Dubai, the principle remains the same: intelligent, timely, and personalized engagement is what turns casual buyers into loyal advocates.

And here’s the kicker—while technology may be the enabler, it’s still about people at the core. The best CRMs? They don’t just crunch data; they make businesses more human.",2,1759216265.0,CRM,0,1.0,False

TL;DR: I met a ballet dancer last winter and what started casually turned into something deeper for me. We both knew long-term would be hard because she was moving to Berlin and I’m in London, but I slowly fell in love. While I was away working in Japan, she pulled away and grew cold. When we saw each other again it was distant; she said we should just be friends. I told her I liked her too much for that, and she kindly but firmly ended it. It’s been a few days and I feel depressed, anxious, and stuck. I know stopping makes sense, but I miss her badly and don’t know how to move on and I don’t feel okay. 

——————————- 


This is going to be long and maybe a bit heavy. I’m trying to move on, but I’m struggling, and I don’t really understand why this one hit me so hard. Maybe just writing it will help. I am just so sad. 

Lately, I have felt depressed, anxious, overworked and stuck. I know I should feel grateful; many people would love my life, but I’m not happy. And now, on top of that, I miss her.

She’s a ballet dancer. We met in December on a dating app, had a drink, and kissed. At first we lost contact, but around Easter my flight home was cancelled and I ended up stuck in London, so I reached out. We went to the ballet together. She put her hand on my leg during the show; afterwards we had drinks and she stayed over. From there, it turned into what people call a “situationship.”

At first, I was still seeing other people, but I quickly chose her. She was charming, funny, romantic by message, witty and warm, though sometimes I sensed struggles she did not want to share. Her family is complicated and she is unhappy at work.

From the beginning, we both knew it probably could not become a long-term relationship. She had to move to Berlin for an intense new job and I was tied to London. Still, we kept seeing each other, texting, and building something quietly real. I did not realise how much I was falling for her until later.

In June, I left for a project in Japan just as she was moving to Berlin. The time spent together was wonderful and romantic. We were laughing a lot together. She is really beautiful. She would do a lot of small (because she does not like to show her emotions) but very romantic gestures, for my birthday she gave me a card, or we would spend hours in the park lying on the grass with her head resting in me. Our last weekend together was wonderful. When I left, she texted me “remember me.” I replied with something emotional too. I think I truly was in love.

Japan hit me hard. I felt exhausted, lonely and overwhelmed by work. At first she stayed close by message, but soon her replies grew short and cold. I tried to respect her space. The problem was that before things cooled, I had already sent her a package with a letter and a book. When she received it, I texted her to apologise for sending it at a time when things felt distant. She told me not to be sorry, that she still thought about me, had not moved on, and that we had both been quiet. But her actions felt different from her words. Her texts were still cold and she would not reply to my romantic messages. Still, we kissed, I gave her a gift from Japan and she seemed a little embarrassed, and I felt a flicker of what we had in the summer. She had not read the book I had sent.

After five weeks in Japan I came back to Europe for a month, hoping to visit her in Berlin one weekend. But I sensed she was not keen. Her friends/colleagues are really alternative and she might not want me to meet them. I am not sure why, I know I would love it and would not judge quite the opposite I wouldn’t be so attracted to her if she was not that different from my friends and background. She came to London to see her family and I tried to meet. We managed a coffee and it was nice but distant. She cancelled other plans and moved times around. I can understand; she was here mainly for her family. We agreed to meet again the next day, but she cancelled last minute. I said I really wanted to see her and she agreed to a quick coffee Monday morning before I had to work. I even lied at work to make it happen. I had hoped to have her lying next to me one more time, not for sex, but just her calming presence, her scent, her beautiful eyes. I miss that so much. We talked, kissed again, and held hands. She mentioned she had not had any physical closeness in a while and did not want things to become confusing. I felt bad and apologised. She said it was okay and nice but that things were too complicated and we should stay friends.

That night I could not sleep. I felt anxious and desperate. I read some of our early messages and realised how much things had changed. I drafted a long message explaining why I liked her so much and why I could not just be friends. Before I could send it, she unexpectedly texted me good morning and reacted to my stories. I was surprised and tried to talk, but her replies were cold and small.

After a few days of trying to keep things alive and being a little romantic, I realised it hurt more to try when she cannot match. So on Thursday I decided to stop pretending. I sent her a voice message telling her I liked her too much to be just friends. I shared parts of the message I had written, all the reasons she was special and the memories I will keep.

She replied kindly but firmly did not react to the memories I shared. She said she understood but did not think it was good to continue something when we are on such different paths. She said it is hard for her to be romantically invested when there is no practical way forward and no certainty of seeing each other. She thanked me for the time we spent and said she was fond of me. But it was clear she was drawing a line, maybe out of respect, maybe because she knows it is the best choice.

It has been five days. I miss her terribly. Friday I go back to Japan for four weeks with more work and more isolation. I told myself I will not contact her until after, but it is hard.

I think I have some anxious attachment and she might be more avoidant. Her sudden switch hurt deeply. Rationally, I know the distance and timing make us almost impossible. Emotionally, I just want her to say “I miss you too, maybe we will see each other again.”

I know I am valuable: good job, nice person, decent looking. But rejection still stings. I am surprised by how depressed I feel when I knew from the start this might end. How can people manage to switch so fast, to cope that well, why can’t I? I want to move on but at the same time I don’t want to forget. She probably does not think it was as nice as I do. 

I want to learn to be okay alone, to stop spiralling. I wonder if my sadness is just normal heartbreak or if something is wrong with me.",1,1759216171.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

For so long, I believed that in order to heal, I had to erase the pain, the trauma, the mistakes, the diagnoses, the battles with my body, and everything that broke me along the way.
But the truth is...the scars remain. The memories remain.
The challenges still exist.
Healing, for me, has been about loosening the grip those things have had on my heart and my worth. It's learning to live with what l've been through, but not letting it define every step I take. It's forgiving myself for the times I pushed too hard, giving myself grace when my body feels heavy, and reminding myself daily that I am not broken, I am becoming.
The damage, the hurt and the scars will always be part of my story. But it no longer has the power to write my ending.

I’m posting on behalf of my mother (54) because our family is really desperate for answers. She has been struggling with this for 20 years, but it’s getting worse and doctors haven’t found the cause.

The symptoms:
- Severe pain starts after eating (sometimes 15 minutes later, sometimes up to an hour).
- Pain begins in her stomach and spreads through her whole abdomen and into her back. It’s so intense she can’t find any position to relieve it.
- Episodes last ~20 minutes (used to be ~10 minutes, but getting longer and worse). Then it slowly subsides, and usually she’s fine for the rest of the day.
- Sometimes vomiting and diarrhea during attacks (1x per week before, now up to 3x per week). 
- She gets very hot during these episodes.
- Severity varies.
- She does not get this after every meal. There is no clear pattern – sometimes a very small snack (like coffee and half a banana) triggers a severe attack, other times she can eat a large meal with no issue.
- Attacks are now almost daily, sometimes 2x per day.
- Because of this, she avoids eating, has lost significant weight, and is afraid to eat outside the home.

History & testing:
- 20+ years of symptoms, first referred to hospital 15 years ago.
- Multiple GI investigations: endoscopy, colonoscopy, scans, ultrasounds, food allergy/intolerance testing. All normal.
- Doctors don’t know what else to test. She is currently on a (long) waitlist for a specialist center.
- We notice stress may play a role, but no consistent pattern.
- She has lost a lot of weight in the last 2 years.

Has anyone seen a case like this before? What possible conditions could cause such severe, unpredictable post-meal pain with normal GI workups? And are there specific tests or specialists we should be asking about? Please let me know if there are other/ better subreddits to post this. 

We’re very worried because her quality of life is going down and the situation is worsening.
Thank you so much for any input.

1nu6fwc,https://i.redd.it/iph6bfe449sf1.png,Elena Porter discovered her husband's secret life,"Elena Porter discovered her husband's secret life at 3:47 PM outside an elementary school. She watched in stunned silence as the man she'd married embraced another woman and kissed a little girl who called him ""Daddy.""



But this devastating discovery was only the beginning. Her three-year marriage, her four-year relationship, her entire life had been an elaborate con game. Her in-laws, her best friend, even the prestigious art gallery where she worked—everyone was in on the conspiracy, all for one prize: her massive inheritance that was about to come through.



They thought she was just a grateful orphan who would accept any scraps of affection. They thought she was weak, naive, easy to control. They were about to discover that an underestimated woman is the most dangerous enemy of all.



……



My name was Elena Porter, and I believed I had found my forever family. After growing up bouncing between relatives who saw me as a burden, the Whitmore family had taken me in during college. Their daughter Sarah had become my best friend, their son Marcus my devoted husband of three years. I was an art curator at their prestigious gallery, surrounded by beauty and love.



It was all perfectly, devastatingly false.



The crack in my perfect world appeared on a Thursday morning. Marcus had left early for a ""client meeting in the art district,"" kissing me goodbye with the same tenderness he'd shown every morning since our wedding. But when I arrived at the gallery, Sarah mentioned offhandedly that she'd seen Marcus's car parked outside Bella Vista Elementary School the previous day.



""Strange,"" she'd laughed. ""What would he be doing there?""



The question haunted me through my morning rounds of the gallery. Marcus didn't know any children. We'd been trying to start a family for two years, but he'd insisted we wait until his architecture firm was more established. The timing never seemed right.



That afternoon, I drove to Bella Vista Elementary. The school day was ending, and I watched from across the street as children streamed out toward waiting parents. And there, unmistakably, was Marcus. He stood beside a silver SUV I'd never seen before, his arms open wide as a little girl with dark curls ran toward him, shouting ""Daddy!""



My world tilted on its axis.



The girl looked about six years old. She had Marcus's green eyes and his dimpled smile. As I watched in stunned silence, a woman emerged from the driver's seat of the SUV. Tall, elegant, with honey-blonde hair – everything I wasn't. She kissed Marcus on the lips with casual familiarity while the little girl chattered excitedly about her day.



I sat frozen in my car, watching my husband – my husband – lift this child onto his shoulders and climb into the passenger seat of another woman's car. They drove away like the family I thought we were trying to build.



The betrayal hit me in waves. First shock, then denial, then a crushing realization that transformed every memory of our relationship into a lie. How long had this been going on? Who was this woman? And why was Marcus pretending to love me when he clearly had a whole other life?



I drove home in a daze, my hands shaking on the steering wheel. When Marcus returned that evening, he kissed me hello and asked about my day as if nothing had changed.



""The client meeting went well,"" he said, loosening his tie. ""Mr. Peterson finally approved the museum renovation designs.""



Another lie. How many others had there been?



That night, as Marcus slept peacefully beside me, I stared at the ceiling and realized that the man I'd shared a bed with for three years was a complete stranger.



2

\##Chapter 2



I couldn't confront Marcus immediately. I needed proof, and more importantly, I needed to understand the scope of the deception. Was Sarah involved? Were her parents, William and Patricia Whitmore, who'd given me a job and treated me like a daughter, part of this elaborate charade?



The next morning, I called in sick to the gallery – the first sick day I'd taken in two years. Instead, I drove to the address I'd found by following the silver SUV's license plate through an online database. It led me to an upscale neighborhood across town, to a beautiful Victorian house with a garden full of roses.



Through careful observation from a coffee shop across the street, I learned that the woman's name was Victoria Manning. She was a pediatrician with her own practice. The little girl was named Emma, and she attended private school and ballet classes. They lived a comfortable, seemingly perfect life.



What I couldn't understand was how Marcus afforded this double life. His architecture firm was successful, but not wealthy enough to support two households. That's when I remembered the joint account William Whitmore had opened for Marcus and me as a wedding gift. The account we barely used because Marcus insisted on maintaining our separate finances ""for independence.""



I accessed the account online that afternoon. What I found made my blood run cold.



Regular transfers. Large ones. From William Whitmore's personal account to ours, and then immediately transferred out to an account I didn't recognize. For three years, my father-in-law had been funding this secret life, and Marcus had been funneling the money to support his other family.



The pattern was meticulous. Every month, the same amount. Always with a memo that read ""Family Support - E.M."" Emma Manning.



My entire world – the job at the gallery, the beautiful apartment Marcus and I shared, even my relationship with Sarah – was built on lie after lie. The Whitmores hadn't just known about Marcus's secret family; they were actively funding it.



But why?



That evening, I sat at our dining room table, surrounded by financial documents I'd printed, when Marcus came home. He looked tired, stressed in a way I'd attributed to work pressure. Now I wondered if the strain came from maintaining his double life.



""You're home early,"" I said, keeping my voice level.



""Light day at the office,"" he replied, hanging his coat in the closet. ""How are you feeling? Better?""



The concern in his voice sounded genuine. That was perhaps the cruelest part – Marcus wasn't a cartoon villain. He was tender with me, attentive, seemingly loving. Which made his betrayal feel like a knife twisted in my chest.



""Much better,"" I lied. ""Marcus, can I ask you something?""



He settled beside me on the couch, his attention focused and caring. ""Of course.""



""Do you ever want children? Really want them?""



Something flickered across his face – too quick for me to interpret. ""You know I do. We've talked about this. When the time is right—""",1,1759215967.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

# 

When I first considered ways to promote our brand during events and daily operations, I focused on traditional methods like banners, flyers, and merchandise. But then I [stumbled upon Paper Cup Printing as a potential marketing tool](http://aquaholic.com.sg/drinkwares/paper-cup-printing/), and it completely changed my approach. Initially, I thought paper cups were just functional items for serving beverages. However, once I explored Custom Paper Cups with lid and Disposable Cup Printing, I realized they could serve as an effective, cost-efficient branding solution.

In this article, I’ll share my first-hand experience using Custom Paper Cups for marketing, what I learned about the printing process, and why I now consider branded coffee cups one of the most practical promotional tools.

# Why I Chose Paper Cups as a Marketing Tool

Our company wanted a marketing tool that would reach customers in everyday settings without appearing intrusive. Traditional giveaways like pens, tote bags, or mugs often have limited exposure, whereas a Custom Paper Cup can be seen and used repeatedly throughout the day.

I realized that a simple paper cup becomes a mobile billboard when designed properly. A Printed Coffee Cup carrying the brand logo and message can travel from cafés to offices, to meetings, and even into homes. Compared to costly outdoor advertisements, paper cups offer repeated brand exposure at a fraction of the cost.

# The Benefits of Branded Paper Cups

From my experience, I identified several advantages of using Custom Disposable Cups for marketing:

# 1. High Visibility

Every time a customer carries a branded coffee cup, the logo is in plain view—not just to them, but also to people around them. The repeated exposure builds brand recognition without any aggressive promotion.

# 2. Cost-Effectiveness

One of the main reasons I embraced Paper Cup Printing was its [affordability](https://www.aquaholic.com.sg/corporate-gifts/how-paper-cup-printing-helps-cafes-stand-out-in-competitive-markets/). Ordering Custom Paper Cups in bulk significantly reduced the cost per unit. This allowed us to distribute cups widely, from cafés to events, without breaking the marketing budget.

# 3. Customisation Flexibility

I was surprised by the variety of customisation options available:

* Printed Coffee Cups for daily café use  
* Custom Paper Cups with lid for takeaway beverages  
* Unique designs for seasonal promotions or limited-time campaigns  

The flexibility of Disposable Cup Printing allowed me to experiment with logos, slogans, and creative visuals that aligned perfectly with our brand identity.

# 4. Practicality and Functionality

Unlike many promotional items that can sit unused, Custom Paper Cups are inherently functional. People drink coffee or tea daily, so the cups naturally find their way into active use. This practicality increases brand exposure and ensures that the promotional item is not wasted.

# 5. Versatility

Branded coffee cups work in a variety of settings—cafés, corporate events, school activities, or even outdoor festivals. I found that they fit seamlessly into almost any marketing scenario, making them highly versatile.

My Paper Cup Printing Process

When I first embarked on Paper Cup Printing, I had little experience, so I learned through research, vendor consultations, and hands-on experimentation. Here’s how I approached it:

# 1. Design and Branding

I discovered that design is key to making paper cups effective marketing tools. Clear, bold logos and simple messages worked best. Overly complicated graphics tend to get lost on the small, curved surface of a cup.

I also learned to consider contrast and colour. Bright, eye-catching colours drew attention, while maintaining readability. This was especially important for [takeaway](https://dailyaberdeenuknews.com/2025/01/03/custom-paper-cups) Custom Paper Cups with lid, where visibility from a distance matters.

# 2. Selecting the Right Supplier

Working with a reliable Paper Cup Supplier in Singapore made all the difference. I collaborated with Aquaholic Gifts, a leading vendor known for Disposable Cup Printing. While I won’t overly promote them, their guidance on material choice, printing techniques, and minimum order quantities was invaluable.

# 3. Material and Type Choices

Not all paper cups are created equal. I learned to match the cup type with the intended use:

* Standard paper cups for in-store use  
* Cups with lids for takeaway beverages  
* Premium cups for special events or corporate gifts  

The choice of material impacted both the durability of the cup and the quality of the print, so it was crucial to choose wisely.

# 4. Printing Techniques

I explored several Paper Cup Printing methods:

* Offset Printing: Ideal for large-scale orders with intricate designs.  
* Digital Printing: Offers flexibility for smaller batches or customised campaigns.  
* Spot Colour Printing: Cost-effective for simple logos and bold branding.  

Experimenting with these methods helped me understand the trade-offs between cost, quality, and flexibility.

# Cost Considerations

One of the biggest advantages I discovered was the cost-effectiveness of Custom Paper Cups. Here’s what I learned:

1. Bulk Orders Reduce Costs Ordering Custom Paper Cups in bulk lowered the unit price significantly. This made wide distribution feasible without stretching the budget.  
2. Design Impacts Cost Simpler designs with fewer colours were cheaper to produce. I learned to balance creativity with cost-efficiency, creating impactful branding without overspending.  
3. Material Choice Matters Premium cups with lids or thicker paper cost more but provided a higher perceived value. For everyday use, standard cups worked perfectly, offering a great return on investment.  

# Observed Impact

After using Custom Paper Cups in several campaigns, I noticed clear benefits:

* Brand Recall: Customers and clients commented on the eye-catching designs, and the cups became conversation starters.  
* Practical Engagement: People used the cups repeatedly, extending the marketing reach beyond a single event.  
* Positive Perception: Well-designed, functional cups reflected positively on our brand, suggesting quality and attention to detail.  

These results convinced me that paper cup printing is more than just a functional choice—it’s a strategic marketing tool.

# Lessons I Learned

From my first-hand experience, these key takeaways stood out:

* Design Simplicity Works: Bold logos and clear messaging are more effective than complex graphics.  
* Bulk Orders Save Money: Economies of scale make widespread distribution affordable.  
* Material Matters: The type of cup affects durability, print quality, and perceived value.  
* Work With Experienced Vendors: A knowledgeable supplier like Aquaholic Gifts ensures high-quality output and helps navigate design and printing challenges.  
* Functionality Drives Engagement: Giving away something people will actually use increases brand exposure and impact.  

# Final Thoughts

Through my journey with Paper Cup Printing, I discovered that these everyday items can be powerful, cost-effective marketing tools. From Branded Coffee Cups to Custom Disposable Cups and Custom Paper Cups with lid, there is a wide range of options to suit different campaigns, events, and branding goals.

Working with a trusted Paper Cup Supplier in Singapore streamlined the process and ensured that the cups were not only visually appealing but also functional and durable. Now, whenever I see someone using one of our branded coffee cups, I’m reminded that even a simple paper cup can deliver significant marketing impact when used strategically.

For businesses or organisations looking to expand brand visibility affordably, I highly recommend exploring Custom Paper Cup Printing. They are practical, versatile, and leave a lasting impression—proof that even the simplest items can become powerful tools in a well-thought-out marketing strategy.

1nu6beu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1nu6beu/i_will_still_pray_for_you/,I will still pray for you.,"To bebii cakes my love,

How are you? Are you doing okay na? Don't get sick please. Huwag ka masyado magpuyat sa games, okay? Try to get enough sleep. I miss you bebii love. I miss you so much.

Ginagawa ko na lahat para hindi ka maisip. I am doing everything para mapigilan ko ang sarili ko na imessage ka. Nagdeactivate na ko ng social media para hindi ako matempt icheck ang profile mo. I can't even remove our story highlights so I just deactivated my account. Kahit I'm in the middle of doing something, bigla kitang naiisip. I was watching a funny anime kahapon pero as I was laughing sa isang scene, bigla nalang akong naiyak dahil bigla kang pumasok sa isip ko. Hindi ko na natapos pinapanood ko and pumasok nalang sa kwarto, hindi ko na kinaya yung bigat and the rest of the day nagkulong nalang ako sa room. I thought I was doing fine na kasi hindi na ako naiiyak kapag naaalala kita the past few days. Akala ko lang pala. Muntik na kitang imessage sa number mo haha. Buti nalang napigilan ko. I did good, right? I gave you the space you want and I will continue to do that kahit nahihirapan ako.

Tinanggap ko na yung gusto mong hiwalayan, Love, kahit ayoko. I know hindi mo na ako mahal. Hindi mo na ako babalikan. You don't care about me anymore. Ramdam ko yon. Even before ka pa manghingi ng space para makapagisip-isip, I know you're already out the door. Fall out of love? I think so. Our conversation got shorter each day. Yung video call naten everyday after work, dumalang. Hindi ka na sumasagot kapag sinasabihan kita ng 'i love you'. Sasagot kalang kapag binibiro kita at nagkukunwari akong nagtatampo. That one hurt a lot. Palagi mong sinasabing mahal mo ako everyday eh. Palagi kong nararamdaman na mahal mo ako kahit pa busy ka. We always send memes or random talks in the middle of the day. Alam mo yon? Hindi tayo magkasama pero I know we are still part of each others day. Doon palang alam kong nag-iba na feelings mo sakin. Kapag nagovernight ako sa apartment mo, we don't talk like we used to. I can feel the emotional distance between us growing everyday and I can't do anything about it. I don't even remember how many nights I cried myself to sleep with you beside me. I always hug you while you sleep, tahimik na umiiyak, kasi i'm scared na that will be the last time I get to sleep beside you.

Are you disappointed in me? Dahil nawalan nanaman ako ng work? Hindi maalis sa isip ko na isa to sa rason bakit nakipaghiwalay ka. I thought makakabawi na ko sayo this time nung natanggap ako sa work na to eh, but the universe is really not on my side. I know its not my fault na unemployed ako but I can't stop blaming myself. Maybe napagod ka na kakahintay magkawork ulit ako. I am doing my best na makahanap agad ng malilipatan. The moment na nalaman kong mawawalan ako ng trabaho, I started looking for new work opportunities agad, sa bus palang nagchecheck na ko ng job postings. Kahit nga hindi na sya align sa gusto kong career path and hindi match sa experience ko, pinapasahan ko na. Madami tayong plano eh. Ayokong mapause yung plans natin dahil sakin. Hindi ko sinasabi sayo before kapag may inapplayan ako or anong nangyare sa sinend kong applications, because I don't want you to be disappointed din. Ayoko din magbago yung tingin mo sakin, na ang incompetent ko pala. So I only tell you kapag napasok sa usapan natin or nag-ask ka. I'm sorry for failing you, loveyyy.

I greatly appreciate all the things you did for me. Sa lahat ng dates na ikaw muna ang sumagot. Sa pagdala sakin sa mga lugar na hindi ko pa napupuntahan. Sa pag-aalaga sakin and princess treatment kapag nagpupunta ako sa apartment mo. And many more. I know hindi ko mapantayan yung binibigay mo lalo na sa gastos kapag gumagala tayo. Sobrang nagiguilty ako kapag may binibigay ka na alam kong posibleng magipit or malaki impact sa budget mo, lalo na solo living ka. I don't want to accept minsan kaso ayokong mahurt ka pag tinanggihan ko. So I showed appreciation sa paraang alam ko and kaya ko. I hoped na by doing these little things, mafeel mong sobrang mahal kita and I see all you do para saakin, para satin. I made sure to allocate part of my savings para atleast kapag may occasion, birthday, Valentines, Christmas, etc., may maibibigay pa din akong gift sayo. I made sure to listen kapag nagvevent ka about sa work mo and super stressed ka. Tinatandaan ko din yung mga kwento mo about your day, sa mga nakakalaro mo, about sa nilalaro mong games. Kapag nagshare ka about sa plans mo, lipat ng apartment or gusto mo magside hustle, I tried to be supportive and nag-iisip na din ako ano bang pwede kong maitulong sayo para kahit papano hindi ka mahirapan. Kapag nagstay ako sa apartment mo for few days, I cleaned around, made sure na walang kalat and maayos lahat para pag-uwi mo, we can just eat and you can destress for the day. I wanted to cook for you before ka makauwi kaso mas masarap ka kasi magluto haha. And you said once before na narerelax ka pag nagluluto ka pagkauwi, part sya ng ritual mo to destress so I just helped in small things like hiwa ng sibuyas at bawang, kuha ng ingredients sa ref, anything I can do para makatulong sa pagluluto. May passive income ako, hindi sya ganoon kalaki pero kapag may sobra, ako naman nagoffer na ilibre ka, like coffee or anything you like. I hoped this was enough to atleast show you na I am genuinely trying na makabawi. I really love you. Pasensya ka na if gantong way lang ako nakatulong sayo. 

I don't want to be one of the people na nagpapabigat sa buhay mo. I wanted to be your support. The peace between all the chaos of everyday life. The one who quiets your mind when everything is loud. But no matter how much I wanted to be that person for you, no matter what I do, no matter how hard I pray to be that person, it seems that I am not. So babaguhin ko ang prayers ko for us, bebii love 🥹
I pray na you find the person who can be all of that for you and more. The one who can be your greatest support. Who'll be with you every step of the way while you build the life you want. I pray that you succeed in every thing you choose to do. Career. Investments. Genuine happiness. Love. Health. Safety and protection. I'll pray for all of that for you. You deserve all of that, my love. For me, I pray that I survive this heartache and move forward with my life, to give me strength everyday.

With lots of love,

I (male) asked out a lady who happens to be my customer. She agreed at first and gave me her number. We planned to meet for coffee, but a day before the meetup, when I asked her to confirm, she said she isn’t available for dating.

Next time she came in as a customer, she apologized. I told her I wasn’t looking for anything serious, just something casual. She said she’d think about it.

A few days later, she told me I’m sweet and even called me handsome.

Now I’m confused about where this stands. Are we just friends at this point? Is she keeping the door slightly open, or is she just being polite?

*By Your Humble Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Figure Out Why Anyone Roots for the Underdog*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For**  
Let’s cut through the baseball jargon and talk numbers. The **Yokohama DeNA BayStars** are the consensus favorite here, with odds hovering around **-150 to -160** (decimal: \~1.41). That translates to an implied probability of **\~60%** to win—basically, the sportsbooks think they’re as reliable as a microwave that actually heats your coffee. The **Tokyo Yakult Swallows**, meanwhile, are priced at **+265 to +290** (decimal: \~2.85), implying a **\~34%** chance. To put that in perspective, you’re more likely to find a four-leaf clover in a parking lot than see the Swallows pull off an upset here.

The spread? Yokohama is **-1.5 runs**, meaning they’re expected to outscore Tokyo by at least two runs. The total runs line sits at **6.5**, with even money on Over/Under. Given Tokyo’s youth movement and Yokohama’s presumably stable roster, “Over” might be the more thrilling bet—unless you’re a masochist who enjoys watching teams “play small ball” like it’s a 19th-century board game.

---

**Digesting the News: Rebuilding, Retirements, and Reluctant Reliance on Grandpas**  
The **Yakult Swallows** are in the throes of a full-scale reboot. Their star slugger, **Murakami S.**, is packing his bags for MLB after a historic seven-season home-run streak—imagine losing your team’s human cannonball to a rival league. Add in the retirement of veteran pitcher **Shingo Kawabata** and the impending departure of 16-year veteran **Yamada Tetsuto**, and it’s like watching a symphony orchestra replace its conductor, first violinist, and cellist all at once.

To fill the gaps? The Swallows are leaning on **Uchiyama Souma**, a 23-year-old first baseman who’s having a breakout season (.271 BA, 8 HRs), and a pitching staff that includes **45-year-old Ishikawa Masaki** and **14-year-old Ogawa Yasuhiro** (yes, *14*). It’s the baseball equivalent of a grandfather and his pre-teen grandson trying to pitch a tent in a hurricane. Th

a loaded caliber.

I tiptoe around it,
praying it won't see me,

Everyone believes they're bulletproof until the gun is grabbing your hair, shoving your head down into the barrel.

1nu64pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1nu64pj/what_helped_me/,What helped me,"Hi all, I wanted to share my experience. It is unlikely to be a solution for everyone, but if it helps one of you then that's great.

I have been dealing with hormonal migraines since I was very young, they got a bit better in my 20s then much worse in my 30s.

I have used preventitives (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, beta blockers, hypertension medications) and painkillers (almost all the triptanes) with mixed results.

I have been through very debilitating phases. At some point anything was a trigger (little light, too much light, coffee smell or any smell, walking too far, doing too little). For a few of years I stopped having a social life and did little excercise, I just couldn't cope with the constant pain andvthe anxiety was sky high.

Recently, for different reasons, I decided to track my nutrition: macros, fibers, salt, general variety. I had always thought I had a relatively healthy nutrition, but boy I was wrong.

I started increasing my protein intake as it was well below my needs, eat more complex carbs to fuel my excercise, drastically reduce the amount of UPFs, introduce a variety of fat sources like seeds and nuts. I keep my excercise consistent and I make sure I schedule rest days. I am still bad at going to bed early, as there is always so much to do at work and at home, but I'm working on it and the quality of sleep is much higher anyway.

I have stopped taking preventitives. My migraines are reduced at the day before and the first day of my period, but I can control them with zolmitriptan and I can live. 

I am not a medical doctor but I am a scientist and I think the shift with my nutrition, in particular the increased protein intake, has changed my hormonal regulation and the migraines as a result. Obviousy there are other factors (age being the main one) but there is something there.

I am aware I am extremely privileged in being able to afford fresh fruit and veg and cook from scratch every meal for myself and my partner (it does take a lot of time and energy!). I have been poor and I have lived in food deserts where the nearest source of calories was a selection of Cadbury chocolate bars. I can't even imagine how hard that is when you have kids too.

But it can be done, and it is worth trying, to whatever degree one can afford.

As I said, this won't help everyone and it may not help you right now, but it may do at some point, and it may improve other aspects of your life and make the migraines more manageable.

Thank you for reading and good luck with whatever you are trying at the moment!

Green tea contains polyphenols, mainly catechins, which act as powerful antioxidants. They help combat free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, which is linked to premature aging and chronic diseases.

**Support for Cardiovascular Health**  
Studies show that regular consumption of green tea can improve cholesterol metabolism, reduce blood pressure, and enhance heart function.

**Aid in Weight Management**  
The EGCG catechin in green tea boosts metabolism and enhances fat burning, especially when combined with a proper diet and light exercise.

**Enhancement of Memory and Focus**  
Caffeine combined with L-theanine, an amino acid found in green tea, improves concentration, alertness, and mental clarity, without the overstimulation that coffee may cause.

**Cancer Protection**  
Some studies suggest that regular consumption of green tea may reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, thanks to the antioxidant action of catechins and the protection of DNA from damage.",0,1759214530.0,herbs,0,0.5,False

I plan on bringing it up with my GP as soon as I can as I don't really want to try any other stimulant medications because I haven't had any negative side effects apart from recent insomnia. I take my medication every day at 6:30am during work. I should be getting more than enough exercise as I work in a trade where I'm lugging around hundreds of kgs worth of equipment and materials almost every day. I do drink coffee in the mornings (between 6:00am-9:50am) The main problem regarding sleep at the moment is just falling asleep and feeling tired which is something I struggled with a lot, prior to taking medication. Apart from not eating as much as I used to (not a huge decrease) I can't seem to point out what the cause might be and have been looking at medicinal cannabis but as I live in VIC, Australia it is still very much illegal to have THC in your system even if it is prescription (I know you can battle in court against having your drivers license suspended) however from my understanding you still cannot drive between the time you test positive and your court date. Can non THC medicinal cannabis be helpful? If not can anyone offer suggestions/ advice?
Thank you :D

P.S maybe worth mentioning I have also been diagnosed with Autism too but I'm not sure if that might have anything to do with it

I was thinking about making an upgrade to my little coffee corner. I mainly do french press, filter coffee and espresso in my Casabrews CM5418.

Right now I have little Hario hand grinder which is causing me arm pain and also makes difficult grinding for more than one person.

I always read that the best improvement I can make to my coffee setup is a grinder so I think the time has arrived.

My options based on what I've seen:

* DF54
   * Nice option, some people report problems, is the only with flats at this price for what I've seen (I still don't know if is really an advantage in the flats vs conical).
* Fellow Opus
   * Good looking, plastic and lot of retention for what I've seen. But lots of replacements and big community.
* Baratza Encore ESP
   * Big hopper, plastic but nice reviews from people. Maybe a bit noisy. It is the cheapest of these 4 at least in my country.
* Starseeker E55
   * Saw it from time to time suggested as a nice option. I don't know too much about it but it seems a good option. Metal body, conical burrs, but warranty could be also a problem.

Happy to hear some other good recommendations.

1nu61wv,https://i.redd.it/wxo2adawz8sf1.png,"He Gave My Ring to Her, So I Wedded His Rival","After discovering that Kason had been secretly seeing his mistress for three years and was planning to marry her, I decided to leave him and return home for an arranged marriage.

On the first day, I handed the engagement ring he had given me to his mistress.

On the second day, I discarded everything that reminded me of him.

On the third day, I put on my wedding dress and married his arch-rival, Ronan.

From that day forward, Kason and I were no longer connected.

Kason scoffed, thinking I was just throwing a tantrum.

Until he saw the news of my marriage to someone else.

Only then did he panic.

==============================

In the office, the two of them were completely unaware of my presence outside the door.

I poured out the coffee I had made for Kason and left.

Kason had always kissed me with such care, so I had never seen him so passionate before.

Now I knew it was because he had given that side of himself to someone else.

I had thought I could marry for love, but reality had hit me hard.

Numb and disheveled, I wiped away my tears and took a cab back to the mansion.

As soon as I got out of the car, several unfamiliar messages came through.

They were from Ximena.

""You heard it, didn’t you? Mr. Henry is going to give me a wedding even grander than yours.""

Reading those words, my heart still clenched.

He had once said that he would only ever step into a wedding hall with me.

But now, the wedding we had been looking forward to for so long had become a tool to placate his little bird.

Seeing that I hadn’t replied, Ximena sent several more photos.

In them, she and Kason were entwined, their intimacy unmistakable.

""Has he ever loved you like this?""

I gave a bitter smile and didn’t respond.

Instead, I saved the chat history and walked into the mansion.

Less than half an hour after I got home, Kason arrived with a large bouquet of roses.

The roses were fragrant, but I could still detect that unique sweetness on him.

Before, he had only carried my scent.

But now, it was no longer mine.

When I pushed him away, Kason looked momentarily stunned but quickly recovered.

He kissed the corner of my mouth, as if coaxing a child, and spoke softly to me for a long time.

In the past, this was how he would calm me down when he made me angry, and I would always forgive him after just a few words.

But this time, I didn’t want to forgive.

Seeing my lack of response, Kason pulled out a red velvet box from his pocket.

""Luisa, look what this is.""

I opened the box to find the royal diamond ring I had wanted for so long.

Back then, Kason had felt guilty for not being able to buy it for me.

But now, seeing the hidden guilt in his eyes, I knew it was just a bribe after his betrayal.

Remembering the promises Kason had made to me, I instinctively looked at him.

""Luisa, I’ve finally given it to you, this ring that belongs only to you.""

""From now on, it’s just you and me, forever.""

My fingers traced the ring, but my heart felt as if it were being torn apart.

Kason, you still remember the promises you made back then, so how could you change your heart now?

With a bitter smile, I took off the ring, but Kason grabbed my hand, his voice urgent.

""Luisa, what are you doing?""

""Don’t you like it anymore?""

A flash of panic crossed Kason’s eyes, but I hid my feelings and spoke calmly.

""Rings are most meaningful when given on the wedding day.""

I saw Kason visibly relax, but my heart ached unbearably.

Once, I had hoped to grow old with you, to spend our lives together.

But now, Kason, we have no future.

He put the ring away, slapping his forehead in frustration.

""It’s my fault for being so impatient, Luisa.""

""But the thought of finally being able to marry you makes me so eager.""

Kason grew more and more excited as he spoke, and in the past, I would have been moved to tears.

But now, I just looked at him calmly, my face expressionless.

Seeing my calm demeanor, a flicker of guilt passed through his eyes, and he was about to say something.

But then his phone lit up, and Kason’s face darkened, only to turn excited the moment he saw the message.

He scrolled through the screen, his Adam’s apple bobbing, a flash of desire in his eyes.

Then he turned off the screen and sighed, feigning regret.

""Luisa, I’m sorry, but something’s come up at the office. I have to go.""

Before I could respond, Kason rushed out, not even grabbing his coat.

I still called out to him, ""Is it really something important?""

He froze at my words, then smiled and said, ""Of course it is. Why would I lie to you? Wait for me, I’ll be back.""

Then he turned and left without hesitation.

I knew he was going to see Ximena.

And I knew he wouldn’t be coming back tonight.

Looking at the empty room, I suddenly laughed.

I had once told him that if he lied to me and I found out, I would leave his world forever.

Kason, since you lied to me.

It’s become this mix of nostalgia and flexing, like, “look what I’ve lived through.”

Ready to go off at a moments notice.


I tiptoe around it,
praying it won't see me,

No Baseline!","Hey everyone, 38M and I’ve been in deep ketosis for about 5 months, lost about 16kg from 84kg to 68kg currently and just got my first bloodwork since starting. 

I don’t have pre-keto numbers to compare to, so I’m not sure how to interpret these results.

The only markers that came back slightly above reference range were:
	•	LDL-C: 2.9 mmol/L (reference: < 2.5)
	•	ApoB: 1.22 g/L (reference: 0.48–1.1)

Since I didn’t get a baseline before keto, I’m trying to work out if these numbers are something to tweak, track over time, or not stress about.

Anyone else seen similar changes after going keto? Would love to hear how others handled LDL/ApoB increases without pre-keto labs for comparison.

Recently, she mentioned she’s going to a gala with a friend, S. He’s a wealthy client she met about a year ago, and they became friends professionally. She introduced me to him once, and he seems like a genuinely good person. He invited her as his “date” to this gala, and my wife said it’s fine.

I fully trust her, and I know that interacting socially with clients is part of her job. But I can’t help feeling a bit uncomfortable about her attending as someone’s “date.” I don’t want to stop her or come off as controlling, because I know she’s completely trustworthy and this is a professional relationship.

* Minis (new/used): $150; $300 after 10 units (retro) 

Misc:

* I'm closing in on 2 years exp. in sales. Averaging \~16 cars/mo this year; averaged 18.5/mo last year
* If sold at MSRP, most new cars are minis due to high pack, unless there's a trade and we UA it

  
Here's the real kick in the nuts though: **Everything I just listed can be negated by one ""bad"" (read: less than 9/10 rating) survey.** Backend goes away, as does the double minis. OEM spiff money stays, oddly enough. Current month is a case in point. Am in strong position to lead the board with 20+ cars. However, because of a single 8 survey, I'm going all the way back to $150 minis with no backend.

Bottom line: I'm tired. A lot. I of course recognize that this is a tough, draining industry. I get that a bad survey can/should impact OEM bonus money. But tying it directly to the payplan like this is just not sustainable in the longterm. I can't keep churning out 17-20 car months with good backend numbers, only to see it go poof at least 25% of the time because somebody rated an 8 because the coffee was subpar, or there was a line to see Finance. (seriously, they did)

So questions are:

1. Surveys aside, is this pay plan actually good?  
2. Would you be frustrated to some degree too? Or am I just overreacting?

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",1,1759213390.0,askcarsales,2,1.0,False

The smooth brass surface catches soft light, tracing every delicate line of the sparrow: its wings slightly lifted, as if mid-twirl, each curve bearing the warmth of artisanal work. No loud flair, just quiet charm-like a secret touch of nature's grace tucked into your space.
Perch it on your coffee table, nestle it on a bookshelf, or let it brighten your desk-suddenly, your nook feels softer, more curated, full of that ""quiet luxury"" vibe we all love.

1nu5p3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/olfactivechemistry/comments/1nu5p3m/the_global_superpowers_of_the_18th_century_were/,"The global superpowers of the 18th century were literally hunting for whale vomit and deer gland secretions. The ""Age of Discovery"" was partly driven by the quest for perfumes.","
TL;DR: The map of the world was partly drawn by the demand for whale vomit, deer gland secretions, and cat butt goop. The history of exploration has a hidden, deeply funky scent trail.


We think of the Age of Exploration as a quest for gold, spices, and silk. But we're missing a huge, smelly part of the story: the desperate, often brutal hunt for raw materials for perfume.

Before we could synthesize smells in a lab, if you wanted a scent to last, you needed ""fixatives."" And the best ones came from the most disgusting places. We went to the ends of the earth—and nearly drove species to extinction—for these olfactory goldmines.

Exhibit A: Ambergris - ""Floating Gold""

· What it is: A waxy, rock-like substance formed in the intestines of a sperm whale (it's basically a gallstone for squid beaks). It's found floating in the sea or washed up on beaches.
· Why it was wanted: In its aged form, it doesn't smell like poop; it develops a sublime, marine, animalic scent that makes perfume notes ""stick"" to the skin for much longer. It was worth its weight in actual gold. Kings and nobles would pay fortunes for it.
· The Impact: Whaling ships, sponsored by European powers, weren't just hunting whales for oil. They were also on the lookout for this precious intestinal treasure. A single lump of ambergris could make an entire voyage profitable, fueling the expansion of the global whaling industry from the Arctic to the South Pacific.

Exhibit B: Musk - The Scent of Death

· What it is: A reddish, paste-like secretion from a gland in the abdomen of the male Musk Deer, a small deer native to Asia.
· Why it was wanted: Its scent is intensely animalic, sensual, and tenacious. It was the ultimate base note, giving perfumes a warm, skin-like quality. It was also used in medicines.
· The Impact: To get just one pound of musk, you had to kill 30-50 deer. This created a massive, bloody trade network stretching from the Himalayas, through the Silk Road, and into the Middle East and Europe. The Musk Deer was hunted so relentlessly it was nearly wiped out and remains endangered today. The demand for musk literally shaped overland trade for centuries.

Exhibit C: Civet - The Cat Coffee Bean

· What it is: A paste scraped from the anal glands of the Civet Cat.
· Why it was wanted: Like musk, it's intensely fecal in its pure form but becomes floral and alluring when diluted. It was a crucial ingredient for adding depth and animalic warmth.
· The Impact: Sourced primarily from Ethiopia, the civet trade became a key part of East African commerce with the Arab world and later, European colonial powers.

So, what's the big picture?

The desire for a long-lasting perfume directly led to:

· Expanded Whaling: Pushing fleets into uncharted oceans.
· The Exploitation of the ""New World"": Colonial powers were constantly looking for new sources of aromatic materials.
· The Near-Extinction of Species: The Musk Deer is the classic example.
· The Rise of Synthetic Chemistry: The scarcity and brutality of the animal trade directly motivated chemists in the 19th century to create synthetic alternatives, which completely revolutionized perfumery.
