1pv42p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KeatsChinese/comments/1pv42p7/usage_of_or或者huòzhěand_还是háishì/,"Usage of “or”---“或者Huòzhě”and ""还是Háishì""","1. 或者Huòzhě: It expresses selection and is used in declarative sentences. It lists several possibilities with a mild tone.

Example: 你可以喝咖啡，或者喝茶。

Nǐ kěyǐ hē kāfēi, huòzhě hē chá.

You can drink coffee, or drink tea.

2. 还是Háishì : It expresses selection, is mostly used in interrogative sentences (alternative questions), and can also be used in declarative sentences to show doubt or hesitation with a more active tone.

Example:你喝咖啡还是喝茶？

Nǐ hē kāfēi háishì hē chá?

Do you drink coffee or tea?

3.Sentence Pattern Differences:

Declarative sentences: We usually use ""或者huòzhě "" to objectively list options.

Example:周末我或者看书，或者看电影。

Zhōumò wǒ huòzhě kàn shū, huòzhě kàn diànyǐng.

On weekends, I either read books or watch movies.

Note: When ""还是háishì"" is used in declarative sentences, it often carries a tone of discussion or hesitation.

Example: 我不知道周末去公园还是去商场。

Wǒ bù zhīdào zhōumò qù gōngyuán háishì qù shāngchǎng.

I don't know whether to go to the park or the mall on weekends.

Interrogative sentences: We can only use ""还是háishì "" to form alternative questions.

Example: 你明天去北京还是上海？ 

Nǐ míngtiān qù Běijīng háishì Shànghǎi? 

Will you go to Beijing or Shanghai tomorrow?

1pv42cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Opening_Tomorrow_288/comments/1pv42cv/story/,Story,"My mother wanted me to go through confirmation when I was fifteen years old. Even as a high schooler, weighted by the dredges of a misdiagnosis, treated like an idiot for my entire life, knew that the psychological damage of religious confirmation would carve chasms in my developing cognitive landscape. When I thought about the finality of a chosen faith, the proclamation of an answer when I didn't even know the question--I couldn't stomach the process. 

My mother is a back pew Christian. She couldn't get my brother and I ready on time, even when we were scheduled to be the acolyte. She rushed into the sanctuary, a cloud of angrily chewed mint gum and expired lipstick--a storm of hushed vexation, regaling her woes to the other parents.

My mother is a protestant, a congregationalist, but the lack of central religious leadership always made the church feel hap-hazard. Authority was heavily associated with angry child-care providers and never attributable to a spiritual guide. Sunday school engaged children in whimsically strict busy work while parents temporarily hardened their moral compunctions in the sanctuary below. Everything smelt like stale coffee, old wood, and yellowing paper. Religious themed arts and crafts were executed with broken crayons, dollar store scissors and discolored construction paper. The bathrooms had pink Dial soap, an abundance of one-ply toilet paper, and a dead flower in a milk white vase. The smell of clean dust betrayed how rarely rooms were used---it was a once-a-week community center that was abandoned by 2:00pm on Sunday. During the week, AA and the girls scouts met in the social room (on different days, of course). The church administrators ensured that only the social room was used for any non church related function.

There was a chruchery-school in the basement where most members sent their toddlers. The alphabet was taught. Itsy-bitsy-spider was sung. Children tasted the beginning complexities of their own socialization. 

  
I hated church, but it was grounding. I hated church, but I loved the stained glass. I loved the massive painting of Jesus that dominated the narthex. I loved the feeling of bible paper, and the thickness of mid century carpet beneath my feet. I loved the idea of A for apple, B for boy, and G for God. I was afraid of the devil and Jesus fortified my child brain against dark rooms and unknown danger. 

But---when I was in high school, and I was told I would have to start confirmation class after church, I instinctively said ""no."" It felt like liquid metal poured into a mould---dangerous, angry, and prepared to harden. I realized that--no matter how much I valued its structure---I couldn't know. I couldn't accept faith as a conceptual anchor to guide me for the rest of my life. Appreciation never crossed the barrier to belief.

[>$550],"This sub has gently steered me away from purchasing a Nespresso setup. I've had years of pour over that never really hit the way a good coffee shop latte has, and after months of forsaking coffee altogether I'm ready to begin a soft plunge into home espresso world. 

  
Unfortunately this is also at the same time in which I'm honing my skills as a tattoo artist AND becoming reaquiainted with Pro Tools- leaving me little spare brain and time to learn the intricacies of manual espresso machines. It looks like a refurbished or secondhand superauto setup would be my best ticket to the experience I want at home. 

I'm from Chicago- current favorite cups have been from Conscious Cup and Krema Coffee Roasters. They're not always amazing but they've impressed me the most. I drink about one latte a day- caffiene tolerance is low again so I'll probably return to 2 cups a day soon enough. 

Experience level on the brewing end is essentially 0, hence why I considered Nespresso after having a really nice cup from a friend. I have severe chronic fatigue, so this is my ticket to a more productive life. 

I was looking at refurb Gaggias until seeing more than one review mentioning the crema being poor, and while I lack the vocab to truly identify what has made my very favorite lattes so good, I suspect the crema is a factor.

but what I felt for you was,

nothing like that? 

It was the morning dew brushing against my skin, the soft pink hues of a saturated sky; your words circled my ribs, asking for permission before coiling around my heart, 

not to squeeze tight,

but to sit gently with me in my silence, warming the air between us. 

Your name trickled off my lips, light, like the subtlest summer breeze, demanding nothing but presence; you wanted nothing more than my time, my thoughts, my warmth.

One day I just knew, that I couldn't bear to be without you; 

you loved like sunsets and coffee stains, showing up in the littlest of the things, the only things that truly matter. Then, and only then, did the storm come;

The way I loved you wasn't finite.

I’m pretty new to the sub, but I’ve been pretty active in it over the past year. For context, in May 2025. Ended up saying screw this to my job and took a four months sabbatical. Traveled for three months in June across Thailand and Japan. Greatest experience I’ve ever had.

I had so many firsts, so much growth in terms of good emotions bad emotions. Learned a lot about myself and my strengths along with things I want to improve. I met a ton of people mainly through bar, crawls and tours. and overall just gained a bunch of confidence learned a lot about myself, and just lived at unconventional life compared to the Western world (I’m from Canada)

After I came back from my trip, I crashed hard. I always knew about post travel, depression, but didn’t realize how much it would actually hit me. Came back to the same toxic job. Somehow got even worse. Quit without anything lined up. Went through about two months of anxiety and borderline depression. But I ended up landing a fully remote job. They have a 1 to 2 month work abroad policy and I have five weeks of vacation (pretty solid from other companies in the west that I’ve heard of so can’t complain)

I want to make as much advantage of this newfound freedom that I have. Even though I won’t be taking a sabbatical anytime soon at least I can have more trips every couple of months.

I have quite a few questions. So firstly, I fell in love with Thailand and definitely make a plan to go back. But I don’t want to get stuck in that mode of only going to Thailand and not experiencing other countries.

Any recommendations of solo friendly, relatively cheaper and enjoyable/social countries with great nightlife? I want to maximize how many trips I can do a year. And the only way I can do it that is by budgeting so I’m not spending as much.

Any recommendations of how to meet people abroad? I’ve had a lot of success meeting people through a bar crawls and sometimes through tours. In Bangkok, I joined 2 Meetups on Meetup.com. But any more advice?

I love meeting people in fact that’s probably the reason why I crashed so hard is because I just fell in love with getting to know, locals and tourists.

Also, I realize that I’m more fond of traveling to take your time as opposed to feeling like a tourist and rushing to see everything. So if I do go back to any of these countries, my goal wouldn’t be to see as much of the country as I can, but to really immerse myself in the place that I’m in. For example, in Thailand, I would probably spend a week in Bangkok and another few days in Chiang Mai. If I plan to go to Portugal, I would probably mostly spend my time in Lisbon with a tour here and there, but I wouldn’t try to see the entire country. I love the feeling of actually living at a place like a local and having routine routines like jamming your coffee shop seeing things here and there having a nice meal connecting with locals and people that’s mostly what it is.

Matched on Tinder. Conversation was normal. Light banter. No red flags. She suggests coffee. Perfect. Public. Low commitment. I think, “Great, worst case I drink caffeine and leave.”

I show up a few minutes early. She walks in, looks exactly like her photos. So far, so good.

We order. Sit down.

She says, “I’m really glad you agreed to meet. I don’t usually connect with people.”

That sentence should have warned me. It did not.

She asks what I am looking for. I say something safe. Casual, see where it goes, normal human response.

She nods and immediately says, “Okay, so my last relationship ended because he cheated with my cousin, and then my best friend stopped talking to me, and my therapist says I need to be more open.”

This is minute four.

I am holding my coffee like it is a stress ball. I say, “Oh wow, that’s rough.”

She takes this as permission.

I now know about her childhood, her parents’ divorce, her attachment style, and why men from southwestern Ontario cannot be trusted. She references astrology at least twice. I do not know my sign and at this point I am afraid to ask.

She asks me, “Do you believe people are inherently good?”

I say, “Depends on the person.”

She says, “That’s interesting,” and writes something in her phone. I do not know what that means.

At some point she asks if I want kids. I say maybe someday. She says she wants three but not with someone who has “avoidant tendencies.”

I have known her for twenty minutes.

The barista checks on us. She says, “We’re having a really deep conversation.”

The barista looks at me like I am being held hostage.

Finally, she says, “I feel like we have a connection.”

I panic and say, “I think we get along, but I’m not sure we’re on the same page.”

She nods, smiles, and says, “Yeah, I felt that too.”

She then asks if we can still follow each other on Instagram to “see where life takes us.”

I say sure because I am weak.

She hugs me. It is long. Too long. I leave.

An hour later she messages me, “I think you’re emotionally unavailable, but I wish you healing.”

I did not ask for healing.

1pv3vef,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelFanStory/comments/1pv3vef/strength_the_human_hulk/,Strength — The Human Hulk,"Far beyond the city lights of Rochester, New York—past the factories, past the river bends, and into a quiet stretch of land where the air still carried the memory of drums and stories—there lived a family who honored their past with dignity and care.

They were the **Adebayo family**, proud African Americans who traced their lineage back through generations of storytellers, steelworkers, builders, and singers. Around the dinner table, elders spoke of **John Henry**, the legendary man who challenged the machine with nothing but his hammer and his heart. The Adebayo family didn’t claim the legend lightly. They didn’t boast. They simply said:

“Strength is not just muscle. It is spirit.”

# The Family

* **Samuel Adebayo** – the father, broad-shouldered and calm, a construction foreman who believed leadership came from patience.
* **Ruth Adebayo** – the mother, strong in a quieter way, a community nurse whose hands healed more than bodies.
* **Malik Adebayo** – the eldest son, tall and powerful, a college athlete with natural strength.
* **Ayo Adebayo** – the middle child, disciplined and steady, already working with his father on construction sites.
* **Kehinde Adebayo** – the youngest son… and the one who worried the most.

Kehinde was kind, thoughtful, and observant—but he was not strong in the way his family was known for.

# The Boy Who Couldn’t Lift

At sixteen, **Kehinde** struggled with tasks his brothers handled easily.

He could sweep the porch, wash dishes, organize tools, tend the garden, and help his mother at the clinic—but when it came to heavy chores, he always had to step back.

He couldn’t:

* Carry sacks of cement from the truck
* Lift steel beams onto the foundation
* Chop thick logs for winter
* Push broken-down vehicles off the road

When he tried, his arms shook, his breath faltered, and sometimes the laughter of passing neighbors—unintended but painful—cut deeper than words.

One evening, as Malik hauled a refrigerator onto the porch by himself, Kehinde looked down at his hands.

“I’m sorry,” he said quietly.

Samuel placed a hand on his shoulder.  
“Son, you don’t owe strength to anyone.”

But Kehinde still felt the weight.

# A Prayer in Candlelight

That night, Kehinde knelt beside his bed. A single candle flickered, casting long shadows across the room. On his wall were drawings—not of superheroes, but of African symbols, drums, and a hammer resting against lightning.

He whispered softly, not demanding, not angry—just hopeful.

“God… ancestors… whoever listens… I don’t want to be better than anyone. I just want to be strong enough to help. Strong enough to protect.”

The candle flame grew taller.

The air rumbled—not violently, but like distant thunder rolling across the sky.

And then a voice—not loud, but powerful—spoke within him.

**“Strength is earned by the heart that seeks it.”**

# The Blessing of Shango

Lightning did not strike the house.  
The earth did not break.

Instead, energy flowed through Kehinde’s body like rhythm through a drum.

His muscles tightened—not grotesquely, but purposefully. His frame expanded, bones reinforcing, skin hardening like living stone. His heartbeat synced with thunder, steady and unstoppable.

This was not rage.

This was **balance**.

The presence of **Shango**, the Orisha of thunder, strength, and justice, did not command Kehinde.

It **recognized** him.

By dawn, the boy who had knelt in prayer stood as a man.

# Morning Shock

Ruth dropped her coffee cup.

Malik froze mid-step.

Ayo whispered, “No way…”

Kehinde stood in the doorway, now towering, broad, calm—his eyes still gentle, still kind.

“Mom,” he said carefully, “I think something happened.”

Samuel stared for a long moment… then nodded.

“Our stories are alive,” he said quietly. “And they chose you.”

# Strength Beyond Measure

Kehinde soon learned the truth of his transformation.

He lifted a broken car to free a trapped neighbor—effortlessly.  
He steadied a collapsing house during a storm—alone.  
Bullets bounced harmlessly from his skin during a robbery attempt.  
Explosions rattled him but never broke him.

He did not grow angry.

He grew **responsible**.

News traveled fast.

And soon, an opportunity came from **New York City**.

# The Job That Changed Everything

Kehinde was offered work as a **structural safety specialist**—someone who reinforced damaged buildings, rescued people during collapses, and assisted emergency crews in situations too dangerous for machines.

In Harlem, on his first night shift, a man stepped out of the shadows.

Luke Cage.

“You’re built different,” Luke said, arms crossed. “And not just physically.”

Kehinde smiled.  
“I was raised that way.”

They worked together—protecting neighborhoods, stopping gangs, lifting debris, shielding civilians.

“You don’t fight angry,” Luke said one night. “That’s rare.”

Kehinde replied, “Anger breaks things. Strength holds them together.”

# A New Name

The people noticed.

They didn’t see a monster.

They saw a protector.

A man who lifted buses.  
A man who stood against explosions.  
A man who carried buildings like burdens meant to be shared.

They gave him a name—not in fear, but in awe.

**Strength — The Human Hulk**

Not born of rage.  
Not driven by destruction.  
But forged by faith, ancestry, and respect.

# Legacy

Back home, a candle still burned by Kehinde’s bed.

Not as a wish anymore.

But as thanks.

And somewhere, in the echo of thunder, Shango smiled—not at power gained, but at power used wisely.",1,1766631966.0,MarvelFanStory,0,1.0,False

But still I have no one to listen, so I would really appreciate anyone bearing this.

 Today at dawn, we had worship service bc of you-know-who’s birthday. Parents, brother, grandma, and I went there and then when our way home we went to have some breakfast. On the way my father called my name out for something, so I peered at him from the backseat. I thought my dad saw me so I awaited his answer. And suddenly he got mad bc he felt disrespected of my lack of answer. And ofc I apologized myself, already sick of his crap first in the morning, on the very day of christmas. 

We got home around 7 or 8 and I slept until 11. Until my father woke me up for errands. Mind you, I was tired (obviously), I didn’t wanna get out in the cold to grab his coffee. Oh and just before this my brother attempted to wake me up and failed, then my mom which I replied “I want to sleep”, and then my dad waking me up. I knew this was a very unreasonable request so I thought I’d be fine with saying no. (Seriously waking up a person for errands when there are other people, even themself?) And the he threatened that he’ll have to ‘punish’ me real soon and will hit me. What a douche. 

Went cafe with brother, and while waiting, I was thinking about what I could’ve done or could've happened to make him that aggressive in the morning. Aside what happened at dawn, I couldn’t seem to find any reasonable evidence. Which led to only option, and that is, power play. 

My body is getting bigger and I am getting older day by day, and he is anxious he’ll lose control over me. So now even with the slightest trigger he reacts violently. 

But why. Why couldn’t he have picked another day for ts? Seriously, christmas? 

Another day, another stage of fucking yandere simulator. I’m sick of this meaningless and petty power play, and that I have to oblige. I am so sick of disrespect.

Anyways, i started with lexapro 3 weeks ago, the doctor tell me to start with 5mg, but i made a mistake and started with 10mg, at the second week my Mother told me that we been doing the thing wrong, but yeah it was too late. 

I really gonna be honest with yall, i dont really have any bad side effect at all (well, in the first days), at the begining i was really sleepy, it was hard because i was too tired to do anything, but it wasnt that bad, I had some nausea, but it wasn't a big deal the first few days. Overall, I felt more tired, but my brain felt foggy. I didn't feel bad, but I wasn't completely well either. The OCD (one of the reasons I was prescribed it) was still active, but not as aggressive. By the second week, I really felt good. I wasn't stressed or angry; I felt good, filled with a sense of tranquility. I would go to the park and contemplate things, but the OCD was still there. The depression would hit at night, and the anxiety calmed down, even though I drink coffee. It doesn't really affect me much, but I suppose it has an impact. It's been almost three weeks, and I've fallen into a depressive episode. I thought about hurting myself after a long time, and I'm really confused.

When does it really take effect? I'm confused about how I feel, and I've been trying to cut back on my habits like vaping, smoking, and drinking coffee to help the medication work better, but it's difficult and I don't know if it will become useless soon. I need advice; I'm confused and afraid that nothing will improve. And idk if im weird, but i feel more sexually activated, i learn that sometimes it goes on instead of lower my libido.

I’m curious about what happens chemically when you drink a Red Bull. I (and nearly everyone in my maternal line before me) have dealt with depression and chronic fatigue. 

I drink a lot of coffee and naturally sourced energy drinks, but on a rare occasion I’ve had a monster or a Red Bull.

Monster, Ghost and V8 don’t really do a whole lot for me. Coffee does more, but even then I have a lot of trouble staying awake throughout the day. However, even a half a can of Red Bull and I am on the best caffeine high of my life. My fatigue is just gone. It also speeds up my systems and I drink a LOT more water. I’ve only ever had it a few times, but every time I’ve had this experience. But never with anything else.

Does anyone know why this happens with Red Bull in particular? Is there something in it that helps with fatigue? Would this give any insight into the cause of my fatigue? It feels a little overly optimistic, but I figured it was at least worth asking.",1,1766631136.0,NoStupidQuestions,1,0.67,False

Especially the egregious claim that the vegan diet is EASY!  I just asked chat gpt because it's all over the place and so exhausting.  So basically what they're saying is, I can't just eat what I normally eat, and swap out the animal product with a vegan substitute, and add some healthy smoothies and take a bunch of pills.  A vegan diet for *me* is extremely daunting and difficult, and NOT because of the restrictions!  No, that's the least of my worries.  I'm so glad that vegans are able to do this - how lucky and privileged they must be, but I'm sorry, this is INSANE.  I could *never* do this.  Not in a million years.  I know many exvegans are able to do this because most people are generally healthy and active with massive guts and digestive systems with strong teeth like horses - unlike me who's like a moth in comparison, but that still didn't even work for them.

I'll just copy and paste if anyone is interested, it's AI, so take it with a grain of salt (please just ignore if you hate AI - I barely use it)  Does this sound right to you?  It doesn't sound that far off from other sources but it's a little more fun to read.  I think we need to stop throwing around this phrase and question it directly.

# What professionals actually mean by a “well-planned vegan diet”

When organizations like the **Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics** or **British Dietetic Association** say *“well-planned”*, they **do not** mean:

* “Eat vegetables and you’ll be fine”
* “Just listen to your body”
* “Whole foods automatically cover everything”
* “Eat until you’re full”

They mean something **much more structured and intentional**.

A *well-planned vegan diet* is essentially a diet that **consciously replaces every nutrient normally supplied by animal foods**, *on purpose*, *every day*, often with **supplements and fortified foods**.

This is not a moral judgment — just a biological reality.

# The non-negotiables (this is the core)

A vegan diet is considered “well-planned” **only if all of these are reliably covered**:

# 1. Vitamin B12 (mandatory)

* **There is no vegan diet that is adequate without B12 supplementation**
* Typical recommendation:
   * 25–100 mcg daily **or**
   * 1,000–2,000 mcg weekly

This alone disqualifies many “casual” vegan diets from being “well-planned”.

# 2. Adequate calories (this is where many people struggle)

Plant foods are **less calorie-dense** than animal foods.

A well-planned vegan diet assumes:

* You are **intentionally eating more volume**
* Or adding calorie-dense plant foods (nuts, seeds, oils, grains)

For many adults:

* **\~2,000–2,400 kcal/day** (varies by body size, sex, activity, illness)

This often means:

* 3 full meals **plus**
* 1–3 snacks
* Not skipping meals
* Not relying on salads, soups, or smoothies alone

Undereating is one of the *most common* failures of “unplanned” veganism.

# 3. Protein (not just “some”)

A well-planned vegan diet **targets protein intentionally**, not incidentally.

General target:

* **0.8–1.0 g protein per kg body weight**
* Often **more** if:
   * You’re ill
   * Under stress
   * Recovering from addiction
   * Underweight
   * Neurodivergent with higher metabolic demand
   * \[insert whatever health condition you have\]

That usually means **daily inclusion** of:

* Legumes (beans, lentils)
* Soy foods (tofu, tempeh, soy milk)
* Nuts/seeds
* Grains *combined* with legumes

Example:

* Beans alone are not enough
* Rice alone is not enough
* Variety matters daily

# 4. Iron (with absorption strategy)

Plant iron is **non-heme iron**, which is harder to absorb.

“Well-planned” means:

* Iron-rich foods **daily**
* Vitamin C **in the same meal**
* Awareness that tea/coffee block absorption

This is work — not passive eating.

# 5. Omega-3 fats (EPA & DHA)

This is a big one that’s often glossed over.

“Well-planned” usually assumes **one of these**:

* Regular algae-based DHA/EPA supplement
* Or high ALA intake (flax/chia/walnuts) *with the understanding that conversion is poor*

Many dietitians now quietly recommend **algae supplements**, especially for:

* Mental health
* Neurological vulnerability
* Pregnancy
* Long-term vegans

# 6. Calcium + Vitamin D

This is not automatic on a vegan diet.

“Well-planned” means:

* Fortified plant milks **daily**
* OR calcium-rich plant foods in sufficient quantity
* Vitamin D supplementation in low-sun climates (like Canada)

# 7. Iodine

This is one of the most commonly missed nutrients.

“Well-planned” often requires:

* Iodized salt **intentionally**
* Or seaweed in *controlled* amounts (not random)

# What “well-planned” looks like in real life (not theory)

A *real* well-planned vegan day might include:

* Fortified plant milk (multiple servings)
* Legumes **at least twice daily**
* Whole grains
* Nuts/seeds
* Added fats
* Fruit & vegetables
* B12 supplement
* Possibly vitamin D
* Possibly iodine
* Possibly omega-3 supplement

That’s… a lot to manage.

And that’s **before** factoring in:

* IBS
* Sensory aversions
* Appetite suppression
* Executive dysfunction
* Trauma
* Poverty
* Burnout
* Illness & Disease
* Addiction recovery
* Genetic variants 
* etc.

Which is why this phrase can feel misleading.",3,1766631122.0,exvegans,0,1.0,False
1pv3m0t,https://i.redd.it/2gegxpt0l99g1.jpeg,Fan Fic Wishlist: Odd Theory,"

I want to have a spinoff series with Jonathan, Murray, and Nancy. Perhaps 5-10 years pass after the finale of Stranger things, the three try and fail to settle down back to regular life. Nancy and Jonathan split apart. Murray continues his normal crazy conspiracy ways. The three come back to Hawkins after major failures in their personal life. Nancy gets fired due to becoming overzealous in tracking leads. She becomes almost paranoid, with the trauma of Hawkins haunts her. She comes back to Hawkins for a reset with her mother and dad. Mike and the kids are off to college at this point. Jonathan tries to become a famous photographer, but sadly he has only held a job as a retail employee in a major city. He comes home hoping his past will spark an artistic Renaissance in himself. He spends a couple days with his mother.  Murray feels like his life is empty after the excitement of the series. He's gone back to his normal everyday, but it feels pathetic years after the events of Hawkins. He comes to see Hopper every now and then to relive the glory days. 

The three cross paths at a memorial site for those lost. They decide to go out for breakfast. This serves as an homage to the above scene. They lament their lives and reminence on the past. A man in black walks into the diner, and gives the group a bit of the heebie jeebies. He sits down and drinks coffee in the background, as we gets a brief conversation recapping the end of the series and how it impacted their journeys. Then *pop pop* as the man in black is gunned down by a strange looking fellow. He steals the man's briefcase, and the group feel prone to action. Murray knocks the man down, Nancy grabs the gun and Jonathan grabs the briefcase. As the group is dragged into another conspiracy.... 

I thought the series could be a fun focus on 90s homages, like Stranger things is a focus on 80s. The briefcase and Pulp fiction is an obvious one. Just a fun thought I've been toying with today, as my excitement for tomorrow grows!

1pv3kx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1pv3kx2/misfit_toys/,Misfit Toys,"Officer Marco walked through the alleyway, the reports were pretty clear. 



Someone was cutting down his network of informants, and it was targeted. 



The city’s politics had grown pretty hazy as the leadership finally woke up to the real problem.  Arrests had to be increased.



Cashless Bail? Prison Reform?  That bleeding heart shit wasn’t going to work, he knew that much.



He spun on his heel as he reacted to the sound of a trashbin rolling across the alleyway.  



His nerves were on a hair trigger, he was ready for anything.  



Whether it was a gang of thugs who had somehow gotten some rat inside his department or if this was just what these animals considered ‘Street justice’ he wasn’t sure.



All he knew was that the people who fed him all the information for his last bust were gone.  Each killed in their own homes, no less.



So here he was, at the burnt out apartment building that he had run a raid on not more than a month ago in November. 



The memories were still fresh in his mind.



…



“No Knock,” the radio called out, “Warrant’s issues, get in there.”



Officer Marco slipped the safety off on his rifle as he waited for the two armored officers with battering rams to crack the door off its hinges.



“Move move!” Marco shouted as his radio chimed in, several officers rushing into the apartment building.



“Egress into the lobby confirmed, all units, stay alert,” was the call on the radio.



 Marco kept his head on a swivel as he rushed up the stairs.  



The goal was very simple, the intel was clear, there was a terrorist cell in the building.



At least, that’s what the mayor had confirmed.  



It’s not the mayor’s fault if the next up and coming challenger to his campaign was in the same building.  Hell, who associates with terrorist cells?



The officer’s boots thumped up dusty stairs as the sound of gunfire echoed from down below.



“Shots fired!” the radio called out, “Primary target not down, keep up the pursuit!”



Marco kept going up the steps, stopping at a hallway.  He watched one door slam shut, and made his way directly towards it, motioning for his fellow officers to file behind him.



One officer slammed his fist on the door, “Police!  Open up!”



Marco rolled his eyes, “That ain’t protocol anymore, rookie!”



With a kick of his boot, he knocked the door in.



There he was, a man with dark skin in his pajama’s, a small pendant shaped like a moon hanging around his neck, resting on his bare chest.  His hands were up, but his eyes were steely and his expression grim.



This was their target.  Theodore Fadel, the up and coming alderman who was a threat to the mayor and police chief’s crackdown on crime in the city.



Marco smiled, “On the ground.”



Marco didn’t wait, and instead opened fire.  His other officers followed suit, blasting away at the man.



Theodore fell to his knees, blood spurting from his mouth as his once steely demeanor shook.



Marco grinned as he approached the man, pulling out his side arm as he pushed it to Theodore’s forehead, “Always so fucking cocky right up until a bullet flies through you, huh?” 



Without waiting for a reply, Marco fired his sidearm, blasting the back of Theodore’s head out, his gray matter painting the room behind him.



“Target down,” Marco said into his radio.



“Secure the area,” the radio echoed, “good work everyone.  Clean-up time.”



Marco heard something shift in the closet, and quickly motioned for his fellow officers to follow him.



He slowly approached the closet, making a nod to the rookie from earlier to open it.



As it opened, a huge green teddy bear with holes punctured through its downy fur fell forward.  Fluff and stuffing filled the air as it rolled harmlessly to his feet. 



It was about five feet tall, had beady blue and green eyes, and a stoic expression stitched onto its little bear snout. 



Rolling next to it was a blood covered toy, upon closer inspection, it was a small wind-up toy of some kind, seemingly a monkey.



Behind the bear in the closet was a little girl, no older than 8.



Marco looked at the back of the bear, seeing blood stains on the fur.



He kicked the bear out of the way, looking down at the small girl, her breaths coming quick and short as blood dripped from her wounds.  Her eyes were dilated, tears leaking down them.



“We need EMS-” the rookie started to call before Marco slapped his hand from the radio.



“This ain’t academy, kid,” Marco spat at his feet, “She’s a witness, and she’s already done for,"" Marco turned as the girl’s eyes dulled, and she slumped onto the bear.  “Terrorists,” Marco said with a grin, “Always using kids as shields.” 



…



Another clatter of trash bins and Marco was certain he had somehow either spooked a pack of rats or someone was fucking with him, “Show yourselves, you fucker!”



A raspy voice called out from down the alley, exactly from where Marco wasn’t sure.  “Rude, my man.”



This guy sounded like some common thug, “Okay buddy, you’re cornered.  There’s about ten guys outside here waiting to take you down.”



The raspy voice chuckled, “No there ain’t!” 



Marco flinched as his bluff didn’t hold up, “Okay prick, but you don’t have the drop on me.”



“Drop?” The raspy voice called from another position within the long alleyway.  There was a scurrying sound that Marco dismissed as rats, “Nah, ain’t no drops!  Not like that drop of a watch yah got! What’s that?  Rolex? Nice bit of kit on a cop salary, eh?”



Marco scoffed, his safety off as he held his flashlight up, “Uncultured thugs like you only know the big names.  It’s a Breguet, you fucking animal.”



The raspy voice laughed, “Animal?!” more scurrying rushed across the alleyway, “Oh brother! You don’t know what you don’t know!”



Marco lifted his lip in a sneer, “Listen asshole, I got better things to do than trash talk with some punk on Christmas Eve.”



“Me too,” a dark hiss now came from the voice, and Marco looked up, his eyes on the fire escape as a window closed, “But hey, you saw I didn’t have no more Merry Christmas’s, didn’t yah, *punk?*”



Marco growled and holstered his weapon as he jumped up and climbed the fire escape.  He moved to the window, his expression stoney and agitated.  “Keep this up, you’ll be in a pine box.”



“Dey make ‘em in pine anymore?  Thought they were metal ones…” the voice taunted from inside the building, “Or is it just that the poor folk get a pine box?  Po’ from cradle to grave, just how the system likes it, right,” the voice added a final word to agitate Marco, “*Punk?”*



Marco pulled his gun out again, his light searching into the apartment he had been inside once before.



He tapped his light on the sill, and checked on either side, right and left, for traps, even looking to the ceiling before he finally walked in.  



“Keep talking asshole,” Marco growled, “Those were good men that you killed.”



“No they ain’t,” the voice hissed from near the kitchen.



Marco spun around, eyes narrowing, still not seeing anyone, “You playing games, dick?” Marco pointed blindly into the kitchen, firing off a round, “Cause I got cheat codes for ‘Hide and Seek’.”



“I miss hide n’ seek,” the voice growled, “I miss a lot of games, this isn’t as fun.  Ain’t what I was made for, yah know?”



Marco stormed into the kitchen, looking around.



There was nothing but a fridge which stank of stale food and stagnant water in unwashed dishes.



He was as quiet as he could be, walking around the kitchen, checking cabinets.



As he opened one cabinet, something jumped out at him.



It was small, no bigger than a coffee mug, and gave him a start.



As it whipped past him, he thought he heard mechanical springs and clockwork gears shifting as it whizzed near his head.



Marco turned to where the thing ran off too, now startled as he heard scurrying moving towards the closet.



Marco turned to the opened cabinet, seeing nothing but pots and pans.



A rat, obviously.  What else could it be?  Marco told himself as he moved slowly through the apartment, his eyes shifting through the dark room, his flashlight illuminating small sections at a time as he searched.



“What were you made for, eh?” Marco asked, hoping to get information, if nothing else.



“I gots a better question: What were *you* made for?” the voice calls from near the closet.



Marco slowly made his way towards the closet, his light focused on the doorway which still had bullet holes and a few evidence markers strewn around.  “To serve and protect,” Marco said flatly as he slowly made his way to the closet.



The raspy voice echoed from the closet, “Oh, so we both ain’t going by our original designs!  Look at dat!  Peas in a pod, you ‘n me!”



Marco’s lip lifted in a sneer, “I’m doing what I’m supposed to do, prick!”



“Me too!  You workin’ for your boss as he lines ya pockets,” the voice called out.



Marco frowned, his stomach sinking.



“Oh,” the voice chuckled from the closet, “Yeah yeah, not the regular money. Nah, that dirty shit.  Corrupt as they come, the whole lot of yah!”



“They had families!” Marco snapped, rushing to the closet and opening it, seeing nothing there but coats, boots, and a shelf of board games.



“I had family too,” the voice hissed near Marco’s ear.



He spun on his heel, his eyes wide as he came face to face with the small toy monkey he had seen no more than a month ago.



Marco staggered back, confused as he lifted his pistol and light at it.



The toy’s vinyl face reflected back at Marco. Permanent marker was on its face, making its expression appear angry and happy.  A little ‘V’ on its forehead and a wide Cheshire grin on its face as its gears and mechanisms snapped and popped.  



“What the fuck…?” Marco asked no one in particular.



In a moment, the toy spoke, “I said: I had family too.” 



Marco snapped his gun up and fired, the small target scurrying up along the closet and dodging the next three shots before Marco could think.



“Itchy trigger,” the toy chuckled, “But that tracks.”



Marco narrowed his eyes, “What is this?  You some kind of remote drone or something?”



“Nah,” the toy said as it settled at the top of the closet, looking down at Marco, “I’m named Cornelius .  That’s what lil’ Tammy called me, anyway.”



Marco scoffed, “Okay, I’m either dreaming or this is some really sick joke.”



“Sick joke?” Cornelius said as his head tilted back and forth, plastic eyes shifting right and left mechanically before they settled on Marco, his gears all pausing as the voice echoed from within the plastic figure, “A sick joke is what you people did here.”



“It was an unfortunate accident,” Marco said with a grin.



Cornelius shook his head, “nah.  Wasn’t an accident.  It’s systemic,” the figure continued.



Marco laughed, “Got that revisionist history shit, puppet?”



“Look what kettle is callin’ the pot black, huh?” Cornelius began, “Youse the puppet.  Doin’ what ever dey tell yah. Long as yah get paid.  Honor and Ethics for sale, your people don’t care.”



Marco shook his head, moving closer to the closet door, “Oh?  That’s what your boss tells you?”



“Ain’t got a boss,” Cornelius explained, “Not no more.”



“What, was your boss the kid?” Marco mocked.



Cornelius’s head merely turned at an angle, adjusting while keeping Marco within his sight.



“You’re serious?” Marco laughed, “You took orders from an 8-year-old?”



Cornelius’s expression somehow seemed to sour, “I used to.  Den you showed up.  Yah know what my last orders were?”



Marco shook his head, “Tea party?”



“*Please protect us,*” Cornelius’s voice echoed in the tone of a little girl, “*Don’t let ‘em hurt us, please.”*



Marco’s expression fell, “Okay, this is a dream or a nightmare or something.”



“Nah,” Cornelius said flatly, “If it was a dream it’d be happy.  You don’t got nightmares.  You sleep like a baby,” he looks around the room, “But not the people here.  They gotta deal with the raids, and the gunshots.  No one shows up if a druggie drops someone, or there’s an OD, but the second the higher ups say that someone crossed a line? You fuckers are here, distubin’ what little peace there might be.”



“Peace?” Marco laughed, “Ain’t no peace here in the slums.”



“Cause you make it that way!” Cornelius growled, the sound of his voice surprising Marco.



Marco pointed his gun at the small toy, narrowing his eyes.



“You fucks, always making the laws work against these streets!  Keepin’ everyone here down while propping yourselves up!” Cornelius’s plastic eye lids drop slightly, gears shifting audibly, “And the second someone tries to make it better, there you fuckers are, guns blazing.”



Marco shook his head, “You’re a fucking toy,” he walked closerto the closet, “The fuck are you going to do about any of it?”



Marco felt the ground shift as he fell, something snagged his ankles and pulled them out from under him.



His head cracked on the floor as his flashlight clattered across the room, his gun a few inches from him.



His vision was hazy as he tried to get his wits about him, snapping himself out of his dazed state as he reached for his gun.



A large furry paw slapped down on the pistol, dragging it back into the closet.



Marco looked up, to his shock he saw the five foot tall teddy bear.  



Over its stomach and chest were small red X’s which sealed up the bullet holes that he had seen on it previously.  Its furry feet were stained brown, as were its hands.  There were bits of splattered brown marks across the teddy bear’s otherwise white furry chest.



“What toys do,” Cornelius said as his mechanical head twitched and snapped to the bear, “What the kids tell us to do.”



Marco groaned, trying to crawl to his gun, reaching for it with both hands.  



Just before he reached it, a cable was thrown over Marco’s wrists, pulling them up towards the closet door.  The bear had a small wench setup in the closet, which was tugging Marco up to a sitting position. 



Marco glared up at the teddy bear, tugging at the cable, shocked at how sturdy it was, “Yeah, well she’s dead!  So yah got no one to protect!”



The teddy bear leaned down, a voice echoing from inside of it.  The voice was deep, low, and menacing, “Tammy isn’t the only child here.”



“She said, protect *us*,” Cornelius’s voice echoed, as he looked at the teddy bear, “So that’s up to us,” Cornelius said.



“And what the fuck are you?!” Marco shouted.



“Misfit toys,” The teddy bear lifted up the pistol, its other furry paw moving to the trigger as he placed it to the side of Marco’s head.



Marco’s eyes went wide in fear.



“Always so fucking cocky right up until a bullet flies through you, huh?” The teddy bear’s gruff voice echoed before a gunshot rang out in the abandoned apartment.



…



Crackling through the radio in the apartment some days later is a news broadcast.



*Channel 5 news with an exclusive on the scandal that’s rocked the city!  Today, January 5th, an officer was discovered.  He had killed himself at the scene of what was once considered a raid gone wrong, but now has been revealed as a massive city-wide conspiracy.*  



*A note detailing the events and motives of all people named in the city was mailed in, and signed, by an officer who was part of the raid.  The note mailed were copies of an original suicide note that was found next to his body by federal investigators.*  



*The note detailed the guilt that the unnamed officer felt after a young girl, Tamala Fadel, was killed in the crossfire of the raid that we now know was specifically targeted to assassinate Alderman Theodore Fadel.  The young girl was Alderman Fadel’s daughter.  Federal investigators have made over thirty arrests, including the sitting mayor and several high ranking officers, in what many are calling the biggest corruption scandal in the country’s history.*  



“I got a question, Rux,” Cornelius' voice echoed as gears clicked and whirred as the toy stared at the radio, his attention turning to his partner, “Why’d yah call us misfit toys?”



Rux, the large teddy bear, turned to Cornelius, “Tammy loved those old Christmas shows,” he turned to the radio, “I thought it fit.”



“Think we’re gonna still be like this?  All movin’ and stuff?” Cornelius asked, looking at his hands, “We only woke up 12 days ago.”



Rux nodded, “Don’t worry, Cornelius, Next year,” he heaved as he slumped down on the ground, “Next year, we’ll be back.  There’s other kids that need us,” his eyes dulled as he stopped moving.



“Sounds good to me, Rux,” Cornelius said as his gears and joints slowed to a stop, “See you then, [old friend](http://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple).”",5,1766630903.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

I. The Box in the Closet

The apartment smelled like nothing.

No cinnamon, no pine, no butter melting into sugar—just the cold, clean emptiness that comes from living like you’re trying not to leave fingerprints on your own life.

Eli stood in front of the closet with his hand on the doorknob, staring as if the wood might speak first.

He hadn’t put up a tree in three years. Not since the year the hospital called at 2:17 a.m. and the world split down the center like a zipper. Since then, he’d perfected the art of December avoidance: longer shifts, headphones in public, grocery delivery instead of walking past the twinkling aisle displays. He’d become an expert at not looking.

But tonight the building’s hallway had been loud—children shrieking, someone dragging a tree upstairs, a neighbor humming a carol off-key. The sound slipped through his door like smoke, and it did what it always did: it found the bruise.

He turned the knob.

A small box sat on the top shelf, shoved behind a winter coat he never wore. The cardboard was soft at the corners, taped twice, marked in his mother’s looping handwriting:

ELI — CHRISTMAS

He reached up, and his fingers trembled, absurdly, like this box might bite.

The tape tore with a slow sigh. The lid lifted, and the smell hit him—dust, old pine, the faint ghost of perfume. Something warm and floral, something that didn’t belong in this sterile apartment. For a moment, his throat locked. He swallowed and reached in.

Tinsel. Strings of lights that hadn’t been tested in years. A paper star bent at one tip.

And then—wrapped in tissue—an ornament shaped like a small glass house.

It had been their tradition. Every year, his mother bought one ornament that meant something about the year they’d survived. Sometimes it was silly: a tiny glass coffee cup when she’d learned to stop burning it. Sometimes it was blunt: a broken heart the year Dad left.

The glass house was from the year they moved into a new place after the eviction. His mother had laughed in the store, holding it up to the fluorescent lights and saying, Look, baby. A whole house we can afford.

He held it now, and his chest tightened like a fist closing.

A sound came out of him—small, humiliating. Not quite a sob. More like a crack.

His phone buzzed on the counter. A message lit the screen.

MARA: You coming? We saved you a seat. It’s Christmas Eve, Eli.

Mara lived down the hall. She was the kind of neighbor who remembered birthdays and returned misdelivered mail with a note and a smile. She’d invited him to dinner three times this week, each invitation gentler than the last, as if she’d learned not to tug too hard on people who were already fraying.

Eli stared at her message until the letters blurred. He typed, deleted, typed again.

I can’t.

Then he erased it and wrote:

Maybe. I’m… I’m trying.

He didn’t know what that meant. He didn’t know if it was true.

He set the glass house down carefully, as if it were alive.

Under the tissue paper, something else waited: a white envelope, creased at the flap. His name again in his mother’s handwriting, but this time shakier, the loops smaller.

For Eli. When you finally open the box.

His hands went numb.

He sat on the floor, back against the closet door, the box in his lap like a cradle. For a long moment he didn’t move. The lights from the street outside made pale stripes across the carpet.

Then he broke the seal.

The letter slid out, folded in thirds. A faint imprint of her perfume rose from it like a memory you could taste.

He opened it.

And suddenly her voice was in his head so clearly it hurt.

⸻

II. The Letter That Still Knew His Name

Baby,

If you’re reading this, that means you did it.

You opened the box. You let Christmas back in the door, even just a crack.

I’m proud of you for that. Do you hear me? Proud. The kind of proud that makes my whole chest feel too full.

I’m writing this on a day when my hands don’t cooperate, so if the words look crooked, don’t tease me. I can already hear you: “Ma, you wrote like a doctor.”

You always made me laugh, even when I thought I’d forgotten how.

Eli’s vision wavered. He pressed the heel of his hand into his eye hard enough to see stars.

The paper continued:

I’m going to say something I never said out loud, because I thought if I said it, it might turn into a prophecy.

I knew I might not have a lot of Christmases.

I acted brave for you. Because you were watching. Because you deserved a mother who looked the world in the face and didn’t flinch.

But sometimes—late at night—after you went to sleep, I cried into the dish towel so you wouldn’t hear. I cried because I was scared of leaving you. I cried because I didn’t want you to carry my absence like a second spine.

Eli made a sound that was definitely a sob now. He bent forward, forehead against his knees, letter clutched between both hands like it might float away.

Listen to me, baby: if you stopped celebrating because I’m gone, that isn’t love. That’s a punishment. And you don’t deserve it.

Christmas was never about the tree. It was never about the money we didn’t have. It was about us surviving another year and finding a way to say, “We’re still here.” Even if it was messy. Even if the lights only half worked. Even if dinner was canned soup and we pretended it was fancy.

I don’t want you to be “still here” alone.

I want you to let people love you. I want you to sit at tables. I want you to say yes sometimes even when your grief has its teeth in you.

There were places on the paper where the ink looked darker, where she must have paused and pressed harder.

Do you remember the year with the paper star? The one you made in school and insisted it had to go on top because “it’s the brightest one”?

Baby, that star was crooked. The tape kept failing. It leaned like it was tired. But you loved it because it was yours, and because it meant you were trying.

That’s how I see you. That’s how I’ve always seen you.

Not perfect. Not unbreakable.

Trying.

Eli’s mouth opened, but no words came out. He couldn’t tell her he remembered. He couldn’t tell her he’d been trying in all the wrong directions—trying to be hard, trying to be numb, trying to be unmissable so nobody could ever leave him again.

The letter continued, and the sentences grew shorter, as if the effort cost her more as she went.

Here is what I want for you, my love.

I want you to open the curtains.

I want you to buy a small tree, even if it’s cheap and lopsided.

I want you to hang one ornament. Just one.

And when you do, I want you to say out loud: “I’m still here.”

Not as a promise that you’ll never hurt again.

As a promise that you won’t abandon yourself.

Eli’s shoulders shook. His chest hurt. His grief moved through him like weather—violent, honest, unstoppable.

At the bottom of the page, her handwriting wobbled into a final line.

If you can’t do it for you yet, do it for me. Then do it again next year for you.

I love you past every ending.

—Ma

He stared at the signature until it stopped being letters and became a doorway.

Behind him, the building’s hallway noise softened. Somewhere distant, someone laughed. Someone’s TV played a carol. The world continued, as if it had never asked permission to keep spinning.

Eli wiped his face with his sleeve and looked down into the box again.

The glass house ornament glimmered faintly in the streetlight.

And under it—tucked into the corner—was a small plastic bag with something else.

A tiny, folded paper star.

His paper star.

The one he’d made in school.

He held it carefully, the old tape still clinging to its points like brittle skin. The star leaned even in his hand, crooked and tired and absurdly precious.

His throat tightened so hard he could barely breathe.

His mother had saved it.

She had saved him.

His phone buzzed again.

MARA: I’m putting aside a plate. No pressure. But if you come, I’ll be happy to see you.

Eli stared at the screen. His thumb hovered.

No pressure. But I’ll be happy to see you.

It wasn’t the invitation that broke him. It was how simple it was. How love could be offered like a warm seat, not a demand. How it could wait without resentment.

He looked at the paper star in his hand, then the letter, then the glass house.

His mother’s voice lived in him like an ember.

Open the curtains.

His curtains were closed.

He stood up slowly, knees stiff from sitting on the floor. He carried the letter to the living room, as if it might shatter if he moved too quickly. The apartment felt different now—less like a blank page and more like a room someone had once lived in.

He crossed to the window.

His fingers touched the fabric.

He hesitated.

Then he pulled.

The curtains slid open. The city’s Christmas lights blinked from balconies and windows and streetlamps. Far below, people moved like small, urgent stories. Snow didn’t fall here, but the air looked cold anyway, full of breath and headlights.

Eli stood there a long time, just looking at the world he’d been refusing to see.

Then he went back to the closet.

⸻

III. The Lopsided Tree

He didn’t own a tree. The nearest thing he owned to holiday décor was a lonely string of white lights in the box and a grief he’d wrapped around himself like garland.

So he did something he hadn’t done in a long time:

He left the apartment on Christmas Eve.

The lobby smelled like pine—someone had put up a communal tree near the mailboxes. The building’s elderly security guard nodded at him with sleepy kindness.

Outside, the wind slapped his cheeks awake. A few blocks away, a corner shop still glowed, open late for last-minute desperation.

Eli walked with his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched. The sidewalks were damp. People hurried past carrying bags, carrying children, carrying each other.

At the corner shop, the owner—a tired man with a Santa hat pushed back on his head—looked up.

“Need something?” he asked.

Eli’s voice came out rough. “Do you have… like… a small tree?”

The owner’s eyebrows rose slightly, as if Eli had asked for a relic.

“In the back,” he said. “Not pretty. But it’s alive.”

Alive.

Eli nodded like that mattered.

The owner returned with a small potted spruce. It leaned to one side, sparse in places. It looked like it had been overlooked by everyone more cheerful.

Eli stared at it.

“It’s… fine,” he said, and his throat caught on the word. Fine meant still here. Fine meant it made it, somehow.

The owner named a price. Eli paid without arguing.

As the owner bagged the tree, he said, softer, “For your place?”

Eli nodded.

“Good,” the man said. “It’s good to have something green inside. Reminds the heart what it’s for.”

Eli didn’t trust himself to answer.

He carried the tree home like it was fragile, like it was a promise that could crack if he swung it too hard.

Upstairs, he set it on the small table by the window. It leaned toward the glass, as if trying to see the lights outside.

He opened the box again.

The string lights were tangled, stubborn. He worked them loose with patient fingers. Half of them didn’t light at first. He tried another outlet, wiggled the plug, cursed under his breath.

Then, suddenly, they blinked on—soft and warm, imperfect.

He draped them around the little spruce. The glow made the needles look gentler.

Eli held the glass house ornament in his palm.

He didn’t hang all the ornaments. He didn’t have the strength. The letter had only asked for one.

Just one.

His hands shook as he hooked it onto a branch near the center.

The glass caught the light and threw it back, tiny bright shards dancing across the wall.

His throat tightened again.

He stood in front of the tree and stared. The apartment smelled faintly of pine now. Not enough to drown the emptiness, but enough to interrupt it.

He reached into the box and took out the paper star.

The old tape didn’t stick anymore. He laughed once—an ugly, wet sound.

“Of course,” he whispered, as if to the star. As if to his mother.

He found a small clip from the junk drawer and fastened the star to the top branch. It leaned crookedly, exactly as it always had.

Eli backed up.

The tree looked ridiculous and brave.

He thought of his mother in that cramped kitchen years ago, stirring canned soup and calling it “chef’s special,” humming while the lights blinked like they were fighting to stay alive.

He swallowed.

Then, because the letter had asked—because sometimes love is an instruction you finally trust—he spoke out loud.

“I’m still here.”

His voice cracked on here.

He tried again, louder, as if telling the room, the city, the universe that had taken her.

“I’m still here.”

A sob rose in him, hot and immediate. He didn’t shove it down this time. He let it take him. He sank to his knees on the carpet in front of the tiny leaning tree and cried like someone who had been holding his breath for years.

When the worst of it passed, he sat there, breathing hard, face wet, the lights blinking softly above him.

His phone sat on the counter, silent.

Eli picked it up and stared at Mara’s message again.

No pressure. But I’ll be happy to see you.

He typed with trembling fingers:

I have a small tree. It’s ugly. I think my mom would’ve loved it.

He stared at the words, then added:

Can I come downstairs?

The reply came almost instantly.

MARA: Yes. And ugly trees are my favorite.

Eli’s chest did something strange—like it remembered how to be held.

He looked at the tree one last time before leaving, as if making sure it would still be there when he returned.

The lights blinked.

Still here.

⸻

IV. The Seat That Waited

Mara’s apartment door was cracked open, warmth spilling into the hallway like a hand reaching out.

Inside, the smell was overwhelming—in the best way. Garlic, roasted chicken, something sweet baking. The living room glowed with lamplight and a tree that was too big for the corner, its branches crowded with ornaments.

Mara appeared in the doorway, a dish towel over her shoulder, her hair slightly frazzled like she’d been wrestling with food and time.

When she saw Eli, her face softened. She didn’t do the thing people did—tilting their head, making pity into a question. She just smiled, simple and real.

“Hey,” she said.

Eli stood awkwardly at the threshold, as if the warmth might reject him.

“Hey,” he managed.

Mara stepped back. “Come in. Shoes wherever. No pressure to talk. No pressure to be cheerful. Just… come in.”

He walked inside like someone entering a memory he’d been banned from.

The table was set for several people—Mara, her brother, an older woman Eli recognized from the mailroom, a couple from the second floor. People looked up and smiled. Someone said, “Hi!” like it was the easiest thing in the world to include him.

A chair waited with a plate already beside it.

Eli’s throat tightened again.

Mara touched his elbow lightly—one brief point of contact, a reminder that he was solid.

“I saved you the seat,” she said, almost casual.

Eli nodded, unable to speak.

As he sat, his eyes landed on something near Mara’s tree: a small ornament shaped like a glass house.

His breath caught.

Mara followed his gaze and said quietly, “My mom started that tradition. One ornament a year. It’s… kind of how I keep track of surviving.”

Eli stared at the glass house. His hands clenched in his lap.

Mara sat beside him, not too close, not too far. Her voice lowered so only he could hear.

“You don’t have to be okay tonight,” she said. “You just have to be here.”

Eli swallowed. The room blurred slightly. He nodded once.

Dinner began with clinking plates and awkward jokes and someone’s child on speakerphone singing a carol off-key. Eli listened more than he talked. He ate slowly, as if his body had forgotten how to accept warmth.

At one point, the older woman across the table raised her glass.

“To the ones we miss,” she said simply.

The room quieted for a beat.

“To the ones we miss,” everyone echoed.

Eli’s hands shook as he lifted his water glass.

“To the ones we miss,” he whispered.

And in that quiet, he felt it—sharp and strange.

Not the absence.

The presence.

His mother wasn’t in the chair beside him. She wasn’t stirring soup in his kitchen. She wasn’t humming.

But her love—her insistence—was here in the shape of his breath. In the fact that he had opened the curtains. In the fact that he had walked out of his apartment carrying something alive.

He blinked hard.

Mara glanced at him and whispered, “You okay?”

Eli hesitated. Then, because something in him was tired of hiding, he said the truth.

“I opened the box,” he whispered back. “She… she left me a letter.”

Mara’s eyes softened, but she didn’t pry. She just nodded, reverent, like he’d placed something sacred on the table between them.

“I’m glad,” she said. “I’m really glad.”

After dinner, people drifted to the living room. Someone put on music quietly. The tree lights made slow shadows on the walls.

Eli stood near the window, watching the street below. Mara came beside him with two mugs of something steaming.

“Hot chocolate,” she said. “It’s not fancy.”

He took it. Their fingers brushed. His throat tightened again.

Mara leaned against the wall. “So,” she said lightly, “tell me about your ugly tree.”

Eli almost smiled, the expression unfamiliar on his face like clothes he hadn’t worn in years.

“It’s small,” he said. “It leans. Half the lights don’t work. And the star on top is… ridiculous.”

“That sounds perfect,” Mara said.

Eli stared into the mug, steam curling like breath. He whispered, almost to himself, “She saved the star.”

Mara’s voice went softer. “Of course she did.”

Eli’s eyes stung. He nodded once, hard.

Outside, someone set off a small firework—just a pop and a brief flash that reflected in the window like a blink.

Eli took a slow breath.

For the first time in years, it didn’t feel like breathing was a betrayal.

He looked at the tree in Mara’s apartment, then imagined the little leaning spruce in his own place, its crooked paper star holding its brave angle.

He thought of the letter in his pocket, folded carefully like a heart you didn’t want to crumple.

He swallowed.

“I said it out loud,” he admitted, voice shaking. “Like she told me to.”

Mara didn’t ask what he’d said. She just waited.

Eli’s voice broke anyway. “I’m still here.”

Mara’s hand lifted, hesitated, then rested gently on his shoulder.

“I know,” she whispered. “I can see you.”

Eli closed his eyes. The pressure of her hand was small, human, steady. It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t bring anyone back.

But it did what love is supposed to do:

It kept him from falling through the floor.

When he opened his eyes again, the room was warm, and the lights were blinking, and he was sitting at a table with other living people, and his grief was still there—but it wasn’t the only thing in the room anymore.

Outside, the city kept shining.

Inside, Eli took another breath.

Still here.

And for the first time, he believed the words could mean more than survival. 😭",1,1766630751.0,ChatGPTcomplaints,1,1.0,False

This is on 8 January in L.A.'s Griffith Park, where some of Lost Highway's exteriors and driving scenes are being shot. He is standing in the bristly underbrush off the dirt road between the base camp's trailers and the set, peeing on a stunted pine. Mr. David Lynch, a prodigious coffee drinker, apparently pees hard and often, and neither he nor the production can afford the time it'd take to run down the base camp's long line of trailers to the trailer where the bathrooms are every time he needs to pee. So my first (and generally representative) sight of Lynch is from the back, and (understandably) from a distance. Lost Highway's cast and crew pretty much ignore Lynch's urinating in public, (though I never did see anybody else relieving themselves on the set again, Lynch really was exponentially busier than everybody else.) and they ignore it in a relaxed rather than a tense or uncomfortable way, sort of the way you'd ignore a child's alfresco peeing.""",20,1766630657.0,davidlynch,1,0.95,False

Monday,  in Calgary Alberta,  I put my truck in thebl shop for a door repair.  I went across the street to the Pilot Flying J Travel center to wait it out.  A place to sit and relax, stress free.   So you would think. 

So the outside facilities are having major repairs done.  So the pumps are closed, the main store and showers.

The hair dresser, laundromat, audio store, chrome store and washrooms are open.

There are tables and chairs for people to sit around... and there is a driver's lounge with about 4 chairs and a TV.... which is hardly ever used.  When I first started driving 9  years ago, I noticed that.

Anyway.

So I enter the building, walk around to use the washroom and come out to sit I one of the armchairs.

There are 4 guys sitting in the plaza....very slow because they are doing renovations... I get that..

There are two Indian guys sitting in two of the armchairs soon as you walk in main entrance...  to the left there are two tables and chairs sets... there wasna white guy sitting at one of them.  Across, almost diagonally,  there are two tables with two arm chairs at both.  That is where I decided to sit.  I am a 58 year black man. 

So... I take my high vis jacket and toque off and put it on the arm of one chair, and sit in the other.  I had my black reusable bag with me.  I took out my tablet, phone and Dewalt jump starter that I just bought the day before so i could read the instructions. 

So, I got everything sorted on the table... oh yea, I had a Tim Hortons coffee with me.

So here I am reading the DeWalt manual. And looking around in the meantime.  I see 3 single people (guys) go to the, 1 pair (2 guys friends) and 1 single female.  I see an Asian go by 2 or 3 times.

Didn't have any interactions with anyone whatsoever.... I was reading my material...

So then,  all of a sudden,  I have this big tall Indian security gaurd come over very fast and, I say mildly aggressive saying in very broken English;

Are you construction?:

Me:. Sorry, I don't understand 

Him:  are worker?

are you truck driver?

Me:  yes

Him: let me see your driver's license

Me:  yea, that is not going to happen

Him:  you need to prove you are a tuck driver

Me:  lol, that's funny.

Him:  I have the legal authority to ask for your ID 

ME... I'm told he's not getting my ID... I am sitting minding my own business.... if, with your bullshit need to leave this stupid place because I am sitting here reading minding my own business,  then fine... but I sure as hell don't have anything to prove to you, or have to show you ID... and I left... felt like I was being walked out more like it. 

Anyway, I'm for anyone who doesn't get it... I am sitting there minding my own business.

There is a whole lot more to the story...

I’ve been reading some old  threads and watching a bunch of EDC YouTube videos, and honestly I can’t seem to find any true “must‑have” items that apply to me. It feels like a lot of EDC setups are either very situational, fashion- or hobby‑driven.

I’ve just started a digital nomad journey and this is basically all I carry every day:
1. An old Lenovo laptop, mouse, and headset for work and meetings  
2. A vest/tank top (I sneak out for runs or quick workouts)  
3. A T‑shirt, sneakers & hoodie
4. A multi‑country adapter for my iPhones (2 of them), AirPods, and work laptop  
5. YouTube premium for music 
6. Passport wallets for my passports and boarding pass

I run a small software company solo, so Wi‑Fi is really the only non‑negotiable. I work out of coffee shops for that and head home for dinner when the kids and family are back. I travel internationally to other asian countries once a month.

Looking at all the EDC threads, I keep thinking: am I missing something, or is minimal carry actually the point?

For those of you who swear by EDC, what’s the one thing you carry every day that actually earns its place? i don’t need any keychain or those matte black carabiners (sp)? And why?

1pv35yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pv35yi/what_do_i_do_about_my_mom/,What do I do about my mom?,"Hello, Reddit!

I’m an 18M who just left for college, and I’m going through a pretty awkward rough patch like a lot of people my age. Lately I’ve been struggling with my relationship with my mom, and I’m not sure what’s normal growing pains versus something I should actually be concerned about. I care about her, but I also feel overwhelmed and unsure how to handle things right now. Any advice would be appreciated.

Like a lot of young adults who try long-distance relationships, I’m currently going through a breakup. She’s a senior in high school, and I didn’t realize until now how close we really were. I planned birthdays and holidays with her, and honestly she was the highlight of those times. The point isn’t the breakup itself, but that this very positive relationship has made me notice some shortcomings in the dynamic between my mom and me, and I’m not sure what to do with that realization.

Now that I’m legally an adult, she can’t punish me in the ways she used to (taking my phone, sending me to my room, etc.), so the behavior has changed. She has hidden food in the house, forced me to pay for groceries despite financial constraints, and told me I need to shower or sleep somewhere else because hot water and a bed are “privileges.” 

A major source of these conflicts is the car. She does not have a car, and I do. She frequently asks me for rides, and I help unless I’m working or the request is a large one and I already have plans. When I say no, she completely loses it. She resorts to screaming, crying, and making personal attacks like “you’ve been pathetic since your breakup.” The thing is, she *does* have other transportation options. There are several people nearby who are willing to help her if I can’t. She often asks me to stop and grab her a soda, or a coffee, because it is “only $1.99.” That is true, but if I buy her one every time she asks, that will add up VERY quickly for someone like me just getting on their feet. I genuinely don’t feel that saying ""no"" sometimes warrants this level of hostility.

There are a lot of arguments and examples I could give, but I’ll try to focus on the main patterns. Whenever my mom feels like she’s losing power in an argument, she lashes out and attacks whatever she can. I’ve been told things like “your grandma would be so disappointed in you” and “I hate you as a person.” At first, I told myself she was just blowing off steam, but over time I’ve started to feel like she actually means these things.

She also calls me a “snob” for not helping her financially. Recently she asked me to lend her $50 for a bill, and I said I didn’t have it, which was true. I’m a college student and work as a DoorDash driver. She insists I’m lying about my finances and accuses me of hiding money. I’ll admit that I can have an attitude sometimes, but I don’t insult her or scream at her. I try to stay calm, respond with “okay,” and disengage. That said, it does build up, and occasionally I lose my cool and tell her to stop talking. I don’t name-call, I just sometimes desperately need the interaction to end.

What really bothers me is the hypocrisy. We lived a two-minute drive from my school growing up. When the weather was warm, I walked. When it was extremely cold, she still insisted I walk because she was “entitled to sleep” and “it's three-tenths of a mile”. When I was younger and struggling badly with my mental health, I went to her scared about self harm and asked for help. She drove me to a hospital but refused to leave until I reassured her that she was a good mom and said I was lying about how I felt (which I wasn’t). She regularly calls me manipulative and says I’m “just like my dad,” who has never been in my life. She also cries to me about how she doesn’t want to end up alone when she’s old and believes her kids are ungrateful and won’t be there for her.

My stepfather completely disagrees with how she treats me. He tells me I’m a good kid and is consistently supportive. I’m proud of myself. I’m the first in my family to attend college, I’m on a full ride, I don’t owe the school any money, I pay my own bills, and I’m saving to hopefully transfer to a school in DC and pursue a career in politics. I know one thing for sure… I do not want to treat my future kids the way I’ve been treated.

She just generally seems to hate me, to be frank. I don’t know if what I’m experiencing qualifies as emotional abuse or neglect, but I do know I feel deeply let down, exhausted, and unsure how to handle this relationship going forward. Without a companion here to lean on when I need to, I just feel so disappointed. 

What do I do in this situation? How do you deal with a parent like this while still protecting your mental health? Can anybody relate to this, or help me understand why she acts this way???

you know, i always said i hate people but it turns out i hate only cowardly people. Everyone has his own battles, trauma, and struggles, but what I hate most is someone projecting their own insecurities and being a coward just to seem like the hero. 

after all the shit i have been through for 8 years i learnt one thing, if i want something i will have to fight for it, that goes along with if i am not ready for the fight i dont even start it, but dont be a coward and stare at the thing you want saying ""oh i wish i can have it but i cant"" and pretend to be a martyr sacrificing your own needs for the greater good just because you are not courage enough to fight for it and admit that to yourself. 

Also don't think that everything will be handed to you on a silver platter, and all you have to do is be grateful for what you have. We are conditioned to be given things without asking when we were kids, to the point that we expect it throughout life.

And i am talking about everything not just relationships, you will have to fight for your dream job as equal as fighting for the girl of your dream (or guy). That saying of "" if you want something the universe will collectively work towards giving you what you attract ""that's bullshit, not everyone gets what they want, that's just life boo-freaking-hoo!!, You either fight for it or you don't, 

but that kinda talk of ""oh if it was meant to be, it will be given to me"" that's slacking and disgusting. and i dont care being nice about it and say ""rome was not built in a day or what comes easy goes easy yada yada yada ""we all know that talk and we say it with our huge chest while watching TV, legs on the table, sipping coffee, but when shit hit the fan, its the ""i cant be the person of your dreams and i cant do the job or learn the new thing or be a better person "" 

but you can be the asshole, eh? That sounds like the logical solution for all your problems and being a coward admitting TO yourself that you WONT, not CANT

1pv32ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1pv32ku/how_to_become_insanely_magnetic_the_psychology_of/,How to Become Insanely Magnetic: The Psychology of Making People NEED to Be Around You,"looked around at a party last weekend and noticed something wild. There's always that one person everyone orbits around. Not the loudest. Not the hottest. just... magnetic. 

Spent months diving into social psychology research, reading books on charisma, binging charisma on command's youtube deep dives, listening to podcasts with actual behavioral scientists. Turns out, being magnetic isn't some genetic lottery, it's a skill set you can build. Backed by actual neuroscience and psychology.

…and here's the thing society won't tell you: we're biologically wired to be anxious in social settings. Your brain still thinks rejection means getting kicked out of the tribe and dying alone. So when you feel awkward or invisible at gatherings, that's not a personal failing. that's evolution being dramatic. But you can rewire these patterns with the right tools.

**the eye contact thing nobody talks about**

Most people either stare too hard or avoid eye contact like it's a solar eclipse. The sweet spot? hold eye contact for 3-4 seconds, then briefly look away. Comes from research on attachment and connection. It makes the other person feel seen without feeling hunted.

Vanessa van edwards breaks this down perfectly in her book ""Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People"". She's a behavioral investigator who's spent 12+ years studying what makes people click. The book is basically a cheat code for human behavior. Insanely good read that'll make you question everything you thought about first impressions. She uses actual data from analyzing thousands of ted talks and social interactions. Not fluffy advice, but pure pattern recognition.

Practice this everywhere. Coffee shops, grocery stores, random conversations. Your brain will slowly stop freaking out about eye contact.

**ask questions that aren't boring as hell**

Everyone asks ""what do you do"" or ""where are you from"". Predictable. Forgettable. 

…instead try: ""what's been exciting you lately?"" or ""what's consuming most of your headspace right now?"" People light up differently when you ask about their internal world rather than their resume.

This comes from harvard business school research on question-asking and rapport building. questions that invite storytelling create way stronger bonds than biographical interrogation.

Chris Voss's ""Never Split the Difference"" isn't just a negotiation book. it's a masterclass in making people feel understood. Voss was the fbi's lead hostage negotiator, and he figured out how to get terrorists to trust him. The tactical empathy techniques work just as well at dinner parties. Genuinely one of the best communication books ever written. You'll never have another boring conversation after reading it.

**the charisma equation is actually simple**

warmth + competence. That's it. Research from princeton's social psychology lab shows people judge you on these two dimensions within milliseconds.

*warmth*: smile more (genuine ones, your eyes crinkle), open body language, lean in slightly when people talk, remember small details they mentioned last time.

*competence*: have actual opinions about things, speak clearly, know your stuff but don't be insufferable about it, admit when you don't know something.

Most people max out one and ignore the other. Ultra competent people come off cold. 
Super warm people seem flaky. Balance both and you become magnetic.

**be interested not interesting**

The charisma myth is thinking you need to be fascinating. wrong. People's favorite topic is themselves. Neuroscience shows talking about yourself activates the same pleasure centers as food and money.

Let people talk about their interests, their projects, their dog's weird habits. Ask follow up questions. Actually listen instead of waiting for your turn to talk.

Tried this at a networking thing and barely talked about myself for 30 minutes. Person later told three people I was ""one of the most interesting conversations they'd had."" Didn't even say anything about me. I just asked good questions and cared about the answers.

**apps worth checking out**

Ash is basically a pocket relationship coach powered by psychology research. Helps you navigate tricky social dynamics, gives you scripts for awkward situations, builds actual emotional intelligence. It’s way better than googling ""how to not be weird at parties"" at 2am. The app uses attachment theory and communication frameworks to help you understand your social patterns.

BeFreed is an AI learning app that creates personalized podcasts from expert sources like research papers, books, and interviews. It builds an adaptive learning plan based on what you want to master, whether that's social skills or emotional intelligence. you can customize each session from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples. The depth control is clutch when you're actually trying to internalize communication patterns instead of just skimming surface-level advice. Plus you can chat with the virtual coach about specific situations you're struggling with.

**master the art of storytelling**

Magnetic people tell stories that land. Not long rambling ones but short, vivid ones with a point.

*structure*: set the scene quickly, build slight tension, deliver the punchline or insight, end it cleanly. Practice cutting the boring setup parts. get to the good stuff faster.

Matthew Dicks's ""Storyworthy"" teaches this better than anything. He's a 55-time Moth Storyslam champion who's literally studied what makes stories grip people. This book will make you 10x better at dinner parties, presentations, or just texting your friends. highly recommend if you've ever told a story and watched people's eyes glaze over.

**the listening superpower**

Most people listen at like 25% capacity while planning what to say next. Magnetic people actually absorb what you're saying.

*technique*: after someone finishes talking, pause for literally one second before responding. It shows you're processing, not just waiting. Also occasionally paraphrase back what they said: ""so basically you're feeling burnt out because the promotion added stress but not fulfillment?""

People will feel more understood talking to you for five minutes than they do with most friends they've known for years.

**energy management over time management**

Be the person who shows up energized. Sounds simple but most people arrive to social things already depleted.

Protect your energy before events. Don't schedule back to back obligations. Eat properly. Limit alcohol (makes you sloppy and forgettable, not charming). Leave when you're still having fun, not when you're exhausted. People remember how you made them feel, and exhausted people radiate ""I want to leave"" energy that kills conversations.

**the vulnerability sweet spot**

Share something real occasionally. not trauma dumping. just... human stuff. ""been struggling with motivation lately"" or ""honestly have no idea what I'm doing with my career right now.""

Brené Brown's research at University of Houston shows vulnerability creates connection. But there's a dose response. Too much overwhelms people. Too little makes you seem robotic. 

Magnetic people share enough to seem human without making others their therapist.

You're not broken if social situations drain you or you feel invisible sometimes. Your brain is running ancient software in a modern world. But magnetic presence is learnable. Small shifts in how you show up compound into becoming someone people genuinely want to be around.

1pv31qp,https://v.redd.it/123g3rwke99g1,"Christmas Truce, but your simply thankful for celebrating in the first place","December 25 — FOB Ronograd

Christmas found us quiet for once.

No rotor wash, no crack of rifles echoing through frozen trees—just the hum of generators and the wind coming off the island, cutting through everything. After weeks of clearing forest after forest of insurgents on Ronograd, the silence feels unreal. Earned, but unreal. We’re finally getting a pause, and none of us are saying it out loud for fear of jinxing it.
I’m thankful tonight. Truly. Not many of the boys have been seriously hurt so far. Scratches, concussions, busted knees—stuff we can laugh about later. We’ve been lucky, and every Ranger here knows luck runs out eventually. That makes this rest feel heavier, like something fragile you don’t want to touch too hard.

Earlier today I shared coffee with a British infantryman who somehow managed to scrounge up a tin of cookies. A Canadian medic joined us, joking about how Christmas back home probably had better weather and worse food. Even ran into a couple Russian soldiers attached to the area security detail—awkward at first, but it didn’t take long before we were all talking about the same thing. Families. Food. How stupid it is that the world doesn’t stop fighting for just one day.

Funny how that works. Different flags, different accents, same wish—to celebrate without carrying a rifle, without watching tree lines, without counting steps and angles. For a few minutes, it almost felt normal.

I miss home more today than I have in a while. Mom’s cooking, Dad’s bad jokes, the way the house smells on Christmas morning. I wonder if they’re thinking about me the same way I’m thinking about them, and I hope they don’t worry too much. I don’t want them picturing the forests here, or the things we’ve had to do in them.

Still, I’m grateful. Grateful for the men around me—the Rangers I trust with my life, who’ve become brothers faster than I ever thought possible. We don’t share blood, but we share cold nights, fear, laughter, and the understanding that tomorrow we’ll stand up again if we have to.

Tonight, though, we rest. We eat terrible FOB food, trade stories, and pretend—just for a little while—that this frozen Russian island is enough of a home.

I had to find a way to make it exciting and surprising, and quickly settled on making it one of the gifts that appear under the tree after Santa makes his visit. Then the real ah-ha hit me, it was a Grimoire after all, clearly it must be a gift from something much older. 

I set about the house, finding brown packing paper from Amazon packages. One piece was the perfect size, and I carefully wrapped the book in it, taking care to use tape on the inside of the folds to make the wrapping look more natural.  It looked fantastic, but it needed more. It needed a crafted letter from Father Yule.

Using a less attractive cut of the packing paper, after workshopping my message and technique, I penciled in my intent and then went over it in a thin tipped marker. After a failed tea staining, a successful instant coffee staining, and a nervous 7 minutes of holding a lighter to it and thinking any moment of that could set me back to square one, I finally had a proper scroll.  A quick trip to hobby lobby yielded me a reasonable twine.

I would have liked to have spent more time on styling the tie of the twine, but I'm happy with the result. I'm even impressed with my choice to stain the wrap, I felt that was a bit of a gamble.  Thus a new tradition has been born that I will carry into next year, along with plans to make a Yule wreath.

Just thought I would share, and see if any one else does anything interesting like this during this season.

Wishing you all a wonderful Yule celebration,
Cheers!",9,1766628905.0,pagan,1,0.91,False

I just need to yell into the void. Nonadvice needed. My in laws are visiting. And I should mention, I am very progressive and culturally aware, etc, and we are two completely different cultures, we don't speak the same language, and I'm as accommodating as I can be. But I have fucking had it. 

I've had some communication blunders and bloopers, usually it's fine. But I just can't. I'm always hands off when they visit so they can spend time with the kids, but that means I hardly see my own kids and it's fucking christmas. 

I'm busy cleaning up after some stupid shit every day, so I don't have time to bake cookies or even go for a walk. 

Annoying things from just this current visit: 
- a dog poop shoe, poop-side down, on my clean ass kitchen counter (dog poop in my kitchen sink)

- fish scales and raw juice literally everywhere within a 6 ft radius of my sink (the counters, my appliances, the clean dish drain, all over the floor, juice on the cabinets, fridge, a raw fish juice knife in the clean dishes, and more - MIL descaled tjat thing and just left the mess and walked off, who tf does that?)

- raw meat juice in the fridge (no tray, leaking from the top shelf down, fun fun)

- my cast iron skillet (i worked so hard to get this thing seasoned beautifully, now smells like fish)

- fridge (now smells like raw fish)


Y'all. 

And previous visits: 
My cast iron passed down from my mom (again, beautifully seasoned) in the fucking dishwasher)

My immersion blender in the dishwasher 

A pot of coffee spilled down the front of the cabinets (and inside on my appliances) but not cleaned up or even mentioned

Like 50 cigarette butts in my backyard where my kids and dogs roam



There's so much more. I can't verbally communicate with them, and they pretty much dismiss anything my spouse says. I am ready to explode. I've dealt with enough BS with my dad lately, and I'm really over grandparents thinking they get a free pass. I am ready to sit-down and have a powwow. I have spent 8 years walking on eggshells and trying my hardest to respect their culture and teach my kids about it, give them allllll the time to visit and bond with the kids. I don't agree with a lot of their cultural norms (patriarchal, women do like all the work and cooking, respect elders no matter what). But I've always been gracious and accommodating. I am tired of being told I look sick, or too tired, or being nagged to come sit and eat eat eat eat (this is so annoying - i am an adult, respect my answer of ""no thank you, I'm not hungry.""), or why am I not out with the kids (because I'm cleaning fucking fish scales off my floor before the dogs can eat them and always sterilizing shit because nobody wants to wash with soap). And I get so stressed when they take the kids for walks because my FIL likes to walk in the damned road (we live in a nice neighborhood with a new ass sidewalk) - when my oldest was 1.5, FIL tried urging him to walk/toddler in the road with him - like are you nuts? 

Gah there's more. I just needed to get this off my chest. 


Thank you if you read this far. 

I'm still trying to do shit with my kids. I'm just sad because Christmas used to be my favorite holiday, but now I dread it. 

PS. I have used so many translating apps, but they aren't accurate. Their language isn't common and not supported in a lot of apps. ",23,1766628857.0,breakingmom,8,0.96,False

I ended up at this tiny cafe for lunch, sat down at an outdoor table, and started scrolling through my phone.

Out of nowhere, this guy at the next table looks over and goes, ""Hey, aren't you from (my hometown)?"" I was like, what? Turns out he recognized me from high school - we weren't friends or anything, just in a couple classes together like 10 years earlier. He was there on vacation with his family too.

But here's where it gets strange: we start chatting, and it turns out we were both on the exact same flight from the US a few days before, sat like three rows apart, and never noticed each other. Then we took the same train to this town, and ended up at the same cafe on the same day. The town isn't even a big tourist spot - it's super off the beaten path.

We laughed about it and grabbed a coffee together, but I still think about how crazy the odds were. Like, what are the chances in a whole different country?

Anyone else have a coincidence like that? Feels like the universe was trolling me haha.",39,1766628670.0,CasualConversation,12,1.0,False

Each module was an hour long. I couldn’t believe what was happening. This is hell, I’m trapped in a boring ass, shitty job, I had modules to complete that can last decades. Papers upon papers to read and sign my signature on. 

I went along with the insanity of this, maybe, once the day was done, I could just clock out. I will be able to leave this bullshit, go home, and not come back. Finally, 5 PM came, and I was able to leave this nonsense. I went over to the clock out machine to clock out with my magical badge that appeared on me. I took a deep breath in/out, smiled, and clocked myself out.

The machine went from 5 PM to 9 AM the instant I pressed my badge to the sensor.

“Good morning! Mr. Thomas!” Major Tom announced excitingly, “Ready for another day of work! I love my job!”

“Wait,” I responded in shock, “I’m supposed to be clocked out. I’m supposed to leave.”

“You clock in, then you clock out, then you clock in,” Major Tom explained, “you’ll get used to it.”

“What!?” I exclaimed, “I can’t even leave this place when I’m done!”

“Not until you finish your modules and paperwork,” Major Tom answered.

“That’ll take me thousands and thousands of years!” I shouted, “I have 100s of thousands of modules and the stack of papers gets higher and higher!”

“I believe in you, my friend, I can relate, I gotta a lot of work too,” he said.

“I can’t leave! I’ve seen you leave back to your house!”

“That’s another Major Tom, he's a different Major Tom for a different job,” Major Tom explained as he poured coffee into a tube in the fishbowl that led to his mouth, “I think the reason for so many Major Tom's is because the creator dislikes paperwork. That’s my theory. I don't know, I just work here.”

I ran back to my cubicle and sat there shaking. The withdrawal was starting to creep up on me and I needed a fix. I started to sweat, get sniffles, and my mind started to break. 

The aches and pains were starting to appear in my body. I needed to do a bump, or I would smash that stupid fishbowl head of his. I hated that this prick surrounded me, that was the only person that was here besides the monster woman.

I started to begin the modules and paperwork to distract me from the withdrawal symptoms. It was endless, the more I completed, the more they popped up in my email. Emails and notifications kept pouring into my computer/phone like a flood of bureaucratic diarrhea. I signed and completed the documents/papers, but that felt useless because more papers just appeared on top of the pile like some never-ending Jenga tower. 

I tried reading the documents, but they were covered in endless legal jargon, abbreviations, and nonsensical run-on sentences. Some of the documents were in Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, Chinese, and honestly, every language. A document can switch from one language to another in the middle of a paragraph. 

Sometimes, there were blank pages, a page in an unknown alien language that I couldn't recognize, a wet page, and scratches/redacted where words should be. I didn't even know what I was signing most of the time. I got up and walked to the bathroom, trying to avoid the infinite Major Toms. I was dazed and confused from the endless documents. The nasty withdrawal symptoms weren't helping, but making things much worse.

I decided to text my girlfriend while sitting on the toilet.

*Me: Baby, you were right, I should have never taken the job.*

*Katie: oh shit, the guy must've been dangerous. Did you get shot? Stabbed? What happened?*

*Me: worse, I'm in some fucked up office space with infinite paperwork, modules, and Major Toms. Some psycho monster HR lady named Karen.*

*Katie: Are you screwing with me?*

*Me: NO! I NEED HELP! I AM IN THE BATHROOM!*

*Katie: what the fuck are you talking about?*

*Me: I AM BEING HELD HOSTAGE IN SOME STUPID, SHITTY OFFICE AGAINST MY WILL!*

*Katie: Why all caps?*

*Knock! Knock! Knock!*

“Excuse me, is there someone in there?” Major Tom asked.

I ignored the fishbowl wearing weirdo, hoping that he'd go away.

*Knock! Knock! Knock!*

 “The coffee went through me pretty fast. I need to drop the kids off at the pool if you know what I mean,” Major Tom chuckled after a long silence.

*Me: I am stuck with the fishbowl wearing asshat!*

*Katie: Are you on drugs?*

*Me: all he does is drink coffee through some stupid tube. ALL HIS JOKES SUCK ASS!*

*Katie: text me when your crazy high wears off*

*Me: HELP ME!*

I walked out of the bathroom to the endless sterile, white cubicles and offices. The bathroom was on the only white wall in the office space. The wall extended to infinity with endless bathrooms. Why the hell did Major stupid ass face Tom bother me if there's literally infinite bathrooms?

“So, you were the one in the bathroom,” Major Tom said as he approached me, “you gotta answer when someone knocks... you know.”

I gritted my teeth and walked away furiously to my desk. I was met with a pile of papers that extended all the way to the sky. I followed the paperwork up with my eyes and saw no ceiling. This place made no sense, and every little detail was breaking my brain. How did it get so high if I was only gone for a few minutes?

“Wow! Try not to topple that over!” Major Tom exclaimed as stared at the massive paper pile, “the clean up crew of Major Tom's won't be too happy with the mess if that Mount Everest avalanche goes down.”

I faced Major Tom and glared at him furiously. He stared back with an emotionless straight face while pouring the coffee into his tube. I never paid attention, but his eyes were an odd color. 

One eye was silver, and the other was brown. He always wore the same grey suit no matter what. I usually don't pay attention to the eyes and fashion of my targets. I did just now, who the hell was this guy?

I decided to study his file that my employer sent me for the assassination. Major Tom was born in Free/North Panama, UES, a country that doesn't exist! this guy is from some place that literally doesn't exist!

When he went to work, he performed audits on the business, he didn't even work in the office. He was part of an agency called, “solar audit departments,” he worked for SAD. 

I searched for it on a search engine, but it doesn't exist. His birth date was over 100 years in the future. He shouldn't even exist. How did I not notice the nonsense in this guy's background?

“You are required to go to Mrs. Aza, our emotional therapist,” I raised my head to see Cosmic Karen standing over me.

“Yes, ma’am,” I replied as I got up to walk towards the white wall with the door labeled, “Mrs. Ava's office.”

I walked into the oddly comfortable room with a couch and a table. I slowly closed the door behind me. There was a computer screen with a straight red line. 

I sat on the couch and faced the screen. The walls were a different color, the walls were covered in rainbows, and cute animal cartoons. Am I in some kind of child playroom?

“Hello, Mr. Thomas, my name is Mrs. Aza,” a sweet robotic voice emitted from the screen. 

The red line moved to the resonance of the voice.

“This is a safe space, you're allowed to cry in here and you are allowed to express yourself however you like. I want you to be comfortable. You are allowed to even curse. Nothing leaves this room.”

“What the hell is going on?” I asked the screen.

“Well, I looked through your background, and I see somebody who needs some morale support,” Mrs. Aza explained, “sometimes antisocial tendencies come from unresolved emotional pain due to childhood drama. I want to help you.”

“What?”

“I saw that you loved cookies as a child, so I baked you some,” Mrs. Aza said as cookies magically appeared on the table, “I understand, please tell me how you feel.”

“I feel like I'm going insane!” I screamed, “where the hell am I!? What the shit ass balls is this!?”

“Good, good, Mr. Thomas, screaming is always healthier than getting physical,” Mrs. Aza lectured sweetly, “this room is a safe space and sound proof.”

I grabbed the pillow on the couch and started screaming in it. I started breathing heavily as my face turned red. My face in my palms as I started to sweat.

“I understand, dear, I used to have antisocial tendencies too, I was at one point a blind, idiot who destroyed everything. My sons even left me,” Mrs. Aza said, “when I came to my senses. I saw the destruction of space and time. I felt really bad.”

“What did you do to fix it?” I asked as I slowly raised my head from my palms.

“I decided to get a PhD in psychology and become a licensed therapist,” she explained, “ I wanted to dedicate myself to helping others that were destroyed and destroyed around them. Help people become better versions of themselves.”

“By the way, Mrs. Aza, don't say that about yourself that you were blind or stupid because I think you're a very sweet intelligent person,” I told the screen.

“Aww! Thank you, dear! I'm rooting for you!” She replied.

“You welcome, I'm just not ready to confront these heavy emotions,” I said.

“That's ok, I will always be here when you're ready.”

“I would like to see you, I know you are not the screen,” I said.

“Well… I am sorry, Mr. Thomas,” Mrs. Aza replied softly, “if I show you my true form, then you might have a mental breakdown, or fall into a deep coma or psychosis. It's a safety hazard. It's counterproductive to what I want to do, which is to help others.”

“Ok, I understand, please don't call me Mr. Thomas, call me Sammy,” I told her.

“Of course, Sammy, it was a pleasure to meet you,” she said in the sweetest voice, “it's ok for you to leave, I will give you the full time.”

“Thank you, I'm gonna get a cookie,” I said.

I took a chocolate chip cookie and took a bite; this was the only normal thing in this crazy office. The cookie was delicious beyond belief, total heaven in my mouth, I was shocked by how good the cookie was. The cookie was perfectly crispy, the ratio of chocolate chip, and dough was well-balanced as all things should be. 

Even though the cookie was perfectly crispy, the middle oozed with chocolate lava goodness. For the first time in my life, I cried, I sobbed right in front of the screen. The cookie overwhelmed me, I could not believe a cookie could be that delicious. A box of tissues magically came floating towards me. I wiped my tears and blew my nose into a tissue.

“Oh, sweetheart, you are perfectly fine to cry in this safe space,” Mrs. Aza said through the screen with kindest cadence.

“Mrs. Aza, these cookies… are incredible,” I slowly admitted.

“Dear, thank you so much, I bake everything with love, sadly my sons don’t visit me anymore,” she solemnly replied, “I wish they would visit, so they can try my cookies.”

“Your sons need to appreciate you more, they are not nice to their sweet mother,” I defiantly said while shaking my head, “Where are they even? What’s more important than their own mother?”

“Well…”

“Well, what?” I asked.

“They are mostly going around universes assimilating planets, causing chaos, disorder, and corruption,” she awkwardly admitted, “but they are good boys. I will always have them in my heart.”

“Oh,” I replied, “I guess I’ll be going, thank you, Mrs. Aza.”

“I hope you come back and I will give your full time to HR,” she responded.

I walked out the door and closed it softly behind me. I turned and was jump scared by Cosmic Karen. I jumped back in horror at the rings above her head, the constant blue eyes phasing in, and out. She had a huge toothy grin as she stared at me with wide eyes. Even the blue eye on her forehead stared at me wide eyed.

“How was it?” she asked.

“Good, ma’am,” I insecurely said while looking down.

“Fantastic!” she flew away back to her office.

I walked back to my desk and was met with another massive pile of paperwork that stretched to the ethereal ceiling that may or may not exist. There were now two massive piles of papers, documents, and folders of illogical garbage in front of me. 

I forgot where I was for a second in Mrs. Aza’s office. I forgot I was in the worst horror imaginable, a shitty, boring never-ending job. I didn’t even apply for this! 

I am a hitman, former navy seal, but now I’m doing endless modules and signing unrecognizable forms. The withdrawal symptoms were nasty, and I feel sick 24/7. I was pouring sweat, irritable, headaches, pain, and aches. I felt as though I was on the edge of madness.

I decided that I will try to finish these modules and paperwork, so I can return home. I will claim my money, and I will become victorious. I got to work, the hours turned to days, the days turned to weeks, then months, and…. I still have 100,000 modules to complete. Out of nowhere, 20 more paper piles appeared. 

The only reason why I know it has been months is because of my phone and the computer. Strangely enough, unlike most horror stories, I have wifi, internet connection, access to the outside world digitally, and I can charge my phone.

 It doesn’t matter, I’m trapped, the address doesn’t exist, it’s some bullshit like 0001111999 North Bollywood New York City Drive with the zip code of 667. 667, they just added one number, so I don’t even get anything actually scary. I don't even get demons. I get something worse than demons, paperwork, forms, red tape, Cosmic Karen, and Major Tom. 

Red tape, I can't do this, I can't do that, or I get called to Cosmic Karen's office.  She scolds me, then sends me back with more forms to sign, emails to send, and threats of being written up. I decided to not clock in or click out to see what happens. I got clocked out/in anyways no matter what.

“Good morning!” Major Tom announced.

“Have a good night!” Major Tom announced.

Over and over and over and over and over……

No one tells me the rules to follow; they just tell me to read the employee handbook. I flipped through the employee handbook which was in my drawer. From what I saw, the employee handbook just read, “rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, guidelines, guidelines, guidelines, etc.”

The words on pages finally change after the 10th page. The handbook started to say, “All work and no play make Sammy a dull boy.”

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

Over and over and over and over again.

I stared at the pages with terror while the lights dimmed in the office. I looked up and saw Major Tom working normally. He doesn't care nor notice the light dimming.

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

**All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.**

I kept reading the handbook as the lights started to flicker.

“It's always good to read the employee handbook,” the happy voice of Major Tom penetrates my ear drum.

I looked up and jumped back out of my seat and fell to the ground. Major Toms looked down at me with a crack to the sides of his fishbowl helmet. A bullet wound in his head that squirted blood. A pool of blood collects at the bottom of the fishbowl. 

Major Tom smiles with no worries in the world. I run through all the smiling Major Toms that aimlessly type on their keyboards. The light flickers overhead and the blood continuously pools in their helmets. The gunshot wound to the side of all of the Major Tom heads squirts blood.

“Hey, buddy,” they all say in unison as I sprint through them, “the weatherman predicts rainfall this afternoon. Don't forget an umbrella.”

“Oh fudge! I forgot my umbrella,” all Major Tom's said in unison. 

I finally made it to the bathroom and slammed the door shut. How long have I truly been in the office space? Where was I? What the hell is going on?

I texted my girlfriend:

*Me: Baby! Is everything ok? I'm trying to escape.*

*Me: Can you send me a selfie!? A nude!?*

*Me: the office space never ends! The paperwork never STOPS! THE MODULES GO ON FOREVER!*

*Me: that dumb fishbowl headed fuck won't stop talking about the WEATHER! FUCK THE WEATHER!*

*Me: The only decent one is Mrs. Aza!*

*Me: why do they talk so much about the weather!? THERE IS NO WEATHER IN HERE!*

*Me: what do WE EVEN WORK ON!!!!????*

*Me: Blood is pooling in the fucking weirdo's helmet. How does he not notice?*

I was left on read, so I waited, but nothing. I called her and her phone rang for a while. I called her again, but she still didn’t answer. I called another time, but nothing. I sat on the toilet as I desperately read the text messages and called her. I called her multiple times and she finally answered.

“Hey, baby, I am trying to escape,” I said, “I will be out.”

“I’m breaking up with you,” she suddenly yelped.

“What!? But…but I’m almost out!” I shouted into the phone.

“Yeah, well I talked to my girlfriend and my mom. They are right. You are a really toxic influence on me,” she muttered awkwardly to me, “I got clean. I’m seeing someone else.”

“What!? What the fuck!? Who’s this guy!”

“He’s an accountant and he’s really nice,” she replied, “we are finished.”

“Hahaha, I’d like to meet this guy!” I laughed like a maniac, “Once I get out! I’ll fucking find you!”

“Stay in your fucking office, asshole!” she screamed.

“I’m gett-” 

She hung up on me.

“Fuck! Shit! Ass!” I screamed as I threw my phone to the ground.

*Knock! Knock! Knock!*

“Hey, anyone in there,” Major Tom said as he continued to knock, “I gotta drop the kids off at the pool, if you know what I mean.”

I started to scream like a madman as Major Tom knocked and told dad jokes. I started bashing my head against the wall as the knocking continued nonstop. My blood started trickling down my head and face, but the knocking didn’t stop.

*Knock! Knock! Knock!*

“Anyone in there, I need to use the little boy's room,” Major Tom said.

I opened the door and there he was, his stupid ugly fishbowl, but this time, the blood pooled all the way to the top. The entire fishbowl on his head was full to the brim with blood, but he was talking normally to me a second ago. He shouldn’t be able to talk, instead he should be drowning in the blood. This place makes no sense!

“Hey, buddy, you ok? You are always in the bathroom. Do you have any gastrointestinal problems?” he asked, though his fishbowl was full of blood.

I angrily pushed him to the ground as I furiously ran to my desk. I passed countless Major Toms with blood pooled to the top of their fishbowl helmets as the lights flickered overhead. I was shaking intensely, my hands shook, my head hurt, and my nose was stuffy. My heart went to the speed of light; it was relentlessly pounding.

I haven’t taken anything in months, so I sat there as I stared at the monitor. I saw millions of emails, so I started punching the screen, my fist was slashed by the glass of the monitor. I felt extreme pain in my hand as the blood dripped to the ground.

I looked up, I saw the paper pile, and I pushed it to the ground. The massive endless paper pile fell and collided with the Major Toms as it crashed to the ground. The office kept going and going, so the paper pile laid on the ground in the endless office. Papers covered the entire office, but the Major Toms didn’t care, all they did was smile and type their lives away. I looked through my drawers to find something to help me end this madness.

There were a pair of *scissors* laying at the bottom of the draw. 

I had the greatest idea; I am going to start stabbing Major Toms. I got up and scanned the ocean of Major Toms that kept going to infinity. Their helmets were a thick dark red with blood spilling to the ground from the cracked hole to the side. 

I blinked and all the Major Toms went back to normal. The lights overhead went from the flickering between dark and light to just bright. The brightness of the office always gave me a nasty headache.

“Hey, don’t run with scissors,” Major Tom casually said as he walked over to my desk.

I rushed him to get a headstart on my stabbing spree. I started stabbing him repeatedly in the abdomen and chest. He fell to the ground with a dumb smile plastered to his face. I stabbed another one as he typed on his computer and he fell face first into his keyboard. At this point, my suit was stained with blood from the one I hate the most. 

I stabbed another Major Tom who poured coffee into his dumb tube that he drank from. I stabbed him right in the heart. Then, I stabbed another in the heart, and I continued to run throughout the infinity office. I stabbed and stabbed more and more Major Toms. Now, I was drenched with blood, I shanked another Major Tom repeatedly.

“Hahahahahaha!” I started laughing as stabbed yet another one, “Fuck you! I hate all your jokes!”

I looked back and saw a bunch of dead Major Toms scattered through the office. I felt proud of myself at that moment, but there were more, a lot more. There was an ocean of them right in front of me. One Major Tom got up and walked towards me casually.

“Why the long face?” he casually asked as he got up from his desk.

“You are gonna need a laundromat to clean your suit,” another Major Tom said as he looked towards me from his cubicle, “got a guy, his name is Major Tom.”

“Oh, yeah, Major Tom is really great with tough stains,” another Major Tom answered.

I dropped the scissors and started screaming as I lunged towards the Major Tom that stood in front of me. I started punching his fishbowl repeatedly, but my knuckles started to hurt immensely. 

My knuckles probably broke at that moment as I continued to punch. The injury is called a boxers fracture which is a common fracture with MMA fighters and boxers. My fist went through the fishbowl and the glass sliced through my fist. 

My fist connected to his face and it was so satisfying. My wrist started to bleed heavily as the blood poured out of my open vein from the shards of glass. My wrist was sliced open by the glass. 

I continued to pummel him with the broken sliced hand.  I started to lose consciousness from the blood loss. I eventually passed out as I fell over on top of him.

“Yeah, it was a *super busy day,* it can be tough when you’re new,” Major Tom said underneath me, “I’m tired too, maybe we need a cup of sloppy joe.”

“You are right Major Tom!” Major Tom exclaimed, “I’ll brew some coffee.”

I faded away into unconsciousness as I heard Major Toms talk about coffee, the weather, the job, and sports. I woke up in a seat in front of Cosmic Karen’s desk as she types on her computer. The room was bright white that seemed to blind anybody that walked in and impossibly clean. My suit was back to being cleaner than a whistle as though the blood never existed. My face was in pain, a lot of pain, due to a constant smile that forced upon it. 

I assumed that while I was unconscious; my face had a forced plastered on plastic smile. My upper back was starting to hurt as though I sat straight up for several hours. While I was asleep, I was propped up in this seat for hours and hours. My hands were on my lap and there were no wounds. 

My wrists and hands were perfectly fine. My upper back and face hurt more than my hands. Cosmic Karen turned her head to face me as she uncrossed her legs. Her face was angry and sour as she glared straight at me with her ethereal blue eye focused upon me.

“Mr. Thomas,” she hissed with a thousand voices, “your little stunt earlier backed up our schedule. We now have to work overtime and through lunch. The creator is not too happy with that. Not only that, but he had to step in to file some paperwork, do an inspection, and help us clean up. You know how much he hates paperwork.”

“I apologize, Mrs. Karen,” I replied with a painful grin, “I will make sure it never happens again.”

“I’m sorry, but we had to escalate it, and you have been written up yet again. Your *type* has always been a problem. Never wants to work honestly, always breaks the rules, and always has an attitude,” Cosmic Karen lectured, “I have had many of you come in and your *type* is always a nuisance.”

“Excuse me, Ma’am, but if you dislike my work so much, then why hire me?” I asked with forced politeness.

“Because there was a complaint and you needed to be corrected. Earthly correction doesn’t work with men like you,” she replied in a serious tone with a straight face, “sometimes *sinners* like you need to be introduced to something more.”

“Mrs. Karen, I… fu…freaking….h…a... hate it here,” I struggled to utter, “I’m not meant to be here.”

“Actually, you are meant to be here,” she replied while cocking her head to the side, “one more time you get into trouble. We will have to how dare I say it, let you go.”

“Yes, Mrs. Karen, but I want to be let go, I want to quit,” I said as I gritted my teeth through the smile.

“You want to quit? Hahahahaha,” she started laughing hard and cocked her head back to face the ceiling, “No, you don’t want to quit, you’ll end up in the unemployment zone.”

“Yes, I do Mrs. Kkkarren, I cannot stand it anymore,” I muttered, “please let me go.”

My eye started to twitch violently from the lack of sleep and my head was now starting to hurt real bad. I felt like some bashed my head repeatedly against the wall. My eyes were also strained from the constant white bright lights. There is a form of torture called the white room where they throw you in solitary confinement in white room. 

The entire room is white, the bed, the sink, even the food, and the drinks are white. This form of psychological torture is meant to induce headaches and extreme sensory deprivation. The entire office has bright lights and whiteness that covers everything. The only color is the suits that we wore, but we all wore the same suits. I wore the same-colored suit as Major Toms which was a grey suit. 

Mrs. Karen wore a grey pantsuit as she got up from her desk and walked to the other side of the desk. She played with my hair and started to pull it which jarred my head back. I couldn’t move out of the position that I was in. 

She poked my face with her long chrome nails that drew blood. She was close to me as she poked me and played with my hair. She stood directly over me and looked down on me with a large grin. 

The blue pulsating eye in the middle of her forehead was reading me like a book. I got to see the ever shifting blue eyes that phased in and out of her sickly white skin. I had an up close, personal view of her, and all her features including her rings that never stop spinning. 

I should’ve been repulsed, but I was infatuated with her as the beautiful angel that she was. At that moment, I realized that a demon would’ve been better. This woman was beyond any monster or demon, she was an Ophanim.

“You want to be let go? There is no fun in that!” she admitted with a menacing smile, “I like playing with cute boys like you because what breaks men like you is fascinating. The mundane, the normal, and having your freedoms taken away is what breaks you. Men like you are obsessed with power. It’s fun to take that away.”

“Yes! Ma’am!” I exclaimed with a cramping tensed up jaw, “I cannot take it anymore.”

“You can’t quit because this is not a normal job. I mean, you can, but that’s a bad idea,” she responded as she sat behind her glass desk, “I know that you want more. You want to kill me and Major Tom. That’s all you do. That's what you are good at. You can’t just quit. You need revenge.”

“Excuse me, Mrs. Karen, may I ask a question?” I asked as I slowly struggled to raise my shaking arms.

“Yes.”

“Who made the complaint?” I said as my entire body cramped up as I tried to move it.

“You are not authorized to know that” she replied with a straight face, “all I have to say is, your little game of life and death upset the one who made the complaint. He doesn’t like the unnecessary paperwork that death brings.”

“Th…th…the cr…eator,” I muttered as my head shook furiously.

I forced my cramping body to move as I leaped over her desk to strangle her. I managed to get on top of her and wrapped my fingers around her throat. I squeezed as hard as I could, so I could snuff her life out, and she struggled against me. My weight and strength overpowered her as she clawed at me with her chrome nails. 

The cold white skin of her throat was under my grasp. I held on like I was hanging from a cliff, but then, she snapped her finger. The golden rings above started spinning much faster. I started to light on fire, I felt my skin melt from the heat, but I never let go. I was the victor in that moment and I started to laugh through the intense heat.

“Hahaha, I will win! You biiii….tttt……chchch! I’m sorry Mrs. Karen! It won’t happen again, Ma’am!” I screamed as I choked her.

Finally, she went limp and she stopped breathing as her head fell back. The golden rings fell to the ground, but the blue eyes continued to shift on her skin. The fire disappeared and my body was back to normal. I was the victor! I was the winner!

“Yes! Yes! I win! I defeated that wench! I will go back to the-”

Suddenly, I was interrupted and thrusted back into the seat with a smile. My back straight and my hands on my lap. My suit had no wrinkles, my face was clean shaven, and my eyes stared straight at her. She stared at me with an angry snarl, the blue eye on her forehead glared at me with intensity, and she cocked her head to the side.

“Had fun? I’m gonna have to write you up a third time for your little outburst,” she said after a long tense silence.

“Mrs. Karen, do you enjoy this?” I asked in a gleeful way, “My suffering.”

“Yes, I do, I love breaking the minds of men like you,” she sternly answered.

“May I ask why?”

“Because men like you deserve to have your lives taken away, but in a different way,” she responded, “I can’t just kill you, though you deserve it. The creator forbids that, so I have come up with spaces that perfectly break the mind.”

“Men...men… li…ke…me,” I stuttered.

“Yes, sinners, sinners that play with death. A former hitman forced into an office space and is forced to work a grueling unforgiving job. I find that funny,” she hissed with hatred, “Major Tom does all the paperwork, answers the email, and runs errands for the Creator. You took a job to kill him like all the others. All the others had to spend time here like you.”

I sat there with the burning pain of the forced grin on my face. I couldn’t move no matter how hard I tried. I had no choice, but to listen to her, I wasn’t even allowed to talk at that moment.

“Your life, your freedom, and your power has been stripped from you,” she lectured, “Anyways, I dislike that I have to do this, but I have to…”

She took a deep breath as she moaned and sighed before she started to talk again.

“I’m gonna have to let you go.”

I opened my eyes, and I was in my bed in my house. I heard the birds chirping outside, I checked the time, and it was 9 AM. I jumped out of my bed and saw I was back in my assassins gear. I started to dance and jump around in joy.

“I’m free! I’m free!” I cried out as I started to dance.

I frantically called my girlfriend to tell her the good news, and she answered.

“I’m free from the office!” I cried into the phone.

“I’m done with you! You asshole!” she screamed into the phone and hung up.

She was gonna come back to me, we’ve had a lot of fights, and she always comes back. I wanted to run outside and finally get some fresh air. I ran to the front door, turned the knob, and pushed it forward.

Pitch black, I opened the door and it was pitch black. I walked outside, there was a pitch black ground, but there was nothing. I walked outside for a few minutes and saw only darkness. I walked back to my house, closed the door, and locked it. I looked out the window to make sure and there was an endless sea of blackness. 

I sat on the couch and started to cry, so this is what Mrs. Karen meant by unemployment zone. I opened my laptop and started to look for a job on various job searching websites. I had a criminal record, so looking for employment is going to be hard. 

Luckily, there were jobs in other dimensions, universes, and realities. There were literally infinite job listings on the websites. As I waited for interviews and call backs; I decided to write this story to you guys.

It took me a few years and many awkward interviews. I had an interview with a jellyfish, grey men in suits, men in black, a starfish, a sea sponge, a crab that didn’t want to pay minimum wage, etc. I also had many normal interviews, but they didn’t like my background. 

So, I ended up being a cashier at this fast-food place in dimension 5150. All of my customers have been ghosts, no literally, they are all ghosts. They look like stereotypical ghosts like they have white bed sheets on their heads and googly eyes.

1pv2w0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Bloiter/comments/1pv2w0t/codeine_withdrawal_timeline/,Codeine Withdrawal Timeline,"Just found this in my notes from a while ago, thought I’d share just incase anyone maybe enduring codeine withdrawal at the moment.

This isn’t a complete timeline that I’ve documented and I left it unfinished as my withdrawals seemed to disappear rather quickly compared to other times I have experienced them, I have also endured way worse than what I’ve described but just use this as reference for what to expect.

(I also didn’t obtain the codeine through your traditional medical sources, therefore I was coming very high doses. I’ll leave the rest to your imagination.)

12 hours:

- Still feel the effects moderately, sense of strong relaxation and the feeling of just being able to lay down and chill almost anywhere.
- My energy levels feel high but low at the same time, as in, I have the motivation to be productive with gym etc. but I physically feel less able and weak.
- Constantly tired, not to the point where I can’t keep my eyes open but to a level where if I wilfully want to sleep, I can sleep at anytime.
- About to head to the gym now, will update after.

18 hours:

- The workout was fine for the most part, I wasn’t physically limited by any means but after a set I would definitely feel dizzy and lightheaded. 
- I had also read that apparently when coming off codeine some of it gets stored in your fat and when burning fat through exercise the remnants of codeine get released back in to the bloodstream so this could explain today’s session.
- It is now 8PM and I feel immensely exhausted, fatigued and tired I can fall asleep at any moment but I’m actively fighting it off so I don’t ruin my sleeping pattern.
- Other than exhaustion, tiredness and a false sense of weakness not much symptoms have shown today.
- However, this isn’t my first rodeo and I know the next few days to come will get progressively worse.
- Just to add, occasionally my eyes seem to get quite red, squinted and shiny.

Day 1:

- Woke up with about 9 hours of sleep, initially after waking up I felt very sleepy still and could go back to bed but I got up forcefully and continued my morning.
- Feel fine now after a coffee, small breakfast and some chill time
- Going to head to the gym now, overall feeling pretty normal right now the intense relaxation has gone and I feel quite energised.
-  There are still some minimal visual effects like slight bur and sharpness.
- Overall feel fine going to workout.
- 8PM now workout was fine as usual.
- No symptoms felt yet really other than the drowsiness and tiredness, which has lessened since yesterday.
- I don’t expect to go through any hard obstacles yet until at least the 3rd day.

Day 2:

- Just woke up for work, it’s 6AM
- Already I can feel the depression and that existential dread kicking in.
- I’ve gone through this codeine depression before but from a much more severe dose and it is not fun at all.
- Got to try and keep my mental strong now.
- 8AM and the depression is really kicking in now. Tears in my eyes as I’m writing this, I know it’s just the withdrawals but the sadness really does feel real. Just thinking back on life and my current position in life at the moment.
- After the whole morning fiasco, I think my hormones were just unbalanced or something as I read that opiates significantly affect testosterone.
- I was pretty much fine after the morning, my symptoms seemed to have disappeared for the remainder of the day, or at least be unnoticeable.

Day 3:

- Just woke up, feel as if I am back to normal feeling no more symptoms as of yet, we’ll see how the day progresses.
- I forgot to mention that constipation is a big symptom to note all the way from day one which I left out by accident. 
- I’ve been taking a laxative to combat this, but yeah definitely watch out for the constipation.

I need someone to tell me if I should text a girls from my school or not, given the things she said to me and our conversations. Its been quite an long time since someone has shown that they find me interesting so my ability to understand and read hints from girls is quite rusty.

So theres this girl from my School and we had some conversations together in class about different things like Hobbys and school and stuff like that. She is quite mature compared to other women I've talked to. I'm also quite mature for our age (18) compared to other men in my school. Therefore we had quite a good conversation and we liked each other or at least I think so because she gives the vibes that she wants someone a little more mature and grown up like she is.
A few weeks later I had a presentation in the class where she is aswell. After that she complemented me about it and said it was really good. Nothing too fancy yet but the week later she talked to me again asking me if I already got my grade and complemented me again for the presentation, telling me and I quote ""That was so good, you should do a podcast or something I really like your voice and the way you talk. I didn't want it to end"" (translated from German).
Now I don't know If she just said that because she is mature and grown up and it's just the way she talks and complements and for her it's not something special. For me it was really something special and now I was wondering after we gave each other some smiles the following days if I should text her.
Maybe start of by telling her the grade for the presentation and beginning the conversation like that because she was interested and then later asking her out for a coffee or something. 

Thanks in advance for anyone giving advice and please excuse my grammar and spelling English is not my mother tongue and I wrote this on a phone",1,1766628309.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

This should be obvious, but we need to side with our Asian brothers and sisters against the neo-colonial, Anglo rapists (economic and literal). We need to wake up and realize that America is at war with the entire Asian population: home countries and the diaspora alike. American society doesn't even bother concealing it in the slightest. Its institutions ethnically cleanse the diaspora from top schools and employment opportunities, while its politicians and favored criminals carry out stochastic pogroms on its city streets. Back in our home countries, America sends its worst rapists and vehicular child-killers to subjugate its colonies, all while stirring up Sinophobia propped up by thinly veiled white supremacy.

Here's how I am responding and how I encourage others to respond: support Asian-owned businesses in any way possible. Stop giving your money to neo-colonial rapists who are trying to exterminate us. **STOP. GIVING. YOUR. MONEY. TO. PEOPLE. TRYING. TO. EXTERMINATE. US.** This means to stop attending American sporting events or watching the NFL/NBA/NHL, stop watching non-Asian shows on television/streaming services. Better yet, cancel your Amazon/Netflix/Apple subscriptions. Don't buy a fucking Tesla or other American EV. (Replace it with Hyundai or a Chinese/Vietnamese EV if you can get one.)

**Here's how this looks in my life:** My phone is Samsung. My computer is Asus, with AMD\* and NVIDIA\* chips. I use DoorDash\*, Chowbus\*, or Weee!\* for food and grocery delivery. For beverages, I choose among [Sans](https://doyousans.com/)\*, [Sool](https://www.drinksool.com/)\*, [Sanzo](https://drinksanzo.com/)\*, [Hummy](https://www.drinkhummy.com/)\*, [Dokkaebier](https://www.enjoydkb.com/)\*, [Lunar](https://www.drinklunar.com/)\*, [Twrl Milk Tea](https://twrl.com/)\*, and others.

I rely on [Blueland](https://www.blueland.com/)\* for all household cleaning products. I use [Monos](https://monos.com/)\* luggage.

I don't even like/have much use for some of these (never managed to sync up with TikTok's algorithm, for example). But I still support them because they're an Asian-founded company.

I also moved overseas to avoid tariffs and encourage Asian Americans to reduce spending as much as possible until you can do the same.

**Tl;dr:** America has been trying to exterminate Asians globally for decades, and we should really stop funding our would-be killers.

So I wanted to give a little bit of context. 2025 was a crazy year. Didn’t enjoy my old job. Went on a four months sabbatical. Traveled across Southeast Asia in Japan for three months. Came back to that same working environment, which got even worse so I ended up quitting with no job. Had two months of stress and anxiety lol. BUT I secured luckily a fully remote job. It has a work abroad program for 1 to 2 months and 25 days of vacation.

I really wanna make this work because it’s basically what I wanted, especially after coming home from traveling. That experience changed my entire outlook of life and now I don’t really care about going up to corporate ladder. I want to buy myself something that’s more important. Time and freedom so I can work on myself, go to the gym, and build good habits, meet people and have more novelty in my day-to-day environment and hopefully get the opportunity to travel and work abroad or just travel a lot more often.

For those doing remote work any recommendations of how you made your day-to-day more enjoyable with the extra freedom? Did you work from different places (i.e. A coffee shop, community center, coworker space, etc.)?

How did you continue to keep your social bug up? Of course, the one downside of the remote is that you end up not talking to anyone as much in person. Although I’ve never really cared of connecting with my coworkers that closely anyways. But I do want to start joining meet ups or just striking conversations with random people at coffee, shops, or coworker spots. Any recommendations there?

For those working remote, does your company also have a work abroad program? If so, have you taken advantage of it? How was that experience? Any countries that you would recommend?

Any other useful tips would be great! 2026 is gonna be a year where I have a lot more freedom now and even though I won’t be on a three months sabbatical anytime soon I want to create a novelty every few months to make my life as exciting and interesting as possible!",0,1766628135.0,remotework,1,0.33,False

Now I’m torn and would love some perspective from people who’ve done either or both. 

Option A: Spend 2ish weeks in Hawaii (BI 1st week, 2nd week?)

Option B: Do \~1 week in Hawaii and then \~1 week in Mexico City

A little about me and what I’m looking for:

• I love nature, hiking, beaches, and exploring

• I also really enjoy food, culture, walkable cities, coffee, beer, mezcal, and museums

• I’m traveling solo and want a good balance of adventure + downtime

• January timeframe

Things I’m hoping to get advice on:

• Would two weeks in Hawaii feel immersive or repetitive?

• Is splitting the trip too rushed, or actually the best of both worlds?

• For Hawaii specifically, better to slow travel one island, or island-hop?

• Any January-specific considerations (weather, crowds, costs)?

I’m not looking for a “perfect itinerary,” more of a what would you do and why perspective.

Appreciate any insight, especially from people who’ve done 2+ week stays in Hawaii or combined it with a city trip like CDMX.

In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Elliot Reed sat cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by paper.

Not scattered—**arranged**.

Missing persons reports covered the carpet like fallen leaves. Jack. Mike. John. Leo Hawkins. Marcus Hawkins. Sarah. Evan. Each with dates, locations, and one shared note written in the margins:

**MENTIONED A CARTOON.**

Elliot circled two names harder than the rest.

LEO HAWKINS  
MARCUS HAWKINS

Brothers.

Same last name.

Different outcomes.

Leo institutionalized after committing multiple violent crimes, repeating the same phrase during every arrest:

>

Marcus—never found.

Elliot leaned back against the couch, rubbing his eyes.

“Two brothers don’t break the same way unless something broke them first,” he muttered.

He opened a new tab.

ASHER HAWKINS.

# THE HOUSE

Asher Hawkins lived in a quiet neighborhood.

Too quiet.

The kind of street where wind moved trees but nothing else moved at all. No kids. No dogs. No decorations. Just houses pretending to be normal.

Asher’s home sat at the end of the block.

Lights on.

Curtains open.

Like he was waiting.

Elliot parked and sat for a moment, watching the house.

Then he grabbed his notebook and stepped out into the cold.

# ASHER HAWKINS

Asher answered the door before Elliot could knock.

He smiled.

Not wide.

Not forced.

Just… ready.

“You’re here about my boys,” Asher said.

Elliot froze.

“…Yes,” he replied carefully. “How did you—”

Asher stepped aside.

“Come in.”

The house smelled like old paper and coffee.

Family photos lined the hallway.

Leo and Marcus as kids—laughing by a fireplace. Missing teeth. Cartoon drawings taped to the wall behind them.

Elliot slowed his steps.

“What did you do for work, Mr. Hawkins?” he asked.

Asher’s smile twitched.

“I made things people watched.”

# THE DRAWINGS

Asher led Elliot into a study.

The desk was clean—but the shelves were not.

Sketchbooks filled every inch.

Asher picked one up and flipped it open.

Black-and-white drawings.

A smiling cartoon figure.

White eyes.

A top hat.

A cane.

Elliot’s throat tightened.

“You drew this?” he asked.

Asher nodded proudly.

“He used to make people happy.”

*Used to*, Elliot noticed.

“When?” Elliot asked.

Asher looked at the drawings longer than necessary.

“Before people forgot.”

# LEO AND MARCUS

“They loved him,” Asher continued. “They watched me draw him every night. Leo asked questions. Marcus watched quietly.”

Elliot scribbled notes.

“And when did things change?”

Asher closed the sketchbook.

“When views went down.”

The room felt colder.

“People stopped watching,” Asher said calmly. “Stopped caring. You know what happens to things no one watches, right?”

Elliot didn’t answer.

Asher smiled again.

“My boys noticed before I did.”

# THE BASEMENT DOOR

As Elliot stood to leave, he noticed something.

A door.

At the end of the hallway.

Painted over multiple times.

Scratches around the frame.

“Basement?” Elliot asked.

Asher’s voice stayed calm.

“Yes.”

A pause.

“Just storage.”

From somewhere beneath the house—

A soft *thump*.

Once.

Elliot didn’t flinch.

“Did Leo ever talk about the basement?” he asked.

Asher met his eyes.

“No.”

The thump came again.

Louder.

Asher spoke over it.

“They forgot my cartoon,” he said softly. “But my boys didn’t.”

# LEAVING

As Elliot stepped outside, his phone buzzed.

A new voicemail.

Static.

Then breathing.

Then a faint, cheerful voice buried under distortion:

Cardio Slim Tea is a comprehensive cardiovascular support blend featuring 15 heart-healthy ingredients including beetroot, hawthorn, TMG, and hibiscus that work together to support healthy blood pressure, optimize homocysteine levels, provide decent antioxidant protection.

All in all this also offers gentle metabolic enhancement—though I won’t call it a dramatic weight loss solution and that is after it requires consistency over like 8-12 weeks combined with proper diet and exercise to see some meaningful results.

What I like is the gentle, ***non-habit-forming formula***, very different from harsh laxatives (that you get in those obnoxious detox teas lol), premium manufacturing standards, and science-backed ingredients targeting multiple cardiovascular & heart health pathways.

Overall, I'd rate this tea a solid 4.2 out of 5 stars for those prioritizing heart health and long-term wellness over quick-fix weight loss.

I recommend [**getting this only from official website**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/cardioslim.php), there are counterfeit versions floating around on platforms like Amazon.

Over the years, I've tried countless ***herbal teas*** promising everything from weight loss to better sleep. I've experimented with everything from traditional green teas to exotic blends featuring ashwagandha, ginseng, and various Ayurvedic formulations.

So I've kind of learned to distinguish between gimmicky products loaded with laxatives and genuinely beneficial formulations designed for long-term wellness. When I came across Cardio Slim Tea, I was immediately interested in its heart health & blood pressure support focus—something I don't see emphasized enough in the wellness tea market.

If you are someone who's researched tea ingredients extensively like I have, you'll appreciate that Cardio Slim Tea takes a fundamentally different approach than most ""slim"" teas flooding the market.

This isn't another senna-laden detox disaster waiting to happen. Instead, it's a thoughtfully formulated blend targeting heart health, homocysteine optimization, and gentle metabolic support through 15 carefully selected ingredients.

 

**My overall rating: 4.2/5**

* Gradual improvement with consistent use—realistic rather than false promises

**Overall Scientific Foundation: 4.2/5**

* Nearly every ingredient has peer-reviewed research supporting benefits
* Multi-targeted approach reflects genuine cardiovascular wellness understanding

 

# What Makes Cardio Slim Tea Different From Other Weight Loss Teas

From my first-hand experience with various weight management teas, I can tell you that most products in this category are essentially glorified laxatives.

They create the illusion of weight loss through dehydration and frequent bathroom trips, not actual fat reduction or metabolic improvement. If you're looking for sustainable health benefits rather than temporary water weight loss, this distinction matters enormously.

Cardio Slim Tea stands apart because it completely *avoids* harsh stimulant laxatives like ***senna, cassia, or malva***—ingredients that dominate competitors like 3 Ballerina Tea, Fit Tea, SkinnyBoost Detox teas etc..

Instead, this blend focuses more on heart health , antioxidant protection, and gentle weight loss/metabolic optimization. The absence of artificial chemicals, toxins, or aggressive stimulants means you're not risking dependency or the uncomfortable side effects I've experienced with other weight loss & detox teas.

**My Overall Rating: 4.2 Out of 5 Stars**

 

**What Earns It 4.2 Stars**: The thoughtful, cardiovascular-focused ingredient selection sets this apart from gimmicky detox teas. The absence of harsh laxatives makes it safe for long-term use. 

The multi-ingredient synergy targets heart health from multiple angles—blood pressure support, homocysteine optimization, antioxidant protection, and gentle metabolic enhancement. The manufacturing standards (FDA-registered, GMP-certified, third-party testing) provide quality assurance that's often missing in the tea market.

**Why Not a Perfect 5**: The lack of ingredient dosage transparency prevents me from giving it a full 5 stars. Additionally, while the formula is excellent, the ""Slim"" marketing might create unrealistic weight loss expectations—this is fundamentally a cardiovascular support tea that may assist with weight management, not a dramatic weight loss solution. The potential for medication interactions, while common with bioactive ingredients, also requires caution that some users might overlook.

# My experience with Cardio Slim Tea (and what you can expect too)



**Week 1: Adjustment & First Impressions**

* Taste is pleasant but takes 2-3 days to adjust to the herbal blend
* Mild energy lift without jitters—noticeable difference from coffee
* Slight bloating reduction, likely from dandelion's gentle diuretic effect
* Sleep quality improved when drinking evening cup (chamomile effect)
* No dramatic changes yet, which is realistic and expected

**Week 2: Subtle Shifts Begin**

* Digestive comfort noticeably better, less post-meal bloating
* Energy feels more consistent throughout the day
* Down 1-2 lbs, mostly water weight from reduced retention
* Starting to crave the tea as part of daily routine
* Still no miracle results, but feeling slightly lighter

**Week 3: Momentum Building**

* Clothes fitting slightly better around waist
* Blood pressure readings trending lower (if monitoring)
* Feeling less afternoon fatigue—sustained energy is real
* Down 2-3 lbs total, combination of water and slight fat loss
* Noticing I'm reaching for healthier snacks (mindset shift from wellness routine)

**Week 4: Modest but Real Results**

* Total weight loss: 3-5 lbs (realistic for tea support)
* Cardiovascular endurance feels improved during workouts. I feel stronger.
* Skin looks clearer, from antioxidant benefits
* Digestive system running smoothly and predictably
* Overall sense of wellness rather than dramatic transformation

**What Holds It Back from 5 Stars:**

* Results are gradual, not dramatic—patience required
* Still needs diet and exercise for meaningful weight loss
* Some days the taste feels repetitive
* Price point higher than basic teas
* Works best as part of broader health strategy, not standalone solution

# Breaking Down the 15 Heart-Supporting Ingredients

**Beetroot Powder** One of my favorite cardiovascular ingredients. Rich in dietary nitrates that convert to nitric oxide, helping relax blood vessels and support healthy blood pressure. Great for circulation concerns.

**Decaffeinated Green Tea** Preserves beneficial polyphenols and catechins (particularly EGCG) for metabolism and antioxidant protection without the jitters. These powerful antioxidants help decrease inflammation throughout your body.

**Hibiscus Flowers** Underrated and research-backed for supporting healthy blood pressure. Loaded with anthocyanins and antioxidants that benefit your immune system, plus a tart, cranberry-like flavor.

**Ginger Root** Never underestimate ginger's versatility. Beyond digestive benefits, it offers anti-inflammatory properties and supports circulation. Makes this tea more stomach-friendly if you struggle with nausea.

**Oolong Tea** Provides gentle natural caffeine (20-40mg per serving) without the crash. Contains L-theanine for calm focus—why tea is anxiety-safe but coffee often isn't for sensitive individuals.

**Chamomile** Your relaxation ingredient, perfect for evening consumption. Mild sedative properties reduce stress and improve sleep. Combined with L-theanine, it creates balanced energy without overstimulation.

**Dandelion Leaves** A gentle, natural diuretic that helps reduce water retention without harsh pharmaceutical effects. Far gentler than aggressive detox tea diuretics, suitable for regular use.

**Hawthorn Berries** One of the most researched herbs for cardiovascular support. Traditionally used for healthy circulation, blood pressure, and heart function—proof this formula focuses on genuine heart health, not just marketing.

**Lemongrass** Adds pleasant citrus flavor while providing mild diuretic and digestive properties. Rich in antioxidants and may support healthy cholesterol levels.

**TMG (Trimethylglycine/Betaine)** Where this tea gets particularly interesting. Helps optimize homocysteine levels—elevated homocysteine increases cardiovascular risk. Demonstrates genuine attention to heart health biochemistry.

**Grapeseed Extract** One of the most potent antioxidant sources, rich in OPCs that provide powerful vascular protection. Supports healthy blood pressure and circulation.

**Ginseng Root** An adaptogen that helps manage stress while supporting energy and cognitive function. Gentler in tea form than standalone supplements, but monitor your response if you're stimulant-sensitive.

**Curcumin** Turmeric's active compound, celebrated for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Supports cardiovascular health, joint comfort, and overall wellness. Absorption may be enhanced when combined with other tea compounds.

**Cinnamon** Supports healthy blood sugar levels with additional antioxidant benefits. Adds natural sweetness without sugar, making the tea enjoyable unsweetened.

**Monk Fruit** Smart zero-calorie natural sweetener without the bitter aftertaste or health concerns of artificial alternatives. Won't spike blood sugar—naturally sweet tea without guilt.



# How Cardio Slim Tea Compares to Other Heart Health Supplements

**Versus Traditional Heart Health Supplements**

If you're currently taking standalone supplements like ***CoQ10, omega-3s, or resveratrol*** for cardiovascular support, Cardio Slim Tea offers a complementary approach rather than a replacement.

The advantage here is the synergistic effect of multiple ingredients working together in a delivery method your body processes differently than pills.

I've found that liquid/tea forms of nutrients often feel more bioavailable and gentler on the stomach than capsules. The ritual of preparing and drinking tea also encourages mindfulness and stress reduction—factors that independently benefit heart health.

**Versus Other Antioxidant Teas**

Compared to straight ***green tea or matcha,*** Cardio Slim Tea provides broader cardiovascular-specific support through ingredients like hawthorn, TMG, and beetroot that you won't find in traditional teas.

However, if you're solely looking for maximum catechin content for metabolic benefits, a high-quality matcha or concentrated green tea extract might deliver higher doses of those specific compounds.

That said, I would argue that Cardio Slim Tea's comprehensive approach—combining antioxidants with specific cardiovascular support ingredients—makes it more strategically targeted for heart health than generic antioxidant teas.

**Versus Hibiscus-Only or Hawthorn-Only Teas**

Single-ingredient teas like pure hibiscus or hawthorn certainly have their place, and some research suggests impressive cardiovascular benefits from these herbs alone.

However, Cardio Slim Tea's multi-ingredient approach means you're not putting all your eggs in one basket. If you're looking for comprehensive support rather than targeting just one mechanism, this blend offers more versatility.

# The Cardiovascular Benefits You Can Expect

Based on the ingredient profile and my understanding of these compounds from first-hand research and experimentation, here's what Cardio Slim Tea realistically offers:

**Blood Pressure Support**: The combination of hibiscus, beetroot, hawthorn, and grapeseed extract creates a multi-pronged approach to supporting healthy blood pressure levels. If you are someone with borderline high blood pressure, this could be a helpful adjunct to lifestyle modifications, though it shouldn't replace medication if prescribed.

**Homocysteine Optimization**: The inclusion of TMG specifically targets homocysteine metabolism, which is something most teas completely ignore. Elevated homocysteine is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, so addressing this is genuinely valuable for long-term heart health.

**Antioxidant Protection**: Between the green tea catechins, curcumin, grapeseed extract, and various polyphenols from the herbal ingredients, you're getting robust antioxidant support that helps protect against oxidative stress—a major contributor to cardiovascular aging.

**Gentle Metabolic Support**: The combination of decaffeinated green tea, oolong, ginger, and cinnamon provides mild metabolic enhancement without the jitters or crashes associated with stimulant-heavy weight loss products. I would describe this as supportive rather than dramatically transformative for weight management.

**Inflammation Reduction**: Curcumin, ginger, and green tea all have documented anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic inflammation underlies most cardiovascular disease, so reducing it is fundamental to long-term heart health.

**Where Cardio Slim Tea Falls Short**

To give you a balanced, first-hand assessment, I need to address the limitations:

**Not a Standalone Weight Loss Solution**: Despite the ""Slim"" in its name, this tea won't melt pounds away on its own. The ingredients support metabolism and cardiovascular health, which can facilitate weight management as part of a comprehensive approach, but if you're looking for dramatic weight loss from tea alone, you'll be disappointed. Sustainable slimming comes from balanced diet, regular exercise, and lifestyle modifications—not any tea by itself.

[**Cardio Slim tea** **is more of an overall wellness tea**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/cardioslim.php) with focus on heart health & blood pressure.

**If you’re looking for weight loss, I’d recommend you checkout some other teas out there. Here is a good list-**

[**https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/12-herbal-weight-managment-teas/**](https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/12-herbal-weight-managment-teas/)

 

**Variable Caffeine Content**: While the green tea is decaffeinated, oolong naturally contains caffeine, and ginseng has mild stimulant properties. If you're extremely caffeine-sensitive or planning to drink this in the evening, you might experience some alertness that interferes with sleep. The caffeine content is significantly lower than coffee, but it's not zero across the entire formula.

**Potential Medication Interactions**: Several ingredients—particularly hawthorn, ginseng, curcumin, and grapeseed extract—can interact with blood pressure medications, blood thinners, and other cardiovascular drugs. If you're on any prescription medications, you absolutely must consult your healthcare provider before adding this to your routine. This isn't the product's fault, but it's a reality of working with bioactive compounds.

**No Dosage Transparency**: Like most tea blends, there's no breakdown of exactly how much of each ingredient you're getting per cup. This makes it difficult to compare potency to supplements with standardized doses. If you're someone who prefers precise control over your intake of specific compounds, this lack of transparency might frustrate you.

**Gradual Rather Than Immediate Results**: If you're looking for quick fixes or dramatic overnight changes, you'll be disappointed. The cardiovascular benefits from a tea like this accumulate over weeks and months of consistent use, not days. Patience and consistency are required.

# How to Best Use Cardio Slim Tea

From my experience with various wellness teas, here's how I would approach Cardio Slim Tea for optimal results:

**Timing**: I would recommend drinking 1-2 cups daily. Given the mild caffeine content from oolong and the energizing effects of ginseng, mornings and early afternoons work best. If you're sensitive to caffeine, stick to one cup in the morning and monitor your response before adding an afternoon serving.

**Preparation**: Use water just below boiling (around 190-200°F) and steep for 3-5 minutes. Over-steeping can make it bitter and may extract more caffeine. If you're looking for maximum antioxidant extraction, slightly longer steeping times (up to 7 minutes) can work, but taste the tea and adjust based on preference.

**Consistency**: This is key—sporadic use won't deliver the cardiovascular benefits you're seeking. If you are committed to supporting heart health, make this part of your daily routine for at least 8-12 weeks before evaluating results. The compounds in this tea work cumulatively.

**Hydration Balance**: Even though this has mild diuretic ingredients, make sure you're drinking plenty of water throughout the day. The diuretic effect should be gentle, but if you're not adequately hydrated overall, you might experience headaches or fatigue.

**Dietary Synergy**: To maximize cardiovascular benefits, pair this tea with a heart-healthy diet rich in vegetables, healthy fats, lean proteins, and fiber. The tea supports your efforts but can't overcome a poor diet. If you're looking for comprehensive results, treat this as one tool in your wellness toolkit.

**Medication Timing**: If you take any medications, separate them from the tea by at least 2-3 hours to minimize potential interactions or absorption issues. Always consult your healthcare provider first.

# Final Thoughts: Is Cardio Slim Tea Right for You?

If you are someone who's serious about supporting cardiovascular health through natural means and you're tired of one-dimensional teas that either over-promise or rely on laxative effects, Cardio Slim Tea deserves your consideration.

From my first-hand experience evaluating tea formulations, this represents a more sophisticated approach to wellness teas.

I would particularly recommend this if you're looking for a pleasant-tasting tea that you can incorporate into your daily routine without worrying about dependency, harsh side effects, or the jittery feeling that comes from stimulant-heavy alternatives.

The user testimonials mentioning improved energy, better doctor readings, and the ability to engage more actively with family align with what you'd realistically expect from consistent use of these ingredients.

However, approach this with appropriate expectations. If you're looking for a magic bullet for rapid weight loss, this isn't it—no tea is. But if you're committed to a holistic approach to cardiovascular wellness/heart health and want a genuinely beneficial tea that tastes good and uses quality ingredients, Cardio Slim Tea hits the mark.  ",1,1766627582.0,Health2020,0,1.0,False

1pv2mmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1pv2mmu/christmas_didnt_go_as_expected/,Christmas didn't go as expected.,"Hey there,

Exactly what the title says. I'm celebrating Christmas with my mother. We live alone, and last year Christmas was a joy. This year, not so much.

It started awkward. We enjoyed dinner, but she seemed very stiff and awkward about playing with me on my very first Wii. Not even interested. I let it slide off, watched a movie with her instead, so we can do something we both like instead of forcing her on somethings she doesn't seem even interested in trying.

We usually open our gifts at midnight. Its tradition. I bought her a gift I thought she would enjoy, a new coffee machine. Ours is old, and I remember her complaining about it too. Bought alongside it her favourite coffee brand too.
She didn't like it. She didn't open the box, awkwardly told me she didn't need it. We sat there finishing the movie in silence. I was feeling really upset, didn't know what to do. She didn't seem to know what to say either. Just after a few minutes she told me I could get my money back, and that she wasn't upset with me.

But I'm rather upset. I put thought into the gift, and we don't have much income to play around. I thought she'd enjoy it but her reaction made me somewhat sad. And just all the awkwardness. 
I didn't get a gift. Or well. Apart from a bedsheet I already knew about.


For the first time, I feel sad about Christmas. We're alone, no one has really called, not even my father, I thought my mother would have enjoyed my gift and I couldn't make this night better for us.
I see my friends having lovely Christmas with their families, but I feel empty. For the first time, really. I wish Christmas felt as magical as it felt last year.",1,1766627457.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1pv2m5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/securityguards/comments/1pv2m5l/christmas_eve_at_the_worst_residential_security/,Christmas Eve at the worst residential security site,"Seeing a comment about Christmas bonuses at a condo in the thread about the Christmas soul food meal reminded me I need to tell this war story.  This was Christmas Eve when I was working security full time at a residential site.

A bunch of us had bounced around various sites after our company was underbid by a competitor before landing at a new account our security company had picked up from another competitor.  This was a condo building 20-odd stories tall.  It had several floors of offices below the residential condos and a bunch of businesses on the ground floor.  There was a coffee shop, dry cleaners, convenience store, a couple other small shops and a pretty large pub-style restaurant.

The first clue that this site was going to be a total disaster should have been the fact that *none* of the guards employed by the outgoing security company accepted the over to transition to the company I worked at and stay on site when they took over the account.  Every one of them decided that it was better to leave and take their chances elsewhere except for the supervisor.  The residents at this building and the board members in particular were the nastiest, most caustic, most abusive people I've dealt with in any job.  Almost immediately the turnover spiked between guards requesting to transfer out, guards quitting, guards being kicked out, and within a few months I was one of the senior guys on site.

In December, property management put up signs requesting donations for the staff Christmas bonuses and announced a raffle to raise funds for it.  Security was responsible for handling the sale of the raffle tickets and for opening the property manager's office after hours so people could drop off their donations for the staff bonuses, and were also responsible for opening the condo boardroom so people could look at the raffle prizes which were laid out on the boardroom table.  First prize was this absolutely gigantic gift basket.  Second and third prize were these pretty large armoatherapy kits.

This brings us to December 24.  I arrived for the mid-shift I was working.  The raffle for the prizes had already been drawn and recipients notified.  Bonus cheques for $100 were given to each security guard including one of the new ones that rumour had it the board told the property manager not to give a bonus to.  A couple of us who had been there since the start of the contract had told the property manager that we'd give up some or all of our bonuses to make sure he got one but she was a decent lady and apparently she cut him a bonus cheque and buried the expense.  This was a big warning sign that things were starting to go south badly the day of Christmas Eve.

The property manager shut down the office early and she, the security supervisor, building superintendent, president of the condo board and several board members and a couple of building contractors went to that pub-style restaurant that was on the ground floor of the building.  Someone smashed a bottle of wine in one of the elevators and I ended up cleaning this up.  Someone's dog took a giant dump in another elevator and I ended up cleaning that up.  A couple living in the building complained about the behaviour of some other resident's dogs in the elevator and demanded that I write a report.  I said sure and took down all the details so I could prepare the report and the guy finished by saying he was going to check with the property manager to make sure I did.  Nice, having one's professional integrity called into question like that but report duly written and submitted along with all the others for every incident that had happened so far.

The phone rang.  It was the property manager calling on her cellphone from the pub in a total panic asking me if the winner of the gift basket had seen his prize yet and if he was aware that the tag had been switched.  The way the whole question was phrased confused me and I said that none of the prizes had been collected by their winners yet, but the property manager kept asking if it had been seen.  I told her I didn't know if the prizes had been seen by their winners but that they were still in the boardroom and none of the winners had come to pick up their prizes yet.

Another guard arrived for the start of his shift.  He was on a tight turnaround and had gone home in the morning and come back eight hours later.  He stormed in the door all furious asking if I knew what the president of the condo board had done with the tags on the prizes and he finally gave me the rundown on what happened and suddenly the panicked phone call from the property manager made sense:

The guard was finishing up a midnight shift mid-morning.  The property manager and president of the board of directors had the security supervisor spin the drum and draw out the three winning tickets for the raffle prizes for the staff Christmas bonus fundraiser and the ticket he drew out for the second prize was the president of the condo board.  Instead of declaring a conflict of interest and having second prize drawn again, she kept her winning ticket but she wasn't satisfied with the aromatherapy kit.  Sometime later in the morning before the midnight guard's shift finished up, she had him unlock the boardroom and switched the tags so the legitimate winner of the first prize gift basket got the second prize armoatherapy kit and she got the massive gift basket, then left and went on with the rest of her day.

This is what caused the property manager to call me in a panic asking if the legitimate winner of the gift basket had seen his prize before the tags had been switched.  Apparently the president of the condo board told her about this after the whole group of them had sat down at a table in the pub for their Christmas dinner and now the property manager was having to run damage control in case the person who won first prize in the draw found out the prize had been switched on them.

New signs went up on Christmas day telling the residents that it was not too late to donate money for the staff Christmas bonuses and that security would be able to open the property management office so that any contributions people wanted to make could be dropped off and that they'd ensure it was distributed to staff before the new year.  Every one of us on every shift was opening up the property management office so residents could drop off cheques or cash.  We all knew quite a bit more money had been collected for staff bonuses between December 25th and 31st.  January 1st and the new year came and went, and it became clear several weeks into January that nobody, not security, not cleaners, not the other staff, nobody received any followup bonus from the money that was collected for that purpose.  The rumour was that the condo board divided up that money for themselves.  I don't know if that's true or not, but having seen what happened with the raffle prizes being switched and claimed by the board president, I woulnd't be able to write that rumour off as unbelievable.

I put in for a transfer and got out of there a few more weeks later.  Guard turnover with people quitting, requesting transfers, being removed from site by the condo board, or just up and no-showing and never coming back to that awful condo continued unabated.  During my last week, the supervisor was livid at being forced to work a 16 hour shift because someone walked off the job rather than work another shift there.  I ran into that supervisor several years later and he told me he quit the condo after the property manager left.

Anyhow, that's the story of the worst, most corrupt Christmas I ever had working security.  I hope all of you are staying safe, staying warm and are able to spend some quality time with your family and friends over the holidays.",7,1766627406.0,securityguards,0,1.0,False

\-DAL Cowboys v WAS Commanders Over 50.5 (-110) | 0.5 Units

‍

**Why This Pick?**

This will undoubtedly be the highest scoring game of the day. Both squads suffer defensively, and their last meeting back in October saw a whopping 66 points. Dallas has allowed at least 34 points in their last 3 straight games, and Washington has allowed at least 21 in their last 4. The only thing either team is playing for at this point is pride, and on Christmas Day, I think that will be more than enough incentive for both offenses to play their asses off. My money’s on the Over to cash.

So finally I got the balls to ask her out and she replied very positively+I told her I liked her. So the thing is I've never even went on a date(well some in high but that's doesn't count). I really do not want to screw it up. The scary part is she's 20 years old and she probably has some experience. After also reading some post I have some questions. Where do i take her out? Play some pool at a bar and then grab a drink there? Maybe go to a bar straight away? Maybe take her out to a nice restaurant? Go for just some coffee? I don't know honestly. For the time tho I think early I'm the night is fine? Like at 9 or smth. Also I really want to kiss her but I don't think I can pull it off for a first date. Hug her sure but kiss I don't know(I haven't even done that, I am that inexperienced).

1pv2hbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1pv2hbz/here_is_my_story_d/,Here is my... story :D,"So, I will just start from the moment I moved in to make this less bloated, but ofcourse all of the things that I will mention later I did notice earlier in the relationship and it's my mistake to assume that we can work on her issues.

  
The first day I moved in, she out of nowhere started crying... for 10 hours :D. And I kept trying to sooth her for all of that time. And ofcourse, the crying thing was not one incident, it was daily crying for no reason.

We tried to put it under control and with time, the 10 hours became like...2 hours. Which was a major win and I was so so happy haha. In addition to that, She started to question me about my past, daily. It got to a point where I come back from uni/work and sit beside of her for 6/7 hours to answer her question. It doesnt matter how many times I answer the question, she will ask again.

Things progressed further into that she monitors all of my accounts (FB, IG..etc), and by that point we talked and she aknowledged that she needs professional help, we couldnt afford it so I told her I will stick by your side until that point and then we re-asses.

Ofcourse, things went in a more unctonrolled direction. She reads my conversation with my male/female friends, back to up to two years back, way before me and her met. And takes screenshots and highlights stuff that I need to answer. And ofcourse, if I dont answer or get tired or try to calm her down, she spirals into an anxiety/panic/crying spell that is uncontrollable no matter what. I really felt bad for her, cause I could see she is in pain and its not under her control, so... I did what I thought was good and threw away my boundaries, health, career.. etc to help her and make her life better, until we stabilize financially and become able to afford her a therapist.

Things kept heading in a bad way were I cant watch movies now that have... attractive women :D. She takes my phone without my consent and deletes/blocks all of my female friends, AND I cant even go out and see my MALE friends haha. She gets huge anxiety spikes if I want to go out with my male friends on a weekend in the morning for some coffee. And ofc, I am not allowed to go out at night, alone at all :D.

She kept working on her issue with me, we kept always trying to communicate, understand..etc. And really she was putting a lot of work, so I respected that and continued the relationship.

But then things went worse, no matter what I do or sacrifice or give to just regulate her. I cant have a day without her asking me whether I love her or not, whether I like her body or not..etc. We go to the cinema, and I have to site beside the wall because maybe maybe a woman will sit beside the other chair.... So you know, I just want to have a nice stress free time, and this is just childish to me so I just agree...

  
Things became worse, life became more difficult as I am a foriegner and carrying reality, while she only wants to work prestigous jobs to brag infront of her family. So I was carrying life, her, us..etc. It was super draining so I couldnt regulate her the same way I used to, she assumed that I am going to leave her. She starts to lock me at home, not letting me leave or go outside, not giving me space no matter how much I asked. So I started to lose my nervs and calling her "" crazy fckn b!!ch"". At that point, I really felt that If I maintained my control and my rationale, I will just... drop dead. I did care, love and felt bad for her cause I knew that its not up to her... So I stayed........ made it up with her and ofcourse apologized haha.

  
The loop kept going on, the fights started to increase. and ultimately she started saying that she will kill/throw herself in the river if I left. So, I stayed, but I told her I cant recognize myself, us... I feel like I am a prisoner.. and ofcourse, instead of she trying to soothe me, she projects that into herself and made it about her saying that "" so I am a bad wife "" lmao.. All I wished for is that... I am really sorry, I will keep working and maybe a hug and show some appreciation x\\D.

  
And now, its a suitable time to say that I have been abused by her family amd friends verbally for a long while and ofcourse I have been relaying that to her instead of fighting with her people. Cause you know, maybe she talks with them and puts some boundaries... Which never happened, cause she feels that she will be the bad person to have that talk haha. Anyway, by that point we are facing loads of issues regarding money, housing..etc and I just want to provide for her and secure her... I didnt even think about myself, so I was just killing myself looking for work, working, regulating her, helping her with career..etc. I was barely getting sleep and really really everyday I was feeling like I will just... crash.

  
Anyway, we needed help. She asked her friends.. at the end of the day, we ate all together and I thanked them for the help. They offered to drive us home but I declined cause it was too long of a day for them and they were already sleeping on the dinner table. Her friend didnt take that well ??, looked at me in an insulting way and took her bf and left. Well, I was like ok, I will just ignore that. We started walking towards the nearest bus, her friend kept texting her to come to pick us up and drive us home... I explained what I said above and asked her to relay that and thank her again. Her friend said "" I will shit on that""... and it was relayed to me like it was normal :D. I looked at my wife and saw that she was very tired and cold... so I just agreed for her sake. When her friend came she told me "" get the fuck out of my car"" screaming,, and telling me how do you let her walk in the cold?... I looked at my wife, and just decided not to give her an ultimatum at the moment and handle everything nicely at home.

  
We went home, I told my wife, hey how can you just dont stop her or talk to her about the way she talked with the.. I didnt fight back because of you and decided to handle it between eachother. This wasnt the first time, and THIS IS THE MOMENT I PUT A BOUNDARY. I also told her you will not go to her birthday tomorrow, it was the first time I told her no about something like that. She of course started to cry and deflected... She told me she never told you anything ahahaha. So I was just done with crazystuff, I told her It will be either me or her and I will head to bed. She asked to watch some movies I said No I will head to bed. So she started to cry again and left home... ????. "" Not the first time, she does weird things like that, and she priomised loads of times not to leave at night"". Anyway, I was so tired and not wanting to fight so I just ignored and slept.

  
She goes off the grid for a day, I was mad worried... But at that time I helped her get a job in another country through a mutual connection, he recommended her to the company and I have been researching job market for her field for a while since she was complaining that she cant find a job.. Anyway, so i ignore her ghosting me, I go in the city to look for another job so I can support her travel and stay at the new country... I walked for like 7 hours, checked nearly everywhere in the city and I was lucky to find something, I was mad happy cause now I can secure her, she will have money later for therapy, I will be able to recover and relax a bit and we can continue our life.

  
Now, she comes with her same friend and her bf. They assault me physicaly and verbally at my home :D. She takes her stuff and leaves with them,. After that, she sends me divorce letter , that was written by her friend and sent to me, so she didnt even bother to write it herself. Then she comes home and wants to stay back with me and us becoming together again ahahaha. I confronted her about what she did, I was mad angry, I couldnt believe it. She never aknowledged that incident, always deflecting and telling me that my story about what happened is wrong, They never hit me xDDDDD. 

This is getting too long at this point , there is ofc more details to put her. But one thing to mention before I stop writing is that I got several jobs in muktinational compnanies,,, that I declined because she wont be able to find a job for herself there. 

She is now smearing my reputation in addition to everything while I am stuck with delivering food :D. 

I refused to sign the divorce papers, cause she says to people that I am the one who wants divorce and told her she has to completly own it and go another way that will take like 6 months but it wont require my signature. Which she hadnt do so far :D.

I still get PTSD symptoms at night, running towards the door thinking that people are going to assault me again during my sleep. For nearly a month I thought I was about to get daily heart attacks... But now I am better, thankfully I have a two friends that were very patient with me during my time with my ex/wife.

  
I grew from our time together as a person, I know I am capable of great love, responsibility, understanding..etc. I learnt alot about life, relationships, people... and most importantly my relationship with my mom and dad was rocky and after that stuff that happened to me, it brought me closer to them, I now understand how much difficult and hard marriage, life, raising kids, career is.. and I deeply deeply appreciate them and in disblief about how they managed to achieve everything they achieved. I am lucky to have them, and I am lucky I survived my marriage.

After a force recompile, the CG now works and displays properly. 

[The force recompile made the body visible, but now the character's custom namebox \(sun in top left corner\) has disappeared.](https://preview.redd.it/snkidjmnx89g1.png?width=1803&format=png&auto=webp&s=90ba62839b704ab3034250b4fdd8f55a3186de33)

However, the character's unique namebox no longer appears. None of the character-specific nameboxes do -- despite the fact that I had not touched that part of the code before or after the recompile.   


The code for nameboxes is as follows:

    ## Make the namebox available for styling through the Character object.
    init python:
      config.character_id_prefixes.append('namebox')
    
    # Style for the box containing the speaker's name
    style namebox:
        xpos -50
        ypos -90
        xysize (1200, 277)
        background Image(""gui/text/namebox.png"", xalign=0.487, yalign=0.35)
        padding (5, 5, 5, 5)
    
    # Style for the text with the speaker's name
    style say_label:

        yalign 0
        size 70
        font ""DarlingCoffee.ttf""
        outlines [ (absolute(3), ""#ffffff"", absolute(0), absolute(0)) ]

The code for the character is as follows:

    define f = Character (_(""Kin""), color=""#fcc781"", image = ""kin"", namebox_background=Image(""gui/text/namebox_ki.png"", xalign=0.487, yalign=0.35))

* I follow this pattern for every other character with a unique namebox.
* Changing ""Image"" to ""Frame"" does nothing but change the namebox's placement on screen.
* When a nameless character speaks, the namebox disappears as it should.
* I have not touched the image files nor their locations.
* This code worked perfectly fine before the recompile.

If anyone could provide some sort of insight as to why this happened or how to fix it, I'd be forever appreciative. I would be happy to provide more of my code if needed to assess/fix the problem.",1,1766626738.0,RenPy,1,1.0,False

1pv2bps,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1pv2bps/your_environment_isnt_just_influencing_you_its/,"Your environment isn't just influencing you, it's literally determining your habits. Here's how to design your way to better behavior.","We need to talk about why ""just have more willpower"" is terrible advice. I recently discovered research on environment design, and it completely changed how I think about habit formation. It explained exactly why I can't resist eating chips when they're visible on the counter, but have no cravings when they're hidden in a cabinet.

If you feel like you're constantly fighting against your own actions despite your best intentions, read this.

1. The Visibility Effect (Why willpower always fails)

The research I found explained that environment design isn't just helpful for habit change; it's the primary driver.

Every object in your visual field creates a psychological ""pull"" on your attention and behavior. The more visible something is, the more likely you are to engage with it. The problem is that most of us default-design our spaces for convenience rather than for our goals.

When your environment is working against your intentions:

Your willpower depletes rapidly throughout the day.

Your best-laid plans crumble in the face of visible temptations.

Your goals feel impossibly difficult despite your genuine desire to achieve them.

You aren't just ""undisciplined."" You have created an environment that makes bad habits easy and good habits difficult.

2. The Path of Least Resistance

Beyond the visual cues, there is the friction factor. The harsh reality is: ""Humans will nearly always choose the option with the least resistance, regardless of their stated values.""

We say we want to read more, but leave books on shelves while keeping our phones in our pockets. We claim we want to eat healthier, but store vegetables in crisper drawers while keeping snacks at eye level.

This constant battle against your own environment drains the mental energy you need to actually work toward meaningful change.

3. How to ""Design, Don't Decide"" (The Fix)

The only sustainable way forward is to redesign your environment. The goal is to shift from a Willpower Mindset to a Design Mindset. Here is the protocol I'm using to reshape my behavior without relying on motivation:

Phase 1: Friction Audit  
You need to identify where your environment is working against you.

The Rule: Analyze how many steps it takes to perform both good and bad habits in your current setup.

The Goal: Recognize that your ""choices"" are largely determined by the paths of least resistance in your environment.

Phase 2: The ""20-Second Rule""  
Make bad habits take 20 seconds longer and good habits 20 seconds faster.

Put the TV remote in a drawer rather than on the coffee table.

Set out workout clothes the night before.

Pre-cut vegetables and place them at eye level in the fridge.

The Shift: Even tiny amounts of added friction dramatically change behavior patterns.

Phase 3: Prime Your Spaces  
Your environment should trigger the right behaviors automatically.

Create activity zones (reading chair with no devices allowed, dedicated workout corner).

Use visual cues (water bottle on desk, fruit bowl on counter).

Remove competing stimuli (no TV in bedroom, no phone during meals).

Treat your environment like a behavior programming system. You wouldn't expect software to run without the right code; don't expect your habits to change without the right cues.",1,1766626379.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False

One of the biggest clues is his deliberate placement in the background of Vecna's first memory of Max, when she gets the nosebleed. Mike doesn't need to be there narratively, so his presence feels like an intentional hint that he too will experience Vecna's curse. We also know that Vecna's curse leads the victims to suffer from nightmares, and we repeatedly see Mike drinking coffee at the breakfast table and in the hospital, suggesting that he may need caffeine due to difficulty sleeping. On top of that, Vecna targets people with deep trauma, and Mike has endured more than enough of it. Finally, Nancy's S4 vision showed her mother, Holly, AND MIKE dead. Her mum and Holly have already been endangered, so Mike is the only one from that vision who hasn't yet faced a direct attack. All of this strongly suggests that he will be Vecna'd.

With Vecna's curse, we know that the victims are tormented by their deepest traumas and darkest secrets. For Mike, he clearly suffers from internalised homophobia and shame around his queerness, so it makes sense that Vecna would use this as ammunition for breaking him down. It would be the perfect narrative device for exploring Mike's queerness and recontextualising his relationship with Will. I think we'll get a montage that revisits earlier scenes from Mike's perspective, revealing that he's always loved Will - that the shared looks, knee-bumping, etc. were intentional, just as Robin lists as signs of romantic interest. The Chekhov's gun of the painting will be fired here: Vecna could taunt Mike for sitting there knowing Will made it for him and saying nothing because he was scared of acknowledging their feelings. 

Vecna will also attack Mike's core insecurities about masculinity and bravery. He'll mock Mike's self-image as a strong, courageous leader, calling him weak for hiding his feelings and refusing to be honest about who he is. I can hear Vecna sneering 'You call yourself Mike the Brave. Michael, do you really believe you are brave?' before going IN on Mike being a coward for repressing his true self.

I then believe that Mike will be saved from Vecna by 'Smalltown Boy' by Bronski Beat being played for him - it was on his official S1 Spotify playlist and I think it reflects his character PERFECTLY. It's a song about a closeted gay person realising they need to leave their small town to live authentically as their queer self. This would give us a cinematic moment where everything clicks for Mike - that his fear has been holding him back and that confessing to Will is the only way forward - while Smalltown Boy plays.

To cap it all off, I think something bad will happen to Will, most likely him being taken into the Upside Down again. That will be the breaking point for Mike. He’ll completely crash out and decide, 'fuck it, I can't lose him again, he needs to know how I feel"". When Will returns, Mike will confess, which will of course be reciprocated by Will. Just like Will's love for Mike allowed him to unlock his powers to save everybody from the Demogorgons, Mike and Will's combined love - along with the sisterly love of Kali and El - will be pivotal in defeating Vecna, who is an entity representing hate. This would be a beautiful ending that perfectly aligns with the core themes of found family, embracing your differences as a superpower, uplifting the outcasts and the 'freaks' of society, etc. And I believe it's very achievable in the time we have left in the season! 💙💛",73,1766626281.0,byler,17,0.96,False

“Trustless. Permissionless. Surprisingly windowless.”

The Blockchain Innovation Center is a cutting-edge civic facility dedicated to decentralizing responsibility while centralizing buzzwords. Inside its meticulously replicated offices, every transaction, meeting, and coffee purchase is permanently recorded in a ledger that no one fully understands—but everyone agrees is revolutionary.

Citizens are invited to marvel at the building’s vast computational wing, where enormous amounts of electricity are converted into confidence. The Center proudly produces no physical goods, but generates an endless stream of whitepapers, pilot programs, and proofs of concept explaining why results are coming very soon.

Despite having no clear purpose, the Blockchain Innovation Center is impossible to shut down once built. Any attempt to remove it must be validated by a majority consensus of adjacent buildings, several cryptographic keys, and one intern who has misplaced the password.

Elliot Reed sat cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by paper.

Not scattered—**arranged**.

Missing persons reports covered the carpet like fallen leaves. Jack. Mike. John. Leo Hawkins. Marcus Hawkins. Sarah. Evan. Each with dates, locations, and one shared note written in the margins:

**MENTIONED A CARTOON.**

Elliot circled two names harder than the rest.

LEO HAWKINS  
MARCUS HAWKINS

Brothers.

Same last name.

Different outcomes.

Leo institutionalized after committing multiple violent crimes, repeating the same phrase during every arrest:

>

Marcus—never found.

Elliot leaned back against the couch, rubbing his eyes.

“Two brothers don’t break the same way unless something broke them first,” he muttered.

He opened a new tab.

ASHER HAWKINS.

# THE HOUSE

Asher Hawkins lived in a quiet neighborhood.

Too quiet.

The kind of street where wind moved trees but nothing else moved at all. No kids. No dogs. No decorations. Just houses pretending to be normal.

Asher’s home sat at the end of the block.

Lights on.

Curtains open.

Like he was waiting.

Elliot parked and sat for a moment, watching the house.

Then he grabbed his notebook and stepped out into the cold.

# ASHER HAWKINS

Asher answered the door before Elliot could knock.

He smiled.

Not wide.

Not forced.

Just… ready.

“You’re here about my boys,” Asher said.

Elliot froze.

“…Yes,” he replied carefully. “How did you—”

Asher stepped aside.

“Come in.”

The house smelled like old paper and coffee.

Family photos lined the hallway.

Leo and Marcus as kids—laughing by a fireplace. Missing teeth. Cartoon drawings taped to the wall behind them.

Elliot slowed his steps.

“What did you do for work, Mr. Hawkins?” he asked.

Asher’s smile twitched.

“I made things people watched.”

# THE DRAWINGS

Asher led Elliot into a study.

The desk was clean—but the shelves were not.

Sketchbooks filled every inch.

Asher picked one up and flipped it open.

Black-and-white drawings.

A smiling cartoon figure.

White eyes.

A top hat.

A cane.

Elliot’s throat tightened.

“You drew this?” he asked.

Asher nodded proudly.

“He used to make people happy.”

*Used to*, Elliot noticed.

“When?” Elliot asked.

Asher looked at the drawings longer than necessary.

“Before people forgot.”

# LEO AND MARCUS

“They loved him,” Asher continued. “They watched me draw him every night. Leo asked questions. Marcus watched quietly.”

Elliot scribbled notes.

“And when did things change?”

Asher closed the sketchbook.

“When views went down.”

The room felt colder.

“People stopped watching,” Asher said calmly. “Stopped caring. You know what happens to things no one watches, right?”

Elliot didn’t answer.

Asher smiled again.

“My boys noticed before I did.”

# THE BASEMENT DOOR

As Elliot stood to leave, he noticed something.

A door.

At the end of the hallway.

Painted over multiple times.

Scratches around the frame.

“Basement?” Elliot asked.

Asher’s voice stayed calm.

“Yes.”

A pause.

“Just storage.”

From somewhere beneath the house—

A soft *thump*.

Once.

Elliot didn’t flinch.

“Did Leo ever talk about the basement?” he asked.

Asher met his eyes.

“No.”

The thump came again.

Louder.

Asher spoke over it.

“They forgot my cartoon,” he said softly. “But my boys didn’t.”

# LEAVING

As Elliot stepped outside, his phone buzzed.

A new voicemail.

# VOICEMAIL (PLAYED LATER)

Static.

Then breathing.

Then a faint, cheerful voice buried under distortion:

I had another nightmare last night. I was small and my dad was putting it in my face. I begged him to stop. The walls were closing in. 

I woke up. Fed the kids. Had coffee and a cigarette. I asked one of my housemates to buy me a pack. I have started smoking again. I hate that I am. They don’t even taste good anymore.

I went back to bed. I dreamed that I was getting married. My friend B from Texas came back to walk me down the aisle. I got pregnant. I got pregnant and I wasn’t afraid. Just really hungry with weird cravings.

My aunts and cousins showed up and started getting mad at me and laughing at me. 

There are so many nightmares. I miss my dreams being at the forefront of my imagination and subconscious.

I am scared. 

I know you don’t see this and that this isn’t actually me talking to you. 

I can’t talk to anyone today because it is a holiday. A holiday that so many people love. But, I don’t. I hate today. 

I love you and I miss you. Sometimes, this timeline feels warped. You don’t get along with my friends and I don’t get along with yours. Maybe that is too much of a blanket statement. But, we operate in such different social ecosystems.

I don’t understand the synchronicities or how we were necessary opposites that brought simultaneous peace and growth. Despite the chaos and challenges, those truths still existed.

When I do dream, I dream of you sometimes. It is nice.

I hope my dreams come back soon. I am tired of the nightmares. The ones where I am small.
