Especially if I don‚Äôt seem too occupied, like if i‚Äôm not on my phone or if i‚Äôm not listening to music, or even holding a cup of coffee in my hands.

I overthink and start thinking that I am inconveniencing others by existing in a space where they may need to do something productive. I don‚Äôt want to be like this anymore.

Maybe you guys can help me by simply telling me what your first thoughts are when you see someone not doing anything or simply just loitering in a public space ?",1,1731730133.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

Greetings, coffee lovers!

I come to you with a bit of a dilemma. I‚Äôm looking to buy a coffee machine but can‚Äôt decide which one would suit us best.

Here‚Äôs a little backstory: we moved from Ukraine to North America about a year and a half ago, and ever since, we‚Äôve been struggling to find good coffee. I don‚Äôt want to generalize about where coffee is better or worse‚Äîeveryone has their own preferences. But we‚Äôre used to a richer flavor than what we‚Äôve found here so far.

My favorite drink is cappuccino‚Äîthick, creamy, with good foam, and a balanced taste of milk and coffee. Low bitterness, but strength and just a light acidity. We first tried a Keurig, and no offense to anyone, but that‚Äôs flavored water, not coffee. We tried about a dozen different capsules for it‚Äîranging from ‚Äúit‚Äôs drinkable‚Äù to outright awful.

Now I‚Äôm torn between the Nespresso Original Line (OL) and Vertuo. I understand the conceptual differences, but I‚Äôm not sure how it works out in practice. An important note: we only drink coffee without sugar. Besides cappuccinos, we occasionally drink espresso/lungo, and my wife also likes Americanos.

So, which would be better for us‚ÄîOriginal Line or Vertuo? I‚Äôm leaning toward the OL, but Vertuo does have larger portion sizes, which can be convenient.

And about the capsules: is it worth considering third-party ones, or should we stick with Nespresso‚Äôs own?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any insights or advice! ",1,1731729825.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been on medication for around 5 or so months now (Adderall, 15mg if that matters), and I recently discovered that the acidity in coffee can reduce effectiveness/absorption of the medication.

During the work week I drink quite a bit of coffee (I generally get less sleep during the weeks). While I thought that I experienced little to no symptoms from combining coffee with adderall, a recent break from the medication made me realize that it might be exasperating some social anxiety.

But‚Ä¶ I love my coffee! I drink it black. I thought about switching to half caff/decaf, but because of the acidity potentially lowering the effectiveness, I figured I might as well look into alternatives. I don‚Äôt really like anything sweet and I can‚Äôt stomach tea in the morning for some reason.. Has anyone tried any alternatives, like Mushroom Coffee for caffeine free energy? Or have any other recommendations?

I **lost an important keyring** ***(containing both my car keys, a house key, a mailbox key, a small fob ‚Äî along with a precious little charm my recently deceased uncle gave me)*** in the tumble between that *US Gas* & the *South Coast Mitsubishi*, on the Eastern intersection. I will offer a cash reward of $50 for the safe & prompt return of my keys! 

Feeling altogether intact (but more than a healthy bit embarrassed), I hopped up quickly without looking behind or checking my pockets. So while I managed to keep my iced coffee upright in the fall, I failed to prioritize properly in the moment and certainly lost the keys there.

I live only a block up and had the keys just prior. But when I crashed, I landed on my hip & sadly they were in a loose grey hoodie pocket on the side that gravity didn‚Äôt favor. 

**This occurred at 5:30pm on 15 Nov. 2024** toward the Southeastern edge of Harbor.

I figure since it happened less than a mile from the police station, perhaps a **Good Samaritan** may have witnessed or will have since located them. I hope that person then then decides to turn them in to the police station or sees this post. I skated back and forth looking for them to no avail within 15 minutes of the fall, and even asked the gas station guys if anyone turned anything in. I had no luck. So I skated 0.75 mi down Fair Dr. to CMPD and filed a lost property report. 

If you if you saw this or know of anyone who recovered my keys, please reach out to me or take them to the police station down the road. I‚Äôd be happy to pay you a reward for the good deed. I‚Äôm sure they will turn up. I‚Äôll also post other places. Maybe I should print signs to post at that intersection? I am open to ideas.

- **One-Touch Brewing:** Simply insert a capsule, press a button, and the machine does the rest. It's that easy!
- **Fast Heat-Up Time:** It heats up in under 15 seconds, so you won‚Äôt wait long for your coffee fix.
- **Automatic Capsule Ejection:** After brewing, the machine automatically ejects the used capsule into the container for easy disposal.

### Customizable Coffee Experience

This coffee maker also offers customization options to suit individual preferences. The Creatista model comes with a built-in milk frother that allows you to create professional-grade lattes and cappuccinos right at home.

### Quality and Durability

The Nespresso Vertuo Creatista is built to last. Crafted by Breville, a renowned name in kitchen appliances, this coffee maker is made from high-quality materials. You can expect reliable performance and durability, making it a worthwhile investment for any coffee enthusiast.

Check Details Here: https://homeandgardendreams.com/nespresso-vertuo-creatista-coffee-and-espresso-maker-by-breville  
  
### Environmental Consideration

Nespresso is committed to sustainability. The coffee capsules are recyclable, and the company has programs in place for recycling used capsules. By choosing this coffee maker, you can enjoy your coffee while also contributing to a more sustainable future.

#### Ease of Maintenance

Keeping the Nespresso Vertuo Creatista clean is a breeze. The removable parts, including the drip tray and the milk frother, are easy to wash and maintain. Plus, the machine has a descaling reminder that alerts you when it needs to be cleaned, ensuring your machine stays in top condition.

Check Details Here: https://homeandgardendreams.com/nespresso-vertuo-creatista-coffee-and-espresso-maker-by-breville  
  
### Cost and Value

While the price may be higher than typical coffee machines, the features and benefits far justify the investment. The quality of coffee you can achieve at home rivals that of professional caf√©s, saving you money in the long run. With the added convenience of having both coffee and espresso options at your fingertips, it offers excellent value.

Ultimately, the Nespresso Vertuo Creatista Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville encapsulates the essence of convenience, quality, and style.

Comparing Nespresso Vertuo Creatista with Other Popular Coffee Machines on the Market
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're shopping for a new coffee machine, the Nespresso Vertuo Creatista by Breville is likely on your radar. This advanced coffee and espresso maker brings a touch of luxury to your kitchen, but how does it stack up against other popular options? Let‚Äôs dive into a comparison with traditional coffee makers, espresso machines, and other single-serve options to help you decide.

Check Details Here: https://homeandgardendreams.com/nespresso-vertuo-creatista-coffee-and-espresso-maker-by-breville  
  
### Design and Aesthetics

The Nespresso Vertuo Creatista features a sleek, modern design that fits well in any kitchen. Its stainless steel body gives it a premium feel, making it more attractive than many plastic models on the market. In comparison, traditional drip coffee makers are often bulkier with less emphasis on aesthetics, while some espresso machines can look industrial. If style is essential to you, the Vertuo Creatista stands out as a centerpiece.

### Brewing Technology

This model employs unique Centrifusion technology. This rotates the coffee pod as it brews, ensuring a rich and creamy extraction for your beverages. In contrast, standard drip coffee makers pour water over grounds, which can lead to uneven brews. Traditional espresso machines push hot water with pressure, which can take longer to set up but offers a different flavor profile. The technology that Nespresso uses makes brewing quick and consistent, which is perfect for busy mornings.

Check Details Here: https://homeandgardendreams.com/nespresso-vertuo-creatista-coffee-and-espresso-maker-by-breville  
  
### Beverage Variety

With the Nespresso Vertuo Creatista, you can make a range of drinks, from a small espresso to a large mug of coffee. You can also froth milk with its built-in steam wand, allowing you to create lattes and cappuccinos easily. Here‚Äôs how it compares:

- **Nespresso Vertuo Creatista:** Offers both coffee and espresso with milk frothing capabilities.
- **Traditional Coffee Makers:** Generally limited to drip coffee, with no espresso or milk options.
- **Espresso Machines:** Focus primarily on espresso shots but may vary in milk options depending on the model.
- **Single-Serve Machines (like Keurig):** Typically only brew coffee and lack the frothing capabilities.

### Ease of Use

The Nespresso Vertuo Creatista shines in its user-friendly design. Simply insert a pod, choose your size, and press a button. The machine takes care of the rest. On the other hand, if you opt for a manual espresso machine, you‚Äôll need to learn how to grind, tamp, and brew your coffee, which can be a learning curve. Traditional coffee makers streamline the process but may lack the convenience of a one-button operation.

Check Details Here: https://homeandgardendreams.com/nespresso-vertuo-creatista-coffee-and-espresso-maker-by-breville  
  
### Maintenance and Cleaning

Cleaning the Nespresso Vertuo Creatista is straightforward with its automatic cleaning function. After each use, it prompts you on how to maintain your machine. In this area, traditional coffee machines can require more effort, especially if you have to clean the carafe and filter manually. Espresso machines also need more regular maintenance to keep the espresso quality high. If you want ease of maintenance, the Vertuo Creatista is a strong contender.

### Cost Considerations

While investing in a high-quality coffee maker like the Nespresso Vertuo Creatista may feel daunting, consider the overall value. It retails at a higher price than standard drip machines but competes well with high-end espresso makers. When comparing costs:

Check Details Here: https://homeandgardendreams.com/nespresso-vertuo-creatista-coffee-and-espresso-maker-by-breville  
  
- **Nespresso Vertuo Creatista:** Premium pricing, but offers a versatile range of drinks.
- **Traditional Coffee Makers:** Affordable options available, often lacking versatility.
- **Espresso Machines:** Can range from budget to high-end, focusing mainly on espresso.
- **Single-Serve Machines:** Usually budget-friendly, but limited to coffee options.

Ultimately, your choice will depend on your taste preferences, budget, and lifestyle. If you're looking for a stylish, versatile machine that can brew both coffee and espresso effortlessly, the Nespresso Vertuo Creatista by Breville is an excellent option. It combines technology, ease of use, and aesthetic appeal into one package, making your coffee experience more enjoyable.

Whichever machine you choose, consider how each feature aligns with your daily coffee routine. Weigh the pros and cons of each option to find the one that fits your needs best. Happy brewing!

### Conclusion

When it comes to elevating your coffee and espresso experience, the Nespresso Vertuo Creatista Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville stands out as a worthy investment. Its innovative features, such as the customizable coffee sizes and the automatic milk frother, make crafting the perfect cup of coffee at home effortless. You can enjoy a flavorful espresso or a creamy latte, tailoring each drink to your personal taste preferences.

1gseghb,https://www.reddit.com/r/shoppingaddiction/comments/1gseghb/how_is_everyone_doing_this_weekend_an_update_from/,How is everyone doing this weekend? An update from me.,"In the last two weeks or so, I've discovered something about myself that I thought would never return to. A state of equilibrium that seemed unattainable:

The allure is gone.

In the throes of my addiction, I, like most shopping addicts, not only indulged in the act of purchasing, but also in the days of research, planning and then the eventual hunting phase. During this time, I joined several tkmaxx groups, home decor groups, and kids toys groups in an effort to maximise the chance for a successful hunt.

But when things finally came to a head, and I was forced to address the shopping habits one cold morning in February, I felt it would be good practice to leave the shopping and fan groups. One by one, I deleted myself from them. I left all, but the tkmaxx groups. For some reason that was the hardest and I couldn't follow through. There was such a pull there that I couldn't describe. Was it the novelty? The fomo? Who knows. All I knew is that I couldn't leave. I stopped purchasing but *couldn't leave.*

Realising this, I gave myself permission to stay in the interim, even convincing myself that it might be a good place to sell some unwanted goods. I could watch but not touch the goodies, and so long as I was only doing that, I'd be safe. Or so I thought.

The pull was strong. Easter goodies came and went, as did mother's day, then halloween, and now we're at Christmas. And it all kept pulling me in. *Look but not touch, look but not touch, look.. but.. not.. touch..* I'd remind myself. The urges were so bad, I longed for a straight jacket to contain them.

Then one random day, while drinking my coffee and having my daily look, something strange happened...

The allure was gone. It was subtle at first.

I was flipping through photos of shop stock, and felt nothing. Flipping through them almost felt like drudgery. I didn't even have to reiterate the motto. Strange, but ""Oh its just because there's nothing cute on those shelves"" I'd say.

Then on another day, came a photo of a haul, and still nothing. There was no excitement, and no surge of dopamine that's for sure.

Hmmm, curiouser and curiouser. Surely they were flukes.

""I just haven't found anything I like yet"" I proclaimed.

As the days rolled by, more shop photos appeared in my feed, followed by more mini hauls, and accompanied by stylised photos using contents from said mini hauls, but *I still. felt. nothing*. There was this emptiness. Everything I was looking at started to appear homogeneous, and was broken down to its core components. It didn't matter that it was a new design, it looked like the old design. It didn't matter that it was **that** coveted item all over instagram, it was just a shaped piece of ceramic or threads woven in a certain way, it didnt matter that it was.. *oh my God...* the allure is gone. Nothing had it's colour and shininess anymore. Everything just looked like an iteration of the last batch no matter the changes, and then came the realisation that if I missed out today, this week, this month or this year, I need not worry, as there will be yet another iteration next year. There is nothing to be afraid of by leaving. There is nothing to log on for. There is nothing to miss. 

For the first time since fighting the addiction, I felt this strange indelible warmth wash over me. The shackles had broken, and I was going to be okay.

I didn't leave the group. I still have some items to sell there. But whenever the group pops up on my feed during my coffee break, it's no longer a race to click and see what's out there, it's now more of a surreal ""looking from the outside in"" type of observance.

As I watched more group members upload 30, 40 and 50 photos that they spent 2 hours gathering, I couldn't help but pity them. I wondered what else they could have been doing with that time, and I was so thankful I was no longer there, waiting, watching and acting on this compulsion... this endless insatiable yearn, for something that never could be truly fulfilled.

\-- It seems like the nespresso Vertuo Plus is the favorite? 

\-- Can you use reusable pods with your own coffee? I really don't like k-cups cause of the waste factor and I prefer to use my own coffee and not buy pods constantly. My quick search shows some reusable ones with silicone caps but not sure how well that works. There's others with foil caps -- I guess I could consider but I do find that a little wasteful for my preference.

SFW! Long post ahead.

We all just want to find the person who we can be free and secure to be ourselves with.  Probability of that happening here ‚Äî slim. But I‚Äôm still willing to see if it happens and something longterm can come out of it. Perhaps a wholesome coffee chat would be a good start :). Just to see if we like each other enough 

What I look for ( don‚Äôt worry i wont ask for standards I cant keep):

    29+ ( I really get a long with older and more experienced people)
    Single
    Trying to live their best life
    Easy on the eyes din 
    Decent
    Respectful of boundaries
    Mature and self-sufficient 
    Knows how to communicate
    NOT arrogant 
    Vaxxed (believes that covid exists)
    Not DDS or Marcos apologist
    Not a flake
    Naka move on na sa previous relationship 
    Preferably, someone in Taguig area, but we can arrange things.


About me:

I‚Äôm 29 year old working professional based in Taguig. Well read and can articulate myself well. I enjoy leisurely walks and sitting in cafes. I‚Äôm fairly active I do some sports and outdoor activities. I‚Äôm pretty open to learning and gaining experience about anything, except advanced mathematics üòÖ. I used to be an avid reader, but I‚Äôve shifted to podcasts recently. I‚Äôve done some traveling here and there and would love to be able to do it again in the future. 

Values that are important to me ‚Äî honestly aren‚Äôt these the bare minimum?:

Healthy communication.  This is something I myself am continuously working on. A lot of people can communicate, but not necessarily in a heathy way. May it be in a casual conversation, expressing needs, conveying emotions and navigating conflict. It comes down to identifying and respecting each other‚Äôs emotions and boundaries. It‚Äôs a two way street after all.

Drive for improvement. Whether professionally or in terms of character. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a grand goal as long as there is growth.

Respect. This could show in the form of being responsive to to people‚Äôs needs/concerns, including your own. Or in another form, recognizing that someone is their own person despite differences.

Honesty. Being honest with yourself,  being genuine with your intentions, to being fair with your work... Lying makes it easy to achieve short term goals, but never what truly matters, like upholding one‚Äôs integrity. Besides dishonesty will only foster resentment  when one is not open and clear.

What‚Äôs next? If you identify with the post send me a dm. Share some stuff about you please dami ko na sinabi ikaw naman :).

","We have been happily married for 28 years. We laugh together, we cry together, and we are very supportive of each other. We have a house, a large yard, and we primarily work from home. 

In the last 28 years, we have had 3 cats and 2 dogs which we both cherished because we cannot have children. We lost our last pet, a dog, almost a year ago. 

The other day, I was doing some deliveries early AM when I came across 2 puppies about 8 weeks old. I looked around for an owner and could not find one so I scooped them up and put them in my car. I did the responsible thing and phoned the Humane Society. They asked me to keep the puppies in my car until they opened, which I did, but mistakenly named one and assumed my wife would be happy to have a little, 4-legged son in the house. I was wrong. I dropped both off at the humane society and went home, all excited, to tell my wife and to let her know we could adopt one. 

To make a long story shorter, she said now which resulted in a huge argument between us. She has low self-esteem, (refuses all counseling) and now says I think she is a bad person and I am going to leave over this which is far from the truth.

The truth is, I have PTSD, and was recently diagnosed with 2 and possibly 3 terminal diseases. I have always had a dog in my life. It is who I am. She knows this and has always been happy with it. 

A major change took place this year when I was admitted to the hospital and had over 12 ER visits before my team of doctors was able to bring things under control. This has stressed my wife to the end of her rope.  I am getting better every day. The doctors outlook is now good. 

Now that I am on the mend, and finding these puppies, I made the mistake of naming one and assuming my wife would welcome him into the house. This disagreement has created a divide in our marriage that never existed before. She has told me what I think (anger towards her, thinking she is a Bitch, and even asked me if I would leave her. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!

I, on the other hand was stupid enough to get my hopes so high that now with this rejection, I am crushed. My heart is broken. I am a dog person who needs the companionship to make it through each day and each flashback. I can care for a dog and they give me unconditional love. I talk to them and cherish each moment together as I do with my wife. 

I wont give up on our marriage but I don't know what to do or how to solve things. I am lonely without a dog, I go for walks, play, coffee run and simply drive in the country so my dog can enjoy the scenery. There is a part of me missing, and now a fist has irritated that missing section. 

We barely talk now. Laughter has gone, We are at odds with each other with no compromise in sight. 

I take care of all our pets. All my wife has to do is give a little pat to them once in a while. I leave  nothing for her to worry about with animal care. 

This has created such a huge gap between us, I need someway to close it and heal both our broken hearts.

This package is another loss for me because I did not enjoy any of the scents enough to purchase but I honestly enjoyed sniffing these more than that one bad sample haul. 

Let us begin with Room 1015. I've been dying to try their scents, but for whatever reason, I did not get Cherry Punch but instead got Purple Mantra and Sweet Leaf. I personally believe that these two smell exactly how the basement smells in That's 70 show. Both had very strong incense scents, except one was more floral and the other more eucalyptus. Sweet Leaf had a marijuana note, and it did smell a little like weed. I quite enjoy Purple Mantra and will be keeping it. 

Next, we have two from Imaginary Authors, and these two convinced me that I will not be trying any others at the moment. Language of Glaciers smelled like pines but not in a way I enjoyed. It smelled cold at first, which I loved, but it settled to something more masculine. Meanwhile, Fox in the flowerbed(I adore the name), at first sniff, smelled exactly like I was walking through a haunted house in Halloween Horror Nights. It settled to a lovely floral but also acetone. 

I finally got to try Arquiste and wanted to love this brand, but I think I picked the wrong scents. Peau was a beautiful scent and I LOVE the story behind it (I love that this perfume brand is inspired by moments in history and buildings) but it leaned too masculine for me, Flor y Canto should have been right up my alley and it was lovely, based on Mexican flowers but I find that I don't love tuberose and last we have Almond Suede which is gourmand that is supposed to smell like almond marzipan and leather and this one I need more time with, it smelled like bitter almonds but I could not stop sniffing. 

I tried a couple from Asian Perfume houses, including d'Annam's Monsoon Tea and I wanted to love it and I could have except Lime. I hate the smell of lime, hate the taste, reminds me of old Latin recipes my abuela used to make me drink when I was sick. This one was beautiful (just not for me) but also smelled like margaritas at first sniff. I tried Seoul from One Day and this one smelled like coffee spilled on dirt road, I've smelled Taipei and Jasmine tea from this brand and both are so realistic to what they smell like and I can say the same for Seoul. The next one makes me so sad, because I loved it on paper but on skin it was a no. J-scent's Hanamizake is described to be like drinking sake under a cherry blossom tree and I could smell the sake and florals and it was beautiful but on my skin, it smelled like dish water. I do wanna try this house again and hopefully I fine one I enjoy. 

Mattiere Parisian Musc was a lovely fig, but I realized that I am not a strong perfume girly and really enjoy my light ethereal kind of perfumes. Herbcraft Hypnotica smelled like incense burning in a witches cabin, another scent I was not upset by but would not purchase fully. 

So here it is, all the samples I smelled. these are all first impressions and I do plan on gifting most of these but I can't wait to smell the next round of samples which are a couple from Zoologist perfumery. ",4,1731726747.0,FemFragLab30plus,1,1.0,False

Initially, I was going to read it myself and give you a ""woman's take"" on the story, but honestly it would be too painful now. I'm not even sure if I want to read the other books you recommended me. They're just sitting on the floor next to my desk and I'm debating whether or not to return them. I might just wait until enough time has pass.

I remember when you first told me about your favorite story, I immediately searched online for a hard copy of it. You said you were borrowing your friend's copy, so I wanted to surprise you with it if we ever met half way in Japan. I would still like to meet you in person some day, but creating memories in the flesh would only make it harder to move on. It's painful just writing this letter.

After I decided to take a break from messaging and calling you, I shared the story of how I met you online because I had no one to talk to about it. The reactions were really mixed. Many men and women thought it was interesting and they had a lot of compassion for us, while others didn't even believe any of it happened. I remember telling you how crazy it was that we met on the \_\_\_\_ server. If I had deleted my message asking you to vc, maybe none of this would have happened. I don't regret meeting you though. I look at the world a lot differently and my life has improved.

You seem happier too, especially compared to when we first met. I know a large part of that comes from leaving a miserable job, but making a friend you can be completely honest with is a relief in a world where people often lie to each other just to keep the peace.

Most of the time, I'm just speaking to a disembodied voice. It's the little moments that feel the most human and memorable to me. There was one time we were talking about ice cream at your dad's house. You were live streaming in the kitchen and the phone camera was pointed down at your legs. I remembered they were crossed nonchalantly as you were leaning against the counter--you seemed so relaxed in that moment. And then recently, there was that time you were hiking in the forest near your house and you sung that song about a soldier whose wife left him after returning from the war. I remember feeling pleasantly surprised at how nice your singing voice is when you do it earnestly. And it's such a joy hearing you laugh. I feel like it's when you're the most expressive since I rarely get to see your face.

I like having that effect on someone. The thought of someone feeling comfortable around me, knowing who I really am is just nice. That level of comfort and understanding is something I worry I'll never find in another person again. All those things you said about me being introspective and understanding are all things I could say about you. 

I'd like to stay connected with you, but in terms of a romantic relationship...I think deep down we both know distance doesn't really matter. The timing just isn't right. You're still figuring what you want to do with your life and I'm figuring out if I want to be a wife and mother. You're also highly resistant to any sort of romance and you're constantly thinking about losing the people closest to you--there's obviously fear there or some mental barrier that prevents you from opening your heart.

I'm still processing all of it. Going from tears to wishing I could make coffee for you in the morning, to doubting the legitimacy of the whole thing. And no matter who I talk to or ask for help, nobody can advise me on how to move forward. They don't know you or me, and obviously we still don't fully know ourselves. There wouldn't be so many people hurting if enough people really had it all figured out. 

Anyway, please enjoy this nice new moka pot. I specifically sought out stainless steel because I don't want you to drink any harmful chemicals that may be leaking into your coffee anymore. And I hope you like the other little gifts as well. I think it would be easier for you to keep these precious trinkets more than me. I get a bit too sentimental. 

*Merry Christmas my dear friend.*

There‚Äôs this girl I met few months back, Ava, and she sparked my interest. I asked her out and she responded well ‚Äúthat‚Äôs super fun I would love to go out together‚Äù 

So i planned for just a chill date of coffee and talking and getting to know each other and she said ‚Äúsounds fun! :)‚Äù Up until the date, we had very brief conversations and she asked what I was up to and stuff but overall just setting up the date. Day before there was a huge football game and she cold texted me asking if I was watching it and made small talk with me then ended with ‚Äúwe‚Äôll prob lose :( but tomorrow should be fun together!‚Äù 

So her interest is good. Date comes we hug talk, ask about each other, then the conversation eventually fizzles out and she hits me with the ‚Äúwell I have to go I have a lot of work to do‚Äù then we hugged again. I knew things weren‚Äôt good but texted her again day later and was thinking of a 2nd date and she responded a day later and said yes, set it up for the weekend but she cancelled day before and rescheduled to Monday but I had to take a little to think about if I wanted to further pursue and was also busy Monday. I suggested Tuesday and that‚Äôs when she said she was pretty busy these next few weeks and I said just let me know when you‚Äôre free. Obviously she never replied.

Now we bump into each other few times cus of similar groups, I say hi and she doesn‚Äôt even make eye contact with me‚Ä¶

Everyone told me date wasn‚Äôt bad and I didn‚Äôt really do anything wrong yet I feel like I fumbled and ruined it, especially since her interest was high initially. We didn‚Äôt vibe which is completely fine (1 date isn‚Äôt enough tbh) her coldness towards me makes me feel like I fucked up big time and makes me think ‚Äúwhat did I do to you‚Äù ",1,1731725505.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I'm an old person and I've only been on one cruise and never solo before.

1. Tipping: Gratuities are included, but do I tip the person who cleans my room? Is that someone different from the cabin steward? I've heard that if you're going to tip the cabin steward, do it at the end. But how do you do that? Assuming the service is good I would want to do this and if the person who cleans the room is different I'd want to tip as I would at a hotel. Is this acceptable or frowned upon? What about bartenders and servers? I have not purchased a drink package.
2. Drinking water: I don't drink soda and rarely drink alcohol. I'm a water drinker. Is tap water OK? Where's the best place to get drinkable water? I'm only bringing one suitcase so not bringing any beverages. I will bring two thermos cups though.
3. Is there coffee available all day at the Lido deck? If I want coffee first thing when I get up, do I tip for room service or is that part of the gratuities? I want to tip where applicable but not appear to be trying to buy special service.
4. How dressy is the main dining room? It's a group trip where I won't know anyone at first but the group will be dining together in the MDR. I do not wear dresses or skirts. I will have some nice black pants and dressy-ish sandals and a few lace tops.
5. I'm viewing this as a kind of ""wellness retreat."" I plan to eat healthy, go to the gym and/or walk the decks, do a lot of reading and some writing. Are the books in the library good or should I plan to bring more than one?
6. I booked fairly late so my cabin is towards the front. How much movement am I likely to feel while in the room?
7. I will probably stay on board ship at most of the ports. I have 25 Caribbean vacations under my belt in my adult life and I'm about beached out. And the excursions don't thrill me. BUT...I want to get coffee in Jamaica. Is there a duty free shop within the cruise port in Montego Bay where I can avoid the hassle of MoBay on cruise ship day?

The arts and crafts meet up I loved, because it was a way of meeting all kinds of people who are into all kinds of hobbies. I even got to sit down and do one of the hobbies with one of the fellow women in my group and we bonded over that. The whole thing is set up to take place in a cafe, so it‚Äôs a nice atmosphere and you get to have a coffee with the ladies whilst you‚Äôre doing your hobby.

I then tried out a book club, which I thoroughly enjoyed because it wasn‚Äôt like traditional book clubs where you all read the same thing and all keep at the same pace, but rather it‚Äôs like you all get to read your own individual book for an hour and talk about what you‚Äôve read afterwards together.

My best examples are See's Candy butterscotch lollipops and Lush Sticky Dates lotion.

I am not a fan of: chocolate, smoke, anything burnt, ""light"" sweets like marshmallow/milkshake/white sugar, or heavy musk.

To that end, I've found the following scents from **Lovesick Witchery** and I would love to hear some opinions from anyone who's tried them! **Date with the Devil, Half Dead Cafe, Harlot & Pumpkinhead.**

The Dream of a LIFETIME incident occurred on July 9th of 2007, a man by the name ""Schwartz Profundus"". He one night was awake for too long, fatigue production started within his body. Every night Schwartz would stay awake, time after time drinking 5 to 10 cups of coffee. The sleepiness would continue to build up, he eventually stayed awake for 3 months, dramatic and horrifying changes arrived. Doctors would notice *disturbing* changes in his behavior, Schwartz would continuously say the words ""*DREAM*"", ""*LIFETIME*"", and ""*SLEEP*"".

Doctors and psychologists never knew what Schwartz meant, they put him into a nearby mental facility for more security measures. Schwartz would continue to have a look of fear and worry on his face, the concern and terror would only grow worse throughout the next 5 months. He would start to scream so loud, his vocal chords would nearly rip and break. Schwartz would bang his head against the wall to get the guards attention, soon enough his head would bleed intensely.

Guards would try to stop Schwartz from his s\*icide attempt, but failed to do so. He eventually cracked his skull, brain matter and bone was visible. The utter horrors were seen, no human could describe such *unnatural* occurrences within him. Schwartz fell dead onto the floor soon after, unconscious and gone. Decades later, he woke up after a coma. It was 2017, Schwartz told the surgeons and doctors that he saw a ""*red cloud cluster, extending to infinite darkness, lifetime seeming.*""",1,1731724824.0,DoctorNowhere,0,1.0,False

EpicMFan : Aujourd'hui, j'ai d√©cid√© d'aller dans un bar gay. Je ne sais pas encore lequel, mais il y en a plusieurs dans le Village. Mais d'abord, je prends le m√©tro pour aller √† Beaudry. Et bien s√ªr, quelqu'un m'a reconnu et s'est approch√© de moi.

La personne du m√©tro : Bonjour, vous √™tes le membre local ?

EpicMFan : Oui, c'est moi. Comment le savez-vous ?

La personne du m√©tro : Votre visage est imm√©diatement reconnaissable.

EpicMFan : Alors, quelle est votre question ?

La personne du m√©tro : Qu'est-ce qu'il y a avec les conservateurs ? Ils ne font que se plaindre, se plaindre, se plaindre. Aucun d'entre eux ne veut faire quoi que ce soit de notable. Et ils demandent √† tous ceux qui ne sont pas eux de d√©missionner.

EpicMFan : Tout le monde d√©missionne dans un monde conservateur. C'est irritant, n'est-ce pas ?

La personne du m√©tro : Je vais vous dire. J'ai toujours soutenu le Bloc. Mais leur nouveau leader. Aya. Elle est beaucoup plus √† droite que le Bloc d'autrefois. Il n'y a qu'un seul parti qui soutient mes visions !

EpicMFan : Personnellement, j'ai toujours soutenu le NPD. Surtout avec Jack Layton. Il √©tait cool, n'est-ce pas ?

La personne du m√©tro : Oui, c'est vrai. Et aussi, leur chef adjoint d√©teste les droits des femmes, y compris leur propre chef, putain ! J'ai besoin d'un verre apr√®s tout √ßa. Surtout que ma femme a avort√©.

EpicMFan : Bon, c'est mon arr√™t. Je ferais mieux de partir. Je vous souhaite bonne chance.

*EpicMFan se rend dans le premier bar gay qu'il trouve, appel√© Le Date.*

*EpicMFan chante la chanson ¬´ Headline News ¬ª de ¬´ Weird Al ¬ª Yankovic.*

EpicMFan : C'√©tait sympa. Prenons un verre et voyons ce que les gens en pensent.

*EpicMFan se dirige vers un barman.*

EpicMFan : Vous avez des boissons sans alcool ?

Le barman : J'ai du caf√© alcoolis√©.

EpicMFan : C'est alcoolis√©. Dites-moi, que pensez-vous de la position des conservateurs sur les LGBT ?

Le barman : C'est absolument terrible. Je veux dire qu'ils ont un chef adjoint qui s'est oppos√© √† nous √† plusieurs reprises. Pour peu de raisons. Tout simplement parce que nous voulons √™tre ce que nous sommes.

EpicMFan : J'ai une fille transgenre, en fait, et je dirais que sous un gouvernement conservateur, elle ne pourrait jamais obtenir le soutien, l'≈ìstrog√®ne, tout ce qu'il faut.

Le barman : Je dois dire que les r√©centes nouvelles concernant les syndicats m'ont pris au d√©pourvu. Je fais √©videmment partie du syndicat du secteur priv√©, mais le syndicat du secteur public... il faut avoir piti√© de lui, non ? Parce que si ce n'est pas le cas, qu'est-ce que vous feriez ?

EpicMFan : Je ne sais pas... ce sont eux qui l'ont signal√©. Personnellement, j'en ai entendu parler et je suis solidaire des travailleurs dans cette situation. Surtout ceux qui sont soumis √† un environnement dangereux parce qu'ils sont LGBT.

Le barman : C'est difficile maintenant. Les meilleurs jours sont derri√®re nous. Mais les meilleurs jours sont aussi dans l'avenir.

EpicMFan : Il se fait tard et je dois √™tre au studio √† 9h45... √† plus tard.

Le barman : Au revoir.

EpicMFan: Today, I decided to go to a gay bar. I don't know which one yet, but there's a bunch in The Village. But first, I'm catching the Metro to get to Beaudry. And of course, somebody recognised me and came up to me.

Metro Person: Hi, are you my local member?

EpicMFan: Why, yes I am. How could you tell?

Metro Person: Your face is instantly recognisable.

EpicMFan: So, what's your question?

Metro Person: What is it with Conservatives? All they do is complain, complain, complain. None of them want to do anything of note. And they all call on everyone who isn't them to resign.

EpicMFan: Everyone resigns in a Tory world. It's irritating, isn't it?

Metro Person: I'll tell you what. I used to always support the Bloc. But their new leader. Aya. She's a lot more right wing than the Bloc of old. Only one party is supporting my visions!

EpicMFan: I personally was always an NDP supporter. Especially with Jack Layton. He was cool, wasn't he?

Metro Person: Yeah. And also, their deputy leader hates the rights of women, including their own fucking leader! I need a drink after all this. Especially considering my wife had an abortion.

EpicMFan: Well, this is my stop. I best be off. Best to you.

*EpicMFan goes to the first gay bar he finds, called Le Date.*

EpicMFan: This is Le Date, reportedly. A karaoke bar. I guess I could sing a song. But I'm not showing any of you.

*EpicMFan sings the song 'Headline News' by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic.*

EpicMFan: That was fun. Let's have a drink and see what people think.

*EpicMFan walks to a bartender.*

EpicMFan: You have any non-alcoholic drinks?

Bartender: I have alcoholic coffee.

EpicMFan: That's alcoholic. Tell me, what do you think about the Conservative's stance on LGBT?

Bartender: Absolutely terrible. I mean, they've got a deputy leader who has on multiple occasions gone against us. For little reason. Just because we wanna be who we are.

EpicMFan: I have a transgender daughter, in fact, and I would say that under a Conservative government she would never be able to get the support, the estrogen, the everything.

Bartender: I must say, the recent news about the unions struck me off guard. Obviously I'm part of the private sector union, but that public sector union... you best feel sorry for them, no? Because if not, then what would you do?

EpicMFan: I dunno... they're the ones reporting it. I personally did hear about it, and I stand in solidarity with the workers in this situation. Especially those who are put under an unsafe environment because they're LGBT.

While in school, I spent four years working as a paid research assistant. Prior to that, I worked for two years doing similar work in high school. I also participated in four summer internships: two in physics research, one in software engineering, and one in data science. I also worked as both a teaching assistant and a tutor at my university.

I started job searching mid last summer after having caught wind of horror stories about people having graduated one, two, and even three years prior and not having yet found any meaningful work. I have since submitted just over 1,200 job applications, and haven‚Äôt yet found anything. I‚Äôve interviewed for two positions, and have received around 800 automated rejection emails.¬†

I‚Äôve re-written my resume five times. I currently have three different ‚Äústyles‚Äù of resume, each with a different level of complexity (for something like fast-food, I submit a ‚Äúdumbed down variant‚Äù; for technical jobs in industry, I reframe my research experience in more marketable terms; for work in academia, I speak more specifically to my research interests). I‚Äôve run all three by former bosses, professors, and (now twice) by my university‚Äôs career center.

I spend a significant amount of time (10-14 hours a day, across 1 or 2 applications) carefully tailoring my resume and cover letters. Some applications take days or weeks, with assignments, assessments, projects, essays and more involved. I reach out to recruiters, alumni, and others within the companies I apply to wherever possible. I have also sent hundreds of ‚Äúcold-emails‚Äù, whose format I‚Äôve also run by former bosses and the aforementioned career center. I am extremely careful so as to verify that I meet every single one of the listed requirements on each job posting. I have six references, from which I randomly pick 2-3 (and in some cases, I‚Äôve been asked for all 6) for each application so as to ensure that one or two references aren‚Äôt somehow getting in the way (I can‚Äôt imagine that any have anything less than positive to say, but I‚Äôm trying everything at this point).

I can‚Äôt seem to get a job doing *anything*. I‚Äôve been rejected for minimum wage, $7.25/hr fast-food jobs. I‚Äôve been rejected for research assistant jobs very similar to the same research assistant jobs I had as a student. A non-exhaustive list of industries and jobs I‚Äôve tried:

* Universities

* City governments
* The federal government
* Pharmaceutical companies
* The airlines

They fit nicely in corners or smaller rooms without crowding the space. Plus, their dual functionality as both a recliner and rocker means you can save room while still enjoying luxury.

### Health Benefits

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/rocker-recliner-loveseat  
  
- **Improved Circulation:** The rocking motion encourages blood flow, which can reduce discomfort in your legs and back.
- **Reduced Stress:** The gentle rocking motion is soothing and can help alleviate stress and anxiety after a hectic day.
- **Back Support:** Reclining positions can take pressure off your spine, offering better lumbar support, which is especially beneficial for those with back pain.

### Enhanced Family Time

A rocker recliner loveseat is perfect for quality time with loved ones. Its cozy design encourages you to snuggle up next to family members. Whether it's movie night, game day, or simply chatting over coffee, this loveseat fosters a warm and inviting atmosphere. The ability to rock or recline adds a fun element to your gatherings, making them even more enjoyable.

### Easy Maintenance

Maintaining your rocker recliner loveseat can be simple, especially if you choose the right material. Many fabric options are removable and washable, while leather can be wiped down with ease. To ensure longevity:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/rocker-recliner-loveseat  
  
- Regularly vacuum to remove dust and debris.
- Use a protective spray on fabric upholstery to resist stains.

### Affordability and Value

Rocker recliner loveseats are often more affordable than larger sectional options while still providing great style and comfort. When you compare the price with the features you get, such as reclining capability and rocking motion, you truly receive great value for your investment.

### Customization Options

Many manufacturers offer rocker recliner loveseats with customization options, allowing you to select the fabric, color, and additional features such as heat and massage functions.

Choosing the Perfect Style: Key Factors in Selecting a Rocker Recliner Loveseat for Your Home
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to finding the ideal seating solution for your living space, a rocker recliner loveseat deserves your attention. This piece of furniture combines the comfort of a recliner with the gentle motion of a rocking chair, making it a perfect choice for relaxation and bonding moments with family or friends. Here, we‚Äôll discuss key factors to consider when selecting the perfect rocker recliner loveseat for your home.

### Comfort Level

Your comfort is the top priority. When trying out rocker recliner loveseats, take the time to sit down and get a feel for it. Check the following:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/rocker-recliner-loveseat  
  
- Seat Depth: Make sure the seat depth suits your height. A deeper seat might be more relaxing, while a shallower one could be better for shorter individuals.
- Back Support: Ensure the backrest provides adequate support for your lumbar region. A well-padded back can make all the difference in comfort.
- Cushion Firmness: The firmness of cushions influences comfort. Some prefer soft cushions, while others like a firmer feel.

### Size and Space

Measuring your available space is crucial. A loveseat can vary in size, so here‚Äôs what to keep in mind:

- Room Dimensions: Ensure the rocker recliner loveseat fits comfortably within your room without overwhelming the space.
- Doorway and Pathways: Check that the loveseat can enter your home and fit through doorways without trouble.
- Placement: Consider how the loveseat will fit into your living arrangement. It should complement other pieces in the room.

### Material and Durability

The material of your rocker recliner loveseat greatly affects its lifespan and maintenance. Here are common options to consider:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/rocker-recliner-loveseat  
  
- Fabric: Soft and cozy, fabric loveseats come in many colors and patterns. However, they might require regular cleaning.
- Leather: While often more expensive, leather provides durability and elegance. It‚Äôs easy to wipe clean but can be sensitive to heat and sunlight.
- Microfiber: A great middle ground, microfiber is stain-resistant and comfortable, making it an ideal choice for homes with kids or pets.

### Style and Aesthetics

Your rocker recliner loveseat should reflect your personal style and fit in with your home decor. Consider the following factors:

- Color: Choose a color that complements your existing furniture and walls. Neutral tones can blend effortlessly, while bold colors can create a statement.
- Design: From traditional to modern, select a design that aligns with your style. Sleek lines and minimalist designs might suit contemporary homes, while ornate details work well in classic settings.
- Functionality: Think about additional features like built-in cup holders, USB charging ports, or adjustable reclining levels that make the loveseat more functional.

### Function and Usage

Think about how you will use the loveseat. Is it for lounging, movie nights, or accommodating guests? Here‚Äôs what to assess:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/rocker-recliner-loveseat  
  
- Daily Use: If you plan to use it every day, focus on durability and ease of cleaning.
- Occasional Use: A stylish loveseat that looks great may suffice if it won‚Äôt see much action.
- Support Features: If you have any physical challenges, look for models with enhanced support or easier recline functionality.

### Price and Warranty

Budget is a significant factor. You don‚Äôt have to break the bank, but you should consider:

- Cost-Effectiveness: Balance quality with price. Sometimes, investing a little more in a durable loveseat pays off in the long run.
- Warranty Options: Look into warranties that protect your investment. A good warranty can offer peace of mind and protection against defects.

Finding the right rocker recliner loveseat involves considering comfort, space, materials, style, functionality, and budget. By carefully evaluating these factors, you can choose a piece that enhances your home while providing the ultimate in relaxation.

1gsde63,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gsde63/toxic_gf_or_am_i_an_asshole/,Toxic GF or am I an asshole?,"I just had a pretty shitty end of day with my girlfriend. We have been together for 5.5years now so we are quite deep into the relationship. The thing I'm struggling with at the moment is that every nice thing I do is appreciated for a second, but every thing I do that isn't 100% in her favour means that I get labelled as a shitty boyfriend. For example today. It was her birthday so this is how the day went:

0700: We wake up and I give her gifts (Jewellery) with a freshly brewed coffee in bed.

0730: I make her breakfast and we eat together at the breakfast bar and discuss plans for the weekend.

0800 - 1630: I start work. She has the day because that's how her shifts fell and I had used all my leave earlier in the year to travel to the Philippines for her mother's funeral, so I didn't have the ability to take it off. But I work from home so I check in with her through the day, she's pampering herself and chilling. I start and finish early because we have a dinner reservation.

1700: I drive us to the train station to go into town.

1730: Sit down to a three course meal with good wine in one of the fanciest restaurants in town. All on me of course.

2000-2200: We head to the bar and have more wine and chat for a while.

I ask if we can cut the night short. As Im tired after the long week in work and we have plans tomorrow to go out again partying anyway. She throws a paddy, saying ""I only care about myself and I never do nice things for her"". That I should go home by myself and she will stay out.

I literally am at her beck and call on a daily basis. She gets home from work there's a hot homecooked meal ready. She needs a lift to go out with her friends, my only question is ""when?"". She says ""I want to do X, we go do X, normally with me booking and arranging everything"", she says I'd like some dessert tonight, I go out to the shops. 

On top of this she does some nice things for me but only while she is doing them for herself.  For example, when she is getting ready for work, she wakes up early 5am and makes herself a coffee and puts the bedroom lights on so she can do her makeup, waking me up in the process. If I ask, she will pour me a mug as part of this routine. And I always show gratitude. But she doesn't let me forget it if she doesn't get her way on something at some other time. Her shift pattern normally means she has 4 full days off a week (I get the two weekend days and have more time in the evenings). On her days off she will invariably spend the morning cleaning because she likes the house to be spotless. I completely appreciate this and always say the house looks amazing. It's not an expectation I have or anything but I'd never diminish how nice it is that she does this. Butttt it always ends up being something she guilt trips me with and tries to make out that I'm not pulling my weight (completely ignoring that I keep the house tidy and do all the household chores on the 4days of the week that she is in work. I work at home so you know I give up my lunch breaks and my time in the evenings before she gets home to keep things up to scratch.

I know it's a lot above and I know it's only one side of the relationship. I just feel so underappreciated. I constantly feel like I am doing stuff just to avoid being put down. And I always have to compromise what I want to fit with what she wants. 

I just don't know if I'm being an asshole about all this or whether this is actually really unhealthy? I've tried to talk about it but it always just gets spun into a competition of who does the most, where anything I do doesn't count.",1,1731724240.0,dating,5,1.0,False

I knew things weren‚Äôt good but texted her again day later and was thinking of a 2nd date and she responded a day later and said yes, set it up for the weekend but she cancelled day before and rescheduled to Monday but I had to take a little to think about if I wanted to further pursue and was also busy Monday. I suggested Tuesday and that‚Äôs when she said she was pretty busy these next few weeks and I said just let me know when you‚Äôre free. Obviously she never replied.

Now we bump into each other few times cus of similar groups, I say hi and she doesn‚Äôt even make eye contact with me‚Ä¶

Everyone told me date wasn‚Äôt bad and I didn‚Äôt really do anything wrong yet I feel like I fumbled and ruined it, especially since her interest was high initially.

So everyone is complaining about morals this and moral that, but let‚Äôs talk economics here. I‚Äôve since moved into furniture sales, so I can only give insight from my area of expertise, but these prospective tariffs are about to seriously fuck us over. Most furniture in the US (or at least in my company) is imported from manufacturers in Southeast Asia. China is also included. 

Ok, no big deal, furniture is gonna get expensive, but who can afford a house anyways? 

Does anyone realize how much shit comes from Southeast Asia? Electronics? Clothing? Out of season crops? Seafood? The wood we use for construction? The metal? The stone? Every single American industry imports something from across the world. And if it‚Äôs truly 100% American sourced, then it‚Äôs gonna be hella expensive. 

So yeah. Ok, prices are gonna go up. But hey as a salesman; if my prices go up, then I guess that means more money for me right? Well if I made commission; sure, but the cost of living also goes up, and likely I won‚Äôt be able to afford rent, and food, and clothing, and everything else I already struggle with. And that‚Äôs the best case scenario. 

The worst case is already in process. They‚Äôve started a hiring freeze in my company. No more new hires, coffee machine is being removed, oh and we know your understaffed already, but that just means yall will make more money. (For us they whisper)

Can you help me out?,"This thing might get long, so just a heads up. There's a lot of extra info for me to get through for this to make sense, i think. So feel free to Not read this and move on! I don't wanna be a bother. 

So, I've never even touched reddit or anything, but I don't think there's anyone else I can ask about this at this point, so I'll set the scene.

As a prolog: In elementary school I had hardly any friends, because I was, like, a freak, right. Until in 7th grade (we went from 1st to 8th grade from like 7 to 15 years old) I actually started talking to people and it was great! For two years until they all turned on me and left me for a stupid reason I won't get into now. So going into high school basically alone wasn't fun, but fuck it, I had hope. And I did make like one friend so that was chill but this isn't about her.

Back in the second grade of highschool one of the more popular girls in our class reached out to me and my (at the time) best friend and we quickly hit it off. All three of us were like inseparable but me and her especially.

It felt like she really understood me after all this time. She needed physical contact as much as I did (we held hands like all the time ppl thought we were dating, I think), we were both into that stupid minecraft server and marvel and we both loved talking about boys, because we were stereotypical like that. She found me funny and she listened to me. 

And of course she had her flaws, right. She was a straight cis girl that had trouble understanding who I was (genderfluid, panromantic, asexual), but the thing is that instead dismissing me or ignoring it she made an effort to TRY and understand me. I knew that the reasons she had trouble getting it was because she was in an entirely different environment all her life, so I didn't mind.
She had trouble understanding that sometimes the things she said were offensive, but I made an effort to help her and she listened. And she learned! She got so much kinder and more understanding, it was great.

We had sleepovers frequently, I'd go to her house every day after school and we'd talk about anything. Or even just sit in silence. I played boardgames with her dad, that was fun. 

I even got her to roleplay with me! She was super iffy about it, had never done it before and thought it was cringe. But I convinced her to make some ocs and me and our other friend roleplayed together with her for a bit, until me and PG(Popular Girl lets call her, she still was) had to split from BF(best friend, previously mentioned) since she didn't have as much time as us. So we spent every day roleplaying nonstop. During every break, during class, whenever. She got so invested in it. Every time I didn't respond for a couple hours she got so impatient. And we both loved pur characters so much. We did this for months. Years even actually, I think. This meant a lot to me, for also unrelated reasons. (unless you rlly wanna know but yeah)

She even got me to text the guy I liked at the time. She supported me even though she thought he was ugly and even though it didn't work out. But it's an experience I still fondly remember.

She was such a comfort to me. I knew she might be leaving to study abroad and it upset me so deeply because she was like home to me. She was someone I could talk about anything with and who I could hold whenever I needed it. And she got me to leave my house. And made an effort to come to my town. Even though we only knew eachother for like 2 years.

But no friendship ever lasts forever with me, and here's where my issue starts.

At some point during the end of our 3rd year and start of the 4th year of high school, BF started getting really paranoid. There were these guys at our school that scared her. Not because they were dangerous or anything. just because they were mean. She was terrified they'd make fun of her or even look at her, stuff like that.

And on our group chat she'd often bring up these concerns. I'd try to help her as best I could, not assume anything and just try to calm her down, but she'd snap at me anyway.

And sadly PG was even WORSE at giving advice and comforting people than I was. I hadn't managed to teach her how to be gentle yet, my bad.

They'd get into regular arguments over it, which led BF to leave our group chat like all the time.

Both of them grew more and more frustrated with eachother. PG couldn't deal with BFs anxiety, so she distanced herself from me and her at times to talk to her other friends while I had to stay behind, because I couldn't leave BF with noone to talk to. I didn't blame either of them for this and I didn't mind, because I loved them both. 

This continued for a while, but we were all still friends and would reconcile at the end of the day. 

Until one day it led to PG ditching me and BF to go and hang out with a bunch of other people for new years. She lied to me about why she made that choice which frustrated me, but I forgave her. BF wasn't as happy, though, but I tried to convince her otherwise.

Atleast me and her could meet for new years, right?

Like literally a day before christmas me and BF got into a huge argument. She got unreasonably angry at me for a stupid joke. (I said ""new year same me im not changing for shit"" in the middle of a conversation and she said that ""maybe i should""[because we were meant to go to college soon and she thought I was lazy] so we spiraled into an argument)

This lasted until after new years. I spent it alone.

We were avoiding eachother at school, until PG actually made the effort to speak to BF and they both came up to me so she could apologize. I'm quick to forgive, we were back to normal.

For a week or two.

After that, BF and PG fought about those stupid fucking guys again. And we are coming up on the mistake that I made.

They weren't speaking to eachother. PG was basically only talking to her other friends and rarely me. Doesn't help she got a boyfriend at the time and stopped talking to me about him. I think her old friends were influencing her again.

I still talked to BF, tried to be normal. One day I texted her to try and get them to speak to eachother again, to make up.

BF instead went on a whole rant about how selfish and egotistical PG was. She said some mean shit because she was frustrated.

I tried to relay the valuable information hidden between insults to PG.

But she cut me off and asked me to just send her screenshots instead.

And I did. Like a fucking idiot.

I panicked and I did because I was already emotional.

Obviously PG was hurt. She told me she never wanted to talk to BF again and that their friendship was over. I tried to be comforting, I don't know if it worked.

I told BF what happened and she didn't care.

PG stopped talking to us. I mean she texted me sometimes but it was scarce. And when I spoke up her responses were barely there. Short and dismissive. (stopped roleplaying, also)

I still talked to BF, because I couldn't leave her. She was sad, she was struggling and she was alone aside from me. I couldn't just ditch her. Maybe that's what made PG hate me, I don't know yet.

After a few days I asked PG what was wrong and if we could work it out. We talked a bit and she started getting aggressive with me. She started blaming me. She said I was the one not talking to her. I told her I wasn't comfortable just coming up to people out of nowhere and trying to talk to them, I didn't know how. She said I should just get over it and get out of my comfort zone.

I asked her if she didn't care about my feelings at all and she said that yeah, she doesn't. 

I cried then and I told her to go fuck herself. It was harsh, but I panicked.

This was just before prom. It felt like something was missing the entire time. I still had fun but I wish that she would've spoken to me then instead of looking at me with resentment.

Time skip to now. High school is over. I took a gap year because I needed a break.

But now most of my friends are in college, busy. I either don't text them because I don't want to bother them or when I do they just don't respond.
My other friends either have other, better friend groups, or are just so sad that I can't handle helping them every day. Or burdening them with my problems, so I'm explaining this to you now instead.

I still follow PG on instagram. I saw her post about watching movies with some college friends recently. And meeting up with our old classmate for coffee. And I started to get sad, obviously.

I read through pur old rp groups while looking for something too, those were so fun. There's so many things I would've done better, but I can't now.

Read through some of our regular gc too, that stung. Shouldn't have done that. We were gonna live together and see eachothers weddings or whatever else she said.

So I was just... Wondering. 

If maybe I should say sorry?

I'm not expecting anything to come of it, really. Or maybe I am.

But ending such a good thing on such a terrible note really makes me upset. It makes me feel so guilty. Most of my friendships have ended on a sour note but this one really fucking hurts for whatever reason.

I think I should say sorry because I handled that situation so terribly. When me and BF were fighting, PG pulled through and helped us get along, but when I had to do it I ruined our friendship forever. I feel like I fucked it up for BF too.

Or maybe I should just ask her if she can mute our rp group chat so I can talk about my characters there. That would be nice to have. But I'm scared she'll just ignore me then. Or tell me to fuck off or something.

Extra context, though: I haven't left the house for like 3 months. I haven't met up with anyone aside from family once. I have only one friend to talk to and he's so sad that most days I choose not to because I'm so tired of trying to help and failing. I only really talk to my brother when he comes home from college and my parents sometimes. But that's about it.
I guess I post online which is fun, but yeah. It seems its not enough.

So maybe all this regret is the isolation talking. Maybe I need like a cat or something. I have a snake she's not very... huggable.

Anyway sorry for making you sit through all that! I'm an aspiring writer, can you tell?

This was kind of nice to get off my chest, though. It kind of helped? Not fully, obviously, because I'm still gonna post it, but a little.

Thank you for your attention! I love you! Truly, I hope you're alright.",1,1731723379.0,lostafriend,0,0.99,False
