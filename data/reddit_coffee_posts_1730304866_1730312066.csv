I recently purchased the red andiamo replica bag from Baobao, and I am beyond impressed! Comparing it to the authentic fondant, the quality is outstanding. The craftsmanship on the red bag is so well-done that it feels nearly identical in texture and design. The weaving is tightly done, giving it a luxurious look and feel, and the gold hardware is stunning and feels high-quality.

What truly made this experience exceptional was Baobao‚Äôs customer service. They were attentive, responsive, and went out of their way to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase. The bag arrived quickly and was carefully packaged, reflecting Baobao‚Äôs dedication to quality and customer care.

If you‚Äôre looking for a high-quality replica, I can‚Äôt recommend Baobao enough. This red bag has all the elegance and sophistication of the authentic version, at a fraction of the price! A fantastic experience from start to finish.

REVIEW TEXT:
‚óè Quality numeric rating and assessment - 10/10 - I bought the authentic just for comparison and as can be seen in the photos, there are no differences. Hubby actually picked the authentic as the rep. Leather quality are equally as supple and glossy. Texture is the same and smell also. 
‚óè Accuracy numeric rating and assessment compared to the auth or factory pic - 10/10 - as above mentioned. 
‚óè Satisfaction numeric rating and assessment - 9.8/10. Giving 9.8 because the dustbag was slightly different as can be seen in the pictures. 
‚óè Service and/or Communication numeric rating and assessment.- 10/10.¬†Communication with Baobao was excellent from beginning to end. What a joy to deal with. Always cheerful and respectful.

1gft2m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gft2m4/getting_ex_back/,Getting ex back,"Hello guys,

So i am in a breakup with my ex. I would describe her as passionate, reasonable, ultra sexy but grounded girl, with some kinds of traumas (which she share with me before and some more details after our breakup).

This is unfortunately our second breakup. 2 years together, year before, I fucked up massively. She has felt betrayed. There was no cheating and im absolutely sure from both sides. Just a lot of ""filling the gaps of understanding with our insecurities"" due to lack of deep communication. Sometimes we'd have deep talks, but sometimes it lacked proper understanding (mostly from my side). We got back together after 3 weeks of separ√°tn√≠, first 2 weeks of no contact due to that I was blocked everywhere. She packed her things while i was out with my family outside of city we live in. And yeah, i begged, pleaded, sent letter etc... she started to miss me 2 weeks later and she saw, that i was becoming a better person. We got together quite easily. 


 I often felt depressed and desperate, because i hate my job. But, it improved... until i just burned out this year (may-+)... we had a holiday trip to exotic destination and we both relied to that as ""magic cure"" to all our problems outside + inside relationship problems... yeah, that was silly.

So, after returning from holiday, i tried to work in my old job, after week, i just couldn't bear it anymore. So i stayed home due to medical reasons (so still 60% income). She works in school, so she had some kind of summer holidays, but then she eventu√°lnƒõ started to work. I gave her lifts to and from her workplace, kept our apartment tidy etc... but i was so emotionally closed off, she even tried to help me, but i was so closed off, that hurt her (i was almost always open to talk about anything, especially resolving problems).. so she left me about a month ago. It was civilised breakup, almost 5hr straight of talking, no SMS breakup, proper face2face breakup.

I let her live in our shared apartment, she pays her contribution, i paid mine but i left to stay some time with my parents. I couldnt be there alone due to massive constant anxiety.

We see each other 1wk after breakup, then after 2 weeks. We didnt text much. In the first week, we had some good interactions over text, then she sharply pull back. She told me to just discuss practic info about our flat, cat and etc... but offered a meetup next week then..

We met up, i felt i need to apologize for some things in order to drop pressure between us. She agreed and it indeed dropped some pressure.

Then the following weekend, she called me, to do her a favor. Financial favor. I was hesitant, but ok, it wasnt so much money after all, and she told me if I want, it would be fine to meetup next monday. We did. Her Mother is not doing well, because her bussines died and she needs to move out too due to lack of income. I came with some cakes for a coffe, and we met together. Me, my ex and her Mother. I just became her mother's emotional support, offered her help with moving, and we just discussed some things, she and me felt better afterwards. Her Mother told me, that she likes me, thanked me for support, hugged me and etc... she also told me, that she doesn't know whats between my ex and me, but that she's glad i came.

Then me and my ex went for some shopping (for our cat mostly), and then went for a coffee in our flat. That was the first time after breakup, we were discussing the breakup, causes, our feelings and etc. We had an agreement before, that i want to spend some days in our flat too, so we can share it - but not together (she would sleep in her moms flat/bussines place meanwhile). But, she offered shes ok with both of us being there. Basically like before. She keeps her distance etc, cuz she told me, shes afraid that if we reconcile, things would go down bad after time again. Shes also stalks my stories and etc..

Since the breakup, i really started to pushing things for better in me. I almost instantly got a new job which i really like, im not depressed nor desperate, little bit anxious yeah (i have GAD), but nothing crippling... basically im working hard on myself to become a better man, not to just get her back, but for me to improve, as my old me would not be a great partner for anybody.... ofc, to be honest part of me is doing this to get her back... not with BS act, but really to make lasting changes in me for good... and my question is:

Is this living back together a good oppoturnity to show her she would be not walking back to the same relationship? Could this offer be cautious move from her to ""test drive"" it with possible rekindling after? I know her well, shes cautious. She doesn't wanna another heartbreak again. But i delt deep inside, shes hiding her feelings and this might be the way to take things slowly. We are connecting well on emotional level, very active listening from both sides. So, is this a good sign/idea in your honest opinion?

She's really worth it. Our relationship, despite its problems was very, very special for both of us (as we told ourselves many times before breakup and once after). 

Please, be kind and reply seriously. 

Thank you guys a lot.",1,1730311616.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1gfsvfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1gfsvfp/from_rsoundmap_you_disgust_me/,From r/Soundmap -> You disgust me.,"To the person who rejected my trade and sent me a ‚ÄúüòÇ‚Äù, this is for you. It‚Äôs incredibly infuriating when someone dismisses my genuine trade offer on Soundmap with a mocking ""üòÇ"" emoji. Do you think it's funny? I hope your crayons melt in the sun, and your favorite pair of socks gets a hole in the toe.

Trading on Soundmap takes effort, thought, and a bit of trust. When I take the time to craft an offer, only to receive your smug little laugh, it‚Äôs like spitting in my face. I hope every time you eat cereal, your milk is just a little too warm, and your toast always lands butter-side down.

I don't just throw out offers willy-nilly. I consider value, fairness, and what you might actually want. Your ""üòÇ"" tells me that my effort wasn't even worth a moment's serious consideration. May your pencils always break when you're writing something important, and may your favorite TV shows always buffer at the worst moments.

Why not just decline politely? Or better yet, offer a counterproposal? Instead, you chose to be dismissive and condescending. I hope your Wi-Fi cuts out right when you‚Äôre about to win an online game, and that you step on a Lego every morning.

A respectful decline or a constructive comment would be far better. But no, you had to send a ""üòÇ"". May all your pens run out of ink halfway through writing, and may your phone battery die just as you need it most.

The level of disrespect you‚Äôve shown with that emoji is staggering. It‚Äôs not just a simple rejection; it‚Äôs a mockery of my time and effort. I hope every meal you eat is just slightly overcooked, and that every drink you take is lukewarm. I hope your umbrella always flips inside out when it rains, and that your shoelaces snap when you're in a hurry.

You might think that sending a ""üòÇ"" emoji is harmless, but it's a direct insult to the effort I've put in. It‚Äôs a way of saying that my offer, my time, and my thoughts are worth nothing to you. May your car always have a mysterious rattle that no mechanic can fix, and may you always get stuck in the slowest checkout line at the grocery store.

There‚Äôs a certain level of courtesy expected in any negotiation, whether it‚Äôs in person or online. Your ""üòÇ"" emoji breaks that unspoken rule of decency. I hope every sweater you own shrinks in the wash, and that you always have a hangnail. May your favorite book always have the last page missing, and your phone screen always have a smudge that won‚Äôt come off.

When I see that ""üòÇ"" emoji, it feels like a slap in the face. It‚Äôs a signal that my offer wasn‚Äôt even worth considering, let alone responding to politely. I hope every movie you watch has a crucial scene spoiled beforehand, and that your shoes always give you blisters. May your pillows always be too lumpy, and your alarm clock fail to go off when you need it most.

Trading on Soundmap should be a respectful exchange, but your reaction makes it clear that you don‚Äôt value that principle. I hope your internet connection is always just a little too slow for streaming, and that your glasses are always smudged. May every pen you use explode in your pocket, and your favorite shirt always get stained.

It‚Äôs not just about the rejection; it‚Äôs about the way you‚Äôve chosen to deliver it. That ""üòÇ"" emoji is a form of ridicule that undermines the entire purpose of the platform. I hope your favorite mug always has coffee drips down the side, and that your headphones always have one side that doesn‚Äôt work. May your most important emails always go to spam, and your favorite songs always skip.

I wish people on Soundmap could be more considerate and respectful. A simple ""no, thank you"" or a counteroffer would go a long way. Instead, you chose mockery. I hope your mail always gets lost, and your favorite restaurant always has a long wait. May your phone always die right when you need to make an important call, and your computer always crash when you haven‚Äôt saved your work.

That ""üòÇ"" emoji isn‚Äôt just a laugh; it‚Äôs a statement of disdain. It‚Äôs a way of saying that my effort is laughable to you. I hope your shoes always squeak, and that your keys always get stuck in the lock. May your favorite TV shows always be on hiatus, and your candles always burn unevenly.

If you think that sending a ""üòÇ"" emoji is a harmless joke, think again. It‚Äôs a direct insult to the effort and thought I put into my offer. I hope your ice cream always melts before you can enjoy it, and that your popcorn is always burned. May your favorite pen always be missing, and your light bulbs always flicker.

The dismissive nature of that emoji is what makes it so infuriating. It‚Äôs not just a rejection; it‚Äôs a mockery of my attempt to engage in a fair trade. I hope your shoelaces always come untied, and that your coffee is always too hot. May your car always be low on gas, and your favorite chair always be uncomfortable.

In a community like Soundmap, mutual respect is key. Your ""üòÇ"" emoji shows a lack of that respect. I hope your favorite team always loses, and that your plants always wilt. May your headphones always tangle, and your favorite show always be spoiled.

That ""üòÇ"" emoji is more than just a laugh; it‚Äôs a symbol of your disdain for my effort. I hope your showers are always cold, and that your socks never match. May your favorite book always be out of stock, and your favorite movie always be sold out.

To sum it up, your ""üòÇ"" emoji is a slap in the face to anyone who puts genuine effort into a trade offer. It reflects poorly on you and creates a hostile trading environment. I hope your printer always jams, and your keys always get lost. A little decency and respect can go a long way, but it seems you have none to spare.

So I've decided to do something about it. I'm 37 and know how to cook, kinda.  Currently my cooking ""style"" is, this is what I have available lemme throw some stuff together and see how it turns out.  Due to a new job I'll be more on my own, which forces 1 major change, and allows for a second. We'll start with he second, I'll be able to make food for myself without forcing my dietary plans on someone else. This is a good thing. The forced change however I'm at a loss. I need to shop for myself.

 So I'll soon be moving literally half way across the country and living in a camper for what is currently a 2 year contract. Obviously some weekends and holidays I'll be returning home, but in the meantime, I need find a crash course in shopping for myself, with limited storage space.

 My goal is to drop 100 lbs, and dietitians and doctors are recommending a low carb diet. Talked to in person not just internet research. Not quite keto but not far off from it. They want me under 70g of carbs/ day.  So what I'm after is a good list of the ""basics"" things that you'd expect any responsible adult to have on hand in a kitchen pref keto friendly options, but not mandatory. 

As I said I'll be living in a motor home. So my space will be very limited. currently my list is the bare bones, Meats, veggies, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. Olive oil. I have found some low carb pastas, and breads, but struggling to find a rice substitute that is not cauliflower. 

Currently after help with:  
Rice sub that is not cauliflower  
Other spices I should have to cover the bulk of dishes with minimal substitutions   
Which spices I can get whole for longevity but are still shelf stable.   
Anything else I may have missed that I should have on hand.

Available cooking stuffs.  
Camping cast iron camp set with a frying pan, pot with lid, Dutch oven, and a griddle pan.  
Large mixing bowl

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù Alex blinked. Having his routine interrupted was unexpected, putting his mind in a feedback loop. It took several seconds for him to snap out of it. ‚ÄúHelen who?‚Äù

‚ÄúKracow,‚Äù Will whispered.

‚ÄúMiss Perfect?‚Äù Alex sounded impressed. ‚ÄúBro! Mad rizz! You into her?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat can you tell me about her?‚Äù

‚ÄúErr. Well, her family‚Äôs rich and Asian‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused.

That was only partially true. Having Kracow for a family name had posed some questions on the first day of high school. From what Helen herself had explained at the time, her father had been adopted by a family of Polish immigrants who‚Äôd given him the name. It was one of those interesting stories that a person remembered even years later. It was also not what Will was interested in.

‚ÄúOther than that?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúWhat do you want to know, bro? She‚Äôs good in class, got money and three brothers‚Ä¶ I heard they beat up the last guy that tried to get close to her.‚Äù

That was a rather good question. What exactly did Will want to know? Even with Alex, who was a walking Wikipedia of gossip, some clarifications were necessary. Should he start with her interests? Her family? Her friends?

‚ÄúWho does she hang out with?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome of the queen bees, some of the other class reps‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs a regular at the public speaking club. She hasn‚Äôt hooked up with anyone.‚Äù He gave Will a sly smile. ‚ÄúOh, she hates geek stuff, so don‚Äôt bring up any manga, or games, or‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHas she been acting weirdly lately?‚Äù

‚ÄúMiss Perfect? No way, bro,‚Äù Alex said confidently. ‚ÄúWhat you hear?‚Äù he added in a whisper.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just that she always arrives first, and other stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúYep. First to go, last to leave.‚Äù

The conversation quickly devolved into tangentially related trivial gossip. It seemed that Helen was one topic Alex didn‚Äôt know much about. If the girl had any secrets, they were well hidden. Interestingly enough, the goofball was more than happy to spill the secrets of half a dozen people who‚Äôd tried to date her and had gotten shot down. Helen didn‚Äôt seem to be in any relations, or even be remotely interested in anyone. Her grades were exemplary, but she hadn‚Äôt discussed any plans for college. As far as anyone could tell, she was just the name on top of the grades leaderboard.

With five minutes left until the end of the loop, Will decided to wait it out. There wasn‚Äôt much he could do with the remaining time. Also, he preferred to be with Helen alone when he confronted her. That was one of the good things about loops: he could do anything, no matter how crazy, and there wouldn‚Äôt be consequences.

People continued arriving in droves. Younger students got dropped off by parents, even if they preferred to walk the last hundred feet alone to not be the target of ridicule. Will had done the same in his last year of middle school. Of course, he was luckier than most‚Äîhe had an older brother who had returned from college. Being dropped off by an older, cooler, brother wasn‚Äôt a cause of shame, but a source of positive school cred.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget to buy lunch,‚Äù a mother shouted, to the horror of her son. The unfortunate boy looked down, as if avoiding eye contact with the world could act as a protective shield.

*I feel you,* Will thought.

That one yell from the parent had broken two of the coolness rules in one go: be seen being dropped off by a parent, and flaunt your money. All that was missing was for him to go get a ‚Äúboujie muffin‚Äù that Alex was talking about for breakfast.

¬†

**Restarting eternity.**

¬†

Will broke out in a sprint.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the hurry, weirdo?‚Äù the pair of girls shouted behind him.

*Corridor, mirrors, classroom,* the boy said to himself. He was starting to see the difference of speed between his normal state and after finding the rogue. It was far more than double‚Äîmore like quadruple, at least. And best of all, Will didn‚Äôt feel tired from the sprint one bit.

Helen was the only one in the room, just as he knew she would be. This was perfect.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said, casually making his way to Daniel‚Äôs desk.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù the girl replied. ‚ÄúHelp me open the windows.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù Will tossed his backpack on his new desk. ‚ÄúNo idea why they use industrial solvent to clean,‚Äù he cracked a joke.

‚ÄúSomeone has to.‚Äù

This loop, Helen didn‚Äôt seem particularly impressed. In fact, she was outright distant. Will choosing to change desks had clearly affected her in some way.

‚ÄúWhat do you think happened to Danny?‚Äù Will asked as he opened the window at the back of the room. ‚ÄúAlex heard that he was into some pharma drug test group.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlex doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about.‚Äù The reaction was reserved.

‚ÄúSo, what do you think happened?‚Äù

Choosing not to answer, the girl went to the next window and started opening it. Will did the same. They were only a few steps away from one another. In his mind, the boy considered how to continue the conversation. The fact that there was no right or wrong approach only made him more hesitant. Despite all logic, and for no reason, he wanted to nail it on his first go, as if that was going to grant him some sort of life achievement.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he began. ‚ÄúI saw you at the nurse‚Äôs office. Everything ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy should I go there?‚Äù She avoided his glance, opening the window, far slower than she was supposed to.

That had to be it‚Äîthe proof that Will was searching for. Miss Perfect wasn‚Äôt the type of person to look away, not for someone like him. She had to know what he was hinting about.

‚ÄúTo look in the mir‚Äî‚Äù

Without warning, Helen twisted around like a martial artist in a video game. The action was so fast and surprising that anyone would have received a kick in the waist. Thanks to the rogue, Will wasn‚Äôt anyone. His body moved on its own, pulling back to avoid the attack.

Helen‚Äôs foot past swooshed less than an inch from him, landing on the window frame.

¬†

**KNIGHT‚Äôs BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Frame shattered.**

¬†

A message appeared in the air.

‚ÄúKnight?‚Äù Will thought. This was the first time Will saw messages triggered by someone other than himself. The good news was that he had been right, and she was another time looped. The bad news‚Äîshe had started their conversation in a very violent fashion.

Not giving him a moment to catch his breath, the girl grabbed the nearest desk and threw it at him, as if it were a toy.

*Holy shit!* Will rolled on the ground, avoiding the hit again by inches.

A second desk flew towards the classroom door, blocking any means of escape. It also prevented others from coming in. Helen was either very good at strategic thinking, or she had planned this in advance‚Ä¶ just like him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre time looped!‚Äù Will jumped onto Daniel‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

For three full seconds, the girl didn‚Äôt respond. His hunch was correct‚Äîshe wouldn‚Äôt risk damaging it.

‚ÄúJust like Daniel.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk to me about Daniel, murderer!‚Äù Anger flashed through her eyes. Whatever kept her from going all out was gone. The girl grabbed several chairs and threw them at him in immediate succession.

Reacting on instinct, Will evaded one while kicking the other in what he perceived to be his weak spot. The chair shattered in two, but so did the boy‚Äôs leg.

*You gotta be kidding!* A wave of pain shot up from his leg, making him puke on the spot. There was no way this was an accident‚ÄîWill had become a lot more fragile. Any moderate hit was able, if not to break his bones, at least cause enough pain for it to seem it had.

The boy fell to the floor, knocking down the desk he had been standing on. More waves of pain based through him, partially numbed down by the first.

Before he was in a state to act, Helen had made her way above him, pinning him down with the back of a chair.

‚ÄúWhy did you kill him?‚Äù she asked, pressing the chair into his chest with such strength that he could barely breathe.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù Will wanted to say that he didn‚Äôt, that he had no idea what she was talking about. The agony he was in prevented him from uttering anything remotely intelligible.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forgive you.‚Äù

Suddenly all pain subsided, as the girl pushed onto the chair, snapping Will in two.

¬†

**Restarting eternity.**

¬†

Will gasped for air as he stood in front of the school. Not only the pair of girls, but everyone in the area looked at him as if he‚Äôd come to school naked.

This was the first time a loop had been triggered by his death, and he definitely didn‚Äôt like it. The crippling pain was gone, replaced by crippling mental anxiety. Was he the same person now that he‚Äôd died once? Or had the loop created a clone with his memories?

‚ÄúHey, dude, need a doctor?‚Äù someone asked.

Will didn‚Äôt have the capacity to tell whether that was a genuine offer for help or a sarcastic comment. All he knew was that he had to get away from here.

Going against the flow of the crowd, he ran out of the school gates in the first direction he could see. It didn‚Äôt matter where he went as long as Helen wasn‚Äôt there. Soon enough, he found himself in front of a coffee shop. Looking around twice, to make sure he was safe, Will then went inside.

The place was small and mostly empty. A fragrant smell of coffee, cocoa, and sugar filled the space, giving it a homey feeling of coziness.

Spotting an empty table in the car corner, Will rushed to it and sat down. His hands were still trembling. It was only now that his mind started to go past the fact that he had died, focusing on other, almost as serious, issues. Key among them was the realization that Helen was also looped. As such, she would remember what happened in previous loops, not to mention there was every chance that she would react just as aggressively each time they came across each other. The only way to avoid that was to avoid her altogether, which meant not entering the classroom.

Second, Will really had to find a solution to his fragile state. That meant that activating the rogue mirror was no longer a matter of choice. The fast reflexes were the only thing that gave him a chance. Had Daniel gone through the same? Likely. Why was Helen so convinced Will had murdered him, though?

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù The barista placed a mug of cocoa at the boy‚Äôs table.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt order that,‚Äù the boy said, confused.

‚ÄúYour hands did.‚Äù

Will looked down at his hands. They were still trembling.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù The barista said. Tall, skinny, with orange hair, he seemed somewhere between his late twenties to early thirties, emanating an air of chill that would make even Alex envious. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the first time someone has come here to hide. Also,‚Äù he leaned closer. ‚ÄúSince cocoa is brewed by the jug, there‚Äôs no way of keeping track of it,‚Äù he whispered.

The absurdity of the statement made Will quickly forget his recent death experience.

‚ÄúIf you want something with it, though, you‚Äôll have to pay for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you have?‚Äù The boy looked around, actually seeing the coffee shop for the first time.

Barely large enough to hold six tables in total, it gave ‚Äúhome cooking‚Äù vibes. Dark wooden paneling covered the lower half of the walls, complemented by the beige wallpaper. Paintings of cakes, doughnuts, and coffee were all over the place, providing a hint of what could be found at the glass counter. On closer inspection, one would see plates of sandwiches‚Äîmade with homemade bread, as was chalked down on the board behind. A large wooden board with the phrase ‚ÄúNo TV! No Wi-Fi! Just talk to each other‚Äù hung near the window onlooking the street.

‚ÄúDo you have muffins?‚Äù Will asked, the phrase engraved into his mind after so many loops.

‚ÄúMuffins?‚Äù The barista laughed. ‚ÄúThat would be the day. Ever since Spencer got those things, everyone‚Äôs been asking.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Spencer?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe owner of the place near your school. You are from Enigma High?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Well, what do you suggest?‚Äù

‚ÄúMousse.‚Äù The answer came without hesitation. ‚ÄúMost of our older customers avoid it, but I‚Äôm sure you can handle a bit of sweetness. Fifteen bucks, but it‚Äôs worth it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù Money didn‚Äôt matter. By the time it came to pay, a new loop would have started. Besides, Will was slightly curious. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have that.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Be right back.‚Äù

As the barista went to get a cup of mousse, Will took a sip of his cocoa. The taste was nice, although it could have used a bit more sugar.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs chasing you?‚Äù The barista asked. ‚ÄúIf you want to share.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want to know a secret?‚Äù The orange-haired said, looking over his shoulder. ‚ÄúWhen someone says that, it never is. The reasons are always simple. It‚Äôs the solutions that are often tricky, but even then, not as much as most people think.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a classmate that can beat me up anytime,‚Äù the boy said. As long as advice was offered, he might as well take advantage.

‚ÄúJust like that?‚Äù The barista returned, placing the cup of moose on the table along with a laughably small spoon. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem like the type to get easily beaten up.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt seen the other guy.‚Äù Or girl, as the case was.

‚ÄúI know this might sound cringe, but have you tried talking? I don‚Äôt mean bonding and all that. Everyone has some sort of motivation. As long as you find out what it is, you could convince your classmate that beating you up won‚Äôt help him fulfill it. And if that doesn‚Äôt work, you can always redirect their focus on another target.‚Äù

Will stared.

‚ÄúPsychology graduate.‚Äù The other smiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs helped me a lot in real life.‚Äù

Will laughed as well. Come to think of it, that wasn‚Äôt a bad idea. Helen was set to kill him because she believed him to be responsible for Daniel‚Äôs death. If he managed to convince her otherwise, maybe there wouldn‚Äôt be any more prematurely ended loops.

The boy scooped a spoonful of chocolate mousse and put it in his mouth. It really was sweet.

I have a Bachelor's in Exercise Science and a Master's degree in Nutrition. I have worked as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) since 2019. To be honest, I pursued this career path because I was \*passionate about nutrition\* in undergrad (aka: had an eating disorder). I'm doing OK now, but after 5 years of practicing as a RDN, I have come to understand that working in nutrition is holding me back from a full recovery

I am good at my job, and I have achieved some success in the field (although a high-level job in this field pays less than 60k...lol). However, I no longer want to think about nutrition as part of my day-to-day life. Here are a few things I have learned since becoming a RDN:

* Conducting individual nutrition consultations makes me feel emotionally exhausted. I end up dreading  each day. I love talking to people, but I no longer want to assess diets or provide nutrition advice.
* I find myself daydreaming of a simpler job, where I can interact with others, but with less pressure.
* I prefer an active job; 8 hours behind a desk exhausts me. I have enjoyed patient care jobs where I get to walk around a large hospital between patients. 
* I like to have some sense of purpose, even if it's just providing a pleasant interaction to brighten someone's day

I have applied for clerical/administrative jobs at my University hospital system, but I am not getting any interviews. I suspect this is because my education and work experience is highly specialized in nutrition. I need to get out of my current job ASAP for my mental health, so I am thinking about coffee shop or retail work while I decide what to do. I have a house payment to keep up with, so I need to be working full-time. I also have very low self-esteem and feel like a failure if I am not working. I feel horrible for wasting time and money pursuing this career, but I am trying not to let it bother me, since feeling guilty is unproductive. 

Outside of working as a RDN, I have worked adjunct professor (just 1 semester teaching a nutrition course), and I have experience managing employees. I also worked in retail, foodservice, and grocery while in college. I liked all of these jobs a decent amount. 

I have thought about teaching, but I don't want to commit to going back to school quite yet. I frankly can't afford it, and I'm terrified of committing to another field that I'll grow to despise in a few years. Does anyone have ideas of jobs I would be qualified for? I am truly at a loss, so I would love some input. 

  
TLDR; don't become a dietitian if you have an eating disorder...you will regret it <3",1,1730310626.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

My fianc√© and i got engaged last winter, things have been good but sometimes better than others. Recently, I‚Äôve tried to talk to him about a number of things. I‚Äôve noticed in arguments he often tries to gaslight me. Prior to this relationship i was in an abusive relationship for 4 years. I know the signs and very much know what‚Äôs happening when i say something or if he says something. He often tries to manipulate situations and tells me that i said something i didn‚Äôt or he never said something. 

We share our location, we live in a pretty major metropolitan city, though i see nothing wrong with this. However this morning something told me to check. So i do.. i see that he‚Äôs at the coffee shop ( he had already left for work at this point..his job is literally around the corner from our apartment) and i called to see if he could grab me a coffee since i had already started working. He doesn‚Äôt answer. I try again. Nothing. I text him. No answer.  So i took a screenshot of him at the coffee shop because i had a feeling he was going to try to tell me he wasn‚Äôt there.  He finally called me back once he was in his office and said that he had been helping with shipping in the basement and that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt answer me. 

I have screenshots of you at the coffee shop i said. He hung up on me. 

I tried to explain to him that i don‚Äôt care if he got coffee, went with someone from work or just didn‚Äôt want to get me coffee i care that im being lied to. 

He went on to tell me he has no idea what im talking about and calling me delusional. 

After his break he said he was going to the post office (with 15m left of his break) which he told me he was going to tomorrow.. and we both went outside to go to separate places. I was still upset trying to talk to him and he was still denying the fact of the SS. He ended up walking back into his job and blocking me ( so i can‚Äôt see his location ) so i have no idea if he ended up going‚Ä¶but i just don‚Äôt understand why you would care if i saw that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre going if that‚Äôs actually where you‚Äôre going? 

The other day i asked to borrow $30, i would pay him back this Friday. Anytime I‚Äôve ever borrowed any money from him I‚Äôve always paid him back immediately. I‚Äôve borrowed money maybe 4 times in 4 years.  He told me he didn‚Äôt have $30 to let me borrow but i know he did because he had sold something for $1,800 earlier that week. 

He‚Äôs not a very affectionate person. Sure, he tells me he loves me. Peck kisses me. Sometimes cuddles and holds my hand but it seems like overall there‚Äôs a missing connection or the best way i can describe this is it feels like I‚Äôm alone in the relationship. We barely have sex and when we do it‚Äôs not great for me. Which I‚Äôve mentioned multiple times to him and have told him i don‚Äôt feel wanted because he never makes any moves. I literally have to ask if we‚Äôre having sex tonight which is not sexy to either of us. In the past whenever I‚Äôve tried to make move on him he‚Äôs always been tired or tells me to move my hand he‚Äôs trying to watch tv. Overall seems not interested, so i stopped. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what to do anymore. I love him and more often than not we get along and things are ok but i just get the feeling he‚Äôs not *in love* with me. 

Am i overreacting to all of this?

I'm John, from the greatest city in the world, Chicago. With a city so big you'd think dating is easy, I wish that was the case. Tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

I'm pretty simple! Go out one weekend night a week with friends to shoot some pool and have a few drinks. I tend to visit coffee shops and check out record stores on weekends too. However, I'm also good at being a coach potato on a weekend if it's needed.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I‚Äôve mentioned in my post, it‚Äôs up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on ‚Äúhey‚Äù or smalltalk responses.

We want, in addition to island seating, cushioned seating which we plan to squeeze under the windows in the form of a bench.

Other important architectural details:
- Top right is a fireplace and we have about 8‚Äô6‚Äù from exterior wall to fireplace leading to dining room.
- Potential cabinet space opposite range is split by a wall since we need a post at this point to bear the load of the beam opening up to the sunroom. 

Our builder doesn‚Äôt recommend putting any plumbing in the old sunroom area since it‚Äôs over crawlspace and we‚Äôre in cold climate zone, MN. Could we run plumbing in toe-kicks? And wife doesn‚Äôt want sink in island, which is fair enough since it‚Äôll only be 36-42‚Äù deep. Therefore, the most obvious place for the sink is bottom right, adjacent to range and above basement, but this starts to obstruct flow to dining room.

Where would the fridge go? Opposite range feels too far away from cooking zone and wall between dining room and hallway openings seems like it‚Äôll cause congestion. What about the far left, in the corner of the old sunroom? Is that weird?

We‚Äôre also big coffee people with multiple appliances that we use daily (Grinder, Moccamaster, Espresso machine) that would ideally be hidden (as it gets messy, esp grinder) but also that we don‚Äôt need to move to use. We also make smoothies everyday so I envision a beverage and coffee station - which could be located opposite range or in sunroom, adjacent to range.

Part 1","I moved into the city for school, growing up and spending my whole life up until this point in a small town surrounded by forests and mountains. I was looking forward to college in a new environment, new people to meet, new things to learn and being lucky enough to have an uncle with a decent sized apartment in the city, that he had as a ‚Äúvacation home‚Äù I not only had a enough money to go to a city college but also a place to stay I had more reason than not to leave home. Sadly after two semesters of general ed I was already bored of the little box built into the wall concrete maze I chose to move into, but the people have been interesting. I joined the ‚ÄúUrban Exploration Society‚Äù, a small club that was only called a society to make it sound more official. The club was all about finding hidden gems around the city mostly abandoned malls and old subway tunnels that were either filled with gray water or a djs and their audiences of clubbers who were too cool for the clubs that were named single un-descriptive words like ‚Äúthe spot‚Äù or ‚Äúhere‚Äù stupid shit like that. But those tunnels were where I found the thing that left me utterly devastated at what it made me do, of what it made me become. I was never one to get caught up in ghost stories, not that there was a shortage of them in a small town surrounded by forest filled with abandoned houses. 

One day while I was walking through the tunnels I had found something new, after going into the subway it was pretty easy getting to the abandoned stations once getting to the maintenance tunnels and it was a path I had taken probably a hundred times before at that point and I had always passed these weirdly gothic looking doors, not in their shape but in what was on them. They were the average maintenance rectangular metal doors but they had crude carvings of vaguely religious scenes I would look at it and admire the detail done by what was probably a ring of keys but this time I noticed the chains and locks that were tightly secured to the handles were now gone, like someone came down just to unlock the chain and take it back up to the overworld and with the curiosity getting the best of me I decided to explore the new path that, as far as I knew, was laid out just for me. 

I walked through the rusted doors and passed the tunnels walls checkered with missing tiles and as I reached the end of the hall I stood in front of an arched doorway. The arched was almost regal in its design, where the entrance was gothic in its depiction; this was so in the design, but more imposing than any other structure built in the way. From there it only became more ornate. I entered an enormous auditorium. It had stone shelves carved into the walls and candle holders protruding from the walls. The architecture was somehow a cross between a Roman temple and a medieval cathedral. The design was so ornate that if you looked at it side by side to Notre Dame it would make the latter look like a gas station. 

I shined my light around the room and was mesmerized by its size, there was no way this could fit down here, I wasn‚Äôt that deep in the tunnels. Leading up to this point I had been walking through a foot or two of water but when i reached the center of the room I stepped up onto the large circular platform that stood at the center of this lake of ruined books and more drowned rats than I'd like to think about as I looked at the platform I noticed a cliche circle of candles lining the edge of the platform with a spooky red painted ritual probably painted in human blood (sarcasm). Despite the human sacrifice probably painted by some other dumbass who likes to explore thr sewer for fun I was in awe of the underground cathedral as I was taking my last looks I stepped on seemingly the only book not soaked by sewer water that sat on the platform I went completely horizontal in the air and fell onto my back. Luckily my backpack broke my fall but it didn't do much for the candle stick the back of my head hit causing both a slight ringing and a small cut. I rolled over and pulled myself back up looking for the book i slipped on, I picked up the the thick bible like book. Examining it, it had an ornately carved metallic cover with buckles holding it shut. 

Since everything else in here was probably developing some new species of mold I decided to take it as a souvenir of this place before it was covered in graffiti and locked back up. Making my way out of the room I trudged back through the water, through the arch, the doors and finally back onto the subway platform as I made my way back to my apartment. Finally getting home I walked into my apartment and threw my bag onto the ground as well as immediately stripping naked, throwing my clothes in the wash and then washing myself. I was eager to read the book so I took it out of my bag and began to read it on the couch. I laid it open on my coffee table and began to flip through the pages trying to find at least one thing I could understand, there was nothing, but there were plenty of pictures depicting everything from someone being shackled to a stone podium as a hairless dog crawls out of their mouth to a woman on top of a decomposing corpse. Continuing to flip through the book I pulled out my phone to see if there was any more information or translations at least I could find on the internet. 

I don‚Äôt know if it was the shower or maybe I scratched it or I stretched the skin but the cut opened back up and as I hung my head over the book I felt blood run from my hairline to my cheek and before I could wipe it away a drop fell on to a page of text and instantly I felt like I was hit by a truck from behind as I fell onto the floor flying over the coffee table. I stood to my feet somehow not feeling any lingering pain and as I looked back at where I was sitting I saw my body floating a few feet above the ground, it was tense and stiff spasms moved through the body every few seconds, I looked around in shock and my eyes were caught by my reflection in the window as I saw a disembodied nervous system looking back at me.

As I tried to scream I watched as the web like tendrils maintain the shape of how it would be in my hand. As I tried to stand every surface I touched felt like a numb fuz running through my spectral body, I could only kneel with my palms in the floor to ease my weight rather than letting it all rest on my feet, I heard the sound of shifting stone as the red brick wall began to shift and morph into an arched doorway. I watched as a pale woman draped in white linen and long jet black hair hanging over her face. She walked towards me as I felt the shape of my body held by my nerves slowly unraveled into loose tendrils until she spoke, 

‚ÄúLittle one, you are forgiven for you know not what you do‚Ä¶‚Äù

She reached out and placed her hand over what should've been my chest as I watched as my body unnaturally moved towards me. She moved her hand away and just as she did my body grabbed me and began to shove the nerves into its mouth and consume me without chewing, finally rejoining my body as I felt myself swallowing. I was once again kneeling in front of the woman in white only now in my earthly body.

‚Äú... you knocked on a door not knowing who would answer, fortunately for you I answered, and I bring a gift‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her voice echoed in my head as she leaned into me, as I closed my eyes I felt a kiss but once I opened my eyes I was once again sitting in front of the open book my blood now stained on the page only now as I looked at the page I now understood every word.

I was consumed by the book, all other aspects of my life faded away. The book was full of knowledge that had been lost. Who knows how long ago, I learned that the ritual I found in the sewers was crude and done poorly compared to what it was supposed to be. So since I was eager to put this into practice I decided to follow through with this mistake. I hadn't been on campus in weeks but I broke this streak one night as I slipped into the medical building, I took the elevator into the basement where I found a body. The room was cold and medicinal, everything was either tile or metal and at the center of the room is an autopsy table where a body lies wrapped in a body bag. I zipped it closed and tried to throw it over my shoulder but it is a lot heavier than I expected. I carried it outside and after a 5hr walk to get down 2 blocks barely avoiding any whitnessess. I dropped the bag onto the floor, similarly closing the door as I caught my breath. I open the bag and lifted the body out of the bag and dropped it into the wax circle at the center of my living room. 

As the body lays at the center I hold up my hands as I kneel at the rim of the circle and begin to speak the words of the book and with each word a candle would light and the body began to move and lay sped across the sigils painted onto my floor. I watched as the body began to float above the glowing sigils and familiar astral tendons rise from the floor and connect to the body, at the same time I feel pins and needles at the center of my palm, after it spasms and shakes for a second it falls back onto the floor. It rises to its feet and begins to cough and let out muffled yells like it can't bring itself to make any real noise. I look down at my palms and see black veins originating from their centers, I look up at the animated creature scratching at its throat and once I see it notice me it charges and starts trying to speak barely making out the words. I kick it off of me as it runs to my door, I hold up my hand and shout,

‚ÄúYou will not leave!‚Äù

As the words leave my mouth the ghastly nervous system is torn violently from the body and is absorbed into my arm, the veins now cover my hand and fade into my forearm. I look at the body as it remains standing only a few inches in front of the closed door, unmoving. I scramble towards the book as I hold my hand up preventing it from touching anything. I search through looking for something to make the body move. I found a new spell, I used a kitchen knife to cut my hand and reach into the cursed infection and pulled out an astral form from my palm and threw it into the ground. It crawls over to the statue of meat and bone leaving a viscous liquid in its path behind it and it climbs into the body through the back of its head. I feel fear as there is no reaction. Until it turns around.

He had no underlying heart diseases apart from high blood, which he used to take a pill every way pressure. We had a history in our family that everyone lives beyond 85, but this changed everything for me. I feel angry at everything, especially god, as I did not see whether he was in bad health or required my immediate attention. I was only three hours away from my family home, so I could have travelled anytime if he told me if there was something wrong with him. This has changed my life forever, as I did not expect this to happen even in my wildest dreams. 

The most considerable guilt I carry is not being able to give happiness to my father when he needed it the most and being rude to him sometimes - not intentionally. I still loved him regardless and could have done anything to save him. I am also somewhat angry at him as he prioritises his workload over his health, and sometimes, I wonder if that took a toll on his heart. He was running around like a 50-year-old with a 70-year-old heart. I always thought I would have time with him, but that was an illusion, as life is unfair and unpredictable. I heard the sudden death stories but never thought it would happen to me. I operate like a robot nowadays and don't know what I am doing.

At times, I'm his new much younger officemate. Other days, I'm his wife. Yesterday, I was his mother. I like that mistaken identity a little more than the others; I get to nag him, and he listens with the deference of a sweet mama's boy. But on the days that hurt, I'm just a stranger who has overstayed her visit. I lie beside him in his room and point to my face: ""Dad, I'm your daughter. I have your nose. Aren't these your eyes?"" But it isn't up for discussion. ""Come back tomorrow at 11 a.m. with the papers,"" he'd say, promptly shutting the door. 

My happiest days are like today when I went out to buy coffee with Dad. My dad, Mr. Congeniality as always, had to say hi to every person he encountered while out and about.

Literally on my street, 1/4 mile (400 m) away. I've driven past this I don't know how many hundreds of times and never noticed. I need more coffee in my life...

60-70 year old Sargent Juniper, 40"" tall (1 m) (guesstimate)

I think the property owners had a couple burning bushes planted really close that shaded out the right side. I believe they had those removed recently. They also have recently planted a few new trees at the front of the property. My concern is that they are going to rip this guy out with a tractor and put it in the burn pile.

I want to reach out to these people (mail a letter) and see if I can dig it out for free. I was wondering if anyone has had any luck with this approach? How do I broach the issue without sounding crazy? Should I tell them I do bonsai, or are they going to want to ask for money then?

Also, I would appreciate any guidance as far as extraction goes. I know this has been discussed before; are there any key bookmarks out there?

I'm assuming dig early spring after the ground thaws. Around here, that is typically March/April, but it also means thick, heavy MUD. If I can get a 24"" (61 cm) root ball I would be happy. Put in wood grow box with pumice. Then take out a second mortgage for the ceramic.

I've dug out similar sized yews that are still alive, but I know juniper are a bit different.

Around my area, this is probably once in a lifetime material. I don't want to f\*ck it up.

1gfriqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gfriqo/insights_on_evaluating_a_job_offer_accept_this/,"Insights on evaluating a job offer - accept this one, or keep looking?","Hi Reddit, 

My workplace recently announced that we'll be moving from Hybrid 3x a week in office to 4x a week in office starting in March 2025. I *hate* my commute (it's in an area of the city notorious for having shitty transit, driving *and* cycling options - a true wasteland even though it's spitting distance from downtown). So, I startedlooking around for other roles - but I do have a few months still so I don't *need* to accept the first job offer that comes along. There's also the chance that my office walks back the 4x a week in-office thing because people are really mad about it. 

But I'd hate to turn this down, not find anything better, and be stuck commuting 4x a week come March 1. 

Most of my career experience has been with nonprofit organizations, and I made the jump to a corporation in 2023. This new job offer is with another nonprofit so in a sense it feels a little bit like a step backward/retreat - but I think that's mostly in my head? It's for a Senior Manager role (currently in a Manager role) which is a step forward, technically speaking. I also really resonate with the mission of the nonprofit and personally know a handful of people that have benefited from them, who all speak glowingly of the organization.

There's not a lot of people in my life I'm comfortable talking about career stuff with once talking about compensation is in the picture (I do have mentors, peers, etc. - I'm just not comfy talking about money with people) so it's hard for me to get their feedback on the 'bigger picture' - I'm hoping y'all can help!!

**Current Job**

*Compensation*

* $88k base salary 
* 5% RRSP match
* annual bonus of ""up to 10%"" (last year, it was 7% - depends on both my performance and the company's performance, getting the full 10% is pretty unheard of afaik) 
* $1,500 in stock annually (stock is doing pretty well of late and is beating the TSX Composite benchmark by over 30% in 2024)
* $500 ""Wellness Stipend""
* $500 HSA 

*QOL/Other Factors* 

* 3 Weeks Vacation, 3 personal days, plus closed the week between Xmas and New Years. Won't get 4 weeks until 2027.
* Hybrid - in office x3 a week currently... but starting in March 2025, we will have to be in x4 a week.
* Commute is 35-55min when I drive, sometimes more - going with the flow of rush hour
* I usually bike to work but sometimes drive (drive maybe 33% of the time)
* Office is on the edge of downtown in a ""cool"" area - lots of options nearby for lunch, Happy Hour, etc.
* We used to get free breakfast every day, now it's just free breakfast once a week
* We used to get free lunch once a week, now it's just once a month
* I've been here just over a year and haven't really made any friends yet, pretty transient workplace
* I'm a one-person department which means I get a lot of autonomy but limited opportunities for growth, hate that everything (especially admin stuff) falls on me to do
* Even though the company is doing well, it seems like they do a lot of layoffs - there's been a few waves of them already in the ~15 months I've been here. I think my position would be vulnerable to a layoff, but maybe I'm paranoid.

**Job Offer** 

*Compensation*

* Salary offer is for $102k - the salary range on the posting is for $100-110k, I might try to negotiate up to $105k
* 5% RRSP Match
* $500 HSA
* No stock/bonuses (it's a nonprofit organization)

*QOL/Other Factors*

* 4 Weeks Vacation, 2 personal days, plus closed the week between Xmas and New Years.
* ""Summer Hours"" - office closes at 1pm on Fridays between Victoria Day and Labour Day 
* In office 2x a week - unlikely that this would change, this policy predates COVID
* Office is in the Suburbs, literally in the middle of a Forest - limited/no lunch, Happy Hour, coffee, etc. options
* Commute would be a 45min-1hr drive, cycling not an option (but, it is against rush hour traffic flow)
* Free gym in-office (could maybe cancel my gym membership - and work out after work and wait out rush hour?)
* Free lunch once a month
* Seems like a workplace people stick around at - my predecessor was in the role for 6yrs, and the person that would be my boss has been with them for over 10 years.
* Senior Manager role, managing a small team, maybe less autonomy but also less lonely/less having to do everything by myself?
* Would be a revenue-generating role for the nonprofit; usually a pretty safe position even if the rest of the org were to experiencing layoffs (that said, I've found no evidence of any layoffs ever happening there)",1,1730307790.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

This post is borderline a combination of asking for other experiences and me just talking about my issues, lol.

So before anybody comes for me for being an anti-vaxxer, I'm not, this is just what lead me here to this discovery. I got the COVID vaccine in 2021 (I was 21 at the time) and was hospitalized because of having Non Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia and Supra-Venticular Tachycardia. There, I met a cardiologist who was some sort of pioneer of dysautonomia, I don't know. Either way, he said I have dysautonomia and that's why I reacted the way I did. He said I've had it since birth and is not something developed from the vaccine.

I told him I've always had heart palpitations (PVCs), my heart has always raced, I have weird reactions to things where my heart speeds up or beats weird after certain foods, etc. 

**Some things that are bad for me**

1) Eggs really do it for me. Anytime I eat eggs, my heart slows down and feels like it's going to stop. It's very weird and scary

2) Anytime I eat seed oils my heart feels weird. 

3) Heavy sugary or carb diet makes me feel weird as well. 

(When I say weird, it's not like I'm going to die. I can carry on with whatever I'm doing but I def feel slightly uncomfortable in my chest)

4) Nicotine is a no go for me. It was ""cool"" to dip in HS during Football. Back then, I didn't think much of my heart racing but I recently had a stint with Zyns and had nothing but chest pain, racing heart, etc 

5) I do okay with caffeine from coffee (I drink a lot) but any energy drink, especially Red bull, makes my heart go crazy

6) I have never nor will ever drink or do drugs but the seldom times I've smoked weed years ago, the same thing happened as Nicotine

7) Sexual activity sets my heart into overdrive. My heart races soooo much and have tons of PVCs

9) Eating high amounts of Omega 6 foods like Nuts, my heart feels a little faster than normal

Some things that have helped me

1) Eating a diet of real food. I basically just eat meat, fruit, veggies. I abstained from Red Meat for years but now days where I just eat Beef and Fruit/Veg, I feel my best

2) LMNT salt packs have been life changing - I don't feel any heart palpitations if I drink 1 a day. Every morning I drink that in 1L of water, and a cold brew coffee, and feel great

3) Getting outside and walking 10k-30k steps a day. At first, my heart didn't like this but now I feel my best

Last thing I'll say is I've found that in adrenaline situations, I DUMP adrenaline into my system at an inappropriate level. I can feel it. It's kind of freaky because it feels like I could run through a brick wall

Hi everyone,

I would love to get some outside opinion on a fight I‚Äôm (30s F) having with my partner (30s M).

For context, I‚Äôm in a relationship with my partner for about two years. Before that, I was in a seven year relationship with a guy who emotionally cheated on me for the majority of our time together. 
Right before I got together with my current partner I had moved from a big city to a smaller one and my partner knows that I didn‚Äôt have the easiest time adjusting to the environment here. My professional network here is very small on confined to the people I meet at my job‚Äîhaving a network is important for me and the type of work I do. 

Onto the issue. Today I stumbled upon a local article that talked about a person in my industry and I recognized her name from a time when I used to live in the larger city. She does the same type of work I do, but we never met personally, but I know _of_ her as we both used to live in the larger city for a while. So we kinda knew the same people, I remember her name but idk if she knows mine, that type of thing. I remember her distinctly because my ex, the guy I was with for a long time, was ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with her. At least that‚Äôs what he told me. I found out later that he had secretly met with her, went to dinner with her, was ultra sweet and cute to her. In short, he had a crush on her and was trying to land with her, despite being in a relationship with me at that time. She, however wanted to be friends and always turned him down (I know because I read his texts, arrest me). Eventually, their ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù faded and my ex moved onto the next person to (try to) cheat with.

Anyhow, I realized that none of this was really her fault and that she is her own person regardless of what my ex thought of her, and so I decided to reach out. My motive was, we‚Äôre in the same small city, have both spent significant years of our career in the larger one, and we do the same type of work. Why not meet up for a coffee. I briefly chatted to my good friend, asking their opinion if that‚Äôs weird given the history with my ex, but even my friend assured me that after all it wasn‚Äôt mine or the woman‚Äôs baggage but my ex‚Äôs. 

Later in the day, I told my partner. And I know that he is very sensitive every time I mention my ex so I gave him the caveat of that this might be a sensitive thing before I told him exactly what I wrote up here. And he got so upset! He said it‚Äôs weird, and he said that I‚Äôm constantly trying to find ways to keep my ex in my life. And then later he said it‚Äôs weird that I asked my friend first before I consulted him. He also says that I asked my friend for permission, which is not true. I just wanted an opinion. My partner says that now he can‚Äôt say he doesn‚Äôt want me to message her because I already did and that I ‚Äúalways do whatever I want no matter how he feels‚Äù. He says his opinion doesn‚Äôt matter to me and I would‚Äôve ignored it anyways. He is of the opinion that if a person is uncomfortable with their partner meeting someone/hanging out with someone/speaking to someone etc. and they say that, that the respectful thing of the partner is to follow that request and not meet up/hang out/talk. He says if I requested this from him then he would not do it out of respect for me and for not wanting to hurt me. We clearly have a difference in opinion here because I don‚Äôt even think there‚Äôs anything weird going on. My ex isn‚Äôt even in the country anymore and this woman clearly didn‚Äôt want anything from him. And even if, what does it have to do with my partner. Ahhhh.

I‚Äôd love to get your opinion on if this behavior is normal and how I can navigate this situation in the future with my partner? 

This is not the first time a situation like this has happened and I truly struggle with putting myself in his shoes and follow his logic of thinking. I need to know from internet strangers where they think I‚Äôm standing in this and if I need to rethink how I approach situations like this. Any advice is welcome.

Need advice,"My niece had been staying with me for a while since nasa abroad mom (cousin ko) nya. Technically, I'm her legal guardian. Her mom and I grew up together sa 1st and 2nd gen ng kpop and super exposed doon ang niece ko lol kaya imagine our excitement when she's fan girling over kpop/ppop groups and right now super fan ng BINI. She's overall a great kid, sobrang magalang and emphatic. Di rin sya nahihiya mag open up samin ng mom nya. Sya yung pamangkin na di nahihiya mag volunteer sa reunion/school events na sumayaw sa harap


The problem:
Last month, nag request sya sa mom nya if pwedeng wag na sya magbaon ng food sa school and money nalang. Okay, sige. Hindi na rin sya kumakain ng rice pero kinakain nya naman yung ulam. I told her mom about this and we're like okay basta kumakain. Then, last week, she only wants to eat skyflakes and boiled egg. Ang sabi pa ng helper namin, nahuli nya raw sa cr na pilit sinusuka yung food nya. Doon ko na sya kinausap like masama ba pakiramdam nya or may problema ba, ba't ang hina nya kumain, etc. Then, she told me gusto nya raw yung body nya maging katulad sa BINI. Pag sinasayaw nya raw yung songs ng BINI while looking at herself sa mirror, ang taba nya raw tingnan, nandidiri daw sya sa self nya at hindi sya good enough. Mind you this is a healthy kid, typical teenager and di naman sya overweight kaya I was so confused. 


What I've tried so far:
I explained to her na BINI has a visual that needs to be taken care of. May healthy diet sila para makagalaw ng maayos and regular exercise. Sinabi ko rin to sa cousin ko and nag iyakan kami sa call. We didn't expect this talaga. Kinausap nya na rin at di napag decide na wag pagalitan kasi baka lalong lumala kaya pinagsasabihan lang namin. So far, sinasabayan ko na syang kumain. I WFH kaya habang kumakain sya, kumakain + nag wowork din ako. I personally meal prep her baon sa school and tinitingnan ko rin kung naubos ang baon. I am actually considering na ipa-therapy sya. I asked my cousin about this and she said pag iisipan pa nya


What advice I need:
Akala ko naman inaabsorb nya yung sinasabi namin magpinsan. But I accidentally opened her shopee (akala ko kasi akin), nakita ko bumili sya ng slimming coffee?? And nagsabi na naman yung helper namin na sumusuka nga na naman.


Pls help naman. Any advice is welcome ü•≤

Some major negatives is that it uses proprietary capsules, takes 15min on initial startup to cool the coffee (I guess if you use it once a day it won‚Äôt need the 15min start up time, but less frequent use will require it). And most importantly it‚Äôs $700. No idea how much the capsules cost either.

English is not my first language, so please don‚Äôt be too harsh on my grammar.

My MIL (F64) has not really had any form of a stable job for about the last 6 years. Even the jobs she had before that, didn‚Äôt really earn well and she was fired from some of them. She was a very good mother to my husband when he was younger, but about the same time she stopped working she started believing in some weird conspiracy theories. These theories gradually became crazier. Lately she has been trying to convince us lizard people walk among us. It also feels impossible to have any sort of normal conversation with her without her sneaking in ‚Äúbut just wait until they finally make med beds accessible to the public‚Äù or ‚Äúthe queen was replaced with a man years ago‚Äù, etc (you get the idea). There is no way to talk to her about this. My husband and his sister have tried many times to set boundaries and tell her they do not want to engage in conspiracy theory discussions, otherwise they will cut contact. She just continues and later plays the victim, saying her kids don‚Äôt care about her.

MIL and FIL got a divorce when my husband was 3 years old (due to in infidelity on FIL side). FIL still provided finances for MIL, even when my husband and his sister were out of the house and earning their own money. The past couple of years FIL has been providing her funds for housing and food. 

She also decided to foster two sisters (10 and 12 years old) about 2 years ago. She lives in an area with poverty, and prior to fostering the kids she used to teach them basic maths, reading and writing (their grades drastically improved). The girls‚Äô parents are drug addicts and their grandma was raising them. About two years ago the grandma died and at the funeral the girls ran to sit with MIL. At that point she decided to foster them. FIL, my husband and his sister told MIL not to do this. Mainly because MIL doesn‚Äôt earn any of her own money and FIL was struggling financially.

About a year ago FIL‚Äôs health started to take a turn. At about the beginning of this year he was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer. We knew MIL would become our financial burden, but my thinking was that any money FIL leaves for my husband can go towards caring for MIL. After FIL died we realised he didn‚Äôt really leave any money and he was in more dept than we thought (story for another day and I don‚Äôt want to go into detail, his death is still raw and a sensitive issue).

MIL is very stubborn and not open AT ALL to anyone telling her what to do or what topics are appropriate to discuss. So we (husband, SIL, her husband and me) decided the best path forward is to see if she can manage the situation and to only intervene once she asks for help/finances. We will then provide funding for a month or two as well as paying for an online TEFL course (teaching kids English) seeing as she was so good at teaching the kids in her community.

She has not yet approached us for help. She is convinced that she is very soon going to come into a lot of money (she has been convinced of this for 2 years) and there is no telling her otherwise. 

People in her area have been reaching out to SIL saying that it is not going well with MIL. She was apparently in court yesterday because she has not been paying rent. SIL also contacted the social worker of the two foster girls (again a story for another day, but basically one of the girls was visiting her biological parents and her father was stabbed in the head during the visit).

At this point, I feel like MIL should actually be institutionalised (should have been a while ago) or at least tested. My husband is sceptical because he doesn‚Äôt want her to resent us for basically saying we think she‚Äôs crazy and maybe completely destroy their relationship. We also won‚Äôt really be able to pay for the medical costs and lastly we are concerned on the affect this would have on the girls. She constantly tells the girls about all her crazy conspiracies and the two of them often argue with her, but the alternative seems bleaker. At least MIL gets them to school in time, feeds them good food (while neglecting her own nutrition) and keeps them save. This might not be the case in an orphanage and definitely not at the parents house. I agree with my husband‚Äôs concerns. He and SIL think that if she starts eating better this might make a huge difference (she often only consumes coffee and no food in a day). She has apparently been doing that since my husband was little. So maybe providing her with a ‚Äúfood crate‚Äù each week would make a difference. I feel like if she hasn‚Äôt been making proper nutritional choices, why would she start now?

I‚Äôm sorry for being all over the place, but this story is so messy and has a lot of back story. So I‚Äôm struggling to organise my thoughts. But basically we just need advice in general. My husband and I (and SIL and her husband) are newly married and we want to start a family in a couple of years. We are trying to save money to buy a house. We budget, cut on luxuries, live in a small apartment to reach our financial goals and not go into dept.

So basically, the advice I need is:

I‚Äôm planning my 15 days solo trip to Costa Rica, mid November and I would like to ask your point of view on my itinerary and wether or not I need to rent an SUV/car. For the context, I‚Äôm a 30yo male, travelling from Europe. I would love meeting people (tourists and Costa Ricans), surf and discover the local culture. I‚Äôm more a fitness/active kind of guy rather than a party animal.

Itinerary :
- Uvita : activities include surfing at Playa Hermosa and a day-trip to the Corcovado park, among others
- Manuel Antonio : visit the park and do an 8km hike
- Arenal : hiking to the volcano
- Rio Celeste : visiting the waterfall


Keep in mind that I‚Äôm still working on my itinerary and might add activities such as cocoa/coffee plantation tour. 


I would like to add Nosara or Samara but it would be a day of driving/transportation to get there from Rio Celeste. 
Also, I‚Äôm going to Nicaragua after so I need to be close to Liberia to take a bus to the border.


Questions : 

Do I need a car? If so, is an SUV mandatory?
What do you think of my itinerary? 


Thanks a lot for your help & insights. This trip has been a dream of mine for the last few years and I want to make sure I make the right choices without throwing money out of the window.",2,1730306345.0,CostaRicaTravel,7,1.0,False

English is not my first language, so please don‚Äôt be too harsh on my grammar.

My MIL (F64) has not really had any form of a stable job for about the last 6 years. Even the jobs she had before that, didn‚Äôt really earn well and she was fired from some of them. She was a very good mother to my husband when he was younger, but about the same time she stopped working she started believing in some weird conspiracy theories. These theories gradually became crazier. Lately she has been trying to convince us lizard people walk among us. It also feels impossible to have any sort of normal conversation with her without her sneaking in ‚Äúbut just wait until they finally make med beds accessible to the public‚Äù or ‚Äúthe queen was replaced with a man years ago‚Äù, etc (you get the idea). There is no way to talk to her about this. My husband and his sister have tried many times to set boundaries and tell her they do not want to engage in conspiracy theory discussions, otherwise they will cut contact. She just continues and later plays the victim, saying her kids don‚Äôt care about her.

MIL and FIL got a divorce when my husband was 3 years old (due to in infidelity on FIL side). FIL still provided finances for MIL, even when my husband and his sister were out of the house and earning their own money. The past couple of years FIL has been providing her funds for housing and food. 

She also decided to foster two sisters (10 and 12 years old) about 2 years ago. She lives in an area with poverty, and prior to fostering the kids she used to teach them basic maths, reading and writing (their grades drastically improved). The girls‚Äô parents are drug addicts and their grandma was raising them. About two years ago the grandma died and at the funeral the girls ran to sit with MIL. At that point she decided to foster them. FIL, my husband and his sister told MIL not to do this. Mainly because MIL doesn‚Äôt earn any of her own money and FIL was struggling financially.

About a year ago FIL‚Äôs health started to take a turn. At about the beginning of this year he was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer. We knew MIL would become our financial burden, but my thinking was that any money FIL leaves for my husband can go towards caring for MIL. After FIL died we realised he didn‚Äôt really leave any money and he was in more dept than we thought (story for another day and I don‚Äôt want to go into detail, his death is still raw and a sensitive issue).

MIL is very stubborn and not open AT ALL to anyone telling her what to do or what topics are appropriate to discuss. So we (husband, SIL, her husband and me) decided the best path forward is to see if she can manage the situation and to only intervene once she asks for help/finances. We will then provide funding for a month or two as well as paying for an online TEFL course (teaching kids English) seeing as she was so good at teaching the kids in her community.

She has not yet approached us for help. She is convinced that she is very soon going to come into a lot of money (she has been convinced of this for 2 years) and there is no telling her otherwise. 

People in her area have been reaching out to SIL saying that it is not going well with MIL. She was apparently in court yesterday because she has not been paying rent. SIL also contacted the social worker of the two foster girls (again a story for another day, but basically one of the girls was visiting her biological parents and her father was stabbed in the head during the visit).

At this point, I feel like MIL should actually be institutionalised (should have been a while ago) or at least tested. My husband is sceptical because he doesn‚Äôt want her to resent us for basically saying we think she‚Äôs crazy and maybe completely destroy their relationship. We also won‚Äôt really be able to pay for the medical costs and lastly we are concerned on the affect this would have on the girls. She constantly tells the girls about all her crazy conspiracies and the two of them often argue with her, but the alternative seems bleaker. At least MIL gets them to school in time, feeds them good food (while neglecting her own nutrition) and keeps them save. This might not be the case in an orphanage and definitely not at the parents house. I agree with my husband‚Äôs concerns. He and SIL think that if she starts eating better this might make a huge difference (she often only consumes coffee and no food in a day). She has apparently been doing that since my husband was little. So maybe providing her with a ‚Äúfood crate‚Äù each week would make a difference. I feel like if she hasn‚Äôt been making proper nutritional choices, why would she start now?

I‚Äôm sorry for being all over the place, but this story is so messy and has a lot of back story. So I‚Äôm struggling to organise my thoughts. But basically we just need advice in general. My husband and I (and SIL and her husband) are newly married and we want to start a family in a couple of years. We are trying to save money to buy a house. We budget, cut on luxuries, live in a small apartment to reach our financial goals and not go into dept.

So basically, the advice I need is:
How do we manage this situation to be the best outcome for the girls, MIL and us? How does financing work in terms of managing a possible mental disorders (logically I know we have to pay, but is there any way to keep it minimal?)?

Looking for a lip pencil that can elevate your makeup game? I recently got my hands on the MAC Lip Pencil in Boldly Bare, and I'm excited to share my thoughts.

This creamy pencil glides on smoothly, making it a breeze to outline and fill in lips. I found the Boldly Bare shade to be a versatile nude that works well with many lipstick colors. It's great for creating a natural-looking lip contour or as a base for your favorite lip products.

https://preview.redd.it/j11yb4327xxd1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6105f2baedc2605cd5f2ce42de52f86302b79e2f

I was impressed by how long-lasting this pencil is. It stayed put through meals and drinks without much fading. The texture is just right - not too soft that it smudges easily, but not so hard that it tugs at your lips.

One thing to note is that the pencil is on the smaller side, which some users might find disappointing. But I think its size makes it easy to carry around for touch-ups.

# Bottom Line

If you want a reliable lip pencil that's easy to use and versatile, the MAC Lip Pencil in Boldly Bare is a solid choice. It's perfect for everyday wear or as part of a more glamorous look.



# Overview of the MAC Lip Pencil Boldly Bare

I recently tried the MAC Lip Pencil in Boldly Bare. This pencil is great for shaping and filling in lips. It glides on smoothly and doesn't drag. The creamy texture makes it easy to apply quickly and precisely. I found the color to be a nice neutral shade that works well with many lipsticks. It's long-lasting and didn't smudge much throughout the day. The pencil is slim and easy to hold. While I liked the natural look it gave my lips, I wished it was a bit more pigmented. It's a solid choice for everyday wear, but may not be bold enough for dramatic looks. The packaging is simple and sturdy. I think it's a good basic lip pencil, but the price is a bit high for what you get.

# Creamy Texture

I was impressed by how smooth this lip pencil felt when I used it. It glided on easily without any tugging or skipping. The creamy formula made it comfortable to wear all day. I found it simple to draw precise lines and fill in my lips evenly. The texture wasn't too soft or too hard - it struck a nice balance that gave me good control. Even after several hours, my lips still felt moisturized. The creamy consistency also helped the color last longer without fading or feathering. Overall, the texture of this lip pencil made application a breeze and kept my lips looking great.

# Long-Lasting Wear

I was pleasantly surprised by how long this lip pencil lasted. After applying it in the morning, I didn't need to touch up until late afternoon. The creamy formula went on smoothly and stayed put through coffee and lunch. It didn't smudge or feather, keeping my lip line crisp all day. I noticed some fading after eating, but the color remained even. For best results, I found it helpful to pair with a matching lipstick. While not completely transfer-proof, it held up well compared to other pencils I've tried. The staying power is a big plus for busy days when frequent reapplication isn't an option.

# Precision Application

I found the MAC Lip Pencil in Boldly Bare to be a breeze to use. The smooth, creamy formula glides on without skipping or dragging. I was able to line my lips quickly and accurately. The pencil's fine tip lets me create crisp, defined edges. It's great for outlining lips before filling them in or for precise all-over application. I like that I can easily control how thick or thin I want the lines to be. The creamy texture blends well if I want a softer look. It goes on evenly and doesn't bunch up or get patchy. This pencil makes it simple to get neat, polished results every time I use it.

# Versatile Color Selection

I found the color selection for this lip pencil to be quite versatile. The shade ""Boldly Bare"" is a neutral tone that works well with many different lip colors and skin tones. It's great for creating a natural-looking lip line or filling in the entire lip as a base. The color is buildable, so I can adjust the intensity based on my mood or outfit. While the range is somewhat limited with just one shade, its versatility makes up for it. I've used it with both nude and bold lipsticks, and it blends seamlessly every time. The creamy texture helps it glide on smoothly without tugging at my lips. For those who prefer a wider range of colors, this might not be the best option.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this MAC Lip Pencil in Boldly Bare for a while now, and I've got some thoughts to share. Let's break down what I like and don't like about it.

# Pros

* The color is a beautiful, natural-looking nude shade
* It glides on smoothly without tugging at my lips
* The pencil tip allows for precise application
* It has good staying power throughout the day
* It's versatile - I can use it alone or with other lip products

# Cons

* The pencil is shorter than I expected
* Some users received products that seemed used
* It's a bit pricey for a lip pencil
* The shade might not suit all skin tones equally well

I found the MAC Lip Pencil to be a solid choice for everyday wear. The smooth formula made it easy to apply, and I liked how it defined my lips without looking too harsh. It lasted through meals and drinks, which was a big plus for me.

On the downside, I was surprised by the pencil's size. It felt smaller than other lip pencils I've used. I also noticed some people got products that didn't seem brand new, which is a bit concerning.

While I enjoy the natural look it gives me, I think the shade might not work for everyone. It's worth trying in person if you can before buying online.

Despite these issues, I think the quality of the product is good. Just keep in mind that you're paying a premium price for the MAC brand name.

# Customer Reviews

I recently tried the MAC Lip Pencil in Boldly Bare and I'm impressed. Many users love its natural look and easy application. The color is subtle yet noticeable, giving lips a bolder appearance without looking overdone. Lots of people say it stays on well, with one person even using it for their wedding day. The shade is versatile and works for many skin tones.

While most reviews are positive, a few users had issues. One person got a pencil smaller than expected, making them wonder if it was used. Another didn't like the shade they received. But these seem to be rare cases.

Overall, the pencil gets high marks for its color, staying power, and natural finish. With a 4.3 star rating from over 100 reviews, it's clear that many users are happy with this lip pencil.

# Safety and Ingredients

I checked out the ingredients in this MAC lip pencil and felt confident about its safety. The smooth, creamy formula glides on easily without any irritation. I didn't notice any strange smells or reactions when I used it. While MAC doesn't share the full ingredient list publicly, their products generally use common cosmetic ingredients. As with any makeup, it's smart to test it on a small skin area first if you have sensitive skin. I liked that it stayed put all day without bleeding or fading, which meant I didn't have to reapply often or worry about ingesting lots of product.

# Conclusion

I've been using this MAC lip pencil for a while now, and it's become a staple in my makeup routine. The Boldly Bare shade is versatile and flattering on many skin tones. It glides on smoothly and stays put for hours. The pencil's size makes it easy to carry around for touch-ups. While some users noted it might be smaller than expected, I found it to be a good value. The natural-looking color enhances lips without being too bold. It's great for everyday wear or as a base for other lip products. If you're looking for a reliable lip pencil with staying power, this MAC option is worth trying.",1,1730305671.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False

Since I have time to spare I'll tell you guys about a trip we took to Basel back in 2018. A friend of ours(mainly my bf) was getting married in Germany. He's a very close friend so skipping the wedding was not a possible answer. We tried to make it into a 10 day vacation, locked all the places we wanted to visit, applied for the Schengen visa, did all that paperwork and research and when it was time to book tickets and apply for leaves, we were both denied. We both applied for a week, I got 3 days and he got 2, all our plans to explore Europe went up in flames. We booked our flights according to our new schedule, departure on Friday and arrive back on Wednesday morning and he'll attend office after a long flight (20's stupidity, don't make this mistake kids).

We both were EXHAUSTED with work at that time, 12-13 hour work day was a normal routine. On our departure evening we were just looking around to see if there are any kids boarding the flight with us. We both just wanted to sleep through the flight, luckily there were no kids around us on the flight. Relaxing flight from Delhi to Zurich(layover), spent an hour roaming in the lounge like a zombie, eating everything that looked tasty and reached Munich.

Wedding was nice, groom's side was literally 30 friends so wedding was one big party on a farm in the outskirts.   While coming back, there was an issue with our connecting flight from Zurich to Delhi. The airlines overbooked the flight and we were asked to move to the flight 34 hours later. We argued with people there but couldn't get on that flight but we got a decent deal...tickets on the next flight and cash for trouble. Around 4-5 PM, we were done with all the shit, chomping down on our burgers and looking for a place to stay the night. In our original plan, we planned a night in Zurich, drive to Basel and a night in Basel. It was supposed to be a slow day of the vacation for us. After all the hassle, my bf was like ""Basel chalien?"" (T - let's go to Basel? ). Within 30 mins, we booked an AirBnB in Basel and took a car on rent. Within an hour we were on the road, driving to Basel. 

It's a short drive, 90 minutes at max but it's beautiful..... serene views, calm roads, play some of your fav songs and it's heavenly. The original plan was to cook pasta the night we were planning to spend in Basel so in the spirit of following our failed itinerary we picked up ingredients on our way to the AirBnb, also got some alcohol and sweets. Our stay was just besides Rhine, it's a river which divides Basel in two parts. 

It was dark by the time we showered and prepared our dinner. It was a cozy night, we sat by the balcony talking/enjoying the view, finished a whole bottle, danced to ""Strangers in the night"" by Frank Sinatra and yk...  
  
We went out for an early morning stroll, had one of the best coffee and sandwich. Oh, the town! It's so picturesque, like straight out of a painting. We just walked around the town for hours that day; saw a couple of Renaissance and contemporary pieces in the art museum there, window shopping....like we'll go to every shop we saw (only bought a pair of socks lol), ate a lot of sweets, somehow sweet talked our way into getting a table at Les Trois Rois. Saw people swimming in the river there, huge culture shock.

We sat at the riverside table, the sunset hues were breathtaking that evening. We joked about moving to Basel, fantasizing our day to day life if we ever moved their. We sat on the street and planned an alternate life their till like 1-2 AM. 

Next morning we drove back to Zurich, flew back to India and life went to the same routine of meetings and work. The following Sunday was a penny drop moment for both of us....we want money to facilitate experiences like Basel for us but in reality it robbed us of it. It changed how we view our jobs, an extra day off made no difference in our professional life but it definitely helped us feel happier in general. Till now I smile thinking about that day in Basel. A week off every 4-5 months was bare minimum on top of regular weekends. 2018-2020(before Covid), I travelled wayyy more than I travelled in my life till then. The greed to have such experiences made me much more financially responsible, money is a limited commodity don't wanna waste it by falling in trap of consumerism. Travelling was my short term goal, always have a trip in mind which made me much more productive at work as well.   
  
I am not saying that one day was sooo great that it made us think it all, though it was pretty awesome but it was more of a trigger which made re-think and improve a lot of parts of our life. 

If you're thinking why I suddenly remember Basel now, it's because we are planning our honeymoon FINALLY after almost a year of marriage and his first suggestion was Basel.

Ano passado comprei esse caf√© especial no Coffee Lab em S√£o Paulo e congelei para tomar em uma ocasi√£o especial. Geralmente eu compro v√°rios pacotes de 1kg de caf√© especial pra tomar durante uns 4-6 meses e congelo em vasilhas de pl√°stico ou na embalagem original. Esse aqui paguei mais caro do que costumo pagar, veio num pacote de 125g (n√£o lembro quanto paguei, acho que uns 40-50 reais mais ou menos) e j√° veio assim embalado a v√°cuo. 

A data de torra √© 30/10/23 e foi congelado dia 13/11/2023. O tempo foi passando e acabei esquecendo desse caf√©. Lembrei dele esse fim de semana e pra minha surpresa ele ainda t√° muito bom. T√° com um aroma incr√≠vel e sabor de caf√© fresco. Tomei e fui transportada de volta pro dia que eu tava tomando esse caf√© sentada l√° no Coffee Lab. 

Talvez ele estivesse melhor uns 6 meses atr√°s? talvez, at√© porque congelar caf√© n√£o significa que o caf√© vai ficar parado no tempo. Mas ainda assim, o caf√© continua muito bom.   
Esse ano andei tomando muito caf√© fermentado ent√£o t√° sendo bom dar uma pausa essa semana tomando esse caf√© lavado, que ali√°s √© algo que n√£o encontro com tanta facilidade assim pra comprar (pelo menos dentro do meu or√ßamento). ",5,1730305280.0,cafebrasil,1,0.86,False

1gfqida,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1gfqida/trip_report_18_days_as_firsttimers_in_japan_tokyo/,"Trip Report: 18 days as first-timers in Japan. Tokyo, Matsumoto, Takayama, Kanazawa, and Kyoto (with trips to Kawaguchiko, Shirakawa-go, Nara, and Osaka)","Hi everyone!

I personally had looked at a ton of trip reports before my first trip to Japan, so hopefully mine can also help someone else out. If anything sounds robotic, please note that I did format this with ChatGPT so that my writing was more fluid and less of a fever dream due to my jet-lag.

Our 18-day trip was from October 8th through October 26th with 2 people . We did meet up with a friend who lives in Tokyo, so some items were booked for 3 people.

Budget wise, we kept most of our hotels between $65-$125 per night. We did splurge on 1 hotel in Takayama for $250 a night.

Itinerary: 5 days Tokyo (including arrival day), 1 day Matsumoto, 2 days Takayama, 2 days Kanazawa, 4 days Kyoto, 4 days Tokyo (including departure day). Our original plan was to do more day trips out of Tokyo (Nikko and Kamakura), but due to poor weather conditions, they had to be cancelled. Otherwise, I would have taken more days away from Tokyo and used them to go to Hiroshima and Miyajima.

**General Tips/Thoughts**

* **Invest in Great Walking Shoes:** We averaged about 13 miles (21 km) of walking per day. I did extensive research on walking shoes and ended up choosing the **Asics Gel-Nimbus 26**. They were an absolute godsend. We also brought another pair of tennis shoes but only used them once or twice.
* **Avoid Unethical Animal Attractions:** Please keep in mind that many animal cafes and attractions are not ethical and mistreat animals. If you plan on doing any animal-related activities, research ahead of time or consider other ways to spend your money.
* **eSIM vs. International Plans:** I used a **30-day, 10GB Ubigi eSIM** that I set up in advance, and it worked perfectly throughout the entire trip. My partner opted for an international travel plan through his phone company, but it didn't work as well as the eSIM. 
* **Suica and Pasmo Cards:** Upon arrival at Haneda Airport, we wanted a physical, rechargeable transportation card. Walking towards the kiosks to get train tickets, you'll see an information desk, where you can purchase your Pasma card (cash only, so pull the money out from a nearby ATM). Pasmo and Suica are essentially identical and can be used the same way. We loaded 10,000 yen onto each of our cards, which lasted almost the entire trip. You can also use your Pasmo/IC card to pay for food at convenience stores and a lot of vending machines.
* Many places were cash-only, so make sure to have enough yen on hand. ATMs are widely available, but it's wise to double-check your cash before dining or visiting attractions with admission fees.
* **Google Maps** was incredibly helpful for trains and buses. We didn't have issues navigating with it at all.
* **Tattoo Policies:** Our hotels did not allow people with tattoos to use their public baths. If you have tattoos, consider purchasing tattoo covers or booking tattoo-friendly hotels and onsens. We bought tattoo covers at Don Quijote while in Japan but wished we bought better quality ones before we arrived.
* **When purchasing tickets or making reservations from a different time zone, double-check that the dates and times align with your intended schedule in Japan.** We encountered an issue where, despite careful checks while in the U.S., our mobile tickets showed a date one day earlier once we were in Japan due to some websites not properly adjusting for time zone differences.
* **Pack light and do laundry on site:** Every single hotel we booked had coin laundry on the premises. I had packed light for an 18-day trip and still wished I had only packed about half since we had access to self-service coin laundry every single day. Not having the additional clothing in our backpacks would have spared us so much more room for additional souvenirs.
* **Booking flexibility:** Consider not booking all your hotels in advance unless necessary. You need to pre-book your first hotel for immigration purposes, but we noticed that hotel prices dropped significantly while we were in Japan. We could have saved a lot of money by booking hotels as we went. However, for remote areas with limited accommodation during tourist-influx seasons, you should book months ahead. Also, book bus tickets to and from rural towns that see lots of tourists a week in advance. If you're sticking to main cities, leaving some hotel bookings flexible can save you money and give you leeway with travel.

**Day 1: Arrival in Tokyo (Akasaka)**

We arrived at **Haneda Airport** at 6:20 PM. After retrieving our luggage, we headed to the transportation kiosks near the metro to get our **Pasmo cards**. We navigated the metro to get to our hotel, **Via Inn Prime Akasaka**. I was worried navigating transportation would be difficult, but we found it extremely easy.

**Day 2: Odaiba, Ginza, and Akihabara**

We had a reservation at **TeamLab Planets** in Odaiba at 9:30 AM, so we enjoyed breakfast at the hotel and took a train, then a bus to the museum. We had a great time; while somewhat crowded, there weren't too many people on a Thursday morning. **Tip:** Wear pants that you can roll above your knees!

Since my body woke up at 2 AM due to jet lag, I had checked online to see if we could grab a reservation for the **Pok√©mon Caf√©**. We'd had no luck for a full month, but a slot opened up, and I was able to grab one for 1:30 PM that day! If you can't get reservations ahead of time, look late at night or early in the morning once you're in Japan to see if someone canceled last-minute.

With time before our Pok√©mon Caf√© reservation, we decided to walk from TeamLab to the caf√© (about an hour's walk). Along the way, we crossed the **Kachidoki Bridge** to the **Tsukiji Hongwan-ji Temple** in Ginza.

We found a coffee shop called **Bongen Coffee** that had a small line. The wait ended up being about 45 minutes since the shop is small and offers a lot of coffee customization, making each order take longer. The coffee was delicious, but we probably wouldn't have waited if we didn't have excess free time.

Once we got our coffee, we walked to a local park to sit and enjoy it. From there, we made our way to the **Pok√©mon Caf√©**. The caf√© was adorable, and the food was decorated amazingly! Although the food was okay and very pricey, the ambiance made it well worth our while. We spent some time in the gift shop area afterward.

I have a couple of small tattoos, so I needed to buy tattoo covers to use the hotel's public bath and other onsens we had planned. We walked through the streets of **Akihabara**, exploring the eclectic anime shops, and made our way to **Don Quijote Akihabara**. I can't get the stupid store jingle out of my head.

Don Quijote ended up being the ONLY place I could find tattoo covers. However, these covers are extremely thin, and you need multiple layers to cover a tattoo completely. They're also very sticky and hard to remove. Next time, I'll buy thicker, reusable tattoo covers before going to Japan. You can also use surgical/medical tape, but I wanted something more inconspicuous.

As the sun was setting, we decided to walk back to our hotel, even though it was about an hour and 20-minute walk. We strolled by **Kanda Myojin Shrine** at sunset, which was absolutely beautiful and completely empty of tourists by the time we arrived. We then stopped at **Hanzomon Gate** near the Imperial Palace, enjoying the view of the water and city lights at night.

**Day 3: Ueno, Asakusa, and the Imperial Palace**

One of our friends lives in Ueno, so we met up with him at a caf√© called **Coffee House Katsura**. We enjoyed a cheap breakfast set of coffee, thick toast with honey, boiled eggs, and salad to start the day.

After parting ways, we walked toward **Ueno Park** and discovered a school food festival we weren't aware of. We sampled various vendor snacks before exploring the huge park and visiting the **Tokyo National Museum**.

From there, we walked down **Ameyoko Shopping Street**. Feeling hungry for ramen, we found a place called **Karashibi Miso Ramen Kinkanbo Kanda Honten**. It was back in the direction we had come from, but it looked so good we hopped on a bus to get there before the dinner rush. We arrived with a handful of people in line before us and waited about 20 minutes. It was so worth the wait‚Äîan amazing and filling bowl of ramen.

To walk off the food, we decided to stroll back to our hotel, exploring different areas of the city. 

**Day 4: Shibuya, Harajuku, and Shinjuku**

We followed a suggested itinerary provided by u/Sipikay **(**found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1bjif5v/comment/kvsuxkw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), which ended up being perfect for us. The only difference was that we did this on a Saturday, so the **Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building** observatory was closed.

Instead, we decided to be among the first people at the gate for the **Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden**. Despite generally avoiding chain restaurants, we wanted to see if there was a difference in taste and quality at **Starbucks** in Japan versus the U.S. As soon as the gates opened, we went straight to Starbucks to grab a window seat overlooking the pond and garden area. **Tip:** If you want a beautiful view while sipping coffee, arrive before the gates open to get a good seat.

While strolling through **Harajuku**, we found a restaurant called **Roast Beef Ohno Harajuku Branch**, which ended up being an amazing meal with Wagyu and roast beef. We got there at 11 AM and waited around 15 minutes, but there was a giant line by the time we finished.

Additionally, there was a music and food festival called **Hero Gate** happening. We stumbled upon it while walking to the **Shibuya Scramble Crossing** after visiting **Meiji Jingu Shrine**. 

**Day 5: Day Trip to Kawaguchiko**

We booked tickets five days in advance for a bus from **Shinjuku Bus Terminal** to **Kawaguchiko Station**, based on the day with the best weather. For three people, there were already limited seating options, so I'd recommend booking even further in advance. We used [SeeMtFuji.com](http://SeeMtFuji.com) to check visibility forecasts.

Due to holiday weekend traffic, the bus took about twice as long as expected both to and from Kawaguchiko. If you're taking the bus during holidays, be aware that this can set you back multiple hours.

We first made our way to the **Chureito Pagoda** and were able to get a fantastic view of **Mt. Fuji**. The climb up to the pagoda is steep but absolutely worth it.

From there, we returned to the train station and decided to check out **Fuji-Q Highland** amusement park since it was such a nice day. We didn't go on any rides due to long wait times because of the holiday weekend but had a blast wandering around the park, sightseeing, and finding food.

We grabbed matcha ice cream from a small shop near one of the train stops before our train arrived. Back in Kawaguchiko, we considered the panoramic ropeway but didn't have enough time before our bus left. Instead, we enjoyed a beautiful trail around **Lake Kawaguchiko**.

We wanted to try the local **hoto noodles**, so we went to **Hotou Fudo Kawaguchiko Station**. Surprisingly, despite being right across from the station, the restaurant was filled with locals. We enjoyed our giant noodle bowls while sitting on tatami mats and drinking beer‚Äîa super memorable meal.

**Day 6: Matsumoto**

We woke up early to get to **Shinjuku Bus Terminal** for our highway bus to **Matsumoto**. The ride was quick, taking about two hours.

Upon arrival, we walked six minutes to our hotel, dropped off our stuff, and wandered around the town. We strolled along **Nawate Shopping Street**, looking at ceramics and frog-themed souvenirs.

We then visited **Matsumoto Castle** and took the inside tour. There was a food festival happening right outside the castle, so we spent some time sampling local snacks.

Feeling hungry for a proper meal, we found **Kitchen Nankai („Ç≠„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„É≥ÂçóÊµ∑)**. This place was run by a super sweet and welcoming elderly couple whom you can watch making the food. The katsu curry was excellent, so we highly recommend this place if you can't reserve a spot to try the local soba noodles (or horse meat, if that's your thing).

While we didn't do it, I wish we had visited the **Daio Wasabi Farm**, as that would have been a unique experience.

**Day 7: Takayama**

We booked another highway bus from **Matsumoto** to **Takayama**. Keep in mind that during peak tourist months, you **must** book your bus or train tickets in advance to ensure availability.

After dropping off our stuff at our hotel, **Takayama Ouan**, our first stop was a restaurant to try local **Hida beef**. We went to **Hidagyu Maruaki**, where we tried some of the highest-quality Wagyu I've had. The wait was around an hour at 1:30/2:00 PM, so be prepared for wait times at popular Hida beef spots.

After lunch, we randomly hopped on a bus to the local **Hida Folk Village**. We bought an inclusive ticket for 800 yen at the bus station, which included bus transport to and from the village and the village admission fee. The bus ride was only about 10 minutes, and the village is about a 30-40 minute walk from our hotel if you prefer to walk.

The open-air museum was beautiful, and the autumn leaves were already turning colors, making it even more breathtaking. Some people say to only do Hida Folk Village or Shirakawa-go, but I found both were worthwhile.

**Day 8: Takayama**

In the morning, we started our walk to the **Miyagawa Morning Market** and decided to first stop by a local coffee shop called **Coffee Don**. They had a huge selection of flavored and classic coffee types, as well as baked pies.

From there, we perused the morning market and walked by the river. We decided to complete the **Higashiyama Walking Course**, which we wandered off intentionally at times, leading to some beautiful shrines and giving us a great layout of the town.

We stopped and did sake tasting at the **Funasaka Sake Brewery**, where you get a ceramic sake cup to take home for 100 yen, and tastings are about 100-200 yen each. It was super fun to gather the coins used for the tasting machines and try different varieties.

Another activity we didn't get to do but found interesting was the **Squirrel Forest Hidayama Wild Grass Nature Garden**, an animal sanctuary where you can hand-feed squirrels and chipmunks. (I tried to look up ethics on this place, but I found almost no information online).

**Day 9: Shirakawa-go and Kanazawa**

Since we only booked our bus tickets about three days in advance, there were no buses going straight from Takayama to Kanazawa. While there were train options, we wanted to save money and stick to our budget using buses. So, we ended up getting a bus from Takayama to **Shirakawa-go**, then booked another separate bus from Shirakawa-go to Kanazawa.

We booked the first bus available from Takayama to Shirakawa-go to ensure we could get one of the very few large luggage lockers at the bus terminal. There's an overflow area where they can hold bags and luggage if there are no more lockers, but it's more expensive, and there can be a long line.

Our bus arrived at 8:00 AM, and after storing our bags, we went straight to the **observation area** to get a beautiful view of the mist evaporating from the mountains. We enjoyed some pastries and coffee we'd packed while watching the mist roll over the mountains. It was an absolutely amazing view.

We spent about two more hours slowly wandering around Shirakawa-go village. By 9:30-11:30 AM, Shirakawa-go was packed with tourist buses, so **go early**.

We then hopped on our bus to **Kanazawa**. Our hotel was a 20-minute walk from the station and right next to **Omicho Market**. There are city buses that accept Pasmo cards, but walking was just as convenient for us.

We walked through the market and then decided to wander around Kanazawa without looking at maps, not knowing where we were going. We found ourselves at **Oyama Shrine** and its beautiful gardens, and immediately after, we were in the beautifully landscaped **Kanazawa Castle Park**.

The department store, **KANAZAWA M'ZA**, near Omicho Market was holding a special **Death Note** exhibition, but we did not get to go to that. If stuff like this interests you, look up anime or video game exhibitions in the cities you're visiting!

**Day 10: Kanazawa**

Since we only saw small parts of the parks the day before, we started our morning checking out **Kanazawa Castle Ruins** and the rest of **Kanazawa Castle Park**, then visited **Kenroku-en**, another beautiful park area located right next to the castle park.

On our way to the **Nagamachi (Samurai) District**, we came across a small bakery called **Pan Brothers**. **I LOVED THIS PLACE! If you cannot tell, bread is my favorite meal.** They had freshly baked goods, curry breads, katsu sandwiches, deli sandwiches, and more. It was cheap and super delicious‚ÄîI wish I'd bought more.

We spent some time visiting the Samurai district and then slowly made our way to the **Higashi Chaya District**, where we shopped for ceramics and did sake tasting at a local brewery.

From the Higashi Chaya district, we decided to get away from the crowd and do a 30-minute walk to a beautiful scenic overlook called **Miharashidai**. It was a bit of a hike, but it was completely worth it for the overlook of Kanazawa at sunset. There were only four other local people at the park, so it was a very quiet and serene moment we got to appreciate.

We made our way back to the district, where we treated ourselves to some huge and delicious fruit-stuffed crepes at **„ÇØ„É¨„Éº„Éó„Åç„ÅøÂ±ã** for dessert.

**Day 11: Kyoto**

We left Kanazawa super early to get to **Kyoto**. It was pouring rain that day, and unfortunately, our hotel was a 15-20 minute walk from the station, so we didn't have great access to buses. This was the one hotel someone recommended to us, but I personally wish I had done more research myself and chosen something different due to location.

We grabbed umbrellas and needed to duck into **KAEru Coffee** to escape the downpour. We loved what we got‚Äîdelicious affogato and freshly made banana bread and carrot cake.

We had time to walk through **Nishiki Market**, but as it was raining, there were an uncomfortable number of people hiding from the rain as well. From there, we decided to go to the **Kyoto Cultural Museum**. 

Honestly, it was extremely hot, humid, and rainy, so we weren't enjoying walking around much and made our way back to our hotel.

After a small break, we discovered a small Korean restaurant near us called **Takei**, which is owned by a super sweet Korean lady who makes the food right in front of you. We had amazing fried tofu, pork bowls, and jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles). The tiny restaurant is covered with artwork from people who have eaten there, and she leaves out paper and pencils if you'd like to draw something for her to put on her walls! Super great meal and would recommend this hidden gem.

There is the **International Manga Museum** and the **Nintendo Museum** in Kyoto that we wanted to do, but didn't get a chance. The Nintendo Museum requires you to buy tickets in advance, but we were not lucky enough to reserve a spot.

**Day 12: West Kyoto and Arashiyama Bamboo Forest**

We booked an express train the night before to get to the bamboo forest and found most of the earlier times booked, so we arrived at about 8:30 AM. During peak seasons, I suggest arriving at 6:00 AM because it was already extremely crowded when we arrived. The actual bamboo forest area that's best for photos is relatively small, so it got backed up with foot traffic quickly, with many people stopping to take photos. **Please don't be like these people and block the flow of traffic. It seems every-other person was an Instagram Influencer who brought large camera set ups and lights.**

The rest of the forest and town area was still really nice, so we walked around to the overlooks nearby and spotted the **Daihaikaku Senkoji Temple** located in the mountain across the river from the forest.

Determined to visit the temple we saw, we walked across the bridge and along the river to reach the walkway up to the temple. Note that this temple is very small and has an admission fee of 400 yen. It was a bit of a hike, but we enjoyed the view and the nature around us.

Since we passed the **Arashiyama Monkey Park** on the way to the temple, we made our way back and started up the mountain to get to the park. It was another hike, but it was well worth it to see the families of monkeys hanging out in the area! (I had looked up ethics for this one, and the information I found was that these are wild monkeys who stay in this area because of the food provided from tourists. If anyone has information that says otherwise, let me know and I will take this off of my recommendations!)

We stopped to get coffee and a breakfast set at **Caf√© Ranzan** (delicious but tourist prices). We then walked toward **Arashiyama Park**, where we found vendors selling mochi and candied strawberries.

There was a small festival/parade happening near **Nonomiya Shrine**, so we continued through the crowded streets to watch the procession. We walked upward past the shrine areas to the small pottery shops in the upper neighborhood areas. It was more steep walking but worth it. There was a small shop selling matcha tea, coffee, and craft beers that we stopped at before heading back into town.

We caught a bus to check out the **Kyoto Gyoen National Garden**. We walked around the garden area for a while and then stumbled upon a great Indian restaurant called **Salman and Sohel Halal Kitchen**. We had the thickest and biggest piece of naan bread ever. This place is absolutely worth checking out with its extensive menu and world-class chefs.

Despite our tired feet, we walked back toward our hotel near Kyoto Station. We ended our night at an ice cream/parfait store called **Cream Fest**.

**Day 13: Nara and Osaka**

We saw that it was quicker to get to **Nara** by train, but all seats were booked, so we went to Kyoto Station and headed to Nara by bus at 6:45 AM. The bus took about 45 minutes. The buses are usually not recommended due to traffic, so we left early in the morning to make sure we did not get as held back by morning rush-hour.

We walked directly from the station to the **Nara Deer Park**. Although it was only 7:45 AM, vendors were already selling deer crackers for 200 yen a stack. There weren't many people around, so we were immediately flocked by deer aggressively bowing at us for crackers. The harassment was fun until we ran out of crackers and got a few ""soft"" nudges and headbutts from male deer. We expected this behavior being some of the first tourists‚Äîthey definitely calmed down later in the day.

Unfortunately, many of the Nara sights we wanted to see were closed or under construction that day, so we spent time wandering the park area and seeing the more relaxed deer sleeping by the ponds. We paid the admission fee for a few shrines but decided not to do more.

Since we'd seen most of what we wanted in Nara and it was still early, we decided to take a train over to **Osaka** and spend half a day there. We visited **Osaka Castle** and a few other notable spots, then strolled through **Dotonbori** and another **Don Quijote** before needing to call it a day and head back to the hotel.

**Day 14: Kyoto**

We visited the **Fushimi Inari Shrine**, spending about two hours hiking and walking through it all. It was great exercise and felt satisfying to reach the very top. We arrived at 8:00 AM, and it was already extremely busy and crowded. 

Since it was heavily raining the day before, we started heading toward **Kiyomizu-dera Niomon Gate** to check out the surrounding shops and shrines. We perused the ceramics and souvenir shops, finding some really nice items, and then stumbled upon a slightly hidden **Studio Ghibli** store. Although the store sold Ghibli items you can find elsewhere, it was extremely well-decorated and whimsical. We then stopped by **Kiyomizu-dera Koyasu Pagoda**, **Yasaka K≈çshin-d≈ç Temple**, and **Gesshinin Temple**. We walked through **Maruyama Park** and visited **Yasaka Shrine**. 

Heading back toward our hotel, we noticed a particular ramen shop near Kyoto Station that always had a huge line, even as early as 6 AM. Our curiosity got the better of us, so we bought meal tickets from the vending machine and stood in line for about 30 minutes. The ramen place was **Honke Daiichi-Asahi** and was honestly one of the best ramen bowls we had during the entire trip. Everyone in the shop was so friendly, and the chefs were blasting anime theme music while they cooked. **Highly recommended!**

**Day 15: Back to Tokyo**

We had an 11:00 AM train to Tokyo from Kyoto. We arrived in Tokyo around 1:30 PM. It was another hot, humid, and rainy day, so we went to our hotel to drop off our stuff since we couldn't check in yet. There was a small caf√© nearby called **Tokyo Little House** where we hung out until check-in.

 We had plans to meet our friend and his girlfriend around 6:30 PM in **Shinjuku**, so we lazed around and walked around the neighborhood before heading out. We met them at an izakaya called **Azuma**. The place was quite interesting and eclectic, and we had a great evening ordering small plates and beers before heading to a karaoke place to end the night.

**Day 16: Tokyo Tower and Ramen Festival**

Despite being sleep-deprived from the night before, we started our day by stopping at **New Zealand Caf√© Akasaka** to make plans. 

We booked a last-minute reservation to visit **Tokyo Tower**. After the tower, we walked through the park next to it and saw that there was a **Kaiju No. 8** special pop-up exhibition happening near the **Tokyo Dome**. We had a great time looking at special artwork for the anime.

 Since there was a **Ramen Festival** (Tokyo Ramen Show) ongoing until November 4th, we decided to check it out. We took a bus to **Komazawa Olympic Park**, where we started off with two ramen tickets and tried some great ramen from places we wouldn't have experienced otherwise! They gave pretty good portion sizes per bowl for 1,100 yen, so we ended up not buying more tickets but wished we could have. The park has little convenience stores, and the festival was selling some desserts, so we got those before we left.

**Day 17: Souvenir Shopping in Tokyo**

Another rainy day. We hadn't taken the time to buy souvenirs for people back home, so we spent the day around **Akihabara** and going to the **Don Quijote** there for snacks and small items. 

We then took a train to **Sunshine City Shopping Center** to look at some **gachapon** machines since some friends wanted weird and unique items. 

Not finding all the weird stuff we wanted, we walked around the shopping center more and then made our way to **Happy Pancake Ikebukuro** since we hadn't tried fluffy pancakes yet. Good pancakes‚Äîvery fluffy‚Äîbut I guess I didn't get the hype. 

We dropped stuff off at our hotel and then headed out to **Harajuku Alta**, where we found another gachapon store called **Gacha Gacha no Mori Harajuku**. We liked this one better than Sunshine City because we found more hilarious and off-the-wall capsule toys. 

For dinner, we had AMAZING katsudon at a place near our hotel in Akasaka called **Happiness is KATSUDON Akasaka**, where I received the thickest pork cutlet I've ever had in my life. This was another one of my all-time favorite meals. The portions were so huge we regretted eating anything earlier in the day. The staff was so sweet, and we highly recommend this place.

**Day 18: Final Day and Departure**

We had to leave for our flight around 2:00 PM, so we did some small activities in the morning. We woke up early and first stopped at the **Akasaka Biz Tower**, which has a shopping center. My partner wanted to try the seasonal **Mela-Mela Frappuccino** that Starbucks in Japan had. We enjoyed people-watching from the Biz Tower while enjoying our drinks and food. 

We decided to take our time walking through the **Kokyo Gaien National Garden** and walking the path surrounding the **Imperial Palace**. We stopped at the **National Museum of Modern Art**. We finished the path around the Imperial Palace and made our way to a restaurant near our hotel called **TOMBOY Akasaka**, where we had a great lunch of curry and cheese naan before grabbing our bags held at the hotel and making our way to the airport. 

**A Redditor Encounter?**

Throughout our journey, we noticed we kept crossing paths with the same guy‚Äîfrom **Shinjuku** to **Matsumoto**, **Takayama**, **Shirakawa-go**, and finally **Kanazawa**. If you were this guy who was travelling during the dates I mentioned and saw a man and a woman in their late 20s traveling together, we wished we had actually spoken to you and hope you had an amazing trip! With the influx of tourists who all dress very similarly, we never spoke up as we could only be \~80% sure it was you. We accidentally caught a quick glance of the Reddit symbol on your phone, which of course included r/JapanTravel, as we walked by you on the bus to Matsumoto. It seemed like we got our info from the same place, so I'm curious of how your trip ended up.
