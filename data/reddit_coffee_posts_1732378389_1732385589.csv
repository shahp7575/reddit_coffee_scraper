After using years a deloghi ec850 I would like to update. After reading here I would like to ask about your option.

I don‚Äôt have a good grinder. I buy ground coffee, but to be honest, after a few days, it‚Äôs not that good anymore. I already decided in favor of an Eureka mignon specialist, but feel free to give your comment on that. 

Last month, I used a moka pot because I didn't like the taste of my deloghi anymore. It's also nice, and if properly made, it makes a good coffee, but it's a bit too simple in taste.

If it comes to the machine I cannot decide Between:

1. quick Mill Orion 3000
2. rancilio Sivia
3. lelit Anna
4. Gaggia Classic Evo

Do you have any other thoughts on that? I need something that makes easy very good coffee, I would love to dive deeper in the process, but with 40+job and kids its not realistic to spend more time with that hobby.



I also thought to go for a combi machine. But after reading more I see more disadvantages‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm very keen hearing your thoughts.

Wanting to get down to about 180-190lbs
I have gotten one of the apps that help me track calories/ macros and water intake, I am cutting out coffee and soda and opting for 0 calorie flavored water such as mio, propel or straight water, and planning to do a 16:8 fast from 8PM-12PM skipping breakfast since I only ever have time to eat junk in the morning.
 Supposedly my calorie goal is 2320 each day, is it okay to split that into 2 1100cal meals (lunch and dinner) and one small snack around 120cals, this would allow for bigger fuller meals as long as I can cut out the sugary drinks it seems like I wouldnt have to worry as much about over eating and instead put more focus into lowering the amount of fat and sugar in my diet?
I also am bouldering at my local rock climbing gym 3 days a week, and am interested in going on a 1-2 mile run on a few of the off days. Do I need to factor a protein shake after climbing into the 2320cals, or will it essentially replenish the calories lost by working out?

3. Reduction of screen time - I feel less stress on the eyes

1gy5p9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1gy5p9z/help_chronic_diarrhea/,Help - Chronic diarrhea ,"Hi, I'm 25 years old man and I have been experiencing diarrhea every single day for a year and a half.

I have a history of gastrointestinal issues when I was a teenager. I did a colonoscopy at the time and they said everything was normal. They diagnosed me with IBS (are we surprised).

10 years later, my symptoms are just worse than ever. No matter what I eat, I get diarrhea. Sometimes it's slushy/ mushy like pilled mashed potatoes or like a puddle of mud and other times I get explosive diarrhea and it's completely watery. It can smell like nothing and other times the smell is awful. My symptoms are chronic diarrhea, trapped gas who make a lot of noise (which can occasionally  be painful), pulses in my hypogastric region, nausea, fatigue, irritability, difficulty focusing, depression and anxiety, hives on my back, hair texture completely changed and they became super brittle and don't grow as fast and don't curl anymore. Another symptom is bloating. I usually get super bloated by the end of the day and back to normal the next morning. I've tried keto, Low FODMAP, lactose free, gluten free and NOTHING.  I've tried psyllium husk (the powder form and pills as well) and the only difference I noticed is I get constipated when taking the pills. The psyllium powder mixed with the water tends to make it worse somehow.

I don't really drink coffee and I believe I eat relatively healthy. My fridge and pantry looks like this : veggies (all kinds, I'm not a picky eater), fruits,  sauerkraut, jasmine rice, quinoa, sweet and normal potatoes, sourdough bread, lean ground beef, chicken breast, salmon, sardines, eggs, lactose free greek yogourt, lactose free butter, olive oil, avocado oil, nuts and nut butter, chia seeds, hemp seeds, dark chocolate, tea. I don't drink alcohol, I don't drink juice and soda. I only drink tap water. I don't smoke.

This chronic diarrhea is impacting my quality of life to the point where I no longer enjoy living.  My GP is convinced my diarrhea is caused by my anxiety but I KNOW for a fact that it is not.  He prescribed me antidepressants (Sertraline and Wellbutrin) which made my diarrhea even worse. I was literally shitting water, I'm not kidding. I would go buy Pedialyte to hydrate myself after an episode just to shit it right after. Toilet was completely blue (blue raspberry Pedialyte)

I got bloodwork done, nothing alarming. For tyroid, he tested my TSH only and that was normal. IgA test for celiac was normal as well. Did a stool test, no H-pylori, no E-coli and no salmonella. He wants to prescribe me Flagyl but I'm scared this will destroy my gut microbiome even more. I can't be the only one who thinks this is a bad idea to take antibiotics without even knowing the root cause.

Anyone went through a similar experience? Should I test for H-Pylori again? Should I ask for a complete celiac screening? A lactose intolerance test? Could it be SIBO or C-diff? Should I ask to get my Vit D, B-12 and Ferritin levels checked? Although I'm very lucky to have a family doctor, he's very passive. I feel like I'm the one doing most of the work. Some doctors don't know shit (no pun intended) about health. They just know about diseases and never seem to care to even dig deeper.

I know this is a long text and thank you if you made it this far. It's just a cry for help. I won't be able to go through this for much longer.",1,1732385042.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm currently working at a coffee shop to keep the lights on, and then applying after work. I tailor my resumes (which I feel like is silly because who has time to apply to jobs fulltime and survive with no savings‚Ä¶), I call up distant friends and family for leads, and nada.

I tried ER for the 4th time (story mission) and... I like it. 

Is it complicated? Yes. Do I still think it's not intuitive? Well, kinda. But after really setting aside my morning off with some good coffee and determination, all of the Eldritch themes do start to make sense BECAUSE they're a bit chaotic. 

Furthermore, at this point I can start to see some consistencies  within the madness, which allows me to focus on enjoying the game and strategy as opposed to re-reading and trying to memorize the affects.

I still have some reservation about the thematic creativity of these new expansions. All these new races are just new animal humanoids and Way of War is just... Feudal Japan? I love the game again though and I'm prepared to let em cook, so to speak.

1gy5irm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicMoldExposure/comments/1gy5irm/face_swelling_and_lymph_pain_what_is_your/,Face swelling and lymph pain - what is your experience detoxing,"I have dealt with toxic mold likely my whole life. I didn't realize this until a year and a half ago which is when I first started detoxing. My first round gave quick and immediate relief but I knew there were still deeper issues that weren't fixed. After going hard with treating mold issues and detoxing I shifted my focus because I also have lyme, bartonella, babesia, and erlichia and I started to experience more of those symptoms. Again I've seen great relief but I am back to thinking mold is my main issue now and have been addressing that hard for the last two weeks. I'd like to get advice from anyone who might have insight on my symptoms or who might have gone through the same thing and made it through the other side.

PSA: I am out of mold in a very clean environment, non of my items are contaminated, I am eating a low inflammatory and simple but healthy diet avoiding dairy, gluten (keeping it lower carb based) and processed sugars (keeping natural sugar intake low).

If you know them, I am taking the herbs from the [Cowden protocol](https://www.nutramedix.com/products/cowden-support-program-month-1-package). I had two months worth of the month one products and I figured what the heck I'm just gonna load up (my body can take, and needs, high levels of supplements to notice any difference). I am taking cycling doses of each product 3x a day. I am also doing coffee enemas with oil of oregano and black diamond binder from doc of detox (a version of humic and fulvic acid). I also am taking omega -3 with Co-q10 as well as NAC. I plan to add in activated charcoal and a methylated b vitamin complex once I can get them. Lastly I have been using colloidal silver nose spray for sinus mold colonization and would like to get EDTA as well. I am also drinking a much larger portion of water in a day but spaced out so I am drinking little bits throughout my day and I just started taking [trizomal glutathione](https://us.fullscript.com/catalog/products/trizomal-glutathione-7ba83d31-080d-4bad-878b-dbfa06d83264/U3ByZWU6OlZhcmlhbnQtMTA5NTAx) that has phosphotidylcholine (not sure how strong the amount is though)

My symptoms ***before*** I started this were face swelling and eye swelling plus redness in my eyes. I hadn't noticed how bad it was until one say a few weeks ago I really noticed the discomfort in my face (sinuses) was simply just not normal. I also have a rash that I suspect is from mold colonization that is systemic in my body but especially in my gut. I also have inflammation in my body that I have not been able to get to go away since 2021 when things got really bad and I was exposed to the worst toxic mold I've lived in. My body is holding onto 30 extra pounds of weight which I believe is connected to mold related issues.

My symptoms ***after*** I started all this (it has been about two weeks and some things I am just adding in over the last two days) include a lot of water retention -especially in my face, lymph pain in my underarms and chest especially although I feel it strongly in my legs and groin as well at times, aching in my bones (bone marrow = lymph is what I am thinking), pain on soles of feet (bart probably so lyme stuff) but **most of all** my face and eyes are going through it. So much swelling and my cheeks are very red and warm. My eyes are in pain often but then have short periods of time when they feel better than they ever have. This happens with my sinuses as well. I have short periods when all the sudden I can breath very well.

My question and what I am hoping to hear is that if I stay the course things should continue to purge out and get better. I believe they will but its such a mind game and it's hard to stay focused and consistent. I'd love to hear others experiences or thoughts on what I am going through. How long did it take for the sinuses to chill out, the pain in the lymphatic system to calm, will the inflammation ever go away?!

I've been on a wild journey lately trying to revamp my living room, and I thought I'd share what I learned after weeks of research and testing different furniture pieces.

Let me tell you, finding the perfect living room furniture isn't as simple as just picking what looks good in photos. I learned this the hard way after my first expensive mistake (we'll get to that story later).

The centerpiece of any living room has to be the sofa. After trying several options, I found this amazing piece on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/sofa) that completely transformed my space. It's not just about looks ‚Äì comfort is key when you're binge-watching your favorite shows or hosting game nights.

Beyond the sofa, you'll want to think about:

1. Coffee Tables: Go for something that matches your lifestyle. I have kids, so I picked one with rounded edges.

2. Storage Solutions: Entertainment centers aren't just for TVs anymore. They're perfect for hiding all those random items that somehow end up in the living room.

3. Accent Chairs: These are game-changers for both style and extra seating. Just make sure they complement your main sofa.

4. Lighting: Don't underestimate good lighting! I added both floor and table lamps to create different moods.

Here's the mistake I mentioned earlier: I once bought a beautiful white couch without considering my chocolate-loving kids and shedding dog. Big oops! That's why I now recommend checking out options like this practical yet stylish sofa (https://athometouch.com/sofa) that's both comfortable and durable.

Pro tips I wish I knew earlier:
- Measure your space twice, seriously
- Consider your lifestyle (pets, kids, entertaining)
- Think about maintenance and cleaning
- Don't forget about traffic flow
- Mix textures, not just colors

Remember, your living room should reflect your personality while being functional. It's where life happens ‚Äì movie nights, family gatherings, or just chilling with a book.

I've found that investing in quality pieces saves money in the long run. Trust me, I learned this after replacing cheap furniture multiple times.

Hello there peeps!

I've already posted here a number of times, so long story short: we are a group of more or less athletic people meeting **every Sunday at 11:00 AM at Park Gleisdreieck** to play some Touch Rugby. Don't know what to do with your Sunday? Just come by!

Don't be fooled by the name, there's **hardly any contact involved**, not with other players nor with the ground (look at how clean everyone is on the picture!). No previous experience is actually desirable since we teach the rules from scratch at the beginning of every session.

Basically, if you're keen on running and passing a ball around, just come down! All you need is a bottle of water and some somewhat grippy running shoes (e.g. football boots or synthetic grass boots). Weather permitting, we also usually go for a quick drink or coffee afterwards. Any questions, just let me know!

NB: if you're put off by the cold, I guarantee you won't be cold for long!

The Starbucks grande iced vanilla latte has two shots of espresso, 4 pumps of vanilla syrup, and milk up to the top line of their cup and then filled with ice.

When I make one (double shot) at home on my bambino machine, I do the 1:2 ratio of 17g in and about 34-36g out. One shot is not enough and two (double basket shots) shots is too much. I looked up how much is one Starbucks shot and it says about 1 ounce? So I have my little measuring cup and when I pour my shot out, it is around 1.5oz. Should I just let my shot run a bit longer to get the full 2 ounces or should I run my shots shorter and pull two shots to get two ounces? 

right now I have been either just adding a bit less milk to have the right ratio of coffee to milk and using that I have. But I would really love to be able to get the exact Starbucks recipe down with my machine, since I have a bunch of their grande cups I use to make the lattes at home with their measuring lines on it

1gy58rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/enmeshedfamilies/comments/1gy58rw/fathermy_filsonmy_boyfriend_enmeshed_from_15_to/,Father(my FIL)/son(my boyfriend) enmeshed from 15 to 32 years old. Suspected FIL was either gay or trans or travesty for years and turns out I was right.,"I've waited years to finally speak. Now it's my time.

I(29F) met by bf(32M)6 years ago. We fell in love and began dating. At the time he lived with his father alone( FIL and MIL divorced when bf was 16 and MIL moved out of the house).I had my own apartment and I am not close to my parents.FIL was overly kind and generous and lovebombing to his son and I did not see the red flags because my parents where neglectful, so any breadcrumbs of kindness and love makes me blind and naive.

My bf was 26 at the time and FIL cooked and decided what they would eat.FIL cleaned his room, did the dishes, his laundry, calling him 6 times a day when he was at work asking"" where are you my boy "" "" what are you doing right now my boy"" "" what do you want me to cook tonight for you my boy"".... As if he was 10 years old. My bf did not realise at the time he was enmeshed with his father.

FIL have a girlfriend for the past 15 years ( since the divorce with MIL) and FIL does not want to live with her, he wanted to specifically live alone with his son. My bf was excusing his father's behavior saying he was feeling alone since he's retired and divorced 15 years ago(even tho he have a gf for the past 15 years) and it occupied him, also its because he's the only son so there's ""no one else to love"".

Also his father being 70 at the time, he loved to complaint about his health declining even tho he never took care of his health(FIL is diabetic but still drinks 2l of Pepsi and pastas and chocolates everyday) My MIL then told me that he divorced him bc he was to overbearing and controling and that she feared that my bf(her son) took the role as a partner.

Years later in 2020 MIL revealed a secret to me : MIL caught by suprise FIL wearing lingerie, heels, makeup and a wig years ago before the divorce..... When she revealed this I saw all the red flags. I realized that FIL was verrrrry effeminated, verry not masculine and more ""nurturing""like a female/wife would. The manners, everything. Off course his son does not know any of this and did not figured it out because he was so enmeshed/mind controlled. FIL traveled at least two times/year to Thailand.... Without his gf.

FIL's girlfriend look verry masculine, she shared to me that she does not want/have sex with FIL. All those details in those years made me suspicious that FIL Is or always has been gay/trans/travesty and the enmeshement with his son was a way for FIL to live his fantasy to have a romantic relationship with a man.... Using his own son like a pawn to play husband, also using his ex-wife(MIL) and current gf to hide it and play the pretend game.

In 2020 my bf bought FIl's house. The agreement was that FIL had until 2021 to move out. FIL moved out in 2024.... 4 months ago. It took my bf 10 months of therapy * he was in denial in 2022 and 2023 * just to confront/convince his father to leave HIS OWN HOUSE. Even MIL told FIL ""you need to leave your son's house or I will make you leave !"".

As a GF, I have a lot of resentment towards my FIL because he's selfish and at my BF because he enabled the situation ny not establishing boundaries. On the other hand how can you establish boundaries when you are mind controlled? So I accumulated all this rage inside of me for the past 6 years.

Also I suspected that the moment FIL would leave and live on his own for the first time in his life at 74 he will either let himself rot to die in his brand new condo or make himself more sick to guilt-trip his son to be his husband/nurse. He did exactly that.6 months that FIL was living alone (from june 2024 to November 2024)* he was not alone, we would visit him regularly like 2x per week for an hour or two to have a coffee and talk*, me and my bf finally having intimacy, that FIL died 4 days ago.

FIL did not took his insulin as he was supposed to (intentionally i think)they said at the ER when FIL was declared dead, and died of an heart attack. My BF is completely devastated and filled with guilt because he just started to establish healthy boundaries with his father and he rotted to die. He did not suffer from dementia nor alzheimer.

When my BF visited and cleaned his condo to get the papers and pictures for the funerals this week, he looked into his father's computer to see hundreds and hundreds of pictures and videos of young thailandese ladies... I thought to myself ""they are lady-boys not ladies"".

Sooner or later his son will discover his father's secret and I don't know how it will go. I really don't care that he's gay but the thing is my bf will realise that he was a husband/pawn and that will destroy his whole reality and sens of self..... it's a ticking time bomb.... and it's out of my control and I cannot do nothing to protect him from futur traumas. Enmeshement is a nasty disease..... Also RIP to my FIL ;*( To finish on a positive note by bf is a changed man since therapy. It saved his life. He's feeling finally like a man, not daddy's boy/ husband. He's mourning the loss of his father and he's mourning the toxic love that he tough was real love from his father. I'm so proud of him and the progress he made in the past year and I'm sure his father is extremely proud , being in the sky above and watching him healing this generational trauma <3 <3 <3.",1,1732383854.0,enmeshedfamilies,0,1.0,False
1gy585k,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1gy585k/hi/,Hi,"I was born under a sky that couldn‚Äôt quite make up its mind‚Äîsunny or stormy, the eternal question. And honestly, that‚Äôs kind of how I‚Äôve lived my life. One minute, I‚Äôm sipping coffee like it‚Äôs the nectar of the gods, the next I‚Äôm convinced I prefer tea. Consistency? Overrated.

I‚Äôm a certified over-thinker, but I‚Äôve also mastered the fine art of walking into a room and immediately forgetting why I‚Äôm there. My days are spent balancing practicality with a vivid imagination, and let me tell you, fantasy wins 99% of the time. Why face reality when you can imagine dragons giving you life advice?

Books are my escape, my hobby, my calling‚Äîbasically my whole personality at this point. I could live in a library if I had to. There‚Äôs just something magical about the smell of old pages and the promise of endless new worlds. ‚ÄúJust one more chapter‚Äù is my life motto, and yes, I‚Äôve said it at 2 a.m. with zero regrets.

I‚Äôm a sucker for dark romance, but let‚Äôs get one thing straight‚ÄîI don‚Äôt believe every character needs to have their parents tragically offed for drama. Plot twists are fun, sure, but why overdo it? When I‚Äôm not deep in fictional angst, I‚Äôm probably trying to make dinner feel like a medieval feast, complete with goblets and mysterious soup. It‚Äôs the small things.

In my dream world, more coffee shops would be open at 3 a.m., because that‚Äôs when the best ideas (and existential thoughts) happen. Ideally, I‚Äôd live next to a bakery run by a talking cat, though knowing my luck, it‚Äôd be the sassiest cat on the planet.

I‚Äôve read a thousand ‚Äúhow-to-adult‚Äù guides, but I‚Äôm still not sure I‚Äôm doing it right. Spoiler: no one really knows. At least I‚Äôm good at pretending to have it together, though I sometimes do it while wearing pajamas and avoiding my laundry pile. My wardrobe is a mix of ‚ÄúI could rule a kingdom in this‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not leaving the house today, am I?‚Äù That pretty much sums me up.

My heroic journey? It‚Äôs not battling monsters or uncovering ancient secrets. It‚Äôs trying to remember all my passwords. Digital security is great until I‚Äôm five password attempts deep and questioning all of my life choices.

When I‚Äôm not nose-deep in a book, you can find me wandering through grocery stores. I believe in giving every story a chance‚Äîthough houseplants? Maybe not so much. Those are hard.

I firmly believe that life should be a healthy balance of humor, deep thoughts, and snacks. Mostly snacks, if we‚Äôre being real.


Anyways, I‚Äôm looking to connect with some interesting people here, so feel free to shoot me a message if you‚Äôd like to chat! A little about me: I‚Äôm 20, female, and enjoy deep conversations as much as light-hearted banter. I‚Äôd love to exchange stories, thoughts, and maybe even a few laughs with someone new.

If anything about this post resonates with you, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear from you and see where the conversation goes!

Looking forward to meeting some amazing people!",2,1732383809.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

1gy4uai,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1gy4uai/mom_came_to_see_me_after_her_passing/,Mom came to see me after her passing,"My mom died from cancer in the home they had lived in for many years.  This was her wish and I was glad that it could happen.  Even ill she looked pretty in her pink night dress and robe.  It still makes me cry almost 30 years later.  I mean we expect to have to bury our parents at some point, but that she had to go that way still breaks my heart.  

Anyway, the second day after her passing we had made the final arrangements with the funeral home and went shopping for a suit for my dad.  That night my mom came and sat on my bed with a gentle smile on her face.  She was radiant wearing her pink nightgown and robe.  She said she really like the ""charcoal gray"" suit that dad bought.  We had ended up buying 2 suits.  One black and the gray one.  I told her that I couldn't do that right now because it was still so hard that she was gone.  She told me everything was going to be alright and then poof she was gone.  I chalked it up to a dream and my mind looking for a way to comfort me.  

I was doing my best to keep it together for my dad who lost his life mate after being married for so long.  I wasn't going to mention seeing mom because I thought he would just give me that look of his which had motived many soldiers over the years and all us kids.  (He was ill too at the time.)  Dad was a career military man and it was usual to find him up drinking his black coffee at 4 am.  I got up because I couldn't sleep and as I was walking to the bathroom, he was sitting in his recliner with his mug of coffee in the dark so he wouldn't disturb anyone.  He stopped me in my tracks when he said ""Your mother came to see me last night and said she really likes the ""charcoal gray"" suit you picked out for me."" 

It blew me away!  She visited both of us the same night and said almost word for word the same thing.  (Dad slept in the RV because he couldn't bare sleeping in their bed without her.) 

I really felt her presence for several weeks after she passed.  Finally dad said he was going to hit the road in their RV because he just couldn't take all the reminders of mom.

Mom passed in April and I had planted daffodils for her because she had always had lots of plants.  The first daffodil had bloomed not too long after her funeral.  I took it to the cemetery and left it in a vase.  We got a late ice then snow storm the next day so it was a few days later that I went to the cemetery again.  Guess what?!?  The daffodil looked perfect.  It should have been withered and shriveled looking.  How is it possible after the ice and bitter cold with 4 or 5 inches of snow and ice? 

I have always been interested in the paranormal and enjoy a good scary movie, but I am also a skeptic.  I have always looked for another cause for whatever paranormal event that I had heard about.  I mean I love a good mystery.  Maybe this was all wishful thinking, but a shared experience tends to make it a little more real to me. If it had just been my experience, I would have just written off.

I am back after some time away from here. I was told previously that as I start to heal, I will want to be here less and less. Much like many of the things this group told me, that was true. I pop back every so often but it's been many months since I was here. 

I have been doing really. Like really well. It's amazing how things have improved exponentially. I am still in therapy, I think it's now a year to the day I made my first appointment. It's been great for me to explore myself and the reasons why I ended up in the position I did. It's also been wonderful just to have someone to talk to every few weeks and to update on my progress and discuss real life problems with. 

I'm doing normal things again, dating again, I feel good on most days. The house is clean, the chores are (mostly done) and most importantly, I feel younger. I am also going about things differently (hopefully better) and it seems to be working for me. 

I am still struggling with trust though, and I have identified quite a few triggers that can very quickly and very powerfully back to a bad place, though the timeframe is much shorter and I'm very able to sit with the feeling without necessarily responding. 

All in all, I'm 100x the person I was a year ago. 

My ex has pretty much being staying away too. It took a little while for her to really give me the space I wanted, and probably slightly too long for me to set the boundaries I needed, but I got there. The other day though, she asked if she could come and see the cat and pick up a box of final things that I'd put together. I agreed. 

She came over and was perfectly amicable. She did proceed to make a coffee and eat her dinner...but I'll let it slide. She didn't really ask me about my life (and I'd rather she didn't) but did proceed to be forthcoming about hers. 

She let slip accidentally on purpose that she is poly now. She also said that monogamous relationships make her feel sick now and she hates how everyone does this. She's very picky about partners though (apparently). She wants to start selling her panties again and is back on the toxic website she hated so much showing herself off. She said all this after showing me this self help book she's been reading. 

Now, each to their own. I have no problem with how anyone chooses to live their life. There's no judgement here, only interest (for some reason). 

Has anyone else experienced this change in their ex post breakup? Is it common for people with bpd/npd to 'suddenly decide' they are poly and hate mono relationships? 

She sounded so confident and well. Not like someone who was still falling apart and crying in front of me 5 months ago. She sounded, honestly good. Happy. And I'm glad for her. But I guess I'm suspicious of it. 

Which brings me to my next question of 'why do I care?' 

Because I'll admit, a small part of me does care. And I'm just not sure why it tickles me. I have considered jealously or envy and sort of discarded those. I'm very happy with my lot. And I think top of the candidates right now is almost frustration. I guess I'm frustrated that she's doing well? I'm glad she's happy but maybe there's a small part of me that wanted to watch her fail, not prove that she is desirable to others. It's sad to say really. That's not the person I want to be. But I went through so much pain through her hands, perhaps it's only natural at this stage. 

Anyway, the visit ended quickly and the cat was somewhat happy to see her. I don't think there will be any visits in the future. I can't reignite old wounds. 

Thanks in advance all if you've made it this far. And THANK YOU to this group for being here. You saved my life, truly 

TLDR
She came over and admitted being poly and sounded happy. This irked me for some reason, I am interested in why.

I remember her eyes full of tears while I was listening to my uncle's congrats. Fuck those doctors who took too much time that could have been crucial for my dad.

He replied I have a girlfriend but if I wasn't I would have you asked for a drink

After that we saw eachother at work first time taking ever he was very nervous but in s pleasant way like his eyes were super shiny

After that I sent him a message and told me thank you for being nice and not making things awkward then he said for the record you are really attractive and then said sorry I don't know why I said that

After that we kept messaging about life and then he came over and showed me his pictures and we were laughing and making a connection

I had a moment of fear during the chat as if I felt than maybe since he is now closed to me he can see flaws and then maybe he doesn't like mannerisms

But after that we kept talking he was laughing

Then I pushed it a bit and asked if he wanted my camera, he refused and said thank you , he said buy coldly

I apologized if I overstepped

He sent me a thump up, very cold

I could see he was online the all time till late , he never does maybe he was rethinking about what he wrote to me and feeling guilty

The day after he came to say Hi but he avoided talking to me and eye contact

I told him oh you scared me when you said hi and he said everything ok?

I Saud I didn't sleep and I apologized again about pushing the camera, he said no worries it was nice of you not many people would have done that

Today I went and passed by and said morning to him , he looked nervous and he said morning back without looking at me in the eyes

My colleague said that we was trying to pass by me but he changed path probably didn't want me to say anything

I am assuming is because he felt so alive during the conversation with me that he got scared and pulled away

Today he passed by once, kept his eyes down as he used to do when we didn't know each other

Other times he passed keeping his head turned away from him

Except for once where he looked over and at the end before he left, I saw him looking briefly, i don't turn, he turned away to leave

Now I can assume that we are together and this is unfolding right now, but it's very difficult for me not to focus on the 3D, aka is girlfriend and that she is going to disappear overnight. I know I am choosing a version of him that chooses me and it's not about changing the version of him that Is in the relationship but I see him everyday and I get triggered and I can't stop the logic mind. What can I affirm? As next step? Something that doesn't give me so much resistance like us being already together. Can I affirm that his behaviour ( he ignoring me )means that he cannot resist me and he is reaching out for a coffee because he cannot stop thinking about me?

Or will it keep it in the future and let me wait

I just want to find something believable and do it in step


I also feel very ashamed of my behaviour because I was nervous about was happening I was talking loud to get his attention and I got into s small argument with s colleague and I was very petty, now I think that he has seem this and thinks I am immature and aggressive and better to stay away from me, don't know how to remove this feeling of shame ",1,1732382366.0,manifestingSP,0,0.99,False

As someone in the twilight of my 40s, divorced, and looking to meet new people, I‚Äôve realized how tough it can be to find spots that are truly conducive to socializing. Sure, live music and comedy acts are entertaining, but they‚Äôre not exactly the best settings for striking up meaningful conversations. If you‚Äôre in the same boat, let‚Äôs brainstorm: where can we go to meet people in a laid-back, welcoming environment?

My Wishlist for the Perfect Place

Casual and Comfortable: A place where you can relax without feeling out of place if you‚Äôre alone.

Conversation-Friendly: Somewhere where the volume isn‚Äôt cranked to 11, making it possible to chat without shouting.

Regulars Welcome: A spot with a sense of community, where you might actually see familiar faces over time.


Here are a few ideas I‚Äôve come up with, but I‚Äôd love to hear your suggestions too‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre younger, older, or anywhere in between.

Ideas for Meeting New People

Coffee Shops

Coffee shops aren‚Äôt just for caffeine junkies or students anymore. Many have an inviting vibe, comfy seating, and a mix of patrons that makes for great people-watching and even better conversations. Look for local spots with open mic nights, book clubs, or art displays‚Äîthese events often attract folks who are open to connecting.

Community Centers or Classes

Taking a class‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs cooking, painting, or even improv‚Äîgives you a built-in reason to interact with others. Shared interests can be an excellent icebreaker, and you‚Äôll have something to talk about right off the bat.

Pubs and Breweries

Not every bar has to be loud and bustling. Many local pubs and breweries offer a more laid-back atmosphere, trivia nights, or board games that encourage mingling. Bonus points if the staff is friendly and the place feels like a second home.

Parks and Outdoor Events

As the weather allows, parks can be great places to meet people. Look for group yoga sessions, farmer‚Äôs markets, or outdoor movie nights. These settings often draw a diverse crowd and can spark casual, easy conversations.

Volunteering Opportunities

What better way to meet kind-hearted people than by giving back to your community? Whether it‚Äôs a food bank, animal shelter, or a local event, volunteering connects you with others who share your values.

A Call for Recommendations

If you‚Äôve found a great place to meet people in your area‚Äîor you‚Äôve stumbled on hidden gems that aren‚Äôt on most people‚Äôs radar‚Äîplease share! Whether it‚Äôs a cozy wine bar, a library event, or even a quiet diner with a killer pie menu, I‚Äôm all ears.

This stage of life is an opportunity to explore and connect without pressure. Maybe together, we can all find our version of ‚ÄúCheers‚Äù‚Äîa place where we can laugh,

1gy4lqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/salestechniques/comments/1gy4lqv/prospecting_and_how_to_do_it_d/,Prospecting and how to do it! :D,"Let‚Äôs be honest: cold calling can feel like banging your head against a wall when you‚Äôre calling the wrong people. I‚Äôve been there‚Äîspending hours dialing, only to hear ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not interested‚Äù or worse‚Ä¶ silence.

Then I realized something: the problem wasn‚Äôt my script. It wasn‚Äôt my tone. It wasn‚Äôt even the fact that I get slightly sweaty during awkward pauses. The problem was *who* I was calling.

So, I switched things up, and now I‚Äôm laser-focused on targeting the right prospects before I ever pick up the phone. Here‚Äôs the system I use to make sure every call has a purpose:

# 1. Get Clear on Who You‚Äôre Calling

First step: define your ideal customer. This isn‚Äôt rocket science, but so many of us skip it. Think about it‚Äîwho actually *needs* your product or service? Narrow it down by industry, company size, and job title.

For example: If you‚Äôre selling HR software, you‚Äôre probably targeting HR managers or directors at mid-sized companies.

# 2. Use the Right Tools (Because Google Stalking Isn‚Äôt Enough)

Here are the tools that have been total game-changers for me:

* **LinkedIn Sales Navigator:** The king of finding decision-makers. Seriously, just filter by job title and you‚Äôre golden.
* **Apollo.io:** This one‚Äôs a lifesaver‚Äîit finds verified email addresses and contact info faster than I can finish my coffee.
* **Google Alerts:** Want to sound like you know your prospect‚Äôs world? Set alerts for their company name and drop a casual ‚ÄúCongrats on the expansion‚Äù in your call.

# 3. Research = Personalization = Wins

This is where things get fun (or nerdy, depending on your vibe). Before I call, I grab 2-3 key insights about the prospect:

* What‚Äôs their role in the company?
* What challenges might they be dealing with?
* Any recent company news or trends I can mention?

Then, I tailor my pitch. Instead of the generic ‚ÄúWe help companies save money,‚Äù I‚Äôll say:  
‚ÄúHi \[Name\], I saw your team is growing‚Äîhow are you handling \[specific challenge\]?‚Äù

Suddenly, I‚Äôm not just another random salesperson. I‚Äôm someone who gets it.

**Bonus Tip:**  
Block out one hour a day for prospect research. I know it sounds boring, but trust me‚Äîit‚Äôs the difference between calling 50 people who hang up and 10 people who actually want to talk.

I go deeper into this in my latest video, where I walk through how I research prospects live and find decision-makers. If you want to see the full breakdown, check it out here:

The prices have never been low, but the prices used to mean I could order my customized latte at any store and know it'd be made to the same high standard. . . Not anymore. 

I get a Chai tea, no water, whole milk, espresso, sugar and white chocolate mocha sauce. Not a frequent indulgence and definitely a pricey one. 

Normally, it delivers a smooth, sweet caffeine jolt with rich steamed cream soothing my stomach for a busy morning. Not any more. 

Now the baristasa are almost always yet another new worker who don't care or don't know how to make a good drink. The recipe is rarely if ever followed. The texture, toppings, flavor, temperature, taste and even tidyness of the drink vary wildly! 

This morning's purchase came out watery, lukewarm, spicy on top and bland underneath. Idk what to do. I could drive back to return it, but at this point I don't think they're gonna improve. 
I can't even order a basic cup of coffee since the only thing they'll have brewed is pike place (bleh!) and even that's not likely to be hot.

They definitely taste... interesting and strong, very different from my moka pot. So I guess I'm doing something right? But I'm still confused by a few things...

I pump boiling water preheat and then again before pump and the container is quite hot to hold when pumping. But the espresso seems to cool super fast (it's basically just ""warm"" even if I drink immediately), maybe because of how little fluid there is and I feel it probably contributes to the acidity.

I use self roasted and 1 week rested coffee too that needs to bloom in Aeropress.

The pumping action seems quite easy, I can pump it all the way down 3 times per second.

I do the 8 pump preinfusion, 10 seconds wait. Then pump 3 more timaes and the flow starts. It looks somewhat normal and only tiny bit of crema (or just foam) or some foam weirdly sticks to the filter, but the coffee flows through start to finish about 10 seconds.

I've tried tamping softer and tamping hard and anything from 11 to 7 clicks on a Timemore C2 (I use 9 on my mokapot and 11 on aeropress). It doesn't seem to make a big difference in anything oddly.

1gy4ez1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrarunning/comments/1gy4ez1/need_backyard_ultra_advice/,Need Backyard Ultra advice‚Ä¶,"I recently attempted to see how I would fare in a typical backyard ultra setup; I had a day of PTO to burn and figured I‚Äôd set aside those eight hours to try it out.  I selected a nearby park with a small lake around which I could run laps (each lap is approximately a half mile) and had my car parked at a perfect location where I would end each 4.1-ish loop and then use said car as something of an aid station. 
 
A little background; I‚Äôm primarily a cyclist and average over 10K miles a year, but I also run, with my highest running year a few years ago at 1K miles, though this year and last my miles haven‚Äôt quite reached that number again.  That said, I‚Äôve done a handful of half marathons, and have been extremely interested in the world of ultra running, specifically events like the Barkley and such (typical road races haven‚Äôt quite grabbed my attention).  I‚Äôve been wanting to do some sort of ultra trail event for some time, and when I learned of the format of a backyard ultra it seemed quite attractive.
 
Everything about the day was fine; overcast with some wind, but nothing too bad in that regard, and even though we‚Äôd had snow fall the day before it had almost completely melted by the time I set out to try this.  I had water, coffee, a change of clothes/shoes and a headlamp for when it gets dark early this time of year; again, I knew this wouldn‚Äôt be the typical length of most backyard ultras, but I figured eight hours would give me a taste.
 
The first three loops were fine; running at a slow-ish Zone 2 pace was unusual, but I knew necessary for something like this.  A lap around the lake is a mix of parking lot/sidewalk, some slight elevation punches and some stonework, so it‚Äôs a bit of everything, but nothing crazy.  By the time I hit the fourth or fifth lap, I was noticing some slight strain/ache/soreness in my quads and hip flexors, though this would somewhat subside by the time I started another loop.  In between loops I took time to hydrate, sit and look over work emails (I usually had about twelve minutes of rest time).  I also stretched a few times as well.
 
Once I hit the sixth loop, the strain was starting to migrate down to my calves a bit, and my average pace was slowing a bit as well.  I then started on loop seven but then stopped after I hit slightly over marathon length.  I‚Äôm not sure if I could‚Äôve kept going, but I doubt it to an extent. 
 
From a cardiovascular standpoint, I felt fine, never out of breath and my heart rate had no difficulty coming down in between loops.  My feet also gave me no issues as well.  It was just my legs that were the issue; any thoughts on what I can do to improve?  I should also mention I intermittent fast and had a big meal the night before of pasta and rice, so I never once felt bogged down or had any gut issues during the run.  I do wonder if I should have been using electrolytes, but I neglected to put them in the car and didn‚Äôt realize until after I was near the park.  I also know that, if I intend to go for significantly longer distances, I will need to fuel and that is perfectly fine; in the meantime, I just want to figure out what I can do about my legs (one day after and I‚Äôm still feeling it, thought my hip flexors don‚Äôt feel bad).  
 
Any other pieces of advice?  I know everyone‚Äôs built different, but I‚Äôd like to get better and see if I can do this for real at some point, in addition to a non-backyard ultra as well (which, I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs a better option, as it doesn‚Äôt have those mandatory hour loop starts).  I apologize for the length of this, but I‚Äôm feeling a bit discouraged.

Hi guys!

Recently i‚Äòve been wanting to upgrade from my Sage/Breville Barista Express to an endgame machine that for sure won‚Äòt be needing any upgrade the next years to come. 
I‚Äòve had my BSE for around 4 years now. It‚Äòs been great. It‚Äòs paired with a Timemore 064s and and a Niche Zero, to cover both flat & conical burr scenarios. 
While the BSE still continues to make very tasty drinks, my girlfriend and i drink most of the time milk based drinks. Main reason is steam wand power and ability to steam twice the quantity of milk. 
Heating up in the morning is no problem for me, as i like to wake up and drink my coffee peacefully before me or her go to work. So first thing while i wake up is turn the machine on, and untill i am ‚Äûsuited up‚Äú, (20 mins or so) the machine is already hot. This is a habit i already do with the BSE. 
I am down between the Bianca and the newely ACS Falcon. Both priced very similar in the EU (around 2000-2500‚Ç¨ mark depending on the vendor, shipping included). 

As i said, main reason is the steam power, but here are some more:
- ability to have flow control on both;
- dual boiler;
- display on both;
- pid;

Key difference between the two is that with ACS you are going through a sales representative, customization ability, much more like a high end automobile. 
What i also like on ACS is the lever style steam actuator, rather than the turn switch on the Bianca. 

Disadvantage of ACS is that i cannot find any pics, reviews or workflow videos to have at least an idea on how this thing operates. 
Anyone having the ACS Falcon yet from here and can share the experience?
As well, and other machine recommendations would be highly appreciated. 

Thank you!

I was trying to do controlled breathing and started heading home. I took a turn, was super lightheaded for a couple of seconds, felt a pop in the back of my neck and then I could suddenly breathe fine. Should I go to the ER?

1gy4dnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/1gy4dnq/need_backyard_ultra_advice/,Need Backyard Ultra advice‚Ä¶,"I recently attempted to see how I would fare in a typical backyard ultra setup; I had a day of PTO to burn and figured I‚Äôd set aside those eight hours to try it out.  I selected a nearby park with a small lake around which I could run laps (each lap is approximately a half mile) and had my car parked at a perfect location where I would end each 4.1-ish loop and then use said car as something of an aid station. 
 
A little background; I‚Äôm primarily a cyclist and average over 10K miles a year, but I also run, with my highest running year a few years ago at 1K miles, though this year and last my miles haven‚Äôt quite reached that number again.  That said, I‚Äôve done a handful of half marathons, and have been extremely interested in the world of ultra running, specifically events like the Barkley and such (typical road races haven‚Äôt quite grabbed my attention).  I‚Äôve been wanting to do some sort of ultra trail event for some time, and when I learned of the format of a backyard ultra it seemed quite attractive.
 
Everything about the day was fine; overcast with some wind, but nothing too bad in that regard, and even though we‚Äôd had snow fall the day before it had almost completely melted by the time I set out to try this.  I had water, coffee, a change of clothes/shoes and a headlamp for when it gets dark early this time of year; again, I knew this wouldn‚Äôt be the typical length of most backyard ultras, but I figured eight hours would give me a taste.
 
The first three loops were fine; running at a slow-ish Zone 2 pace was unusual, but I knew necessary for something like this.  A lap around the lake is a mix of parking lot/sidewalk, some slight elevation punches and some stonework, so it‚Äôs a bit of everything, but nothing crazy.  By the time I hit the fourth or fifth lap, I was noticing some slight strain/ache/soreness in my quads and hip flexors, though this would somewhat subside by the time I started another loop.  In between loops I took time to hydrate, sit and look over work emails (I usually had about twelve minutes of rest time).  I also stretched a few times as well.
 
Once I hit the sixth loop, the strain was starting to migrate down to my calves a bit, and my average pace was slowing a bit as well.  I then started on loop seven but then stopped after I hit slightly over marathon length.  I‚Äôm not sure if I could‚Äôve kept going, but I doubt it to an extent. 
 
From a cardiovascular standpoint, I felt fine, never out of breath and my heart rate had no difficulty coming down in between loops.  My feet also gave me no issues as well.  It was just my legs that were the issue; any thoughts on what I can do to improve?  I should also mention I intermittent fast and had a big meal the night before of pasta and rice, so I never once felt bogged down or had any gut issues during the run.  I do wonder if I should have been using electrolytes, but I neglected to put them in the car and didn‚Äôt realize until after I was near the park.  I also know that, if I intend to go for significantly longer distances, I will need to fuel and that is perfectly fine; in the meantime, I just want to figure out what I can do about my legs (one day after and I‚Äôm still feeling it, thought my hip flexors don‚Äôt feel bad).  
 
Any other pieces of advice?  I know everyone‚Äôs built different, but I‚Äôd like to get better and see if I can do this for real at some point, in addition to a non-backyard ultra as well (which, I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs a better option, as it doesn‚Äôt have those mandatory hour loop starts).  I apologize for the length of this, but I‚Äôm feeling a bit discouraged.

I (25M) have a close friend, ""Sarah"" (31F), who recently adopted an adorable little dog named Biscuit. Biscuit is sweet and well-behaved, but Sarah has been taking him everywhere‚Äîand I mean everywhere.

At first, I didn‚Äôt mind. When she brought him to casual hangouts at my place or the park, it was fine. But lately, it‚Äôs escalated. She brought Biscuit to a dinner party I hosted without asking. My apartment isn‚Äôt exactly pet-proof, and Biscuit knocked over a vase (nothing expensive, but still). She also brought him to a coffee shop hangout where he barked at other dogs, making it hard for us to have a conversation.

The final straw was last weekend when we went to a semi-formal brunch with a group of friends, and Sarah showed up with Biscuit in tow. It was clear the restaurant wasn‚Äôt thrilled about it, and I felt embarrassed in front of the group.

After the brunch, I pulled Sarah aside and politely asked her to maybe leave Biscuit at home for certain events, especially ones where it‚Äôs not appropriate or where pets might not be welcome. She got defensive and said Biscuit is like her baby and she doesn't see why she should exclude him from anything.

Now Sarah is giving me the cold shoulder and has told some of our mutual friends that I ""hate her dog,"" which isn‚Äôt true. I just think there‚Äôs a time and place for pets.

Some of my friends think I‚Äôm being reasonable, but others say I‚Äôm overreacting and should just let Sarah bring Biscuit wherever she wants since ""he‚Äôs not hurting anyone.""

Sometimes on the weekend mornings, like almost first thing he will drive 3 mins down the street to the gas station, saying he is getting a coffee. We have a cappuccino maker at home (his purchase) but he says sometimes he just wants a black gas station coffee. Idk what bad thing he could possibly be doing during such a short period and we share locations so I can see that he is going to the gas station and coming back. It just seems really weird to me and we already have some minor trust issues so I'm just wondering if I am crazy or not I guess. 

 For some background, we have been married for 4 years and have a young child. We have been having a few issues that we are working on in counseling. I don't think he's having an affair necessarily, but there have been some weird signs. I know that he isn't quite satisfied with our sex life and we could also just be spending more 1 on 1 time generally. I have noticed that he watches porn and masturbates a lot, and has like a 'need' to do it at times, I've found receipts for onlyfans and other stuff like that here and there on his phone but nothing else. Not sure if there is something more there, I'm okay with porn but it seems excessive at times. The other red flag is that he likes to get massages at those thai places. He claims it's because they take last minute appointments and he doesn't like to plan in advance/it doesn't work for his schedule bc his work schedule can be inconsistent, which is legit I guess. But with the rest of the context I have wondered if he has gotten a happy ending there or something.

Sound quality-wise, these seem to be the best wired and wireless headphones respectively.

I have APP2, but I usually study longer than the battery life. I‚Äôm not too  sensitive with audio quality.

I plan on connecting either to my Ipad and to my Windows PC for studying/gaming. I know wired is usually the best, but I also want to factor in noise cancellation. the Dt770‚Äôs are passive while the senn‚Äôs have active ones.

Ill be staying at home, but it‚Äôs noisy enough to warrant the need for noise cancelling.  I guess to describe the noise level,  my father who‚Äôs in the same room as me constantly shouts due to him bursting his ear drums when he was young. He plays everything at max volume and he doesn‚Äôt really understand why he needs to tone it down(great roommate i know).  I usally play music while reading, but when I have to understand something/ ‚Äúlock in‚Äù  I turn the music off and so I have to rely on the Passove/active Noise cancelling.

 I‚Äôm leaning towards the DT770‚Äôs as it‚Äôs also good for gaming and it‚Äôs wired so it doesn‚Äôt have a battery, but can it cancel out the noise of someone talking/watching stuff? My only experience with headphones was some cooler master Mh752‚Äôs and they cancelled out noise pretty decently.


I could do a funny and buy both but, I don‚Äôt see the need to do this. Which do you guys think would be more convenient?


edit: the pros for the M4 I guess are ANC and it‚Äôs wireless, so i can just connect it to my Ipad pc and phone fairly easily

cons are apparently worse quality compared to something wired.  


Pros for the DT770 are better quality and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be pleather. A lot cheaper. Wired so when it‚Äôs for PC use there isn‚Äôt any problem

1gy45jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1gy45jq/i_21f_dropped_out_of_a_wedding_party_because/,"I, 21(F) dropped out of a wedding party because bride 23(F) said I wasn‚Äôt a good bridesmaid or friend. ","This happened years ago and all the names are changed because, even though I don‚Äôt speak to these people anymore, I would like to keep it that way. Also, I am such a big fan and I literally cried when Charlotte announced her engagement, love you girl and when you post your wedding video on YouTube I will be ready with wine and popcorn and lots of tissues!!!

I 21(F) at the time, now 27, dropped out of a wedding party, here‚Äôs the tea. 

When I was in college, Amber 23(F), Tara 21(F), and I were close friends. We enjoyed having wine nights and girl time as girls do in college. 
The summer going into my junior year of college, Amber got engaged and asked me, Tara, and some other friends in our friend group to be her bridesmaids. I was beyond excited for her and I truly felt honored to be in her wedding party. I was and still am in love with weddings and all things love and romance. I was especially excited for Amber to pick out her wedding dress, I remember sending her pictures of beautiful wedding dresses she should try on and telling her how excited I was for her to say yes to the dress. I had never been a bridesmaid before and I was SO excited to see my friend get married. 

An important and unfortunate flaw I had in college- I had severe anxiety, I never slept, I was in a constant state of fight or flight, I quite literally never stopped studying and practicing (I studied music education). I even ended up in the ER at one point because I thought I was having a heart attack- nope just anxiety. All of this is to say that, unfortunately, when I get stressed, I shut down and I shut out almost everyone in my life. I basically disappeared during the spring of my junior year and had no awareness I was even doing so because I was so hyper focused on not being a failure in school. As a result, from January all the way until April of that year, I had unintentionally failed to reach out to Amber. But it is very important to note that Amber had also not reached out, called, or texted me once during those months either. But I didn‚Äôt even notice, I had no idea of how much time had passed since we last talked. I have a lot of friends that I may go a few months without talking to and when we talk again we are still besties. So I thought nothing of it. 

During the spring of my junior year, the week before a very important piano performance that I had and finals the week after, Tara asked me if I was available that Saturday for a girls wine night with myself, Tara, and Amber as we always had done. I told her, while I would love to go, I really couldn‚Äôt that weekend. I needed to practice and study for my upcoming performances and finals. 

Fast forward to Monday, I had just finished the piano performance I was stressed about when I saw Amber posted a picture of her with all of her bridesmaids except me holding a sign that read ‚ÄúI said yes to the dress.‚Äù  The way my heart dropped into my stomach when I saw that picture. Why hadn‚Äôt she told me? Why hadn‚Äôt she invited me? Why did Tara tell me it was just a girls wine night when really it was a whole girls day for Amber to pick out her wedding dress?!

I was so confused. I immediately called Amber. When she answered I told her that I saw her post. I told her congratulations for picking out the dress and I‚Äôm sure she looks so beautiful and that I couldn‚Äôt wait to see it and she said thank you. Then I asked her why I hadn‚Äôt been invited when all the other bridesmaids had been. She told me that she hadn‚Äôt heard from me since January and she didn‚Äôt think I was a good friend because I had been MIA. I apologized profusely and it took so much strength for me to not cry on the phone with her. I told her I was so so SO sorry for not reaching out to her the past few months, and that I am so excited for her wedding and I really value our friendship and it was nothing personal, I‚Äôve just been stressed about school. But she didn‚Äôt lighten up, she insisted that I was not a good bridesmaid or friend and if I was going to say no to a casual wine night then I didn‚Äôt deserve to help her pick out her dress. Basically, the whole thing was a plan and Tara was in on it too. They planned to ask me to the wine night as a test to see if I was worthy of helping her pick out the dress. I continued to apologize to her and I promised I would be a better friend. Her response was ‚Äúokay‚Äù but with a ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see if you can straighten up your act‚Äù kind of tone.  

That night was one of the worst nights of my time in college. I cried all night, literally soaked my pillow with tears, and called my sweet boyfriend Julian (now husband, who was long distance at the time) so many times throughout the night for comfort because I was so distraught. I was heartbroken and felt like I had been a terrible friend for not reaching out, but I also felt betrayed by Tara and Amber‚Äôs plan to ‚Äútest my friendship.‚Äù Like the guiding like he always is, Julian gently convinced me that I was NOT in the wrong and this whole thing was toxic. If Amber had texted me, I would have responded to her, if she had called me, I would have answered like I always had done. And if she had invited me to help her pick out her dress that weekend, I would have made the time to be there even though I was stressed. Maybe I didn‚Äôt have time for a careless wine night that weekend, but I did have time to be a bridesmaid, and if it was a wedding related activity, I would have made it a point to be there even if I was stressed and anxious.

That entire week was emotionally draining, I took it hard and it took me almost 2 months to fully process everything. I felt isolated and excluded from that friend group and the wedding party because they had all been there to help her pick out her dress, and I was intentionally excluded, and not one of the bridesmaids who were also my friends let me know or gave me a heads up that the whole thing was a trick. I finally started to find clarity about the situation. And my clarity was this- if I have to convince you that I‚Äôm a good friend, you don‚Äôt know me and we aren‚Äôt friends. I have good friends, I would go to the end of the world for them, and they know that. I don‚Äôt have to prove myself to them. And we definitely don‚Äôt lie and play games to see if the other is worthy. 

As much as I tried, I couldn‚Äôt get over this incident or be with the bride or bridesmaids knowing what they had done. In June of that year I dropped out of her wedding, I had to practice what I was going to say a million times with my mom before I talked to her. But I basically told her a true friend would never have wanted to make me feel the way she made me feel. If she wanted to talk to me, she could have texted me or called me, but she didn‚Äôt and then made me feel bad for doing the same thing! She was very upset with the news, the conversation was one of the hardest ones I have ever had, but I ended it proud because I stuck up for myself for the first time in my life. 

A few months later, she asked to meet for coffee and she apologized for her behavior. I forgave her but time had only solidified my decision to leave the group. I hope the best for her and everyone involved, just from far, far away.

All is not lost though, I have grown from this experience. I now make it a huge point to go to every friend and family function I can possibly go to and I take pride in always saying yes to plans, no matter how busy life may get. I intentionally answer the phone every time I get a call or text, even if I am stressed or anxious, and I try to remember to check in on my friends more often than before. But I know that my true friends know my heart, and got my back. ",8,1732381026.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

As always, if I fucked up in any way, get in the comments. I also made the choice to leave out anything that doesn't give us a clear idea of what is coming up content-wise for the game. As they say in the biz, your mileage may vary.

* Devs will continue to drop content at ""fairly regular cadence"" as opposed to commit to a fixed roadmap.
* Game performance will dictate the size and quantity of new systems and system changes.  They have a new team member/old coworker with AAA experience working on optimisation.
* New units are coming that may ""balance and unbalance"" combat scenarios. All factions have new units developed and in development, with devs considering a community vote to see which faction gets them first.
* AI path finding, behavioural routines, aggro and spawning are being improved, with new methods of unit deployment to be introduced. (think APCs, paratroopers.. maybe even drop ships?)
* Devs want AI spawns to be more immersive and to not ""get stuck"" but performance is a major limiter regarding how complex and realistic these systems will become. They have to strike a balance.
* Network improvements and ""backend features regarding communication"" are being worked on. (voice chat maybe? text chat improvements?)
* Weapon Repair is being worked on for a future update. Devs say ""sooner than you think"". They also say that RNG will be more involved in determining the condition of dropped weapons.
* Gun customisation improvements are coming as well as near-future weapon components to add to the existing library.
* Updated animations are ready with more being worked on, particularly for infantry. Animation improvements (involving **inverse kinematics**) will result in better interaction between units and the environment.
* New movement sets are being developed for existing player characters as well as new ones. (can we dive yet?) Also, new skins for scavs are in development that can be faction specific and earned through surviving multiple raids or specific involvement with/against a faction.
* Gunhead will be an offensive weapons platform with high carry strength, high HP and high aggro. Current healing items will be ineffective on Gunhead. (what, no booze?)
* Gunhead will showcase skill benefits that go beyond the current incremental improvements existing characters can gain. (read: most likely a skill to use the gun. on his head.)
* More meaningful map choices will tie the sector map closer to the state of the developing war. This will also involve unlocking more locations on the sector map.
* New aesthetics for existing environments are being worked on, in addition to new environments themselves.
* Faction behaviour will change as the war changes. factions will experience insurgencies and rogue operations (""civilian raids"") with and without player interference.
* Factions will also experience supply chain and conflict escalation issues that change their behaviour. Again, with or without player involvement. this may also be unit damage dependent.
* More Europan presence during Night Shift is planned, specifically involving high-survivability units with advanced tech eg. night vision. (so like.. EOD?)
* Devs may bring in a staff member in a future vid, who they have working specifically on Euruska, to talk about plans and upcoming features for that faction.
* More lore is being worked on for a future update. A video featuring mask man is coming containing information regarding the new water system. It is unclear whether it will be lore, mechanics or both.
* New systems are being worked on that will synergise with the water system but the devs are being tight-lipped about what they may be, so you get a bunch of hand-waving from me instead.
* It is suggested that we will get a content drop during the holidays, but they are not specifying ""which"" ..so it may be around New Year's rather than Christ Time(tm).

And finally, they're working on an art book and maybe a bigger coffee book but that's a whole 'nother dog & pony show and i'm not going to do their advertising for them. I hope this helps and have a glorious feast.",13,1732380810.0,TheForeverWinter,3,0.94,False

I have 3 friends who are basically the only people I talk to since I'm not very sociable, we're all in college. I'll call them Cindy, Mary and Mia

I was invited to Cindy's birthday and I met one of Cindy friend that I'll call Bella and  Cindy Mary and Bella all seem like great friends I mean she was invited to Cindy's birthday (it was a small gathering 8 peoples). Now I don't remember exactly how it all started but Bella started showing pictures to Cindy and Mary about what I think is her boyfriend. And one week ago while showing them pictures she slipped and Cindy saw a nude. Both Cindy and Mary were saying things like ""ew that's disgusting"" ""why do you have that"" things like that, which I can understand since it's a nude of a random guy that Cindy saw. There were other little things like when Bella texted both Cindy and Mary about the fact that her boyfriend spend the night and they both complained to Mia and me that it was disgusting or something like that. I wanted to tell them to say that they weren't comfortable with it but I didn't say anything since I felt like it was a small thing that I should let them get out of their system.

But what really bothered me and pushed me to make a post to ask help is the fact that 3 days ago Cindy and Mary told us in our group chat that Bella had a small crush on a girl in her class and that she said she wouldn't mind having a threesome. They started saying that it was disgusting and that  they didn't want to be associated with her which Mia also agreed too and it floored me because for me we were a bit in a silent agreement that Cindy and Mary were being ""a bit too bitchy about it but whatever they were our friends"". I didn't say anything and left them all on read ( it isn't uncommon since I only send a text 1 time every month lol).

 I tried to talk to Mia today since we go get coffee only the both of us in the morning and I felt like she was more approachable because she's a bit removed from the situation but I couldn't since her roommate came with us today. I don't really know how to feel since those are my only friend and Cindy and Mary are talking bad about one of their friend behind their back and what if they're doing the same with me? plus the thing with the threesome was said in confidence and here they are telling me and Mia about it. I told them personal things that happened with my parents so I'm questioning if they talked about it behind my back .

 There's also the fact that they find a threesome disgusting and I'm not ready to touch that because even if I'm not interested in having a threesome now what if one day I'm thinking about it and need a second opinion can I even ask them? Or will it be turned into a gossip joke between them ? I particularly feel betrayed by Mia too because she agreed and while I know that it's dumb to feel more betrayed about Mia since she technically did less I do because we're both a bit of unsocial and reserved so I like her a touch more and felt more close to her. 
If someone know how to address it because they're already moving on like it's not a big deal and for me it is.",1,1732380536.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

Picture this: Albert Einstein, arguably one of the greatest minds in history, sits back, strokes his mustache, and proclaims, **‚ÄúCompound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.‚Äù** A bold statement, but coming from the guy who figured out relativity, it‚Äôs worth taking seriously. Compound interest is a superpower hiding in plain sight, quietly making early investors millionaires, turning pocket change into fortunes, and fueling your daydreams of early retirement.

But here‚Äôs a twist. What if we pair this age-old financial marvel with a modern technological disruptor‚ÄîBitcoin? Now imagine accepting Bitcoin payments easily with our **Bitcoin Payment Button app** (hint: it‚Äôs simpler than making a TikTok dance video). Let‚Äôs dive into why this is a match made in financial heaven and how you can ride this compound interest train to the moon (and maybe even Mars).

# What Exactly Is Compound Interest?

Compound interest is the art of earning interest on your interest. Think of it as a snowball rolling downhill, gathering more snow with each turn. The longer it rolls, the bigger it grows, eventually turning into an unstoppable avalanche of wealth.

Here‚Äôs a quick example:

* Start with $100 earning 10% interest annually.
* After the first year, you‚Äôve got $110.
* By year two, you‚Äôre earning interest on $110, not just your original $100.
* Fast forward 10 years? You‚Äôve doubled your money. Fast forward 20 years? Your money has quadrupled.

Now imagine applying this concept to Bitcoin‚Äîan asset that, over the years, has seen mind-boggling returns. Pair compound interest with Bitcoin‚Äôs growth potential, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for financial wizardry.

# Bitcoin + Compound Interest = Explosive Potential

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just digital gold; it‚Äôs a wealth-generating powerhouse. Over the last decade, Bitcoin has gone from being worth pennies to tens of thousands of dollars per coin. While traditional investments like stocks or savings accounts grow at a modest pace, Bitcoin's meteoric rise has been rewriting the rules of the game.

Let‚Äôs do a little thought experiment. What if you had accepted Bitcoin payments for your side hustle five years ago? Imagine accumulating a stash of Bitcoin and letting its value multiply through both market appreciation and strategic reinvestment. That‚Äôs the power of compounding in action! And guess what? You can still start today with ease, using our **Bitcoin Payment Button app**.

# Enter the Bitcoin Payment Button: Your Gateway to Easy Bitcoin Earnings

Our **Bitcoin Payment Button app** is the ultimate tool for businesses, creators, and entrepreneurs who want to embrace the Bitcoin revolution. Whether you‚Äôre running a coffee shop, selling art online, or offering freelance services, this app makes accepting Bitcoin payments a breeze.

# Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Set It Up**: Integrate the button on your website or platform in just a few clicks.
2. **Start Accepting Payments**: Customers pay in Bitcoin, and you receive payments instantly‚Äîno middlemen, no fuss.
3. **Let the Magic Begin**: Hold onto your Bitcoin, watch it grow, and enjoy the compound interest effect.

Seriously, it‚Äôs like planting a Bitcoin tree that grows digital coins over time. And unlike traditional payment methods, you won‚Äôt lose a chunk of your earnings to high transaction fees or chargebacks.

# How Compound Interest Meets Bitcoin Payments in Real Life

# Scenario 1: The Freelancer‚Äôs Dream

You‚Äôre a graphic designer earning $50 per project. You integrate our Bitcoin Payment Button and start accepting payments in Bitcoin. Over time, those Bitcoin payments grow in value thanks to the market and compound interest. A few years later, that $50 you earned could be worth hundreds‚Äîor even thousands. Your portfolio isn‚Äôt just creative‚Äîit‚Äôs profitable.

# Scenario 2: The Small Business Power Play

Imagine owning a cozy caf√© that accepts Bitcoin payments. Each payment you receive gets reinvested into your Bitcoin wallet, where compound interest does its thing. Soon, your caf√© isn‚Äôt just serving lattes; it‚Äôs brewing up a financial empire.

# The Compound Interest Formula, Simplified

For those who love numbers, here‚Äôs the magic formula:  
**A = P(1 +** r/n**)\^(nt)**

Where:

* **A** = the future value of your investment/earnings
* **P** = the principal amount (initial deposit or payment)
* **r** = the annual interest rate (in decimal form)
* **n** = number of times interest is compounded per year
* **t** = time in years

Don‚Äôt worry if math isn‚Äôt your thing. The bottom line is this: the longer your Bitcoin sits and compounds, the more it grows.

# Why Accept Bitcoin Payments?

1. **Global Reach**: Bitcoin knows no borders. Your customers could be in Tokyo, Toronto, or Timbuktu, and they can still pay you instantly.
2. **Lower Fees**: Traditional payment processors take a hefty cut. Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt.
3. **Future-Proof**: With more people adopting cryptocurrency every day, you‚Äôre positioning your business for long-term success.
4. **Passive Wealth Creation**: Every Bitcoin payment you accept is like planting a seed. Let it sit, let it grow, and let compound interest do the rest.

# Einstein Was Right: Compound Interest Is Magical

Einstein may not have envisioned Bitcoin, but he‚Äôd certainly be impressed by its synergy with compound interest. When you accept Bitcoin payments using our **Bitcoin Payment Button app**, you‚Äôre not just earning‚Äîyou‚Äôre creating a future where your wealth works for you, compounding and growing while you sleep.

# Ready to Join the Bitcoin Revolution?

Compound interest might be the eighth wonder of the world, but combining it with Bitcoin payments is the financial equivalent of discovering Atlantis. It‚Äôs a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to grow your wealth exponentially, and it starts with one simple step: integrating our **Bitcoin Payment Button app** into your business.

[Don‚Äôt wait‚Äîclick here to start your journey today!](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/payment-button/)

1gy3lxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gy3lxd/why_dating_scares_me_because_of_my_past/,Why dating scares me because of my past relationship. ,"I'm a 27-year-old guy, and I've been riding the single wave for about a year now. While there have been a few flings scattered throughout this time, nothing really stuck for longer than a couple of months. Back in late 2021, I matched with someone on Tinder who caught my attention like no one else ever had. After months of texting, we finally met in June 2022, and it was magic. We instantly clicked in a way that left me breathless.

She was stunning‚Äîlong brown hair cascading down her shoulders, captivating hazel eyes that sparkled with kindness, and a physique that clearly showed she took care of herself. It made sense when she mentioned having some modeling experience. But beyond her striking looks, what drew me in even more was her warmth and genuine nature. I felt I could lean on her for anything, especially in those early days when she went out of her way to do sweet things that had me wondering if I had found the one.

I fell head over heels. I planned romantic vacations, surprising outings, and showered her with gifts and flowers because she deserved nothing less. But as the months passed, cracks began to surface, and I chose to ignore the warning signs. She shared stories about her tumultuous past, relationships that ended in flames, and friends turned enemies. One tale in particular struck me. She painted a picture of a past argument gone wrong, claiming she merely pushed her ex against a wall. But later, her brother revealed the truth: it was far more violent than she let on, and she actually stabbed this guy with a screwdriver. I had been oblivious, believing her lies throughout our entire relationship.

There were other red flags, too. She had moved in with an ex's family after their breakup, staying there while dating others. It felt like there was a cycle of instability surrounding her‚Äîshe was adopted and appeared to carry heavy abandonment issues, despite her family seemingly being decent people. When she faced sudden homelessness, I stepped up and offered her a place to stay with my family. That‚Äôs when things really started to unravel.

Suddenly, the relationship that felt so perfect began to morph. We fought over trivial things, and she became increasingly distant. I wanted to be supportive, so I listened, trying to help with her job woes and what seemed to be a general dissatisfaction in life. I thought love meant sacrifice, so I took on extra chores, kept up with the bills, and bought her favorite flowers‚Äîyellow roses‚Äîhoping to rekindle what we once had. But my efforts felt like they were pushing her further away.

Eventually, we moved into our own apartment together. For a brief moment, it felt like the beginning again, but soon enough, the same issues resurfaced. A single error‚Äîforgetting to grab my own hairbrush while grocery shopping‚Äîtriggered an explosion of anger. She accused me of making her feel like my mother instead of my girlfriend. Despite my trying to do everything right, the distance between us grew.

Then, one day, she dropped a bombshell‚ÄîI could hardly believe it when she said she wanted to drop the ‚Äúboyfriend and girlfriend‚Äù label. My heart sank when she told me she was ‚Äútrying to fall in love with me again.‚Äù It felt like we were back in the uncertain dating phase, though we shared a home.

I desperately sought to repair the connection. Each time I felt things improving, they would quickly slide back into turmoil. In retrospect, my attempts to cling only led to her losing respect for me. I never set boundaries, which allowed her to dismiss my feelings time and again. Her birthday approached, and I wanted to make it unforgettable. I planned a heartfelt dinner at her favorite restaurant, bought the Louis Vuitton boots she had been eyeing along with some stylish Gym Shark workout gear, and whipped up her favorite cake. I poured my heart into a card, hoping to remind her that despite the challenges, I still believed in us. As she carefully unfolded the card, a brilliant smile spread across her face, and she exclaimed how sweet it was. The joy in her eyes as she admired the gifts was truly contagious. Interestingly, she never uttered a simple ""thank you,"" but in that moment, it barely registered with me. Just then, she dropped a surprising bombshell: instead of our long-anticipated dinner, a friend had invited her out that same evening. After she canceled our plans, I finally reached my breaking point. I packed a bag and headed to my parents‚Äô house, needing some space to gather my thoughts. I had told her we needed to have a serious conversation because I was feeling unhappy, and to my surprise, she agreed. 

The next day, I returned home, hoping for some clarity, but instead, I found an empty apartment. The only things left were my belongings, a heartfelt card I had written for her, and her half-eaten birthday cake sitting forlornly on the counter. It felt like a punch to the gut, and I dropped to my knees, overwhelmed by the devastation of it all. I tried reaching out to her, but she had blocked me everywhere. It was, without a doubt, the worst heartbreak I had ever experienced. 

Looking back, my biggest regret is that I didn‚Äôt set clear boundaries sooner or advocate for myself more. Over time, she lost respect for me and treated me accordingly, which chipped away at my self-confidence throughout our relationship. 

Fast forward to today, and I can honestly say I‚Äôm better off without her. I‚Äôve reclaimed my confidence and found passion in my work as a firefighter in my city. In fact, I‚Äôm in the best physical and mental shape I‚Äôve ever been in. 

Then one morning, after a grueling 24-hour shift, I walked into Starbucks for my usual coffee fix‚Äîand there she was, working as a barista. I couldn‚Äôt help but recall how she used to brag about her exes ending up worse off once she left them, but here I was, clearly thriving. The shock on her face when she saw me in my firefighter uniform was priceless, like she had seen a ghost. Our interaction was brief; she barely looked up as I placed my order and walked out, coffee in hand and my head held high. I felt a sense of closure wash over me. 

Still, the scars from that relationship linger, and I find myself wary of diving into another one. I‚Äôve always been a hopeless romantic, eager to do anything to make my partner happy‚Äîeven at the cost of my own happiness. But I‚Äôve learned that the next time I enter a relationship, I have to establish boundaries‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve struggled with in the past. With this newfound confidence, I‚Äôm hopeful that I can finally stand up for myself and create a healthier dynamic.",2,1732379587.0,dating,2,0.75,False

Yes, Finnally did it.  
Thought about maybe going to 173 but than just, I couldn't anymore, Gut was grumbly since yesterday, couldn't sleep longer than 5 hours, so I said that's it.  
Well,   
broke it about two hours ago with two Tea Spoons of Native Olive Oil, wich I'll for sure replace with the same amount of Ghee next time, since it was a bit scratchy in the throat.  
Now I'm slowly eating a little bowl of Sauerkraut and drinking some Herbal Tea Blend (No Suger nor Honey), feeling a bit... Sleepy.   
Also a bit hot headed for some reason, anyone else got  that too?  
Besides that,   
First 72 hours were not so pleasent, post 96 was like Stoned and Hyperactive, have been acting like I drunk 5 Redbull and 3Cups of Coffee, haha, felt Great tho!   
Gonna Probably eat after that little Sauerkraut Bowl in 2 hours or so and let the Gut adjust and than have some Boiled Veggies (Carrots, Collie Flower) and some Fish Oil Pill.   
Maybe some Kefir inbetween after that and maybe aegg with som of the before too, and later some Tuna.   
Overall,   
Hope it all adjusts right on the Bactteria Spectrum down there since I'mdoing this Fast not to lose weight but to Heal My Leaky Gut wich has been Troubling Me for over a Decade.

1gy3klc,https://www.reddit.com/r/fearofflying/comments/1gy3klc/this_is_your_captain_speaking_we_are_going_to/,"This is your Captain Speaking, we are going to encounter some turbulence‚Ä¶..","Credit to Alexi Kessler from Explore.

If turbulence has you feeling anxious during air travel, know that science is on your side. Despite turbulence sometimes being a bit scary for passengers, it's actually not as dangerous as one might think. Turbulence occurs when air masses collide and cause an uneven flow of air over the wings of an aircraft. This can cause the plane to suddenly lose altitude at times and create some shuddering and turbulence in the cabin. However, even in severe weather, turbulence will not cause a plane to crash.¬†

The main thing that makes turbulence dangerous is when items in the cabin are left unsecured or when people leave their seats during turbulence or unbuckle their seatbelts. This is why bags are placed in secure overhead bins or under seats and why seatbelt signs are turned on when the plane hits some turbulence. Thanks to amazing flight attendants, these rules are usually followed to a T to keep passengers safe.

Even with turbulence, air travel is still the safest option

Unfortunately, turbulence just goes hand-in-hand with air travel, especially if you're a frequent flyer. Almost every time you fly, you'll feel a bit of shuddering and shaking. But this is why it's good to familiarize yourself with what causes it and why air travel is still the safest form of travel! First, turbulence has not caused an airplane to crash for over 50 years. So, the chances of you being on the first plane to do so in almost half a century are slim to none. This is because commercial planes are built to withstand extreme forces and airplane wings can bend to an enormous degree and continue to fly safely.¬†

The construction of airplanes, the stress testing they undergo, and the thousands and thousands of flight hours pilots put in have massively improved safety standards and led to air travel becoming one of the safest forms of transportation. According to David Ropeik, an Instructor in Risk Communication at the Harvard School of Public Health, you have a 1 in 5,000 chance of being in a fatal car accident on any given day but a 1 in 11 million chance of being in a fatal plane crash! Okay, maybe that statistic doesn't make you feel great about driving, but it should assuage any fears you might when you feel your seat shake. If you want to reduce the amount of turbulence you feel though, you'll want to sit towards the middle of the plane over the wings or get a seat in the back which is statistically the safest place to be in the event of a crash. (RG80 Take: I disagree with this.  To feel less Turbulence sit over wing or as close to the front as you can.  The Center of Gravity is over the wing‚Ä¶but technically yes, the safest place in a plane is in the tail.  Thanks mythbusters)

Here's what pilots and flight attendants have to say

 
If the numbers aren't enough to convince you, you should hear it straight from the experts themselves. Here is some insight from Charlie Page, a Senior First Officer¬†with over 10,000 hours of worldwide flying experience. Charlie writes that the safety of the passengers is the flight crew's number one priority. Keeping everyone on board calm during turbulence is also key to a pleasant flight. So, when they have advanced notice of turbulence, pilots will let the cabin crew know that at a certain time in the flight, to expect some bumps. Additionally, pilots will communicate over a special frequency to keep other pilots in the area informed about turbulence so they can prepare.¬†

Further, when there is turbulence, yes, the plane can drop in altitude but Charlie writes that the altimeter (the instrument which records a plane's altitude) typically shows this merely a few feet. What's their biggest concern during turbulence? Keeping their cup of coffee from spilling! On the other hand, some flight attendants say they actually love turbulence as it gives them a chance to get off their feet and rest for a bit. Sounds like they're really not all that concerned about a little bad weather.

# Investment Value

At $499 (when I purchased), the Explorer 500 has proven to be a worthy investment. The peace of mind alone during the power outage justified the cost.

# Final Thoughts üí≠

If you're on the fence about the Explorer 500, consider your primary use case:

* Need more power? Look at the Explorer 1000
* Want lighter? Check the Explorer 300
* Need USB-C? Consider the Goal Zero Yeti

But if you want a reliable, well-balanced power station that hits the sweet spot between capacity and portability, the Explorer 500 is hard to beat.

He just asked about my past relationships and nothing else. He was just talking about himself, we then went to eat Gelato and then he gets a call and says his sister is calling him and just left. Like literally just left, no apology no offer of leaving me to my place, nothing .

I still haven't received any message from him, Am I over expecting from him because I feel really hurt about today's date. Should I cut off ?",34,1732379022.0,IndianBoysOnTinder,53,0.97,False

The best results are achieved using freshly ground coffee and the right grind setting. A single shot of espresso is made from approximately¬†**7**\-**10 grams**¬†of ground coffee and takes approximately 25 seconds to brew.

The problem with a single shot is the puck screen won't be low enough to fit into the brew head, and without the screen, grounds touch the brew head, and it becomes a maintenance move that is one move over the line for me. So I use a double-shot pressurized cup with 14 grams of beans, and grind setting of #10, for a perfect crema double shot. 

For a double shot latte base, I use 16.5 grams of beans ground on #10 setting in a single wall basket, and always a puck screen. Keeps the brew head clean. I also leave the portafilter installed after brewing, so the coffee puck shrinks when cooled. The coffee puck easily releases from the basket. Clogging the double-wall basket's tiny discharge hole? If so, I gather up my three extra double wall baskets and soak them in a single-tablet descaler bath which cleans the oils and coffee residue out, rinse in a clean water bath, and let dry.",1,1732378883.0,u_AccurateSmell5499,0,1.0,False
1gy3c31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1gy3c31/which_island_should_i_visit_in_hawaii/,Which Island Should I Visit In Hawaii?,"Hey there fellow travelers! 

I just got back from an incredible Hawaiian adventure, and I can't wait to share my insights about choosing the perfect Hawaiian island for your next vacation. After exploring multiple islands and trying out various activities, I've put together this guide to help you make the best choice.

Maui - The Romantic Choice
If you're planning a honeymoon or couples getaway, Maui is your spot. The Road to Hana, with its stunning waterfalls and black sand beaches, is breathtaking. I spent sunrise at Haleakala Volcano, and it was mind-blowing! The whale watching tours (during winter months) are incredible too.

Oahu - The Vibrant Mix
Want a blend of city life and paradise? Oahu's your answer. Waikiki Beach is always buzzing with energy, and the North Shore has the best surfing spots I've ever seen. Pearl Harbor gives you a dose of history, while the local food scene in Honolulu is absolutely amazing.

Big Island - The Adventure Seeker's Paradise
This island blew my mind with its diversity. Where else can you see active volcanoes, go snorkeling in crystal-clear waters, and visit coffee farms all in one day? I booked some fantastic tours through https://athometouch.com/hawaii and saved quite a bit with their rewards program.

Kauai - The Nature Lover's Dream
Called the Garden Isle for good reason, Kauai is perfect if you want to escape crowds. The Napali Coast literally made my jaw drop, and Waimea Canyon is like a tropical Grand Canyon. The hiking trails here are unreal!

Lanai - The Luxury Escape
Looking for something more exclusive? Lanai offers high-end resorts and secluded beaches. It's perfect if you want to really get away from it all.

Pro Tips From My Experience:
- Island hopping is totally worth it if you have time
- Each island has its own vibe and weather patterns
- Book activities in advance (especially during peak season)
- Don't try to do everything - pick your must-dos and relax

I found some amazing deals on activities and tours at https://athometouch.com/hawaii. They have this cool rewards program where you earn money back for future bookings, which helped me explore more islands than I initially planned.

Remember, there's no wrong choice - each island is paradise in its own way. It really comes down to what kind of experience you're after. Whether you're seeking adventure, relaxation, or a bit of both, Hawaii's got you covered.

What's your take on the Hawaiian islands? Have you visited any of them? I'd love to hear about your experiences or answer any questions you might have about planning your trip!",1,1732378880.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 13 weeks pp, and I‚Äôm feeling like I have zero time to do anything for me. I‚Äôve recently returned to work and my days look like the following: wake up, throw on clothes, quickly fix hair/wash face, nurse, leave for work, eat breakfast and drink coffee on the way, work and take my three pump breaks, return home, nurse, clean pump parts while my husband starts dinner, hang out with baby, eat dinner, nurse, put baby to bed, shower, watch 30 minutes of TV with my husband, pack up everything I need for the next day and then go to bed. Baby is also waking up 1x each night to nurse, so I‚Äôm still not getting uninterrupted sleep.

My husband has been great through all of this. He gets baby ready, asks me what he can do to help before I leave for the office each day, makes me coffee and does so many chores.

However, I‚Äôm exhausted, feel like I‚Äôm barely put together and feel like I have zero time for the things I previously enjoyed such as exercise and cooking. Prior to having a baby, I was known at work for being calm, cool and collected, and I know I have been the complete opposite of that this past week. I know I‚Äôm still early into the working mom journey, but any ideas and encouragement would be appreciated. ",1,1732378577.0,workingmoms,1,1.0,False
1gy37ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbsschool/comments/1gy37ia/cf_insight/,CF insight,"Hello everyone. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes their time to read and/or respond to this post. 

I have been interested in pursuing the full time CF program at NBSS for a few years now. I have had the chance to speak to a couple of graduates in the past, but I‚Äôm hoping to speak to some more, and more in depth, before I fully commit to this decision. 

I have been working in the trades for well over a decade now. Mostly in the landscape field, with a focus on fine gardening and hardscape design/installation in Cambridge, MA. For the past two years I have been working as a carpenter on a foundation to finish large addition project in the metrowest area. 

I am now again thinking of the future and NBSS is filling a lot of my head space. I feel like this is a better time than any to take this leap, if I am ever going to, but I still would love to talk to some students or graduates about the realities of the program and life after. 

If anyone is willing to offer some insight, either here or in person over a cup of coffee (my treat, of course), I would be very grateful. Thanks much!",1,1732378551.0,nbsschool,0,1.0,False
