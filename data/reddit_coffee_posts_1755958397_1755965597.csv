My name is Yl'Tharii, a polyp'ian and a member of the Galactic Council that has ruled the galaxy (which humans still call the Milky Way) for Earth-millennia.



In my previous entry, I have covered the members of the High Ten, the ten strongest races in the known galaxy. For this particular codex entry, I shall mainly cover humans and some their closest allies. I should mention that humans are, as of the present time, also on good terms with certain members of the High Ten including avia-nites, kap'poids and tauro-nites.



Now, without further ado, let us proceed to the main content of this codex.

Humans

\------



Home World	: Earth (Near-death world)

Average Height	: 1.5 to 1.8 Earth-metres tall

Psychic Ability	: None

Lifespan	: Up to eighty Earth-years (possibly longer)

War Mantra	: ""We are the hammer! We are the hate! We are the doom of our foes!""



Notable Biological Features:

\----------------------------

In terms of physical features, humans are sapient mammalian-type beings. Each human has a head, two arms and two legs which are all connected to a singular torso that contains many vital internal organs such as the heart and lungs. A human head has vital organs too including a brain, a mouth, a nose with two nostrils, two eyes and two ears. Like many mammalian-type beings, humans possess hair though it mostly grows on the top of their heads and, for many males, parts of their face. The hands at the end of their arms, while lacking in sharp claws or brute strength, possess good dexterity which is useful for not only making and using tools but also, to the dismay of at least one prideful race that resemble cats from Earth, the felinors, giving excellent ""scritches"" (each hand has five digits, including one opposable thumb digit). Similarly, their legs do not grant them great speed or excellent footing but humans are infamous for being able to maintain a steady walking or jogging pace longer than most animals on their home world (as well as many other races throughout the for that matter). As for their feet, each foot has five digits. Their skin, while soft and vulnerable to damage, can produce cooling sweat to expel excess body heat and store excess calories in the form of fat which also serves an insulating function (many humans dislike being called fat though). As for structural support, humans possess an internal calcium-based skeleton.



In terms of diet, humans are omnivores and are uniquely capable and/or willing to consume a wide variety of substances that other races tend to avoid to the point of being justifiably dubbed as a race with ""exceedingly omnivorous palates"". The substances they can consume include ethanol, caffeine, capsaicin and menthol. In spite of their incredible tolerance to the said substances, even they can suffer toxicity from overconsumption.



Humans have distinct male and female sexes with males possessing broader shoulders and females possessing both wider hips and breasts for breastfeeding infants. Females normally produce one offspring at a time but there have been times when females produce two or even more.



Notable Facts:

\--------------

Although humans are one of the newer races to have been accepted by the Galactic Council, they have quickly gained a rather infamous reputation as the ""orcs of the galaxy"", a rather derogative title based on a certain race of brutish sapient beings from various works of human fiction known as 'orcs'. As for why humans are often deemed as such by other races, especially ones who fear or dislike them, well, there are a number of reasons.



One of the reasons why humans are considered as comparable to the fictional brutish orcs is their unusually oxymoronic natures. To quote a statement from a certain human friend of mine named Michael Bakers, ""We're pretty much 'anything goes' on the whole damn personality spectrum including the good, the bad and the dumbass."" This unusual ""racial flexibility"" (or ""racial instability"" depending on whom you are asking) in thinking and feeling offers both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it puts humans at risk of suffering from internal mental and emotional conflict which may ultimately lead to dysphoria, depression and even madness. In addition, the highly varied mentality of humanity has led to a lot of bitter conflicts between fellow humans to the point of waging open war against one another (something which fictional orcs are indeed known to do). On the other hand, humans possess arguably the greatest potential for creativity in the whole galaxy when it comes to various topics such as art, making fictional scenarios and improvising with available technology because two individual humans can have completely different cognitive processes when trying to solve the same problem. In contrast, most members of any one race share similar patterns of thoughts and emotions with relatively minor variations of the same ""baseline personality template"" (which is not always a good thing).



Speaking of improvising with available technology, many humans have a distinct preference for flexibility and customization with their machines. That is not to say that they do not value optimization at all but they would rather have machines that can do many different things at acceptable levels of efficiency than to make something perfectly optimized for a singular function at the expense of making it incapable of doing anything else unless necessary. This line of logic makes sense to a degree as an unexpected twist of events is less likely to result in complete disaster if one's equipment is able to ""switch gears"" to rapidly adapt to the change in situation. However, it can also be reasonably argued that humans have a rather excessive love for ""slapping random stuff together"" to see if the resulting contraption can somehow work (a trait that even I am willing to admit is rather ""orky""). In fact, after receiving the blessings of technology from the Galactic Council, humans have modified, retrofitted and repurposed them to a degree that surprised even the High Ten of the council.



Some notable examples of human inventions include:



\---------

'Anti-Pest Laser Defence Position', which is essentially an upgrade of an already-present human invention, is a type of laser defence system that eliminates pests, especially flying ones, within a limited range. Initially dismissed as both excessive and impractical with a significant chance of causing unintended collateral damage to both non-target animals and even the users themselves, it has proven its worth in controlling pest population in both near-death worlds and death worlds that have a lot of dangerous flying pests.



'Training shields' which are modified physical-type shields that offer surprisingly effective resistance training. Depending on the settings, the feeling of trying to move while under the effects of a training shield can be compared to trying to walk through water or wet mud. Due to its speed-reactive nature, humans have nicknamed them 'oobleck training shields' after a certain material called oobleck.



'Capturing shields' which are modified hybrid-type shields that can be used to capture criminals and even small vehicles such as a fighter-class starship. Depending on the exact capturing mechanism, humans have nicknamed them 'capturing bubble shields' or 'capturing freeze shields'.



'Hard-light weapons' which are modified hybrid-type shields which are in the shape of a variety of melee weapons such as swords and hammers that weigh almost nothing yet are durable enough to cut, pierce of smash through a wide variety of materials. The hard-light weapons can even be modified to function like saws, as in the case of humanity's infamous hard-light chain-swords, or release bursts of destructive energy.



'Psychic stealth devices' which are psychic devices that can actually conceal an individual's psychic presence from detection by psychic races. This is achieved by suppressing psychic abilities enough to conceal the psychic presence of the users as nothing more than ""background psychic noise"", a difficult process which can only be achieved with the use of a high-performance artificial intelligence that constantly monitors and calibrates the ""psychic stealth field"" by the second. It should be noted that this device was actually first invented by a faction that belonged to an especially influential human cartel trader and has yet to be fully reverse-engineered due to a distinct lack of collected data or samples.



Various vehicles and mechs which can transform into alternate forms such as a tank that can transform into a stationary artillery canon for long-range bombardment. Another example is a tank-like battle mech with six spider-like legs that can transform into a stable stationary turret with its power supply more fully devoted to protective energy shields and destructive energy weapons. Arguably the most notable example of their transforming vehicles and mechs are the 'cyberclone mechs' which are humanoid mechs that can transform into a vehicle (usually a fighter-class starship). Cyberclone mechs can transform into functional vehicles thanks to the use of not only 'kibble gear' which form part of their alternate forms, weapons included, but also the strategic use of speed-reactive shields that help to reduce drag when moving at high speeds and protect vulnerable points.

\---------



As stated previously, humans are unusually varied in their way of thinking to the point that it is often safer to assume that no two humans truly think alike. However, there are a few things that one can generally expect from a human regardless of mentality. One of them is that many humans like good food and drink which, admittedly, is easy for just about anyone to understand even if it is difficult to comprehend their dietary preferences such as ""drinking enough coffee to poison a massive apex predator"". Another thing which many humans share is a love for things that they find attractive, especially things that are cute or ""friend-shaped"". In fact, the quickest way to become the target of a human's undivided fury is to harm anything that they deem as cute or ""friend-shaped"" within their vicinity. While the desire to protect someone or something that is deemed as precious is understandable, the willingness to choose violence as the first option has done little to disprove the opinion that humans are barbaric like fictional orcs. The third thing that many humans share, which is also arguably the most aggravating of all in my opinion, is the desire to do ""awesome shit"" such as making random things explode, literally. As a matter of fact, a lot of the technological leaps that humans have somehow succeeded in achieving in such a short amount of time can be boiled down to humans wanting to get their hands on ""cool toys that they can do awesome shit with"".



There is a reason why humans are widely considered as crazy especially when it comes to food and things that they consider as cute or awesome.



Culture-wise, humans are the biggest producers of fictional works in the known galaxy which range for absolutely awful to being amazing enough to impress even the likes of the prideful el-varans, the elf-like members of the High Ten in the Galactic Council. They have also used donated technology to improve various forms of entertainment such as transforming robotic toys (which were actually built around technology provided by another member of the High Ten, the technologically-advanced insectoid cy-brids) and psychic control devices that allow users to enter a digital game world.



In terms of combat capabilities, humans are certainly not the fastest, strongest or smartest race in the galaxy. That being said, they are infamously good at persevering against even seemingly impossible odds (a trait that many believe is linked to their origins as social persistence hunters). Humans are also infamously good at coming up with combat strategies that range from brilliant to stupid to, somehow, both. Their machines of war (including powered armour, mechs and vehicles) are by no means the most advanced in the galaxy but they are exceptionally flexible and easy to both customise and improvise even while in the middle of a battle thanks to the widespread usage of interchangeable components. What is arguably most notable however is their brutal war tactics which has caused some races to consider human soldiers as members of a hate-filled death cult that has already influenced a number of allied races. While the accusation is not completely baseless, since humans in powered armour have been known to perform brutal ""glory kills"" and chant 'war mantras' to demoralise their enemies, one would do well to remember one war mantra that all humans and their allies share: ""FOR ALL THAT WE CHERISH, LIVE WITH HONOUR, FIGHT WITH COURAGE AND DIE IN GLORY!""

Couple additives to help : 

Top kin: I also would have thrown Shouto Todoroki or Zuko Atla in because…. Father issues 😐

Music: I don’t have specific bands or artists that I like. I like certain songs and that’s about as invested as I get with a particular artist.

Food: coffee is food. Fight me.

As for favorite movie: I’d do the entire Hobbit&LOTR series but that’s a series not a movie so.

1my5g99,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1my5g99,I created a List of TV Shows Related to Chinese Food,"Chinese cuisine is one of the richest, most diverse food cultures in the world and when it shows up on TV, it’s often *so much more* than just a meal. Whether it's about tradition, family, or street food flair, Chinese food brings emotion, history, and flavor to the screen in unforgettable ways.

So I decided to create a list of **TV shows (Chinese dramas, and food series)** that truly highlight the depth, diversity, and culture behind Chinese cuisine from traditional recipes passed down generations to modern fusion experiments in street food stalls.

These shows don’t just make you hungry, they make you feel something. They connect food with identity, memory, community, and often, healing.

**🔥 A few standout shows on the list:**

* *Flavorful Origins*
* *A Bite of China*
* *Midnight Diner (China)*
* *Chinese Restaurant* (Reality series)
* And more hidden gems that deserve your watchlist!

***I curated this list for anyone who loves food storytelling, with a rich Chinese flavor twist.***

Till now, four boys have come to see me. I had talked with all of them, and surprisingly, all of them had serious relationships in the past. It’s not like I am against it. One boy even said he had a sexual relationship with his girlfriend. He just wanted to be clear on his side, I presume. I rejected all of them for personal reasons. My parents are still receiving inquiries for arranged marriage.

My point is, it feels like everybody had some kind of sexual relationship in the past. Most of the boys have lost their virginity before marriage with some other girl. Even in my friend circle, there isn’t a single male who is a virgin. I had one boyfriend in school. We parted our way after 10th. I had another one in college. I had my first kiss with him, but he cheated on me after a while. Just around this time, my cousin had an affair with some girl and he ran away with her. It actually put the entire family under stress and tension. My parents became more strict. I got into a job and all, and never entertained the idea of having a boyfriend.

About my best friend, we were interns at the same company. He left the company after two years. I left the company after a while. We were both working in different companies. We kept in touch via social media and all. He changed company again with a good package . I applied in the same company through his reference and joined his team. So we are kind of together for the last six to seven years.

When we were interns, he casually asked me to go out to a restaurant. I rejected the idea due to college experiences and family. But we have been best friends. I know about his girlfriend and also know he had FWB with some girl.

It’s easy to talk about almost everything with him. I went to his apartment today morning. We had nice coffee, a good chat and all. I put down my point about having sex before marriage with him. He was a little bit surprised. I thought he would say yes. But rather, he asked me to think more carefully if I really want this. We might catch up feelings as we are already best friends for a long time, and also he had a crush on me in the beginning. Also, he asked me why this thing all of a sudden when I was single until now. I didn’t want to tell him about parents and my cousin and all. So I simply told him I feel FOMO and don’t want to miss out. His expression was confusing. He said if that is what I want, he agrees. He has been single for quite a while now. He walked me to the door and we had a hug. But it was different. We usually do a friend hug, hand wrap, tap tap and that’s all. But the first time, he held my waist and my hands were on his shoulder. We had a long hug. It felt so much different, being so close to someone.

Coming back home, I am thinking more and more about him and what he said. He isn’t just a best friend. I always liked him and he is very close to me. I can discuss anything with him. I would have happily dated him if I wasn’t so much of a coward. I am just confused. What if I catch feelings for him? And I don’t want to do this with anyone else.

I’m currently dogsitting for four labrador retrievers for a family in an affluent neighborhood in NC, USA. I typically charge $100 per overnight for one dog, and then add $50 per additional dog per overnight. for daily check ins, i charge $20 per hour of time with the dogs. With four dogs this comes out to $250 per overnight. The dogs have an incredibly strict schedule (like little soldiers as my boyfriend lovingly puts it), needing to be fed at 7am, 12pm, 3:30pm, two 2 mile walks at 7:30am and 4pm, and then bedtime at 7pm. 

this takes up nearly my entire day, as the amount of time between these hours is so limited I can’t really do much else besides leave for a quick errand or getting food. getting schoolwork done (i’m a student) is a whole other issue, I can’t leave for long enough to be productive at a library or coffee shop. if i try to work at their house, the dogs bark and paw at me every 15-30 minutes for attention. today their owner recommended giving them a stimulation toy to calm them down, that only worked for 30 minutes before they were back to bugging me. 

i need some advice… should i give up the gig because it’s getting too taxing on my own schedule? should i increase my rates to compensate? i know the family has a hard time keeping dog sitters because of how demanding their dogs’ schedule is. they are incredibly sweet dogs, it’s just so. much. work.",1,1755965221.0,petsitting,0,1.0,False

I think she may be a mixed Norwegian forest cat or perhaps just a domestic longhair (if that matters). Anyway, I don’t allow her to sleep in my room at night bc, trust me, she won’t let me sleep. I know she gets lonely at night, but I also need to sleep. She has a lot of toys and enrichment to keep her preoccupied. 

She used to occasionally bite the tops of my feet in the morning as I made coffee to let me know she wanted affection. I never rewarded or punished her for this behavior. I always just walked away to let her know that biting me resulted in the loss of my attention. Ever since we moved to our new home, she bites my feet every morning and when I walk away, she chases after me to keep doing it. Even if I’ve already taken a moment to pet her. I usually redirect her to her toys and help her initiate some play time. This works sometimes, but now I notice that any time she wants attention, she bites me & when I ignore her or firmly say no, she breathes hard through her nose, which I know to be her “I’m mad” sound. 

I pay her A LOT of attention throughout the day. I also deal with a dog who seeks a lot of attention and they often compete with each other for my affection. I make my best efforts daily to provide them both equal affection, stimulation, & exercise. So, I’m not really sure what I’m doing wrong and the daily biting is becoming a huge issue. I know she’s trying to tell me she needs something and I want to give that to her, but I can’t figure out how to meet that to her standards while also correcting the biting. Anyone else dealt with this or have some tips that maybe I haven’t tried?

[The pay gap between executives and the workers is intense](https://ecency.com/hive-161155/@princessluv/usd95-8-million-for-starbucks)

At Starbucks, a brand that if you're familiar with, markets itself as progressive and community minded, has the CEO receiving $95.8 million in a year, while the median worker earned just $14,674. Of course we should not envy but you want to know that ratio?

It's 6,666 to 1

If you earn 1 dollar, your Starbucks CEO earned $6,666.

You could easily defend this system by saying CEOs create enormous value or that the market simply rewards talent but can anyone truly believe that a Starbucks CEO works 6,666 times harder or smarter than a barista serving coffee at 5 a.m. I doubt the CEO is even awake at that time.

The real truth is that this is not a problem of talent or merit, it's the power dynamics and it is also about how wealth has been concentrated at the top while those at the bottom struggle to pay rent or afford health care.

This inequality is not only unfair, it is very dangerous. When workers see executives earning millions while their own paychecks is even shrinking, it will inevitably fuel anger and resentment and the worst, apathy.

Crafting an Effective 1100 Calories a Day Meal Plan for Weight Loss
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Crafting a meal plan that restricts calorie intake to 1100 calories a day can be a useful strategy for effective weight loss. However, it's crucial to approach this careful balance with consideration of your nutritional needs. Lowering calorie intake significantly requires planning to ensure you still receive essential nutrients. Here are some tips to create an effective 1100 calorie meal plan that will help you stay on track while also giving your body the nutrition it needs.

### Start with Breakfast

Breakfast is a vital meal. It kick-starts your metabolism and fuels your morning activities. Here’s a simple breakfast idea to incorporate into your meal plan:

- **Oatmeal Bowl:** Prepare a half-cup of oats with water or unsweetened almond milk. Top it with a tablespoon of peanut butter and half a banana. This hearty meal will keep you full and energized.

This breakfast totals around **300 calories**, providing you with fiber and healthy fats to start your day right.

### Include a Healthy Lunch

For lunch, focus on incorporating proteins, healthy fats, and plenty of vegetables. Here’s a balanced lunch option:

- **Grilled Chicken Salad:** Use 3 ounces of grilled chicken breast, mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, and a light vinaigrette. Add a slice of whole-grain bread on the side.

This meal can come to roughly **350 calories**, keeping you satiated while providing protein and essential vitamins.

### Plan a Light Dinner

Dinner should be light but satisfying. Here’s a nutritious option:

- **Vegetable Stir-Fry:** Stir-fry a cup of mixed vegetables like bell peppers, broccoli, and snap peas in one teaspoon of olive oil. Add a half-cup of cooked brown rice and a scrambled egg for protein.

This dish rounds up to about **350 calories**, allowing you to enjoy a wholesome and flavorful meal in the evening.

### Don't Forget Snacks

Snacks are important during a weight-loss journey, but they should be chosen wisely. Here are two healthy snack options:

- **Greek Yogurt:** A small cup (6 ounces) of plain Greek yogurt topped with half a cup of berries will add approximately **100 calories**.
- **Carrot Sticks with Hummus:** A serving of carrot sticks with two tablespoons of hummus adds another **100 calories**.

These snacks will offer you a boost of energy and necessary fiber while keeping calories in check.

### Staying Hydrated

While focusing on your meal plan, don’t forget about hydration. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Herbal teas or black coffee can also be incorporated, as they are low in calories. Staying hydrated contributes to overall health and can help control hunger.

### Tracking Your Progress

Monitoring your food intake and weight loss journey is essential. Use a food diary app to log your meals and calories. This habit not only keeps you accountable but helps you understand your eating patterns. Adjust your meals as necessary to ensure you meet your 1100 calorie goal while remaining balanced.

### Consult with a Professional

Before starting any low-calorie diet, it’s wise to talk to a healthcare provider or nutritionist. They can provide personalized guidance to ensure you are losing weight healthily. Individual nutritional needs vary significantly based on factors such as age, gender, activity level, and health status.

A well-structured 1100 calories a day meal plan doesn’t have to be daunting. With focus and planning, you can create a meal plan that supports your weight loss goals while providing the necessary nutrition. Trust your body, listen to your needs, and adjust as you go. Every small step can lead to significant changes over time.

Nutritional Considerations and Tips for Sustaining an 1100 Calorie Diet
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintaining a diet of 1100 calories per day can be a challenging yet effective method for some individuals looking to lose weight or manage their health. However, it's crucial to prioritize nutrition while on such a low-calorie plan to ensure you get the essential vitamins and minerals your body needs. Below are some nutritional considerations and tips to help sustain an 1100 calorie diet effectively.

### Understanding Nutritional Needs

During calorie restriction, it’s vital to choose nutrient-dense foods that provide the most nutrition per bite. This means focusing on foods that are high in essential vitamins and minerals while being lower in calories. Here’s what to keep in mind:

- **Macronutrients Matter:** Balance your intake of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Aim for a ratio where protein makes up about 25-30% of your daily intake, healthy fats 20-25%, and carbohydrates 45-55%. This balance helps in maintaining muscle mass and energy levels.
- **Micronutrients Are Key:** Ensure you include a variety of fruits and vegetables to cover your micronutrient needs. Leafy greens like spinach and kale, as well as colorful vegetables like bell peppers and tomatoes, are particularly beneficial.
- **Healthy Fats:** Incorporate sources like avocados, nuts, or seeds. These provide energy and help you feel full without overshooting your calorie limit.
- **Staying Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Hydration aids digestion and can help curb feelings of hunger.

### Creating a Balanced Meal Plan

Building a meal plan around 1100 calories requires some creativity and planning. Below is a sample breakdown of what your meals could look like throughout the day:

- **Breakfast (250 calories):**  
     - 1 cup of oatmeal (150 calories)  
     - 1 tablespoon of almond butter (100 calories)
- **Snack (100 calories):**  
     - 1 medium apple (95 calories)  
     - A sprinkle of cinnamon (negligible calories)
- **Lunch (300 calories):**  
     - Grilled chicken salad made with 3 oz of grilled chicken (140 calories), 2 cups of mixed greens (15 calories), cherry tomatoes (15 calories), cucumber slices (10 calories), and a light vinaigrette dressing (120 calories)
- **Snack (100 calories):**  
     - 1 cup of carrots and cucumber slices with 2 tablespoons of hummus (100 calories)
- **Dinner (350 calories):**  
     - 4 oz grilled salmon (230 calories)  
     - 1 cup of steamed broccoli (55 calories)  
     - ½ cup of quinoa (120 calories)

This meal plan adds up to 1100 calories while providing excellent nutritional value through a mix of protein, fats, and carbohydrates.

### Tips for Success

Here are some strategies to help you stay on track with your 1100 calorie diet:

- **Meal Prep:** Prepare meals in advance so you can easily grab healthy options and avoid last-minute poor food choices.
- **Keep a Food Journal:** Documenting what you eat can help you stay accountable and make you more aware of your nutritional choices.
- **Be Flexible:** Some days, you might feel hungrier than others. Listen to your body’s hunger cues and adjust as needed, while still adhering to your calorie limit over time.
- **Monitor Your Energy Levels:** If you feel fatigued, consider adjusting your macronutrient ratios or increasing your calorie intake slightly to find a better balance.

It’s important to remember that an 1100 calorie diet may not be suitable for everyone. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any diet plan, particularly one that restricts calories significantly. Following these tips and being mindful of your food choices can lead to a sustainable and healthy approach to an 1100 calorie diet.

### Conclusion

Creating a successful 1100 calories a day meal plan requires careful thought and attention to your nutritional needs. As you embark on this low-calorie journey, it's important to prioritize a balanced intake of proteins, healthy fats, and carbohydrates. This will not only fuel your body but also support your long-term health while promoting weight loss.

To effectively stick to this meal plan, consider utilizing meal prep techniques.

When I was taking Vyvanse the first days it was like a miracle. It was like an anti anxiety, anti depressant + strong coffee all at once and I felt hope for my life for the first time in a while. Got more done in 2 days than I had in 8 months prior. I have had some on/ off days and now I did not take Vyvanse for two days. One day planned because I don't want to take it daily, and then yesterday as well because I accidently woke up too late to take it, so skipped. I took it today after two days off and... I don't feel a lot? I know my pms has hit. I still felt anti anxiety effects of it but... I was ravenous whereas usually on Vyvanse I'm not hungry at all. I was misplacing things and a bit of a chaotic mess (like usual). Was quite brain dead and lethargic... Definitely better than I felt yesterday with no Vyvanse (I had a panic attack because the world felt overwhelming on my commute to work) so especially anxiety wise but... The effect is barely anything compared with my first days on Vyvanse, despite a 2 day break. Anyone else relate?",3,1755964880.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

Expert Guide for Company Formation and Taxation in 2025,"Are There Any Withholding Taxes in Bahrain? Expert Guide for Company Formation and Taxation in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business people in a professional corporate meeting collaborating at a modern office., Bahrain’s GDP is set to grow 2.9% this year, even amid regional volatility. Reuters notes FDI into Bahrain reached $1.85 billion in Q1 2025, fueled by tech, FinTech, and logistics. The EDB’s partnership with Amazon Web Services and new start-up zones at Bahrain Bay are drawing global attention, confirmed by Reuters.\
Comparisons with the UAE or Saudi Arabia? Bahrain’s business culture is uniquely approachable. Setting up in Bahrain Bay or the Diplomatic Area often comes with less red tape and more personal interaction—government offices in the MOICT building run on a first-name basis after a few visits (true story: my Commercial Registration was processed in a single morning after greeting the same Sijilat desk team during Ramadan).\
Visit bahrain.com for government policies and sector-specific incentives. For those considering company formation, KeylinkBH explains the full landscape here.\
What stands out? The absence of a corporate income tax (except for a select few sectors), no personal income tax, and—importantly for this article—no withholding tax. But there are details you should know.\
The Core Question: Are There Any Withholding Taxes in Bahrain?\
Definitive answer: Bahrain does not impose any withholding tax on dividends, interest, royalties, management fees, or service payments to foreign or local entities. Zero percent. This applies to companies set up anywhere in Bahrain, whether in Bahrain Bay, the Seef District, or one of the new free zones.\
\
Expert tip: International clients love Bahraini invoices—there’s no surprise deduction for cross-border payments, making Bahrain a “clean remittance” jurisdiction for investors and digital nomads.\
\
This policy is a major competitive edge over the UAE (which introduced a 9% corporate tax in 2023 and still applies some limited withholding tax provisions) and Saudi Arabia (which has 5-20% withholding on various cross-border payments).\
Practical Example:\
An IT company based at Bahrain Financial Harbour provides consulting services to a client in Germany. The client wires $25,000 for work performed. In Bahrain, you receive the full amount—no government deduction, no administrative paperwork, no tax filings on incoming funds. Your bank statement is clean, and your accounting stays simple.\
No Withholding Tax: But Don’t Skip Other Key Obligations\
\
Companies must still adhere to VAT (10% since 2022 for most goods/services).\
Payroll obligations exist via monthly LMRA fees and social insurance.\
Industry-specific levies can apply (oil/gas).\
Economic substance and transfer pricing rules are emerging—consult a specialist for multi-entity groups.\
\
Common mistake: Many new investors assume “no withholding tax” means no compliance requirements. That’s not the case. You must keep robust accounting records and stay VAT-compliant. For real support, KeylinkBH’s accounting services are worth every dinar—saved me hours of headaches (I once misfiled a VAT report during a busy Q2, and their team untangled the mess in 24 hours).\
Understanding Business Structures and Foreign Ownership in Bahrain\
\

- Public Shareholding Company (BSC)*\
Straightforward entity comparisons are here.\
Since the policy overhaul in January 2025, 99% foreign ownership is now the default in most sectors—even outside free zones (details here). A few sensitive categories (e.g. oil, security) may still have local partner rules, but tech, finance, logistics, restaurants, and professional services are wide open.\

\
Submit Application via Sijilat and Get Preliminary Approval\
Needed documents: Owner passports, address proof, business plan (brief), tenancy contract, and share capital deposit letter from your bank.\
\
Insider tip: Tenancy contracts at Bahrain Bay are processed faster—plus, the queue is shorter after 2:30pm during Ramadan. I saved 2 hours using this timing last April!\

Healthcare, education, and F&B require more checks—plan for +10 business days.\
\
Shortcut: Tamkeen and EDB offices in the Diplomatic Area offer one-stop desks for start-ups.\
\
\
Open Bank Account\
\
Major banks: Bank of Bahrain & Kuwait (BBK), Gulf International Bank, or local Islamic banks.\
\
Tip: Gulf International Bank at Seef Mall branch is expat-friendly, familiar with company structures.\
\
\
LMRA Labor Registration\
\
Register for work visas and social insurance.\
\
Majlis networking: Often, a personal referral at LMRA speeds up initial file review.\
\
\
VAT Registration (if annual sales > BHD 37,500)\
\
Set up accounting software immediately.\
\
Bookkeeping support recommended.\
\
\
Annual Compliance\
\
Submit audited accounts (now mandatory for companies >BHD 100,000 turnover from 2025)\
Renew CR on time (avoid fines).\
\
\
Challenge I faced: My first CR renewal clashed with Eid holidays—documents piled up, agents were off-duty. Now, I recommend timing all critical filings five business days before public holidays and using SMS renewal alerts.\
\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Bahrain Company Formation in 2025\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company incorporation and operation.):\
\
Company Registration: BHD 350–500 (one-time government fees, depends on structure)\
CR Renewal (annual): BHD 100–200\
Office Rent Seef District: BHD 250–450/month for virtual offices; Physical: BHD 900–2,500/month\
Accounting/Bookkeeping: BHD 320–600/year, depending on transaction volume\
Bank Account Opening: Free, but minimum deposit BHD 1,000–5,000 for most business accounts\
External Auditor (if required): BHD 250–900/year\
\
Hidden costs caught me off guard once: LMRA labor fees are BHD 72/month per foreign worker, and annual health insurance is now required for all employees (since March 2025).\
Budget tip: Start with a virtual office address (offered in Bahrain Bay and Seef) to save 60–75% on initial outlay. Physical addresses can be upgraded post-launch.\

\

The 2025 Regulatory Change: Audited Accounts and Sijilat Upgrades\
Importantly, as of April 1, 2025, Bahrain implemented mandatory digital filings for all corporate entities via Sijilat. Any company with annual revenue above BHD 100,000 must upload audited financial statements by March 31 each year, aligning with OECD standards. Non-compliance? Penalty of BHD 1,500 and restriction on CR renewal.\
\
Insider advantage: Use Sijilat’s “pre-submit” feature before the deadline—even as a draft. It timestamps your filing and provides extra grace period, which saved me from a nasty fine when our external auditor’s report was delayed.\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: Insider Culture, Networking, and Business Etiquette\
\
Majlis-style meetings (informal, often at a partner’s office or cafe) build trust fast. Don’t skip the coffee and date routine; it’s a sign of respect.\
Ramadan business hours (usually 8am–2pm) can delay official paperwork—always schedule important filings early in the morning.\
Directness: Bahraini government officers appreciate polite persistence; following up in person at MOICT or LMRA is more effective than emails.\
Networking: Virtually everyone in the business districts, from Bahrain Bay to the Diplomatic Area, welcomes new connections—carry business cards in both English and Arabic.\
\
Odd tangent? Absolutely! During my first MOICT visit, I stumbled into a Bahraini calligrapher’s exhibit in the lobby. That five-minute chat led to a referral for my company formation consultant. In Bahrain, every encounter can lead to business.\
Comparison: Bahrain vs UAE/Saudi on Withholding Tax and Business Setup\
\
UAE: 9% corporate tax on profits over AED 375,000 (since 2023), some withholding on cross-border service fees. Residency visas tied to office rent.\
Saudi Arabia: Withholding tax rates from 5–20% for foreign payments, more rigid local partner requirements.\
Bahrain: Still zero withholding tax in all sectors (except for oil/gas), no restrictions on repatriating profits, and more affordable setup costs.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation and Withholding Taxes\
1. Are there any hidden taxes for Bahrain companies?\
\
No. There are no withholding taxes, and corporate income tax applies only to oil/gas companies. Watch for VAT (10%) and payroll levies.\
More on costs: Bahrain company formation cost.\
\
2. Do I need a local sponsor or partner to form a company?\
\
Not for most sectors—99% foreign ownership is allowed (see full list). Sponsorship requirements are rare and clearly defined.\
\
3. What’s the fastest way to register my business in Bahrain?\
\
Prepare all documents in advance, use Sijilat portal early in the week, and choose an address in Bahrain Bay or Seef for speedier processing (step-by-step guide here).\
\
4. Are free zones better for avoiding taxes?\
\
Withholding tax is zero everywhere, but free zones offer extra perks like simplified customs and 100% foreign ownership for all nationalities (explore Bahrain free zones).\
\
5. How do I stay compliant with Bahrain’s accounting laws?\
\
Hire a local bookkeeping or accounting provider familiar with Bahrain’s new 2025 rules (get expert help) and always file digital reports on Sijilat before the deadline.\
\
\
Personal Recommendation: For entrepreneurs seeking a truly open, tax-efficient gateway to the Gulf and beyond, Bahrain is a standout. The absence of withholding tax is more than a technicality—it’s a real, daily business advantage.

Preeti Pinch had been quietly lurking for a while, but finally bit the bullet and got started.

3 days in… she had 3 wins to share.

1. WIN 1: She already booked a coffee date/demo call from tapping into their warm network.
2. WIN 2: She threw together a quick cold email campaign and got two positive replies, where talks are ongoing.
3. WIN 3: She jumped on a call with one of these prospects on Friday and the business owner now wants pricing for taking over ALL of their lead gen. Not just B2C but B2B too!

This right here is EXACTLY why you’ll keep hearing me say “Sell First, Build Later”.

We can take an educated guess about what a business's biggest headache is, but…

Until we get on a coffee date with them, we don’t FULLY know what challenges they're facing and how we can help.

Sure, we maximise our chances of success by leading with a “crowd-pleaser” offer that is turning old leads into sales using AI. But, we don’t know FOR SURE until they tell us.

Preeti understood this. She also understood that to really find a good business to work with, She had to completely detach herself from NEEDING a client to say yes to her.

Because the most important part of any good coffee date isn’t the outcome. It’s the quality of the conversation. Asking questions. Listening to what they have to say. Following up with more Qs to uncover what’s REALLY causing friction in their business.

And we do all this BEFORE we make them any kind of offer.

This approach is how Preeti got her foot in the door with DBR + AI, but then wrapped up the conversation with someone ready to hand over their entire lead generation operation!

So, if you’ve not started doing outreach yet because you’ve been overthinking your “sales pitch” or haven't felt “confident enough” with the tech. This is your gentle reminder to get yourself out of the analysis paralysis hole.

Don't overcomplicate things.

If you want to shortcut the guesswork and have the exact outreach templates, conversation flows, and positioning strategies that make this process simple… grab the [**Survive to Thrive Playbook**](https://honeysyed.com/flexxable). It’s built to help you go from stuck in analysis paralysis to landing your first AI deal fast.

Do the outreach with our crowd-pleaser offer of the century: “Do you have any old leads I can turn into sales on a performance basis?”.

Get on calls with business owners and focus on asking questions, NOT getting a yes. Then, if after talking you think you can help, Offer to build the AI solution they need to fix their problems (team up with techy people if you have to)

And I am so sorry.","I’ve found myself here a few times now - I learned about 7OH for the first time just from a random Reddit comment and have since read hundreds of harrowing & disturbing stories of addiction/withdrawal. I’m not trying to “gawk” here - I’m truly appalled at what I’ve now discovered is being sold OTC at vape shops as “natural, plant-based, life-enhancing elixirs.” I was in high school when the opiate epidemic hit and I’m all too familiar with watching friends spiral into an addiction that innocently began with them being prescribed oxy for various reasons. I’ve lost many friends and for the others witnessed years long recovery & relapse cycles. 

Feel Free, 7Oh, & even Kratom are masquerading under the guise of being “natural plants” while also intentionally deceiving the insidious reality of what they’re doing. Extracting the active compounds behind closed doors, hidden behind dozens of shell LLCs, minimizing or more likely not even telling potential users that no part of this is “natural” except for the day the actual plant was harvested across the world. What chemicals are they using to cut and extract? Rat poison? Jet fuel? Cyanide? I read through the Feel Free class action suit & many other terrifying wrongful death suits from 7Oh. This is… beyond. 

This shit is terrifying and I’ve got to say - the posts in here are so important and you guys even being in here (wherever you are in your journey) is amazing because it means you are ready to take your life back from these disgusting companies who have tried to steal it from you.


Not for nothing, but a recent post in here mentioned another “wellness elixir” company on instagram doing the same thing as Feel Free - not only that - but based on recent FDA movements targeting 7OH companies and Feel Free - this new companies disclaimers and acknowledgements of the dangers of what they’re selling is severely lacking, predatory, and is purposefully obfuscating the reality of the poison they’re selling. They say on their website in regard to its addictive properties “You can get addicted to anything that makes you feel good. Coffee, sex. Use in moderation.”

In my head, “budget” meant: say goodbye to morning coffee, say goodbye to outings, say goodbye to anything with a bit of fun. Honestly, I didn’t want to live like that.

But when I finally tried it in real life, I was shocked it was the opposite. Budgeting doesn’t take away your freedom, it’s what actually gives you real freedom. When you know exactly how much is set aside for each thing, you can spend without guilt. For example, I now set aside $60 just for coffee shops. The result? I can grab my coffee every week and never feel guilty. On the contrary, I enjoy it even more because I know that money is meant for it.

The best part is the anxiety drops a lot. I no longer have that constant worry of, “Will I make it to the end of the month or not?” Now I know my limits, and I choose where to spend without stress.

If you’ve had the same negative idea about budgeting, trust me try it for just one month and you’ll change your mind.

It was extremely bad, and it was addictive. I saw my weight drop fast and it felt amazing when people looked at me and told me that I was losing weight quickly and they wanted my secret. Until I started to pass out.

I have always had an issue with my heart, nothing big, but my HR has always been elevated, my BP is fine, but I was on medicine for it, and because I wasn't eating more than almost 400 calories a day, my medicine wasn't getting enough to stick to and it made me pass out- violently.

My boyfriend found out, and he told my therapist and we've been working on getting me a healthier relationship with food, but I still want to work out, improve nutrition and lose weight. Preferably without passing out and hitting my head on a cabinet again.

As of right now, I'm focusing on minimizing carbs, and upping protein and fiber intake, which I've been advised to do by my medical team. However I was wondering if there's any way I can improve it even further? Bf and I only go out to eat 1x a month, we're super low income as I'm a fulltime college student, work full time at minimum wage, and then he's disabled. We have enough to cover our bills, but not a lot to spend on ""organic"" foods or things like eggs, chicken, etc. We eat mostly canned food because our foodbank gives out a lot of cans. We have also about 25lbs of rice, and a bunch of instant mash potatoes. 

I don't really know how else to lose weight other than to start counting calories again, but my therapist advised that it wasn't a good idea to try again so soon, but I can't give up. My joints are killing me from all this weight and I need it off, for my physical and mental health.


tldr: counting calories activated some sort of sleeping eating disorder thats adversly affected my health. bf and therapist are helping me with it, but i need ways to improve my nutrition to help lose weight and keep it off for my mental health and physical health (particularly my joints.)",2,1755964522.0,Gymhelp,0,1.0,False

Have used Fuji in some way for about a decade now. Yes, I love my Sony bodies for certain purposes but the X100 series is a beautiful Swiss Army Knife ninja. 

Not long ago I sold my X100VI to go back to the Zf. It was an ‘emotional’ switch having lost a Zf in a house fire. The Zf is fun and very capable.. but it will never be a replacement for the X100… I was reminded of this today. My boys and I grab coffee every morning. It’s been a ritual for about a year now and I truly love this time with them. They are used to me taking snaps of them.. sometimes they have fun for the shots and sometimes.. “Dad STOP!”  😎

I have done this these coffee ‘sessions’ with every camera I’ve owned. As a side note I am happy to give feedback on any of them to anyone who is curious.. I have used Fuji, Sony, Ricoh GR.. 

Today we were sitting outside and my oldest was researching a topic we were discussing.. I wanted some shots of him with the Portra 400 recipe to see how it looked in the sun.. Check a box for Fuji.. 

I also wanted to shoot him wide open, f2 so that I could blur out some of the ‘city’ behind us. X100VI has that covered.. but wide open in the bright sun.. didn’t have enough shutter speed.. turned on the ND filter.. another check for X100VI.. started taking shots and he was.. of course.. super dark with the sun coming up behind him.. turned on the flash.. another check for X100VI.. the final check IMO is that the leaf shutter is so silent he didn’t even know when I was firing off shots.. I ALWAYS want the casual.. look.. never the ‘pose’ or what I call skeleton smile.. 

This wasn’t a bag of gear. This was one little piece-of-art camera that almost NO ONE cares if you pull out and start taking photos.. 

I got a few keepers.. all that I was looking for.. and a few of them with the flash, backlight and that film sim.. had an almost digicam look to them.. but with WAY better resolution.. EXACTLY what I was looking for. 

Apologies for the long rant.. but damn.. it is such a great line of cameras.. 

I will also add that if you have small kids.. doing something like this is so awesome.. we do it before school and it is our ‘time’.. I love that we kick off the day this way. We have SO MANY parents with children who are older now.. who have said they wished they did something like this when their kids were younger. One day they will be ‘too old’ for it.. but no matter what… we will always have had these morning sessions. 

Cheers!

1my4wk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1my4wk7/choose_me_by_tess_gerritsen/,Choose Me By Tess Gerritsen,"Hey everyone!

I just finished a book that really kept me on the edge of my seat, and I wanted to share my thoughts with you all. It's Tess Gerritsen's *Choose Me*, and if you're curious, you can find it here: [Choose Me By Tess Gerritsen](https://pdfhive.com/choose-me-by-tess-gerritsen/). If you're looking for a gripping read, especially a psychological thriller, stick around!

**What's It About (No Spoilers, I Promise!)**

So, *Choose Me* centers around a doctor named Anna Belle, who seems to have a pretty perfect life. She's got a great career, a nice home, but there's this underlying sense of unease. Things take a sharp turn when she finds the body of a young woman in her neighborhood – a young woman who was also a brilliant medical student. As Anna gets drawn into the mystery, she starts to question everything, including her own memory and what’s real. It’s a twisty tale that really makes you wonder who to trust, and that feeling just keeps growing the deeper you get into the story.

**What Really Grabbed Me**

Firstly, the characters felt so real and complex. Dr. Anna Belle, our main character, is fascinating because she's not your typical flawless hero. She's got her own issues and vulnerabilities, which makes her very relatable. You find yourself rooting for her, even as you're questioning her perceptions. The way Gerritsen develops the supporting characters, even the ones who are only briefly on page, also adds a lot of depth to the mystery.

Tess Gerritsen’s writing style is, as always, fantastic for a thriller. She has this knack for creating a really tense atmosphere right from the start. The pacing was absolutely brilliant – it’s a page-turner in the truest sense. Just when you think you've figured things out, she throws in another curveball that makes you doubt everything. The emotional journey Anna goes through is palpable; you really feel her confusion, fear, and desperation. It's a masterclass in psychological suspense, making you question not just the characters but even your own judgment.

**A Balanced Look**

While I absolutely loved the suspense and the intricate plot, there were a couple of moments where I felt like the sheer number of twists could almost be overwhelming. Sometimes, a revelation would come so quickly after another that I had to pause and re-orient myself, which is both a testament to the author’s skill and a slight challenge for the reader! However, this is a minor point in what is otherwise a very tightly woven story. It definitely keeps you on your toes, which is what you want in this genre, right? You can find more details about the book here if you're interested: [Choose Me By Tess Gerritsen](https://pdfhive.com/choose-me-by-tess-gerritsen/).

**Would I Recommend It? Absolutely!**

If you're a fan of psychological thrillers, medical mysteries, or just stories that keep you guessing until the very last page, then you should definitely pick up *Choose Me*. It’s perfect for those who enjoy a smart, complex plot with characters that feel genuinely human. If you appreciate authors like Karin Slaughter or Shari Lapena, I think you'll really enjoy this one. However, if you prefer light-hearted reads or shy away from intense suspense, this might be a bit too much.

**Tips for New Readers (or Getting Back Into It!)**

Now, if all this talk of thrillers has you eager to pick up a book, or if you're just looking to get back into reading after a break, here are a few friendly tips from my own experience:

1.  **Start with Something Captivating:** Don't feel pressured to read a classic if it doesn't grab you. Choose a genre you already enjoy in other media (movies, TV shows). A fast-paced thriller like *Choose Me* can be a great entry point because the suspense keeps you turning pages.
2.  **Set Aside Dedicated Time:** Even 15-20 minutes a day can make a huge difference. Treat it like an appointment with your book. Before bed, during your commute, or with your morning coffee are great options.
3.  **Don't Be Afraid to Put a Book Down:** If a book isn't working for you after a few chapters, it's okay to move on. Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore. There are so many amazing books out out there waiting for you!
4.  **Join the Conversation:** Talking about books, whether with friends or in online communities like this one, can really enhance your reading experience. It’s fun to hear different perspectives and discover new titles.

Reading is a wonderful journey, and every book opens up a new world. Don't worry about how fast you read or what others are reading. Just enjoy the process!

1. Hawas + Bleu de Chanel

Hawas’s aquatic and fruity notes bdc's fresh citrus and woody. 1 spray on either side of neck. Is there a better way or science for layering? 

2. Turathi Blue + Club de Nuit Intense: The spice and smoke created a masculine blend. 1 spray from each as both were very strong. I might try this again.

3. Hawas + Club de Nuit Intense Man: Hawas’s fresh aquatic notes was dominant. Both were unidentifiable after 4-5 hours. I did not like this combo

4. Bleu de Chanel + Nitro Red: This created a complex scent. Watermelon smell prevailed after 4-5 hrs. Those who like experimenting and like fruity tomes, this one is interesting.

5. Turathi Blue + Hawas
This combo contrasted nicely, creating a dynamic, versatile blend. This was my favourite of all the above. Must try!

1my4vqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1my4vqc/delve_into_the_best_singleserve_brewer_nespresso/,Delve Into the Best Single-Serve Brewer Nespresso Vertuo Next Worth It,"I recently decided to try out the Nespresso ENV120BM, also known as the Vertuo Next Coffee and Espresso Machine. I’m a devoted coffee fanatic who appreciates a good cup of espresso in the morning and loves experimenting with different coffee blends. Naturally, this machine caught my eye because it promised versatility, precision brewing, and sustainability in a compact package. After a few weeks of brewing with it, I have plenty to say. Buckle up because this is as honest as it gets.

**Design and Build Quality**  
What grabbed me straight away was the sleek and minimalistic design. The machine measures just 5 inches wide, which means it takes up almost no counter space. This is great if your kitchen is as crowded as mine. The matte black finish gives it a modern, professional look, and it feels well-made despite being crafted using 54% recycled materials. Bonus points for sustainability! However, the lightweight frame does make it feel a little less sturdy than I expected, especially at 12 pounds. It's fully automatic, and all it takes is the push of a button, which feels intuitive and convenient.

**Expert Brewing with Precision**  
One feature that really sets this coffee maker apart is its Centrifusion technology. Honestly, it feels almost magical when the barcode-scanning system recognizes the specific Vertuo capsule and adjusts the brewing settings accordingly. The coffee extraction process is smooth and produces a creamy layer of foam, aka crema, that coffee enthusiasts dream about. I’ve tried different capsule sizes: 5 oz, 8 oz, 18 oz coffee servings, and single and double espressos. Each time, the taste was astonishingly consistent, almost like I had my own personal barista. One small caveat: the system strictly works with Vertuo capsules, which is a bit limiting if you prefer third-party pod options.

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
Using this machine is ridiculously simple. Insert a capsule, close the lever, and hit the button. That's it. The buttons are big enough to operate easily, even when I’m rushing in the morning. I find the automatic shut-off feature super handy because I often forget to turn off my appliances. Cleaning the machine is a breeze too, as the used capsules automatically drop into a container and can be recycled. The only downside here is that I wish Nespresso added a slightly larger capsule container since it tends to fill up relatively quickly.

**Perks**  
- Compact design slashes countertop clutter.  
- Sustainable build materials appeal to eco-conscious users.  
- One-touch brewing simplifies the coffee-making process.  

[Check Nespresso ENV120BM price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b08gl2nj2y/)

**Critiques**  
- Locked-in compatibility means you’re stuck using only Vertuo capsules.  
- Capsule container size could be bigger for convenience.  
- Slightly lightweight, which makes it feel less durable.  

**Sustainability Efforts**  
This machine goes above and beyond when it comes to being environmentally friendly. It’s made of recycled materials, which aligns with more conscious coffee consumption. Furthermore, the sealed aluminum capsules are fully recyclable, and returning them through Nespresso's recycling program is surprisingly easy. Because coffee and sustainability don't always go hand in hand, this machine earns major points in this area.

**Frothy Milk Dreams with the Aeroccino3**  
Let me rave for a second about the Aeroccino3 frother that comes bundled with the machine. Whether I’m craving a hot latte on a cold morning or iced coffee in the summer, this frother made the process seamless. It’s quiet—seriously, you can barely hear it—and works on all milk types, from whole to plant-based. A quick press, and bam, you’ve got beautifully frothed milk that elevates your coffee game.

**Competing Brands**  
I couldn’t resist comparing it to the Keurig K-Elite. The Keurig can also brew several cup sizes and has a more universal pod compatibility. However, the flavor falls short of Nespresso’s premium coffee quality. Another contender is the Breville Bambino Plus, which excels in manual espresso designs, but it lacks the automation and capsule convenience that this machine offers. What makes the Vertuo Next shine is its ability to balance high-end coffee quality with user-friendly technology. If you’re someone like me who refuses to compromise on either taste or convenience, this machine delivers.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering the feature set and sophisticated brewing process, this machine offers decent value for the investment. You’re undeniably limited to using Vertuo pods, which can be pricier over time, but the exceptional coffee quality makes up for it. Cheaper options do exist, but they often compromise on taste or sustainability, which is a no-go for me. At the end of the day, it’s worth it for anyone serious about coffee and willing to stick to the Nespresso ecosystem.

It looks like Chris Paddack (5.10 ERA) will start for Detroit this evening, friends. I’m a big advocate of the Over on this game – Paddock has allowed 13 runs on 18 hits in just his last 3 starts. On the other side, Michael Wacha has been great lately; the Royals have won his last 5 straight starts, but the Over has cashed in both of his last 2 road outings. Wth the Tigers offense seemingly finding their footing again (they’ve cashed the Over in 5 of their last 6 games…) I say this encounter sees at least 9 runs.

This fundamental lack of sensation has been a major barrier to the seamless integration of robots into human environments, particularly in fields requiring delicate handling, nuanced interaction, and safety. However, a recent breakthrough by researchers at the University of Cambridge and University College London (UCL) promises to change this reality.

1my4qa7,https://v.redd.it/p9seix61dskf1,"Dawah in Venezuela, Latin America: Tips for dawah and new muslims","We've been able al hamdulillah to start our dawah project in my home country, Venezuela. 

We are using two means:

* In person Dawah. This is by far the most effective. People are genuinly interested in Islam and they like talking to us. 
* Digital Dawah. At the moment we are using paid social ads where people reach out to us via messenger or whatsapp. 

In terms of our learnings, here is our methodology:

1. Use a hook. For example, you might have noticed that I have a red beard with afghani pants and I sometimes wear a turban. My wife wears the hijab. On top of that our stand mentions ""I'll write your name in arabic for free"", we have coffee, stuff like that. In our social media ads we try to be chocking. For example, we compare christian evangelical people dancing in church vs muslims doing sujood in Makkah. Which one prays like Jesus? So on.
2. Get to know who you're talking with. Here people are predominantly Catholic or Evangelical. Sometimes you have Satanists (Vudoo), sometimes Deists or Atheists. Surprisingly, Satanists and Vudoo are very intrigued by Islam.
3. Get them to agree that there is one God that deserves to be worshipped. That his God is not a human, and He is not 3 in 1. For example, if they are christians you can prove to them from their own scriptures that god is not a human, and jesus is not god. 
4. Get them to agree that god sends messangers and books. You can talk about either first. It doesn't really matter. Make sure that they understand that Jesus is a messenger as Muhammad (saws). Make sure they understand that the Quran is the last scripture and that the Bible has been corrupted (it's easy to prove using contradictions).
5. If they agree to the above, tell them that what separates them from becoming muslims is their shahadah. Invite them to take the shahadah with you.

  
Couple points:

* They have to understand what being muslim implies. That there is NO DEITY WORTHY OF WORSHIP EXCEPT ALLAH. If they are Christians, I ask them to add the following when they say the spanish shahadah before arabic: and I bear witness that Jesus is the servant and messenger of God, he is not God nor the son of god. They have to understand that they are not from their former religion any more.
* Mention to them the 6 pillars of Iman and the 5 pillars of Islam. I normally do it prior to them taking their shahadah and after as well. As you wish.
* Tell them after they become muslim what are the benefits of their shahadah such as their sins forgiven, etc, that they start from scratch... and so on
* Tell them that they must now start learning salah

Beyond taking shahadas for the sake of it, it's really important to follow up with new muslims. Take their phone number. I normally try to do a weekly call with them. Follow up.

Also, avoid critizing them or their lifestyle yet. It took at least 13 years for the prohibition of alcohol to be revealed, yet the sahabah were with the prophet saws and they saw the revelation come down and the miracles, etc. Be patient with new muslims. The most important is that they learn Tawhid (Aqidah) and Salah and that they be consistent with Salah as this will make them abandon their bad habits.

My gf of just 6mos is pregnant, 6weeks, she found out right away 2 weeks ago. 

The first week, I admit, I rebelled.  I tried to get her to get an abortion. I went and partied every night and left her waiting on me.   I said some pretty mean things to her in an attempt to get her to do it too.  It was not fair, she told me she was against abortion on our 2nd date, and then we had a few other conversations regarding politics which solidified that she would never get one so idk why I even tried.  I was just panicked. 

Well, what snapped me out of it was I wanted to talk to her at my house, to make sure she was okay, I didn’t want her stressed out, from what I heard, she literally didn’t eat for days, I didn’t know that’s how she responded to stress but according to a family member, she will only drink coffee and water and then not eat if she’s really stressed, so I was think, she can come over and I can take her to breakfast well………she declined to see me because she said “this is how women end up dead.”  I would never do anything to her but I understand logically where she is coming from. Women do end up dead because they don’t get the abortion that a man wants, I love her though so it really hurt me to know my words scared her like that.

Eventually. 3 days later, she agreed to meet me. I was playing like I was going to do a side kick, (I do do mma and I do like to fight the air sometimes when I’m bored or if it comes to mind) and she flinched really hard.  She’s never done that before, usually just laughs at me.  But I know I have some healing I need to do with her now because I’m actually excited for the baby to come and to see her growing belly, I’m excited to see the first ultrasound, everything. When I asked her if she’s scared of me, she said No, but I asked why she flinched and she said “I didn’t” so she’s subconsciously afraid of me if she didn’t realize she flinched the way she did. 

That same day I thought I’d tell her what’s on my mind because I don’t want her to be afraid of me.  I told her I want to do a gender reveal and that I hope it’s a boy so I will name him the 2nd (II) instead of junior, I told her that some of my friends know and they’re excited for us.  I am looking for a new house for us,  everything.

And she seems open, like she’s okay with everything I said but idk I feel like that week of me trying to convince her of the abortion tainted the relationship.

On top of that, her ex husband was abusive, example: she had to pull a home protection device on him to get him to stop a rampage one time.  On top of that she was abused as a child.  So I really screwed up.  I basically put her on edge because of my own selfishness and panicking and idk if she can trust me like she used to. 

I asked her if she was excited yesterday and she said “not really” and I asked if it was because of me, she said No, but I know it’s because of me.

I dont care if random people think i’m pretty. I dont care if randos buy me a coffee or hold a door for me. None of that matters to me, I just want to be pretty enough to be wanted and loved romantically. Like TRULY wanted, like I’d be picked from a crowd, not settled for when he really wishes he could have gotten the 9/10. I see comments on reddit of people saying their current partner isnt that attractive and so many people are better looking and it makes me sick. Ive seen guys on reddit say they compare their gf to random women and wish she had their features. What even is the point of being in a romantic relationship if my boyfriend is going to think of me like that? No man dreams of wifeing a 4-5/10, even a 6/10. Shit I saw some tweet from a guy saying a huge struggle every man goes through is settling for a 6/10 when there’s a 10/10 he really wants. Imagine how they feel about 4s and 5s!  I will never be enough for a partner if I’m not pretty, I will never be fully romantically loved if I’m not pretty. I will always be a 2nd choice, or letts be real a 10th choice. It doesnt matter if I have the most perfect personality, i’ll never be his dream girl, and he’d always pick for a pretty girl to have my personality if he could. 

I just want to be pretty for the love of my life. I want him to like seeing my bare face in the morning. I want him to be happy with me and to say he would choose me in a room full of women. What man is going to feel this way about a below average looking woman? 99.99% of men want a pretty life partner, and if he doesn’t get one then he’s settling, period. I feel like I’m missing out on TRUE love all because of my face.

My distress about my looks mostly comes from dating. If I gave up on dating entirely I would not lose my shit over being ugly, I actually think I’d live a relatively peaceful life. But I’m a romantic at heart and I do crave a romantic life partner. But at this point I’d rather die alone than be with someone whos settling for me and only loves me 50%

PCF smells a lot better than the Chestnut Roasted Croissant by far! It’s very similar to Vanilla Bean but it has very subtle pumpkin spice notes to it and it is definitely a more creamy, and actually foamy frothier version of Vanilla Bean

For those expecting a coffee scent, you’re not going to get it wi the this one, the candle is only the cold foam which I love. I fear it might be a little generic and I don’t really like the label but I mean the scent matters more to me than anything

The scent on cold is exactly what you get when you warm it. The throw is a 7.5/10 and I have a very small room I warm my candles in. For how light and airy the scent is, it was a lot stronger than I was expecting! I don’t understand what online reviews on the website were saying when they said they were standing next to it and couldn’t smell it.

But yeah I love this one! It’s basically a fall variant Vanilla Bean 2.0. If you like light, not super overpowering sweet scents, this one is for sure a must buy!

My overall rating for Pumpkin Cold Foam is a 8/10!!!

I can’t remember my childhood most of the time.

I remember a few friends names. I remember some embarressing moments.

I remember some of school.

I don’t remember growing up.

I don’t remember how my parents were.

I think I’ve blocked out most of my life.

Sometimes with how depressed I am I wonder if I’m blocking out something significant.

I often wish I had something to blame for the way I’m feeling.

Like maybe something awful happened and I just can’t remember it.

That must be it right? 

I mean from what I can remember I’ve had it good. Always a full tummy, a roof over my head, and a supportive family.

I mean I have some daddy issues but who doesn’t? 

So why is it that I feel this way?

Why is it at 12 years old I was cutting into my own body.
Why was I drawing maps to the closest bridge and writing letters after letters? 

I was talking to my brother the other day about the reasons I don’t want to have kids. 

I said if there’s even a chance my child would feel the way I felt that would ruin me. I wouldn’t even risk it.

He asked, “What was so bad about your life?”

I coudn’t find an answer.

What is so bad about my life? 

I’m come to the conclusion over and over again that I am just a weak person. That I just don’t have what it takes to live in this world successfully or happily.

That life is just too hard for me.

I don’t think any amount of therapy or medication could convince me otherwise even though I do try. 

On days that I do feel happy, it’s like a cloud is hanging over me. Telling me that it won’t last, that there’s no point in trying, or hoping because then I’ll be more disappointed when it leaves. 

A never ending cycle of extremes, feeling extremely happy and motivated, and having it all crash down, over, and over, and over again.

I’m tired of trying. I’m tired of feeling this way.
I’m tired of people telling me to find the good in the little things like the sun on my face, or walks in nature.

I don’t want to have to fight and fight and fight to feel better just to enjoy sunlight, or a fresh cup of coffee. 

That’s not worth it to me.

Im tired of hearing everything happens for a reason, that you need to feel sadness in order to feel happiness, that life is beautiful.

All of those sayings just make me feel worse.

Everything happens for a reason? Like people being raped and murdered? Like people starving? Like shootings, and cancer, and family members dying. That all happens for a reason? And we just have to accept that?

You need to feel sadness in order to feel happiness? Thats why I hate this world, because I need to feel mounds of despair, hopelessness, depression, in order to feel the fleeting feeling of happiness? 

Life is beautiful? I mean that’s just a joke. If I ignore every single awful, unjust, unfair, cruel, evil thing…. Then yes I guess life would be beautiful. 




I guess the kicker too is that I work in a Mental Health Providers office promoting mental well being, spouting all the things I don’t believe it. 

I guess if it brings somebody comfort that’s a great thing. I’ve yet to find the right analogy, or saying that makes any of this worth it.

1my4fl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1my4fl4/contractors_should_not_ask_to_use_the_customers/,Contractors should NOT ask to use the customer's bathroom.,"Here's a typical human day.

* You wake up at whatever time
* You use the bathroom (because you more than likely have something built up even if you don't have that ""feeling"", it's better to assume it's there than not)
* Have your coffee/eggs/bacon/toast while you read the paper and talk to your spouse and plan the business day, knowing you probably have to be onsite by 8-9a
* Coffee is a diuretic, so you need to figure out how to last until lunch break.  Now, you could do a port-a-potty, easier answer is, if you get that urge and can't hold until lunch, let the customer know you're taking a quick break and will be back; go to the nearby McDonalds/gas station/whatever, and you'll be back
   * At this point, the customer might **offer** for you to use their bathroom, and if they do, it's perfectly fine to accept (that's why reading the specific title as written is critical).

But what seems to consistently happen, is contractors that show up for the job, work for 10-ish minutes, then ask to use the bathroom.  Why didn't you take care of that before you left home?  ""Back In MY Day"", that's what parents would do when you were about to go somewhere; is tell their kid to use the bathroom before you leave.  What's changed?

Let's assume someone has a urinary situation; which is fine.  But it's unlikely you need to pee every 10 minutes.

1my4ek7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1my4ek7/spotlight_best_coffee_makers_keurig_kexpress/,Spotlight best coffee makers Keurig K-Express review worth it,"The Keurig K-Express 062151516229 has become a regular part of my mornings, and after weeks of personal use, I feel like it’s time to share my take on this single-serve coffee maker. As someone who can't function without coffee, this machine immediately caught my attention with its affordable entry into the Keurig brand. While it ticks plenty of boxes, there’s room for improvement in a few areas, so let’s dive into the details.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The minimalist design of this coffee maker is a big win for me. Its sleek, black, metallic finish makes it blend into my kitchen seamlessly, even adding a modern touch to my otherwise cluttered countertop. Measuring approximately 14.65"" in depth, 7.28"" in width, and 12.87"" in height, it’s compact enough to fit into tighter spaces like my office nook or even an RV. I’ve moved it around between my kitchen and home office, and its lightweight body (just a little over 6 pounds) makes it remarkably portable. The removable reservoir is super convenient when refilling, and I found myself appreciating the no-drip design—it keeps the brewing area clean and tidy.  

**Functionality and Ease of Use**  
Simplicity is a strong suit here. With its fully automatic operation mode, brewing coffee is a literal one-button task. The Keurig K-Express offers brew size options of 8, 10, or 12 ounces, which I often switch between depending on whether I need a bolt of energy or just a leisurely cup while reading. One feature I adore is the STRONG button that noticeably enhances the flavor profile for a bolder and more intense taste, which I didn’t think I’d be able to get with a pod system. It's fantastic for someone like me who sometimes likes a coffee that firmly declares its presence!

**Positives**  
- STRONG button delivers a richer, fuller coffee flavor.  
- Lightweight and designed for portability.  
- Back-to-back brewing eliminates the wait time between cups.  

[Check Keurig K-Express 062151516229 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b098zqlkq5/)  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Let’s talk results because, at the end of the day, that’s why we’re here. The coffee this machine brews is consistently hot, whether it’s the first cup in the morning or the fourth round while working late into the evening. I was impressed at how balanced the flavor is, especially considering it's a pod-based system. For those who prefer customization, the My K-Cup filter allows the use of ground coffee, which opens the doors to experimenting with premium coffee blends. Occasionally, I’ve brewed tea and hot cocoa pods too, and they come out just as flawless. The quick brew time (we’re talking under three minutes) is a lifesaver during busy mornings.

**Negatives**  
- Reservoir capacity could be larger, as frequent users will find refilling a chore after every 4 cups.  
- Limited to 8, 10, and 12-ounce cup sizes, with no espresso option for smaller servings.  

**Noise and Maintenance**  
In terms of noise, let’s face it, this isn’t the quietest brewer out there, but it’s far from a deal-breaker. During brewing, you might hear what I’d describe as a strong hum—not startling, but it won’t go unnoticed. Maintenance-wise, the removable drip tray and reservoir simplify cleaning significantly. I’ve been making a habit of running the descaling function every few weeks, as recommended, and it’s a straightforward process that helps keep performance consistent. 

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing it to competing single-serve brewers like the Nespresso Essenza Mini, a major advantage of the K-Express is its use of K-Cup pods, which encompass a broader range of flavors and are more budget-friendly than Nespresso capsules. However, the Essenza Mini outshines this one for espresso lovers with its specialized brewing. Another competitor worth mentioning is the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which offers dual brewing options (pods or full pots), but it’s bulkier and noisier, which some might find less appealing. Ultimately, I find the Keurig K-Express strikes a better balance for compact spaces and simple operation.

**Value for Money**  
From a cost-efficiency standpoint, this coffee maker certainly delivers what it promises—a Keurig experience without breaking the bank. The durable quality combined with features like the STRONG button and variety of brew sizes seals its value for everyday use. It isn’t packed with high-tech features, but most of the essentials are here, making it perfect for the budget-conscious or coffee enthusiasts looking for a straightforward setup.

Did I dodge a bullet?,"Background: I met this friend several years ago at a company we both worked at. She left the job but we kept in touch periodically over the years.

A few years back, we ran into each other and reconnected. We had both lost loved ones and so we were bonding over our grief.  We would meet for coffee and talk about our industry and vent to each other about our jobs or life. At the time, I had a terrible manager who was a narcissist and toxic. After venting to her I found out my friend's best friend was good friends with my boss. I had asked her to please not say anything to anyone, she promised and I believed her.

Last year, I was laid off and decided to take the summer off. My friend and I were still regularly talking and hanging out. She was freelancing at the time and she asked if I was interested in covering for her for few weeks while she was on vacation, I declined because I wanted to take a break. She decided to ask another friend (someone I had worked with before but wasn't close to). Shortly after, this vacation, my friend was offered a full time job at this company and she took the position. She needed help so she asked if I would be interested in doing freelance for a couple of weeks. I said yes. This is where things took a turn for the worse.

Initially I was excited to work with her. Although, we worked at the same company years ago, I never worked with her directly. The first week in, I wanted to pull my hair out and began to regret taking the job. Remember that friend she hired during her vacation? Apparently this person F-d up some project and my friend began bad mouthing her. This was the first red flag. During my time working with her, she often complained about other colleagues and when I offered solutions she brushed me off. She was extremely disorganized and at times there was tension because I would challenge her methods because I knew what she was doing was wrong. (our job is very technical). The position was extended another month but by the end of it I felt a strain between us, however we did leave on a good note.

Several months later, the company directly reached out to me to come back as a contractor. My friend had given her notice and they needed someone to hep transition her out and the new hire in. We overlapped working again another two weeks. This is the strange part-- my friend never reached out to tell me she was quitting and claims she didn't know HR would re-hire me. Then when I returned everyone was asking where did I go on vacation-- turns out she told everyone I left because I had vacation planned. This was untrue. I asked her about this and she claimed I told her I was traveling. The only thing I had told her was I was thinking of visiting my family out of state but never confirmed it nor it had nothing to do why I left. I left because she pushed me out and later found out she hired another friend. During the last two weeks, I felt like she had gossiped about me to others there. I could feel a weird vibe from her too. She refused to pass to me important docs and procedures claiming sinceI  was a temp it was unnecessary. The company hired a new person who somehow got in touch with my friend to ask about the company (our industry is very small). Although they weren't friends I have a feeling my ""friend"" bad mouthed me to this new person. When the new person started, they were very passive aggressive with me. In fact, shortly after they decided to end my contract early and give me a ""random"" schedule. I am a contractor with many clients and rely on consistent paycheck from them -- they gave me two days notice.  I anticipated drama and decided to part ways since I also had a new opportunity on the horizon. My friend never reached out once to check in on me in general or about the job she left. However, when I left earlier than expected, she must have found out and immediately texted me baiting me to give her gossip without straight up  asking me what happened. Of course I ignored it but now I question everything I ever confided in her including my old toxic boss and about my grief.",1,1755962731.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Bigla niya akong tinanong, “Ikaw ba, pano mo masasabing okay ka na sa life? Anong ultimate goal mo na masasabi mong satisfied ka na kung nasan ka?”

My answer? Magkaron ng sarili kong space that I can call *my own home* and a career that will allow me to live in that home comfortably.

Nung pauwi na, napa-reflect ako sa sagot ko. Iniisip ko, masyado bang mababaw yun? Narealize ko, buong buhay ko pala I never had a space that I can call “my own”.

Nung nakikitira pa kami sa family house, isang bedroom lang kami ng parents ko.

Now that we have our own home, share pa rin kami ng kapatid ko ng kwarto.

Nung college, shared dorm ako with 3 roomies.

Ngayong nagwowork, nakikitira lang din ako sa mga relatives ko.

Grabe, lagi kong iniimagine yung sarili ko waking up in a peaceful room with huge windows at maganda yung tama ng araw sa kwarto. Malambot at komportable yung higaan, unan at kumot. May aircon na nag-ooff sa oras na sinet ko. May privacy. May choice ako kung babangon na ako o hihilata muna. Pwede kong idecorate with whatever stuff I want. Pwede kong ayusin sa ayos na gusto ko. Kontrolado ko yung linis, yung space, yung mga gamit, lahat lahat. Sobrang sarap sa pakiramdam, kahit imagination pa lang siya.

Sa ngayon, tamang congrats pa lang muna ako sa mga nagpopost ng solo living wins & journey nila dito. Nakakainspire kayo. I’m hopeful and faithful that someday, darating din yung akin. I’m so excited to also share that milestone with you here. 🥹 Someday!!! 🙏🏼

1my492t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1my492t/does_pure_encapsulations_vitamin_d3_supplement/,Does Pure Encapsulations Vitamin D3 Supplement Really Improve Bone and Immune Health? Review,"Pure Encapsulations B0017QAYBG Vitamin D3 review? Sure thing. With bone health, immune support, and cardiovascular advantages being repeatedly emphasized in marketing, I’ve personally been giving these capsules a daily whirl as part of my wellness routine. Let’s break down the experience.

**Design and Ingredients**  
One glance at the packaging, and it’s clear this is made for simplicity. The bottle is compact, with dimensions of 3.4 x 1.6 x 1.6 inches, making it effortless to stow in a bathroom cabinet or even pack for travel. As someone juggling a vegetarian diet, I often have to scrutinize labels. Thankfully, these capsules are vegetarian-friendly and free from GMOs, unnecessary fillers, and allergens. The unflavored capsule design speaks to practicality – no weird aftertaste here! However, for those who dislike swallowing pills, the size of the capsules might get an eye-roll.

**Ease of Incorporation into Routine**  
Adding this supplement to my day has been seamless. The recommended usage is one capsule, which delivers 125 mcg (5,000 IU) of Vitamin D3. Not sure about others, but I appreciate not having those huge “multi-step supplement instructions.” One capsule, one gulp of water, done. As a night owl often skipping breakfast, this all-day compatibility has been a serious win.

[Check Pure Encapsulations B0017QAYBG price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0017qaybg/)

**Strengths**  
- Vegetarian-friendly composition makes it suitable for a broader audience.  
- Compact and travel-friendly bottle design.  
- High dose of Vitamin D3 supports a variety of health concerns.

**Effectiveness in Target Areas**  
Vitamin D, aka the ""sunshine vitamin,"" often gets overlooked until winter slaps us with its dullness. After spending weeks trialing these capsules, my energy levels felt less ""coffee-dependent."" Importantly, Pure Encapsulations claims this supports bone health, essential for someone like me who's inherited a family history of brittle bones. Oh, and immune health – that’s been a bigger deal with the world these days. The science backs it, with D3 binding to receptors on immune cells, but I’ll admit it’s hard to *feel* your immune system behaving better.

**Drawbacks**  
- Somewhat large capsule size may not appeal to all users.  
- Lacks clear instructions about pairing with meals or other supplements.

**Competing Brands**  
How does it stack up against similar products? Compared to NatureMade or Solgar, which are long-time contenders, this product feels higher-end with its free-from-everything claim. However, rivals like Carlson Labs Vitamin D often have a liquid drop form that’s versatile for those who hate swallowing pills. Still, this product nails it for purists wanting minimal ingredients and maximum absorption in one vegetarian capsule.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
This product leans toward the premium side when compared to some alternatives, but its ingredient clarity and efficacy seem to justify it for those prioritizing quality. The absence of artificial fillers and synthetic extras often found in cheaper pills is a big bonus. Admittedly, I’d hesitate if budget were my main concern, but for long-term health benefits, I can see why it’s worth the splurge.

* Comfort is huge—I’ve tried some over‑ears that downright cook my ears after just an hour, not cool.

In my head, “budget” meant: say goodbye to morning coffee, say goodbye to outings, say goodbye to anything with a bit of fun. Honestly, I didn’t want to live like that.

But when I finally tried it in real life, I was shocked it was the opposite. Budgeting doesn’t take away your freedom, it’s what actually gives you real freedom. When you know exactly how much is set aside for each thing, you can spend without guilt. For example, I now set aside $60 just for coffee shops. The result? I can grab my coffee every week and never feel guilty. On the contrary, I enjoy it even more because I know that money is meant for it.

The best part is the anxiety drops a lot. I no longer have that constant worry of, “Will I make it to the end of the month or not?” Now I know my limits, and I choose where to spend without stress.

If you’ve had the same negative idea about budgeting, trust me try it for just one month and you’ll change your mind.

1my46vs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1my46vs/prep_and_day_0_recap/,Prep and Day 0 Recap,"Hello, all! I know there are countless of posts about people's experiences here, but it was SOOO helpful reading the info here leading up and so I want to give back by trying to share as I go. Thanks to everyone who's given excellent advice through the years.

TL;DR: Do your research, get your support network ready, prep by buying what you need and getting it all set up. Also, Day 0 was pretty decent!

BACKGROUND: My surgery was yesterday! I am 34F and I got my tonsillectomy mostly because of persistent tonsil stones, but have also had strep troubles in the past. I had strep a couple times a year as a kid and then a few times in college. Since then I noticed tonsil stones (a roommate had them and that's when I learned it wasn't normal!) and after each bout with strep, my tonsils became more and more pitted with crypts. Since then, I tell me they've ""disintegrated"" - they just seem like they continue to shred away into these cryptic flaps with more and my hidden stones that would cause ear pain and sore throats. I got some out every few days for as long as I remember. Since one bad 10-day bout of strep that landed me in the ER a few years ago (3 antibiotics later my doctor thought I might have an absess) the problem has caused more pain by stuck stones, radiating into my ear, and causing a sore throat exacerbated by allergies.

My ENT was very receptive to me getting them out - she tried allergy medicines to see if that would help, but also said with my sinus and nose inflammation my tonsils might actually be hurting my allergies, not the other way around, and that with my strep and stones it was worth a quality of life improvement.

Prep is was what saved my sanity! I picked a time that worked for my job, my family, and my calendar. About 3 weeks out I started buying stuff. The week-of I started ""nesting"". Please note that I really needed to research and get stuff in place as a way of coping, so if you didn't put as much time in as me, don't be alarmed!

Purchased items:

*a mini humidifier and distilled water (~$20 on Amazon and water from the grocery)
*2 different throat wraps and a head wrap for the freezer (~$50 total on Amazon)
*extra medicines - bought dissolvable allegra instead of the giant pills I take daily, coated Tylenol, Claritin, Zyrtec, Miralax
*NOTE - these are not advised pre-surgery and are regularly debated on this sub due to levels of blood thinning effects but wanted on-hand in case it ends up being worth the risk: Ibuprofen, Pepto Bismol, CBD tincture, THC lollipops

For food/drink, there's a local food pantry I support and I'm privileged enough to afford it, so I bought a lot of several different things knowing I can donate it if I don't us it:

*pedialyte popsicles bulk pack (amazon)
*Beekeepers Natural kids throat pops (amazon)
*fruit popsicles
*husband prepped me dairy-free protein ice cream (soy milk, protein powder, pudding mix in Ninja CREAMi)
*pudding
*jell-o
*applesauce
*creamy soups
*coconut water (amazon)
*aloe vera juice (amazon)
*kraft mac n cheese cups for microwave
*liquid IV hydration packs
*premier protein shakes (cafe latte so i could get coffee in to avoid a caffeine headache without drinking hot coffee)
*bananas
*avocado cups
*peach cups
*some softer-er-ish things I eat regularly but likely won't eat right away, like Amy's frozen microwave kale pasta bake, Dave's protein bagels, broccoli to bake, eggs, Kodiak protein pancake mix, etc.

Things I arranged that I already had:

*a bedroom to myself with a small TV
*extra random ice packs
*wedge pillow and several extra pillows
*de-cluttered the room as much as possible
*an extension cord and power strip to make everything easier to reach
*table cloth to cover a dresser so I wouldn't worry about spilling things/leaving food cups/etc.
*several insulated water bottles i filled in advance
*a Tupperware container with stuff i wanted to carry around from room to room (tissues, chapstick, thermometer, medicine, throat pops, notecard and pen, empty clear bottle with measurements in case of a bleed, extra charger, etc.)
*put on dark sheets in case of a bleed and put spare clothes and a heating blanket in my room to be safe
*got ahead on chores and made sure my family had what they needed to save them time while caring for me (stocked the fridge, filled pet food containers, filled up on gas, all the laundry, etc.)
*put everything I got to use/eat set up before going to the hospital in the most accessible ways I could think of

Other things I did:

*researched this sub A LOT!
*told a lot of people in advance what to expect - helps keep you from unexpected obligations and explains why you might not text/call/email/talk in public for awhile (also nice to get sweet texts checking in!)
*made a schedule for my immediate support network to make sure responsibilities were covered (kid pickup/dropoff/practice/playdates/clothes/homework and talked w/teacher, work tasks, pet schedule, husband's job, friend events, etc.)
*put the hospital numbers in case of a bleed in my contacts with a quick notes on doc name/surgery date in case someone else had to call
*flashlight in the bathroom to check out my throat
*packed an extra sweater, a filled 64 insulated water bottle, and wore comfy clothes to the surgery

DAY 0 (YESTERDAY):

My surgery wasn't until 12:45 so knowing I'd be very thirsty/hungry/get a caffeine headache, I ate late, had 64oz of water starting at 10PM, and drank ~1 cup of coffee right at midnight. I also wasn't permitted to take my meds in the morning so I took an extra allergy pill at midnight, too. Saw some people I love in the morning and went in! I didn't get called back until almost 1:30, but quickly got my pregnancy test, pre-op questions, IV, BP cuff, and pulse ox. It wasn't until 2 that I saw the anesthesiologist. She ordered me a scopolamine patch but I have never been nauseous at all with anesthesia and love rollercoasters, so I changed my mind last minute when my husband told me how weird your vision can be and that your mouth gets dry.

Surgeon came in around 2:15 and explained what an awful time I'd have! Thanks, buddy. I was his 11 surgery of the day! I went back around 3 with a funny and energetic duo. Versed hits me fast so I was getting sleepy after 3 minutes and the last thing I remember was mostly scooching my body onto the surgery bed - I don't even remember my head hitting the pillow!

I remember waking up right around 4 - I was groggy and very shiver-y, and could definitely feel the discomfort but wasn't overwhelming. No nausea at all. After about 5 minutes (I recover very quickly) they gave me my first dose of pain meds and a popsicle and ice water. I could feel pain meds start to kick in after ~40 minutes. I was told I didn't have adenoids so it was just my tonsils. By that time they'd wheeled me back to be with my husband for discharge. Got more water, peed, and left!

Some observations: my tongue was (and still is) swollen and funky, especially out the sides. It's funny to see. It kinda gets stuck between my teeth. I was dizzy standing up. I also burped a lot in the first hour or so, which my husband and I giggled about. I know it's the easier time of recovery, but I was pretty relieved at how ""not bad"" I felt.

Meds:
*liquid hydrocodone 7.5mg + acetaminophen 325 every 4 hours (my surgeon told me to crush up another 325mg acetaminophen pill and add to each dose) - I only have 5 days worth so I plan to have my husband call to order me more, assuming I need it then
*liquid amoxycillin 5mg 3x per day (the kid nostalgia!)
*liquid prednisone (start day 3)
*my normal meds (3 are pills I can't crush, sadly)

Getting home:

Thanks to construction it took us 45 minutes to get home. I could talk and was pretty upthe.  I was drowsy getting home but stayed awake. Checked in with my family and friends by text. My parents brought over a card and balloons and left it inside for me - so sweet! Right away I ate some vanilla pudding - so good! Tried plain applesauce, but BOY OH BOY is it weird to have certain things down in those holes. Sensory nightmare. I've read folks saying certain things get ""stuck"" (people have to put lots of butter or oil on eggs/mashed potatoes/mac n cheese) but was surprised with applesauce. Pedialyte popsicles are the winner - it literally says you can have dozens of them a day, and that's dosed for child hydration, so they're my new best friend. I also ate a diced peach cup and a banana, both of which felt fine. I had a couple pudding cups and a protein shake later.

I drank water constantly! I set alarms for my med schedule. I watched TV (Alien: Earth is pretty sick so far, y'all) and got all the last minute things set up, like a little med station. I ground up several tylenols and put them in individual glass containers to dump into my hydro for ease of access overnight. I did try it in pudding first but the grittiness and taste was way too noticeable for me and felt like it got stuck to my throat.

Unfortunately it's 11am the next day and I've slept MAYBE 2.5 hours. Dogs distracting me and knowing I have to wake up and probably general anxiety kept me up. I hope to sleep more today. But that meant I stayed very hydrated. Constantly peeing. The humidifier seems awesome. Took all my meds on time. Brushed my teeth before bed and after waking.

Observations:

 I haven't felt nauseous at all. I stopped talking around 8pm, it just started to bother me. Probably should not have talked before then. I took a wicked photo of my throat pretty early on, I am obsessed with it lol - I will spare you all, but it's gruesome and awesome. As someone who has looked at my tonsils almost every day for as long as I can remember, I now have black and white craters! My uvula got a little burnt and my tongue was still swollen, and the swelling around my tongue and throat continued to get worse.

By 10pm my uvula and tongue were pressing against each other, so it just makes eating and drinking feel extra strange and sometimes like things get ""stuck"". I can't naturally see my throat anymore, but can press down my tongue with a toothbrush. TMI but I haven't pooped, although I don't feel like I need to. Will take miralax tonight if I still haven't. Pain meds don't seem to affect me much in general from my last surgery experience, so I didn't have the usual nausea/constipation issues last time either.

There has definitely been a very slow but steady trend into more discomfort, but nothing too bad. Throat swelling seems to be the worst and the ear pain is noticeable. The ice wrap helped last night. I notice my jaw wants to clench (not abnormal for me) but anytime I go to drink it feels like I need to ""unstick it"" and get my tongue separated.

On a positive note, I noticed allergies a lot yesterday morning before my surgery despite having plenty of meds in my system. However, I feel like I've never in my life breathed through my nose so much! And I only took one pill last night that is my least effective anyways. I've always been a mouth breather and also have asthma. Maybe nose breathing is why my jaw doesn't know what to do! Even with a wildly swollen throat area, I am cautiously giddy to think how much this might improve my daily life once I heal.

CONCLUSION:

I plan to post more updates if I feel up to it to cover what ends up being helpful/unhelpful at different stages and what decisions I make along the way! I know this absurdly long and detailed, but the long posts helped me the most to feel like I had all the details covered.

Happy to answer questions/send nasty throat photos! Feel free to point out things I ought to add. Will not give advice on whether you should have this procedure or not because I am not a doctor :) Thanks again to all the folks who've posted before me!",3,1755962394.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

Sure, their job is to promote and influence, but is it really necessary to dismiss or look down on those who can’t afford what this place offers? Worse, suggesting that those who can’t join in don’t have the “right” to speak up feels both insensitive and exclusionary.

This kind of attitude pushes away the very people these “influencers” claim to represent and reveals a clear elitism that says more about their own values than the community’s. Sure, hindi madali tumayo ng business, hindi lang basta-basta ang sources, etc. I’m not blaming or shaming the owners, but in all honesty, it is really pricey for most locals given the minimum wage and other economic factors, especially here in GenSan.

True influence isn’t just about followers or fame; it’s about genuinely connecting with everyone in the community. Sana naman huwag mag-resort sa pagiging matapobre. The least these people can do is understand how others think and feel about this. Hindi naman necessary na ipamukha niyong hindi nila afford. Disappointing lang how these locals are dragging other locals—it’s very dehumanizing.

PS. Hindi lang si “Where to Eat in GenSan” ang nagpo-post ng ganyan sa blue app; isali mo na rin yung ibang “co-local influencers” niya.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

To prove my point that this is actually a completely rational way to choose where to live, I built this handye [tool](https://econholic.shinyapps.io/CoffeeSlutApp/) that does exactly that.

Rate your coffee standards 1-5 and it shows which Maryland or DC neighborhoods actually match what you want. I scraped Google reviews and Reddit posts about DC coffee shops in the past 12 months, then built a text analysis model that score how ""hipster"" each place is based on what people actually say about them. Covered 33+ shops as of now, but will be adding more soon!

The scoring works pretty well. If you are a ""coffee is just fuel/gas"" person it will guide you toward average places. If you are a coffee sl#t, and is the type who debates extraction ratios, it knows to send you to Georgetown or Silver Spring. Also, I tested it on myself (i.e. a level 4 coffee snob) and it reasonably identified my people in the Shaw/Eastern Market area.

Anyway, figured other people might want to use this to justify their housing decisions. Will drop the link if anyone's interested:

What do I do???,"Hi everyone! This whole ordeal has been literally keeping me up at night, so I’m in desperate need of advice. Thank you in advance!

Some background: My ex (28M) and I (27F) have a decade of history. Casually dated (2yrs) > close friends (3yrs) > seriously dated (5yrs.) First mature loves, best friends, lived together, combined purchases, meshed friend groups, really close with his family, planned to get engaged within the next year, all the things. We ended up breaking up over financial difficulties, but no love lost, and planned to get back together when things got sorted out. Thing is, we couldn’t make ourselves stay apart, and we were on and off for the entire next year, which of course, resulted in things getting toxic, and we officially called it quits for good this June. 

I moved back to our home town & decided to go back to school to get my MS in an unrelated field than I’m currently in. Along with classes, I also accepted a job 2 weeks ago in the field to gain relevant work experience. I’ve been super excited, and tbh, it’s the only thing preventing going into a total spiral. 

WELL that was until 5 days ago, when I found out/saw a picture of him and his new gf. Definitely didn’t think he’d move on so fast. Shes a childhood friend, I’m talking toddlers, so ouch. Andddd then the real gut punch: her job is not only in the same field, but it’s very close to the same job, in the same suburb, and quite literally 5 mins away from mine. 

The suburb isn’t exactly large. The chances of living in the same apt, going to the same grocery store, gym, coffee shops, etc. aren’t slim. BUT THEN it hit me. It’s not just her I’m likely to run into. The commute between mine and my ex’s city is only 2.5 hrs, so I’m positive he’ll visit her often. I’m still deeply in love with him, and I really think seeing them together would make me absolutely lose it. Tbh, i’m already on the brink of it lol. 

I’m also convinced it’ll seem like I’m doing all of this purposefully & it makes me feel so creepy. My grad school is online, I havent signed a lease in that area, and my start date isn’t until next week. I’m genuinely considering withdrawing my acceptance and look for jobs in another city. I’m upset to possibly allow this to derail my plans, but I’m so worried that going through with it will be detrimental to my mental health.

Now a decade later I am a full time artist, but this Baahubali fan art is my most favorite one.

Many a times I think, had I not made this art, what would my life be like? Well, I don't like the answer.

Honestly I don't even know what his standards are for when it's time to wash a dish. Depending on what he last ate he may or may not rinse them, then stacks them neatly at his spot. He almost NEVER washes his coffee cup, which literally makes me gag when I see it. I try to encourage him to use the black coffee mugs so I can't see how bad it is. If the kids or I wash one of his dishes (usually when we can't stand looking at them anymore) he actually gets mad! And if one of us has a dirty dish and he hasn't eaten yet he'll take that one as opposed to getting a clean one. 

Occasionally he does the same to us, ""here use mine...."" Last night I finally exploded and told him it's disgusting and no one wants to eat off of someone else's dirty plate/bowl/utensil. And we don't want to look at his dirty dishes all day either. He got offended and said we're all wasting water and energy because we won't reuse dishes. ???

Says it's due to over-stimulation because of his ASD,"Context: we've been together for 15 years. We have a 6yo son. Our son is quite full-on and can be hard work. We're awaiting an ADHD assessment because this kid, although he's delightful and very bright, barely sleeps and operates at 100mph when he is awake. Also he's not good at following instructions and he has a tendency to do the exact opposite of whatever you tell him to do - he can be quite trying sometimes! Although I love him and he's wonderful! 

My husband was diagnosed with autism after our son was born. 

We both work full-time. My husband is the main earner and he earns double what I do. I did previously have a better paying job but I quit to get a more flexible job that was more family-friendly. I now work from home full-time. Hubby works from home 3 days a week and has to go to the office twice a week. In theory my husband finishes work at 4.30 but he usually works until 6pm or until I call him for dinner.

I do all the school runs, school lunch prep and I cook dinner every day. I also do all the morning routine. 

My husband sleeps in every day. I haven't had a lie-in for years. On workdays, husband wakes up when he needs to for work and not a moment before. At weekends he sleeps in usually until at least 10am, often until lunchtime. Whereas our son is an early riser and it's always me that gets up with him! I do all the school preparation routine, and at weekends I'm up making breakfast and playing with him or doing chores. My husband will sleep in, then shower and have a breakfast and coffee etc by himself before he joins us.

When I've spoken to him about this he says he can't help it because he just has a different sleep schedule to us. I've said that's absolutely fine but can be do something at a different time of day e.g if he has a lie in at the weekends can I have a ""lie out"" and a few hours to myself while he does bedtime. But actually, it's also me doing bedtime usually by myself! I also suggested can he take our son to the park for an hour or so after he gets up so I have time to myself. But he always finds an excuse as to why he can't do that. Conversely, when I take our son out in the morning without waking my husband up, my husband gets annoyed that we went without him! 

I know he can get up because he gets up for work every day. And when we had friends visiting recently, he got up and made breakfast for them. 

The only time I get to myself is when I go to the gym twice a week, but I always put our son to bed before I go. 

My husband has said I can be controlling about our son and that is why he leaves things to me. And maybe he has a point. But I don't really feel like I can leave him to parent solo because things have often gone wrong when I have. Hubby loses his temper quite quickly and will not just yell at our son but fully scream at him. And once he poured some water on him after our son bit him (I know biting is bad but who is the adult here?!). 

Additionally, once when I left him to do bedtime while I went to a class at the gym, I got back at 10pm and hubby was asleep on the sofa while our son was awake playing Xbox by himself. Hubby hadn't got him in pyjamas or made sure he brushed his teeth or anything. Also once I went to get my hair cut on a Saturday and hubby didn't make lunch while I was gone, he said because our son didn't say what he wanted to eat. Now I do my appointments during my lunchtime from work.

Hubby is completely addicted to his phone which he says he uses to regulate due to autism. But he is almost always looking at it and both me and our son need to repeat ourselves several times when we're talking to him. He's on it all day long including at the dinner table and didn't take kindly to my suggestions to have screen-free dinner, or put phones in a box sometimes when we hang out. 

As well as this he doesn't do a lot around the house... I mean the daily stuff like the dishwasher, cooking, cleaning is all me. 

I feel honestly like a single parent. I'm seriously considering divorce. But my husband is very upset about that and says he's been crying himself to sleep every night because I don't love him any more and that he will change. The thing is he has tried to change several times, but it never lasts. He has been diagnosed with depression and sought help but it's been several years and nothing has changed.
    
Hubby does get time to himself and I'm always encouraging him to attend gigs (he has been to 3 so far this year including nights away in a hotel each time) but he doesn't really have any friends of his own, he says I'm his only friend. I try to encourage him to hang out with his family but he reacts poorly because I'm ""trying to get rid of him"" 

Also, when we're both sick for example when we both had flu recently, hubby will take to his bed whereas I'm still carrying on as best I can. 

We had a good relationship before we had our son, I think, but since then it feels like I'm married to a man from a 1980s sitcom.    ",25,1755961855.0,relationship_advice,33,0.86,False

My name is Sam, and I think my roommate is dissecting things in his bedroom.

That’s a strange sentence to write. It sounds like the beginning of a joke, or something you’d say to a resident advisor to get a room change. But it’s not a joke, and I can’t tell anyone. If I was wrong, I could be in trouble for defamation. And if I was right… could he come after me?

His name is Julian. We were assigned to each other by the university’s housing algorithm, a process that apparently saw two aspiring doctors from different sides of the state and thought, “perfect.” 

For the first month, it seemed to be right. We got along. Not in a best-friends-for-life kind of way, but in the easy, functional manner of two people whose ambitions are perfectly aligned. Our lives were a shared rhythm of lectures, late-night study sessions fueled by cheap coffee, and the mutual, bone-deep terror of the gigantic metabolic pathways in biochemistry.

We were both in the same gross anatomy lab, Section B. That’s where I first noticed Julian was… different. The lab is a rite of passage, designed to weed out the weak, or so they say. It sure is easier for our generation, raised with unrestricted internet access, the shock wears off fast. We’ve seen it all before, filtered through a screen. The first time they roll back the sheet on your cadaver, there’s a jolt, a smell, a sudden confrontation with mortality that no video can prepare you for. But you adapt. It becomes clinical. It becomes work. Well, at least, until you see the first babies. The fetal specimens, floating in their jars of formalin, perfect and pale. That’s the thing that gets under your skin. That’s the thing that reminds you that this isn’t just a puzzle of flesh and bone.

Most of us coped with a kind of gallows humor, a clinical detachment that felt like a suit of armor. We gave our cadaver a nickname, “Alfred"", and we spoke about him with a forced, professional respect that barely concealed our unease.
Julian needed no such armor. He approached our cadaver, a frail old man whose skin was the color of old parchment, with a focus that was less clinical and more… reverent. His movements were precise, economical, almost beautiful. While the rest of us fumbled with our scalpels, making ragged, uncertain cuts, Julian’s incisions were clean and perfect. He seemed to know the landscape of the human body before he’d even opened the textbook.

“He has an anatomic variation on the origin of the vertebral artery,” he’d murmured one afternoon, his voice a low hum of concentration. He was pointing to a vessel deep in the neck.
Our TA, a third-year med student named Chloe, came over. She peered into the cavity, her expression skeptical. “No, that’s standard. It’s branching from the subclavian, right where it should be.”
“Look closer,” Julian said, without looking up. “The root. It’s a few millimeters too high. It’s a common variation, but it’s there.”
Chloe looked closer. She pulled out a probe and gently shifted the tissue. Her eyebrows shot up. “Huh. You’re right. We wouldn’t have even gotten to that for another two weeks. Have you been reading ahead?”
Julian just shrugged, a faint, almost imperceptible smile on his lips. “I like to be prepared.”

That was when the others started to notice. He was always prepared. He knew the name and function of every nerve, every muscle, every tiny, insignificant foramen in the skull. He didn’t just study the body; he seemed to understand it on an intuitive level, as if he were recalling something he already knew. His fascination wasn’t just academic. It was personal.

The weirdness at home started subtly. A new lock on his bedroom door. His habit of showering at odd hours, always after midnight. And then, the smell.
It was about three weeks ago. I came back from a late study group, the dorm hallway quiet and smelling of stale pizza and air freshener. As I got to our door, I noticed another scent underneath it all. A chemical sharpness that made the hairs on my arms stand up. Formalin. I told myself I was imagining it, that I was just carrying the scent home from the lab on my own clothes, my own skin.

But the next night, it was there again. Stronger this time. And it was definitely coming from under Julian’s door. I knocked. The soft sound of movement inside stopped. I knocked again.

“Julian? You okay in there?”
A long pause. Then, his voice, muffled. “Fine, Sam. I'm just studying.”
The smell was gone by morning. But it came back a few nights later. And the night after that. It’s become a part of our apartment’s nocturnal atmosphere now. The low hum of the refrigerator, the distant sound of traffic, and the faint, sweet, sickening smell of a morgue seeping from my roommate’s locked room.

Last night, I heard a new sound. I was up late, cramming for a physiology exam, when I heard a noise from his room. It wasn’t loud. It was a soft, rhythmic scraping. A wet, precise sound, like a knife being carefully drawn through something dense and yielding.

I’m not going to the RA. What would I say? “My roommate studies too hard and our apartment smells like our anatomy lab”? They’d think I was crazy, or just trying to get a single room.

But I’m sitting here now, in the quiet of our living room, and the sun is starting to come up. Julian’s door is closed. The scraping has stopped. But the smell is still there, clinging to the air like a ghost. And I’m starting to think that whatever he’s preparing for, it has nothing to do with saving lives.",1,1755961716.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1my3vvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1my3vvs/does_the_cuisinart_dcc3200bksp1_coffee_maker/,Does the Cuisinart DCC-3200BKSP1 Coffee Maker Deliver on Its Promises? Review Inside,"**Stylish and Streamlined Design**  
The Cuisinart DCC-3200BKSP1 Perfectemp Coffee Maker immediately impressed me with its elegant black stainless-steel finish. Sitting on my countertop, it looked sleek and modern, blending beautifully with other kitchen appliances. It’s slightly larger than I anticipated, with dimensions of 7.75""D x 9""W x 14""H, so it’s worth considering space if your kitchen’s tight. I’ll say this much—while its size caters to brewing up to 14 cups, the machine does feel a little bulky in smaller spaces. The glass carafe with its stainless-steel handle lends a premium touch, making it both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

**Convenient Features for Coffee On-Demand**  
Morning coffee never felt simpler. Fully programmable, this coffee maker lets me set brewing times up to 24 hours in advance—which is perfect for those groggy mornings when pouring water feels like a chore. The optional ready alert tone saved me more than once, letting me know my bold brew was ready before I even entered the kitchen. Even better is the Brew Pause™ feature that allowed me to sneak a quick cup mid-brew. While brewing a full pot proved seamless, I found the 1-4 cup setting particularly handy over the weekend when I didn’t need multiple rounds of caffeine.

[Check Cuisinart DCC-3200BKSP1 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b077k9yw7d/)  

**Good Aspects**  
- The programmable timer simplifies busy mornings.  
- Multiple brew strength settings (Regular and Bold) cater to different tastes.  
- Brew Pause™ lets you pour coffee mid-brewing without ruining the process.  

**Flavorful Coffee Every Time**  
Having tested both brewing strength settings, I noticed a genuine difference between Regular and Bold. I lean toward a richer coffee flavor, and the Bold setting truly enhanced the depth in every cup. The brewing temperature was spot-on; I never experienced lukewarm coffee—a common issue I’ve found with cheaper machines. That said, some users might find the pre-programmed settings too mild or strong based on personal preference.

**Easy Maintenance and Filtration System**  
Cleaning is rarely fun, but Cuisinart makes it bearable. The self-clean function requires minimal effort—just add water and let it do its thing. The machine won’t leave you guessing when to descale either, as the indicator light serves as a helpful reminder. Additionally, the gold-tone coffee filter and charcoal water filter worked well in ensuring my coffee was as fresh as possible, even when using regular tap water instead of filtered water.

**Shortcomings**  
- Larger in size, so unsuitable for compact kitchens.  
- The loud alert sound at the end of brewing could be irritating to light sleepers.  

**Competing Brands in Perspective**  
Comparing this coffee maker to others like the Keurig K-Elite or Ninja CE251, there’s a trade-off between versatility and capacity. Unlike the Ninja, which limits you to 12 cups, this machine stretches that to 14 cups—a clear advantage for bigger households. On the flip side, Keurig machines excel in single-serve convenience but fall short in delivering as refined or customizable a flavor. For batch brewing without compromising quality, this model feels well-balanced.

**Cost Efficiency**  
It’s not the cheapest coffee maker, but the feature list significantly justifies its price point. Features like programmability, customizable brew strength, and self-cleaning functionality make it reliable and worth considering over more affordable, less durable options. If you're someone who drinks coffee daily and values consistency, it's tough to beat this product in the long run.

Since the start of the year she’s mentioned a guy that she talks to who randomly gave her some sort of swimming fins a few months back.  She’s talked about him many times since, mentions details about his wife and kids and what he does for a living.  He recently suggested they have a coffee together after swimming instead of by the poolside.  To her credit she said to him “what would your wife think” and he said he would ask her.  He then asked my wife for her phone number.  Later on she got a text from him with a photo of himself with his wife and she was holding up a sign that said “yes to the coffee”.  We actually joked at the time that maybe they were swingers.  So to be clear She told me all of this and was upfront about it and they then set a day to have a coffee.  She said she was feeling a bit weird about it but didn’t want to be rude.  The day came and went and she told me it was a little weird and awkward and they had a conversation about kids and he talked about his work.  She made it sound like she was glad it was over and done with.  Next day she told me she got a text suggesting his daughter and ours could say hi to each other because they had briefly studied a subject together but had not met.  This was several weeks ago now and she has barely mentioned him since.  She almost always tells me about her day, the people she works with and the people at the pool so because she hasn’t been mentioning this guy i assumed she’s barely seen him.  When she did mention him she said he’s changing jobs and won’t be swimming there for much longer and this is about all she has said about him in weeks.  Fast forward to last night and my wife walks in to the room with a beach towel she’s at some point been given as a present that has pineapples all over it and because of the association with pineapples and swingers she made a joke that she better not take it out in public.  I suggested she take it next time she swims laps and she said “funny you should say that”.  I said what do you mean and then she told me the guy she’d had a coffee with has told her he is infact a swinger.  She made it sound like this was a conversation had pool side and she said he actually said to her that he wanted to talk to her about something and it was that he felt they’d been flirting with each other.  She was trying to make a joke about it but included our daughter (20) who was sitting in the couch in the conversation so i wasn’t comfortable to ask more questions.  Next day I thought about it and thought it was a weird conversation to have in a public swimming pool so asked her outright if he really said all that between swimming laps and she then said no they’d gone for a coffee.  Further questions and i find out this is infact the third coffee they’ve been for.  Given she told me the first time and i know she 100% would not be even slightly comfortable with me meeting someone at a pool and going for coffee and given she always talks about her day i find it very strange she has been out two additional times for coffee with this guy that she initially said she felt weird about meeting up with. And she hasn’t even told me.  It also turns out she’s been txt’ing him as well.  Apparently on this third coffee trip he said he felt they were flirting with each other and she says she told him she wasn’t flirting bit she’s joked with our stepchild (30) who she showed the photo to and they said it looked like some meme about swingers (after we’d already made a joke about that).  So she basically said to him she’d joked they were swingers and he told her that actually that was correct.  They then went on to have conversations about how him and his wife meet people on redhotpie, that his wife first suggested it, that she’s less happy with it now because the women are always more attractive than the men, about how he’s also met just single women and he’s actually bumped in to one at a party once and had to pretend they’d never met.  Quite a long involved story about it.  The fact him and his wife are swingers doesn’t bother me.the fact she went on the initial coffee trip doesn’t bother me as she told me about that.  The fact shes gone on two additional trips and also been txt’ing the guy and the fact he thought they were flirting (i personally always know if someones flirting with me so feel she must have said some things to give him this impression). I feel she only eventually told me is because she’d told my stepdaughter that she was correct when she joked about the swinger thing and she probably then thought I’d hear it eventually.  I’m feeling a bit suss about her secret meetings.  She’s tried to deflect or redirect and say that i go for coffees with women i work with however this is not actually something i do very often at all and it’s litterally something like we’ve been to see a customer, walk out the door and there’s a coffee shop and we’ve had a coffee but we are collegues that work together not randoms who met swimming laps at a pool. Anyway should i be feeling weirded out by this and upset that she hasn’t told me that for weeks she’s had txt conversations and additional meetups?",1,1755961447.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.6,False

1my3rpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BangaloreSocial/comments/1my3rpt/dating_in_bangalore_whats_working_for_you_what/,"Dating in Bangalore: what’s working for you, what isn’t?","I (30F), born and raised in Bangalore, would describe myself as someone who enjoys good one-on-one conversations, good food, and maybe long walks. Recently single, I find myself wondering how people are meeting people in the city anymore.

For context, I have dated since my early 20s. Before Tinder, there were blues bars and coffee shops where I organically met very interesting people, but now, a decade later there are no bars that have the old Bangalore vibe and it feels like the city’s nightlife has only overly drunk party scenes to offer (I have had my fair share of this too, and not judging the people who prefer this)

Coffee shops are mostly filled with people glued to their laptops (I’m guilty of this too), but not very many people are open to free flowing conversation between strangers anymore (or are wearing wedding rings haha)

Then came Tinder (and subsequently Bumble), which was great in the early dating life because it presented the opportunity to meet new people and learn or explore what I wanted from life and love.

What is online dating like in Bangalore for women currently? I met my ex on Hinge two years ago and we went on to have a lovely relationship. But in hindsight, luck played a role in that and not just algorithm.

I have been to singles mixers in the city and while I met fantastic women, at the risk of sounding quite harsh, rarely met men with whom any real connections happened. What I found more often than I’d hoped was social awkwardness, lack of engaging conversations, ostentatiousness, or leftover baggage from previous relationships/marriages.

I’m at a point in my life where I am quite content with myself, and am seeking to meet people who can be enriching to my life (mutually, of course. I am not arrogant enough to think it is a one-way street), and I think I am justified in seeking a connection with someone who has broad perspectives, comfortable in conversation, independent, and capable of carrying themselves well. (Is that too much to ask for, ladies?)

TL/DR:

I’d love to hear how others are navigating the dating scene in Bangalore (especially North Bangalore) — what’s worked for you, what hasn’t, and if there are any hidden gems I might be missing.

It’s about a teen girl in a world taken over by a new street drug,From what I do remember it was about this teen girl whose parents either died or lost custody when a new drug was released to the streets. I think the drug started with a Z but I’m not positive. She was found and kind of “adopted” by this older guy and they live in an abandoned church. The older guy teaches her to fight and she has to practice everyday. When she was younger it was either her best friend or brother and she had found him by a dumpster in an alley and he was overdosing on the new drug that I believe some guy forced him to take. I don’t remember a lot like I had said because I never fully finished the book and had lost it and forgot about it but I remember her going on a bus or subway train to possibly go to school. I also remember she noticed this guy was popping up where she would go more frequently and I’m pretty sure right around the time I stopped reading it she had coffee with the guy. There also might be something about a place with a bunch of shipping containers where she followed some guy and I think someone got shot but I’ve read so many books that could be a detail from another book I read around the same time. I do remember there being something about school but I don’t know if it was that she had to go or couldn’t go or if she had to go to a specific school or follow specific rules at school. But besides the best friend that died of an overdose I don’t think she really had any friends. I’m also pretty sure she went on a walk around the block and a building was on fire and she was really fascinated by one firefighter in particular and I believe that’s the guy she sees more often and has coffee with.

The next day, the boy woke to the sound of laughter. Uncle Sam sat sprawled on the sofa, his long frame almost swallowing it, while two police officers lounged beside him, laughing so loud it pulled the boy from sleep like a hand dragging him from water. He rubbed his eyes, each motion slow, hesitant, as though awakening fully would make the world collapse.

When he entered the living room, the officers held steaming cups of coffee or was it tea? their hands loose, casual, yet their laughter carried an edge he couldn’t place.

“Your dad’s funny,” one officer said, a grin cutting across his face.

“I’m his uncle,” Uncle Sam corrected, voice flat, calm, unbothered.

“Oh… that makes more sense,” the first officer chuckled. “My uncle was hilarious too.”

The boy stiffened. “What are you guys here for, anyway?” His voice cracked slightly, betraying the tension coiling in his chest.

The first officer’s face twisted into gravity. “Oh… it’s horrible.”

“Just horrible,” the second officer added, his voice carrying an unnatural weight.

“What happened?” the boy snapped, the question sharper than intended. Uncle Sam’s head tilted slightly, his eyes tracking the boy, unreadable, calculating.

“Six teenagers,” the first officer said slowly, as if the words themselves were knives. “Camping in the woods nearby… stabbed. More than fifty times.”

The boy’s stomach churned. “Jesus…” he whispered, a dry, rattling breath leaving his lips.

“How far from here?” he asked, his voice lower, more controlled.

“Ten yards, maybe,” the officer replied. “At least.”

The boy’s heart thumped violently, a horrid bubbling twisting inside him, cold and hot at once. Sweat gathered on his forehead; he shoved it away, tried to hide it, wiping the droplets with his elbow in a desperate, unconscious maneuver. But the officers’ words seemed to lodge themselves in his skull, a static hum behind his eyes, matched with heavy, ragged breathing that he could almost feel vibrating through the air. That gnawing ache the one that had been sitting quietly in his chest for years now filled his head entirely, pressing against the wrinkles of his brain.

“We better get going now,” one officer said, voice normal, casual, breaking the spell.

“Yeah, better get to it. Gotta lotta work ahead,” Uncle Sam replied, his tone steady, controlled.

“Nice meeting you, Samuel,” the first officer said, extending his hand. Uncle Sam took it with a slow, deliberate grip, shaking firmly.

Silence fell after the officers left, the echo of their boots fading into the distance.

“Crazy, ain’t it?” the boy muttered, eyes darting toward the spot where the officers had been.

“What?” Uncle Sam’s voice was calm, almost hollow.

“The teenagers… the ones who got stabbed. Crazy, ain’t it?”

“Oh… yeah,” Uncle Sam said, voice flat. “Horrible.”

The boy didn’t move. His heart still throbbed violently in his chest, the residual echo of their presence filling the room like a shadow he couldn’t shake.

Uncle Sam retreated to his room, leaving the boy alone in a pit of sweat, a storm thrashing violently in the back of his pupils. His chest heaved, but no tears came. The boy sat rigid on the sofa, thoughts twisting endlessly, looping over themselves like barbed wire in his skull. The wrinkles of his brain seemed to constrict with every passing second, mirroring the tightening of his fingers, the balling of his palms, the coiling of his arms each movement a desperate attempt to bury the enormous weight deeper into his stomach. He had been doing this for so long that the hours slipped away unnoticed; soon, night fell over the cabin like a heavy, suffocating shroud.

Uncle Sam must be sleeping, he told himself, eyes fixed on the basement the godforsaken basement, dark and forbidden. A place he was never allowed to enter. Uncle Sam would never… he would never…

A voice hissed in his mind, panicked and rising, echoing off the walls of his skull.

He didn’t do it…

He didn’t do it…

HE DIDN’T DO IT!

The words reverberated, vibrating through every nerve, until his thoughts became a hammering rhythm. His body tensed, his heart raced, and the storm inside him refused to relent, a tempest of fear, guilt, and something unnameable twisting him from the inside out.The boy tried desperately to drown out the terror clawing at the trenches of his soul. He stood, trembling slightly, and approached the basement. A black, suffocating darkness loomed before him, vast and unwelcoming. Each step down the rickety stairs was measured, cautious his toes testing the floorboards as though they could betray him.

CREEEEK.

The long, agonizing screech of a floorboard beneath his weight jolted him violently, sending sweat dripping down his spine and plunging him further into despair. Panic knotted in his chest as his eyes caught a thin, dangling string swaying silently in the darkness.

With tentative fingers, he tugged it. A weak, yellowish light flickered to life, cutting through the oppressive black like a trembling beacon. The light revealed a crudely fashioned door, embedded awkwardly into the side of the basement wall.Dust clung thickly to the concrete floor, coating his shoes in powdery gray. The wooden walls loomed like silent sentinels, empty yet whispering with the ghosts of forgotten things. The basement was barren, yet it seemed alive, holding its secrets close, daring him to uncover them.

The boy pushed the door open, letting it click shut behind him, and stepped into a dimly lit cell-like room. Shadows clung to the corners, bending and twisting in the pale light. He carefully descended the stone steps, each footfall deliberate, echoing faintly against the polished surface. Surprisingly, the room below was clean, almost meticulously maintained.

A small television sat in the corner, surrounded by stacks of DVDs. A bookshelf, orderly and unassuming, stood nearby. Yet the boy’s attention was drawn elsewhere a faint, almost imperceptible sound, a ripple of noise that didn’t belong to the hum of the TV or the quiet of the stone walls.

He scanned the room, heart pounding, trying to pinpoint its origin. Slowly, he pressed his ear against the bookshelf.

The sound that greeted him twisted something in his chest. A baby’s wail, sharp and raw, cut through the silence. Beneath it, there was something else a deeper, more guttural sound, violent and ragged. A sobbing voice, or maybe multiple voices, wracked with grief or agony, filling the space with a weight that pressed against his ribs, making it hard to breathe.The boy’s skin crawled. Every instinct screamed at him to flee, yet some thread of fear, or curiosity, kept him frozen against the shelf, listening, absorbing the unbearable sorrow that seemed to seep through the walls themselves.

The boy’s breaths began to overlap, shallow and rapid, each inhale and exhale colliding against the next. Sweat poured from his forehead, dripping to the floor like a leaking faucet, slicking the cold stone beneath him. Panic clawed at his chest, but a strange compulsion drove him forward.

He began yanking books from the shelves one by one, stacking them haphazardly, then returning them, over and over, his fingers trembling with urgency. Finally, a single book resisted the shelf, holding steady. He pushed against it, and half of the bookshelf swung open, revealing a dark, gaping entrance.

The cries hit him then shattering, raw, and unbearable. The sound seemed to tear at his chest, vibrating through his bones. Heart hammering, he stepped inside.

There, in the dim light, a woman appeared. Pregnant, familiar her face etched into his memory, yet horrifyingly altered by pain. She had six babies, each wailing violently, their tiny screams piercing the air. Her own sobs were loud, ragged, and unrelenting, each one a blade cutting through the room. Scars and bruises mottled her skin, maps of suffering and torment that spoke louder than words ever could.The boy froze, paralyzed between recognition and horror. The room seemed to shrink around him, every breath a struggle against the cacophony of cries, the weight of despair pressing on him like stone. He wanted to run, to scream, to tear the scene from his mind but something held him there, trapped in the undeniable reality of what he had found.

“Are you… Sam’s daughter?” the boy asked, his voice trembling.

The woman nodded, and her tears poured like an ocean from her eyes, spilling down her bruised cheeks.

“PLEASE… TAKE MY BABIES! PLEASE, GOD, TAKE MY CHILDREN! LET US OUT OF HERE!” she screamed, her voice jagged and raw, echoing off the stone walls.

The boy pressed a trembling finger to his lips. “He’s going to hear you… I’m… I’m so sorry. Just… please, whisper.”

“Please… take us. I’ve been here for years. I don’t even know how old I am… please,” she begged, her sobs rattling the floorboards.

Panic struck him like a hammer. Sweat poured from his temples and clung to his skin. He clasped his hands over his chest, feeling his heart hammer wildly, bouncing up and down like it wanted to escape. Anxiety carved itself into the tight wrinkles of his brain, making each thought scream louder than the last.

“I… I will,” he whispered, his voice strangled, deprived of air, each word clinging to his chest as if the very act of speaking might tear him apart. “I will come back. I promise.”

With trembling hands, he shut the hidden bookshelf door, retreating upstairs. Each step back felt heavier than the last, as if the weight of what he had seen followed him, rooting itself into his chest. Once in his room, he worked frantically to remove all evidence of the hidden chamber, shoving books back into place, trying to erase the nightmare he had uncovered.

The next morning, he sat at the kitchen table, cereal in front of him, fingers twitching nervously. Uncle Sam chewed loudly, oblivious, while the boy’s mind raced, haunted by the cries and the desperate faces of those he could not yet save.

“Hey, kid… you seen my pistol?” Uncle Sam’s voice sliced through the quiet kitchen like a knife.

The boy didn’t answer.

“Kid, my pistol! Where is it?” he snapped, the words snapping in the air like twigs underfoot.

“I… I can’t tell you that,” the boy stammered, his throat tight.

“Where is my gun?” The words hit harder this time, bouncing against the walls of the small kitchen.

Silence lingered, heavy and thick, pressing down like wet cloth on the boy’s shoulders.

“Upstairs… in my room,” the boy finally whispered.

“Where in your room?”

“The… closet,” he said, each word fragile.

Uncle Sam muttered under his breath but left it at that. Soon after, the two returned to their breakfast, the awkward tension dissolving only slightly into the sound of cereal being eaten. Uncle Sam scooped up a large, soggy handful and, between bites, said, “What do you think… some sort of badass or something?”

He laughed, a rough, booming sound, before shoving another bite into his mouth.

The boy hadn’t touched his cereal.

“What’s wrong with you? Eat your cereal it’s getting soggy,” Uncle Sam snapped.

“My bad,” the boy muttered, dipping his spoon hesitantly into the bowl.

Uncle Sam rolled up his sleeve, revealing a rectangular watch for a split second before covering it again. “I gotta go,” he said casually, walking toward the basement with the ease of a predator moving through its territory.

The boy’s gaze lingered over the dark shadows at the basement entrance, long and quiet, as Uncle Sam disappeared into the hidden cellular.Down below, the faint scent of dust and mildew clung to the air. Uncle Sam’s boots echoed softly against the concrete floor as he approached the bookshelves. His brow furrowed in confusion as he shifted one volume, then another, something had shifted.

Up above, the boy hovered in the doorway, cloaked in the delicate shadows, straining to hear.

POP! POP! The shots tore through the air like jagged lightning, rattling the walls and shaking the floor beneath him. The kid froze, a prickle crawling up his spine, his heart pounding so violently it felt like it might burst through his ribs.

He darted his gaze wildly toward the exit, the stairs, the shadows every corner a potential threat. His chest tightened, lungs burning as if the air itself were conspiring against him.

Panic clawed at his mind. He bolted upstairs, slamming the uncle sams bedroom door behind him, the echo of each shot still hammering through the house. His fingers shook uncontrollably as he yanked open drawers, tore through closets, desperate for a weapon anything to defend himself from the chaos downstairs.Below him, the floorboards groaned under the weight of unseen movement. The basement seemed alive, exhaling slow, menacing thuds that echoed through the house like the pulse of a monstrous heartbeat. Every creak, every whisper of movement was amplified in his mind, twisting the shadows into shapes that lunged at him.

A cold sweat ran down his back. His palms were slick, trembling over every surface, as if the walls themselves were closing in. The shots had stopped but the silence was worse, heavier, suffocating, broken only by the faint, deliberate scrape of something or someone moving far below, waiting.The kid’s breath came fast, ragged, slicing through the tense stillness. He felt trapped in a storm of fear, the house twisting into a labyrinth of dread. Every second stretched, stretched, stretched until it felt like the basement was no longer beneath him but everywhere around him, watching, waiting.

The kid cowered beneath the bed, pressed so close to the floor that every creak of the wooden planks sounded like the world itself was cracking apart. Dust motes floated in the slivers of light, but they were almost invisible to him, swallowed by the oppressive darkness. Each shallow breath felt like inhaling smoke, sharp and choking, as if the air itself wanted to crush him.The boots came first slow, deliberate, thudding against the floor with an intent that made the entire room vibrate. Each step was a hammer blow to the pit of his stomach. The walls leaned inward, dark corners stretching like claws, shadows thickening until they felt alive, crawling toward him.

“COME OUT!” Uncle Sam’s roar shattered the fragile silence. The sound didn’t just echo it slammed into the kid’s chest, rattling his bones and leaving a ringing in his ears that drowned out everything else. The floorboards groaned under the weight of Sam’s approach, creaking and whining like the house itself was warning the boy.

The kid’s pupils expanded to their limits, terror paralyzing him. Every instinct screamed to bolt, yet there was nowhere to run, only the narrow, suffocating prison of the bed.

Then the shadow fell. Uncle Sam’s looming figure stretched across the floor, immense and immovable. The kid could feel the cold brush of the rifle’s metal as it swung lazily, a silent predator, waiting. And then the teeth the great, unnerving white teeth, spread into a grin that radiated malice, gleaming even in the dim light, sharper than any knife.

A hand clamped down on the kid’s scalp. Iron. Pain. Terror. His scream ripped out, raw and wild, bouncing off the walls, swallowed by the shadows. The fingers dug in, lifting him off the floor with inhuman strength, as the bedframe groaned in protest beneath them.

“SHUT UP!” Uncle Sam bellowed. His face was close enough for the kid to see the cruel flex of muscles, the twitch of a vein on his temple, the gleam in his eye that promised absolute control. The room seemed to shrink around him, the air thickening, pressing against his chest, squeezing the oxygen from his lungs. The shadows stretched, elongated, coiling around the bedposts and walls, as if they, too, hungered for him.

The kid’s body quaked, every nerve screaming, fingers clawing at the floor, searching for anything, anything to hold onto. The house itself felt alive the walls breathing, the floorboards whispering warnings, the air vibrating with the echo of Uncle Sam’s fury. Every heartbeat pounded like a drum of doom, each second stretching, elongating, suffocating.

And all the while, that grin the white, predatory grin never left, as the kid dangled helpless, terror pouring into him like molten fire, filling every hollow of his being.

The room was no longer a room. It was a cage, a predator, a living nightmare and the boy was trapped inside, every inch of him consumed by the presence that could crush him without effort, that could end him with a flick of a hand.

The kid lashed out, fists hammering into Uncle Sam’s stomach, each strike met with a deep, hideous laugh that seemed to echo through the walls, bouncing like jagged shards of metal. Pain bloomed across the boy’s knuckles, burning and raw, but he refused to stop, driven by some impossible mixture of fear and defiance.

Then the cold, unyielding butt of the rifle slammed into his gut, and he crumpled against the floorboards. The wood groaned beneath their combined weight as Uncle Sam pressed him down, his immense body pinning the trembling boy in place. The kid flailed, arms and legs swinging like a headless chicken, each movement only tightening Sam’s grip, crushing him into the floorboards, forcing the air from his lungs.

“Why?” Uncle Sam’s voice cut through the chaos, sharp and ragged, almost pleading. “Why do you do this to yourself? Why does everyone trust me, yet I’m so lonely, so empty, no matter who’s with me? Why?” His hands dug into the floor beside the boy, bracing, every muscle taut. His eyes burned with something unnatural, a mixture of rage, despair, and hunger.

“Why do you want to trust me?” he continued, voice dropping to a low, dangerous rasp. “You know I’m not human. I don’t think I ever was. Everybody knew… nobody cared.”

The boy struggled beneath him, each breath a scream trapped in his chest, the floorboards splintering under the weight and fury of their collision. Fear, confusion, and something darker an understanding he couldn’t yet name twisted in the pit of his stomach. Every flail, every punch, was swallowed by the sheer, suffocating presence of Uncle Sam.

And in that crushing, unending moment, it became impossible to tell where the boy ended and the terror began.

Uncle Sam snarled, the sound tearing through the night like metal scraping bone. Then he smiled, and it twisted into a laugh a hideous, alien sound, more scream than mirth, echoing across the deadened landscape. The air itself seemed to shiver in terror at it.

The boy had reached the end of the road. The road that had carried him through fifteen short, shattered years had abruptly ended at the edge of a still, black lake. Every heartbeat pounded in his chest like a funeral drum, each gasp of air tasting like ash.

Without hesitation, Uncle Sam seized the boy, his massive hands unflinching, merciless. The cold night air bit at his skin as he hurled the boy’s naked body into the dark water. The lake swallowed him immediately, the surface rippling once before smoothing into an impenetrable black mirror. No scream lingered. No struggle remained. Only silence.The boy was gone. Forever lost, a shadow erased from the world, leaving nothing behind but the echo of a laugh alien, unearthly, and utterly final.

He never sleeps. Uncle Sam never trust him, kids. He’s not human, and he never was. He contains that of flesh and bones, but something deep within is anything but human. He never sleeps. He is there in the light and hides in the darkness. You may know him, you may not, but always remember: Uncle Sam never sleeps.

Problem is i dunno which one to pick and currently in analysis paralysis mode. I mainly ride a GTS and love it, also not a big range guy. most of my trips are just coffee/bagel runs, or short 3-10 mile joy rides and usually stick around 17-21 mph.

I have a Pint that I can rewheel but haven't because of laziness and it does what I need it to when I do ride it.

Was wondering if anyone has ridden a rewheel'd pint and how that compares to a PintV or XRV.

I've been wanting to mod my Pint or my XR with the XRV to try it out but been a bit hesitant for a couple of reasons. Mainly the issue is if I get the XRV, I'll get the curiousity bug and eventually want to upgrade the battery. But if you pick up the XRV + Indy speed control plug and play kit, price wise you're not far from a fully built X7.

Also was wondering if anyone had thoughts on the XRV/PintV vs Thor 301 (or whatever Fungineers uses) on fire risk. Main reason I've been on the fence with VESC is because it seems the main reason they're ""stronger"" than FM is they allow you to push more current & FM puts a governor of sorts on their boards. My thinking is FM probably runs very conservative settings to optimize to reduce fire risk. (IMO less current = less electricity running through the system so there's a lower chance of something going wrong). So was just wondering if the thor301's were safer than the floatwheel kits.",3,1755960898.0,onewheel,5,0.8,False

Food for thought in regards to how different types of existence come with different ""rules"" and experiences. This is very fun and liberating in astral but somewhat sad that irl you don't just walk up to people and instantly manhandle them by smooching them and pestering them into friendships with you just like that. People would rightfully feel horrified and assaulted x'DDD however in astral, you wanna hug? Someone will absolutely give you one. You want to ""pester"" someone? Here, have all of the entities that would love to hang out without judging. It's hilarious xD

Today I attended some kind of a large party where I was following an old friend of mine around. One of the entities there was telling me to stop following my friend and instead follow him. I told him I'll consider it for next time.   
  
Next I went to practise some ""magic"" that I'd learned in astral the last time I visited. I'd noticed previously that it's hard to manipulate the shape and nature of objects and items around you. You're definitely a lot more of an observer than you are a ""creator"". I noticed this as I tried to make coffee appear in my hands but failed, then I tried to make a muffin wrapper into a coffee cup and failed again. Coincidentally I asked to learn magic one time, and it took me to a group of women that started teaching me this ""transmutation"" stuff that I'd been attempting on my own. Since then, I have an easier time manipulating object size x'D so I walked around, making all of the food items around me at the party MASSIVE. Everyone around me including my friend, seemed really amused by this and came to eat the snacks that I'd made bigger. 

At some point during the party, an entity stopped me and told me I shined as brightly and warmly as the sun. Seemed like a kindred spirit, we stood and chatted for a bit. Through this encounter I found out that my soul was apparently over 6000 years old. I also was shown that we all have markings on us which ""tell our age"" if you look close enough. I will explore this more in future astral adventures. 

And one more fun thing, I walked past some unconscious entities (what I mean by that is just people that were asleep and wandering astral unconsciously), one of them had been followed and hurt by a very violent/aggressive entity which I simply waved away and it dissipated. I told the rest that they were in a dream and that they're safe. What amused me by this is how easy it is to dismiss unwanted entities when you're conscious. You simply dismiss them. Wave them away. At least in my case. But as I'm someone that genuinely believes I cannot be hurt, maybe that's why it's so easy. 

Regardless, I had a lot of fun today and not only are my projections very vivid, but I'm managing to maintain them for longer and longer periods of time. They feel like they last at least 15-20m. I haven't tried counting the time in astral, it just feels long. And I can simply keep going back even if I feel like I'm ""waking up"". I pick up just where I left off for the most part. 

The only dilemma I have now is, with how often I project, I NEED IDEAS OF WHERE TO GO IN THE FUTURE. Need to sit down and write an extensive list so I never run out of things to do!",2,1755960394.0,AstralProjection,1,0.75,False

1my3cix,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1my3cix/explore_the_best_cold_brew_coffee_maker/,Explore the Best Cold Brew Coffee Maker KitchenAid Delivers,"There's something about the KitchenAid KCM5912SX Cold Brew Coffee Maker that caught my eye from the start. Maybe it's the sleek brushed stainless steel design, or perhaps it's the promise of rich, full-bodied cold brew right from the comfort of my fridge. As someone who's all about coffee (iced, hot, you name it), I decided to give this cold brew coffee maker a spin. From setting it up to pouring out my first batch, I've had quite the experience, and there's a lot to unpack here.

**Functional and Stylish Design**  
This coffee maker fits effortlessly into my kitchen aesthetic. Its brushed stainless steel finish paired with the glass carafe looks modern and professional, like something you'd see in a café. Despite its sturdy appearance, it's surprisingly compact with dimensions of just 8""D x 7.2""W x 8.48""H. It tucks neatly into the fridge without monopolizing space, making it ideal for apartments or small kitchens. The built-in tap is a fantastic addition, allowing me to dispense coffee directly into my glass without having to clumsily pour from the carafe. Plus, the carrying handle makes it portable, so it’s easy to move from the fridge to the counter.

**Ease of Use**  
Making a batch of cold brew with this machine couldn’t be simpler. Add coarsely ground coffee to the reusable stainless steel steeper, pour in cold, filtered water, and plop it in the fridge. The steeper even has handy fill level indicators, so there’s no guesswork involved. After about 12-24 hours of steeping, I had smooth, rich coffee concentrate ready to go. I appreciate how it eliminates the need for disposable filters, which not only saves me money but is also better for the environment.

[Check KitchenAid KCM5912SX price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b07g4w8s7k/)

**Good Aspects**  
I noticed several features that make the cold brew maker stand out:  
- The 38-ounce capacity means I can create up to 19 servings of coffee concentrate in one go, which stays fresh for up to 2 weeks in the fridge.  
- It delivers consistently smooth and bold coffee, perfect for my morning routine or as a refreshing pick-me-up during the afternoon.  
- Cleaning is a breeze. Most parts are detachable and easy to rinse, and the stainless steel steeper is reusable, which is a huge plus for sustainability enthusiasts like me.  

**Critiques**  
There were, however, a few hurdles that I encountered while using this coffee maker:  
- The glass container, while attractive, feels a tad fragile. I constantly worry about accidentally knocking it over in my crowded fridge.  
- The stainless steel tap, while convenient, does feel slightly stiff during use. At times, I found myself needing a bit of force to ensure a steady flow of coffee.  
- The brewing time is lengthy. While I understand that cold brewing inherently takes time, the minimum 12 hours can feel like an eternity when you’re craving a batch of cold brew.

**Performance and Flavor**  
This coffee maker isn’t just about appearances—it excels in delivering a rich, robust cold brew experience. The concentrate it produces is impressively smooth and mellow, without the sharp acidity you'd typically associate with hot brewing methods. Pairing the concentrate with milk or ice is a dream, especially on scorching summer days. Mixing ratios are straightforward (usually 2 ounces of concentrate to 6 ounces of milk, water, or ice), and I can adjust it to suit my taste preferences. It's also worth noting that the coffee stays fresh for up to two weeks, thanks to the airtight seal of the carafe. That’s one less thing to think about during a busy week.

**Product Contenders**  
Comparing the KCM5912SX with other cold brew makers like the OXO Cold Brew Coffee Maker or Toddy Cold Brew System, this one feels more robust in build quality. However, the Toddy system comes with a less fragile plastic carafe, which some might find more durable for everyday use. The OXO coffee maker has a similar streamlined look but lacks the built-in tap—a feature that makes the KitchenAid version incredibly convenient. While all three produce excellent coffee, the KitchenAid’s stainless steel and glass construction might appeal more to those prioritizing aesthetics alongside functionality.

**Cost Efficiency**  
The price point of this coffee maker puts it in the premium cold brew category, but for good reason. Its efficient design, smooth coffee output, and reusable features justify the cost compared to cheaper alternatives that might not last as long. Investing in this product saves money in the long run if you’re someone who habitually buys cold brew from cafés. In my case, I appreciated how it provided café-quality coffee at home without the recurring costs.

I picked cinema: a few shorts on borrowed gear with crews made of friends and strangers, every shooting day like walking into headwind with sand in your teeth, until COVID hit and the set lights just went black — filming turned illegal, festivals went quiet, call sheets died in my inbox, and I felt like the train to film had already left while I was still on the platform with a tripod and a bad coffee.

Disco Elysium didn’t save me by miracle; it did something smaller and weirder, where Kim became a north arrow — boring on purpose, the kind of boring you can live beside — and Harry turned into a mirror that returns your warps whether you like it or not, so in Revachol I felt a safe version of responsibility: you say a line and the world answers, you stay silent and a door shuts, tiny cause-and-effect loops that felt therapy-ish.

I dont have a grand theory for why a game can pull you out; what I have are scraps, like the night I picked Empathy and the guy in front of me stopped posturing and my chest finally unclenched, or the time I failed a check and laughed at myself for the first time in weeks, and those moments added up into practice — being a person without risking the people around me — while the inner voices I already have got timbre and vocabulary, not a miracle but a handle, something you can talk to instead of being dragged by.

Philosophy helped too: in Revachol my pain stopped posing as an exception and became just one case inside a bigger argument — class, exhaustion, a past that wont stay buried — and standing next to other stories, even fictional, mine looked less like “broken” and more like “one of many.”

Climbing out wasn’t a march; it was a hundred small, stupid-looking choices that only make sense in hindsight, and yes I relapse and get socially winded fast, but I’ve got tools now, because art stopped being a shop window and turned into a workshop, and while film needs an expedition and permission slips, games let me live a story with the audience and make them co-authors: I can light scenes how I want, move actor-characters, and record the anims myself with janky mocap in a room stuffed with blankets — not pretty, workable.

I lost titles and maybe a career, but I found work where the inner voices quit being static and learned to act like a navigation system, and I found a way to talk to people who feel strange and “not right,” like I did in a communal flat where a cartridge console was the only door out.

So I carried that into my own game: no neutral narrator, only inner voices and characters, the task framed as self-study rather than puzzle-solving, and the player looks for their answers inside a small, almost stage-like world where every yes and no has weight.

With a lot of effort — and, frankly, stubbornness — I built a team; we put existentialism and transhumanism in the center next to the boring daily question of how to stay yourself in an unfair world, and from the wreck of a ship called Icarus grew Vanzuvar, a jungle settlement under an endless sunset, where the protagonist — an anthropod made by an AI named Cell — opens their eyes and has to learn what “choice” even means and why it keeps circling back to yourself.

I cut the scope for months, tightened the lore, and built a cyber-village that behaves like a stage—depth over size, consequence over flash. That’s how [Locus Equation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2243310/Locus_Equation/) came together. Aiming release for next year.

Disco Elysium didn’t perform a miracle; it taught me to breathe when it hurts, decide when I’m scared, and listen for a decent voice when its too loud inside, and then I did the only thing I really know: turn a fracture into form, so if you feel cold and empty tonight, grab anything that gives you agency — sometimes that’s enough for the night to outlast itself.

Looking to hear from other people's experiences with the two resorts, wedding or not.  

  
Our wedding party is not going to have many kids at all. Maybe 2-3, so we would prefer a resort that typically doesn't have many children but still allows them.

  
Our biggest concern is the cost for our guests. So we are looking to get the best bang for buck experience for our guests. 

After that our priorities are as follows. 

1. Great Pool Scene
2. Room Value 
3. Food & Coffee 
4. Liveliness and Entertainment. Not looking for a sleepy resort.
5. Ambiance & Service  
6. Good Wedding Planning Team

And then he appeared in my restaurant (we did chat long time ago on Grindr), just the man I manifest - with mullet, love outdoor, camping,travel… So I reinstalled grinder, we get in touch and went for a first date 2 days after and was super cute - coffee and lying in park, some kisses and few hours of chatting. Seems it went more then well and over next week I’ve been given breadcrumbs from messages and finally not responding any more. 
I’m not sure if the pain is because I won’t meet him again or just the anger because I want to know the reason -why?
I did such a things before and I do regret now when I felt it on my skin - karma comes alone and mybe I did need this treatment to understand it.

This is three years’ worth of stuff, excluding empties.)

I didn’t include all of my experiments in this review because tracking down old descriptions for those was basically impossible. If you spot something in my picture that piques your interest, just ask and I’ll happily break it down for you!

Now, a little about me before we dive headfirst into this perfume review: I have endometriosis, which means I get hot flashes a lot and my hormones are all over the place. I feel like it makes perfumes project louder while shortening their wear time because I am *warm* all the time. My skin also despises citrus with a deep, toxic passion. Orange smells amazing, but nope,it just refuses to stick.

My true loves are gourmands, petrichor, and green scents. (But let’s be real, this review is about 80% gourmands because Alkemia kills it with the layered gourmands they create.) I’ve been proven wrong before, but I tend to stay away from pine, powders, rose, and honey scents.

This review is split into three categories: *Monthly Alchemies, Experiments,* and the *Regular Line*. Anything with a **\*** is a re-buy, which means it's a certified favorite! Not all of them are hits, but I tried to highlight the notes I felt would come through better on other folks!

# 

# MONTHLY ALCHEMIES (Freebies)

**Queen Bee** (July Alchemy 2023) - *Golden honey, red roses, wild star jasmine*

Right out of the bottle, this is pure golden honey domination with its thick, sticky sweetness! The rose petals provide a powdery, soft undertone while jasmine contributes sweet white floral soapiness. Unfortunately on my skin, that honey goes full medicinal mode, almost cough syrupy and reminds me way too much of the Vicks honey cough meds. As it dries down, the honey does transform into darker amber undertones and the rose softens, but it's not enough to save it for me.

*Wear Time*: Lasts 4-5 hours with the floral/honey vibes fading into dark amber halfway through. It's not a bad perfume by any means, but that honey note just doesn't work on my skin!

**\*Fairy Floss** (August Alchemy 2024) - *Cotton candy, heliotrope, night-blooming jasmine, mandarin twist, vanilla orchid, ethereal musks*

GUYS. My heart breaks knowing this isn’t a regularly carried perfume!! The heliotrope adds this sweet but not cloying marzipan note, while jasmine provides the nicest sweetest floral that compliments a soft cotton candy base. On skin, it's a more pronounced cotton candy with clean, non-cloying sweetness. The heliotrope emerges but fades quickly to jasmine creaminess, and then... WOW. The dry down transforms that cotton candy into soft skin musk with the orchid creating silky depth. The sweetness becomes intimate rather than projecting, wrapping close to your skin.

*Wear Time*: 3-4 hours of pure magic. This is my ideal ""sweet but grown up"" perfume! (I do wish it lasted longer, but the scent is worth it to me!)

**Alchemy of Desire** (July Alchemy 2025) - *Jasmine, gardenia, rose, heliotrope, carnation, rosewood, musk*

The rose absolutely EXPLODES when wet! Gardenia adds a powdery layer with soapy undertones, while jasmine and heliotrope shimmer in the background as pink powder and sweet vanilla notes. As it settles, the florals dissolve into this creamy skin base where the rosewood provides depth. Unfortunately, this was way too soapy and rose-forward for my taste!

*Wear time*: 4 hours of florals gradually softening into a skin-hugging finish that just wasn't for me. Well blended for sure, but not my style.

# 

# 2025 EXPERIMENTS

**Experiment 14 – Everything Rhymes With Orange** \- *Orange glitterati candy, bubblegum, conversation hearts, coconut taffy, lemon drops, red licorice sticks*

Orange hard candy dominates and creates this chaotic sweetness that makes me want to go back for multiple sniffs.. On skin, you get an intense gummy candy note with a lemon citrus-sugar opening, then fruity candy clouds emerge with subtle coconut undertones. It's light, playful, and so much fun! As it dries, coconut taffy re-emerges and red licorice peaks through as the intensity fades.

*Wear Time*: 3-5 hours of noticeable candy presence before fading to this delicate gourmand whisper.

**Experiment 9 – Cherry Bombe** \- *Black cherries, cherry pie, cherry cola, chocolate-covered cherries, cherry nougat, candy cherry balls*

Dark cherry concentration with chocolate and cola sweetness, it's a rich cherry exploration! Bright cherry candy hits immediately with the cola fizz that provides sweet layered depth (the cola is SO strong on me, but in a good way!). The chocolate-covered cherries disappear pretty quickly, but as it dries down, the cherry softens as a sweet powder takes center stage.

*Wear Time:* 5-6 hours with a gourmand base that transforms into a soft powdery skin scent.

**Experiment 7 – Is the Cake a Lie?** \- *Red velvet cake, frosted vanilla angel cake, caramel coffee cake*

Apparently, the cake IS a lie. Unfortunately, all I get is cinnamon incense rather than the expected cake notes. Heavy cinnamon incense dominates completely, overwhelming any cake elements throughout the entire wear. It continues as sweet, heavy incense without any cake development and has this spicy fall candle undertone that really sticks around.

*Wear Time:* 6-8 hours of this before fading. I'm hoping more resting time will help develop those cake notes, because right now it's definitely not living up to its name! (Original rest time: 1 month)

# 

# 2023 EXPERIMENTS

**\*Experiment 8 – Orange Dreamsicle and Banana Taffy** \- *Swirled creamy banana orange*

This has total creamsicle vibes with banana cream swirls, so sunny and nostalgic! Banana dominates immediately with creamy candy sweetness, while orange fades quickly (typical citrus behavior on my skin, *sigh*). The dry down keeps that banana with gentle taffy sweetness and subtle musk base.

Wear Time: 4-6 hours of candy gourmand presence with banana focus.

**Experiment 7 – Jasmine, Ice Cream, Currant, Pumpkin** \- *Pumpkin ice cream with fruity floral lift*

Bright jasmine provides a floral opening while pumpkin adds creamy sweetness without being spicy or fall leaning. The currant adds this dark fruit burst that keeps everything interesting and layered. As it dries, pumpkin creates this creamy base while jasmine maintains airy floral presence with subtle fruit undertones.

*Wear Time:* 4-5 hours before becoming a soft and sweet skin scent with continued complexity.

# 

# REGULAR LINE

**\*Chocolate Noir** \- *Very dark rich chocolate with creamy facets*

Dark chocolate with 85% cacao intensity, blended with creamy full fat milk... YES PLEASE! On skin, it's liquid dark chocolate flooding your senses, bitter cocoa powder mixed with melted chocolate and cream. Rich without being cloying at all. The dry down becomes silky ganache with cream undertones that's absolutely divine.

*Wear Time*: Only lasts 3+ hours which breaks my heart, but those hours are INCREDIBLE!

**\*County Fair** \- *Cotton candy, kettle corn, fried dough, candied apples, saltwater taffy*

Buttery kettle corn pops first with this amazing salty sweet contrast. Then fried dough adds yeasty warmth, while taffy and candied apples provide a brief bright sweetness before dissolving. The dry down sees that butter from kettle corn becoming a creamy base while funnel cake provides another layer of fried sweetness. This mellows to an airy, nostalgic vanilla warmth.

*Wear Time*: 4 hours of pure childhood nostalgia!

**\*Cherries of the Night** \- *Black cherries, maraschino liqueur, cherry amber, musky amber, spiced rum, nutmeg, Peru balsam*

Alcohol soaked cherries burst with dark fruit intensity while rum provides deep liquor warmth and amber creates this golden underglow. The combination feels intoxicating and sophisticated! As it settles, cherries mellow into amber-resin base where Peru balsam adds vanilla smoothness. Musk and spices create sensual warmth that radiates from skin. Never turns gourmand and leans slightly masculine.

*Wear Time:* VERY strong and long-lasting at 8+ hours with rich, sultry presence that maintains complexity throughout!

**\*Black Magic Woman** (DISCONTINUED and my Holy Grail) - *Devil's food cake, dark caramel, blackberry brandy, black plum incense, dark amber, labdanum, black rose petals*

Rich chocolate cake with dark berry juices bleeding through is the first thing that hits me, this is EVERYTHING! Caramel adds dark sugar depth while rose petals provide this unexpected clean sweet base rather than typical rose powderiness. Moist chocolate cake dominates with dark caramel ribbons, while brandy-soaked blackberries add tartness. Rose incense creates this dark but not powdery, subtle floral backdrop that's absolutely gorgeous. The dry down sees amber and labdanum creating warm resinous base while those rose petals become velvety dark burgundy rather than bright pink powder. Berries maintain presence throughout the entire wear.

*Wear Time:* Powerful projection for 8+ hours with complex evolution. (I'm so sad this is discontinued!!)

**\*Ghost Fire** \- *Ethereal white ambers*

Clean, transparent ambers without any heaviness, airy yet present! On skin, it's just pure white layered ambers that are fresh and ethereal. The dry down stays fairly similar to the bottle smell, but holds a strong skin presence the entire time.

*Wear Time*: 8+ hours of ethereal presence that projects strongly. Excellent for layering with literally everything!

**Fireflies in the Garden** \- *Honeysuckle, buttonbush, summersweet, Holboellia blossoms, clover grass, green waves*

Honeysuckle provides immediate sweet floral opening while various blossoms add complexity, and grass maintains green freshness throughout. The dry down is this soft green floral atmosphere that captures twilight garden vibes without overwhelming sweetness.

*Wear Time*: 4 hours that projects fairly well on me.

**\*Crimson Light** \- *Musk, spikenard, merlot red wine accord, tannic oak, graphite, black cherries, currants, plums, violets, licorice, black pepper, cedar*

Boozy black cherries and plums open with wine accord while black pepper adds this spicy kick. Violet provides cool floral contrast that keeps things interesting. Cedar and tannic oak create woody base while dark fruit maintains presence throughout the entire wear. (Not as sweet or decadent as Black Magic woman, but they seem related in the scent realm.)

*Wear time*: Long-lasting 7-9 hours of violet richness that evolves beautifully!

**Carnival of Illustrious Hearts** \- *Sugar creams, candied orange blossoms, raspberry cotton candy, rosewater torte, Bourbon vanilla amber*

Perfumed sugar dusts pink raspberry sweetness while orange blossoms add citrus-floral brightness in the bottle. The rosewater adds this lovely green, airy floral note too! On skin, raspberry cotton candy pulls beautifully, and those sugary orange blossoms fade fairly quickly (curse you, citrus!), while rosewater provides floral green airiness rather than heavy rose presence. The raspberries eventually fade, leaving a perfumey vanilla amber base.

Wear Time: 5 hours of gourmand raspberries that evolve into a sweet amber.

**Enchantress** \- *Amaretto, cinnamon, citrus peel, star jasmine, Amazonica orchid, mandorla amara, Bourbon vanilla caramels, guaiac wood, botanical pheromones*

Almond liqueur mingles with warm cinnamon spice while citrus peel adds bright zest in the bottle, the florals provide depth beneath the gourmand surface. On skin, amaretto creates boozy almond note while cinnamon adds heated spice. The citrus peel disappears almost immediately on me (typical!), then jasmine and orchid emerge with a strong white floral. The dry down sees vanilla caramels creating sweetness while a woody note adds a neutral base to balance things out. It smells perfectly fine and has good complexity, but it's just not a favorite, something about the combination doesn't quite click for me personally.

Wear Time: 6 hours of wear, evolving from gourmand to woody.

**Carmen 7** \- *Spiced pear, lychees, pralines, bourbon vanilla, almond blossom, gardenia, jasmine, magnolia, musky amber*

Decadent lychees and pears with a zesty gardenia punch in the bottle, praline richness lingers right behind making this a complex layering of gourmands and florals. On skin, spiced pear provides juicy opening while lychees add exotic tropical sweetness. Praline creates just a hint of nutty caramel richness while white florals buzz a little too intense in the background. As it dries, magnolia softens the floral intensity while amber and vanilla create warm base.

*Wear Time*: 6-8 hours of layered evolution maintaining interest throughout wear!

**Ambre Caramelise** \- *Gourmand ambre blanc caramelized with brown sugar swirls*

Pale amber meets burnt brown sugar in simple but effective combination, clean amber sweetness enhanced by caramel. On skin, amber provides cozy warmth while brown sugar adds caramelized depth with slight burnt edges for complexity. The dry down becomes smooth amber-caramel blend that becomes skin close and intimate, without much projection.

*Wear Time*: 4 hours of comfortable amber presence that stays close to skin and would be perfect for layering!

**Irrésistible** \- *French macaroon accord, bourbon vanilla bean, nutmeg, sweet almonds, caramel, dulce de leche, amber*

Perfect almond macaroon with crisp shells and chewy interior in the bottle, vanilla and caramel provide amazing bakery vibes that had me so excited! Unfortunately, this was a HARD PASS for me. On my skin, it turned sickeningly sweet in a way that never got better, even after resting for months and then a year. I was absolutely gutted it didn't work because the notes sounded perfect, but sometimes skin chemistry just says no! What should have been baked almond shells and creamy caramel became cloying overwhelming sweetness that gave me a headache.

*Wear Time*: 4+ hours before washing it off.

**Luminae** \- *Softly alluring, buttery sweet*

Fresh buttery popcorn with milk undertones in the bottle. On skin, warm skin musk emerges immediately with gentle buttered popcorn notes that finish into smooth cream texture. The dry down is more savory, buttery, popcorn heavy and less sweet / layered than County Fair.

*Wear Time:* 3 hours (shorter than I'd prefer), though it's a pleasant experience and I’ll definitely use the rest of the sample.

**Paradise** \- *Coconut, Madagascar vanilla, hints of Monoi Tiare*

On skin, creamy coconut provides warmth while vanilla adds depth and richness. As it dries, vanilla becomes dominant with coconut providing creamy frosting like undertones.

*Wear Time*: 4-6 hours of a pleasant, sweet, vanilla cloud on my skin.

**Au Lait** \- *Warm milk, tonka, wild honey, caramelized brown sugar*

Creamy milk dominates. The tonka is subtle, while brown sugar provides another layer of sweetness. The dry down sees milk fading as a tonka caramel base emerges, leaving creamy gourmand finish.

*Wear Time:* 4 hours fading to warm, milky skin musk that stays intimate and cozy!

**Frondescence** \- *Fern fronds, wild geraniums, damp moss, green patchouli, vetiver, meadow grass, wetland streams*

Crisp fern fronds provide green freshness while geraniums adds a bright citrus-green floral. Moss and grass create earthy, damp foundation that's so realistic. The dry down sees vetiver and patchouli adding a deep earthiness while maintaining green, wet character throughout.

*Wear Time*: Becomes subtle quickly and only lasts 3-4 hours, but a lovely green scent still.

**Vanille Amour** \- *Madagascar & Tahitian vanillas, tonka, Ottoman spices (cardamom, ginger, Grains of Paradise)*

Rich vanilla provides immediate sweetness while cardamom and ginger create warming spice blend that's deliciously spicy. The dry down sees vanilla and tonka creating a smooth base while spices maintain a strong presence, without overwhelming sweetness. (Very Fall vibes)

*Wear time*: 6 hours of balanced sweet and spicey combination that's perfect for cooler weather!

**Kanu y Med (Song of Mead)** \- *Honey mead, summer berry melomel, sweet briar, citrus blossom water, balsam benzoin, styrax musk, Italian bergamot*

Fermented honey with berry additions and medicinal herbal undertone in the bottle. On skin, boozy honey, while berries add tartness that mingles with medicinal undertones to prevent this from being overly sweet. The dry down sees benzoin and musk creating resinous base while honey maintains presence.

*Wear Time*: 6 hours evolving into subtle woodsy skin scent.

**Kashish** \- *White gardenias, tuberose, night-blooming jasmine, vanilla orchid*

Dense white florals with powdery intensity in the bottle, vanilla provides sweetness to balance the floral power. On my skin though, this was another miss because it went very powdery and soapy on me. Gardenia and tuberose create powerful white floral explosion, while jasmine adds creaminess, but that soapy quality just dominated everything. The vanilla orchid tried to soften things too, but I couldn't get past the powdery vibes.

*Wear Time*: 5 hours of bold white floral presence that just wasn't my cup of tea. I can see others loving this, but it's not for me!

**Center of the Universe** \- *Rum and raspberries, welded metal, gun powder, seared steak, burnt almond cookies, charcoal, ozone*

First impression? Industrial smokiness with unexpected sweet rum-raspberry contrast... this is absolutely WILD! On skin, metallic ozone and charcoal provide a sharp opening while rum-berry sweetness lurks beneath. The dry down sees smoke and burnt cookie elements lingering while a raspberry sweetness becomes the base. It's dramatic and memorable with serious niche appeal. I wouldn't buy it again, but it was such a fun sample to try!

*Wear Time*: 3-4 hours, the perfume was constantly shifting with each sniff, but settled into a raspberry ozone skin scent.

**Cidre d'Automne** \- *Fresh varietal apples with autumn spices*

Fresh apple provides crisp opening while cinnamon and spices add autumnal warmth. The dry down sees apple fading as spiced warmth becomes dominant. Spicy and nostalgic autumn comfort that's perfect for cozy weather!

*Wear Time*: 4-6 hours of fall vibes.

**Kamarasa** \- *Honeyed amber, coconut cream, fig kiss*

Unfortunately, on my skin it really didn't pull any fig at all, and the coconut and honey note created a medicinal sharpness I just didn't enjoy. The amber note was lovely, but that sharp medicinal edge kept me from fully appreciating it.

*Wear Time*: 5 hours of not terrible, but definitely not what I was hoping for based on the notes!

**Caffaeum** \- *Five-year aged black amber, Arabian coffee, labdanum, benzoin*

Dark coffeehouse with aged amber and resinous depth in the bottle, I really wanted to love this one! On skin, bold Arabian coffee provides roasted opening while aged amber adds dark complexity. The resin elements do add staying power and play with the coffee notes, but unfortunately it was very incense-heavy on my skin. The dry down sees labdanum and benzoin trying to deepen things, but that heavy incense and bitter edge never fully mellowed for me.

*Wear Time*: Strong 8+ hours of dark resin presence. Complex, but not experience I was hoping for.

**Miel** \- *Golden honey with beeswax*

Pure golden honey with strong powdery undertones, is what I smell first. The dry down sees honey softening to warm, powdery skin presence. I wish this was a lot less powdery and a more resinous, but as we know Honey notes dislike my skin.

*Wear Time*: 3-4 hours of honey floral presence before fading to skin-close powdery sweetness.

Thanks for sticking with me through this marathon review! Alkemia really knows how to create these layered, complex scents that evolve beautifully on skin.",22,1755959477.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,1.0,False

1my2zg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_partners/comments/1my2zg8/experiencehelp_with_timetaskmood_mismatch/,Experience/help with time/task/mood mismatch?,"Hello everyone! My non dx (in progress) partner and I have always been a bit mismatched concerning how to use or what to do and expect at certain times. It's a bit difficult to explain but I was really hoping you could help me out.

For example, when I wake in the morning on weekends I like to lie in a bit, I'm still, only checking my clock, looking out the window, breathing the air, cuddling into the blanket for a bit and so on. When my partner joins me (separate bdrs) I'd love to cuddle, slowly wake up etc. However, he wants to talk and show me stuff immediately. if I don't want to, he at least wants to read on his phone or worse look at stuff with audio. I can cuddle *at* him but cuddling together is always the last step and one he enjoys too but not half as much as me.
Ironically, after he loves to stay in my bed for some alone time where he can read in silence. I don't mind that part, I like getting up alone and having my coffee, but I hope you can see the lopsidedness still.

Another example is grocery shopping. To him that's so utterly boring that he uses that time to talk to me about any of his current hyperfixations or anything under the sun, just to avoid being ""there"" in the moment of the shopping. This stresses me out like nothing else because I need to focus on the shopping list and where to go and listen to him at the same time which is too much. Additionally, I wouldn't say I enjoy the shopping but I DO enjoy focusing on what I do, on the moment or the task at hand. He wants to rush in, grab what is on the list and sprint out and experience at little of this boring task as possible. To me it's not boring and I want to stand in the produce section and ponder if I'd like to treat myself to a melon or maybe buy berries to change up my daily porridge.


also, I come home from work, he has been working at home for hours at that point, and immediately talks to me for at least an hour about all his thoughts, fixations or emotions. To me that's a time to... wind down, pause and recalibrate for the rest of the day? it's not that he wouldn't give me time for that but that's not what I want. I want to talk to him, I really do, but more measured, less hyper and vomit-y, more on par with the course of the day, I guess? He also keeps talking to me when I'm on the loo, ffs. 


Basically, he is always talking or at least consuming something, mostly videos. He also reads a lot but whatever it is, I haven't seen him do nothing or not look at his phone for longer than 30 in months.

And all of this leaves me exhausted and I feel like muddled into emotional chaos. I don't know if I'm the weird one here but I kinda live along the hours of the day and it's normal flow. He doesn't seem to have this instinct or timeline at all. All he seems to do is flee whatever the time/task currently is by doing something else in parallel, like he doesn't want to feel or heed the moment and would rather spend it differently, preferably by talking through anything in detail or by consuming.

I try to set boundaries and it's very obvious when I'm tired or annoyed but he'll just ask if he's talking too much and passing the decision on if he should continue to me, which I can't stand either because I just want him to be mindful. And even if I say something it hardly ever helps. it's like he registered that I don't want to listen anymore and understands and then keeps on talking and I sit there wondering if I'm nuts because I don't notice any change or adapting but he just registered I need smth different? 
And what's up with coming into my room? I'm hardly ever there and if I am, I'm doing admin at my desk. I'll put in ear buds (which he hates) and close the door. no 5 minutes later he'll come in for any reason, leave and leave the door open. and I'm just like ???? it's like he's forcing me to at least body double in some remote way. idk 

I'm very new to all this and I'd appreciate any help in getting a clearer grip on the situation and tips on how to manage better and get pulled less into his time and mood chaos! 

PS: I'm terrified of him finding this so I may have to delete at some point.

- He easily laughs at my jokes and I mean a full blown laughter and it makes me feel he really enjoys my company 
- He notices me a lot. I know he steals glances at me when I am not looking and notices when I wear new anything (shoes, nails, watches). But it can also be because he is a sneaker-head and a watch collector.
- He never initiates a one-on-one hangout and we don’t text or call because we’re friendly but not exactly friends. All interactions happen between us because we bump into each other at our neighborhood coffee shop.
- He invites me to join their friend group. I am acquainted with everyone because it’s the same neighborhood  It is always him who calls out my name.
- We hung out a few times in the past and I did feel a strong connection and attraction but that’s about it.
- We interact often and maintain strong eye contact. Although it can be his habit, I am not sure. 
- The only time he has broken the touch barrier is because he wanted to take a closer look at my watch so he took it off my wrist. We only shake hands every single time we meet. 
- I have a feeling he likes me and finds me attractive but I have not gotten any solid confirmation so far. 
- He remembers details about me but again idk if it is because he likes me or because he has good memory. ",14,1755959458.0,bodylanguage,29,0.85,False

(Seriously, My Venmo Exploded 🚀)","Okay, can someone *please* explain how this wasn’t insanely popular already? Because my mind is genuinely BLOWN.

Did you know there are real apps in 2025 *literally paying* regular people—like me and you—to test new app features? Not talking about chump change for surveys, either. I just joined a few last week and—GUYS—I made almost $90, for like… giving my random opinions?

Where was this during the college ramen epoch??

So if you’re skeptical (which, same), buckle in. Here are the top 7 legit apps actually paying you to test shiny new features right now in 2025. No fluff. Just what’s flooding my Venmo.

---

- **GoodNovel TestApp**  
  This one is basically the king right now. They drop new updates all the time. You give feedback, do a few click-throughs, and you get *paid* via PayPal or gift card.  
  You can check it out for yourself (!!!): **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
  I found real payment proof all over Reddit and Discord. Crazy, right?  
  (This is the one that stunned me—I thought it was fake until I cashed out on Monday.)

---

- BetaBound  
  It connects testers to a TON of beta apps, from finance to gaming to wellness. If you love trying everything before it’s cool, this is your goldmine.

---

- UserTesting  
  You literally get paid to record your screen and say exactly what you think (even if your thoughts are “ew, who dropped this feature??”).  
  Pro tip: Be brutally honest. They seem to love it.

---

- PlaytestCloud  
  Okay, gamers—where were y’all for this?? You basically get paid to play games that aren’t out yet.  
  If you ever wanted to rage about a tutorial and get money instead of banned, this is *it*.

---

- Pincone Research  
  It’s mainly food and shopping but… they rolled out a new feature-testing branch for 2025. Surveys, digital product feedback, and at least $3 per task.

---

- TryMyUI  
  The instructions are dumb simple. Click through a site or app, narrate what’s confusing, and you get paid—sometimes $10 a test.  
  Plus, they’re ramping up for new AI-driven app launches, so apply fast before it floods.

---

- **GoodNovel TestApp**  
  Can I repeat this? YES! Because legit, it pays off. If you missed the link before, here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
  They want more GenZ and Millennial testers, so the rewards keep stacking up. ️😍

---

Now, here’s what *shocked* me. Most people ignore these because they sound “scammy.” But budgets for feedback are HUGE right now—all these apps are basically bribing us to help them outsmart their competition.

I just want to shout it: Don’t sleep on these!  
Cash a little, complain a lot, and you’re funding coffee for a month.

And one last time, for those in the back: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
If you don’t try anything else, try that one—the payout is WILD.

Anyone else out here making side income from feature testing? Any other secret apps we should know for 2025? Drop your stories and let’s all get that beta-tester bag.  

Also, if you want the literal easiest onramp to paid app testing in 2025, again, here ya go:

1my2xig,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryGiftsf/comments/1my2xig/the_hidden_stairway_of_wealth_is_earning_money/,"The Hidden Stairway of Wealth: Is Earning Money About Climbing, Chasing, or Finally Seeing the Steps Glow?","I don’t know if anyone else feels like this, but I’ve been thinking a lot about this simple, loaded idea of “earn money.” On the surface, it sounds objective—just go work, right? But then suddenly you realize it’s not just about hours, skill sets, or effort. It’s about *perception*, *timing*, sometimes even pure luck. And that has me both excited and confused in equal measure.  

Why does earning money feel like climbing a hidden stairway in the dark?  
Sometimes I find myself wondering if there’s even a staircase at all or just a treadmill where the steps never end.  

Here’s where it gets interesting for me: the old ways versus the new.  

- Old ways = stable jobs, reasonable growth, often capped. (Safe, but slow.)  
- New ways = side hustles, content creation, digital opportunities. (Unpredictable, but can be huge.)  
- In-between = investing, reselling, passive strategies. (Always risky but sometimes rewarding.)  

I stumbled across something recently and it hit me kind of hard because it was unexpected: browsing through **https://goodnovel.org/**, I realized even storytelling and digital content now have direct ways of creating income. And I thought… wait. People are literally monetizing their imagination. Meanwhile some of us are grinding away at jobs and never questioning the ceiling above us.  

**Why does “earn” sometimes look more like “trade your time” while other times it looks like “multiply possibilities”?**  

Maybe the answer isn’t universal. Maybe it’s about aligning with what excites you most. Do you thrive on risk or crave stability? Honestly, that single division seems to dictate which path makes sense.  

Still, there are contradictions I can’t make sense of:  
- Why does one person writing online stumble into financial freedom… while another person pours in the same energy and can’t even get a coffee paid from it?  
- Is it skill? Timing? Audience? Or just randomness pretending to be destiny?  

And this brings me back to my confusion. The rules aren’t fixed anymore—but isn’t that *also* what makes this the most exciting time ever?  
Maybe we’ve underestimated our own ability to be flexible. Maybe the idea of “earn” is supposed to shift with us, generation by generation, level by level.  

At the very least, I do know this: exploring new platforms, stories, and ideas changes perspective—sometimes dramatically. And for me, looking at places like **https://goodnovel.org/** isn’t even about one solution—it’s a reminder that creativity and money might not be separate lanes after all.  

So here’s the real question:  

What if “earning money” is less about *finding* opportunity and more about learning to see the spaces where money already exists, waiting to flow in your direction?  

Until then… I’m left both motivated and bemused. Am I chasing money wrong, or am I just starting to see the stairs light up under me?  

And every time I come back to it, I wonder… maybe the next step is hidden in plain sight, glowing quietly—like scrolling through **https://goodnovel.org/** and realizing the door was never locked.",1,1755959334.0,LuxuryGiftsf,0,1.0,False

1my2sys,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheReviewCircuit/comments/1my2sys/does_milwaukee_262620_cordless_oscillating_tool/,Does Milwaukee 2626-20 Cordless Oscillating Tool Deliver Performance? Comprehensive Review,"The Milwaukee 2626-20 18V Cordless Oscillating Multi-Tool has been a steady companion in my day-to-day projects. As someone who juggles between minor repair jobs around the house and larger DIY ventures, I put every tool in my arsenal through rigorous tests, and this one had to live up to high expectations.

**Versatile Design**

The first thing that stood out was its sleek yet rugged red design. This multi-tool feels compact and manageable in hand, weighing just three pounds — no wrist fatigue even after extended use. It isn’t just stylish; it's functional too, with features like an all-metal gear case that hints at durability. The tool-free blade change system is a game-changer since I don't waste precious minutes fumbling around with screws or levers. Switching from sanding to cutting takes no more than 15 seconds, making the workflow seamless.

**Built to Perform**

From the moment I switched it on, the consistent power delivery became apparent. It offers a speed range from 11,000 to 18,000 OPM (Oscillations Per Minute), ensuring versatility for different tasks. Whether I’m sanding down furniture or cutting through drywall, this tool adapts effortlessly. However, what’s really neat is the 12-setting dial, allowing precise control over the speed, which is especially handy for more delicate jobs like trimming baseboards.  

[Check Milwaukee 2626-20 18V Cordless Oscillating Multi-Tool price on Amazon.](https://tooldetective.com/p/b0ckbzpfst/)

**Enhanced Visibility**

Working in dimly lit spaces like beneath cabinets or in basements used to be a hassle, but the built-in LED light makes it a non-issue. This small yet significant feature has saved me so much time I’d have otherwise wasted squinting or setting up external lighting. It’s such a thoughtful touch that one tends to take for granted until it isn’t there.

**Advantages**

- Cordless functionality ensures unmatched flexibility.  
- Lightweight but durable build.  
- Tool-free blade change simplifies task transitions.  

**Limitations**

- No battery included, so you’ll need to purchase one separately.  
- Might feel underpowered if tackling thicker materials like hardwood.  

**Included Accessories**

The multi-tool comes equipped with handy additions: five sanding sheets, a sanding pad, and a wood-cutting blade. During my tests, these worked as advertised, especially the sanding sheets for refinishing my antique coffee table. Still, investing in higher-quality replacement blades down the line could expand the tool’s capabilities even further.

**Competing Brands**

While testing this against other oscillating tools like DeWalt's oscillating multi-tool or Bosch's variant, I noticed a few differences. The Milwaukee model impressed with its tool-free blade change and reliable speed controls, something the Bosch fell slightly short on. However, the DeWalt version delivered slightly better power for cutting through harder materials, albeit at a higher price point. Milwaukee leans more toward value and versatility rather than outright brute strength.

**Cost-Efficiency**

When considering similar tools in this price range, this cordless oscillating tool balances affordability and functionality quite well. It offers a professional-grade performance without soaring beyond the budget for most casual users and DIY enthusiasts. If you're looking for a cost-effective tool that punches above its weight for various home improvement projects, this one ticks the boxes.

******************
Skylar
6th grade:
I’m walking into school behind my brother and Oliver, one of his best friends. They really don’t pay any
attention to me and only let me follow them to school because Mary makes them bring me. Mary is my
nanny, she has been with me as long as I can remember. My dad is the beta of the pack and really
busy, so Mary was brought on to teach me how to ‘behave like a lady,’ which basically means teach me
to be silent unless spoken to and out of the way of the men. She does nothing of the sort, but my dad
doesn’t know that, as long as I make a good show when he’s around.
My brother spends most of his time with the future Alphas, Cameron and Dakota, the future Delta, Sam
and the future Gamma Oliver. They travel in a group wherever they go, they are almost worse than
some of the girls here.
Mary told him to make sure I got to and from school safely after I came home last week with a bruise
under my eye and scrapes up my arm. I tried to tell her it was an accident and that I tripped, it was not
a big deal, but she didn’t believe me. She knows I have been having trouble with kids at the school. I
live in a werewolf pack that feeds on hierarchy and dominance, of course at some point we are all
going to start trying to showcase our dominance, we’re middle schoolers.
What I have seen though is it’s more the non-ranked kids who are trying to show off for the ranked kids.
They are trying to gain status by being noticed. It’s funny to think that some kids are popular, just for
the rank they were born into, not what they have actually done. Obviously, everybody wants to be the
Alpha’s kids friends. That’s the height of all popularity. My brother, Sam and Oliver aren’t far behind
being rank born. I, however, don’t matter, even though I am the Beta’s daughter and have Beta blood. I
am the reason that my mother is dead, and that is reason enough to shun me to lower than an Omega.
That is why Mary fears for me, she has seen how kids openly treat me and no adult does a thing to
stop it, not even my father.
“Move it fatty. You’re taking up the whole hallway and walking slower than a turtle. Are you sure you’re
a wolf?” Kaley sneers behind me. I just move to the side to try and get out of her way. She sticks her
foot between my legs and I trip sideways head first into a locker not being able to catch myself with my
armful of books.
The crash brings everyone to a halt. All eyes are on me, but the only ones I care about are my
brother’s. He turned to look at the sound and when I made eye contact he just shook his head, rolled
his eyes and turned to walk away, Oliver and Kaley following him. The rest of the kids in the hallway
disperse too, some laughing quietly, others not so quietly, but no one stops to help me up.
7th Grade:
“Don’t you ever question my authority in front of another student again!” Kaley shoulder checks me into
a door leading out to the courtyard in the middle of the school.
“I didn’t question your authority, I told you that you can’t hit kids just because they are in your way. If
you were late, that is not their fault.” I shouldn’t snap back at her, it only fuels her fire, but she’s starting
to get on my nerves. She was late because she skipped second period to go get coffee with her friends
and was late getting back to third period, who happens to be a teacher that will report her to her father.
Although nothing ever seems to happen when she is reported.
I right myself, set my focus down the hallway and move to walk away from the door that was holding
me up, but before I can get two steps, Marnie, one of Kaley’s little minions steps out to trip me, then
proceeds to dump her iced latte on my head. I hear cackles of laughter then others join in, meaning we
attracted a crowd.
I look up to see my brother and his friends joining in with the laughter. “Maybe if you trained a little
harder and lost some of that baby fat, you wouldn’t be so clumsy.” Kaley says not-so quietly to me then,
“Hey boys, are we up for hanging out at the fire pit tonight?” To my brother and his friends.",2,1755958876.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

I have been on a consistent diet for the past two years now and wanted to share my routine in hopes of providing valuable information, motivation, and/or receiving constructive criticism.

I chose to provide this photo to show how my food looks when I pack a meal prep:

* Top left bowl consists of 250g's of steamed vegetables (brussel sprouts, mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, squash, asparagus, bell Pepper, onion, heart of romaine, kale, & spinach), 4.5 Oz. of chicken and one egg (under the chicken, can't see). **ONE CAVEAT**, I alternate the protein in my meals, choosing from 4.5 oz portions of chicken, turkey, ground beef, steak, bison, lamb, salmon, or tuna. My protein options are usually seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika, turmeric, garlic powder, and/or red chili flakes.
* Top right small bowl consists of 80 g's of Kiwi, 20 g's of walnuts/pistachios, 1tbsp of hemp seed, and 1 tbsp of chia seed. **ANOTHER CAVEAT**, I alternate the fruit in my meals, choosing from 80 g portions of Kiwi, Blueberries, Blackberries, Raspberries, Banana, or Mango.
* Bottom square bowl consists of 100 g's of Sweet Potato, 100 g's of Legumes (mix between red beans, black beans, pinto beans, and any lentil), 20 g's of Parmigiano Reggiano, 40 g's of Avocado, 20 g's of Tomato, 20g's of Sauerkraut, 20 g's of Kimchi, 1 tbsp of EEVO, sometimes a tbsp of Balsamic Vinegar, salt & pepper to taste.
* Not in photo but I only drink water (\~150 oz/day) and coffee (one cup about twice a week).

For those interested, here is the macronutrient breakdown per meal (ESTIMATE based on average from multiple sources) - 800 Calories, 57 grams of protein, 86 grams of carbohydrates, 23 grams of fats, & 35 grams of fiber. These meals also meet all my micronutrient RDI's.

NOTE: I do not take any supplements, I am completely ""natural.""

I RARELY deviate from this diet (other than eating out with friends/family which is occasional) and have incorporated cardio + weight training into my life to reach my goals. Please feel free to ask me any questions, I would love to clarify.

It felt a lot more serious than just a crush or passing attraction. But we both liked each other for years. But then 4 years passed from when we met.

I moved hours away to college because my mom had an addiction and home wasn't safe. He didn't know that's the reason I went. One night I was down for winter break, and he immediately asked me if I'd just heard that weird noise too, and then said he'd be very down to see me. I wanted to say yes so badly, but was going back to school the next morning. I told him honestly that I'd love to but I don't live here anymore, I go to school in X city and don't have a car, no transit from home/school either which was all true, and I didn't think I could make it work right now, and I was really sorry. He said no worries but I'm scared he took it as rejection. It wasn't an excuse at all. I just didn't know how to make it work in a way that was fair to both of us and kept both of us safe from my mom who I was still so ashamed of.

It's been 10 years now and I'm finally able to move back safely. And I still want see him. He was always the only one I really wanted and that's not changed for me. My mom has passed away, I have a career, I've taken care of myself, there's nothing I need or want from him but him. I still want to reach out to him to see if he's at all around and interested in that coffee still. I know that when he asked me it wasn't casual based on our connection not being casual and his guardedness. I know he was vulnerable and what it took for him to reach out that night like he did after 4 years of silence.

But it's been so long and his social media is dead - I can see he still goes online but he has changed his profile photo to a cartoon, hasn't posted anything in 10 years, no new photos with anyone, no tagged photos, no relationship updates, etc. I think he stayed in town and didn't pursue post-secondary but I have no real idea.

1my2lln,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1my2lln/does_this_ever_happen_to_you/,Does this ever happen to you?,"Hey everyone,

Just a small anecdote I wanted to share. Every morning I start my day the same way. I grab my special mug, brew my favorite coffee, and take 15 quiet minutes before the chaos begins. It is the one thing I never skip.

But today I walked into the kitchen and saw that the bag was empty. Just a few sad beans at the bottom. I had forgotten to buy more.

Right away I felt annoyed. I complained to myself that the whole day was already off track.

So I put on my shoes and decided to walk to the little café nearby. I was cranky about having to leave the house and talk to people before my coffee.

But once I stepped outside something came over me. The air was cool and fresh. The sunrise painted the sky with pink and orange. My neighbor was out watering his roses and we shared a quick good morning.

At the café the barista smiled at me. She had a cool galaxy tattoo and we chatted about the weather while she made my drink.

Walking home with coffee in hand I realized I was never really mad about the coffee. I was mad that my plan had changed. I hold on so tightly to my routine that even small changes feel like disasters.

But that change gave me more than I expected. Fresh air. A sunrise. A kind word from a neighbor. A nice moment with a stranger. My broken routine turned into something better than my usual quiet morning.

It made me think. Sometimes the best parts of life show up when our plans fall apart. Maybe the universe is not trying to ruin our day. Maybe it is just asking us to look up.",20,1755958529.0,emotionalintelligence,15,0.92,False

I treat brushing my teeth like taking a shower, all though be it more regularly. Not a 2 minute adventure, but a 20-30 minute project.

I start by washing my mouth out with mouthwash. I then start brushing for about 5-10 minutes making sure I brush every side of each tooth as thoroughly as possible (crooked teeth). I do not immediately rinse after brushing. Instead I start work on flossing with floss picks. I've tried regular floss but I just don't seem to have the dexterity to hold the string and place it between my teeth. When I floss with the picks, I saw down till I'm in between the teeth. I use various motions to pick at both my gums and my teeth. Sometimes I draw a little blood, sometimes I draw a lot of blood. I spend about ten minutes on this before ending with a water pick. After all of that I rinse once more with mouth wash. I do all of this first thing on the morning, and then as soon as I get home from work, and then against before I go to bed. When I'm on the field, I don't have the luxary of brushing around lunch, so instead I spend a 15 minute break rinsing my mouth out with a bottle of water.

The flossing is the hardest part for me. I've tried regular floss but I just don't have the dexterity for it. Everytime I go on for cleanings, I almost always still have gingivitis or an inflammation around two of my crowns. I get prescribed a bottle of chlorhexidine gluconate, I implement it into my routine, I go back 4 months later for a routine cleaning, rinse and repeat.

Other notes:
I'm using Colgate toothpaste. I've been told that only real difference between toothpaste is flouride, so when the dentist sent me home two years ago, I just started using the brand they put in my goodie bag.

The mouthwash is crest. Once again, just used the brand the dentist sent me home with.

Whenever I eat something, I try to always use water to rinse my mouth out afterwards. Not perfect about but I do it pretty routinely.

 I've forgone all caffeinated drinks and only drink water, coffee, and tea. I'm on a carnivore diet rooted heavily around fish, lamb, and veggies. Because I have weight issues (chronically underweight), I have forgone 90% of junk food.",2,1755958524.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

I need Dandelion to bully me. I want Dandelion to hack into every single computer on the Elmo and replace the wallpaper with her smug face. I want Dandelion to push me into a corner with her relentless teasing, both figuratively and literally. I want HK416 to be jealous of my relationship with Dandelion. I want Groza to develop an even greater inferiority complex because of Dandelion. I need her twisted sense of humor to cheer me up. I want Dandelion to step on me! I love Dandelion.

A lot of dolls want to be my adjutant. “Oh, let me sort your paperwork, SKK.” Stop doing this! It’s annoying! “Give me a second, I’ll bring you some coffee.” I don’t need that much coffee. They all pale in comparison to the greatness that is Dandelion. Dandelion knows that I’m a midwit. She’s literally the only one who can not only call me out on my bad ideas but actually turn those bad ideas into good ones.

Everyone says, “SKK has great affinity with dolls” or “Dolls absolutely adore SKK.” Well, I don’t need that! I need Dandelion! How do I level up and get affinity with Dandelion?

The likes of Springfield or Colphne genuinely think they can give me psychological aid. Guess what? I’m doing just fine! That’s why I need Dandelion to intentionally traumatize me further. That brat actually knows what she’s doing and will somehow make it beneficial for everyone.

Let me ask you a difficult question. How am I supposed to stay motivated doing my Gunsmoke runs if not by Dandelion constantly teasing me?

If Dandelion joins the Elmo, I will immediately buy her not just one, but four rings. Two for her hands, two for her feet. Don’t ask me why.

Groza ASMR is for weak low testosterone men. I need a 2 hour recording of Dandelion making fun of me.

When one sees Dandelion, the natural response is to fold immediately. Simping for Dandelion is based. 

Dandelion supremacy is the only way to move forward.

My home is fully set up if you’d like to work from here—there’s a desk, monitor, internet, coffee, and snacks. Basically, you can do your own work while he snoozes nearby.

For safety, I’ll be asking for a reference or a recent background check.
