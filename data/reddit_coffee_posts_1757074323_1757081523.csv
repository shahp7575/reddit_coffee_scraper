1n96bji,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1n96bji/need_help_pls/,need help pls,"Any advice or something??? I was bisexual as a teenager. Then I was exclusively gay FOR YEARS. However, I’m noticing I’ve always appreciated women and was very flirtatious especially after a few drinks as I grew older. Still would only have sex with men though… and trans… and non binary… 🤣 

Skip to 2025. I am screaming, crying, and throwing up (I'm not really just being dramatic) because I just started my master's program. On the second day, I see this beautiful woman, and I can’t freaking get her out of my head. I'm crushing hard. I’ve never crushed on a woman this hard. EVER! I’m daydreaming about us being together. I look forward to seeing her and talking to her. 

Here’s where I goofed. She mentioned hanging out and stuff and I completely dropped the ball and didn’t even get her number. I just recently got it. Strike 1. We were sharing stories and I slipped up in my story saying that I’m gay when really I’m realizing more bisexual possibly more open than that. Strike 2. 

Please this is new to me! Well maybe not new but it’s been a damn long time!! I don’t want strike 3 and I would like to get to know her more. I did finally get another as stated above. I asked her if she wanted to check out a coffee shop or this bar near me and she said she would love to. I’m with my godchildren right now and told her we can plan when not surrounded by three crazy kids. Love them.

If it’s reciprocated then yay but if not I’m not one of those weirdos who wait around waiting for my moment to move in that’s very predatory to me. If we end being just friends then that’s all we’ll be. ",1,1757081417.0,bisexual,0,1.0,False

Im looking to find a coffee shop within Cap hill with the following parameters in order of importance:

1. **Strong ass coffee** \--> specifically a strong iced coffee (*not cold brew or ice latte*). I haven't seen any places so far where you can order a plain iced coffee. Most cold brews ive tasted have such a dry taste and honestly never as good, and an ice latte is literally and expensive cup of milk. Im looking for *a true iced coffee, not watered down*. I want to be *running to the bathroom after three sips*.

2. **Fair Price** \--> I am a simple gal, I don't need any sweeteners or flavors, or milk substitutes. Preferably at a price of <$5. 

3. **Good selection of pastries** \--> Not a need but a want for those days that you want a sweet treat pick me up during your work day. I am pretty particular with my pastries, not too sweet and not too expensive. Love scones, croissants, a GOOD morning glory muffin, etc.

4. **Fair Price pt 2** \--> Maybe its that I am still getting used to Seattle prices, but I think its fair to expect that I can get a good simple coffee and a pastry for <$10 (if it can be done in NYC it can be done here).

5. **Distance** \--> preferably within a 10 min walk from pike/pine 10-12th ave area

6. **Friendly/Conversational Staff** \--> Hoping to find the place where I become a regular during the week, always nice to have a friendly face and convo on the side with my coffee

1n96a0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1n96a0a/why_is_the_american_home_k2r_spot_remover_still_a/,Why Is the American Home K2R Spot Remover Still a Top Pick?,"Testing out the American Home K2R 33001 was surprisingly enjoyable, given its role as a carpet spot remover and cleaning spray. I regularly deal with coffee spills, muddy footprints, and the occasional ""whoops"" moments from my dog, so a reliable spot remover is practically a must-have in my household. This product definitely stands out for its versatility. At first glance, it seemed like a pretty standard cleaner, but after testing, I was impressed by its practicality, though there are areas where it has room for improvement.

**Ease of Use and Design**  

The spray can design of this product is everything you'd hope for in a cleaning tool—simple and efficient, like the brand knew exactly what I wanted. No unnecessary parts, no complicated mechanisms—just point, spray, and wipe. The size is compact at 10 ounces, making it easy to handle. I used it several times in one week and didn't face any awkwardness while applying it, even on vertical surfaces like wallpaper. Yet, I couldn’t help but wonder if a slightly larger size option might be better for families or bulk cleaners. The lightweight frame is definitely appreciated when you have multiple spots to treat, but it would be nice not to need frequent replacements.

**Performance on Tough Stains**  

The cleaning power of this product really shines. It handled everything from a red wine spill on the carpet to greasy fingerprints on upholstery. I tested it on different materials, including a velvet chair, some dry-cleanable clothing, and a section of my rug, and the results were consistent each time. That quick-drying feature advertised on the can? It’s no joke. Within moments, surfaces looked (and smelled) completely fresh. What pleasantly surprised me was how there wasn’t any sticky residue afterward; it truly left “no mess behind,” a claim that I found entirely accurate. 

[Check American Home K2R 33001 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b000bqwn08/)  

**Strengths**  

Considering its many upsides, this product has quickly become my go-to for tackling stains. Here are some highlights I noticed during my testing:  
- Effective on multiple surfaces such as carpets, clothing, and upholstery.  
- Quick-drying formula means no waiting around for hours after cleaning.  
- Leaves no sticky mess or streaks behind, even on delicate fabrics like silk.  

**Negative Attributes**  

Although this spot remover performs exceptionally well in many areas, it isn't without its small flaws. Here are a few critiques based on my experience:  
- Not ideal for very large stains since the 10-ounce size runs out quickly with heavy use.  
- The strong (but temporary) chemical smell may bother those with sensitive noses.  
- Instructions could be clearer about compatibility with certain materials like leather.  

**Competing Options**  

Compared to other spot cleaners, like Resolve Carpet Spot & Stain Remover or OxiClean’s Carpet and Upholstery Cleaner, the American Home K2R holds its ground rather well. Its standout feature is the simplicity and speed with which it works. Some competitors require scrubbing to activate the formula, but here, it’s spray and move on. Where the rivals shine, though, is in offering more eco-friendly formulas. If going green is a priority, this cleaner may not be the best fit. However, for quick cleanups when you’re pressed for time, it beats out the competition in convenience every time.

**True Value**  

In terms of cost-effectiveness, the product is priced reasonably given its results. While there are cheaper alternatives on the market, they don’t always match the performance seen here. For me, the efficiency and mess-free finish justify the price. It’s particularly great for small households or occasional spills. Bigger families or those working in high-traffic areas might find themselves going through cans too quickly. Nevertheless, a product that keeps its promises without headaches feels worth every penny.

Got married two years ago and bought a house in the burbs. Working on starting a family. 1-2 kids. 

I generally like the suburbs, but I can tell my wife is lukewarm warm on it. We were just in Chicago last week and she kept bringing up all the things she missed- being able to walk to coffee shops, events, vibrant neighborhoods, restaurants etc. I miss those things too. But I always thought raising kids in the city was challenging. Shared walls, dirty air, noisy, questionable schools, and of course the cost. 

The suburbs as DINKS is not exciting, but I can see the benefits of when we have kids. 

Being HENRY’s we could swing 1.5-2MM home price, so we wouldn’t be jammed in a small apartment (at least in most cities!). We also have the luxury of picking a city- proximity to an airport is really the only consideration. 

Just wondering if other HENRY’s faced the same dilemma and how they made their decision.

\- no alcohol  
\- hardly any coffee, at most half of a very weak cup once or twice a week  
\- no gluten  
\- no refined sugar  
\- no dairy  
\- no processed grains like wheat etc

The things I do consume

\- romaine lettuce  
\- celery  
\- carrots  
\- almonds (limited amounts)  
\- cashews (limited amounts)  
\- apples (limited amounts)  
\- salmon  
\- chicken  
\- avocado  
\- eggs (limited amounts \~ 4 a week)  
\- pine seeds  
\- basil  
\- parsley  
\- spring onion  
\- garlic  
\- turmeric  
\- coconut oil  
\- coconut milk  
\- green kale  
\- fish oil  
\- linseeds  
\- psyllium husk  
\- hemp seeds

Maybe there's some foods I have forgotten to list there. But yeah I'm being super strict. I am also regularly exercising or going to the sauna, more or less every day, and trying my best to get in 8 hours of sleep, and reduce stress from work.

If I keep this up, ... which I have been doing now for almost two weeks. How long does it typically take to see very significant remission?

Aside from the original question here of ""duration"", I would also very much appreciate any and all other tips and tricks, as long as they are not based on over the counter medications or topical treatments.

I'm consider probiotics, and am paying close attention to visual and olfactory indicators of my own oral hygiene. I'm basically convinced that psoriasis is a systemic disease that is to a very great extent linked to gut health.

Thanks in advance for any helpful pointers, and in particular lived experiences on similar diets.",1,1757081092.0,Psoriasis,2,1.0,False

Discover Top Picks,"**Picture this: the rich aroma of freshly brewed espresso filling your kitchen, and the first sip of that perfect, velvety shot waking up your senses. If you’re a coffee lover, you know the magic of a good espresso.**

But with so many espresso makers on the market, finding the one that suits your needs can feel overwhelming. You might wonder, “What kind of espresso maker is best for me? ” This decision is crucial—not just for your morning routine but for crafting those moments of pure coffee bliss.

In this guide, we’ll navigate the maze of espresso machines together, helping you discover the ideal choice that fits your lifestyle and taste preferences. Get ready to elevate your coffee experience to new heights—let’s dive in!

# Types Of Espresso Makers

Choosing the [best espresso maker](https://gomehedi.com/best-espresso-makers/) depends on your needs. Manual machines offer control, while automatic ones provide convenience. Capsule machines are quick and easy for beginners. Each type caters to different preferences and skills. Consider your budget and desired coffee experience when selecting the ideal espresso maker.

When choosing an espresso maker, understanding the different types available can help you find the perfect match for your coffee-making adventures. Each type of machine offers unique features and benefits, making it crucial to consider your preferences and lifestyle. Whether you enjoy the hands-on approach or prefer the convenience of automation, there’s an espresso maker out there for you. Let’s dive into the diverse world of espresso machines.

# Manual Espresso Machines

Manual espresso machines are for those who enjoy the art of coffee-making. They require you to control every aspect of the process, from grinding beans to pressing the espresso shot. This hands-on approach can be rewarding, offering a sense of accomplishment when you pull the perfect shot. These machines are often favored by purists who appreciate the traditional espresso experience. They allow you to experiment with grind size, pressure, and water temperature. If you love being involved in crafting your espresso and have the time to fine-tune your skills, a manual machine might be your ideal choice.

# Semi-automatic Machines

Semi-automatic machines strike a balance between control and convenience. They automate some parts of the process, like water temperature and pressure, while allowing you to manually start and stop the extraction. This gives you the flexibility to adjust the shot length and strength according to your taste. These machines are popular among home baristas who want more control than an automatic machine offers but aren’t ready to commit to a fully manual one. If you enjoy experimenting with your espresso but still want a bit of automation, a semi-automatic machine could be the right fit for you.

1n962hf,https://i.redd.it/pg7f6mhfrcnf1.jpeg,Review #6: Cadenheads Staoisha 11y - June 25 Release,"**Background:**

*This bottle is the first Cadenheads release that I've managed to get my hands on. It feels a long time coming as someone who has lived in Edinburgh their whole life. However, I was only really aware of what they've been up to for the last year or so and, since then, I've been keeping an eye on all of their releases. I did pop into the shop earlier this year to find something but they offered me a pretty rare-to-find OB instead which I couldn't say no to. ( A review of that will be posted in due course).

From a glance at the June 2025 release, this bottle caught my eye immediately. [I'm a massive Bunnahabhain fan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1ky8622/review_3_bunnahabhain_15_douglas_laing_old/), yet I had never tried a Staoisha IB - or any whisky matured in Amontillado. On top of that, the tasting notes from Cadenheads and a [review of the June Outrun here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1l9uo8o/cadenheads_authentic_release_june_2025/) sounded incredible and totally unique. So I got in touch and reserved myself a bottle. Having been back since, I was told that they sold out very quickly so lucky I emailed ahead of time.

This is one of 186 bottles distilled in 2013 and released in June 2025.*

 
**ABV:** 55%

**Colour:** Copper

**Cask Breakdown:** Bourbon (6y) & Amontillado (5y)

**Price Paid:** £75

**Chill Filtered:** No

**Colour Added:** No

 
**Nose:**

Initially perfumed and delicate. Lavender leads into sweet parma violets and a touch of singed orange peel. A sticky, candied sweetness emerges - think cola cubes from your childhood corner shop mixed with a can of freshly opened Dr Pepper. The sweetness then slides into smoke, culminating in a dirty, cherry barbeque sauce note.

Alongside the above lies a funk, somewhere between blue cheese and savoury umami. A curious mishmash of a nose that shouldn’t work, yet somehow does.


**Palate:**

Incredibly oily and mouth coating. The alcohol is nicely integrated - despite the ABV, I don't think it needs a drop of water.

It's like a funfair crossed with a beach barbeque. The funfair gives us sweet elements: assorted pick & mix sweets, bubblegum, and even Lucozade energy. From the beach barbeque, we get savoury elements - charred and smoked meats, honey glazed ham and - as the review linked above, and Cadenheads themselves spotted - teriyaki salmon. It's like sweet and savoury are arm wresting to dominate this dram, and I'm really enjoying being the spectator. I'll adjudicate that savoury edges the contest. 


**Finish:**

A long, dark finish of sticky and sweet BBQ sauce, burnt coffee grounds, bitter cacao rich chocolate and soy sauce.

Contrasting the previous, I find a tang lingering on the edges of my tongue - sour lemon working against the char and bitterness.


**Verdict:**

So this is totally unlike any other whisky I've tried before. There’s so much happening in the glass, and it absolutely demands your attention. It’s challenging, not an easy sipper—and that’s exactly what I love about it.

As I've never tried any other Amontillado matured whiskies, I feel like I have to now. Are some of these notes typical of the style or is this as unique a profile as it feels to me today?

Even with my Bunnahabhain bias, this whisky thoroughly deserves its score..

**8/10. Something Special**

*Average Review Score: 6.0*


*10/10. Whisky Nirvana*

*9/10. Exceptional*

*8/10. Something Special*

*7/10. Very Good Indeed*

*6/10. Good Stuff*

*5/10. Average. In a Good Way*

*4/10. Some Promise*

*3/10. Disappointing*

*2/10. Avoid*

*1/10. Should Not Exist*

4/15 led to a second date. 2/15 led to a third date. 1 we were intimate, but we both decided to be friends afterward (we still hang out sometimes).

I felt a spark with 3-4 out of 15. But only 1 felt a spark with me. The rest told me I was nice, they felt friend vibes, but not a romantic connection.

I know the majority of first dates don't work out by nature, but I do feel like 1/15 being attracted to me is really low number and I'm wondering if there's something I can do differently.

I'm on the spectrum and can be a bit reserved. But I do ask questions, listen and can carry a conversation. I'm polite, I'm warm, I smile.

But I feel my demeanor is really platonic on dates. I'm mild-mannered. I don't really flirt or banter, like a lot of other people do on dates. I feel comfortable doing that once I get to know someone, but it doesn't feel natural to me to do that on a first date. I also wish I had a bit more humor.

Maybe the location of the first date is a factor too.  Having a drink in a downtown area with the lights and waterfront at night may make me feel more at ease to make a move than having an ice cream or coffee at a suburban plaza.",1,1757080780.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Farma Kanji stirred on the sofa, the electronic chime striking him with an odd sense of nostalgia.

In his sudden movement, the device slipped from his stomach and tumbled to the floor.

“Mm… too bright…”

His mind was clear, and the first thing his eyes landed on was a modern ceiling, crisp and immaculate. He could even make out the patterns etched into it.

Raising his left arm to shield himself from the light, he noticed the muscles along it, the watch snugly fitted on his wrist. A mild hunger gnawed at him, prompting an instinctive scan of his surroundings.

“So… that’s how it is. Just as predicted. I wonder if everyone’s okay.”

He commanded the assistant AI to read the time and the news.

*“It is May 28, 2048, 8:45 PM.”*

That meant he had finally broken free from the loop of Earth time—he was moving forward, beyond the barrier that had once trapped him. After countless trials, he had reached a point where survival in this timeline was permitted.

Startled, he glanced at his wrist. There was a casually scribbled note—its letters perfectly readable, not reversed.

“Huh?”

Farma exhaled deeply and swapped the watch to his right hand.

“So, left-handed to right-handed… then back to left-handed. The previous body must have been right-handed.”

How many times had the world flipped? The sensations were subtly wrong, persistently foreign. Standing carefully, he washed his face and patted it dry with a paper towel.

The reflection staring back at him was unfamiliar—skin clear and vibrant, sharp features, and no glasses or contacts.

“Not bad… my eyesight.”

Occupying Farma’s youthful body, he felt fortunate to be able to live fully by sight.

Drawing the shades, he looked outside.

Aircars zipped across the sky. Layers of light refracted through the Kanto Plain’s atmosphere, blending into a gentle gradient. Life sounds floated up: distant chatter, street noise, birdsong.

How long had he stood there, absorbing this flood of information with nothing but his senses? He had never so thoroughly digested the nuances of Earth’s civilization. Thirst finally reminded him to move.

He rifled through the usual shelf for instant coffee but found something luxurious—beans he’d never seen before.

*(Impressive. The aristocracy spares no expense.)*

With a flannel cloth on hand, he brewed it via the traditional drip method. The aroma unfolded luxuriously as hot water touched the grounds.

Savoring the coffee, he withdrew a simple black pen from his lab coat pocket. On a whim, he pointed it forward.

“Water Spear…”

Nothing happened. He confirmed that no divine power remained within him and set the pen on the desk. He experienced the awkward post-spell embarrassment last felt in elementary school.

“Just kidding!”

Alone, he let out the words with a sense of release. A photo frame near the monitor held Chiyu’s wedding picture. Her new spouse smiled beside her, along with their parents. Zenji and Ryoko, once lost in a traffic accident, were alive in this world.

As Farma realized he had accessed “the continuation of the other world’s timeline,” as Farma de Medicis had described, a small relief settled over him.

“Well… what’s going on outside?”

Opening the professor’s office door, he found the corridor alive with students and staff bustling to and fro.

He switched gears, recalling memories tied to this place—the experimental building’s layout, the faces of faculty and staff, the students he supervised, their research themes, and six months’ worth of emails. Pulling out his device, he began coordinating contacts and updates.

Engrossed in his work, he noticed the device vibrating in the corner of his eye. A selfie video and a message from his sister Chiyu appeared.

*“Onii-chan, want to have dinner tonight? Mom and Dad will be there too!”*

“Perfect. Family time. There’s so much to talk about, so much I want to know.”

Tonight, he would express gratitude to his parents, celebrate his sister’s marriage, and enjoy a relaxed meal. It had taken decades to reach this moment, though it still felt like the ordinary day that had ended just yesterday.

*“Ah, by the way, remember the password?”*

Chiyu added suddenly, as if remembering.

*“Escape game—finally done?”*

Was this some secret code? Tilting his head, Farma sent a vague reply: “Hmm, maybe.” Was it really Chiyu messaging him, or had a new abyss opened? Regardless, after decades, reunion would happen today.

A young woman appeared at the open door of Room 301, the professor’s office.

“Good morning, Professor Yakutani.”

Her voice startled him briefly. She approached the desk with ease, placing her bag down like she belonged.

“Good morning.”

*(Where do I know her from…?)*

He couldn’t tell if this was a first meeting or a familiar face. Memories across worlds intertwined; different personas shared one recollection. Determining which world his consciousness belonged to was difficult.

Noticing Farma’s gaze, the woman checked her attire and the name plate dangling from her neck strap—Amano. He had read her emails moments ago, but the name surprised him.

“Professor Yakutani? Something wrong?”

“N-no.”

“You seemed distracted, like a completely different person than yesterday. Are you all right?”

“Nothing at all! I’m fine! I’m taking the rest of the day off.”

“Today? But I thought today’s schedule was packed… wait. It’s empty?”

Amano’s astonishment as she checked the calendar was clear.

“All those tightly packed appointments—are they gone? A sync error?”

“No, I canceled everything. I’ll be on leave all week.”

Her surprise was evident; apparently, taking unscheduled leave was rare.

“No particular reason. I just thought… I’d skip work for a bit.”

The words slipped out childlike and sincere. In this world, the office would function even if he vanished for a week. He could afford a brief release from the relentless work he had been performing almost as penance. During this leave, he needed a complete mental reset—new staff, new relationships… he must inherit the environment *he* had maintained.

“Professor taking leave… did something happen?”

“Nothing at all.”

“I see?”

Amano blinked.

“If you have no pressing appointments today, feel free to take a half-day as well.”

“Understood! I’ll take care of the arrangements!”

Her smile, wide and genuine, suggested she was delighted.

“Also, Professor, I’ve sent the seventh-year expense report you requested.”

“Seventh-year?”

“Yes. Eikou, the seventh year.”

Her cheerful, polite tone made Farma cover his mouth, stunned.

\*(Did she just say Eikou… a regnal year, not a name?)

This era was unknown to him—neither Reiwa nor Manpo. What branch of history had split here? Did this world lack SOMA?

“And the SOMA budget?” he asked.

“SOMA? Sorry, is that a new project in Soma City?”

She genuinely had no clue.

“Ah… forget I asked.”

“Understood…! Professor Yakutani, make sure to fully refresh yourself!”

Farma forced down his now lukewarm coffee, muttering softly.

*(Another unknown world.)*

SOMA did not exist here, and as Farma de Medicis had suggested, this world might not fade gently—or perhaps it would, depending on some trigger. Farma had yet to learn the fixed future and fate of this timeline. Still, he could act without repeating past mistakes. His course of action remained unchanged.

“…Amano, may I ask a quick question? Just five minutes.”

“Of course! Anything at all!”

He would begin by learning. Noticing an unfamiliar note written in Saint-Flouve Empire script reading “handover,” he lowered his gaze and nodded to himself.

By dividing his consciousness, he could sleep and return to the other world, living today here and tomorrow there. Henceforth, he would live both lives simultaneously, never letting go of either.

Existence was, above all, freedom.

**April 12, 1158**

A remote village on the outskirts of the Saint-Flouve Republic fell prey to a mysterious contagion.

The first victim was the elderly physician who ran the village’s sole clinic. With his death, the settlement of 531 souls became a doctorless village overnight.

Initial attempts at containment failed, and the disease spread like wildfire—from person to person, from corpse to living body—engulfing the entire community in an unstoppable wave.

Day by day, neighbor after neighbor vanished. With no means of summoning aid from distant villages, food stores dwindled, and the villagers suffered under the twin burdens of illness and starvation.

A trembling child sat before her home, exhausted. Hollow eyes, arms thin as withered branches, folded around her knees. She watched helplessly as her mother, collapsed at the doorstep, gradually succumbed to decay.

Above, a crow perched silently in the trees, watching the girl with patient, unblinking eyes. It observed the village as it succumbed to ruin.

Water or lying down—she couldn’t decide.

As the girl deliberated, she became aware of footsteps approaching from the front. A shadow fell across her upturned face, and she lifted her gaze to meet the newcomer.

“Hello.”

A young man with golden hair tipped his hat in greeting.

The vitality emanating from him was overwhelming. From the overflowing life of the outside world, he seemed like a single beam of light cutting into the swirling death of the village.

“Where is Doctor Etan’s clinic?” she asked.

“Doctor Etan was the first to die.”

The only physician protecting the villagers had perished. Instantly, as if a dam had burst, a flood of death surged through the village from beyond its borders.

“I hurried here, but I suppose I was too late. Are there any adults left?”

The girl muttered curses under her dry lips.

“…Everyone’s gone. Just like that. There’s no one left able to move… Maybe a few still survive, but none step outside. The food’s rotted away…”

She stared at him, her gaze vacant yet searching.

“Did you come to take me away?”

The young man shook his head.

“No. I haven’t come for anyone. I’ve brought the medicine Doctor Etan requested.”

From beneath his coat, he revealed a nameplate. Its lettering was long, dignified—almost noble, the girl thought.

“I am a pharmacist sent ahead from the capital of the Saint-Flouve Republic.”

“A… pharmacist? Not a… healer?”

The girl faltered at the unfamiliar term. He explained patiently: in a system once dependent on divine arts, practitioners who embraced a scientific approach to medicine had adopted a new title—pharmacist—anchored in empirical knowledge rather than miracles.

“Yes. And it is our mission, from a humanitarian perspective, to deliver the medicines and medical care necessary to every corner of this world, now that guardian spirits have finished their role and miracles have vanished.”

True to his words, the medicines he brought saved countless lives. Adults and children who had been on the brink of death clung to life. Soon, the village was bathed in the light of medicine, and aid spread to every corner.

When the main relief contingent arrived, the villagers welcomed them openly. Until the plague was driven from the village, the young pharmacist worked tirelessly, encouraging the villagers and forging relationships based on mutual respect.

The medicine bags he distributed bore no emblem the girl recognized from familiar pharmacies. Instead, in a language understood across the world, a simple, powerful illustration adorned each bag:

**“PHARMACIES MUNDI”**

Hands linked together, reaching outward—an image of hope and unity stretched boldly across the label, a promise that even in the darkest times, life and care would endure.

I am deeply grateful to everyone who supported the creation of this work and to all those who contributed along the way.

Several readers have asked whether Kanji Yakutani and Farma returned to their original worlds. The answer is: no.

As mentioned in the final chapter, their ultimate fate is left ambiguous. For a definitive account, please refer to the epilogue, which clarifies the events that follow.

Recently, she has learned to use the potty well enough to even wake up in the night and use the potty instead of peeing in her pull up. Great! Except now she has been waking up so much earlier and staying awake, wanting to play etc. For a long time my routine was to wake up around 6, have some alone time with my coffee, and then confront the day.

This new early waking up thing is extremely cramping my style and I know it sounds dramatic and princessy but not getting to have even like 5 minutes where no one needs anything from me during the day is like....ruining my mood completely.

Meanwhile, in general I've never had worse sleep in my life so waking up earlier feels impossible. We've tried pushing bedtime later, tried an earlier bedtime, OK to Wake Clock, nothing is keeping her asleep or in her room until 7 anymore. I am so short tempered and hate myself in the mornings now.

Do I need to just start going to bed at 8 and waking up at 4 or 5? I can't be the only one in this boat.

What will you do if you witnessed someone glitch out of reality and you just start forgetting him, and when you ask about him everyone claims they don't remember such a person? This is Episode 2: No One Named ""Kenji Morita"" of my original anime project. 

[ Scene 1: At home ] ‒ Time: 11 : 40 pm

Akari sitting on the couch reading ""Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World"" a book by Haruki Murakami, on a shelf beside him a cup of coffee. 

Akari: ""is what that driver said actually real? I cant find a logical explanation though...""

takes a sip of the coffee.

Akari: ""In that incident there wasn't much blood on the ground. Maybe the victim is still alive."" 

11 : 50 pm

Akari closes the book and opens the T.V.

Akari checking the watch: ""I guess its almost time. 10 minutes.""

T.V. News: ""The driver ,Kenji Morita, who was involved into yesterday's incident was interrogated by the police. Kenji Morita claims that he doesn't remember driving at this late and he gets a headache whenever trying to remember the incident...""

Akari closes the T.V.

Akari serious look: ""wait what?"" 

Akari stands up, wears his coat and rushes leaving the house. The T.V. opens again.

[ Scene 2: The police station ] ‒ Time: 11: 55

2 cops talking in the hallway, outside the interrogation room.

Cop1 scratching his head in confusion: ""man, this driver just needs a therapist at this point""

Cop2: ""yeah, he was probably drunk or something!""

Cop1 laughing: ""yeah I agree!""

Cop2: ""or maybe he was just lying!""

a cop leaving the interrogation room with a serious face.

Cop3: ""If he was lying or needed a therapist then Akari wouldn't have taken this case seriously. There is something wrong going on.""

Cop2: ""do you actually believe that guy? Like how can someone glitch out of reality thats so illogical!""

Cop1: ""Yeah. Also just so you know detective Akari believes that there is always a logical explanation so he is probably searching for clues now.""

Akari asks: ""Where is the interrogation room?""

Cop2: ""speak of the devil..""

Cop1: ""Why are you here?""

Akari: ""I am here because I am a detective and my job is to investigate. Now can you tell me where is the interrogation room?""

Cop3 pointing at the room behind him: ""here. We asked him, he just cant remember anything about the incident.""

Akari enters the room. 

Akari: ""Kenji-san, don't you remember telling me that you saw the guy glitch?!""

Kenji: ""I..I don't remember..I barely recognize you..""

Akari talking to the cop beside him: ""did anything happen made him lose his memory?""

Cop4: ""No. There is nothing wrong with his brain. We sent him to a doctor, he said its all fine.""

Akari checks the watch, its 11:59 pm. 

Akari: ""its almost midnight..""

Kenji: ""sorry, but I dont remember anything related to this incident. I remember what happened before it though."" 

Akari: ""what happened? What can you remember exactly?""

Kenji: ""I remember heading ho‒"" 

Kenji starts glitching out then suddenly he disappears. Akari and Cop4 was shocked for a moment, then there shocked expressions slowly fades.

Akari: ""wh.what? I.I remember there was someone sitting in front of me just now on that chair..""

Cop4: ""Yes. I think..was there?..Someone..?""

Akari: ""Yes. There was! A guy sat infront of us here! He was going to say something! Then he suddenly disappeared! Don't you remember?""

Cop4: ""Who are you talking about? Sir, there was no one here.""

Akari: ""th.there was..what did just happen?""

Cop4: ""Sir, can you leave the room? You shouldn't be here.""

Akari leaves the room and asks the 3 cops who where still standing and chatting outside the room.

Akari: ""Hey, wasnt there someone inside just now? I don't remember his name but there was someone inside this room, we where interrogating, right?""

Cop2: ""What are you talking about? There was only you and the other cop inside""

Akari heads back home

[ Scene 3: At home ] ‒ 12: 05 am

Akari enters home and finds the T.V. on, he closes it.

Akari: ""I remember closing this before leaving though..do I?""

Akari gets a notebook and writes down:

""there was someone in the interrogation room, he said ""I remember heading ho‒"" then just glitched out..I need to investigate this case."" 

Then lays down on bed, staring at the ceiling.

Akari: ""I guess..I cant find a logical explanation for this..but i would never give up.."" 

then he falls asleep.

***Same disclaimer: I’m not affiliated with any organizations or organizers. I pull what I see from ads, posts, and sites so you can decide for yourself.***

**A few friendly reminders**  
**➕ Mindset check:** If going alone feels intimidating, use this community to find others interested in the same event. Post in the comments to link up! And mingle with those at the event!

**🏳️‍🌈 This month’s challenge:** Each month, I come up with a challenge for myself in creating the lists. For August, it was events for early 20s and those over 50. For September, I dug deep to find more LGBTQ+ events, like Crush Dance Bar and Sapphic Sip & Spark. Of course, keeping 20s and 50s in the mix. Please note that these aren’t my events, and they may not always appear in my algorithm. I try my hardest each month to broaden the mix. If you’ve spotted events I missed, I’d love to hear about them, and I am sure others would as well (so put them in the comments). 

**🌱 DC’s going through it:** I added a few volunteer events. Not dating-specific, but being around people who care about the same things you do is always a green flag.

**🦅 Football is back:** I included Eagles games. They’re not the DC team, but I’m an Eagles fan, and they are the current Super Bowl champions. If you have a different team, please let us know where you watch so others can join.

**🙏 Thank you:** Huge thank you to everyone who DMs me updates and gives me shout-outs. It’s always fun to see which events people end up attending.

**📅 50+ events:** As always, organized by date, newest up top.

**🚫 Not comprehensive:** If I missed something, drop it in the comments and I’ll try to update. (No promises if it’s already mid-September, as I’ll be deep in October’s list or enjoying fall (my favorite season).)

**👥 Friend-making note:** A few on the list lean more toward meeting friends than dating (Timeleft dinners, Kin coffee, The Dinner Table, thehikecrew). Still great ways to build your circle.

**💭 Looking ahead:** I’d love your feedback. Should I keep doing these? And if so, where’s the best home for them? Reddit, or maybe moving them to Substack or Instagram? These lists were easy to compile in the summer (I hate the heat and prefer staying indoors). But as we head into fall, winter, and spring — my favorite seasons — I’m rethinking how October and beyond might look. Does this format work for you? What would make it better?

The strange part is: I’m sure I barely even understood it in a clear, intellectual way. And yet the emotions hit me so strongly that I was bawling my eyes out.

It made me wonder — what does it mean for a human being to not fully “understand” something, and still have such a visceral emotional reaction to it?

I think what happened is that my emotions understood before my intellect did. The rhythm, the repetition, the broken images — they carried feelings of loneliness, hesitation, wasted time, and longing, even when my mind was still catching up. Lines like “I have measured out my life with coffee spoons” or ""There will be time, there will be time / To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet"" or “I do not think that they will sing to me” bypassed rational analysis and went straight to the heart.

You don’t need to know exactly what every image “means” to recognize the ache of regret, the fear of time slipping away, or the sadness of not belonging.

**Dalal** : caramel , sandalwood , orange , an okayish gourmand attar .  
Al rehab has better option tho.   
4/10.     
.
**French coffee** : This is the reason i ordered , dark coffee with very sweet caramel . Smells like kopiko . Will definitely get the edp .       
9/10.    
.
**Golden sand** : vanilla , caramel but this time i also get soothing floral notes ,also this has woody notes balancing everything out . Way softer than the rest.
8/10.    
.
**Bakhoor** : Notes mention vanilla , which i don't get ,i get lots of floral n fruity notes which def aren't going well together, smells like citrus floraly soap you will get in a public washroom.  
3/10 .    
.
**Soft** : TONS OF CITRUS , unlike the name the lemon notes in this isn't soft at all, this smells sour , tbh i don't get anything else than citrus and a hint of caramel . Qas excited about this because the hype but this is just another soapy scent.    
4/10.    
.
**Zahrat hawaii** : unlike soft this is more balanced citrus, now are are talking , pineapple , fresh coconut , i also get strawberry with a good amount of sweetness . Smells like a fruity mocktail you will get in a beachside.   
7.5/10.     
.
**Lovely** : Again a citrusy fragrance 🌛, but !! this is the best one , this is the least synthetic citrus out of these . This smells fresh and clean (and just a lil bit soapy).    
8/10 .        
 
**Choco musk** : If you don't have any attars or even perfume. Get this , even if you don't like the notes get this for trying out specially since winter is here .Been using for 2 years and the compliments still surprise me . Few of the comparisons are :    
10/10 (for the price we are getting amazing fragrance).      
.
Now one thing i have noticed is all of these a very similar except french coffee and choco musk , half of them are soapy Citrusy scents and half sweet caramel gourmand.      
You don't need all since all of these are so similar.    
.
**In citrus** : lovely and zahrat hawaii (both are similar ).

Also french coffee is great.

.
**Blue wave** : i love blue frags but this smells like a fabric wash. Get this if you wanna smell like surf Excel.     
.
**Chocolate musk** : nothing like choco musk. smells like a cheap vanilla essence and chocolate syrup whose only resemblance to chocolate is brown colour.   
Drydown is that of milk chocolate.
But its still bearable.    
.
**White musk** : very nauseating sweet ,and  nothing like white musk .
.
**Litchi** : smells exactly like those heart shaped candies.      
.
**Strawberry melon**: like the name suggests, amalgamation of 2 fruits that doesn't work together.
Overly sweet .      
.
**Hajre aswad** : if you really wanna try al nuaim , try this . This actually has white musk and non nauseating floral notes.          
.
Only scenario in which you should wear al nuaim: You have successfully captured all your enemies inside one non ventilated room . Just break the bottle in that room and you are done .🌚.      

Stay tf away from al nuaim , also the package mentions that **its not safe to apply on skin** !!

1n95sk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1n95sk8/explore_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_hario_v60/,Explore the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Hario V60 Worth It,"The Hario V60-02W, a ceramic coffee dripper from Japan, has been my daily brewing companion for the past few weeks. As someone who takes coffee preparation seriously, I’ve always admired manual brewers for the level of control they offer. With this particular pour-over device, I’ve been able to enjoy not only the craft of making coffee but also its stunning simplicity. My mornings now feel like mini coffee rituals. That said, while it has many strong points, there are some aspects worth noting before diving into this product.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Hario ceramic coffee dripper screams quality craftsmanship. Its minimalist design pairs beautifully with the rest of my kitchen setup, and the white ceramic finish makes it feel more like an elegant piece of decor than just a kitchen tool. The durable Japanese ceramic retains heat impressively well, which keeps your brewing temperature consistent throughout the process. However, I did find the ceramic material to be slightly on the heavy side. While it’s not a dealbreaker, it’s noticeable when compared to lighter plastic drippers.  

[Don’t wait—check Hario V60-02W price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b000p4d5hg/)

**Pour-Over Performance**  
Brewing with the Hario V60 made me appreciate how much control it gives over the process. Its specialty cone shape and spiral ridges aren’t just for show; they help layer the coffee grounds evenly and extract rich flavors. I experimented with different grind sizes and water pouring speeds and was pleasantly surprised at how well this dripper brings out subtle floral and fruity notes in lightly roasted beans. That being said, it does demand more effort from the user compared to an automated coffee maker. For first-time pour-over enthusiasts, there’s a learning curve.

**Traditional Meets Modern Craftsmanship**  
One of the cool things about this dripper is that it’s crafted using Arita-yaki—a traditional Japanese ceramic technique with over 400 years of history. When I found out each Hario dripper is handmade by a local craftsperson, it added a deeper appreciation for the item. Although you’re paying for high-quality craftsmanship here, it’s worth noting the extra care needed while handling. Dropping it on a hard surface, even accidentally, feels like a nightmare scenario waiting to happen.  

**Favorable Aspects**  
Here are a few highlights of my experience:  
- Allows for excellent control over brewing, enabling a tailored coffee experience.  
- Attractive, minimalist design enhances the aesthetic of any kitchen.  
- Durable ceramic excels at heat retention, keeping the brewing temperature stable for optimal extraction.  
- Handmade with traditional Japanese techniques, adding an artisanal touch.  

**Negative Attributes**  
However, there are some downsides to keep in mind:  
- Ceramic construction makes it heavier and more delicate compared to plastic alternatives.  
- Not beginner-friendly; the technique can be tough to master for consistent results initially.  
- Requires paper filters, which some might find inconvenient to keep buying.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Other options in the pour-over market include plastic drippers like the Bee House Dripper and stainless steel designs like the Kalita Wave. While the Kalita Wave impresses with its flat-bottomed design for evenly balanced brewing, I found it less customizable than the Hario in terms of pour speed and grind size variations. Plastic drippers, on the other hand, are lightweight and near-indestructible, but they lack the heat retention and premium feel of ceramic builds. Ultimately, the Hario V60 strikes a perfect balance between visual appeal, brewing performance, and hands-on control.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
The price for this ceramic dripper is justifiable given its performance and handmade craftsmanship. If you’re someone who relishes the art of coffee brewing, this is an investment that offers an unparalleled experience. It’s not the most budget-friendly dripper out there, but the enduring quality and the ability to brew rich, nuanced coffee make it stand out. That said, if you’re only after quick daily caffeine fixes, an automated machine may serve you better.

1n95rts,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1n95rts/delve_into_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Delve Into the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Express Review,"The Keurig K-Express has become a trusted companion in my kitchen after several weeks of daily use. To be honest, I wasn’t sure if spending money on yet another coffee maker would be worth it, but this one promised simplicity with its single-serve setup and sleek design. While I’ve seen many devices claim to deliver convenience and performance, this model stood out because it boasted essential features without an overwhelming complication of options.

**Elegant Yet Compact Design**  
Squeezing it into my kitchen, which already feels too crowded for comfort, was a surprisingly easy task. At just 6.5 inches wide, it feels as though the Keurig K-Express was made with those pressed for counter space in mind. The modern black finish blends seamlessly with my other appliances, maintaining a cohesive kitchen vibe. My coworker commented that it reminded her of the higher-end café stations in sleek offices, and to some extent, it does have that look. More importantly, the removable 36 oz water tank located at the back ensures that re-filling doesn't become a frequent headache.

**Effortless Operation With Room For Variety**  
Morning fogginess doesn't mix well with complex appliances. Thankfully, operating this device feels intuitive, with the simple push-button controls guiding you to a fresh cup of coffee in just minutes. It’s ridiculously simple to use: just pop in your K-Cup pod, select your preferred cup size (6, 8, or 10 oz), and wait for that satisfying stream of coffee. I’ve tried a wide range of pods, from fruity Ethiopian blends to indulgent hot cocoa, and the flavors remain wonderfully consistent. Not having to wait for the device to reheat between consecutive cups is definitely an underrated feature I value during busy weekends hosting friends.

Check [Keurig K-Cup Coffee Maker K-Express](https://ultimodule.com/p/b0bn9srqt9/) **price on Amazon**.

**Upsides**  
• Fast brewing: perfect for mornings when I’m rushing to work.  
• Compact design fits easily into cramped kitchen corners.  
• Travel-friendly drip tray accommodates my taller 7-inch to-go mugs.  
• The maintenance alert reminds me when it’s time for cleaning after 250 brews.

**Areas of Concern**  
• Plastic build feels lightweight but slightly less durable.  
• Water reservoir placement could be more accessible for quicker refills.  
• The included cleaning instructions could have been clearer.  
• Lack of an option for stronger coffee on default brew settings.

**Features Designed With Thoughtfulness**  
The auto-off feature caught my attention because I'm someone who tends to leave appliances running unnecessarily. The device shuts itself off five minutes post-brew, conserving energy (and perhaps saving me a tiny chunk of the utility bill). On the flip side, as lightweight as it is (a mere 4.5 lbs.), it can feel a bit ‘plasticky,’ and some users might wish for a sturdier build. But then again, lightweight means it’s easy to move around if, like me, you reorganize spaces every few months.

**Strengths in Fast Morning Routines**  
The true strength of this coffee maker lies in how smooth it makes mornings. When my family visits, I often find myself brewing cup after cup without hiccups, thanks to the back-to-back brewing function. The 36 oz water tank handles about three average-sized mugs, meaning I only refill it every second or third day—an undeniable perk compared to smaller devices. It’s eco-conscious too, accommodating the My K-Cup Universal Reusable filter for anyone like me who occasionally prefers grinding their beans.

**Challengers**  
While tests show the Keurig K-Express offering consistent performance, I’ve compared it to rival models like the Nespresso Essenza Mini. Unlike Keurig, the Nespresso machines lean into espresso options, perfect for richer—but smaller—shots. On the other hand, devices from brands like Hamilton Beach often boast slightly larger water capacities. However, they lack Keurig’s simplicity and versatility with pods. The absence of back-to-back brewing often tilts the scales in this model's favor because reducing wait times during busy mornings matters.

**True Value**  
Given the features packed into the machine and its price tier, it feels like a solid investment for simple, fast, and diverse brews. It may not cater entirely to espresso purists, but for anyone stepping into the world of easy-to-use, everyday coffee makers, it strikes an excellent balance between functionality and affordability. Even my budget-conscious friend admitted that the variety of compatible pods justified the cost. To me, nothing says ""value"" more than frequently turning to a device in a routine without ever feeling the slightest annoyance over its design.

I had an espresso pot in the past and although it made great coffee, I never liked how chunky it was and how you could only use it for making coffee. Since I want to buy whole beans for the better taste, I also had three small electric grinders which grinded the beans well and also served for spices, but they all broke and I had to buy a new one. I also tried filter paper coffee but I don’t like how you need to buy the filter paper again and again.

Now I’m thinking of just getting a mortar to grind the beans, cook them in water and pour it over a little sieve straight into the cup.

Akari: ""In that incident there wasn't much blood on the ground. Maybe the victim is still alive."" 

11 : 50 pm

Akari closes the book and opens the T.V.

Akari checking the watch: ""I guess its almost time. 10 minutes.""

T.V. News: ""The driver ,Kenji Morita, who was involved into yesterday's incident was interrogated by the police. Kenji Morita claims that he doesn't remember driving at this late and he gets a headache whenever trying to remember the incident...""

Akari closes the T.V.

Akari serious look: ""wait what?""

2 cops talking in the hallway, outside the interrogation room.

Cop1 scratching his head in confusion: ""man, this driver just needs a therapist at this point""

Cop2: ""yeah, he was probably drunk or something!""

Cop1 laughing: ""yeah I agree!""

Cop2: ""or maybe he was just lying!""

a cop leaving the interrogation room with a serious face.

Cop3: ""If he was lying or needed a therapist then Akari wouldn't have taken this case seriously. There is something wrong going on.""

Cop2: ""do you actually believe that guy? Like how can someone glitch out of reality thats so illogical!""

Cop1: ""Yeah. Also just so you know detective Akari believes that there is always a logical explanation so he is probably searching for clues now.""

Akari asks: ""Where is the interrogation room?""

Cop2: ""speak of the devil..""

Cop1: ""Why are you here?""

Akari: ""I am here because I am a detective and my job is to investigate. Now can you tell me where is the interrogation room?""

Cop3 pointing at the room behind him: ""here. We asked him, he just cant remember anything about the incident.""

Akari enters the room. 

Akari: ""Kenji-san, don't you remember telling me that you saw the guy glitch?!""

Kenji: ""I..I don't remember..I barely recognize you..""

Akari talking to the cop beside him: ""did anything happen made him lose his memory?""

Cop4: ""No. There is nothing wrong with his brain. We sent him to a doctor, he said its all fine.""

Akari checks the watch, its 11:59 pm. 

Akari: ""its almost midnight..""

Kenji: ""sorry, but I dont remember anything related to this incident. I remember what happened before it though."" 

Akari: ""what happened? What can you remember exactly?""

Kenji: ""I remember heading ho‒"" 

Kenji starts glitching out then suddenly he disappears. Akari and Cop4 was shocked for a moment, then there shocked expressions slowly fades.

Akari: ""wh.what? I.I remember there was someone sitting in front of me just now on that chair..""

Cop4: ""Yes. I think..was there?..Someone..?""

Akari: ""Yes. There was! A guy sat infront of us here! He was going to say something! Then he suddenly disappeared! Don't you remember?""

Cop4: ""Who are you talking about? Sir, there was no one here.""

Akari: ""th.there was..what did just happen?""

Cop4: ""Sir, can you leave the room? You shouldn't be here.""

Akari leaves the room and asks the 3 cops who where still standing and chatting outside the room.

Akari: ""Hey, wasnt there someone inside just now? I don't remember his name but there was someone inside this room, we where interrogating, right?""

Cop2: ""What are you talking about? There was only you and the other cop inside""

Akari heads back home

\[ Scene 3: At home \] ‒ 12: 05 am

Akari enters home and finds the T.V. on, he closes it.

Akari: ""I remember closing this before leaving though..do I?""

Akari gets a notebook and writes down:

""there was someone in the interrogation room, he said ""I remember heading ho‒"" then just glitched out..I need to investigate this case."" 

Then lays down on bed, staring at the ceiling.

   I had a shift on Wednesday that I called out of because I woke up with a fever and my boss just told me to let her know a day before if something like that happened again and I said okay. 
    So I’ve been feeling like absolute caca for the last two days, the usual symptoms cough, runny nose, throat hurting, dizzy, and low fever. 
    So yesterday I ordered an at home Covid test and I took it and it came out positive. I texted my boss, and I told her that I had tested positive for Covid and I sent her the picture of the test to prove that I was not lying. And then she basically told me that I needed to post in the work group chat that I was sick and offer up my shifts. 
    I’m supposed to work in three hours and no one is taking my shift (like I thought would happen). I don’t know what to say to her and I don’t know what to do. I really like her as a boss, but I can’t come into work. I’m literally sick as hell and I have Covid. It’s so contagious especially around food and drinks. 
    And we even have regulars who come in every day and they are older. I do not want to risk giving them Covid because they could literally die if they have any kind of underlying health issues. 
    I understand me trying to give up my shifts a day before is really annoying, but I didn’t have the money to go get a test before yesterday and I told her as soon as I knew. Please let me know any advice. Thank you.",1,1757079997.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

I'm wearing my Wolverine boots. They look like they're about an inch and a half, maybe slightly over, but when I asked the VMF about heel rules they said, ""No, wear whatever you want."" One of the clerks says he even wears flip-flop some days. I'm not a fan of flip-flops so that's not a me issue, but I *do* like the idea that shoes are shoes. I like wearing boots. It's amazing that there's some arbitrary rule that might say if your heel like on Timberlands are 2 inches you're now in some sort of danger. 

Like with the rest of the dress code I assume everyone else has how they said VMF wears what they want. There's no uniform. You *can* get USPS stuff if you really want it like they will issue jackets in the winter if you want one, but you can wear your own, so why would anyone want the official one? For pants they said whatever, jeans, khakis, cargo pants, sweat pants, shirts are any shirt you want as long as there's nothing offensive written on it, and presumably nothin political because of the Hatch Act. 

This VMF in New Haven even have people vaping at work, which I assume is a no-no but they are a very laid back bunch. I asked about bringing coffee and they said, ""The other clerk has his own coffee machine and snack center on his  desk, bring what you want"". I know the advancement isn't great if you don't jump over to EAS, but it seems like a solid job with plenty of opportunity for overtime, a steady schedule, every Federal holiday actually off, and pretty stellar benefits.

1n95mjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1n95mjm/layout_help/,Layout Help,"Hi - we are knowing down a wall to renovate our kitchen and struggling with ideas on layout. The kitchen designer is slow to respond so it is difficult to bounce ideas back and worth. We want to keep all of the windows we currently have (which means we are adding a window back to the one drawing where noted). We do not like the fridge location - too far from the work areas. We do not want the sink, dishwasher, or stove in the island. The sink is in its current location in this photograph. If we move to under the double window that is approximately 8 feet (unsure how expensive that is). We do not like the dishwasher right next to the stove. We would like to include a pantry cabinet with pullout drawers (we have that now and it will be hard to give up). Any ideas? We considered not centering the stove, but not sure if that would look odd/imbalanced. 

Kitchen is 22 x 12. I included a photo of the 12 foot wall with the window added back in (and pantry on right of photo). I also included shots of the 22 foot wall (one as designed and one I marked up) as well as an overhead view (when the window on the 12 foot wall was removed), but it helps show the space. 

Appreciate any ideas.

1n95m34,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n95m34/fn_hr_volshen_herald_of_the_flesh/,"[FN] [HR] Volshen, Herald of The Flesh","Real quick! this is a story I written for a D&D character, its my first time really writing anything. This story has alot of elements of body horror and creepy eldritch vibes!

Yet again Volshen finds himself back on the hunt, finding himself slipping through the shadows, stalking his next target, a dragonborn sorcerer. After this experiment, hopefully he would be just one step closer to figuring out the soul, and why magic is so bound to it. While young he grew up in a small lizard folk community in the city, he always found himself sneaking through the walls of a local theater to watch the travelling mages, he found himself in awe of the magic they would cast, how the spells would flow from one to the other, how the runes would almost dance and glimmer in the air with each new spell being a performance. Magic just like craftsmanship was an art, and it had him in a grasp. Yet fate was cruel and he had no talent for mage craft, he would never be able to grasp the strings of magic like the mages he was in awe of, though never being able to cast a spell, volshen was dedicated to the arts. So never being able to wield magic, he studied the runes behind it, every rune was a small fragment of the language that had built magic. As time danced on, he never gave up on his fruitless studies, no rune held the answer to the language, you could easily give names to the runes based on what they did, like the runes of simple chromatic elements; fire, cold, poison, lightning etcetera. Yet the actual names of runes have always been lost to history, the average rune smith could easily read off a line of glyphs carved into an item, telling you how they link together, how the threads of magic intertwine into a loom of reality defying wonder. 

Years later, in his early twenties, while scouring the library of his local college he had found a tome tucked into the unsorted aisle of the library, the tome called “runes of magic and the mystery they bring” had belonged to an old professor with an obsession with runes, much like himself. The tome had held information far more advanced than the standard magecraft books lining the shelves of the library. The fact that all living things had magic inside of them was common knowledge, even if a person could not cast spells magic would still aid them in small ways, like an athlete; a runner specifically the more they would practice and train, magic would naturally flow into their muscles and just help you go just a little bit further then you would without it. Typically in cases like this the differences are so miniscule that with or without it, it would be hard to notice. Yet the tome proposed an interesting question, why does magic naturally flow into people? Normally to call upon any magic a mage would have to use a medium to do so, such as a chant, large hand sigils and motions, or via channeling it through a material with magical importance; bones, crystals, rare woods and herbs. So why does it without any command, without any provocation or evocation naturally aid people? The tome continued on explaining that the soul itself might hold the secret of perfecting magic, that the soul itself, the true driving force in a living creature might be made of magic and not some other unknown spiritual force, that the soul instead of being granted by the gods, was instead given to us from magic? Quickly volshen, who was no stranger to stealing, stuffed the tome into his backpack and exited the library, the tome had opened up more pathways and ideas for him, and one idea above the other held the attention of his brain, he would grasp his own soul.

Days go by as Volshen quickly gathers the resources for his new experiment, the tome had given him a new idea, he was going to grasp his own soul in his body. Figuring out how to do this would be a rough process yet a plan had quickly formed in his mind, An old technique coming from a wandering tribe of nomads named “rune carvers” the carvers were the first group of people in recorded history to perform magic, however they did it in an incredibly brutal and almost barbaric way, of taking a weapon and physically carving the rune into the air to call upon its power. This skill took insane amounts of strength to accomplish and was even rare among the tribe, however after more and more “carvers” had popped up, one of them figured out to cut the shape of the runes onto their own bodies, which over time would fade but would grant the wielder the ability to use that rune in small capacities. However, over time after having runes carved into your body your body would start to deteriorate due to how brutal raw magic on the body was, since there was no medium or anything to brunt the force of the magic. Making this an incredible self destructive technique, and is currently banned in most places, yet this would not be stopping volshen. His plan was to carve an advanced array of runes into his body, placing them along every limb, if his research was right he would be able to see his own soul, and figure out the secret of it. 

Everything was going perfect, the rune array was flawless, the carvings on his body were accurate, and due to the resilience of his scales, the pain was at a minimum. However the only problem he had faced was a small fear in the back of his mind about the after effects of the carvings and what they would do to him, yet all fear in his body was smothered out as he remembered himself as a young child watching the traveling mages weave spells in the air, he recalled his life up to this point. He had spent every waking minute studying runes, ancient arts of magic, and magics of all kinds. He studied clerical scripture , spell theorems, druidcraft, and even bardic magic conjured by sound and music. Magic was his life, and runes were his muse, his version of art, even if he could never wield them. Now it was time to gather the resources needed, He bought up spell scrolls, mana crystals, countless different component pouches and arcane focuses, everything magical he could get his hands on. Back in his so-called lab, which was really the basement of the apartment complex he lives in. He set everything up, he wrapped his body in the scrolls, treating them as more of magic batteries than anything impressive, placed the components the formula on his body called for, then set up the mana crystals in a proper array matching the runes on his body. All of his prep was done and finally he would figure out the secrets of magic, the whispers of his soul. With everything ready, he speaks the vocal component, a chant to light the fuse of the chain of runes on his body. “Throughout magic throughout logic, I defy thee now I urge you to grant this power to me” A simple chant, nothing complicated or creative yet just as the last syllable exits his mouth, the runes on his body start igniting, turning his own flesh into a spell, violating all laws of the arcane, and defying the most standard concept of survival, all for perfecting his research, perfecting magic.

Suddenly he awakes, expecting to be in a dark void with a rune of magic representing his soul in front of him, instead he awakens into a library, the lights are dim as if it was after hours, the air around him is dusty and old with an odd smell, like if food was left out way too long, long enough to rot. Slowly he makes his rounds around the library, checking a few books here and there, yet surprisingly every book he checks is blank. Which means instead of finding his soul, he's found a room full of empty knowledge without purpose, he sits leaned up against a wall trying to figure out where to go and what to do, when suddenly the smell of rot gets more pungent, as if it were drifting closer to him. With nothing better to do he decides to follow the smell, searching the library in a disgusting game of hide and seek, eventually he finds the source of the smell. A large disfigured, miss-shapen creature standing in the middle of the isle reading a tome, after about 3 pages it seems to be reading it took a sickening step, its bones crack under its own weight, its muscles convulse all over its body as with each contraction blood, puss, and a strange black ooze seep out of the creatures body. Eventually a combination of the sight in front of him and the awful smell of the creature, the previously silent volshen gags. Slowly the creature stops mid stride across the floorboards, eyes opening on its back and arms it spots him. Growing an extra set of legs from where the creature's stomach should have been it bounds over to volshen and starts walking around him, staring with both its empty eye sockets where its face should have been and with the eyes sprouting all over its arms. After a few sickening minutes of studying him, the creature makes an odd gurgling sound, as if it was trying to speak but its throat had something in it, instead it makes a quick gesture pointing at volshen, then itself; as the creature starts to walk away, yet every few seconds is pauses to look back at volshen. With the creature not outright trying to hurt him, and with nothing else to do, Volshen let curiosity overtake him and he followed this thing. After a short walk alongside the creature it eventually leads him over to a corner of the library, where hanging out from the shelf is a one too familiar tome, “runes of magic and the mystery they bring”  upon grabbing the tome everything around him fades to black, where upon opening his eyes again, He finds himself in a new room of the library with the creature sitting at the table in front of him, this time two objects rest on the table in front of him. On the left lies the tome, this time with a black rune floating above it, and on the right was a small grey figure of himself, seemingly made of stone. It's obvious he has to choose one of them, the rune or the statue? Without thinking about what the price may be he picks up the tome, the option he believes holds the future of his research.

Upon grabbing the tome everything around crumbles away, including the tome in his hand, now he is left in a void of empty, a true void, not just black with whatever else around like he expected this would be like, the only thing surrounding volshen, was nothing. Nothing was everything in the void he found himself in. There wasn't any magic or his soul like he hoped, only himself and his mind. Hours went by in the nothingness, and he pondered what all of that could have meant, did he make the right choice? What was that creature? And was all of this worth it? Finally after hours in the void he awoke, but everything was wrong. The scrolls and crystals around him had all but been depleted and ripped apart, the walls looked like they were destroyed by an owl bear, something big for sure. After the shock of waking up lifted, he finally noticed what was truly wrong, he wasn't the same shape as before. 

His body was different now, wrong if he focused hard enough he could maintain his normal shape, still have his claws and tail, yet if he lost focus on maintaining himself his arms and legs would divert into what look like weapons, even though his arm was ripping apart over and over twisting and snapping back into a new shape, it didn't hurt. The changes he was making honestly felt good to him. The tearing of his muscle fibers, the shattering of bones and claws, god it felt amazing. He didn't figure out the soul and magic like he had wanted but look at him now, he felt stronger. Though not able to wield it, he could feel his body pulsing with a magic he had never felt before, a magic so ancient it's no wonder his methods had been banned in the past.

Though his body was new, time wasn't and it still marched on, slowly he learned how to maintain his shape without constantly thinking about it, like it was second nature. Yet he still hadn't figured out magic yet, it still puzzled him, yet if his body was like this now, other people would have to be used, he would carve them just like he carved himself, after they would die he would pick them apart to find where the soul was held, was it in the brain? The heart? He never quite found out where the soul was kept just yet, but he did learn other things, like from his most recent experiment, he learned that Dragonborn's fire breath isn't actually coming from an organ, that it is in fact magical, that the organ people believed it came from was actually just a dragonborn equivalent to a second pair of vocal cords. In the same vein, dragonborn sorcerers  slightly differ from normal sorcerers as it seems their magic isn't in the blood it's in the muscle fibers, meaning a dragonborn sorcerer would on average have to consume more protein and drink more water to replenish magic then the average sorcerer, isn't that interesting? Regardless of that cool fact he had to prepare for his next hunt, experiment number 143 wouldn't catch themself.

Disposing of his hunts is always easy, typically in books they'll overestimate how difficult it is to dispose of a body, but it's really not all that hard, a quick spell scroll with any kind of fire spell will do the trick and leave you with a pile of ashes. However spell scrolls can get pricey over time, so not the best for everyone. However this method works wonders for him since volshen can craft his own scrolls, the only issue is the magic to power them but this works into his favor since after he's done with his prize from the hunt; he’ll just use whatever magic they have left to power the scroll that will ultimately be used to burn their own corpse, poetic in a sense. Even though he just finished his hunt, volshen's face though obscured held a sour scowl, his hunt was near pointless. The only thing he had gotten from it was obscure facts about dragonborn biology, since this time he tried a completely different rune array on the body. However it only gave the same results as every other hunt, no soul is secured and then he gets to just pick around the body. However, for his next experiment he had a brand new idea, instead of trying to align runes on their body to fill in the missing pieces of his own, what if he tried to make the array of runes on their body respond to his? The exact opposite of what he had been doing, however a much more selfish view of this might end up giving him huge amounts of progress. Now with this new revelation he would just have to head back to his apartment and figure out the specifics of his new idea. 

Stepping out of the shrouded alley he had commandeered for his experiment, the bright lights of the city immediately started pestering his eyes: signs everywhere with just almost clever wordplay offering some type of pointless product, countless streetlights, neon signs, bright headlights from the boats taking up the road in the normal traffic of the waterways. This city was insufferable, however he grew up here and leaving would only harm his research since without a good supply of people, the already unbearable time between his hunts would grow even longer, with every suitable subject being further away from the last. Already bored and in a sour mood, instead of walking back to his apartment, he stepped out to the edge of the walkway and lifted his arm up and raised 3 fingers up into the air, a common sign for a taxi. After waiting for a minute or two a yellow boat with black and white stripes along the side of him pulled out of traffic and drifted right up next to him, signaling for him to get in. Upon getting into the boat, the mediocrity of the taxi immediately showed itself, however it still had a working motor even if the ripped leather seats with stains from god knows what, or who would endlessly poke at him.

The driver, clearing his throat and speaking up “So where's a man like you heading at this hour?”

“Just a few blocks away, you know that bar Rocky’s?” volshen replied.

“The one with the large rock out front right?” the driver pausing for a second looking dead forward realizing he answered his own question 

“Yeah that would probably be Rocky’s.” 

After the quick exchange the boat's motor had roared to life and they started on their way, the ride itself being particularly bland just how volshen liked it, not much small talk nor any odd remarks over his clothing or mask. A simple peaceful ride on the water. Volshen after closing his eyes for a minute, taking in the quiet enjoying the change of pace from earlier today with all the screaming and hitting, slowly felt the boat come to a stop. Pearing out of the window he saw the famous Rocky’s rock, always seeming to be slighter larger than last time he came yet still underwhelmingly four feet tall. Seeing that he’s at his destination, he flicks a gold coin to the driver, grossly overpaying but who really cares? It's not his money he’s spending tonight. Stepping into Rocky's, the familiar smell of the place drifts over him. Walking up to the bar, the bartender Rrassk looks over at him, nods his head and starts preparing his usual order. 

Typically Volshen would never be caught dead stepping into a bar, due to the grossness of the place and sad fact that the only thing alcohol really does to him is it makes it harder to keep his shape, yet after a few minutes the only reason he comes to Rocky’s slides up in front of him in a plastic bowl, 3 scoops of a chocolate ice cream with fudge and some type of a velvet red drizzle over it.. Rocky’s the only bar in the city that not only serves booze, but serves ice cream. In fact, not only did they serve ice cream, they served the hands down no competition nor debate, the best ice cream in town. After getting his first order, he reaches into his coat and slides across a small black container, 2 silver, and a parchment already read countless times by Rrassk and every other bartender that works at Rocky’s. After finishing his bowl Volsehn sees  Rrassk slide back over the container, parchment and a familiar smile. Though they don't say too many words to each other, Rrassk and the rest of the staff at Rocky’s is the closest thing that Volshen has to friends. The only people that would ever notice if Volshen skipped town or gets caught during a hunt. They also don't judge him for eating with his hands, not like using them as a spoon or like a tool, but his hand slowly contorting into a mouth and literally eating with his hands. Due to the magical cursed metal plate he was scammed into buying with the promises of being able to see all that is unseen. Since he’s finished his bowl Volshen gets up, raises his hand up in a thumbs up to Rrassk, tipping him a gold piece, then just walks out without saying a word, starting his walk back to his apartment.

Back at his apartment Volshen takes a large deep sigh, and lets his shape go, his arms elongating and the fleshy bits tearing apart, his chest opening up to have a massive gaping maw in his chest, right where his stomach would be. On all fours he crawls over to his couch and sits down, letting the day drift over him. Taking just a minute to enjoy the silence of his home, he reaches over to the coffee table, grabs the remote and turns on the television. Some trashy elven dating show is on right now, just wanting to turn his brain off for a minute. Remembering something he reaches into his robes and pulls out the small black container, a magic item he had commissioned a little bit after he started going to rocky’s, anything inside of the chamber would maintain its temperature. So upon opening it up he finds another 3 scoops of his favorite treat and taking advantage of the properties of the container, a hot warm and tender slab of steak of course separated by a little divider from the ice cream. Right now, everything was relaxing, he had his two favorite foods, some shitty mindless television he wouldn't care to remember or watch again. Tomorrow he would hunt again and continue with his life's passion, his dream to figure out magic and the soul. Yet right now? He was more than happy to eat then drift off to sleep, content with his work today.",1,1757079713.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

(Yeah I know, too fast, what the hell right?) But I didn’t care, the vibe was good, it felt natural, atleast for my part. I felt comfortable around him, admired him because he was very confident about himself, he was very generous during our dates (maybe he thought yun habol ko kasi sya palagi nagastos sa mga pagkikita namin). But honestly? I just wanted good company and someone to talk to that time, someone who actually wanted me as I am without criticizing me. And that was him. 

He went abroad and I thought things would continue between us, surprised because his energy towards me changed, it felt like he was very distant emotionally, he was giving time, but he’s not as loving as he used to in person. Turns out he’s not expressive in words, just actions, okay I get it, but we’re in an LDR actions can only do so much. He needed time to adjust? Okay, i understand I’m not going to pressure you in giving time when you need to focus, but you can atleast say words of love so I know your heart is still the same for me. We’re miles away and it wouldn’t hurt to say it once in a while. 

During that time, i felt like my needs were unmet and unimportant. I felt like my needs were shallow and that love is something is demonstrated with something greater. 

But personally, love is in the little things that you do, like saying i love you kahit di ka wordy na tao. 

I still grieve that relationship until now, yung hopes ko na magtatagal, and magkikita kami ulit. I hope I can move on and let go knowing na I was never wanted and that all of it was nasa utak ko lang. i created a very romantic image of him sa utak ko. 

Edited: during that time, nung nakapag abroad na sya, I also felt like bumaba tingin nya sakin when I went through the most difficult time of my life. He didn’t know how to help me or handle it. Yun yung pinaka masakit, kasi I thought mahal nya ako gusto nya ako.",2,1757079688.0,MayConfessionAko,0,1.0,False

Don't exactly recall what I was looking at before I fell asleep but I'll assume there wasn't any video playing as I don't watch videos in bed without my AirPods in. 

So this morning the phone's dead - no surprise there. Plug in the low wattage charger at my bedside and notice after getting up and starting my coffee (15 minutes?) there's no response at all from the phone. Boy, must have really run the battery down. Plug in the phone to my 30W iPad charger and get in the shower. 15 minutes later, nothing. No response from holding down any buttons - not the power/vol to do a reset, etc.

While I appreciated its elegant features and functionality, a couple of quirks did catch my attention. Let's dive deeper, shall we?

**Eye-Catching Design and Build**

Sleek and sophisticated, this 12-cup programmable coffee maker boasts a black and stainless-steel finish that blends seamlessly into a modern kitchen aesthetic. Its compact dimensions (6.6"" x 9.4"" x 12"") meant it didn’t hog too much counter space. The stainless steel adds durability while maintaining a lightweight build, as the whole machine weighs just 3.79 pounds. The inclusion of a glass carafe was a nice touch, adding some class, though I did notice it demanded careful handling. The buttons and LCD screen felt intuitive—nothing too fancy, but they didn’t need to be. Simplicity is sometimes the kind of luxury we all appreciate before coffee.

**Programmable Convenience**

Arguably one of the distinct highlights is the programmable feature. I could set the timer the night before, allowing the machine to brew fresh coffee exactly at 6:30 AM, just as I’d stumble into the kitchen, still half-asleep. The LCD screen made adjustments easy, even for someone like my husband, who’s not exactly a tech wizard. As the aroma of freshly brewed coffee greeted us, it honestly made mornings a little less dreadful. Bonus points for the anti-drip feature, letting me grab a quick cup mid-brew without making a mess—this saved me on particularly rushed mornings.

**Brewing Strength Settings**

What sets this coffee maker apart is the option to toggle between regular and bold brew settings. With a program designed to evenly saturate the coffee grounds via its exclusive showerhead, the flavor extraction was next level. I truly felt this every time I made a strong cup for myself or a slightly milder one for my in-laws during their stay. While not every coffee fanatic might notice the difference, I certainly appreciated the ability to tweak it to perfection. Oh, and if you’re feeling adventurous, it works just as well with teas like black or Oolong.

**Easy Cleaning and Maintenance**

One feature I didn’t know I needed was the cleaning cycle reminder. Let me tell you, anything that reminds me when it’s time for maintenance and does so so subtly is a friend in my book. The flashing green light caught my attention just enough to plan a quick clean, avoiding any unnecessary calcification or buildup. Cleaning the carafe and the permanent filter was straightforward, though the water reservoir could’ve been designed to be a tad more accessible for a deeper scrub. The nonstick warming plate stayed excellent for keeping coffee warm longer, especially on those busy workdays when I couldn’t finish the pot right away.

**Two-Hour Auto Shutdown for Safety**

I cannot overstress how reassuring it is to know this machine powers off automatically after two hours. As someone prone to multitasking (or let’s be honest, straight forgetting things exist), this feature felt like a safety net. There was no anxiety hanging over my head while heading out the door, wondering if I’d accidentally left it on. Anyone with pets or kids at home would absolutely value this functionality.

**Advantages**

- Programmable timer for tailored brewing schedules  
- Bold and regular strength settings for customizable coffee  
- Compact design with an aesthetically pleasing finish  
- Energy-saving auto shut-off after 2 hours  
- Integrated cleaning reminder for easy maintenance  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The water reservoir could be easier to clean  
- Glass carafe, though classy, requires careful handling  
- The beep signaling brewing completion could be louder  

**Competing Products**

Comparing this to machines like the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 or the Ninja CE251, I found the Taylor Swoden coffee maker offered considerable value for its price. While the Cuisinart model features a more sophisticated temperature control system, its higher price tag makes it less accessible for budget shoppers. The Ninja machine, while solid, doesn't include a cleaning reminder function, which I found crucial for avoiding maintenance delays. On the flip side, competitors are slightly ahead when it comes to larger water reservoirs and faster brewing speeds. Still, for versatile brewing strength, stylish design, and efficient programmability, this product vied successfully for its spot in my home.

**Financial Value**

From what I’ve seen with similar products, this coffee maker strikes a balance between price and functionality, a true bang for the buck. You’re getting essential features like programmable brewing, strength adjustment, and safety measures without an unattainably high cost. Its cost-effectiveness becomes particularly evident when you consider how much money you’d save by ditching morning café runs.

I was recently diagnosed at my 38. Currently I do not take any medication, yet. I'm software engineer and mostly I'm able to motivate myself and do some useful work from morning until lunch time, but after that I really struggle and end up to procrastinate until my work day ends. It sucks because I have a lot on my tasks list and I want to keep working, but I just feels like I exhausted my mental energy and motivation for the day and I'm unable to do anything productive.

I understand this is something that medication can help with, but besides that what else I can try?

I often go for a walk, drink coffee, pet or walk a dog, listen to a music or a podcast/audiobook, meditate or do a short workout. Sometimes it feels it helped a bit, but more often I just slip into the procrastination. After that I'm pissed at myself because more and more work tasks are added and feels like I can't keep up with others at work. Sure I can't since I'm unable to work whole workday. 

Any method, app anything that works for you besides medication?",6,1757079430.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

Or can he? He has a VALID drivers license BTW, and still currently unless I didn’t know that it was also revoked too but as of now I have not heard anything about drivers license’ being revoked. Other than that I have not helped him financially, I mean sometimes I’ll buy him a coffee or something cute.

We met at the Melbourne concert tonight and you gave me your number. Well, I fumbled the bag and accidentally closed the contact forum before I saved it.

I just hope you see this, if you do please shoot me a DM.

its beginning to drive me away from using it but before i just make a hana bank account and deal with that annoyance, is there ANY solution for this?? or am i just cooked

1n95guj,https://i.redd.it/qybpjqxzmcnf1.jpeg,A Body Double For His Obsession (looking for free link!!),"Chapter 1


The sheets were cold where his body had been.


I watched Kane Miller slide out of b*d, his back a canvas of sharp lines and mu**le. He moved with a detached grace, an economy of motion that left no room for a lingering touch.


For a moment, I let myself remember the heat of his skin against mine, the weight of him, the rough scrape of his stubble on my neck. It was a fleeting warmth in the sterile chill of his penthouse.


He paused by the window, the city lights of New York painting a harsh silhouette. He wasn't looking at the view. 


His gaze was distant, lost somewhere I couldn't follow. It happened every time. A brief, almost imperceptible disconnect, as if the man in front of me was just a shell.


I pushed myself up on my elbows, the silk sheet pooling around my waist. The movement drew his attention. His eyes, the color of slate, met mine. There was no warmth in them, only a cool assessment.


He walked back to the b*d. His hand landed on my h*p, he pressed me back into the mattress, his weight a familiar, commanding presence. He didn't say a word. He didn't have to.


I closed my eyes and let him guide me, my body responding on instinct. I wanted to feel something, anything, to bridge the chasm between us. I wrapped my arms around his neck, pulling him closer, seeking a k**s that went deeper than the surface.


He allowed it, his l*ps moving against mine with practiced skill but no real pa**ion.


When it was over, he pulled away instantly. The space he left was cold again.


He stood and began to dress, his movements efficient and precise. He put on his watch, a dark, expensive piece that matched the coldness in his eyes. There was no afterglow, no shared silence. Just the quiet rustle of fabric as he put his armor back on.


I sat up and mechanically started gathering my own clothes from the floor. My actions felt robotic, a routine I had performed too many times.


Kane walked over to the bookshelf. His fingers brushed against a row of leather-bound classics before stopping at a small, almost invisible panel. A soft click echoed in the room. He was turning off the camera.


He stared at the hidden lens for a long moment, his expression unreadable.


I remembered the first time he asked. It wasn't a request, it was a condition. My stomach had twisted, a knot of shame and confusion. He said it was for his ""peace of mind,"" a way to remember. I was desperate. I was in debt to his mother for a sum that felt like a mountain, and this was my only way to pay it. So I said yes.


I remembered the first time we met. Mrs. Miller had arranged it. He was a ghost, a recluse hiding in this glass tower. My job was simple: draw him out. Be his companion, his muse, whatever he needed to feel human again. I was an artist, and his mother saw me as a tool to fix her broken son.


For a while, I thought I was succeeding. He was wounded, mysterious. A puzzle I was desperate to solve. I painted him, sketched him, learned the contours of his face and the shadows in his eyes. I fell for the man I thought I was saving.


The attraction was undeniable. We fell into b*d one night, a collision of my hope and his silent, desperate need. It felt real.


But the relationship came with two rules.


One: Never ask about his past.


Two: He records everything.


I finished dressing and walked over to him. I ejected the tiny memory card from the hidden slot.


""Here,"" I said, my voice flat. I held it out to him.


He glanced at it, then back at me. ""Leave it on the desk.""


He didn't care. He never did. He never watched them with me. He took them and disappeared into his study for hours.


I knew why now.


The memory of that discovery was burned into my mind. It was a few weeks ago. I'd brought him coffee, entering his study without knocking for the first time. He wasn't there, but his laptop was open. On the screen was a video.


It was me. My body, my movements, the cu**e of my back as I arched against him.


But the face wasn't mine.


It was Coral's. My stepsister. Her face, flawlessly superimposed onto my body, mo**ing his name. The video was one of dozens, a catalog of our time together, all of it altered, twisted into a fantasy he built around another woman.


He was obsessed with her. I was just the body double, a convenient substitute because I looked enough like her from a distance. The same dark hair, the same slender frame. Close enough for his technology to do the rest.


Every tender word he' d ever spoken, every moment I thought was a breakthrough, was for her. He was looking at me, but he was seeing Coral.


My heart, which had once beaten so wildly for him, felt like a dead weight in my ch**t. The love I' d nurtured had turned to ash",1,1757079349.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1n95frn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1n95frn/explore_the_best_singleserve_coffee_maker/,Explore the Best Single-Serve Coffee Maker Breville VertuoPlus,"Testing out the Breville BNV450TTN1BUC1 VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker has truly been an intriguing experience. As a coffee enthusiast, finding the perfect machine that brews consistently great coffee is like finding gold. This coffee maker, which comes with the bundled Aeroccino milk frother, promises a sophisticated coffee experience right from the comfort of your kitchen. I’ve been using it daily for a while now, and there’s a lot to share about its performance, features, and overall worth.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek design. It has this modern Titan finish that blends perfectly with contemporary kitchen aesthetics. The machine isn’t overly bulky, but it has some presence on your counter, thanks to its slightly tall height at 15.5 inches. Its build feels solid, and the adjustable water tank is a nice touch—it swivels to fit various counter layouts. Personally, I appreciated how easy it was to tuck away some other appliances to make space for it since it doesn’t occupy much horizontal area. Even with its sturdy feel, it’s light enough to adjust its position with ease, weighing only about 10 pounds.  

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Testing the machine was an absolute breeze. With a fully automatic operation mode, brewing coffee or espresso doesn’t get much simpler. You pop in a Nespresso capsule, press a button, and voilà—your chosen cup size starts brewing. One feature that impressed me was its patented Centrifusion extraction technology that reads the capsule’s barcode and adjusts brewing parameters accordingly. I initially thought this barcode-reading thing sounded like a gimmick, but in practice, it ensures that every cup is consistently brewed just right. My mornings have become quicker and so much smoother because of it.

[Find the best price for Breville BNV450TTN1BUC1 on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b01n36ugge/)

**Versatility in Coffee Options**  
If versatility is what you’re after, this machine has you covered. You’ve got four different cup sizes to choose from—1.35 oz Espresso, 2.7 oz Double Espresso, 5.0 oz Gran Lungo, and 7.7 oz Coffee. I even tried pouring over ice to make some iced coffee on a warm afternoon. Let me tell you, the range of options delighted everyone in the family. My partner prefers smooth hot espressos, while I relish a bold and strong cup of coffee. The complimentary set of Nespresso capsules included initially was a great way to explore flavor profiles. However, keep in mind that you’ll need to keep purchasing these pods since it exclusively uses single-serve capsules.  

**Pluses**  
- Intuitive one-touch brewing.  
- Adjustable tank position for maximum flexibility.  
- Quick heat-up time of 15-20 seconds, saving precious minutes.  
- Bundled with the Aeroccino3 milk frother for creamy lattes or cappuccinos.  

**Flaws**  
- Exclusivity to Nespresso capsules may not appeal to those who prefer more generic systems.  
- The capsule disposal bin fills up quickly, holding only 17 used capsules.  
- While the Titan finish looks great, it does smudge easily and needs occasional wiping.

**Performance and Consistency**  
Its performance is what sets it miles apart from less-advanced coffee makers. The end result always tastes rich, smooth, and consistent. I’ve had machines before that suffered from temperature inconsistency, but this machine keeps every cup properly hot. One small gripe is that it isn’t particularly quiet, especially during the capsule extraction process. While it doesn’t wake up my whole household, the vibrating mechanism is noticeable if you’re sensitive to sound during brewing.

**Peer Products**  
Comparing the VertuoPlus to other single-serve makers like the Keurig K-Supreme or De'Longhi Lattissima, every machine seems to shine in its niche. Keurig caters to users looking for more flexibility in using different brand pods or ground coffee. However, it doesn’t match the advanced brewing precision the VertuoPlus offers. The De’Longhi, on the other hand, rivals this machine with its enhanced frothing capabilities, but it comes at a higher price point. For those who prioritize the combination of ease of use, consistent flavor, and milk frothing at a reasonable cost, the VertuoPlus strikes an impressive balance.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Although it initially feels like an investment, I quickly realized the value it offered. Sure, Nespresso’s capsules cost a bit more than ground coffee options, but the flavor profiles make up for it. Would I have liked it to be compatible with more affordable pods? Sure, but you’re paying for quality and convenience here. The inclusion of the Aeroccino3 frother sweetened the deal—it delivered perfectly frothed milk every time, enhancing the versatility of coffee options. Whether you crave a quick espresso shot or a luxurious latte, it has something for everyone.

I moved a bunch of dishes out of the sink and counter into a plastic tub. My wife got mad because I put three reusable to-go coffee cups in the tub. She has this weird thing about putting glasses or cups in the sink. It is especially annoying because she has so much stuff cluttering up the counter, there is barely any room for anything else. Also, for the past several years, any cleaning that gets done, gets done by me. I got annoyed when she fussed and told her that she doesn't ever wash dishes so she doesn't need to say anything about how I do them. That's all it took. We were off to the races! Then as she was leaving for work, she tried to guilt trip me that she was going to be crying during her whole drive.

My birthday was on a Saturday and my husband works Saturdays, I wanted him to take it off so we could spend some time together since I’m only off work Saturday/Sunday. He didn’t make an effort to get my birthday off until a couple days before, but he wouldn’t have been able to take it off anyways because somebody else already was off, but that lack of trying in advance made me feel like I wasn’t important. We also have a WILD almost 3 year old, so I spent the day taking care of her and cleaning up. My husband woke up late that day after snoozing/turning off his alarms, so he didn’t get me coffee. Then, he ordered flowers from a nice place, but he did it the day before so he wasn’t going to be able to pick them up since he was at work. He did have a family friend get them for me after I said I was sad about the whole day. He told me that maybe I don’t think my birthday was a priority because everyday I’m his priority. He also said that he offered to make my dinner and he made me cheesecake. I feel really ungrateful, but all I wanted was coffee, Kroger flowers (I love just the baby breath bundle), and to see him.

There is this guy on my team( 38 M, single and no kids) and I have recently developed a crush on him. 😩 Hes quite attractive, very funny, and a great conversationalist. Since I started crushing on him, I have noticed things i have never noticed before.. Such as him always keeping eye contact with me even if he is talking to others. We had a summer event a few moths back and He sat at our table. He sat directly across from me and kept asking me questions and maintaining eye contact with just me. 

We had another event coming up and I bumped into him in the staff room when i was getting a coffee, the first thing he asked was if i was going and once i said I was .. His eyes lit up and he started smiling instantly, he said “oh thats great, we will have a great time”. 

He has asked me questions a few times that im 100% sure he knew the answes too. Was it an excuse to talk to me ? or am i being delusional? 

I walked past him the other day and he looked me up and down and grinned. (this has happened a few times)

This is all i have as I only started noticing recently as I only started crushing on him a few months ago.

If he does potentially have a crush on me.. Should i try and talk to him more and flirt with him in a friendly way ?

The friends I have here are mostly married or busy with kids and their own lives, so hanging out isn’t really a thing anymore.
(by hanging out i just mean try new restaurants, chitchat in coffee shops, maybe some cute and new activities idk..) 

Sometimes I go out with my fiance’s circle of friends, but honestly nothing really genuine has come out of that for me. I find it really hard these days to make real lasting friendships. A lot of people already have their own friend groups and some can be a little judgmental or unwelcoming. I also think sometimes people assume I’m stuck up or something (maybe it’s just me overthinking it) but i’m just shy and socially awkward around new people at first.. 
I struggle with knowing how to connect or start conversations, but it’s not because I don’t care.. I just get nervous and again overthink things and it takes me a whileee to open up(always depends on the energy of the person im talking to) 

I’m also just tired of the whole “fake friend” vibe? like people who only stick around when they need something or have some other agenda…

So if you’re someone who feels the same way, or you’re just genuinely looking to make a lifelong friend, I’d be really happy to get to know you and be that friend ☺️",2,1757078867.0,lebanesegirlies,0,1.0,False

I’d always felt the rush but never the anxiety until one day it hit and didn’t stop, which led me to Buspirone. Never taken anxiety medication before. 

Something similar happened back in college, but quitting coffee made the anxiety fade without meds. I’ve been drinking coffee since I was 18 (I’m 33 now) and never needed medication before. 

Could caffeine be the actual trigger, or am I just linking the caffeine rush to anxiety that comes from something else? I haven’t touched caffeine since July, but I really miss it.

We've been dating for 8 months and I thought things have been going very well. When I was out of town she would mention ""I'm meeting up with a friend for coffee"", or ""I'm meeting with my friend for dinner"" but didn't specify it was a guy, so I assumed it was one of her female friends. Recently, I found out that it was the same guy multiple times. She said ""it's not a big deal, we're just friends"" but she did admit that he invited her to his house and they ""only had a drink"". I got really angry and told her that she was cheating and that she was acting like a ho .. I am not sure I can trust her going forward. AIO?

I was emotionally cheated on and manipulated by my ex gf in the past, so I have a hard time trusting people.

They were the same company, so when the cafe was slow I re-shelved books and merchandise, that kind of stuff.

I was hired by a manager who liked me instantly. She was super chill and all the cafe employees liked her. She worked around our schedules, worked with us cleaning machines and wiping tables, she was great, but she moved and recommended one of our guys to take her spot. He was like a “sassy gay friend” movie stereotype in real life. Super catty, stirred up drama, acted like he was freaking king of the realm instead of manager at a bookstore coffee shop.

One night he overheard me and another employee talking about how things had changed since he took over. We didn’t say anything bad about him personally, just that the vibe was different, not as relaxed, how the old manager was more like one of the team.

Saturday rolls around, I’m working a double shift, and when I clock in he tells me, “Hey- I heard you and (coworker) talking about how much better your jobs were before I got promoted, and I’m so sorry you feel that way. I know you’re here all day, but you’re not making any drinks. I don’t want to see you pulling shots, scooping ice, I don’t even want you behind the counter today. You can clean tables and floors, take out trash, and reshelve the store, but I don’t want to see you making any drinks.” The bookstore was the main entrance to the mall, and this was a Saturday.

By 9:00 a short line was forming. By 11:00 it was LONG. My coworkers were shorthanded and I told them why. “Shaun said I wasn’t allowed behind the counter today.” Throughout the day angry customers in line asked me why I wasn’t back there helping. I just told them, “My manager said I can’t make drinks today. Sorry about your wait.” And I kept sweeping and refilling sugar and putting magazines and books away. A lot of people left before ordering, tips were low, and the customer frustration was obvious, and Shaun stayed in the back office most of the day. I missed out on tips that day, and I didn’t get to work the counter (which was the funnest part of the job), but I smiled and whistled the day away, putting up magazines and wiping tables, feeling a little spark of joy every time a waiting customer complained or walked out.",9,1757078660.0,MaliciousCompliance,4,0.68,False
1n956v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1n956v8/i_23f_had_recently_broken_up_with_my_boyfriend/,"I, 23F, had recently broken up with my boyfriend, 28M, and now I'm wonering if i made the right decision and my own part in the break up.","Hi, this is my first post, so I'm not 100% sure how much to write, so just bear with me. 

I, 23F, recently broke up with my boyfriend, 28M, though you could technically say we broke up mutually. We had been dating for about five months (officially), but we had known each other for over a year. We met on Tinder and our talking stage was really long.

Things were going great at first, however, my first red flag was that he didn't mention he had a daughter from a previous relationship up until our forth official date. We had been talking for a few months at that point, and while I understand that he wanted to do it in person, I still found it a bit weird. But, I decided to look past it.

And like I said, at first it really was great, I felt like he was really listening to me and paying attention to me like no other guy had before, we could talk about anything and everything and we had some similar hobby's. 

Then, our sex life took a slight hit. Normally, I'm not the type of person to directly initiate and I felt like I had communicated that (again, he might've perceived that differently). But I would put on lingerie, or I would start kissing him, but I'm just not the type of person to just go for it and grab it. So, for a few weeks we went without it and I felt absolutely horrible, until I took a more direct approach and he said 'I was just waited for you to actually do something', which frankly, kinda hurt my feelings. I understand that he might've wanted a more direct approach, but that just left a bad taste in my mouth.

Then, in late May, my father passed away. We were expecting it, because he had been ill for a long time, but when it actually came to it, it all happened way too fast. My boyfriend hadn't met my family yet at that point, so I didn't make a big deal when he didn't come to the funeral. I myself, was still a bit in shock, and when we were talking, I said that I was okay and that since I knew it would happen, that made it a bit easier. Looking back, that was a mistake on my part and I'm not trying to make excuses, but I felt like I still wasn't fully processing everything. 

We didn't see each other for about two weeks, because we was busy for both weekends, and when I came to see him, everything felt good for the most part, we even talked about vacation. 

After that, I felt a bit ghosted to be honest. No calls, no messages, nothing. Which was fine at the beginning, because we all go through that periods. So, I started calling him, but every time I did, I felt he was just annoyed with me. There wasn't anything specific, I just felt like he was. That was another two week period where we didn't see each other, because he was dog sitting for someone, which was shitty because I didn't get to see him on his birthday. 

Then, we finally did meet for coffee, he informed me he was going on a two week long vacation with the boys, which made me feel annoyed and upset, because I had thought we were going together. My mistake again, was not clearly saying that, but after weeks of trying to get him to at least meet up for coffee, I was disappointed and upset, so I admit, I did brood.

I hope that wasn't too much context. Anyway, after talking when he came back, he said that he had decided to take a step back in the relationship, because I wasn't trying enough. I didn't call enough nor did I ask him out enough time, he did it more and he didn't want to be taken for granted. Which, admittedly, pissed me off. Again, I admit that I can pull back sometimes but the fact that he didn't bother to check in on me, how I was doing after my dad's passing, made me feel like he didn't care, so I felt like calling him and talking to him would only make me feel worse, like I should've been over it, since we expected it. I might've been more sympathetic, but the fact that he had decided to 'take a step back' after my dad died, just made me feel hurt and confused, because obviously I'm not going to be in the mood to plan fun dates a few weeks after it.



So, I just want to know if my shortcomings in the relationships effected it to this point? Is it something that I'm missing and I shouldn't just blame it all on him.

Impact en kansen voor IT-organisaties

De integratie van AI in CPaaS biedt aanzienlijke kansen voor IT-organisaties.  Door slimme automatisering en personalisatie kunnen bedrijven de klantervaring verbeteren en operationele kosten verlagen. Denk aan chatbots die 24/7 klantvragen beantwoorden of gepersonaliseerde marketingcampagnes via verschillende kanalen.  MSP's kunnen deze technologieën integreren in hun dienstenaanbod en zo nieuwe inkomstenstromen genereren. De toenemende vraag naar AI-gedreven CPaaS-oplossingen creëert een competitief voordeel voor bedrijven die deze technologie omarmen.

De toekomst van AI-gedreven communicatie

1n9543y,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1n9543y/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_megachef_18/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle Megachef 1.8 Quarts Worth Buying,"The MegaChef 1.8 Quarts Electric Tea Kettle in Matte Black with Rose Gold accents landed on my kitchen counter last month, and let me tell you, this thing has style. Between its retro aesthetic and glossy finish, it’s almost too pretty to shove into a cupboard—so it earned a place of honor on my countertop. With 1.8-quart capacity and a 1500-watt power rating, it promised efficiency and elegance rolled into one. Over the last few weeks, I’ve made enough tea, coffee, and instant ramen to put it through its paces and here’s what I found, quirks and all.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The kettle’s design definitely stands out, and I have to admit, I almost felt bad using it instead of just showing it off. The matte black finish paired with rose gold accents screams sophistication—it’s like the Bentley of electric kettles. The stainless steel body doesn’t just look great; it also feels durable. Even the spout is smooth and drip-free, which is great because no one likes cleaning up puddles of boiling water. It comes with a removable filter, which is simple to clean if you’re like me and prefer your tea sediment-free. At just over three pounds, it’s lightweight enough not to strain your wrist when pouring, but it doesn't feel flimsy either.

**Performance and Speed**  
Boiling water is what kettles do, and this model doesn’t disappoint. I clocked it multiple times—1.8 quarts heats up in under five minutes, even when starting with cold water straight from the tap. The 1500-watt power paired with 120 volts seems to hit the sweet spot; it’s speedy but doesn’t feel like it’s drawing half the electricity in the house. I especially appreciated the built-in temperature gauge, which takes all the guesswork out of brewing delicate teas that need water below boiling. Between the speed and accuracy, it’s a standout performer in my book.

**Highlights**  
- The built-in temperature gauge is brilliant for tea nerds like me.  
- Powerful 1500 watts quickly brings water to the desired temperature.  
- Compact design keeps counters sleek while offering ample capacity.  

[See MegaChef 1.8 Quarts price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b0bg9b62sm/)

**Ease of Use and Features**  
I’ve been pleased at how user-friendly it is. The water level indicator is easy to read, so I never have to guess if I’ve over- or underfilled it. The cordless serving design is a blessing, especially when you’re hosting guests and don’t want cords tangling up the table display. For someone like me, who’s constantly dealing with clutter in the kitchen, the cord storage on the base is a small but impactful touch. Despite all these pluses, it’s a manual kettle, meaning you’ll flip the switch yourself, and it won’t automatically stop heating once it reaches a specific thermostat point unless it hits boil.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Cordless serving eliminates the hassle of dragging cords.  
- Thoughtful cord storage keeps your counter cleaner.  
- Boil-dry protection adds a layer of safety.  

**Negatives**  
While I enjoy many aspects of the product, it’s not without its quirks. The matte black coating, though stunning, is surprisingly prone to fingerprint smudges, which I wasn’t expecting. I’ve found myself wiping it down often, which can be a tad annoying when rushing out the door. Additionally, the lack of more advanced automation—like an auto-shutoff tied to the temperature gauge—makes it feel just slightly behind in tech offerings compared to other premium models.  

- The matte finish requires regular wiping to avoid smudges.  
- Runs manually, lacking automated thermostat controls.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Having used electric kettles in the past, I compared it with brands like Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach. Cuisinart’s models often come with more electronic controls, like preset temperature buttons, which the MegaChef doesn’t have. That said, the MegaChef wins in aesthetic value by a mile—it makes these kettles look downright boring. Hamilton Beach, on the other hand, usually boasts slightly lower prices, but I’ll admit the build quality feels noticeably less premium than what you get here with the stainless steel construction and glossy finish. Depending on your priorities (style versus tech), the MegaChef strikes a unique balance that some competitors just can’t match.

**Value Proposition**  
Is this kettle worth the investment? Personally, I think it delivers decent bang for your buck if a stylish kitchen and reliable performance matter to you. Sure, it doesn’t have Wi-Fi connectivity or a touchscreen, but it doesn’t pretend to be a high-tech gadget. The focus is on timeless design and solid functionality, and I genuinely feel I got my money’s worth. Plus, for the energy efficiency and quick boiling time, it hasn’t added much to my electricity bill. If sleek counters, stunning design, and dependable boiling are on your wish list, this is a compelling choice.

Here’s the issue: Louisiana has 60+ parishes, and from what I can tell, if I ship to a customer in a different parish, I’m supposed to register and file parish sales tax there—even if the tax due is like $0.50.

There doesn’t seem to be a true centralized filing system unless you have physical locations in multiple parishes (which we do not). 

Am I seriously expected to register and file with all 60+ parishes? How are other small online retailers handling this? Especially when the taxes total less than a dollar per parish sometimes?

How are other small online businesses handling this?

Is there a way for me to just charge Orleans parish tax? On all Louisiana orders?

1n953xt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n953xt,My Arknights Create-Your-Own-Adventure version 1.0 is finished! (fixed reupload),"For those who prefer other hosting options, here's an Imagechest link: [https://imgchest.com/p/a846d62e27x](https://imgchest.com/p/a846d62e27x)

Okay, in truth, I me\~ant to have this finished, like, four months ago... But you know how it goes, right? ""I'll try harder tomorrow"" becomes ""I'll try harder next week"" becomes ""I'll try harder next life"", and before you know it, you're a washed-up drunk sitting on a pier cursing the clouds. ...Hey, it's been a troubled few months, okay? I had to curse \*someone\*.

Joking aside, I'm not \*su\~per\* satisfied with version 1.0 - I'd like another six or so Boon choices, amongst other things. The current version supports maybe 4 or 5 archetypes depending on how you slice it, and that's including the ""you idiot"" options. A number of the boons might also be a bit too vague and situational, considering the circumstances, and I feel like there's too much conceptual overlap between several of them. I'm also still not happy with the timeline organization - I took a few stabs at dividing it up in various ways, and wasn't happy with any of them. I'm also 100% sure there's typos in there that I didn't catch; I didn't really do any proofreading between v0.9 and now. But even if I think I could still add a bit of meat to the bone, it's now feature-complete and I \*really\* wanted this out before the end of the anime and Chapter 15.

Incidentally, I didn't really add \*much\* between v0.9 and v1.0; it's mostly the Boon section and the Errata section. If you read the first one, there's not much reason to reread 90% of this.

\*\*Changelog:\*\*

\- The first version was deemed too generous with Power; Understanding's Power has been nerfed across the board.

\- Boons have been implemented

\- Errata has been added, featuring a primer for the oddballs who played this without knowledge of the game

\- Powerful new technology has been used to keep the images level with one another - sadly, no such power can rebalance my yapping

1n951ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1n951ts/investigate_if_the_best_coffee_maker_is_the/,Investigate if the Best Coffee Maker is the Nespresso VertuoPlus,"The Nespresso BNV420BLK1BUC1 VertuoPlus Coffee Maker has been a daily companion in my kitchen for a while now. Crafted by Breville, this coffee machine blends sleek design with impressive functionality. Ideal for coffee aficionados, it offers a mix of style and convenience that’s hard to ignore. Though it's become a favorite gadget in my home, there are definitely some points worth discussing about its performance and features.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this coffee maker is its minimalist aesthetic. It’s compact yet sturdy, with a glossy black finish that fits seamlessly into any modern kitchen. The water tank’s adjustable placement is a small but thoughtful feature, perfect for countertops with limited space. Sporting a motorized brew head, it’s also easy to open and close without any force. However, while the lightweight construction is a plus for portability, it sometimes made me question its long-term durability. There was a moment during the first week when I thought the water tank might be too thin, but so far, it’s held up.

**Ease of Use**  
Using this coffee maker is ridiculously simple, almost like having a personal barista in your kitchen. It features a fully automatic operation and programmable settings, so all you need to do is pop in a capsule and press a button. The complimentary set of Nespresso capsules that comes with the machine was a nice touch, allowing me to experiment with different blends and flavors right from the start. For someone like me, who often fumbles with mechanical gadgets early in the morning, the straightforward interface is nothing short of bliss. Still, the machine does depend entirely on capsules, which might not appeal to those who prefer ground coffee.

**Key Benefits**  
- Offers extremely simple one-button brewing for espresso and coffee lovers alike  
- Movable water tank caters to different counter layouts  
- Includes a complimentary sample of coffee capsules  
- Stylish yet practical design for modern homes  

[Check Nespresso BNV420BLK1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://sohdu.com/p/b01n5s8tv1/)

**Versatility in Brewing**  
What makes this product stand out is its ability to brew multiple cup sizes, ranging from single espresso shots to 8-ounce coffee cups. Mornings when I need a quick caffeine kick are covered, and lazy weekends call for a larger, more relaxed brew. The Centrifusion technology spins the capsule at high speeds (up to 7,000 rpm), blending coffee grounds and water to create a rich crema. I even tried making iced coffee by pouring an 8-ounce brew over ice, and it worked flawlessly. That said, you’re locked into Nespresso’s capsule system, which could be limiting if you value variety beyond their blends.

**Strengths**  
- Exceptional crema on every cup  
- Enables brewing for both hot and iced coffee  
- Quick 25-second heat-up saves time  
- Energy-saving auto shut-off for peace of mind  

**Negatives**  
Despite the many positives, there are a few hurdles to note.  
- Capsule dependency limits options for non-Nespresso blends  
- Plastic components might wear over long-term use  
- Individual capsules can become costly over time  
- Lacks customizable settings for coffee strength or temperature  

**Product Alternatives**  
The competitive world of coffee machines is vast, and alternatives like Keurig K-Cup Brewers come to mind. While both brands prioritize simplicity, Keurig products are generally compatible with a wider range of pods, which might appeal if variety matters to you. However, the VertuoPlus outshines similar machines in its ability to produce a luxurious crema and brew espresso—a feature Keurig brewers typically lack. Another contender, the Breville Barista Express, offers an entry point for those who enjoy grinding their own beans, but it lacks the effortless convenience Nespresso delivers. If versatility within the capsule realm is a dealbreaker, the Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker might also tempt you with its open-ended brewing options.

**True Value**  
For what you’re getting, this coffee maker brings excellent value to the table. The refined brewing technology paired with the simplicity of operation justifies its price tag. Though its reliance on capsules can add up cost-wise, the sheer convenience and quality of coffee make it worthwhile for people like me, who can’t start their mornings without a perfect cup. Its energy-efficient design is another plus, quietly slipping into standby mode when left idle, saving more than just electricity—it saves me from nagging household power complaints.

It’s a fever dream nailed to stilts, where curved walls sprout windows like fungi glowing in twilight. It feels like a treehouse crashed through an LSD trip into reality. Tourism in Cincinnati ticked upward in 2024 with a 5 percent rise in visitors, drawing around 1.2 million overnight stays according to Visit Cincinnati data, riding a broader Midwest renaissance where curious minds crave oddities, off-beat narratives, and edible miracles.

Adventure here is driving through neighborhoods whose streets twist like memory and finding a house that seems to breathe. Getting there costs nothing if walking from the city center, or USD 10 in a rideshare. Stand underneath those bulbous balconies, each one crafted like a mushroom cap, and feel your preconceptions buckle.

The best season to sneak into this surreal fungus is late spring through early fall, when the light softens, foliage flecks around the house, and the owner sometimes steps out with a soda in hand—less performance, more invitation. Winter muffles it behind barren trees and leaves the place more eerie than inviting.

Save some energy for more Cincinnati riffs. Rent a bike at USD 15 per day and pedal the Over-the-Rhine district where murals crowd bricks and street vendors sell pork belly buns for USD 5. Fell in after taste? Belly up to Findlay Market stalls roasting bratwursts for USD 8 or paprikash for USD 12. Order a local beer from a nearby brewery at USD 6 a pint and let the yeast play your senses like a harp.

If sunrise calls, paddle a kayak down the Ohio River for roughly USD 40 a half day and feel the city strain awake beneath the skyline. Then hit a coffee shop in a historic mill. A cup of strong brew at USD 4. Let the beans tattoo your brain with caffeine remembering.

Rooms hover between USD 70 and USD 120 a night in central inns with style that doesn’t outshine the Mushroom House but makes you glad to drop your bag. Weekend rates nudge higher when festivals flood the streets.

This is not travel you long for when blasé joins GPS coordinates. The Mushroom House demands you slow, breathe, and recalibrate expectation. Cincinnati’s tourism numbers may whisper growth, but you’ll talk about that house for years. Go when the air is summer-full, bring sense of wonder stretched thin, taste meat and yeast and dream. Let the Mushroom House teach you to trust landscapes that refuse to behave.

1n951lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n951lh/can_ispring_replacement_water_filters_improve/,Can iSpring Replacement Water Filters Improve Your RO System? Comprehensive Review and Insights,"The **iSpring F7-GAC NSF Certified 1-Year Replacement Filter Cartridge Pack** caught my eye because I’ve always been big on ensuring clean, great-tasting water for my home. This 7-count filter pack is designed for standard 5-stage reverse osmosis (RO) systems, and I’ve put it to the test over the past few months. While it didn’t revolutionize water filtration, it delivered reliable performance and came with its own mix of perks and quirks. Here’s the breakdown of my experience with this product.

**Comprehensive Package and Compatibility**  
One of the first things you’ll notice about this replacement cartridge pack is its complete lineup. Containing two sediment filters, two granular activated carbon (GAC) filters, two carbon block (CTO) filters, and one post-carbon filter, it’s a comprehensive set for a full year. The fact it’s designed to fit most standard 5-stage RO systems was a relief since I didn’t need to worry about compatibility or tweaking my system. The filters are neatly wrapped to keep them pristine until you’re ready to use them. I found this particularly handy because the last thing you want is already-compromised filters straight out of the box.  

[Check iSpring 1-Year Replacement Filter Cartridge Pack price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b004hl32ee/)  

**Ease of Installation**  
Replacing filters has always been a dreaded chore for me, sometimes requiring more elbow grease than I’d like to admit. This time, though, I was pleasantly surprised. The FT15 post-carbon filter in the set features a push-fit quick connection. It snapped into place without much hassle, and I managed to get everything replaced in under 30 minutes, which is impressive considering my track record. The package includes a user manual that provides clear instructions, and for anyone stuck, there’s customer support to lean on. However, I’ll admit that working in tighter spaces under the sink still felt like yoga for plumbers.  

**Water Quality and Performance**  
The difference in water quality after installation was immediate. Water was noticeably clearer, tasted fresher, and smelled, well, like nothing—which is exactly what I wanted. I noticed distinctly better coffee, tastier cooking, and even clearer ice cubes. The filters also help protect system components by removing impurities, bad tastes, and odors. These improvements were evident in daily use, and my family remarked on the noticeable upgrade in taste over our previous setup. However, the pack doesn’t include an RO membrane, which could be a dealbreaker if you’re setting up a system from scratch.  

**Upsides**  
- Packaged for a full year of convenient replacements.  
- Filters are individually wrapped for better hygiene.  
- Push-fit connection makes installation quick and frustration-free.  

**Negatives**  
- Tight spaces under the sink can still make installation tricky.  
- RO membrane is not included, requiring a separate purchase if needed.  

**Build Quality and Durability**  
Each filter is made of quality materials—mainly plastic and metal—which feel sturdy enough to withstand a year of use without any issues. Over time, I noticed consistent performance, and there were no leaks or drop in effectiveness. The filters held up well even after extended testing, so durability isn’t something you’ll need to worry about. It’s clear that the manufacturers focused on reliability, with ANSI certification providing additional peace of mind.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this set to competitors, like filters from APEC or Express Water, it fares pretty well. APEC’s filters are also reliable but tend to be slightly more expensive, while Express Water offers a complete kit—membrane included—at a competitive price. However, what sets this product apart is its ease of installation and crystal-clear instructions, something the others occasionally skimp on. That said, filters from other brands sometimes have better performance over a 12-month period, though this largely depends on water usage and source quality.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
For what it offers, the iSpring F7-GAC replacement pack delivers excellent cost efficiency. Bundling everything you need for a year means fewer trips to the store or separate orders, saving both time and money. Yes, you’ll need to buy the RO membrane separately if required, but you’re still getting a high-quality filtration system at a pretty affordable price. Given the convenience and peace of mind, it feels worth every penny for maintaining a top-tier water filtration system at home.

In searching for a good used machine (which is next to impossible to find in Atlantic Canada especially where we live), we ran across this machine, the NIBU NB- KS535, on Amazon. Amazon lists the brand as generic, but it is actually from a company called NIBU, they have a few other coffee related products like grinders and smaller machines. But we can't find any information about it, no reviews online, and we've have never seen one in the wild. Has anyone used or seen one of these before?

We have a 9 month old and my wife is breastfeeding. Prior to marriage we were having sex a few times a week, after marriage once every few weeks, since my wife became pregnant it’s been once a month after the baby was born.

Things I look up say it’s normal for a woman to have less desire for sex after a baby because breastfeeding lowers libido because of hormones and it makes her tired in general having to wake up in the middle of the night to pump. I understand all of that but I still feel rejected and have made jokes that I don’t think she is attracted to me anymore because she never wants to have to sex with me. She will be reassuring and say that is not true, she finds me attractive she is just not in the mood. The only intimacy we really have is cuddling and kissing. But we don’t even make-out, it’s just light pecks because she doesn’t want me getting turned on and have our make-out session advance to sex. I also have been a stay at home dad for the last 4 months while waiting for my job to get through my background check as I have just graduated with a doctorate. I do 90% of the housework: cooking, cleaning, taking care of the baby, shopping, ect. I also wake up in the morning to make my wife coffee and breakfast before she leaves for work. I was hoping me doing these things would let her have the energy to be more intimate but nothing is working. Now she said I have to text her “I love her” and that will make her feel sexy. Though I tell her all the time I think she looks good. 

I brought up trying to schedule sex so she will have time to mentally prepare for it, but that feels like I am forcing the issue and making her do something she doesn’t want to. She is also worried that come the scheduled time she will not want to and disappoint me further by telling me no

I don’t know what to do at this point. Do I just suck it up and accept we have different sex drives and hope our frequency doesn’t drop even more? Do I wait till she is done breastfeeding and see how it goes then? Things are only going to get worse with her exhaustion once I go back to work. ",0,1757078092.0,Marriage,36,0.5,False

For years, I've struggled to maintain focus. The Pomodoro Technique was effective, but I found that many existing timer apps only offered generic ambient sounds or repetitive BGM, which just didn't get me in the zone.

I thought to myself, ""I wish I could listen to this lo-fi mix while I'm concentrating, and my favorite podcast during breaks...""

That's why I, as a developer, decided to build my own web app called **Pomodoro Flow**.

The app's standout feature is the ability to **set any YouTube video as your background music for each session (focus/break)**.

Here are the main features:

* **🍅 Customizable Pomodoro Timer**: Freely set the duration for your focus, break, and long break cycles.
* **🎧 YouTube-Powered BGM**: Assign different YouTube URLs for each mode, like a focus playlist or a relaxing video for breaks.
* **✅ Simple Task Management**: Create a to-do list for the day and reorder tasks with drag-and-drop.
* **🎨 Themes and Sounds**: Choose from a variety of design themes, and use the built-in ambient sounds and alarms if you prefer.
* **🚀 No Signup Required**: Just visit the site and start your session immediately.

It's still in the early stages of development, but I hope it can help others who, like me, can't focus without music, or those who've tried the Pomodoro Technique but haven't found it to be a perfect fit.

I would be incredibly grateful if you could try out **Pomodoro Flow** with your favorite music and give me your honest feedback.

**Link to the app:** [https://pomodoro-flow.com/](https://pomodoro-flow.com/)

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on these points:

* Is the UI/UX intuitive and easy to use?
* What other features would make it more useful for you?
* If I were to monetize it, what model would you find acceptable? (Currently, it only supports donations via ""Buy Me a Coffee"").

Your feedback will be a huge help in making this tool better. Thank you!",2,1757077908.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

1n94w04,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1n94w04/the_sp_experience_that_made_creation_is_finished/,"The SP experience that made ""creation is finished"" click for me","Never intended to share this but I got a sudden urge so here it goes. First off, this won't be a story about how manifesting is real and you just have to ""believe."" Instead, this will be a post about choosing a reality to experience. Neville said that creation is finished and while my conscious mind has heard it countless times, I realized I hadn't actually internalized it until recently. And so, if you too are struggling to understand this very crucial part of why anything is possible and why circumstances don't matter, then hopefully, the story I'm about to share will make it click for you. Or at least get you half way there which is also a win.

It all started when I was consciously manifesting an SP I met at the gym, let's call him gym bae. Now before I get any further, I have to confess that I NEVER thought I would fall into the ""manifesting an SP"" state. In fact, for years I would roll my eyes at such posts and actively avoid any form of SP content. And now, here I am...just like the rest of ya lol. In all fairness, now that I've gone through it, I do think that I needed to experience the SP journey. Something about going through this very specific want/desire teaches you so much more about the law and ultimately, about yourself. I now see it as a gift (more of this another time). Anyways, back to the story.

Let's just say, I had it bad for gym bae and I could tell, he liked me too. We often worked out at the same time of the day which meant that we would see each other several times a week. At some point, months had gone by and neither of us had said so much as a word to each other. We would just smile and try to not catch the other one staring. Now I know what you're thinking ""girl, wHy DidN't yOu jUsT gO tAlK tO hiM?"" Because I thought to myself, 1: ""I am done being the one that initiates conversations. Nah, he can approach me."" And 2: I knew this was the perfect opportunity to use and test the law. And since there's that unspoken rule about how guys shouldn't approach women at the gym cause they may come off as creeps, I saw it as an opportunity to use my power. I suspected that was one of the reasons why he hadn't tried to talk to me yet anyway.

So what did I do? I went into SATS and imagined a scene where he finally initiated a conversation and introduced himself. This was a tad bit tricky cause I didn't know anything about him, like his name or what his voice sounded like. So I had to make it up. In my SATS scene for 3 nights, I imagined that he had approached me while I was filling up my water bottle and saying ""Hey I haven't seen you in a while."" We would get to talking and he would introduce himself to me as ""Jonathan."" Well, a few days later... I go to the gym and some random guy (not gym bae), keeps staring at me while I was working out. The real life example of a gym creep I mentioned earlier. In between my set he decides to approach me and say ""Hey I'm Jonathan, what's your name."" I just stared at him, internally rolled my eyes and thought ""WRONG GUY."" Still enjoyed this creation cause it made me laugh.

Now, here's where things get real trippy. In the beginning of this post, I touched on the importance of choosing a reality to experience. Well, after the experience with ""wrong guy,"" I wanted to turn things up and imagine something very specific about gym bae. That's when I thought, ""well how about his birthday."" Mine was approaching in a few weeks and I figured ""why not create a scene about having birthdays a week apart."" So I go back into SATS and for 3-4 days I create a scene where we are both in a coffee shop and I tell him my birthday is on the 20th to which he replies, ""no way my birthday is a week after yours."" Again, I didn't know how his voice sounded but I focused on what I did know; his face. I looped this scene over and over as I fell asleep. It's now two weeks after my birthday and I head to the gym for a workout. Gym bae is there and we lock eyes. **This next part is the intentional shift I've been trying to master since.** When I glanced over at him, instead of thinking how much I wish he would talk to me I simply said to myself ""we're already friends."" Within 3 minutes this man, who had not spoken a word to me in **months**, comes over and says ""Hey long time no see."" My mouth (on the floor on the inside), takes this opportunity to introduce myself and he does the same. And no, his name is not Jonathan but, after our introductions, we got to talking and somehow ended up talking about birthdays. I say ""mine just passed on the 20th"" to which he replies ""no way, my birthday was on the 26."" My SATS scene was playing out right before my eyes. And while some of the details didn't make the cut, the one that truly mattered, smacked me right in the face.

It reminded me that manifestation is simply choosing. Every possible version of yourself and others are readily available to us. I chose a reality where gym bae's birthday was right after mine. A random man at the gym that I didn't even know his name and just called him gym bae to all my friends. And how was I able to do that? By imagining and then choosing to be in a state where this was a fact. In another reality, gym bae's birthday is on an entirely different day in a completely different month. But I put myself into a state where it was a week from mine. And so, again, manifesting is choosing any possible outcome or state at any moment of the day because yes, creation is finished.",9,1757077877.0,lawofassumption,1,1.0,False

Manuscript will be ready next week (finalising the last edits), but I like to prepare by time

**Title**: All the finest pieces

**Genre**: Contemporary romance 

**Wordcount**: Around 96,000

**Pitch/Blurb**: Peleas Makris bumps into Thetis Thalanissos and her fierce eyes render him lovestruck. In the rushed exchange before she disappears in the crowd, he feels a spark like he hasn’t since his wife passed, leaving him with their beloved daughter. 

A rapid online-search and Peleas discovers Thetis lives in Athens. With the family’s business struggling, Peleas can’t take a vacation across the country. Luckily, the company just bought a villa to flip into a hotel there. Peleas volunteers to oversee the refurbishments. The first time he visits the property, Thetis stands at the gate. Peleas is ecstatic, until he learns she grew up in the villa and loathes it’ll be turned upside-down. Determined to woo her, Peleas proposes creating a new layout together.

Given the chance to monitor the works, she accepts. Laboring on the project brings them closer together. Still as Thetis warms up to Peleas, the threat of bankruptcy looms over him. The company demands the hotel ready and soon. If it fails, Peleas won’t be able to provide for his daughter.  He must find a compromise between Thetis’s desire to keep the villa unchanged and the adjustments required to make it guests-material—and quickly, before both the business and what he built with Thetis crumble.

**Content warnings**: Mention of past grief; mention of doxing and hate on social media; presence of a couple open-door, not very descriptive scene (I'd say 2/5 on the spice scale); mention of verbally abusive and neglecting parents

**Excerpt**: 

Peleas doesn’t remember having downloaded all these dating apps or even the last time he opened any of them. He deletes the last with a sigh of relief. 

 One less notification to worry about. Between work emails and Polydora’s updates, his phone has been buzzing non-stop the past hour. Maybe buying his daughter her own hasn’t been his best idea.

As if he could ever miss her ballet exam.

Another chirping notification and his coffee cup shakes , spilling black spots onto the review he should write about the villa the family hotel company has acquired the past month. On the screen flashes the preview of a “As per my last…” email he deletes without reading. He’ll talk about whatever with his brother Telamon or Katerina-from-Financial Control face to face.

**Preferred timeline**: By end October would be preferable

**Type of feedback wanted**: Anything you'd be comfortable providing. I already did a swap with a critique partner, so I'm more looking for the point of view of a reader. Of course, if you wish to go more in depth, that's very welcomed. 

I'm not looking for line edits, with the caveat I'm ESL, so if you maybe notice a typo/a sentence that doesn't flow well and wants to point it out, that's welcomed, but not required  


**Willing to swap**: I don't have the bandwidth right now to do a in depth critique swap (I already have a couple project to finish). However, I'm  a quite fast reader, so I'm happy to read your MS and provide general feedback the way I'd do with a book I read for fun.

They told me Cambria never existed, but I watched her die.

Now they’re coming for me.

I might already be gone by the time you read this, but it doesn’t matter, I need to tell you the truth.


My friend Cambria and I met during freshman orientation at Forester University, both pretending not to be scared.

She wore a Misfits shirt three sizes too big and duct tape around her boots — not for style, but to “hold the nightmares in” according to her.

We bonded that week over cheap coffee, obscure metal bands, and our mutual hatred of small talk.

Most nights we would put on some music and do our best impression of being rockstars much to the dismay (and eardrums) of others.

On holidays, when the dorms emptied out, we stayed behind and watched late-night horror movies together.

I missed taking turns reading Lovecraft and Ligotti stories in a deadpan British accent to see who could make others laugh the hardest before bed. 

She said stories were the only way she could fall asleep. “If I keep my own thoughts quiet long enough,” she once whispered, “they don’t find me.”

Cambria wasn’t just my best friend; she was the only person who ever made reality feel negotiable. So, when she disappeared three weeks ago, I knew something was horribly wrong.


The university claimed she’d gone home for a “family emergency” but the problem with that excuse was that Cambria didn’t have a family. 

She had no parents, no siblings…only me.

Her foster records were a complete mess. Hell, half of them didn’t even match her last name.

I remembered calling her phone repeatedly but every time I did, it went straight to voicemail.

I tried texting her in the hopes that she would eventually:

“Please tell me you’re okay.”

“Where are you?”

“What’s going on? Can you please call me?”

But the bubbles stayed green, signaling that they hadn’t been delivered.

No one else seemed to be that bothered by her disappearance.

All the professors shrugged, her roommate was quietly reassigned, and what was once hot gossip on university campus eventually quieted.

I tried to log into Cambria’s student email, but the login screen said — “User not found.”

When I checked her dorm, someone else was living there — a girl who insisted she’d been there the whole semester.

I went to campus police, but they told me that if she went home due to a “family emergency”, there was no point in investigating. 


That night, I lay in bed, rereading the last text Cambria ever sent me over and over again:

“I’m looking into something I found here on campus. I’m going under to fight, not surrender. If something happens to me… don’t go looking.”

Was this about the sleep study she talked about signing up for on campus? I remembered her telling me about it once.

“I thought maybe they could help me shut the nightmares out for good.” Was her reasoning for participating.

I never took it seriously — we used to get high and joke about our sleep paralysis demons like they were nothing more than memes. 

But now? I’m not so sure.


I woke up later in the night to the sounds of beds creaking — one after another, slowly.

All down the hallway in sync.

Confused, I crept to my door quietly and cracked it open to see students filing out of their rooms — maybe fifteen, maybe twenty — moving in complete silence.

Their eyes were half-lidded, arms limp at their sides. They had that eerie weightlessness you see in the movements of sleepwalkers — like the body’s running on instinct instead of thought.

Their footsteps clacked in a soft, dragging hush across the linoleum as I tried to process what exactly I was witnessing.

Jenny, one of the girls from down the hall, passed my door. 

Her lips moved, barely audible.

“Vel-kirash...”

It sounded like a breathy, nonsensical syllable…not like a word.

I wanted to step out and speak but I stood frozen in the dark, watching them walk in unison down the stairs until they disappeared into the dark…


The next morning, it was just like any other morning on campus.

No one remembered anything about the events of that night.

I casually asked around to see if I could get a better understanding of what I saw.

“Did you have any weird dreams last night?”

I received blank stares, a few laughs, and a lot of questionable looks.

Everyone seemed to think I was the crazy one.

However, I did receive a lead from a random person on campus who told me to check out the campus sleep study. It was apparently Forester University’s “best-kept secret”.


Following this lead, I started doing my own investigating. 

First the obvious stuff — sleepwalking, parasomnias, sleeping disorders, anything to rationalize dozens of students rising at the exact same time and leaving in total silence.

I found clinical reports of people cooking meals in their sleep, walking into traffic, even driving cars. But nothing like the coordinated, synchronized sleepwalking that I saw.

I searched forums, niche message boards, and scraps of the deepest parts of the internet. 

Nothing.

I decided to turn my efforts to the university website, specifically the sleep study that Cambria had mentioned. 

The sleep study was there — kind of.

I found it tucked away under an archived projects folder in the psychology department. It was called, “The S.S.M. Protocol — “Sleep State Manipulation.” and it was supposedly terminated two years ago.

There were no names of any participants listed, but the folder was labeled “Group C.” 

I couldn’t shake the thought — C for Cambria?

There was a single faculty advisor whose name was associated with the project: Dr. Isaac Trenholm.

I recognized his name— he was one of Cambria’s neuroscience professors.

I searched his name and discovered that his faculty profile was gone.

The only result I could find was an old PDF titled: “On Induced Conscious Dissonance During REM Cycles.”

It was forty pages of dense medical jargon, but one paragraph jumped out at me:

“In a guided hypnagogic state, the mind can be gently urged with the word “Vel-kirash” (translation: to hollow the vessel so the womb may be filled) to accommodate a second tenant. Dream entities cannot enter the waking world unless the mind is first emptied as it is only dangerous when paired with autonomy. A lucid mind can be a prison — or a doorway. We are simply… opening the door.“

There was that word again.

Vel-kirash. 

What was Dr. Trenholm talking about? What was he hoping to accomplish with this?

I thought about the text messages Cambria sent me and how she could have known something was wrong with the sleep study. 

I think she volunteered to go under — thinking she could resist whatever it was they were doing.

She didn’t just fall into this, she tried to stop it, but it cost her everything.


That night, at 2:33 am, the beds creaked in a dreadful domino-like rhythm as the students got out of bed and began walking.

Instead of watching, I followed closely behind this time.

The procession moved past the quad toward the faculty buildings, their bare feet slapping softly against the pavement. 

My heart pounded as I mimicked their pace behind a tall boy from my statistics class. 

His head lolled slightly as he walked, his jaw slack as he whispered under his breath:

“Vel-kirash…vel-kirash…”

They stopped at a locked maintenance gate on the east side of campus. A student stepped forward and pressed her palm flat against the metal. The lock slid open, the gate opened, and they walked inside.

I froze at the entrance,  the air seeping out was sour and carried a faint chemical sting that burned my nostrils.

One of the students turned her head towards me. Not all the way — just enough that her half-lidded eyes brushed over me. 

For the first time, I thought I saw recognition flicker there. 

“Vel…” she whispered.

My pulse spiked as I stepped back too quickly. I panicked and tripped over my own foot, the sound echoed, causing every head in the group to turn at once.

Their eyes glinted in the dim lamplight; dozens of slack faces locked onto me.

I bolted, my footsteps thudding across the concrete as I ran. 

Behind me, their murmurs swelled into a chorus of chanting. 

It chased me across the quad, growing louder even though I didn’t dare look back.

By the time I reached my dorm, the chanting had stopped — but I didn’t dare close my eyes.

I never took my eyes off the hallway the rest of the night.


I’d seen them walk at least three times before I finally followed.

It wasn’t courage that made me wait — it was cowardice. I kept telling myself I needed more information, more proof.

The truth is, I wasn’t ready to go where she went.

Not yet.

However, my mind was made up.

The longer I waited, the more I felt her slipping away, like the world was actively forgetting her.

I was terrified that if I waited too long, I wouldn’t even remember who I was trying to save.

That’s what motivated me to practice in my room until I could mimic the limp limbs and shallow breathing of the unconscious mind.

I practiced in the mirror, swaying with eyes cracked just enough to see — until I couldn’t tell the difference between pretending and becoming something hollow.


At exactly 2:33 a.m., when they rose from their beds to sleepwalk, I slipped into the hallway and joined them.

The hallway was already full when I stepped out. No one said a word or looked at me.

We moved together, barefoot — a slow procession of blank faces and slack limbs through the dark.

Outside the campus, the air was colder and dense like underwater pressure.

The lamplight didn’t stretch as far as it should’ve across the sidewalks as we crossed the quad.

The soft rustle of fabric brushing against fabric filled the air as we passed the fountain and moved toward the edge of campus…towards the old biology lab.

Its windows were boarded, and chains were wrapped around the doors where a “DO NOT ENTER” sign hung crooked, the red ink sun-bleached into pink.

One of the students in the front of the pack reached out and touched the chain.

There was no rattling, no snapping, it simply fell apart, causing the doors to swing open on their own.

Inside, we passed through narrow, decaying corridor as the doors shut behind us.

Fluorescent lights hummed and flickered overhead. One buzzed so violently it went out — then stayed dark for a full minute.

In that darkness, I felt the breath of one the students upon my neck.

When the light returned, the hallway was unchanged, but I couldn’t stop shaking.

The walls were graffitied with symbols, spirals, intersecting circles, and vertical slashes through unfamiliar letters.

One design had been scratched out — the plaster gouged deep, like someone wanted it erased.

Then came the stairs.

A narrow, concrete stairwell slick with condensation and no railings led us down.

Every step echoed like we were walking inside a throat

A girl near the back — I think her name was Tanya — was bleeding.

A thin trail of blood dripped down one ankle, where she must’ve stepped on something sharp.

No one looked at her.

A flickering light above us died again, and in that moment of darkness, I heard a voice echo faintly from inside the pipes:

“Vel-kirash...”

The syllables bounced off the walls strangely. It was as if they were being spoken in reverse.

When the light came back, everyone kept walking.

No one reacted.

The walls shifted gradually from cinderblock to smooth, cold stone as we traversed across the uneven floors.

And then...we reached the lab.

Or maybe it wasn’t a lab anymore.

Maybe it never was.

At the center of the room was Cambria, her breaths heaving and erratic and before her, chanting in what seemed to be an ancient language of sorts was Dr. Isaac Trenholm.

She wasn’t strapped down; she chose to be there.

But she wasn’t winning.

Whatever she’d hoped to fight… was winning.

The room echoed chanting as we stood at the edges of the chamber.

The other students had their eyes closed, heads bowed, not watching the transformation; but feeding it by reciting the incantations.

Each word and breath tightened the noose around her fading heartbeat.

The carved symbols on the walls pulsed faintly, glowing a sickly green in time with the chants.

The thing inside Cambria was not merely emerging — it was consuming her from within.

Her lungs convulsed. 

Something slithered beneath the skin of her ribcage, coiling and uncoiled like a worm as it pressed against her heart.

Spider silk like tendrils entwined with her blood vessels, siphoning the life from her body as she twitched involuntarily.

I watched through squinted eyes as her muscles spasmed in a desperate attempt to let out a scream that she couldn’t. 

She silently mouthed a desperate “help me” from her cracked lips.

I wanted to cry out her name and tell her I was there but instead, I watched in horror.

Her eyelids fluttered in anguish as something tore free.

Dr. Trenholm staggered forward as the cracking of Cambria’s skull filled the chamber, his face shining with sweat. 

His lips trembled with joy as if he were watching a miracle being performed. 

His hands shook not with fear but anticipation as the creature, slick with afterbirth, tore itself free.

Trenholm exhaled a sigh of relief as it emerged from her skull, its skin thin, translucent, and showing twitching veins.

Tears dripped from the corners of her eyes and down her cheeks as its limbs moved in all the wrong ways, jerking violently.

Her fingers twitched and curled into a fist, then opened like a flower wilting in fast-forward.

For a second, her eyes cleared — no longer glassy but wet with terror. 

She looked at me, mouthed my name — and for a moment, she was there. 

Then she was gone.

The creature’s mouth twisted into a terrible imitation of a smile, but it wasn’t a face built for warmth.

And then, a barely audible whisper:

“Don’t wake up...”

The words pierced me, a desperate plea, and a warning all at once.

The creature’s head snapped toward me with impossible speed.

Its vacant, half-formed eyes locked onto mine, and I felt a cold click inside my chest.

I couldn’t stop the scream.

“Get her!” Dr. Trenholm commanded, pointing at me.

I didn’t think, I just ran as fast as I could.

My feet barely touched the floor as I sprinted through the darkness, the air thick and suffocating with the metallic tang of blood and chemicals.

The creature’s claws scraped against the steel and concrete, leaving deep gouges in the walls as it crawled in pursuit.

I raced down the corridor, my breath ragged as the emergency lights flickered and threw warped shadows across the walls.

My chest tightened as the sound of footsteps dragging softly but deliberately just out of sight grew louder behind me.

All the students from earlier…they were hunting me as well.

Behind me, the creature let out a wet, gurgling rattle as it pounced, its ice-cold claws grazed my shoulder.

I twisted away, my shirt ripping as I felt warm blood drip down my back.

My lungs burned.

My legs felt like lead.

I could hear the creature’s movements close behind. I turned to see its limbs dragging and then snapping forward unnaturally fast like watching stop-motion in real time.

The students were practically breathing down my neck but the adrenaline coursing through me wouldn’t let me stop.

A door ahead shimmered faintly and desperation made me sprint for it with everything I had. I slammed into it with all my weight and finally burst out into the cold night air. 

I kept running beneath flickering streetlamps that buzzed and sputtered like they were dying. Every step I took felt heavier, the world around me tilting just slightly off balance.

My heart hammered like a frantic drum as I collapsed onto the cracked sidewalk, gasping for air as I dared to look back. 

The building loomed silently behind me, its boarded windows like dead eyes watching my every move.

As I caught my breath, the cold night air hit me harder than before.

Somewhere inside, the creature and the others waited.

I know the truth.

I know what I saw.

I never went back, and I’ve been running ever since.

I found her…and I failed her.

I wonder if she was still in there when it happened.

If the last thing she felt was pain or if she was already gone — carved out, emptied like a house no one remembers living in.


I’m at a bus station, three states away. 

My cards don’t work and friends say they don’t remember me. 

Last night, I thought I saw someone followed me to the motel.

I locked the door, wedged a chair under the knob… and still, I heard it. 

At 2:33 a.m., a harsh whisper through the vent: ‘Vel-kirash.’

If you’ve ever dreamed of stairs that only go down, don’t follow.

Run.

1n94s0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1n94s0h/i_worked_with_a_36yearold_intern_who_refused_to/,"I worked with a 36-year-old intern who refused to answer directly, accused me of things I never said, and just walked away.","I’m in my 40s and work in PR/marketing for an investment company. ( in a non-English-speaking country). Here age matters at work. Usually the boss is older and it’s almost never the case that a new hire or intern is older than their manager.

The company I joined went through a rough time. The country of our company's headquarter went to war, funds collapsed, new investments stopped. To survive we had to find other money. I suggested we use my PR/marketing skills to do external projects. Somehow it worked. We made enough revenue that the company even spun off a new subsidiary and made me a director.

But it's only two-man company so far (the CEO and me), we still share the office of the parent company. We had just enough revenue to pay my salary, not enough to easily hire another full-time person. Honestly, I was a lousy leader, I don’t like leading people, nor am I good at it

Then one day my CEO told me that I had to receive the intern. it was from one of our important partners. Later, it turned out this intern was the partner’s friend’s son

I saw the résumé: 36 years old, just graduated. Turning 37. Normally interns here are 21 or 22. He spent his 20s in service jobs (like café manager), then at 31 his wealthy parents sent him abroad to study. Not even in an English-speaking country, so his English was weak. which is problematic for me because all my clients use English.

Interestingly, His college was not a really good one, it's just so-so or mediocre university, I don't think it's valuable to start a bachelor degree at 31 for that college, If I went to Harvard or Oxford for a bachelor degree on my 31, it wouldn't be really valuable. But His college is definitely lower level. If my cousin went the school at18, I would encourage her to go there but study hard to transfer to a better one, But for 31, Nope.

One more thing that disappointed me was his major and GPA, it was relatively low and not relevant with my job. I didn't find any reason to bring him to my company.

But his father's friend, the partner pushed him into my team, I couldn't refuse,

To be fair, he worked better than I thought. He worked well in research tasks, he was diligent, kind of stable because of his age. We even got along decently, coffee, drinks, etc. I even thought maybe I could hire him for real. If I later hired someone younger he could become a middle manager. I’m older than him, so age wasn’t the problem.

When the internship was near the end I asked him if he wanted to stay. He wouldn’t give me a straight answer. Just said “I should tell my will to the partner first, please ask him a bit later.” The partner was not responsible for hiring, but The intern wanted to speak through him instead of direct speaking. So I checked, partner said he hadn’t heard anything, the partner asked me about how the intern is doing, so I answered he is fine, then partner requested me to hire him. I was confused whether this intern wanted to stay or not..

At some point I told him clearly: *“That partner is respected, but he has no authority over HR here. No influence. The decision is ours, so you need to tell me directly.”* After repeating this a few times, finally he told me no, he didn’t want to continue.

Then it got worse. The partner later claimed I insulted him, saying he was *“useless, like a rock on the street.”* The intern said he “heard me say it.” Haha, I never used that expression, I’ve never insulted that partner, whom I barely know. We met only two or three times in 3 years, The message I sent him regarding checking intern's will was my first personal contact. I have no reason to disgrace him. But the intern insists that I used that insulting expression, there were no voice recordings or anything

However, there was no proof either way. My CEO told us it didn’t matter who was right; what mattered was that the company couldn’t afford to upset this partner... so three of us went to apologize at his office. It was humiliating and ugly, I had to apologize for words that I never said..

When we actually met, the partner realized I would have had no reason to insult him. He concluded it must have been a misunderstanding. He decided not to make it an issue anymore. Anyway, he cared more about the Intern's future, he asked me again how I thought of the intern and whether we could keep working with him.

I admitted honestly that the intern had worked well, and I even said I had once thought about hiring him. Together with my CEO and others, we told the intern we were willing to keep him on if he wanted to stay. At that moment, I agreed to give him another chance, despite everything, but the intern still didn’t give a clear answer.

After that, my relationship with him soured. He started pushing back on instructions, claiming I changed my words. I began using email and messenger only, so there was a record. He complained about that too, saying it was unnecessary. So I answered it would improve communication between us.

Anyway, I finally got a clear answer from him he wanted to quit. I was really happy but I didn't show how I felt in front of him, to protect my ass. At least he spoke to me first, I didn't push him to quit.

In order to wrap up this mess, I gave him an official handover format to complete. He ignored it and just sent a random file. When I confronted him, he raised his voice, claiming I never told him to use the format. I literally showed him my emails and reminders, but he kept insisting he misunderstood, so it was my fault. I snapped and raised my voice too. He left without any proper handover, and I avoided even a farewell lunch because I couldn’t stand seeing him anymore.

**In hindsight, I came to see his background this way:**

He came from a wealthy family. His siblings are successful, but he wasn’t. He went to a low-class college and parents disliked that, but he wasn't successful in second and third try, then he quit his school and started working in Cafe.

His parents are very oppressive and violent. The intern told me while we were drinking, his mother slapped him 30 times to force him not to go to his job, the intern was 29 at that time so he had to wear a mask and sunglasses to work in a dark Cafe.. he said father was much more violent than mother, the intern didn't tell me about his father's behavior. This family decided to send him study abroad, they chose his major and college instead of his choice, actually he was accepted by the other university which was in higher ranked, but parents didn't allow him to go there, because the major he wanted to have didn't look good for making money.

I never understood the story I heard, beating the son the age of 29 and pick a major of son when he was 31? even they downgraded the college level.

After this conversation he got a call from his mother and he told me he should go back to home now, it's 8pm.. so, 36 years old fully grown up man is requested to come back home early and safely. I let him go.

Now he says he’ll study for a notoriously difficult exam fresh college graduates spend years preparing for. This exam is absolutely not related with his major nor his interests. I am sure this is not his wish, it's parent's wish.

Thinking about it just made me frustrated and sad, the intern was stuck in permanent adolescence. He went to an overseas college at 31, then parents fully supported everything, he even got a car in a country very notorious for the high cost of maintaining one. Although he got the all the supports, he failed to get a job there so returned, then family made him to get an intern opportunity. Interestingly he did a job with me pretty well but he realized that the intern's salary is smaller than the pocket money he received. So he wants to quit the job but he was afraid of parents, so blamed me for things I never said.

Now he achieved the family's support again. he will study the exam which is unattainable for him.. but at least he can get a support for a while. His parents are getting old, so he can endure the slapping a bit easier.. and finally he can wait for inheritance.",1,1757077584.0,recruitinghell,1,1.0,False

1n94ruy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1n94ruy/showcase_best_coffee_machine_performance_with/,Showcase best coffee machine performance with West Bend 58030,"Brewing coffee in bulk for a crowd isn't something I usually have to deal with, but when the opportunity presented itself, I couldn't resist testing the West Bend 58030 Coffee Urn. This distinctly silver, polished aluminum coffee urn, marketed to deliver 30 cups in just 30 minutes, seemed perfect for community gatherings, office events, and even my cousin’s impromptu weekend family brunch. While I wasn't expecting a significant upgrade over a traditional coffee pot, I was curious about its features, usability, and whether it justified space on my kitchen counter.

**Sophisticated Design Meets Practicality**  
At first glance, the highly polished aluminum body of the coffee urn caught my eye. It looks modern yet classic, blending well into my kitchen's silver-centric aesthetic, although it had a sort of utilitarian vibe. The stay-cool base was a pleasant surprise; not once did I have to worry about accidental burns when moving it from one spot to another. The secure locking cover proved effective at keeping coffee from splashing out, especially when I accidentally bumped into the counter. It’s worth noting the unit’s size is on the larger side. Measuring 10.8 inches in width and depth and standing at 15.6 inches tall, it draws attention and definitely wouldn’t fit neatly into narrow storage spaces.

**Performance and Brewing Speed**  
The promise of brewing 30 cups in 30 minutes had me intrigued, so I pulled out my trusty timer during my first run. True to its claim, the coffee maker brewed coffee at a cup-per-minute pace, making it perfect for those high-demand situations like office parties or family reunions. Once brewing was complete, the urn automatically switched to a keep-warm mode—a feature I truly appreciated since it meant steaming coffee was available without needing constant reheating. Oh, and the ready indicator light was a delightful touch for me since I tend to wander off when multitasking during brewing.

**Check West Bend 58030 Coffee Urn price on Amazon.**

**Ease of Use That Even a Rookie Could Appreciate**  
Operating the coffee urn was a breeze, even for someone like me who's far from a coffee machine geek. The built-in in-basket measuring guide saved me the stress of fumbling around with scoops. I basically filled it, hit the buttons, and walked away—how much more convenient could it get? Another detail I liked was the no-drip spigot. It worked as advertised, pouring into cups smoothly without leaving rogue droplets behind. Trust me, it matters when you're wearing something you don’t want coffee stains on. The continuous flow option for filling larger coffee servers was another thoughtful addition, saving extra effort when bulk-serving.

**Good Aspects of the Coffee Urn**  
- Delivering coffee at a consistent cup-per-minute pace.  
- Automatic temperature control keeps the coffee warm and ready to serve.  
- The no-drip spigot adds comfort—no messy counters or stained tablecloths.  
- Lightweight, even when filled, making transport moderately easy.  
- Simple to operate, catering to both novices and seasoned coffee-lovers.  

**Flaws That Should Be Considered**  
- Its polished aluminum finish, while attractive, tends to show fingerprints and requires diligent cleaning to maintain appeal.  
- Rated only for light-duty use, so not built to withstand heavy commercial demand.  
- The 30-cup capacity, while acceptable for most functions, may fall short for extremely large gatherings.  
- Storage challenges arise due to its size, particularly in smaller kitchens.

**Alternative Products Worth Exploring**  
Comparing the West Bend model to some others was enlightening. For instance, the Hamilton Beach 45-Cup Coffee Urn has a slightly larger capacity, which might appeal to those hosting bigger crowd events. However, I found that its overall construction lacked the sleek finish of the West Bend coffee urn. On the flip side, the Cuisinart 12-Cup Coffee Percolator, while not designed for massive capacity needs, wins in aesthetics and countertop-friendliness. The West Bend coffee urn, however, strikes a brilliant balance between capacity and classic functionality, making it tailored for small to mid-sized gatherings.

**Quality for Price Consideration**  
Evaluating its features like automatic temperature control, cup-per-minute brewing, and ease of use, this product seems to hold its own in the market. While there are less expensive options that might cut some corners, the durability of the polished aluminum, the no-drip spout, and its user-friendly design seem to justify a bit of a higher price point. It's a reliable investment for occasions that demand efficiency without compromising on coffee quality, even for those who brew coffee casually at home but need flexibility for larger events.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Coming from a Nespresso OL and am happy to use fresh roasted beans again and avoid capsules.  My questions are mainly regarding dosage...

\- How does the machine figure the dose?  Is it solely based on the 'strength' setting?  

\- What's the best way to brew a good 6oz or so cup of coffee?  Previous coffee machine was a Keurig.  On a couple of test runs, setting the amount of water to 5-6 oz, yielded an average at best cup of coffee, maybe to watery tasting still, a little better on the strongest setting.  Grind is set to #3 out of 6 currently.  

\- Back to dosage, it's capable of a dose between 5 - 16grams, that's a big swing, again is this adjusted only using the strength amount?  Does that change whether you are making espresso or coffee?  

So far we're satisfied with the espresso shots, not so much with coffee.  We are using locally roasted beans (Northshore Boston area) which are a mix of Columbia & Brazil and is a medium-dark roast.

This question is mostly focused in **Hunter: The Vigil 2e**, but I ask it here because I know there are a lot of games that thrive in players taking their time to think, plan and prepare before acting.

And is basically what it says in the title: How to motivate/help players to do that things and so obtain the advantages of planning and ambushes instead of, the moment they know *where* the monster is grab their weapons and run to the storehouse.

And this isn't, I believe, players ""wanting action and not being slow"", they can take their sweet time in slice of life scenes, talking about coffee and even *investigating*. The problem comes that the moment they learn ""monster is here"" \[that by itself opens an entire new avenue of investigation possibilities, at least to learn the makeup of the place and how to set an ambush\] they immediately jump the gun.

So wanting to see ways to incentive stuff. I have talked with them and they *seem* to understand, just not how to make it in practice. It still fun for me, but I feel they are accidentaly kneecaping themselves and a character will end dead sooner than later.

✨️ THE SERVICE ✨️

Very small shop, hole-in-the-walley siya so for come and go lang gid. May pa beeper sila magorder ka so pwede ka gid kaguwa while waiting for your drink. Very cheap matcha (100 with oat sub)

🍵 THE MATCHA 🍵

Probably the sweetest I've had in Bacolod. It tastes rice-y but way too sweet for my liking. It even tasted a bit burnt. Honestly wala ko na ubos kay very umay siya. A bit grainy but maybe because padali kay damox2 customers pagkadto ko. 

🍪 THE FOOD 🍪

They have cookies pero I didn't buy kay bag-o lang ko tapos lunch and just needed a quick matcha fix 

❗️ OVERALL REVIEW ❗️

If newbie matcha drinker ka and fear that it'll be bitter, then Ritwal might be okay for you, especially if may sweet tooth ka. Budget option man siya considering it's price but for matcha fanatics, this one might not be for you. Their coffee's better tbh I like their popcorn latte.

1n94ley,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sicklecell/comments/1n94ley/how_to_use_distraction_as_a_tool_to_manage/,How to Use Distraction as a Tool to Manage Debilitating Pain,"
When you're dealing with debilitating pain, it can feel like your entire world shrinks down to that one sensation. The pain becomes the main character, and everything else is just a supporting role. But what if you could change the script?
Distraction isn't about ignoring your pain or pretending it doesn't exist. It's about giving your brain another job to do. Pain signals are powerful, but your brain's attention is a limited resource. By focusing on something else, you can lessen the intensity of the pain you perceive. It's a psychological tool that can be a game-changer when used alongside other treatments.
So, how can you do it? The key is to find activities that are engaging, immersive, and require cognitive effort.

Here are three categories to explore:

1. The ""Sensory Overload"" Method:

Engage multiple senses at once to create a powerful competing signal.

Listen while you create. Put on a powerful, immersive soundtrack or a compelling podcast while you draw, paint, or work on a puzzle. The combination of visual, auditory, and tactile input can be incredibly distracting.

Immerse yourself in nature. Go for a gentle walk, focusing on the sights, sounds, and smells around you. The rustle of leaves, the feel of the sun on your skin, the scent of the air—it all gives your brain new things to process.

2. The ""Cognitive Challenge"" Method:
Give your brain a puzzle to solve. This forces your mind to focus intently on a task, leaving less room for pain.
 * Learn a new skill. Whether it's playing a simple tune on a harmonica, knitting a scarf, or learning a few phrases in a new language, the satisfaction of a small accomplishment can be a powerful distraction.

Dive into a captivating story. An absorbing audiobook or a truly gripping novel can transport you to another world, effectively moving your mind away from your current reality. (Of course, many of you who follow my posts have seen me present stories to entice and distract from pain.)

3. The ""Pure Joy"" Method:

Do something that brings you genuine happiness. This releases endorphins, which are your body's natural painkillers. I also practice this method, which helps you to forget about your pain even for a moment.

Watch something funny. Laughter is a fantastic way to flood your system with positive feelings and change your body's chemistry. Be careful with this though, for laughter can ultimately bring forth more pain. But it is still a reliable means of distraction.

Connect with others. I think this one is what brings us here to r/Sicklecell. You can call a friend, engage in a video chat, or meet a loved one for coffee. Social connection is a powerful antidote to the isolation that pain can cause. Again this is all relevant to the level of pain one might be grappling with.

The more you practice these distraction techniques, the more effective they become. Start with small moments and build from there. The goal isn't to make the pain disappear, but to reclaim some of your focus and remind yourself that you have more control than you think. The mind is in fact a very powerful mechanism.

Reflections:

Which of these methods do you concur with in your moments of unresolved physical pain?

*Please share the techniques you've come across to help deal with annoying chronic pain. Whether it's from the aftermath of a bad crisis, or you're just starting to experience the effects of a moderate crisis, what other methods can we add to this to help us distract ourselves from the pain momentarily?

I have a really bad voice that just makes you instantly funny, weird and repulsive. I cannot describe here how bad it is. I also have a very poor diction (I sometimes speak very fast and ""swallow"" parts of the words or whole words) and often people make me repeat the things I said. I did not mind it that much before but I've moved overseas where I need to speak English all the time. And for months, I do not remember a conversation where people got something I said in the first time. Now, repeating even very brief interactions (coffee order) for a third-time started to become really annoying. I also realized that I have no chance of socializing or improving my social anxiety a bit where no one can understand me and asking me to repeat even decreases my already low self-esteem. And the problem is not my accent, it is very plain, it is me that cannot even manage to talk.

Has anyone struggled like this before and if you manage to overcome, do you have any tips for improving my diction and also my voice that I can practice on my own at home?

Just pure experiences, please (let's leave speculation for another chat). If you've stopped taking it (besides recommend by your doctor deadline) - care to share why?

Started taking 6000mg Ashawagandha capsules as a ""downer"" for stressful days & Korean Red Ginseng as an ""upper"" for tired days. It seems to help but I have to play it by the ear for now. 

I used to be a complete mental wreck - overreacting, overthinking, overbearing, defensive, argumentative, prone to suicide. One day I could no longer keep battling my head - ended it all but got saved. Ever since, I don't drink alcohol, don't take any stimulants (besides a cup of coffee for early mornings & occasional ginseng), & generally keep an active lifestyle. Just really trying to regulate my once wild hormones & stay busy with working 12+ hours/day on top of hangling livestock, pets, & housework at home. 

Despite taking on a lot of pressure, Ashawagandha & Ginseng seem to help (+Magnesium & two puffs of joint before bed). Yesterday, I've rolled my foot walking dark basement stairs & instead of focusing on pain or flipping about having to do too much into the late night, I just laughed & said to myself: ""So what? 😄"". I don't drive as aggressively as I used to, I don't overthink nearly as much as I used to. I do find myself feeling a bit more numb &, perhaps, a bit too calm to the point it becomes a bit scary but I'm starting to think that maybe that's how we're supposed to feel as humans? Feeling like my several-year buildup of cortisol is finally getting released. This is such a relief. An unknown & scary one.

I have been dealing with EM (we (rheumatologist and derm) are assuming secondary d/t ankylosing or psoriatic) for about 4 years and it is only getting worse each winter. Started with just feet, then progressed to more severe in the feet and hands, and now it is affecting my ears, even as early as August this year. Once temps start to dip into the 40s and 50s, I get light burning/itching/flushing in my toes. Once the temps start to dip lower, the pain becomes more intense to the point that I can no longer walk in the evenings without limping due to the shards of glass pain in my toes. I am a chiropractor and I work with my hands all day - they become really hot and red/purple and uncomfortable. 

In the warmer months I am without any symptoms at all. I can exercise, drink coffee, spicy foods, etc. with no flare ups. Every year, the symptoms have been starting earlier in the year; 2021 -> December, 2024 -> October.

I've tried a few remedies, none of which have worked. I am desperate to say the least. I am looking into ARA-290 as a remedy for this winter and was hoping someone else out here has tried it. I have used peptides (BPC, TB, GHK) several times over the past year and a half, all for soft-tissue injuries/surgery healing with great success. I even ran a cycle last winter for a hamstring tear, hoping to get secondary relief for EM, but no luck.

While there is no direct evidence of ARA-290 treating EM, there is some indirect evidence in that the peptide is used to treat small fiber neuropathy, is an anti-inflammatory, promote neurogensis, and can enhance vascular health.

1n94fav,https://www.reddit.com/r/INTPrelationshipLab/comments/1n94fav/i_love_my_family_but_i_dont_like_being_alone_with/,"I love my family, but I don’t like being alone with them.","This may be a confusing title, so let me explain. My family is super loving, especially on my mom’s side. I love them too…but I’m very avoidant with them. I’m avoidant in general, but even more with my family than with friends or even with strangers. But the big catch is that I hate spending time with them ALONE. As in when my mom, stepdad, grandmother, etc. invites me over for a meal or a holiday or whatever. When it’s JUST ME.

Now what I’ve noticed is that if I’m in a relationship and they invite my girlfriend to join me, or even if I’m single and they invite a friend to come with me, it’s all good. Nothing awkward or uncomfortable when that happens.

I think there may be two reasons. Firstly, when someone accompanies me to visit family, they don’t get into my private business. They aren’t going to ask me if I’ve had a seizure, when and where I’m traveling, how much money I’m making, etc. if my friend or girlfriend is there with me. And they’re also a bit distracted by the person with me, trying to keep him or her entertained. Not all of the focus is on me, which is relieving.

Secondly, I don’t feel pressured to stick around forever. If my family has me over for dinner on a Saturday night after work, and then dinner is over, I feel pressured (perhaps I’m putting the pressure on myself, or they’re doing it, or a combination of both…I’m not sure) to stick around until they kick me out. And I feel like I need to make up some story about how I have to go to the store, or I need to take a shit and want to use my bidet at home, or something else equally stupid, to get out of there once I’m sick of them. Otherwise, they’d probably just as soon have me stay the night. After all, my mom and stepdad do have a three bedroom house, despite the two of them being the only ones living there.

It’s just always awkward…unless someone is with me. If someone is with me, I don’t have to make up some white lie. They’ll do it for me.

“Oh, PockASqueeno and I were planning on going to a movie tonight—we have to go.” If we’re dating, that may actually be true.

Sometimes I try the “Irish goodbye” method, but that rarely works. They know me too well. All eyes are on me, and if I start to creep towards the door, they’ll see me and be like “You’re going already?! Where’s my hug?!” Once in a blue moon I can creep out, but this is so rare.

So I guess the problem is partially mine (for being overly avoidant) and partially theirs (for being overly hospitable, if there is such a thing).

Does anyone else have this problem? Do you ever wish your family actually cared LESS about them? Sometimes my mom will be like “Come over and I’ll feed you!”, and on one hand, it’s hard to turn down her delicious cooking, but on the other hand, I just know it’s going to be awkward.

Let me know if you can relate, and if so, how you deal with it. People tell me I should spend as much time as I can with my parents and grandmother because they won’t be around much longer…and then they make me feel bad because I know it’s true. I just don’t like being stuck interacting with them. We don’t even really like the same things. I like jazz music, Indian food, psychology, and theology…while they’d rather talk to me about my everyday life. I don’t like that shit. I don’t like talking about what I do. They’re very action oriented. They want to know what I actually DID recently. Did I go on vacation? Did I get promoted at work? But most of them are ISTJs. That’s boring to me…and feels like an invasion of privacy. I don’t like talking about myself in general…but I’d rather talk about the newest jazz album out or the history of coffee. Not what I did last week.

Or better yet, not talk at all, and just go home to watch YouTube.

Despite having both parents, due to their nature, the love I get is never really parental. Mostly fear from my father and lack of love from my mother(long story short).

Apparently around the economic recession around when I was around 4 or 5, I was being taken care of by my babysitter. She is a good person, don't worry(still a bit fierce but not as bad as my dad last time). But what i never realised is that I have accidentally taken the caretaker role since there are smaller kids there.

Just after that when I was nine, since there are problems, I was sent to a daycare with others my age with, two catches: 

i) First I have a language barrier so I cannot communicate as well to anyone there AT ALL.

ii)I was being bullied by others due to my small size and language barrier.

That happened for 2 years, and I left the daycare for a better one, which I still get bullied in school, still for one more year.

Somehow didn't even get bad grades after that since I was somehow able to enter high school after that, but with the main teacher being verbally abusive, I started getting flashbacks and the only reason I got there is by coffee, tiredness, depression, and people pushing me physically to do it.(also for 2 years)

at the third year, luckily the teacher switched, and I get to talk to another teacher which is nice, and she realised I am in total pain. Once I realise even when people want to help me, they can't, I switched to a school who actually speak English for once.

so I switched to another school and have to deal with PTSD and depression for a long time. And I struggle with both academics and mental health for too long.

Now I'm in uni, and I'm trying to find a girl that gave me whatever i lack of my entire 2/3rds of my life. Maybe then I can stop and take a rest

I have NOT been strict with the diet for several reasons - I have ibs and many things on the MD really give me a lot of digestive problems (onions, beans, vegetables like zucchini, eggplant, cabbage, among other things). Also, my life is quite hectic right now  and I'm a high stress person to begin with and trying to plan meals for myself, plus for everyone else who won't eat this way (well, husband will, but he has kidney stones and has been told to absolutely not eat things like spinach, beets, certain types of beans, almonds....it's a long list).

I've also recently quit caffeine, I was drinking 4-5 cups of black coffee per day and I quit in hopes of reducing my anxiety/stress level (and dependence on caffeine). In the 3 weeks since I quit caffeine, I've gained back almost all of the 5 pounds I lost in the last 3 months and I am still really missing that coffee.

  
Well, it seems the ""gentle"" approach of just being conscious to increase whole grains and decrease meat has not helped. I just had bloodwork, and it's exactly the same as it was 2 years ago - LDL is 125, HDL is 58.

I see the cardiologist Monday, and I fear he will want to put me on statins. My guess is that he's going to give me 3 months to get my LDL down or else....

  
So, I guess my question is - will going super-strict on this diet actually change anything if going ""relaxed"" with it did nothing? We went from eating meat every single day, with beef and/or pork usually twice a week and fish only occasionally, white bread (well, I often make sourdough bread, but I used white flour), regular pasta, white rice, etc. - to eating vegetarian at least once a week, sometimes twice, beef/pork no more than once a week, fish once a week, and chicken the other days....only buying sliced bread with the ""whole grain"" stamp on it, switching everything to whole wheat/WG - wraps, pita bread, pasta. I order semi-pearled farro on Amazon because they only have pearled in stores. We stopped eating sandwiches and leftovers for lunch and started eating salad. None of this changed my cholesterol. My mental plate is already full, and I fear that going strict is going to push me over the edge - could stress level, family history, and menopause be the true factor here?

**Genre:** Erotic Romance / Coming-of-Age (explicit, character-driven, slow-burn, age-gap)

**Word Count:** \~50K (novella length, complete draft).  I plan to expand this to a full novel, two to three times longer, but want feedback on the story, as is, first.

**Synopsis:**  
Brittney Carnell, a psychology major at UTC, has always chosen her “firsts” deliberately. While her roommates collect stories of hookups and missteps, she waits — not out of fear, but conviction. Over late-night study sessions, Friday dance floors, and countless coffees, she finds herself drawn to Brad Dorset, a widower twice her age whose steady presence and patience embody the respect she’s been waiting for. *Carnell Knowledge* follows Brittney’s journey from self-assured young womanhood into intimacy deliberately chosen — a first time that isn’t about innocence lost, but sovereignty gained.

**Content Warnings:**  
This novella is explicit. It contains graphic sex, nudity, frank discussions of sexuality, erotic discovery, age-gap romance, adult humor, and emotionally intense relationship dynamics. If explicit sexual content or May–December romance isn’t your thing, this won’t be a fit.

**Excerpts:**  
The *Prelude* is linked below as a teaser. It introduces Brittney, Brad, and her friend group (“the Posse”), setting the stage for the mix of friendship, self-discovery, and intimacy that unfolds. 

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Due\_Affect\_15/comments/1n946hp/carnell\_knowledge\_prelude/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Due_Affect_15/comments/1n946hp/carnell_knowledge_prelude/)

**Preferred Timeline:**  
No rush — I'll send you the full PDF which is 50k words on 125 8.5x11 pages. A 1–2 week turnaround would be amazing, but I’m flexible and deeply grateful for any time you’re willing to give.

**Open for Critique Swap?**  
Yes. I can trade beta reading (romance, erotica, literary fiction) or brainstorm feedback.

**Desired Feedback:**  
I don’t need line edits but will take them. What I’d love is a reader’s perspective:

* Do the characters feel real, likable, or frustrating?
* Does the slow-burn dynamic work? Does the eventual intimacy feel earned?

Mahal ba talaga niya yung girl?,"May classmate ako before sa Gen Morals and Contemporary World. Hindi ko siya gaanong napapansin noon nung magkaklase pa kami last January. Fast forward to last month, August 16, 2025, nag-add siya sa akin sa FB. In-accept ko naman since alam kong classmate ko siya dati. That time malamig yung weather so nag-post ako ng note na “cuddle weather.” That night, nag-reply siya ng “coffee weather.”

Nag-aya siya magkape. Medyo na-delay yung meet up namin kasi nakatulog daw siya, pero natuloy rin kami madaling araw. Okay naman yung vibe namin—nakapag-open up siya about sa past niya. Kwento niya ginawa raw siyang “kabit” dati, pero tiniis niya kasi gusto niya yung girl. Ang gaan lang ng usapan namin, and that same day may nangyari sa amin 🥹. Naulit pa kinabukasan nung nagkita kami ulit.

After two days, sinabi ko sa kanya na ayaw ko ng FUBU or FWB setup kasi hindi ko gusto yung ganun. So nag-usap kami about trying something na mas may meaning. Bago siya umalis, nag-forehead kiss pa siya. Sa mga sumunod na araw, super okay ng vibe namin—masaya, chill, parang sobrang gaan lang.

Pero dumating yung August 23. Madaling araw sinundo niya ako galing inuman. Tumakas lang rin siya ng inuman birthday yun ng bff niya. May pupuntahan din kasi siyang birthday nung araw na yun kaya dun na siya matutulog saakin. That night, nagkwento ulit siya tungkol sa ex niya—yung girl na ginawa siyang kabit. May incident daw before na hindi niya makalimutan.

Tinanong ko siya, “Kung babalik yung girl, babalikan mo ba?” Hindi siya nakasagot. Medyo nasaktan ako, pero binalewala ko. That same time, nag-open up ako sa kanya about pagsisinungaling—sinabi ko ayaw kong nagsisinungaling siya kasi alam niya kung anong pinagdaanan ko before. Sabi niya gusto niya ako, tapos niyakap niya ako.

Kinahapunan ng August 23, wala siyang kahit anong update. Nag-stalk ako sa IG niya at nalaman kong nag-hide siya ng story from me. Ginamit ko dump account ko para tingnan, at dun ko nalaman na yung birthday na pinuntahan niya ay debut pala nung past girl niya. Confrontation happened the same day—umiyak ako sa call, nag-sorry siya.

August 24, nag-sorry ulit siya and sinabi niyang narealize niya yung katangahan niya. Sabi niya “aayusin niya yung sarili niya.” Inask ko siya kung willing pa ba niyang itry yung saamin. Ang sagot niya:

“Hindi ko pa alam isasagot ko jan kasi hindi pa ako fully healed e. Kahit sabihin kong nagmomove forward na ako sa past ko, syempre may natitira pa rin e. At yun naman yung gusto mo diba? Bago pumasok sa relationship, dapat okay na yung isang tao. Wala nang sabit about sa past.”

Tinanong ko rin siya kung mag-uusap pa ba kami. Sabi niya, “Personal? Okay lang naman sakin. Ayaw mo ba ako maging kaibigan? 😔”

Sinagot ko, “Paanong friends ba? Yung tipong nagkikita lang accidentally or friends na same pa rin yung set up?”
Sabi niya, “Ang pangit naman kapag ganun lang tapos magkaibigan lang 🥹. Nagkaroon naman talaga ako ng feelings sayo nung lagi tayong magkasama 😭. Ayaw mo lang kasi ako paniwalaan, galit ka.”

So parang clear na we could still hang out as friends.

Fast forward August 25, lumabas kami para kumain kasi wala daw siyang kasama. Nag-usap kami ulit, nag-explain ako ng lahat at binigay ko lahat ng advice na kaya ko. Umuwi siya agad after, then after 1 hour nag-chat siya saying sorry kasi ayaw daw niya makita ko siyang emotional. Same day, dun siya natulog sa akin.

August 26, sabay pa kami pumasok sa school ng 8 AM. Pero sa mga sumunod na araw, bihira na kami mag-usap. August 28, nag-chat siya if pwede ulit siya makitambay sa apartment. Lunch time yun, nag-cuddle and kiss pa kami. Then sabay ulit pumasok sa school.

Kinabukasan, nag text siya saakin if ano daw room ko? Kasi naaamoy niya perfume ko. Nagkaroon pa kami konti ng convo nun then Same day nun may tinanong ako sa kanya sa chat kasi parang may kutob ako. Sabi ko, “May hindi ka ba sinasabi sa akin?” Napansin kong parang nagpa-panic siya. Ang dami niyang sinabi na “nakita ko ba daw yung car, kumain lang daw sila” then nagsend ng pic and vid. Tapos bigla niyang binanggit: “Or yung about sa ex? Oo, nakakausap ko siya.”

Parang tumigil utak ko nung time na yun. Like, wdym nakakausap mo siya tapos ganito tayo? In-add ko yung girl sa FB at finorward ng girl sakanya na inadd ko siya, hindi ko ma-message yung girl kasi naka-restrict settings nung girl.

Natakot siya that time. Sabi niya, “Ba’t daw nadadamay ex niya.” Sabi pa niya, “Siyempre di mawala yung pagmamahal ko sa kanya kaya sinusubukan ko pa ring ayusin.”

Ang nasabi ko lang: “Okay.”

Nag-call siya after, pero ang pinaka tumatak lang sa akin yung sinabi niyang, “Tangina, ano ba tayo?”
Sinagot ko siya, “Wala ba akong karapatan?”

Ang sakit kasi after niyang sabihin na gusto niya ako, forehead kiss pa and all, tapos biglang ganun. Like wdym?inaayos niyo yung sainyo? Tapos sasabihin mo ring naaamoy mo yung pabango ko? Tapos dun ka natutulog saakin? Nag cucuddle pa tayo? Yung mga oras na yun nafefeel mo ba kung ano mararamdaman ng inaayos mong connection? 

After that, wala na kaming naging maayos na usapan.

Now, iniistory niya yung girl sa IG pero naka-hide sa akin. Nag lie ulit siya sinabi niyang nasa manila na si girl. Yun pala nagkita sila. Ano yun? Ayaw niya akong masaktan? Or ayaw niya lang mawala ako sa buhay niya kasi yung girl mag-aaral sa Manila at ako yung nandito malapit sa kanya? At mahal ba talaga niya yung girl kung tinatago niya sa akin? Ano ba dapat kong gawin? Should I still talk to him one last time?",1,1757076251.0,TanongLang,1,1.0,False

It's almost like she gave in to him romantically just for any degree of love from him, even if it isn't what she wanted but she had lost Conrad and Susannah.


Then she turns on Conrad to appease Jeremiah.


All her interactions with Conrad in contrast, he is patient and kind, even through season one when he was going through a lot alone.

- The map combines 20 years of satellite observations of near‑infrared reflectance and solar‑induced chlorophyll fluorescence, modeled at a 30‑meter pixel scale.
- It distinguishes locations with a single growth peak from those with two peaks linked to bimodal rainfall, exposing “hotspots” where timing changes sharply – notably Mediterranean climates, tropical mountain ranges, the U.S. Southwest, the Andes, East African highlands, European alpine valleys and parts of Southeast Asia.
- Adjacent sites only a few kilometers apart can differ by weeks in flowering or harvest dates; Colombian coffee growers already experience two separate harvest windows because of these micro‑climatic shifts.
- The authors warn that such rapid phenological breaks can reduce gene flow, create local adaptation, and increase the risk of mismatches between plants, pollinators and migratory species, especially as climate change alters temperature and precipitation patterns.
- The full dataset is publicly available for integration with climate models, conservation planning and agricultural decision‑making.

Why it matters: The map provides a baseline for detecting climate‑driven timing anomalies that could threaten food security and biodiversity.

I [M27] matched with this woman [F34] on Tinder over a month ago. 
After a bit of scheduling conflicts and me having to cancel the first date due to getting sick we finally managed to setup another first date. 

During the date we spent 5 hours in her city just walking around a park, sitting in the sun talking and ended up at a café later on for a snack and coffee. From the beginning to the end of the date she was quite touchy and super talkative and seemed to really enjoy our date even telling me that it feels like she's known me for a long time already, despite us basically being strangers. At the end she came with me to the train station, we hugged goodbye and told each other that we'll reach out again.

When I got home I texted her how I enjoyed her company and would love to meet her again. She replied that she would definitely love to see me again as well and so we setup another date, which was five days away. The following two days we mostly talked a bit about how our day went and how we're looking forward to seeing each other again. I noticed she was very stressed with her job as she would mostly reach out to me to tell me how stressful her day has been so far hoping that mine went better. Then on the 3rd day I first got a one word reply followed by not getting one at all in the evening which was odd. Usually she replied within the 1-2 hour mark with quite some effort. My gut feeling was already telling me something was wrong and of course it was.

The next morning she tells me how she can't make it to our date and that she's sorry, completely ignoring my last message. I ask if she's wants to reschedule and if she's still interested. She replies that she is open to rescheduling, so I send her three dates where I would be available. (She lives 90 minutes away from me in a big city that has WAY more to offer than mine, so I've agreed to come visit her most of the time.) We agree on next thursday, same time and same place. 

Now here's the thing, I then messaged her that I'm looking forward to seeing her again and made a witty joke about how we're even when it comes to cancelling dates now.
She read the message after 25 hours and hasn't replied yet. It feels like all the excitement she had about meeting me has vanished over night. I honestly think she shifted her attention to someone else.

Now I'm wondering: should I reach out to her again or just wait if something comes from her side? I don't have much hope in that date happening next week if I'm being honest and I don't want to come across as too needy.",1,1757075762.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

At 17 my granddad passed, and I numbed out—weed, then cocaine. At 24 a car wreck put me on pain pills, and for the next ten years pills and meth ran my life. I sold meth, and one bad decision led to another: a friend took a U-Haul and stole copper from Georgia Power; police came looking for him, searched my place, and found pistols, drugs, money, paraphernalia, and stolen items. Twenty-seven months ago I landed in Harris County Jail.

I had no relationship with God—just drugs, money, and parties. In jail, looking at 15 years, a guy in my dorm started a Bible study. When you’ve got nothing left, you finally look up. I started reading the Word and messaging on the kiosk about rehab. An application showed up—for A Better Way. Billy Johnson interviewed me and made it sound like the hardest thing I’d ever do. He was right about the “hard”—and still, it turned out to be the best thing I’ve ever completed.

Walking onto the property was surreal—white houses, clean streets, and a hundred men who’d call you brother. At first A Better Way was just a vehicle to avoid prison. I left… then God shut every door and sent me back. On the way out I met a man on a stolen bike, no sleep for days, no power at “home,” stealing Fix-a-Flat. God whispered, “This is you if you keep going.” I still tried to run to Columbus—He blocked it. The moving crew brought me back; I took my consequences and got to work.

The small rules became my training: make the bed right, keep the room tight, wash and fold, stay clean, be on time. Those little obediences made big choices easier. God surrounded me with mentors and brothers—Anthony Dove, Alfred Jones, and more—men who told me truth, taught me to place my anger, and stayed when it got rough.

Florida sealed the change. Twelve of us—my intake and Restore Your Heart brothers—drove to Santa Rosa Beach. Morning devotions with Brother John on the sand, coffee in hand, football in the afternoon, hunting sand dollars like kids. When I went under the water, I left baggage there. People said I looked like a brand-new man coming up. A prophetic word the week before said God saw me and was publicly announcing His faithfulness to me. Since then I’ve tried to reflect what He’s done, not demand what I thought He owed.

Today my relationship with God isn’t a theory—it’s daily. He used to feel like an absent father; now He’s present in everything. I read the Word, share my faith, and watch eyes light up. The Brotherhood here is unlike anything I’ve found—men who stand beside you, not away from you. Brother Doug is like a second father, and Adam is a close friend I can call any time. My family has seen a complete change—if you knew me two years ago, you wouldn’t recognize me now.

This was harder than prison—hands down—because 90% of the fight was with the old me. But the fight is worth it.

What I’m taking with me  
• Little obediences, big freedom—order the small things and the big things follow.  
• Brotherhood over isolation—tell the truth, ask for help, stay connected.  
• Daily Word before daily world—let Scripture set my responses.  
• Remember the water—what I buried in baptism stays buried.  
• Keep finishing—when it gets hard, don’t run; lean in and let God build the new man.

God gave me back more than time—He gave me brothers, purpose, and His presence. I don’t know where I’d be without Him. Here, I found a better way—and I’m not going back.",2,1757075367.0,TheTestimonyOfJesus,2,1.0,False

The set is curated to showcase top-tier specialty coffees with a mix of rare, high-end beans and consistently exceptional classics like a tasty Catuai from Costa Rica.  The one consistant thread through it all is each roaster has been asked to send us their two best coffees, the ones they’re most proud to present to the world.

He was having a tonic-clonic seizure. His first ever that we’re aware of. We’ve been together seven years and I’ve never noticed anything. 

I called 911 because I thought it was a stroke. Thankfully I took a video. They did a CT in the hospital and blood work all of which came back clear we aren’t able to get in with a neurologist to the end of the month so we contacted our primary care doctor and he referred us for an MRI for next week.

I really just wanna cover all my bases here he’s 42 years old.

There are some things that may come into play after the seizure. We started evaluating some of his lifestyle choices and we realized he was having over 1000 mg of caffeine per day. He’s also been stressed at work and not sleeping as much as he should.

Based on what I’m reading some of those things could cause problems. He’s now on a strict one coffee per day drink and the rest water. No more soda or energy drinks. And he’s going to bed between 9-10pm.



TL:DR Would a EEG be beneficial a month after the first event should I contact his primary care doctor back and try to get one done now?

1n93u9v,https://v.redd.it/u4gsgbp6acnf1,"A Better Way Ministries — From Stealing, Numbing, and Family Fracture to Brotherhood, First Baptism, and Learning to Lead (Gerald’s Testimony)","I grew up on ball—basketball first, then football with my cousins. Home was the Sunset neighborhood, a full house: me, my sister, cousins, auntie, and for a while my mom and dad together. My mom raised us right. The problem wasn’t her—it was me not understanding a lot of things and not knowing how to handle what I felt. Me and my sister didn’t get along for a long time. Me and my dad were more alike than I wanted to admit, but when I tried to share my side, it felt like I wasn’t heard.

I started stealing at 14. By high school I was smoking and drinking to keep from feeling anything. When pills got involved, I didn’t care who you were—family or stranger—if I wanted to take from you, I did. I crossed a line when I stole from my sister. After that, I was at my dad’s house with no car, no home, and a head full of smoke and rocks. I told myself the only way I’d ever stop was if I died.

The first time I came to A Better Way, it was to quiet everybody—my mom, stepdad, wife, the whole family. I walked into chapel and the music was going, hands were up, people told me they loved me…and it made me sick. I thought everybody in there was high. I didn’t trust it. But the Brotherhood here turned out to be the realest thing I’ve ever seen. You can be close with blood, but what I found with these brothers—men who tell you the truth, pray with you, and stay when you’re ugly—that bond is stronger than anything I’ve known.

Florida changed me. We laughed, did morning devotion, and loaded our coffee with sugar and whipped cream. It was my first baptism ever. God knew it would be Brother John who put me under. This time I understood what I was doing. I left the old me in that water and came up new.

What I’ve learned here is how to be a man—how to put myself aside to lead a family, keep a home, and choose the right thing when nobody’s watching. Change didn’t happen overnight. It took about six months before some things finally broke off. But they did. The anger, the numbness, the “I don’t care”—they’ve been replaced with peace and responsibility.

What I’m taking with me  
• Brotherhood over isolation—let men speak into my life and keep me accountable.  
• Daily devotion—start my day in the Word so my feelings don’t run my decisions.  
• Leadership at home—love first, set standards, and be consistent.  
• Honesty and ownership—tell on myself early, make it right quickly.  
• Slow, steady change—trust God’s process even when it takes time.

I’m thankful for this place, for the brothers, and even for the hard days that exposed what needed to go. I’m not who I was. By God’s grace, I’m learning to lead, to love, and to live new.",2,1757075099.0,TheTestimonyOfJesus,2,1.0,False

My cousin wrote a book about our family and the whole thing is a bunch of lies.,"My cousin was a real piece of shit, his whole life he stole money from my grandparents and then blackmailed my mom and my aunt. He used to take a lot of pride and thinking how good at being manipulative he was, but realistically, he was just taking advantage of two old people who loved him. And now he’s writing a book about how he’s a victim of his family and how he’s trying to find redemption. 

This is completely untrue. There’s even a scene in the book that happened in real life where we met up for coffee and he put a lot of really specific details in there about me and my other cousins.  Basically he wrote it as if we wouldn’t forgive him and that I specifically had a lot of distain for him. But it’s the opposite of the truth. We all told him he didn’t do anything to us. There’s no reason for him to apologize to us. He should ask forgiveness of our moms. And then he denied ever stealing money ever taking advantage of people ever blackmailing so we were kinda like - ok then where is this conversation going?  And then left.

I know that it’s not a memoir. It’s just a book but wow, reading his redemption fantasy where everybody just thinks he needs a chance and it is actually a good person is really in mind blowing. That’s all it is. It’s the fantasy of how he wants everybody to see him and making everybody else worse to make himself look better.

I don’t know if I have a right to be angry like this because technically it is his work he can write whatever he wants. But I am considering doing a whole Instagram TikTok about every lie in the book.",2,1757074899.0,AIO,4,0.75,False
1n93rbt,https://v.redd.it/xer3slmg9cnf1,"A Better Way Ministries — From High-Speed Chaos and Fifteen Arrests to Brotherhood, Devotion, and Leaving It in the Water (Patrick’s Testimony)","I was born and raised in Georgia in a strong, military family. Football was my world—high school, then college—and I had the “All-American kid” track: good student, big dreams, clear path. I started a serious relationship, prayed for a child, and God gave me a son. I learned to drive trucks to provide, picturing a simple life: work hard, love my family, build a home.

Then the road got long, the nights got longer, and “staying up” turned into drugs and alcohol. Cocaine, meth, liquor—what started as help to make the miles turned into chains I couldn’t break. I didn’t start using as a teenager like most stories you hear; my downhill slide hit in my thirties. I lost my family—she did the right thing and left. After that, it was a blur: homelessness, hotels, surviving the streets, and more trouble than I could count. I was arrested fifteen or sixteen times for drug- and alcohol-related charges. I told myself I was in control, but the truth is I couldn’t stop.

The spiral got violent. One day I was high on just about everything, got into a high-speed chase, and fought the police. I violated probation and landed back in county. Even inside, I couldn’t stay out of trouble; a fight moved me to a different dorm. That’s where God cornered me with grace. A guy in the new dorm—who had stolen a van from A Better Way—put their book in my hands. He said, “If you can get in there, you might not have to go to prison.” I started reading. What caught me wasn’t polished talk; it was that the founder had walked where I had walked. I didn’t want a brochure; I wanted someone who knew the trenches. When the time came to choose a program, I chose A Better Way.

I won’t lie: I didn’t come to find Jesus. I came to avoid prison. But Jesus found me anyway.

The transport van stopped inside the gates of a state prison on the way—close enough for me to feel the edge of God’s wrath and the weight of His mercy. We sat there a while, then pulled back out. It felt like the Lord was saying, “You’re this close—but I’m giving you another chance.” They dropped me off at Grace House. After so much jail, stepping into that house felt surreal. I wasn’t locked up, but I wasn’t free yet either. Eighteen months sounded impossible, but I was mandated, and deep down I knew I needed it.

Structure hit immediately: early mornings, quiet hours, shirts tucked, beds tight, buttons and zippers checked, consequences when I ignored directions. Where I came from, “correction” meant you square up. Here, it meant “course-correction”—firm, consistent, and aimed at my heart. I learned that the easy thing is to lash out, defend yourself, and push back. The hard thing is to be patient, to listen, to obey, to love the person who’s rubbing you wrong. At first, I’d have preferred to be body-slammed than corrected gently, because the gentle kind gets under your pride and changes you.

God used brothers to do that changing. I found a core group of men who wouldn’t let me drift. They saw through my tough exterior and stayed anyway. “Iron sharpens iron” isn’t pretty—it throws sparks—but it makes a real edge. We prayed, we talked, we messed up, we made it right. I started to see God in the way they walked, and I wanted that walk.

Devotion became the engine of my day. Proverbs pulled me in first—clear, simple, sharp—and that opened the door to the rest of the Word. I don’t treat devotion like a buffet; I just make sure I eat. Most mornings, God gives me a bite that carries me. I learned to ask, “What are You saying to me today?” and to let that word steer my reactions before my old reflexes take over.

Florida sealed it. We went down with most of my intake brothers. Mornings were coffee and devotion with Brother John, who gave me time, wisdom, and straight answers. Then came baptism. I had been baptized as a kid, but this time I knew exactly what I was doing and Who I was giving my life to. Standing in the Gulf as a grown man, I settled it: I’m done with the old life. When I went under, I left rage, jealousy, rebellion—everything that kept me running—in that water. When I came up, I knew I belonged to Jesus.

Since then, the biggest change is inside. I don’t carry the same hate and animosity. The “bump this, screw that” attitude—that quick spark to fight—has been replaced with peace I can’t fake. Boundaries don’t hem me in; they hold me up. Correction doesn’t shame me; it saves me. Mercy and grace used to be words I heard in church. Now they’re the air I breathe. I see the Father’s love in ways I missed before—through brothers who tell me the truth, leaders who set guardrails, and a God who kept me from a cell I earned and gave me a life I don’t deserve.

What I’m taking with me is simple and strong:  
• Daily devotion first—let God set my tone before the world does.  
• Choose the harder thing—love, patience, obedience—when anger offers the shortcut.  
• Stay in brotherhood—no isolation, real accountability, tell the truth in love.  
• Receive correction quickly—course-correct before a small drift becomes a wreck.  
• Remember the Gulf—what I left in that water stays buried.

I came to A Better Way to escape prison. I found a Father who chased me down, brothers who stood me up, and a Savior who washed me clean. I’m grateful—more than anything—for time to sit still, hear God, and learn that I’m loved beyond measure. I’m not who I was.

If you’re serious about Bahrain company formation, knowing how to secure your brand legally isn’t optional—it’s your first line of defense and your passport to the GCC market.\

Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025: Why Protecting Your Brand Matters\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting., Bahrain’s non-oil sector is projected to grow by 3.4% in 2025, driven by tech, logistics, and, notably, Intellectual Property filings. Forbes Business recently rated Bahrain the second most improved MENA jurisdiction for IP protection this year, citing streamlined digital procedures and new cooperation protocols with WIPO.\
\
“Trademark registrations rose 19% in Bahrain during Q1 2025, reflecting both a startup surge and increased foreign investment,” notes Gulf News Bahrain.\
\
The country’s strategic position—bridging Saudi Arabia and the UAE—combined with liberal company formation policies (see KeyLink’s full Bahrain company formation guide), means that international and local founders alike are clamoring for market share. The result? More copycats, more brand confusion, and a real risk to your business identity unless you act quickly.\
Surprisingly, one of Bahrain’s low-key advantages over UAE or Saudi Arabia is the speed and transparency of its Sijilat system. While Dubai excels in glitz and Riyadh leans on scale, Bahrain’s MOICT has quietly built a business-friendly registration infrastructure that makes trademark protection accessible, even for solo entrepreneurs.\

Understanding the Trademark Landscape: Recent 2025 Regulatory Updates\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. aligning Bahrain’s IP framework with updated WIPO standards. The most important changes?\
\
Faster review timelines: Official examination time reduced from 120 to 60 working days. (Previously, this wait drove everyone, myself included, slightly mad.)\
Online priority claims: Foreign applicants can now submit international priority claims directly through Sijilat, reducing travel and courier costs by about 40%.\
Broader class coverage: The changes mean more flexible multi-class applications—crucial for modern digital businesses.\
\
And here’s a personal aside: when the new Sijilat interface went live, I spent two hours just navigating the new document upload protocols. Lesson learned—MOICT quietly switched the requirement order for power of attorney and legalized commercial registration, so double-check the upload sequence before submitting.\

Step-by-Step Guide: Registering Your Trademark in Bahrain\
1. Check Your Name and Logo—Twice\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation., but you can also run a free check at the MOICT self-service kiosks (early mornings are best to avoid queues).\
\
Visit Bahrain’s Trademark Search Portal or ask an agent.\
Double-check for similar or “confusingly alike” marks in English and Arabic—Bahrain examiners are strict on phonetic similarities.\
\
2. Gather Required Documents (The Smart Way)\
\
Commercial Registration (CR) certificate—get a digital copy via Sijilat, stamped electronically.\
High-resolution logo file in JPG or PDF.\
POA for your agent, notarized and legalized if foreign.\
Priority claim evidence, if relevant.\
\
Document Shortcut: If you’re rushing and already in the Diplomatic Area, use the Tamkeen Digital Hub’s on-site scanning/attestation kiosks. Saved me from a frantic taxi ride more than once.\
3. Submit Your Application Via Sijilat\
\
Go to Sijilat Portal\
Select “Trademark Registration.”\
Fill in details, upload scans in the correct order (as above).\
Pay application fees online (currently 50 BHD per class).\
\
Time-Saver: Friday applications avoid peak hour digital traffic and post-Ramadan, the workflows are fastest mid-week (Tuesday/Wednesday).\
4. MOICT Examination and Publication\
\
The examiner will review for conflicts and content (expect some back-and-forth questions).\
If accepted, your mark will be published in the Official Gazette for 60 days.\
Third parties may object—rare, but it happens, especially in F&B or fintech. (One founder’s coffee chain logo got challenged by a Saudi conglomerate—two meetings and a majlis later, they settled amicably at Seef Mall over qahwa.)\
\
5. Final Registration and Certificate Collection\
\
No objections? You get a payment request for the final issuance fee (50 BHD per mark/class).\
Download the digital certificate directly from Sijilat or collect a hard copy at MOICT HQ, Seef District.\
\
Pro Tip: For urgent needs, arrange courier delivery—many agents offer it as part of their service.\
\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Bahrain Trademark Registration\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.)\
- Publication Fee: 50 BHD per mark/class\
- Agent Fees: 100–250 BHD (if using an IP consultant)\
- Legalization/Translation: 20–60 BHD (if documents are not in Arabic)\
- Total Typical Budget: 120–400 BHD (if DIY), 250–700 BHD (with full service agent)\
If you’re registering multiple classes, the costs add up. But most startups stick to one or two classes at first, expanding as needed. And unlike Dubai, there’s no “fast-track” super-premium service, so don’t get upsold by agents promising impossible timelines.\
Unexpected fee triggers: If your business is owned via a Bahrain free zone, check special rules for free zone entities here—the CR structure can impact trademark eligibility and fees.\
\
Choosing the Right Business Structure for Trademark Ownership\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. or SPC (Single Person Company): Most common choices—fast, simple, and fully eligible.\
- Foreign Branch: Can register, but tougher to prove distinct “Bahrain local” use.\
- Free Zone Entity**: Usually allowed, but get local IP counsel to confirm (see KeyLink’s business structure breakdown).\
Insider tip: If you’re pursuing 100% foreign ownership or 99% structures, make sure your CR lists the exact activities you want the trademark to cover—MOICT examiners are strict about activity-trademark alignment.\
Mistake to avoid: Many first-timers skip updating their CR business activities… only to have their trademark blocked for “activity mismatch.” Happened to me with a fintech client, and I had to revise our CR at the last minute. Prevention? Double-check your activity codes before applying, especially if you’ve recently amended your license.\
\
Compliance, Renewals, and Ongoing Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation..\
- Renewal Window: Start the process six months before expiry (renewal fee: 150 BHD per class).\
- Post-registration: Update your records with all business partners, especially with LMRA or Tamkeen for grants or employment quotas.\
For ongoing compliance or accounting support, see KeyLink’s accounting and bookkeeping services.\
And don’t forget: Bahrain’s business hours shift during Ramadan; always confirm your agent or MOICT’s availability before deadlines.\
\
Should You Use a Local Agent? My Recommendation\
\
Alt text: Professional business support. and KeyLink BH for their responsiveness and local connections. They’re not just paperwork pushers; a good agent will help you navigate unforeseen examiner queries, handle official Arabic correspondence, and even manage negotiations if objections pop up (and yes, sometimes these happen in a majlis with coffee service).\
But if you’re on a tight budget and own a simple WLL or SPC, you can usually handle the process yourself via Sijilat—just be ready for some administrative back-and-forth, particularly on translations and legalized documents.\
\
Common Bahrain Trademark Pitfalls—and How to Avoid Them\
Importantly, plenty of savvy entrepreneurs still make rookie errors:\
\
Submitting incomplete CR documents: Always include the latest digital, MOICT-stamped CR, not last year’s version.\
Missing the Arabic logo translation: All marks must have any non-Arabic elements transliterated and explained in the filing.\
Ignoring business activity alignment: As mentioned, unrelated marks get rejected—review your CR thoroughly.\
Overlooking post-registration steps: Update all government platforms (LMRA, Tamkeen, EDB), especially if applying for grants.\
\
Most preventative? Prepare your documents in advance, double-check every translation, and use Sijilat’s document preview function.\
\
Tangent: Bahrain’s Business Card Ritual—What It Taught Me About Brand Protection\
During my first week meeting clients in the Seef District, I noticed a curious custom: the double-sided business card, English on one side, Arabic on the other. It wasn’t just about courtesy—it was brand protection in action. Many old-school Bahrain professionals still judge a brand’s credibility by the accuracy of its Arabic name and logo.\
So when filing your trademark, don’t treat the Arabic version as an afterthought. Get a skilled native speaker to help with your official translation. This simple touch can win allies in government offices, smooth out examiner objections, and give your mark instant local legitimacy.\
It may seem like a small detail. But in my experience, it’s the detail that makes the difference.\
