After many late nights and coffee-fueled sessions, it’s finally done! 🌕✨ I’m so happy with how it turned out—the details and colors are stunning, especially the glowing lampposts and the dreamy night sky.

I got this kit from Amazon, and it was such a fun project! If anyone’s interested, here’s the link to the same one: \[[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/YarnMate-Diamond-Painting-Kits-Rhinestone/dp/B0CYBQ3JLQ?th=1)\] For only 3.xx, it’s an absolute steal!

I’d rate the kit a 8/10. Some of the drills were a bit mishapped, but overall it wasn’t too bad, and the final result still looks amazing!

To everyone working on their own diamond paintings, keep going! It’s so worth it when you see the finished piece sparkle. ✨🖤

What do you think? Should I change the frame to gold one before gifting it? 🤔

ABYG dahil cinut off ko na JHS friends ko? Pasensya na kung mahaba 'to, but it's worth it I promise.

Hello, for context I had a circle of friends back in Junior High School, originally 9 kami but one cut us off kasi nao-op na siya saamin (base sa chika nila saakin) at may nadagdagang dalawa unexpectedly kasi nag click kaya 10 na kami. I'm in college now, in my 3rd year already.

We were a decent group, inuman then, birthday celebrations kada year.

Yung nag cut off sa'min, I've been really sweet and kind to her until she left. We pass by each other sa university since same course pala kami! And we get to say hi, nagkakamustahan kami. Comfortable siya that way because we both know I never did her dirty. Kesyo kahit ako yung CCTV sa tropahan, I still make sure walang feeling outcast sa group. That sums up of what kind of person I am.

Our friendship started in a weird way... ano ibig kong sabihin? Bago ko sila maging tropa, they bullied me during Grade 8. Framed me na kesyo ninakaw ko raw yung 1K ng kaklase ko, na ako kumuha ng wallet nung isa, at ako nagtago ng phone naman ng isa pa. Nangyari lahat ng yan in 1 and a half years.

Reason nila for doing it? Kasi mukha raw akong inosente at madaling targetin during that time. Yes, nireport ko sila (thankful sa teacher ko that had my back) then after, I received an apology and became friends with them hangga't sa naging 2nd year college na kami.

Mind you, I've been really nice sa kanila since Grade 7. Kahit ginago nila ako at first, kindness comes first. People pleaser talaga ako malala dati.

Meron nga ako naging BFF talaga among the circle kasi parehas kami ng interests, aesthetics, etc. talagang parang platonic soulmates kami. We even went to The 1975 concert nung 2019 together, at ako ang bumili ng ticket niya (ganun ka-genuine pagmamahal ko sa friend na yun).

Until yung isang bago sa group na yun, kada araw napapansin ko yung bago at yung super BFF ko ang mas close na. Para silang kami, pero iba na kasama niya. So parang paunti-unti na ako nawawalan ng place from that pangyayari.

(1) First incident that started my sama ng loob is when my male ka-tropa invited us to come over his place to hang out, so yes kami. though, not complete so mga 6 lang kami nun. Kita kong mas masaya super BFF ko sa new bff niya, tumatawa sila, watching videos together. It pains me kasi ganun kami as well.

I appreciate when they called me to join, pero it doesn't sound genuine lalo na't isa o dalawang beses lang akong tinawag. Hindi ako pinipilit like before. I tried to join in, pero at the end parang napipilitan lang din ako at I caught them side eyeing me.

Inopen ko 'to sa ka-tropa ko, but she wouldn't understand and just proceeded to say na hayaan ko muna, baka raw kasi fresh friendship pa. I appreciate the optimistic approach, pero hindi yun kinailangan kong marinig e.

(2) Second incident (during 2nd year, 1st sem) that made me really upset was when I asked them out for coffee (minsan lang ako mag aya kasi introvert ako, so I guess mapapa-wow ka talaga) nag chat ako sa gc namin na ""hi guys, kape tayo. andito ako now sa [cafe near uni]."" nag seen lang sila at nag proceed sa bagong topic.

The funny thing pa is after the new topic, after a few minutes nag aya yung isa ng bilyaran. Some responded AGAD. Pero akong people pleaser non, sumama naman ako kahit masama loob ko haha. Also, hindi yun first time mangyari na walang gumustong sumama sa aya ko. Puro sa kanila lang nasusunod.

(3) Third, nag swimming kami. Alam nilang takot ako sa tubig kaya usually sa gilid lang ako. At the end, nobody bothered to help me or guide me na lumipat sa kabila na deeper part.

Habang lumilipat sila, nakakapit lang ako sa gilid, tapos hinihintay ko kahit isa man lang pumansin sa'kin, pero nasa dulo na sila, dedma pa rin. Nung nasa dulo na sila, they mockingly called my name and ngumiti nalang ako and sat sa stairs, watching them and playing with the water.

Again, it's not the first time they treated me like this.

Mostly, I've been the one treated as an outcast most of the time. Observant ako throughout our friendships, tahimik pero joker din once I feel like fitting in. Ako yung fashionista nilang friend kasi lumalapit sila for fashion advices, kesyo gusto nila aesthetic ko raw.

Siguro around 2nd year-2nd sem na nag develop frontal lobe ko and realized the overall disrespect I emdured throughout the years. Kaya around January 2024, naisipan kong i-cut off ko na sila. I prepared a long message to send sa pinagkakatiwalaan kong friend sa loob ng circle na yun kasi she knows how to understand.

ABYG kasi this is how I cut them off: I started by unfriending them one by one sa fb, removing the followings sa instagram, and softblocking them sa twitter before leaving the gc officially. Nung umalis na ako, dun ko minessage trusted ka-circle ko about it. The plot twist is, siya lang nangamusta after I left kaya ko nasend hahaha. Out of 10 people, siya lang nangamusta at tinanong bakit at anong nangyari bakit ako umalis, etc. She showed genuine
concern.

But after all that, wala na.


Until now, nagkakaroon ako ng friendship relapse about them. I miss them, but I really can't bear the disrespect I'd live with everyday.

Lalo na't nakikita ko kung paano mag story si super BFF ko at bago niyang BFF. Talagang parang kami dati and nakaka-bitter sobra kasi ang unfair. Sobrang unfair.

Another plot twist is that, mas close kami ni super BFF. Since Grade 7 kami, eh sila nung bago niyang bff, grade 10 lang naging close.",1,1732322786.0,AkoBaYungGago,0,1.0,False

Very new to making espresso at home (and also to this subreddit). I bought a starter machine (**Breville Barista Express**) as soon as I got back from a European vacation.

I've owned my machine for a little over a month and am still in the process of dialing it in. The main issue I'm running into is this:

* I make coffee for both myself or my wife
* I warm up the machine for about 5-10 minutes
* the first double espresso shot comes out pretty good. Still dialing it but overall getting there
* I clean out the portafiler and do everything the same. Same Weight and everything
* The second shot shows similar pressure (on the gauge) and everything, but the espresso drips and sometimes gives me less than a 1:1 ratio

Here's a video. Hoping someone could provide some help!

He said he hated himself and tended to chase the next happiness in his life.  He felt like a failure.  When I asked him how come and he said he couldn’t be somebody in his career and being a divorcee.  He was dating this girl for a few months and then they broken up around the end of this July.  He and I started seeing each other in the middle of this August.  I’ve learned that his ex-girlfriend wanted to get back with him but he rejected her.  He was even got mad at her in text for bugging him.  I appreciated that he shared that with me but didn’t understand why he didn’t just block her.  My partner left his email account logged in on my laptop a couple days ago.  I found an email exchange in the trash folder.  He didn’t ignore her or rejected her invite softly.  It is a little bit of open ending and seems to nice to her compared to his reply to her text he showed me in the past.  

I haven’t brought this email up with him yet.  I asked him what he meant about chasing the next happiness after I read the email.  He got pretty defensive about it.  I probably should’ve said anything:(.  

I am connecting the email and his mental state.  I feel that he is softened up and leaving her hoping she would have a chance in case he is seeking next shiny thing.

1gxmzuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1gxmzuh/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

I tried to post flyers, but it didn't grab that much attention. I figured this forum may be the best place to talk about a new book club I am hosting at 1418 Coffee in Downtown Plano on Sundays at 10 AM. The club is called Plot for Thought and focuses on great works both domestic and international. That being said, locations and hours are subject to change depending on future group votes but as of right now, that is the meeting time/place that I came up with.

Currently, I am in the middle of reading *The Master and Margarita* by Mikhail Bulgakov and have been hosting phantom meetings (showing up to 1418 just to stick to my word) and am about halfway through the book. I don't expect anyone to jump into a book club halfway through a book, but anyone who is familiar with the novel or would like to re-read it is more than welcome to join.

I know that the holidays are coming up and that schedules will be more limited, but I wanted to release this announcement earlier on to see if any interests could be piqued; that way I can make adequate preparations for the following year. For all of you American Literature nerds out there, the next (tentative) book that Plot for Thought will be discussing is *An American Tragedy* by Theodore Dreiser. I am super excited to get this thing off the ground and am happy to answer any questions ya'll have as it pertains to Plot for Thought.

Her look for the somber occasion included a Princess Kate-approved style staple: a coat dress.

# Duchess Sophie Wore an Olive Green Dress Coat

For the ceremony, Sophie opted for an olive green coat dress from Claire Mischevani with a bow detail along the high neckline, pockets along the midsection, and a full skirt, styled with taupe suede boots and eggplant-colored leather gloves. To complement the regal dress's mockneck, Sophie pulled her blonde hair into an updo that showed off her ornate gold [hoop earrings](https://www.instyle.com/best-hoop-earrings-6823138). She finished off the look with a natural glam that included a [rosy blush](https://www.instyle.com/viral-blush-trends-8687288), fringed lashes, and a mauve lip.Duchess Sophie Wore an Olive Green Dress CoatFor the ceremony, Sophie opted for an olive green coat dress from Claire Mischevani with a bow detail along the high neckline, pockets along the midsection, and a full skirt, styled with taupe suede boots and eggplant-colored leather gloves.

# Sophie's Dress Looked Familiar—Princess Kate Once Wore a Very Similar Style

If you thought the hunter crepe dress looked familiar, that's because Middleton wore an Alexander McQueen dress back in 2022 with a very similar silhouette and color. During [Christmas Day](https://www.instyle.com/kate-middleton-christmas-concert-special-surprise-8749451) service at Sandringham, Middleton wore a khaki utility-style frock with a high neck, flap pockets, and a pleated skirt.Sophie's Dress Looked Familiar—Princess Kate Once Wore a Very Similar StyleIf you thought the hunter crepe dress looked familiar, that's because Middleton wore an Alexander McQueen dress back in 2022 with a very similar silhouette and color.

Like Sophie, Middleton paired her look with suede boots and leather gloves, though [both were in a chocolate color way](https://www.instyle.com/chocolate-brown-outfits-8718984). She finished off the Christmas chic outfit with a matching wide-brim hat with a ribbon bow embellishment and a coordinating brown clutch.

# Sophie and Kate Love a Coat Dress

This isn't the first time the duchess has worn a coat dress, and it's certainly not Middleton's first rodeo, either. For Easter service in both 2023 and 2024, Sophie wore long dress coats in [jewel-tone colors](https://www.instyle.com/katie-holmes-weird-coffee-run-outfit-8750052). In 2023, she wore a magenta number with gray suede boots and a matching hat. In 2024, she styled her long royal purple coat with matching trousers and a white beret.Sophie and Kate Love a Coat DressThis isn't the first time the duchess has worn a coat dress, and it's certainly not Middleton's first rodeo, either.

Princess Kate has worn too many to name. The royal is a fan of Sarah Burton's designs at Alexander McQueen and Said Cyrus's work for Catherine Walker & Co. She's also been known to rewear many of her pieces and even [up-cycle old looks](https://www.instyle.com/kate-middleton-2024-trooping-the-colour-outfit-hidden-meaning-8665591).

Like Kate, Sophie is known for her chic and polished looks. Just earlier this week, the duchess visited the Fight for Sight Laboratory at University College in a black leather belted Loewe midi dress layered over a floral blouse and brown suede boots.

# Kate and Sophie Share a ""Sisterly Bond""

Both women married into the royal family—Sophie wed King Charles's younger brother Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, in 1999—which has [brought the two](https://www.instyle.com/princess-kate-duchess-sophie-sisterly-bond-8747442) together over the years. [*The Daily Mail*](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14067915/kate-middleton-sophie-royal-return-support-meghan-markle.html)’s Rebecca English said that Sophie acted as a [mentor to Kate](https://www.instyle.com/kate-middleton-tried-repeatedly-to-help-meghan-markle-transition-8747814) when she first joined the family, while royal biographer Ingrid Seward told [*Hello!*](https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/730367/sisterly-bond-duchess-sophie-princess-kate-revealed/)  that the women have bonded over the things they have in common.

""Sophie is like the older sister Kate never had,"" Seward said. “They are both protective of their children. Sophie has had a young family, so she knows what it’s like trying to protect them while being in the royal world.""

Seward added that they're ""incredibly kind girls"" and Sophie has been supportive of Middleton from the beginning. “\[Sophie\] has been there in the background \[for Kate\] as part of a private support network...\[They\] have a huge amount in common, having probably formed a bond very much at the beginning. Sophie was there for Kate in an unofficial capacity because she had the same experience of being a commoner marrying into the royal family,"" she continued. ""They both had really long romances with their husbands-to-be, and Sophie lived at \[Buckingham\] Palace. By the time they got married, they had more knowledge than the royal brides before them about what they were getting into.”

I've owned my  Barista Express for a little over a month and am still in the process of dialing it in. The main issue I'm running into is this:

* I make coffee for both myself or my wife
* I warm up the machine for about 5-10 minutes
* the first double espresso shot comes out pretty good. Still dialing it but overall getting there
* I clean out the portafiler and do everything the same. Same Weight and everything
* The second shot shows similar pressure and everything, but the espresso drips and sometimes gives me less than a 1:1 ratio

Here's a video. Hoping someone could provide some help!

However, one of the girls that I became friends with has been showing signs of disordered eating these days and idk how to feel…

Today she brought rice cakes and made my other friend look at the calories written on the package,  said she’ll only eat a black coffee, some sugar-free crackers and those rice cakes today. Yesterday she came late into class and the first thing she said to me was that shes sorry if she smells like vomit, then sprayed lots of perfume on herself, asked everyone if they had bubblegum…obviously she threw up on purpose for some reason that is unknown to me, since she gaslights me whenever I ask if shes okay. She keeps pointing out how fat she is, even though she isnt. And thats just the beginning

As someone who still struggles with an ED, behavior like this is *so* triggering. Seeing ED content online doesnt affect me but its so much worse in person. And thats why I relapsed. And I feel bad - shes my friend after all, she knows I’m struggling too but i doubt she’d trigger me on purpose, I feel selfish. This isnt about me, shes going through something and yet i cant help but get worse myself. Shes never been like this before apparently, and I doubt that I was the one that triggered her since I actually eat “normal” in school and im not the skinniest either. Plus shes 100% not doing all this for attention. We all tried talking to her, but nothing. Im lost, guilty and confused now

Mostly, I’m learning all of the behaviors I adopted while I was with him and after leaving. Endless stress responses and defense mechanisms. My body was rejecting him and I didn’t see it.

I would make excuses for his actions. He wouldn’t “hit” me, but he would dump food on me. He would pour coffee on me. He would shove me down onto the ground when I would try to leave. He would smash cups and bowls against the wall, flip our tables over. He would grab my phone from my hands, rip away the food I was cooking and throw it in the trash. 
And yet, I never understood why I flinched so badly when he would move his arm up, or turn around quickly. I thought to myself, “that’s weird - I wonder why I have that response, because he doesn’t hit me.”

I have noticed just recently that I always sleep with the blanket fully wrapped around me. I have to arrange it to go up and around my head like a hood. I have to tuck it under my entire body, and feel it touching my back. I didn’t understand why, until I realized that I never did that until he ripped the blankets off of me in the middle of the night while I was fast asleep and my back was turned. He screamed at me to leave the apartment.

Now, I can’t remember his face or the sound of his voice. Despite only hearing about a month ago. And I don’t feel guilty for it anymore.

1gxmta6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1gxmta6/lost/,Lost….😞 ,"It feels like I'm drowning in a sea of challenges, and I'm hoping to find some guidance from others who might understand what I'm going through. My SO and I have been together for almost 11 years, and while things were manageable when his kids (now SS20 SS20 SD14) were younger, they've changed so much as they've grown up.

When the SS's hit middle school is when things went downhill as it brought a lot of difficulties. Their behavior shifted dramatically; they were sassy, secretive, and often uncooperative. I found myself resorting to yelling just to get their attention, which was not the kind of relationship I wanted with them. They are now 20 and it has not gotten better. There are good times but more struggles than anything. This year has been especially overwhelming with multiple family health crises and my own struggles with depression and PTSD. I recently had a hospitalization due to an attempt at unaliving myself, and I've only been out for three weeks. The initial calm period was comforting with just my spouse around, but once the kids returned to our home, it felt like everything crumbled again. The past two weeks have been incredibly tough. Recovery isn't linear; some days feel okay while others are filled with despair. We had an open conversation with the kids about my hospitalization and the journey ahead, which I thought would help them understand my situation better. They initially seemed supportive and promised patience, but now it feels like that understanding has faded. I'm at a loss for what to do next or how to cope with this environment that's affecting my recovery so profoundly.

Just yesterday, my SS20 who still lives with us occasionally (he follows the visitation schedule his little sister follows) was texting me about the frustrations he was having when his twin. I was there for him and gave him advice and was just an ear. Then 8 hours later he randomly texts SO and I in a group chat that our family is crumbling and he can’t be around me anymore and I need to leave him alone. I begged him to explain what had happened between the morning and evening that made him feel this way. Then he demanded that I talk to his BM and SD. First, I don’t need to talk to his BM and SD, they are not the rulers of my house or me. I told him he needed to use his words and explain clearly to me what I had done and stop telling me who can speak to me on his behalf. No sir. So that escalated. 

A week ago, my SO and I said that sometime during the week when his kids weren’t there, we would cook a meal together. It’s something we enjoy doing together and wanted to get back into doing. I sat out the cookbook and a box of penne pasta. SO used it to cook for his daughter the last night of our visitation, which upset me. I threw away the leftovers because I felt disregarded. His daughter saw me do this and told her dad she didn't want to visit because I wasn't improving my mental health. We talked it out and it was fine. Then this week I had noticed the new jeans I bought her a month ago she still hadn’t tried on and tossed them in a drawer. I confronted her about it, calmly, and told her it hurts me when I spend my own money on new clothes for her and she just tosses them in a drawer. She said she forgot to try them on and was sorry and said she’d try them on next time she was at our house. She does this often with anything I get her. She tells me she wants things and I'll get it. Then she comes up with some excuse not to wear them or use the things. So I get upset and tell her well they are getting donated to someone who will wear them. Then I'm a monster. I manage a Greenlight account for SD14, providing her with an allowance since I am the primary breadwinner in our household. However, I’ve noticed that she frequently spends her money on frivolous items, despite claiming to be saving for an iPad or AirPods. Just this week, she spent $30 at Scooter’s Coffee. I confronted her about it, emphasizing the importance of controlling her spending habits. If she doesn’t learn to manage her finances now, she could face significant challenges as she gets older. In an effort to guide her, I transferred some funds from her general spending account to her Scooter’s Coffee account. This upset her, and she began to cry. She reported the situation to her BM, who then contacted my SO, accusing me of withholding money from her. Consequently, my SD14 now claims that I am backtracking on my promises, that she feels uncomfortable around me, and that she doesn’t want to come over for visitation this weekend.

All in all I have no clue what to do. Do I just remove myself from a relationship with these kids who are so easy to throw away someone who has been in their lives for over a decade? My SO tries to support me but he supports them more. I already have made the choice not to have a relationship with one SS20. But I have no bio kids of my own and I’ve always seen them as my own. I’ve not been perfect, I’ll admit that, their Dad hasn’t been perfect, and they haven’t been easy to raise. 

Sincerely,
Somebody tell me what to do.",1,1732321589.0,stepparents,1,1.0,False

1gxmpv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1gxmpv4/rules_that_help_you/,Rules that help you ? ,"I have found that apart from calorie counting certain restrictions help me not to binge ! They are as follows: 

• No bread at home. Leads to binging every. single. time. But I can have it while eating out ( since it’s not the bread that’s the problem, but the fact that i cannot control my portion size myself ). I also have replaced it with crispbread which eliviates a craving for bread but it doesn’t cause overeating 

• If I have something sweet it has to be pastry from a bakery. No chocolate, no bars, no cookies, no cakes. I personally found that it’s the perfect combination of 1) satisfaction 2) portion size. I just buy a single croissant or a muffin. 

• No coffee at home. Coffee makes me want to eat sugar. So cutting both out at the same time is helpful.

• Having pasta only once a week. I love it, but it’s not very calorie deficit friendly. 

• No zero sugar drinks ( or anything ) !  Just eat something with sugar. Zero sugar drinks are a gateway drug to overindulgence ( also not very good for my stomach ) 

• No sodas! While they can be fit into a deficit I’m never satisfied after finishing it ( unlike with pastry ). 

•If i want fast food I go to Macdonald’s and have a cheeseburger with smallest fries & water. Kills that craving for fast food & fills me & is easily fitting into caloric deficit.

• If i drink I aim for maintenance ( & 1800 instead of 1500 for the next day ) ",5,1732321318.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

Embracing polyamory with a Christian spouse,"Inspired by the other wonderful bi-sexual redditor who is finding acceptance and joy in their new identify in Christ, I'm accepting myself as I am, too.


While it's taken years of asking ""Who am I?"" to  realize that I may never have the answers, I'm continuing the path I genuinely believe is the right one from me.

I was a born again Christian for over a decade, and God still plays extremely important role in my life. Without guilt and shame. I lean heavily towards non-duality and separation not being real, but that's a topic for another day.

Tomorrow is another coffee date. Freedom, to choose, who I am. I choose to connect. And this usually means friendship instead of something romantic for me, it the beauty of my current dynamic is that it can be whatever is right in the moment. 


Did I leave Christianity so that I can have guilt free pass to do as I please? I did not. I left Christianity because I found that God is far greater than a single religion could ever imagine. Jesus is God, sure. But more God than anyone else with a Soul? See, not so sure about that. Especially if all is God.


Yet, the freedom I found in Christ, has remained in my life. Knowing that following truth is freedom. And there is never too far to run, because it's impossible to be separate from Him. The oxygen in our lungs is his creation. His heartbeat. His joy.


We are all different. We all choose different paths. We all have our own convictions. We all strive to love. And through that, find pain. And can cause pain.

Yet, here we are. In the moment that He holds us. Finding peace.",0,1732321123.0,Christianity,10,0.44,False

I fell like Olivia has every right to be mad at Peter. Hell she could be mad at everyone atp . But mostly Peter. In her pov: you telling me I've been STUCK on the otherside been probe with needles Day in to day out. Having these people trying to Gaslight me into thinking I'm not Me. And then it works for a bit. Then I regained who I am.  And I'm going through all these trails and tribulations to get Back Home.. to YOU. I get back and you done have a whole ass relationship with with this girl?! Yall done fucked and everything. 

What pisses me off the most when peter was in the alternate universe he said that the olivia and alt olivia eyes where the same but Olivia eyes were darker. So yall must've been fucking with yall eyes close or something?!

Everytime you looked at her I MEAN DOWN TO HOW THEY WALK. Alt Olivia STRUTS when she walks usually Olivia walks kinda stiff.

I mean how couldn't you tell it wasn't her?!!!
To think olivia would've immediately start a relationship with you after yall got back from the otherside is crazy 😭. 

And then the reasons he gave Olivia were bullshit 

""I knew something was different but I just thought about what happened Over there and what y- I mean what she told me that she saw how her life was on the other side and she wanted to changed""

""She was quick with a smile""

I mean down to the god damn coffee.
From how nice and patient she was with Walter
From how quick she wanted to be with you

Olivia deserves to feel this way.  She deserves to be able to be upset and pissed. Alt just took over Olivia life and Noone notice.

[Strangers to Something More] [Tsundere] [Grumpy Barista] [Festive] [Mild Flirting] [Reverse Comfort]","Yes, may as well get a month ahead of the curve...

**Context:** After some Christmas shopping, you get yourself some coffee from a grumpy barista. But when you get talking, you learn there’s more to them than meets the eye…

**Setting:** Busy mall/shopping centre.

\*\*\*

\[You’re in a busy coffee shop in a busy mall/shopping centre after a long period of Christmas shopping, waiting in line.\]

\[SFX: Background chatter of a packed shop, Christmas music.\]

“Hey, can I take your order?”

\[Pause.\]

\[In an irritated tone:\] “Hey, can I get you anything? \[Short pause as you reply.\] Right! Thank you. Guess you were miles away. Somewhere a million times better than here - wish I could escape so easily. I’d lose this job in a heartbeat if I was daydreaming that much, and that would probably be the best outcome. \[Very briskly, so the words blend together.\] So, will you be having that in?” 

\[Pause.\] 

\[With painstaking deliberation:\] “I said, will - you - be - drinking - this - in - or? \[Very short pause as you reply.\] Good. Maybe I need to work on diction, I’ll add it to the pile of many improvements I’ve got to make. And yeah, I was going to say, if you were going to drink this in here, you’d have a hard time finding room to sit, even without your five hundred bags. Guess everyone had the same idea of doing their last-minute shopping today. With a proper application game theory, someone should have worked out that the best time to do their Christmas shopping is a time when nobody else is. Though, I guess that would be hard to work out exactly. Unless you did it in the dead of night when nothing was open, and even us poor suckers aren’t still working.”

\[SFX: They ring up your order.\]

“OK, that’ll be £4.20. You heard that, right? OK, just checking. Are you actually going to be able to carry that with all your bags? \[Pause.\] Wow, OK, you’re more talented than me. \[Sighs\] Look, I’m sorry, I know I’m not being very festive, to say the least, but…”

\[They trail off, then…\]

“Hang on, I’ve seen you before, haven’t I? No, I’m pretty sure I have. You might not have seen me, but you were in here the other day, reading…yeah, I noticed because that’s one of my absolute favourite books! Wow…now, I sound like a stalker…look, I was just…mildly intrigued somebody else had a decent enough taste in literature, OK? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to get back to…”

\[Pause as you say something.\]

“What? Join you for coffee? After everything I said to you? You must be a masochist of some kind. Haven’t you got people waiting for you? All those presents tell a story…”

\[Another pause.\]

“OK…tell you what - my shift actually finishes in like five minutes. If you’re still around then, do you want to meet in that charity bookshop? They have nice chairs there. \[Pause as you reply.\] OK, awesome. See you in a bit then. And I’ll get a nice strong Americano to rejuvenate myself, but not from here. I’ve been working here long enough that I can no longer enjoy their stuff, which is just another downside that they offer. \[Addressing another customer:\] Yes, sorry. Can I take your order…?”

\[Background noise fades out, and when it fades in again, it’s much more muffled. Time has passed and the location has changed, there’s much less background noise here.\]

\[SFX: Shop door bell as door opens.\]

\[Slightly out of breath:\] “OK, I’m so sorry I’m late. Umm…\[Then, with a degree of defensiveness:\] But, you know what? You dawdled with your order, so I’d say we’re even. I may also have already got myself an Americano. Yes, I know that’s cheating, and possibly lying, but I need to be prepared to dash off quickly if anything else happens. \[Pause.\] No, if I wanted to get away from you, I would have just refused coffee with you in the first place. Against all odds…I actually wanted to.”

\[Pause as you both sip coffee, taking in the atmosphere.\]

“OK, I’m sorry…I think we got off on the wrong foot. That’s mostly my fault. When you’ve been working in customer service for as long as I have…OK, it hasn’t been that long, but when you’ve been working somewhere as busy as I have, you get very familiar with the worst customer service has to offer. Some of them are fine, obviously, but I’ve learned to steel myself. ‘Yes sir, the price on the menu is the actual price.’ ‘No ma’am, I can’t make your coffee before the previous customer’s.’ Those kind of people. And management do not bloody help, no wonder the customers always think they’ll take their side.”

\[SFX: They sip their coffee quite aggressively, then suddenly stop.\]

“Oh God, that was a mistake. Ahh, that’s hot! \[Pause, then, with a smile in their voice:\] Oh, shut up. Yes, I know I should have known better working in the industry of scalding hot drinks, but if I can forgive you for being absent-minded, surely you can show the same courtesy. Because, honestly…it wasn’t fair of me to treat you like the worst of the customers. Maybe I wanted an excuse to talk to you. Tell me something - were you absent-minded because your mind was on books?”

\[Pause.\]

“OK, but am I right in thinking that they’re often on your mind? OK, yeah, good. So, what was it this time? Distracted by my gorgeous face? Or maybe it was so hideous you were just lost for words. \[Off your insistence to the contrary:\] That’s sweet of you, but we both know I’m not going to be the face of any coffee chain any time soon, no matter how svelte the uniform is. So, what was on your mind?”

\[Pause.\]

“So you’re saying you haven’t actually finished your Christmas shopping yet? I felt like those bags told a story. Or maybe I shouldn’t be surprised that you're the kind of person people actually want presents from. I can tell you mine got done very quickly, and that was back when I actually felt like seeing the family. \[Pause.\] That’s a story for another time. I want to hear about you. How many people have you still got to get presents for? \[Pause as you reply.\] OK, and how many of them do you think books would be suitable for? Because surely books are suitable for everyone.”

\[Pause.\]

“Actually yeah, I see your point. I’m certainly not sure of anyone I would trust to buy the right book for me - it’s sheer luck that we actually have similar tastes. But that’s kind of how book tokens got started. There was a publisher in the 1920s - I think his name was Harold…umm…Harold Raymond, that was it. He realised that there was a risk in buying someone a book because you couldn’t guarantee they’d actually like it, so something that could be exchanged for any book someone wanted was ultimately the better option. It takes a little bit of the personal touch out of it, but in the end maybe some people aren’t suited for that.”

\[Pause.\]

“Oh yes, I really am the spirit of the season. But perhaps I’m just unfairly trying to dump my own gloom onto your adorable sunshine. So, I expect you have slightly more social plans for Christmas? \[Pause as you reply.\] Oh, quite a few people you say. Well, what I want to know is - because I’m still trying to get the measure of you, you’re a bit of an enigma - what does someone who likes to read alone in coffee shops do at a Christmas social event?”

\[You reply, and they burst out laughing.\]

“An audiobook listening party? \[They give another genuine belly-laugh.\] Oh, that is actually amazing. No, seriously, that’s actually a really good idea. I’m just so impressed you have enough people with the patience for that. And enough people who don’t eat the snacks too loudly so you miss something important! \[They laugh for a bit longer, before recovering, still tickled.\] OK, so - what’s the audiobook, something festive?”

\[Pause.\]

“Oh yeah, voting on it’s a good idea actually. *A Christmas Carol* is fine, but a bit basic. Ideally, you’d want something nobody had heard or read before. \[Pause, as you ask a question.\] What am I doing for Christmas? \[They sigh.\] Honestly, I have no idea. But increasingly, I’m feeling that I might be better off spending it alone. That might be the best thing for my sanity.”

\[SFX: They finish their coffee, set the mug down, pull their chair closer towards you and begin speaking in an undertone.\]

“I hate that barista job. But it pays the bills and it keeps me occupied. In theory, anyway. Ideally, I’d be working somewhere like this, with books, but perhaps I just don't have the right demeanour, or I’m more of a disappointment than I thought. I mean, that’s what my mum calls me. Or maybe she said that about my dad - in any case, their divorce will probably be finalised by this time next year, and whilst that will probably be a relief in many ways, I could really do without them both of them dragging me into it, even though I’m a grown-ass adult so custody is irrelevant, and I should be making my own way in life. But maybe I let them drag me into it a bit because…it’s nice to feel wanted? Or, nice to feel the illusion of being wanted. Yes, I’m just ammunition, but I’m still being fought over, y’know? They’re both trying my patience now, but if I don’t spend Christmas with either of them…? Well, everyone else I could call a friend has other plans. They’re abroad, or at university, or married and living elsewhere without a care in the world. I don’t expect any of them to make arrangements for me to change that, so I’m either alone or with grumpy family members, and I have to choose which one. I mean, maybe I could contact one of my sort-of friends in a feeble attempt to get them to take me on out of pity, but…I think I’d just feel *so* pathetic.”

\[Pause.\]

“On the subject of which, I have just shared way too much. I’m so sorry! But…\[suddenly decisive:\] OK, I’ve gone this far, I may as way bite the bullet. The fact that you’re not backing away from me slowly - or quickly - is a good sign, so I want to make a request to join your little listening party because, even in the very brief period in which I’ve known you, suddenly, I think I’d like to spend Christmas with you. Yeah, I know, maybe that’s pathetic, and obviously I understand we’re practically strangers, but…even as I’m reminded of every shitty thing going on in my sad and sorry life, I’m thinking it’ll be OK if I just say, help you with your Christmas shopping. Browse books in here with you. Discuss the finer points of the corniest festive movies. Learn more about what you do when you have a bunch of friends as adorkable as you around - I don’t know how this makes me sound, but when you brought up that you actually do a listening party…God, I haven’t laughed like that in forever. I don’t know what it is about you, and maybe this’ll make me sound like a stalker again, but I just feel you could light things up this Christmas for me. If only for a week, a day, an hour. Perhaps we can just get to know each other before you decide if I’m worthy of joining you and your friends? It’s entirely up to you…what do you say?”

\[Your response gives them a relieved, almost tearful laugh.\]

“Oh my god, thank you! I really hope what I can give you is beyond this pathetic neediness. Why don’t we start right now? \[Pause as you reply.\] OK, awesome, I have tons of time now too, so why not make a start here? We both know this place very well, so, I shall try my best to prove myself to you with my profound insights on the finer and less fine points of literature. I may even be able to pick out the best option for your present. \[Off your insistence:\] Oh yes I do. It’s the least I could do for you, given you’re making this festive season something more than just monotonous gloom. Nothing will be too good, and I think I need to start as soon as possible. So, come on - we’re in a bookshop, the greatest kind of place on Earth. Which section shall we go to first?”

1gxmjxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/seniorkitties/comments/1gxmjxu/a_letter_to_my_gilbert_12/,A letter to my Gilbert (12),"For a little background, Gilbert and I are doing a photoshoot next week as part of a new coffee table book that's coming out called ""Unconditional"" and it's all based around pet portraits and letters written by owners to their pets. I had to somehow boil down all of my feelings for this cat to under 300 words... and I still haven't quite whittled it down enough, but I don't know which words are left that aren't needed... so if anyone wants to take a stab at editing it, I'd appreciate it. 

G was diagnosed with small cell GI lymphoma this summer and while he's doing quite well between the chemo and steroids and prescription diets and acupuncture, we still know that our time is limited and probably counted in months instead of years. So this is the letter I've written to him for the project so far. 

\----

 In the beginning, God created heaven and earth… and Gilbert. 



We’ve always joked that you were immortal. From the day that I met you when you were dropped off at my clinic by the police, there was something in your eyes that said you’d been here before. You had a little too much poise and confidence for this to be the first time you’d ridden in the back of a cop car. You were infinite. You had just always… been. And always would be. 



But this year, we found out that wasn’t true. 



And now I find myself preparing for the end of our time together. Watching you get older has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done… but I can’t deny that there is an honor there that after how many millennia you’ve spent on this earth, you've chosen me to walk you out. 



You are everyone’s best friend, but I am **your** best friend and nothing in my life has ever made me feel more special than that. 



Thank you. Thank you for your patience. For your love. For tolerating your siblings and too many foster kittens. For making us better. For picking us. For escorting me and your dad and Natalia through more phases of life than it feels should fit into a single decade.



To know you is to love you. From all across this country, people who have never even met you, love you. You have a presence that’s larger than life and you have indelibly changed everyone you’ve met. You’re the Magic Man… but I know that you know that. After all, I’ve told you at least ten times a day for the last ten years. 



I hope you know that you’re loved… but even then, know that it is SO much more than you think it is. I don’t think this is the first time our paths have crossed and I don’t think it will be the last, my boy. 



Love, 

Mama

I love animals, I have a dog, I work at an animal rescue part time. x I like painting and stuff too, and minecraft or other 'creative' games, and my 'special interests' are marine zoology and zelda. I like a lot of things basically, so i'm sure we can find something in common. 

I like cooking, food is how I express affection. I'm not the best chef ever but I really appreciate it when people enjoy my food, so expect a lot of treats if we're together. x

I'd really love a special friend/platonic partner, who's nearby since I find talking online and doing long distance really difficult.

I like quiet relaxed meetups, like walking dogs or getting coffee. I'm disabled so I can't travel very much, so DM and i'll let you know what town i'm in if you'd like to meet up. I like trying new cafes and resturaunts, so if you have a favourite place, please take me there. :3

  
My ideal partner is someone who is clear and straightforward, since i'm autistic and don't always pick up on hints. I really truly care about you, but you need to tell me how you're feeling. :)

Also, someone who respects my boundaries. : I'm not entirely averse to sex, but I have a lot of 'hard no's'. (Wierdly, the more vanilla it is, the more likely I am to say no.) 

If sex is important to you, we aren't compatable. I find it very stressful to feel like I have to 'earn' someones love through sex, so i'd rather have an entirely platonic relationship than not be able to meet someones needs.

Also, 20+ only please. x I don't have an upper limit on age, but the closer to 25 the better. 

I also really like it when someone is very passionate about their hobbies and interests and i'm happy to sit and listen to you infodump. x I enjoy that. So don't ever be afraid to talk about your special interests with me.

No restrictions on timezones, age, relationship status, religious beliefs, etc. However, if you like to stay fit and are into exercising, or planning to get into exercising, that'd be a big plus!

In September, I went to his school to take advantage of a vendor fair for student discounts. While we were there, one of his classmates, “XXXX” (F, ~30), came over to say hi. We had met briefly when his program began. When she approached, my husband immediately started praising her skills, saying, “She’s really good—she’s the best here. I’m going to ask her to do my [procedure].”

I’ve been telling him for years to get this done and have even offered to do it myself (it’s in my area of expertise), but he’s always brushed it off with “later.” Hearing him say this in front of me, her, and their classmates made me feel small, but I didn’t say anything at the time.


Then, one day they had a pharmacology final, and he goes “I don’t know why YYYY (a different female classmate) is asking ZZZZ (a guy in his class) about the Pharmacology exam when her husband is an actual pharmacist” so I said, “I’m also an actual *****, but you said that you want XXXX to do your ^procedure^ so ¿?” and what he said later is the reason why I’m writing this post -we’ve been married for 8 years- he got a little nervous and he said “it’s different, those two one is a ***** from (any country) the other one is a pharmacist from the US; and you two are both ***** just that one is better than the other”. I think he realized what he had said a second after the words left his mouth, and said “well, no, I didn’t mean to say it that way, you know what I’m trying to say” —— I was getting ready to go to work, I’m the only one that works since he is a full time student. — I laughed and said “I know exactly what you are saying, better stop trying to explain yourself because you’re making it worse. If you keep talking we’re going to divorce, hahaha” and left. Passive aggressive, I know, but I was upset and tried to conceal it so we didn’t fight at 7 a.m. 

Well, after that, I became completely conscious of his words about her, and I started to notice that he talks about her all the time. I told him already that it makes me uncomfortable that he is getting too close. She is married, and currently, apparently also having issues with her husband. I know this because my husband made a comment about it, and I asked how do you know? He goes “she was almost crying. I asked her what was wrong and she told me.” Then I asked, just you or your group of friends? (There are 3 other women being him the only man in their “group”) and he said “no, she told ME only”. I told him that I don’t think it is appropriate that he is getting so involved and that I feel uncomfortable with the idea of my husband being son-comforting and considerate to another woman. 

Now, I feel like he is hiding things from me. I think they’re spending more time together than they should. And also when he is home, he is texting her. The other morning I caught him asking her how she was feeling, how she had slept, and saying good morning, sending her a pic of his breakfast. !!! Texting her “if you get there before me, make some coffee for me.” She saying “of course ❤️”.

This situation … It is eating me alive, and I hate feeling this way. Everything was just fine, and now I’m thinking about it all the time. We basically spend only dinner time and sat/sun together, and we have a toddler. So the moments we’re home, we’re also taking care of the baby. And now we’re having fights frequently because I tried to have a conversation with him explaining how this situation is making me feel so insecure and uncomfortable and that I don’t like what he is doing, how he is looking out for her, and being so attentive. And he said that I’m just being intense,  that he can’t be rude, that he doesn’t know what to do, that if I want “he will stop talking to everyone” so that I don’t feel bad. He says that I’m exaggerating and that there’s nothing wrong, nothing is going on, and I am just being too much.

I think that the part that made me feel strange was that he actually thinks she is better than me. It made a click in my head realizing that he admires her. Ah, okay, she is smart and pretty too. I think he has a crush on her. I feel super sad.

My question is, am I really being too sensitive about it? Is it really inoffensive “normal behavior” and I just too insecure and jealous?",1,1732320214.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

Oh the box of tacks that was on top of the cupboard just opened on their own. The coffee grounds that were in the freezer just fell off the counter.

And these are examples from the last two days...it's never ending.  It's not like she's just left unsupervised either. It's when your in the bathroom, or changing a diaper, or step to another room. 

And she keeps getting into food too, non stop! This one really baffles me because we are not the parents to say no to food. All she has to do is ask and she will get it, but she's sneaking it away and hiding the evidence in her room.

I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

Anyway, thanks for reading all that. Hope to hear from you!",0,1732320045.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

1gxm395,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Open-Scientist9052/comments/1gxm395/the_office_hire_chapter_two_the_ripple_effect/,(THE OFFICE HIRE) Chapter Two | The Ripple Effect,"The morning after Lila Rivers’ chaotic first presentation, the office was alive with gossip. Her awkward stumble through the meeting and the awkward silence that followed were still fresh in everyone’s mind, and employees had no qualms about discussing it among themselves. The walls of the open-plan office seemed to reverberate with laughter, judgment, and curiosity.

Lila, walking into the employee lounge with a cup of coffee in her hand, tried her best to tune it all out. But the whispers and giggles were unmistakable as she walked past the breakroom, and she could feel every pair of eyes on her. It was as if she had a spotlight on her at all times now.

""Did you see that? She tripped on the power cord!"" said one voice, a woman with a snarky edge. It was Brittany, a fellow marketing analyst who always seemed to find the humor in someone else's discomfort. ""Honestly, I thought she was going to cry when Ford looked at her like that.""

""Yeah, but did you hear what she said after?"" another voice chimed in. It was Derek, from accounts, who often had a way of exaggerating any story. ""She made this weird joke about a cloud system and no one’s getting hurt unless a pigeon flies through it... Who says that in a room full of execs?""

The group of employees surrounding the coffee machine burst into laughter, their voices loud enough that Lila couldn’t ignore them. She could already feel the heat creeping up her neck as she tried to keep a neutral expression. Lila bit her lip, trying not to let their words sting, but they did.

Another voice, a bit quieter but still audible, spoke up: ""I don’t know… she seems like she could be smart, though, you know? Like, yeah, she’s awkward, but she’s got something there. I saw her laptop during the meeting—InsightSync looked solid.""

Lila’s heart lifted a little at the unexpected compliment, but it quickly sank back down as Brittany shot back, “Yeah, but she’s so unorganized. Did you see how she fumbled through her notes? She’s a walking disaster.”

""She'll never make it,"" Derek added, shaking his head with a grin that didn’t quite match the weight of his words. ""No one lasts long with Ford if they can’t pull their weight.""

The conversation continued to swirl around Lila, her presence almost invisible to the group despite standing only a few feet away. As much as it stung, she wasn’t surprised. She'd heard the stories of Ethan Ford's ruthlessness, how he could chew up and spit out anyone who didn’t meet his standards. Lila knew she had a long road ahead of her if she wanted to prove herself in this cutthroat environment.

But instead of crumbling under the gossip, she simply raised her chin and gave herself a small, quiet smile. Lila always believed in her ability to bounce back, no matter how much life threw at her. Her father’s old words echoed in her head: “You fall down, you get back up. That’s how you get ahead in life.”

She had her quirks—her dad jokes, her bad fashion sense, her inability to keep things organized—but Lila had a way of finding silver linings in the clouds. Sure, she’d made a fool of herself in front of Ethan Ford, but that didn’t mean she was done for.

She took a deep breath, straightening her posture, and then—just as the group of employees began to notice her standing there—Lila flashed them a bright smile, not the kind of forced grin that said ""I’m fine,"" but the kind that showed she wasn’t backing down.

""Hey guys,"" Lila said cheerfully, raising her coffee cup in greeting, “I know my presentation wasn’t exactly how I planned, but hey, at least I didn’t trip on a wire and knock over a table...yet."" She chuckled lightly, hoping the joke would land. The room fell into an awkward silence for a moment, and then a few of them, including Brittany, burst into reluctant laughter.

Lila gave them all a wink. ""Give me a few more tries. I’m just warming up.""

She could feel their gazes shift slightly. The edges of their smirks faded, replaced by a sense of hesitation. Lila wasn’t defeated. Far from it. Sure, she was the clumsy new hire who hadn’t impressed anyone just yet—but she wasn’t going to be easily broken by some office gossip. And if they wanted to keep talking about her, well, she’d just have to show them what she was really made of.

As Lila made her way back to her cubicle, she noticed the shift. The whispers grew quieter, the laughter dissipating. A few curious glances followed her, but this time, she felt their judgment less sharply.

---

Meanwhile, in the executive suite, Ethan Ford sat behind his massive, minimalist desk, eyes glued to his computer screen. He'd overheard the gossip filtering through the halls—whispers about the clumsy new hire who had fumbled her way through the presentation.

While he typically paid no attention to such office chatter, something about Lila's presentation had piqued his interest. He wasn’t one to make snap judgments based on a single incident, no matter how glaring it had been. Ethan was calculating and precise, always looking for the underlying reasons behind actions.

Lila Rivers had stumbled, yes. But what intrigued him was how she hadn’t immediately collapsed under the weight of the failure. Instead of running for the door, she had simply brushed off her mistake, picked up the pieces of her presentation, and continued with her pitch, albeit clumsily. There was something in the way she handled the pressure that sparked his curiosity—a quiet defiance, a refusal to fall apart in the face of a public misstep. It was refreshing.

As the day wore on, Ethan found himself glancing at her cubicle through the frosted glass wall of his office. Lila had returned to her desk after the meeting, and although he could only see her silhouette, it was hard to ignore her energy. There was a liveliness to her presence, even in the wake of her embarrassing start.

""Interesting,"" he murmured under his breath, turning his attention back to the spreadsheet in front of him. But his mind kept drifting back to Lila’s strange combination of clumsiness and resilience.

---

By the time Lila had returned to her desk, trying to ignore the heat of her flushed cheeks and the occasional stares, the buzz of the office had almost died down. She focused on sorting through the pile of emails that had accumulated overnight, trying to keep her mind occupied with something productive. She needed to recover. She needed to prove she wasn’t just the clumsy new hire.

That was when it happened.

Her inbox pinged.

The subject line: Marketing Strategy Follow-Up.

With a mix of dread and curiosity, Lila opened the email. Her heart skipped when she saw the sender’s name.

From: Ethan Aurelius Ford
Subject: Marketing Strategy Follow-Up

Her stomach churned.

> Miss Rivers,
I expect a full report on your InsightSync strategy by the end of the week. Include projected costs, potential risks, and an implementation timeline. Deliver it personally.
Regards,
Ethan Ford

Lila blinked, trying to comprehend what she had just read. She read it again, slower this time, as if expecting the words to change. But no. Ethan had asked her to provide a full report. And not just any report—one that she knew would carry weight. It was clear that Mr. Ford didn’t mince words when it came to business, and his expectations were high.

Her first instinct was to run. But there was no way out of this. She had to rise to the challenge. There was no turning back.

“I... I was just getting the hang of things,” she muttered to herself, her mind already spiraling. ""A full report in three days? Is he serious?""

Her gaze fell on the coffee cup in her hand, as though it would provide her with some clarity or at least a moment of comfort. But nothing about the situation felt comfortable. Instead, she felt a strange sense of responsibility stir within her. This was her chance to prove herself—to show Ethan Ford that she wasn’t just the scatterbrained rookie who had fumbled her first meeting.

Still, the question remained—what exactly was this InsightSync strategy? It had been part of the pitch, but she hadn’t had time to familiarize herself with all the details. Now, she had three days to piece it all together, present a flawless report, and deliver it straight into the hands of a man who was more accustomed to perfection than anything remotely close to failure.

Sasha walked by, glancing at Lila’s computer screen. “You got an email from him, didn’t you?”

Lila nodded, her voice strained. “Yeah. I’ve been tasked with delivering a full report on InsightSync by the end of the week.”

Sasha raised an eyebrow. “Oh boy. That’s not a small task. I hope you’re ready.”

“I have no choice but to be,” Lila replied, a mix of nervousness and determination settling in her chest.

---

By lunch, Lila’s desk was a flurry of papers, sticky notes, and hastily scribbled ideas. She had three days to compile data, run numbers, and create a report that wouldn’t make Ethan regret hiring her.

Her cubicle neighbor, Sasha, peeked over the divider. “Hey, you okay? You look like you’re mapping out a battle plan.”

“I am,” Lila replied, eyes wild. “It’s called Operation Impress the Boss Before He Fires Me.”

Sasha snorted. “Good luck. Mr. Ford isn’t exactly known for his patience.”

“I know,” Lila sighed. “But I’m not going down without a fight. If he wants the best report he’s ever seen, then that’s exactly what he’s getting.”

---

Certainly! Here's an expanded version of the elevator scene with more descriptive details and Ethan’s observations:

---

As Lila waited for the elevator, her thoughts were a swirling mess of to-do lists, half-formed plans, and a growing sense of dread about her first real assignment under Ethan Ford’s scrutiny. The elevator doors slid open, and she stepped in without looking up, juggling her tablet, notebook, and a precariously balanced coffee cup.

Just as the doors began to close, a firm hand pressed against the sensor. Lila looked up to see none other than him—Ethan Aurelius Ford. The CEO. Her boss. The man whose approval carried more weight than gravity in this company.

Ethan stepped in, his movements deliberate and composed, the tailored lines of his dark suit cutting a sharp figure. His presence seemed to draw all the oxygen out of the confined space, leaving Lila scrambling to remember how to breathe. He didn’t acknowledge her immediately, his sharp gray eyes fixed on his phone as he scrolled through what must have been an endless stream of important emails. His aura was intimidating yet magnetic, like a silent storm brewing just beneath his composed surface.

The doors slid shut, and the elevator began its smooth ascent. The silence was deafening.

Lila, determined to break the tension, decided to speak up. Say something professional and insightful, she thought. Instead, what came out was:
“So, Mr. Ford… do you prefer the stairs or elevators?”

Ethan’s fingers paused mid-scroll. He turned his head slowly to look at her, his expression unreadable. The air between them seemed to thicken under the weight of his gaze. For a moment, Lila panicked. Was that the dumbest question he’d ever heard? Probably.

“I prefer efficiency,” he replied after a beat, his tone cool and clipped. He returned his attention to his phone, but Lila noticed the faintest quirk of his brow, as if he were debating whether her comment was worth any further thought.

She grinned awkwardly, feeling the need to fill the silence. “Right. Efficiency. Makes sense. Though, you know, they say taking the stairs is great for cardio. Builds endurance. Not that you need it—you seem like you’re in great shape. Not that I was looking or anything. I mean—”
Her words tumbled out faster than her brain could stop them, and she abruptly cut herself off, her cheeks burning with embarrassment.

Ethan didn’t respond, but his eyes flicked toward her for the briefest moment before returning to his phone. It was subtle—barely perceptible—but it was enough to make Lila want to sink through the floor. Why do I keep talking? she berated herself internally.

The elevator dinged softly, signaling a stop on another floor. A pair of employees entered, whispering amongst themselves. Lila caught their sidelong glances and stifled giggles, undoubtedly aware of her mortifying attempt at small talk with the CEO. She held her head high, offering them a polite smile. If they were going to laugh, at least she’d give them something to talk about.

Ethan, however, seemed oblivious to the exchange. Or perhaps he simply didn’t care. His focus remained laser-sharp, his demeanor as still and unshakable as granite.

But in reality, Ethan wasn’t entirely as detached as he seemed. While his eyes stayed on his phone, his mind lingered on the peculiar woman beside him. He replayed her flustered commentary about stairs and cardio, noting how her nervous energy seemed to spill over in waves. She’s clumsy, he thought. Unpolished. Lacks restraint.

Yet, there was something oddly... refreshing about her. Unlike the others in his orbit, who either fawned over him or froze in his presence, Lila Rivers seemed incapable of concealing her genuine self. It was as though she hadn’t yet learned—or cared—to hide behind the masks most wore in the corporate world.

The elevator reached their floor, and Ethan stepped out first, his stride purposeful and unhurried. He didn’t glance back, but he spoke, his deep voice cutting through the air like a knife:
“Miss Rivers, my office. Five minutes.”

Lila froze in place, the realization dawning on her that she was about to have her first one-on-one meeting with The Ethan Ford. She barely managed to stammer out a reply before the elevator doors closed behind her, leaving her alone with her thoughts.

As she hurried down the hall, her mind raced with possibilities. Had she done something wrong? Was her assignment already a failure? Or—worst of all—was this about her attempt at elevator banter?

Ethan, meanwhile, reached his office and set his phone on the desk. His mind flitted briefly back to the encounter in the elevator. She was a contradiction—nervous yet bold, chaotic yet sincere. For reasons he couldn’t quite pinpoint, Ethan found himself curious to see how this free-spirited, unpolished new hire would fare under his exacting standards.

---

Here’s an expanded version of the scene where Lila delivers the report:

---

Lila stood outside Ethan Ford’s office door, the weight of the folder in her hands feeling disproportionate to its actual contents. Her heart hammered in her chest as she mentally rehearsed her lines for what felt like the hundredth time. Just be confident. Clear. Concise. You’ve got this.

Taking a deep breath, she knocked twice.

“Enter.”

Ethan’s voice carried through the heavy door, calm yet commanding. Lila pushed it open and stepped inside, immediately feeling the chill of his minimalist office. The space was an extension of the man himself—sharp, immaculate, and devoid of unnecessary frills. Floor-to-ceiling windows bathed the room in natural light, illuminating the dark wood and steel furniture. Ethan sat behind his sleek desk, his expression as unreadable as ever.

“Miss Rivers,” he said without looking up, his eyes scanning his monitor. “You have five minutes.”

The pressure hit Lila like a tidal wave, but she forced herself to smile as she approached the desk. “Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Ford. I’ve compiled the report you requested on potential strategies for the new product launch.”

She placed the folder on his desk with a little too much enthusiasm, causing the pen holder nearby to wobble precariously. Ethan’s eyes flicked to the disturbance before finally settling on her. His gaze was sharp, assessing, as though he were dissecting her with a single glance.

“Proceed.”

Lila swallowed hard and opened the folder. She adjusted her glasses, which had slipped down her nose, and launched into her presentation.

“So, um, I analyzed the current market trends, consumer preferences, and emerging technologies, and I believe we can gain a competitive edge by integrating AI-driven personalization into the user interface. This would allow us to—”

She paused abruptly as a loud thud echoed in the room. Her notebook, which had been perched precariously on the edge of the desk, had slid off and landed on the floor.

“Oops,” she muttered, her cheeks flushing as she bent down to retrieve it. “Sorry about that!”

Ethan didn’t say a word, his expression remaining as impassive as ever. Lila straightened up, her notebook in hand, and plastered on a nervous smile. “As I was saying, the AI integration could provide tailored user experiences, which—get this—could potentially increase customer retention rates by up to 25%. Isn’t that cool?”

Ethan raised an eyebrow, his lips pressing into a thin line.

Lila froze. Oh no. Did I just say ‘cool’?

Realizing she might be losing him, she scrambled to get back on track. “What I mean is, it’s an exciting opportunity to leverage data analytics for growth. And if we pair that with targeted marketing campaigns—”

She flipped to another page in her notes but accidentally skipped a few, causing her to lose her place. Flustered, she shuffled the papers around, muttering under her breath. “Where is it? Oh, here! Okay, so, targeted campaigns—”

Ethan leaned back in his chair, his steely eyes fixed on her. “Miss Rivers.”

She froze, her fingers gripping the edges of her notes. “Y-Yes?”

“You’re unorganized.” His voice was calm but carried a weight that made her stomach drop.

“I... I know,” she admitted sheepishly, her shoulders slumping. “But I promise, the content is solid. I just—” She stopped herself, deciding against further excuses. Instead, she straightened her spine and met his gaze. “I may be a little... messy, but I stand by my ideas. They’re good. And I think you’ll see that if you give them a chance.”

For a moment, there was silence. Ethan’s expression didn’t change, but something flickered in his eyes—curiosity, perhaps? He picked up the folder, opened it, and began skimming the pages.

Lila stood there awkwardly, shifting her weight from one foot to the other. She caught sight of her reflection in the glass window behind him and cringed inwardly. Her blouse was slightly wrinkled, and her hair had come loose from its clip during her flustered presentation. Great. I look like I just rolled out of bed.

Ethan closed the folder with a soft thud and set it down.

“Your ideas are unconventional,” he said finally, his tone neutral. “But they have potential.”

Lila blinked, unsure if that was a compliment or a polite way of saying ‘not terrible.’

“I’ll have my team review the feasibility of your AI proposal,” he continued, standing up and buttoning his suit jacket. “In the future, however, I expect your presentations to be as organized as your ideas are intelligent. Understood?”

“Yes, sir!” she said quickly, nodding so enthusiastically that her glasses slipped down again.

Ethan gave a single nod and gestured toward the door. “You’re dismissed.”

As Lila hurried out of the office, she couldn’t help but smile. Sure, she’d been a mess, but she’d also managed to impress him—if only a little. It was a win in her book.

Meanwhile, Ethan sat back down and opened the folder again, his lips curving into the faintest hint of a smirk. Unorganized, impulsive... but smart. He couldn’t decide whether she was an asset or a liability, but one thing was certain—Lila Rivers was not boring.

---

As Lila left his office, her heart felt lighter than it had in days. She’d survived her first week under Ethan Ford’s scrutiny—and maybe, just maybe, she’d earned a sliver of his respect.

Of course, knowing her luck, she’d probably trip on the way back to her desk.

Inside, the atmosphere was just as rigid—every step, every breath calculated for maximum efficiency. Employees whispered as they hurried down the hallways, terrified of catching the attention of the company’s legendary CEO, Ethan Aurelius Ford.

At 8:05 AM, precisely five minutes late, Lila Rivers burst through the revolving doors of the 30th floor, her tote bag threatening to give up on life. She was juggling a precarious tower of folders, her favorite neon green tumbler balanced on top.

“Okay, Lila,” she whispered to herself, her breath quickening as she passed the staring eyes of sharply dressed assistants. “You’ve got this. You’re professional. You’re capable. You’re totally not about to—”

The moment she stepped out of the elevator, fate decided otherwise.

---

Lila rounded the corner at high speed and slammed directly into what felt like a brick wall. The folders exploded from her arms like confetti. Her tumbler, ever loyal, betrayed her, spilling its caffeinated contents in a perfect arc.

“Oh no! No, no, no!” Lila gasped, scrambling to stop the avalanche of chaos.

“Careful,” came a deep, measured voice.

Lila froze, her heart pounding as she looked up. Towering over her, dressed in a charcoal gray suit, stood Ethan Ford. He radiated power, precision, and a kind of cold detachment that could freeze lava. His steel-gray eyes scanned her from head to toe, settling on the coffee stain now blooming across his chest.

“Oh my God,” Lila stammered. “I—I didn’t mean to! I wasn’t looking! And you were just standing there like a…a very tall statue!”

The office fell silent, the sound of muffled typing and distant phones replaced by an air of pure dread. Employees peeked out from behind their cubicles, waiting for the storm they knew was coming.

Ethan’s expression didn’t change. “Miss Rivers, I presume?”

“Yes! That’s me!” Lila dropped to her knees, frantically gathering papers. “Lila Rivers, new hire, department of…uh…” She blinked at the scattered documents. “Something important?”

Ethan watched her with an unreadable expression, his hands clasped behind his back. “Marketing. You’re in marketing.”

“Right! Marketing. Definitely knew that. Totally didn’t just blank because of this whole situation,” she said, gesturing wildly at the mess. “Oh, and the coffee! I am so sorry. Do you have a dry cleaner nearby? Or an extra suit? Or maybe a time machine so I can undo this? Ha! Just kidding. Not really.”

---

Ethan’s gray eyes flickered to the coffee stain, then back to her. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a handkerchief, and dabbed at the stain with the precision of a surgeon.

“It’s just coffee,” he said, his tone clipped but calm.

“Oh, thank goodness you’re not mad. I mean, I was expecting you to yell or fire me or—”

“I haven’t decided yet,” Ethan interrupted, cutting her off with a raised brow.

Lila’s eyes widened. “Oh. Right. Of course. That makes sense. I mean, if I were in your shoes, I’d probably fire me too. Not that I’m saying you should!”

Ethan sighed quietly. “Miss Rivers, do you plan to remain on the floor all day, or are you capable of standing up?”

“Oh, right! Standing! I can do that.” She shot to her feet, promptly tripping over the strap of her tote bag and colliding with a nearby desk.

Ethan’s expression remained neutral, though there was a flicker of something—amusement? Exasperation?—in his eyes.

“Follow me,” he said simply, turning on his heel.

---

As Lila followed Ethan through the sleek, minimalist office, her nerves refused to settle. She caught glimpses of the employees around her—polished, poised, and very much not spilling coffee on their CEO.

“So,” Lila began, her voice overly chipper, “what’s the company motto? You know, something inspiring like ‘Teamwork makes the dream work,’ or ‘Coffee first, business later’?”

Ethan glanced at her, his tone flat. “Efficiency and excellence. Always.”

“Yikes. No room for error, huh?”

“No.”

“Got it. Cool. Cool, cool, cool.”

They reached her desk, an immaculate workspace that was somehow already stocked with all the essentials. Lila set her bag down, silently promising herself she’d try to keep it organized.

Ethan turned to her. “Your first meeting is in one hour. Don’t be late.”

“Understood,” Lila said, saluting before realizing how unprofessional it looked. “Uh, I mean, yes, sir. Mr. Ford. Ethan? What do you prefer?”

“Mr. Ford,” he replied curtly.

“Got it, Mr. Ford!”

---

Later That Day

The conference room on the executive floor was as intimidating as the man who presided over it. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooked the city skyline, while sleek black chairs surrounded a table that gleamed under the light of a modern chandelier.

Lila entered the room clutching her laptop, a tangle of charging cords, and what appeared to be a last-minute printout of her slides. She was five minutes early, yet everyone else had already arrived, including Ethan Aurelius Ford, who sat at the head of the table, an impenetrable fortress of calm authority.

You’ve got this, Lila, she told herself, trying to steady her breath.

The meeting began with the usual formalities, but soon, all eyes turned to her.

“Miss Rivers,” Ethan said, his voice a low command, “you may proceed with your presentation.”

Lila set her laptop on the table, fumbling with the cords. “Just one second!” she chirped nervously as the screen flickered. “You know, technology these days—more temperamental than me on a Monday morning!”

Crickets.

Someone in the room coughed awkwardly. Lila winced but pressed on, finally getting her slides on the screen.

“All right,” she began, brushing back a stray curl. “So, imagine this: you’re browsing your favorite online store, and just as you’re about to buy something, bam! You get distracted. Happens all the time, right?” She paused for effect. “Well, what if our platform could send a perfectly timed nudge—let’s call it a smart reminder—that says, ‘Hey, remember that pair of shoes you liked? They’re still waiting for you!’ But not in a creepy way, obviously.”

The audience, a mix of senior executives and marketing heads, exchanged glances. Ethan remained perfectly still, watching her with an unreadable expression.

“This idea,” Lila continued, clicking to the next slide, “is called InsightSync. It uses predictive analytics to identify when users are most likely to make a purchase, delivering personalized reminders at optimal times. Think of it as...a digital shopping assistant with the psychic powers of your mom.”

Her joke earned a faint chuckle from one of the younger executives.

Encouraged, Lila went on. “But that’s not all. We’re also introducing ‘dynamic deals’—offers that change in real-time based on user activity. It’s like the stock market, but for discounts. I mean, who wouldn’t want to be a bargain broker?”

This time, no one laughed.

Lila swallowed hard, her cheeks reddening. “Right. Moving on…”

As she reached for her water bottle to wet her suddenly parched throat, her elbow bumped into her laptop, sending it teetering dangerously close to the edge of the table. “Oh no, no, no—stay!” she yelped, grabbing it just in time.

Ethan’s brow twitched, though his face remained composed.

Clearing her throat, Lila straightened. “As I was saying, InsightSync can not only increase conversion rates but also boost customer retention by 25%. And our cost-benefit analysis…” She rifled through her stack of papers, accidentally scattering half of them onto the floor.

Lila froze, biting her lip. “Well, that’s just great.” She crouched to gather the papers, muttering under her breath, “It’s fine. Totally fine. This is not the worst first day ever…”

When she finally stood, her hands full of crumpled notes, Lila took a deep breath. “Look, I know this hasn’t exactly been the smoothest presentation,” she admitted, her voice steady despite the chaos she’d just caused. “But here’s the thing: this idea works. It’s innovative, it’s backed by data, and it aligns perfectly with our target market’s habits.”

The room grew quiet. Even the executives who’d been sneaking glances at their watches were now fully engaged.

Lila’s voice grew stronger. “This isn’t just a fancy tool—it’s a game-changer. It’s the kind of innovation that makes a company stand out. So, if you’re looking for something safe and ordinary, this isn’t it. But if you want something bold and forward-thinking, InsightSync is the way to go.”

The room erupted into murmurs.

Ethan leaned forward slightly, his piercing gaze fixed on her. “Bold words,” he said, his tone low and deliberate.

Lila smiled nervously. “Well, if you’re going to spill coffee on your CEO, you might as well go big, right?”

To her shock, someone laughed—genuinely laughed. The tension in the room softened, and even Ethan’s eyes glinted with what might have been amusement.

---

After the Meeting

As the executives filed out, a few murmured polite words of encouragement. Lila let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.

“Miss Rivers,” Ethan’s voice stopped her in her tracks.

She turned to see him standing by the table, arms crossed. “Despite your…unique approach,” he said, a faint edge of sarcasm in his tone, “your idea has merit. But next time, come prepared. No excuses.”

Lila blinked, then grinned. “Got it, Mr. Ford. And next time, I’ll leave the dad jokes at home. Maybe.”

Ethan shook his head slightly but didn’t reply, already turning back to his work.

Lila left the room with a spring in her step. She might have been a walking disaster, but she was their walking disaster now—and she wasn’t going down without a fight.

Dearest Zahra,

By the time you receive this letter, I will either be on my way to the execution room or already gone.

To be honest, this is not the first draft I have written. Countless sentences have been constructed and deconstructed, many words have been written, discarded, and reshaped all in the effort to write to you, my dear.

At the end of my court martial in the military court of Algiers, I thought that when the time came to sit at the table and write to you, the words would flow naturally. I even imagined that I would ask for more paper to hold everything I wanted to say. But, last night, when one of the guardians handed me a pen and a stack of paper, I found myself unable to translate the turmoil of feelings raging within me into words.

How could anyone weave years and years of love and shared life into mere words? How could I pour everything onto a few sheets of paper and call it a goodbye letter?

For hours, I sat on my bench, surrounded by dozens of crumpled drafts scattered like fallen leaves, staring blankly at the empty pages before me. I tried beginning my letter with a description of my cell—the cold, narrow walls, and the suffocating odor of moist and closed spaces—or perhaps the court, with its endless echoes and unyielding verdicts. I even considered writing about the tiny hole in the wall that allows in a sliver of pale light.

I thought about asking how you, the kids, and _oumma_ are doing, imagining the lingering smell of fresh baked goods, the soft patters of tiny feet running around, and the warmth of your timid smile whenever our gazes met. In another draft, I began with our wedding night—how you were, your eyes lined with thick kohl, sparkling like jewels in the faint candlelight.

But none of those drafts felt right. Unlike you, words were never been my alleys. They have never come easily to me, especially when it comes to speaking of what lies beneath the “man of the house” façade I have always worn.

To tell you the truth, I did consider not writing anything at all—just leaving a simple request for you to take care of yourself, the kids, and my mother. But then, I thought of our boys and girls. Someday, they will want to have a bit of something left from their father other than a faded photograph or fragments of stories told by others.

And then there was you. The thought of leaving this world without saying goodbye to you, my wild flower, was weighing on me. It was unbearable. So here I am, beneath the pale moonlight that sneaks through the cracks in my cell, trying to tame the storm of words and emotions swirling inside me and set them down on this fragile piece of paper.

I know I promised to come back to you and the children. I promised we would raise them together in a free, independent Algeria. I know I made so many the day I joined the National Liberation Army, promises that I am now ashamed to break and not be able to keep. They say that _Rajel b kelmteh_—a man’s worth lies in the promises he keeps—but some promises, no matter how deeply felt, are not meant to be kept.

But, my beautiful, dear Zahra, I need you to know that I had never regretted joining this holy war. Not even once—not when I was arrested, nor when I was told that I would be sent to death. I did this, all of it for you and for our children. I left the comfort of our tiny home to fight for a future for Djilali, Mestafa, Fatna, Khadra, Rahmouna, Mohamed, Elamaria, and Boualem. A future that, though I won’t be here to witness it—at least not at first hand—I am certain will hold brighter days than we have ever known.

_El Istiqlal_—our liberation is near, _Incha’Allah_. Everyone is talking about it, even the French high-ranking officers. Thanks to our leader Ferhat Abbes and the diplomates, the Algerian cause has been laid bare before the whole world. Now, through everyone’s efforts, the press speaks of our cause. The world sees us and knows about our glorious war. It is only a matter of time before we claim our freedom, before we claim our land—our dear, beloved Algeria. Even the French government is aware that the end is near. With every passing day, with every breath, and every bullet, decree, and speech, we move closer.

So, hold on, my sweet, beloved flower. The day when our red, white, and green flag rises high in the sky is drawing closer.

Look at me—always unable to separate politics from my life. Here I go again, rambling endlessly about war and the country, even now when I should be saying my goodbye to you. Forgive me, my dear. I promise I won’t get distracted again.

I am now at Serkadji Prison in Algiers. I was brought here over a week ago, after my sentence was pronounced, and this is where my life will end. But my life has been blessed with all kinds of love. your love, the love of our children, my family’s love, and Algeria’s love.

The moment the general pronounced the words “death sentence”, the first thing I thought of was never being able to hear your contagious laugh again. To be honest, that thought scared me more than death itself. I thought of never sitting at the table in our crammed kitchen during those early hours of the day, sipping my coffee—I miss your coffee, by the way. The one served here is watered-down and weak—_ghir el ma w zgharit_; it can’t even compare to yours—while listening to you sing one of your favorite _Mouachahat_ as you bake bread.

I thought about never watching you untie your long, jade-black hair while sitting under the olive tree my late father planted decades ago, combing through its soft, silken strands. I thought about never feeling your breath against my skin as you helped me with my tie or trimmed my hair.

I thought about hearing you whisper my name, your voice soft and filled with love as a blush crept up your delicate neck, or hearing you murmur a prayer each time I left the house to keep the evil eye away and to protect me. The thought of not growing old with you, of not spending the rest of my life lost in your deep brown eyes, makes a part of me die before I have even taken my last breath.

Please tell Kheira Bent El Mehdi that Rachid is safe and sound. I know she worries for her son, and I have promised her that I would watch over him. Let her know that he is working tirelessly, alongside our comrades, to make our dream of a free Algeria come true. He will reach out as soon as he can.

My love, do you remember the summer nights we spent lying on that old blanket, gazing up at the night sky? I can still hear the of Al-Khayyam and Hafez you used to recite me. Sitting here in this small, humid cell, I hear your voice echoing in the dark, humming the melodies that carried me through my time away from you.

Do you remember the first time I gathered the courage to confess my feelings for you? That night, under the full moon, as my rough fingers undid your braids and ran through your hair, I felt warmth bloom in my chest.

I never understood how I became so lucky, so blessed, to call a woman like you my own. Each time I think of your soft touch and hear your warm voice in my mind, I feel like I can move mountains and defeat heavy battalions singlehandedly.

That night, as I gazed into your eyes—those eyes that bewitched my mind, body, and soul the first time I saw them—I knew that I would do anything in my power to see you smile. The moment I lifted your veil for the first time on our wedding night, I knew then that I would not only die for you, but I would live for you as well.

So, please, my love, live for me. Continue to smile, to laugh, and to savor anything life throws your way—for me. Raise our children to be the good citizens this generous land would need when we claim our independence.
Tell them about their father and his comrades. Explain to them that I am not truly gone—that I gave my life so Algeria could live. Tell them that I traded all of my tomorrow so they could get better ones.

I will always be with you—a loving memory of the man who lived and died for you. I will keep watching over you, as proud as I have always been of the incredible woman you are.

I will be up there, watching our sons and daughters build a future for themselves from the blood and ashes of our sacred war.

I will count the years, months, days, and hours until we meet again. But please, take all the time you need. I will be waiting for you, with our little ones who left this world before they even knew what it meant to be alive.

I will wait for you for as long as it takes. So please, live a happy, long, and fulfilling life. Cherish every moment of it, because when we meet again, I will want you to tell me everything.

Please, my dear flower, don’t cry when you receive this letter. Don’t mourn my death. _Zagharti w ferhi ya mra_—rejoice and celebrate with our children and loved ones. _Rajlek chahid,_ your husband is a martyr.

_Thalli fi rouhek w fi wladna_—take care of yourself and our children.

_Tahia el Djazayer hourra moustaqilla_—long live Algeria, free and independent. W yahya echouhada—and long live the martyrs.

Farewell, my love.

Always yours,

Your husband, Ali.

Imagine this: it’s the summer of 2054. We’re on the porch of a cozy house—one of those timeless places where the steps creak like old memories and the swing hums softly in the evening breeze. The sky is a canvas of gold and fire, and we’re there, painting it with laughter and shared stories. The kind of tales that weave themselves into your soul: travels that shaped us, mishaps that made us laugh, and quiet moments where no words were needed—just the warmth of each other’s company.

It’s not about grand adventures every day, but about finding magic in the ordinary—the way the sunset turns the edges of the world golden or how a shared silence can feel louder than words. Now, I’m here searching for the co-author of this future. Could it be you?

# A Little About Me

I’m a contradiction wrapped in curiosity. A writer of thoughts, a collector of sunsets, and a seeker of those fleeting moments that remind us how beautiful the world can be. Quiet at first, but if you’re patient, you’ll find someone who speaks in passions and listens like it’s the most important thing they could ever do.

Right now, I’m looking for **a friendship** that feels like the first chapter of a well-worn book—something natural, unforced, where we build a connection page by page. I believe the best stories begin with a spark of understanding, and maybe, just maybe, they grow into something more.

**Here’s what makes my story unique:**

🎵 **Music as a Muse:** Vinyl collections, road trip playlists, and songs that feel like home. Music has a way of connecting moments, and I love finding the soundtrack to life’s best memories. Got a favorite tune? Share it—I’m always ready to discover the melodies that move you.  
🌍 **Adventure in My Veins:** Whether it’s chasing the perfect golden-hour light, wandering through unfamiliar streets, or hiking trails that lead to breathtaking views, I’m all about exploring the world—both near and far. Life’s too short not to follow the whispers of adventure.  
📚 **Wordsmith at Heart:** Writing is my way of capturing the fleeting and the unforgettable. I love playing with words until they reflect the emotions I can’t quite say aloud. And recently, I’ve been dabbling in photography—turning moments into memories through a lens.  
🕹️ **Low-Key Gamer:** When the world feels too loud, there’s something comforting about a quiet night in with a good game or a classic movie marathon.

# What Sets Me Apart

I see life as a tapestry of little details: the way sunlight dances on leaves, the rhythm of rain on a quiet afternoon, or the poetry of a shared moment that feels too good to end. I’ll notice the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love, and I’ll make a mental note of your favorite coffee order—not because I have to, but because I want to.

Loyalty is my cornerstone. I’ll show up, not just in the big moments, but in the small ones too—the random text when I know you’re having a rough day, the laughter when you need a distraction, or simply being there when you feel like the world isn’t. The best stories aren’t about grand gestures; they’re about the quiet consistency of someone who’s truly there for you.

I’m also a romantic—not in the cliché way, but in the way that makes you feel seen. Sweet gestures, thoughtful words, and a knack for making everyday moments feel special. I’m the kind of person who’ll leave you a note in your favorite book, point out constellations during a midnight drive, or turn a casual Sunday into something unforgettable.

And when it comes to connection, I value honesty above all. If something’s on your mind, I’ll always want to hear it. Because real stories—the ones worth telling—are built on truth, not games.

# What About You?

Are you the kind of person who finds beauty in the cracks of everyday life? Who laughs easily, dreams deeply, and values honesty like a rare gem? Maybe you’re someone who savors both the quiet moments and the spontaneous ones—a cozy evening in or a bold adventure out.

Let’s start as friends, as kindred spirits who share an appreciation for the world’s quirks and wonders. Maybe we’ll swap stories, exchange playlists, or even embark on an adventure or two. And if the story decides to write itself into something more, we’ll let it—after all, the best tales often begin with an unexpected chapter.

If this resonates, let’s start the first line of what could be an unforgettable story. One filled with porch swings, golden sunsets, and the kind of connection that makes you believe in the magic of “what if.” Let’s see where the words take us.",2,1732319105.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

What else can I do?,"TDLR I have a friend who I think I really like, and I think they really like me, but they keep saying we shouldn’t hookup, even though they’ve said they want to. It seems like they’re scared of ruining our friendship, but I’m too stressed about this and I need clarity but talking to them directly kinda just made things more confusing. Is there anything else I can do? Is asking them out on a date the wrong move if it might scare them away?

I have this friend who I’ve know for like 4 years, mainly through class and work, I invited them to my dnd campaign 2 years ago because I know my tendency to forget people exist if I don’t see them often and I didn’t want to do that. Last spring semester, they started making a more active effort to spend one on one time with me, getting coffee, studying together, then they invited me to join their existing dnd campaign.

By the end of the semester, they ended up spontaneously sleeping on my couch for the night and we spent like 32 straight hours together just chatting and playing card. I tend to get very socially burnt out very quickly, but I had a lovely time with them, I honestly didn’t want them to leave.

Cut to this fall semester and I’m really not sure how I feel about them. I like spending time with them and I have a desire to be more physically intimate, but I’m really bad at being forward. I ended up asking them on 2 quasi dates, although we didn’t call them dates, and after the second they came back to my house to watch a movie with me.

Apparently a mutual friend of ours had convinced my friend to talk to me about how they were feeling about me and we had a little heart to heart. But the thing is, we’re both so confused about how we’re feeling that nothing was really clarified. They said they also really like spending time with me but they’re also not sure how they feel. Apparently their therapist had convinced them to make a list of friends they wouldn’t try to fuck and apparently I was at the top of that last. They said it was because they didn't want to fuck up our friendship by introducing sex, but they also said they’ve always thought I was really hot. But they've made jokes about us hooking up before, and when I told them I was too scared to be forward, they I told me they would have said yes if I has asked. But the conversation ended with “this relationship feels very amorphous rn and that’s distressing, and we don’t know if we want to try dating or hooking up.” 

We just cuddled each other and talked, it was incredibly intimate and lovely. They kept laughing and saying “what are we doing” and we just giggled. They said we probably shouldn’t have sex and I said there was no pressure to, then they said “well now I want to cause you’re being a gentlemen about it.” I didn’t really know how to handle that, I just said I’d hold them to what they said first and that we shouldn’t have sex.

We’ve hung out a couple times since then, mainly in group settings and we watched another movie and cuddled, but again nothing happened. I don’t want to scare them by asking them on a real date, but I keep thinking about them throughout the day and panicking cause I don’t know what I’m doing, and I feel like the only way to fix that is to get some clarity on what we’re doing. I want to just ask them how they feel, but it's not like they had a clear answer a month ago last time we talked about it. And I don’t want to tell them how distressing this all is for me, cause I feel like that will end up pressuring them one way or another, it feels like guilt tripping and I would hate to do that to them.

I’ve only really had one serious relationship before that ended poorly, while they have had quite a few more, and they’re poly and fairly promiscuous. They ended up being late to hang out with me one time because they were hooking up with someone, and that was the first time I’ve ever really felt jealous of anyone in that way. It's not like I want to be the only one getting their attention, I'm poly too and I just want them to be happy, I’m hooking up with other folks too, but it’s just so confusing how they're so sex positive but still scared that sex will ruin our relationship.

I just don’t know what to do, has anyone had any similar experiences? I know we're both young and figuring life out and I really like them, but is it worth it being this stressed over one person? I rarely feel this strongly about people and it's really confusing. Is there anything else I can do? Is asking them out on a date the wrong move if it might scare them away? Would asking them how they feel about me again after only a month be bad?",1,1732318996.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Some of us from the same university decided to go out for a drink, some people i already hanged out with and a girl I havent met before. I was late and others already found their seat at the coffee shop, so when i arrived I sat next to the new girl. As soon as she saw me, she became so flustered and started fixing everything on her (hair, clothes...). We both knew what was going on, throughout the whole night she was flirting but in a cute innocent way, and every time i looked at her she smiled like she was the happiest person alive. Im gonna sound terrible right now, but her and me are both extremely beautiful and both are one of those who dont have any problems at studies, we have similar interests, it feels so right and she was overjoyed that night every time i talked to her, most of the talking was me teasing her and overall just laughing with her. Just a quick detail, she even was down for me feeding her an Oreo from my hand even though we met just an hour ago, i didnt do it tho, sad i know.

Okay to recap, we both had a great fun night together where we fell for each other, it just feels so right, but then stupid ME happened.

She goes to the same university as me so it is natural we will see each other right away.

I have never dated before, not because i didnt have options but because im afraid to experience first love with a wrong person, i cant relax and stop thinking if she is really who she presents herself to be, and that seems to be the case now. Overthinking me who is currently dying from the most intense crush i have ever felt, decided to avoid her and ignore her for a week at university. She tried to come close to me, her eyes were looking for me where ever i was, in the hallways, classroom... When i was passing near her yesterday, i just looked at her and she showed me the most innocent smile filled with joy, i smiled back and walked by while holding such a pain in my heart.

Crush should feel amazing and make your world feel colorful, it kinda does, but i feel more pain that doesnt let go, never ending feeling in my heart that is tearing me apart. My favorite part of the day started being lifting weights and feeling physical pain, im bringing myself to the absolute edge of exhaustion because i dont know what to do anymore. I definitely cant just forget her.

Now its the weekend and i wont be seeing her for three days, my heart hasnt stop hurting for a week, i cant sleep and im just thinking of that night where everything felt so right, like she is the one i have been waiting for, yet i cant bring myself to talk to her, not because im shy, but because im not sure should i let my defenses down and make myself vulnerable for a chance at first love. I act like i dont care and that night wasnt a big deal. In reality im killing myself with overthinking that she might lose feelings for me because already a week has passed since that night. I dont know how girls think, how long do girls hold their crushes, it has been a week and all i want is to see her, but does that mean she will want to see me next week. I can talk to her, i just dont know if i should. I went back to read this and even i dont know what is the point, what am i even asking, im saying all i want is to see her, but im doing the opposite.

Will her feelings fade after a week of me not talking?

I feel like i could tell her anything and we would naturally start dating, but im afraid she will break my heart when she finally gets me.",1,1732318773.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

House music is like a well-balanced smoothie bowl - a steady four-on-the-floor beat (the smoothie base) topped with various layers of melodies and vocals (like colorful fruits, granola, and honey). Deep House would be a darker açai base, while Tropical House adds lighter, sweeter elements like mango and coconut.

Dubstep is molecular gastronomy gone wild - those aggressive ""wub"" bass drops are like explosive liquid nitrogen desserts or popping candy. The intricate sound design is similar to deconstructed dishes that transform familiar ingredients into alien textures. Imagine a dish that literally changes form as you eat it.

Techno is like dark chocolate espresso - pure, minimalist, and intense. Berlin-style techno is even more bitter and stripped down, like a single-origin coffee served black. The repetitive nature is like the consistent, methodical process of pulling the perfect espresso shot.

Trance is a layered parfait that builds and builds - starting with a simple base and gradually adding layers until reaching a euphoric peak, like layers of cream, fruit, and meringue creating a towering dessert. The breakdown is like reaching the center of the parfait, stripping away layers before building back up.

Future Bass is like a cotton candy frappuccino - sweet, colorful, and full of synthetic textures. Those wobbling synths are like flavored syrups and whipped cream, creating something unabashedly artificial but deliciously satisfying.

Hardstyle is wasabi mixed with ghost peppers - intense, aggressive, and not for the faint of heart. Those distorted kicks are like powerful spice hits that dominate your senses, while the melodies provide moments of sweet relief.

Ambient is like molecular gastronomy's air dishes - ethereal, atmospheric, barely there but still captivating. Think flavored foams, edible mists, and aromatic clouds that create an experience more than a traditional meal.

Big Room EDM is like an over-the-top dessert challenge at a restaurant - massive, designed for spectacle, with huge buildups leading to excessive drops. It's the equivalent of those giant sundaes with sparklers, designed to turn heads at every table.

Minimal Techno is like a deconstructed sushi plate - stripped down to essential elements, each sound carefully placed like individual pieces of fish, where subtle variations and negative space are just as important as the ingredients themselves.

1gxlnlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gxlnlr/help/,HELP! 😬,"Long story as short as possible. I’m a late 20s attractive male that receives quite a bit of attention from females. I’ve always been in tune with energy and when a female is attracted to me and have never been wrong.

I’ve been going to this coffee shop by my work for a few months now and saw this girl who is quite simply the most attractive woman I’ve ever seen. It was love at first sight for me but she had never served me and I never spoke to her or even looked at her apart from the first time I went to this shop. 

However the last couple weeks I’ve seen her in the shop everyday and we spoke properly for the first time, just general chat, but I got a certain vibe with her tone. 

The next day I go in again and she asks me to remind her of my name (I’ve never really said it to her directly before) and I ask for hers and say it’s nice to properly meet you. This was her just doing her job but by her tone and body language it wasn’t just her doing her job if that makes sense.

Next day I’m in again, this time in the queue paying no attention to her but I can see her in my peripheral vision, she’s seen me, turns away from the queue and starts adjusting herself in the reflection of the counter and then continues to look at me, I smile to myself of course.  I get my coffee we don’t speak or make eye contact (this is my doing on purpose).

Again the day after I go back in to get my order we don’t say anything to each other avoiding eye contact until I leave. She’s staring at me I stare at her we share a mutual smile, but the way she looked at me was like she was looking into my soul. This happens again the next day. Same look, watching me as I’m walking out, same smile, all very flirty and alluring, I can sense something.

The next day I notice she’s changed her hair there’s a huge queue as I’m walking out and she’s serving the people, she stops serving the whole queue to look at me as I’m walking out and goes how are you? I say I’m good, I love the new look by the way and walk out.

Then later that day i bump into her whilst having my lunch and spill my coffee everywhere she starts laughing and gives me the same alluring eyes she’s been giving me the last few days. I laugh and walk off, she laughs and rolls her eyes no conversation as I was in a rush. But again vibe and energy all there.

Next day I go into to collect my order again no words spoken no eye contact made whilst in the shop but as soon as I walk out she’s looking at me giving me those same eyes and smile. 5-6 days in a row of this. Minimal convo, all just eye fucking essentially. Later that evening I finish work and I’m crossing the road and she’s there trying to turn at a junction, she beeps her horn and waves at me and drives off. As she’s driving off I can see she’s looking at me in her rear view mirror. I smile. I don’t think you would beep and wave at a random customer you barely know.

Next day I go into the coffee shop again this time we make eye contact and smile whilst I’m waiting for my order this time, then as I arrive back to my car I decide to turn around to see if she’s looking and there she is with her colleague both looking and laughing.

This all obviously feels amazing and I can tell by her body language, her smile, her eyes she finds me attractive just as I have done with many women prior to her. Energy never lies . Now here’s when things get confusing.

I decide to type her name into IG and funnily enough we have mutuals. Her accounts open, mine is private. She looks incredible and it reaffirms my feelings towards her she’s truly the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. But I’ve seen through the highlights that she has a bf. 

I go into the coffee shop the next couple of days, she doesn’t look at me at all when I’m in the shop or walking out. I can feel an energy shift.

Is it because I’ve found her on ig and not added her but viewed her highlights? 

Anyways the point of this post is the fact she’s ignored the last two days has made me actually want to talk to her more despite knowing she’s got a bf. I’ve kept it super casual not tried to converse, not made eye contact as much as possible until im out of the shop. 

The reality is I want her. However the change in energy has thrown me off. I don’t want to add her randomly on ig as I think that’s weird especially considering I now know she’s got a boyfriend. I want to speak to her before doing any of that.

Is she into me? Was she into me? The later I have no doubts. I’m just struggling to know what’s changed and it’s driving me crazy. Should I add her on ig and see if she adds me back? I don’t want to chat to her whilst she’s working as that’s embarrassing for her. But right now, I want to pursue her and I can’t put into words the actual feeling of the energy I sensed between us despite minimal convo, the eyes said everything. But why the energy shift?  I know she felt it too.

Someone help it’s driving me in fucking sane!

Not my story. Original post is linked at the end. 

————

The cocaine turkeys of Brighton/Brookline

Background:I managed a convenience store off the B line in Brighton for five years.

   At some point during this job I was roped into working Sunday morning shifts. Every Sunday morning there was a tiny old lady who would come in and sit on a alcove by the front window and read every newspaper. She was sweet and fragile and never did anything even slightly untoward.
   Often times she would sit there quietly and wouldn’t do more than by coffee, but on the rare occasion she’d go off on a tangent and keep talking about something dreadfully boring, leaving me no escape for my hungover ears.
   One morning, however, a group of turkeys took a little morning stroll on the sidewalk outside of the store window, as is not uncommon as they can be a huge nuisance in Brookline/Brighton. Thus begins the old lady’s dialogue:

Her: “those dammed cocaine turkeys”

Me: -head perking up from a half slumber-: “excuse me? What was that?”

Her: “those dammed cocaine turkeys! Been here ever since the 80’s”

Me: “what do you mean?”

Her: “in the 80’s there was a large turkey farm in Brighton. It’s all new construction now, but back then it was a big business! One day the police raided the farm to find that the company had been using turkey carcasses to hide big bricks of cocaine inside and sell.
   The owners and all the workers were arrested and the farm was left to close down, the turkeys still free to roam. Eventually the turkeys started getting out and wandering the streets, eating anything they could find. That’s where all these turkeys come from!”

I still have no idea if this story is true, but I’ve avoided fact checking it because I like to believe this possibly senile lady, and the unusually interesting Sunday morning she gave me that day.

EDIT: Damn two golds and so many others! You guys are great…. I’ve been sick in bed all day and this post helped keep me sane with all the love and attention! Submit your cocaine turkey designs and I will make a t-shirt!

41/F. On no birth control or other prescribed medication. I do take supplements. I am sure I’ve posted here before about the same problem - constantly breaking out in whiteheads and sometimes actual pimples all over my face. I only occasionally have clear skin and two times that I remember was on vacation. Most recently in October I was gone for 2 weeks, using this same routine (not everything pictured - just the retinal, milky toner, face wash and moisturizer/sunscreen) in another country and my skin was PERFECT.  After coming back my skin freaked OUT. I was on my period during it but ended before I returned. 

Anyway, I’m sitting here bawling right now as I have completely given up. I surrender. I am absolutely done constantly fighting with my skin. I am still breaking out weeks later and I’m not even on my period - I believe I am ovulating.

Doing a routine doesn’t help. Doing nothing doesn’t help. Not touching my face doesn’t help. I do admit I relapsed in picking recently and I feel like that made it worse. I am trying to be better. I change my pillow case every two days. I use fragrance free laundry detergent - doesn’t work.

I have a feeling it’s my apartment’s hard water but I am not in a position to go messing with my shower head and get a filter. Using bottled water feels wasteful to me and I end up going through an entire bottle just washing my face.

My diet is a mix of healthy and unhealthy, I try to keep it balanced as much as possible. I do eat dairy but trying to cut back and I use oat milk creamer in coffee.

I take a multivitamin, vitamin d, ashwagandha and magnesium glycinate. I use whey protein powder in my protein shakes. 

I am going insane trying to figure out what is happening. I don’t feel beautiful and I’m afraid to show my face in public - even still I can feel people looking at me and judging me. 
 
Products not shown Magic Molecule HOCL spray, The Ordinary cream cleanser, the newer one (can’t remember what it’s called)

I don’t use everything daily - I would do the retinal 3x a week and the milky toner the day after and just moisturizer the day after that. Spot treatment if I have a bad breakout, HOCL spray on clean skin after a workout. I have a feeling maybe that’s what’s causing this, I have no idea. Been using the retinal since September and the milky toner since June. Cleanser since September and I just switched to the cream moisturizer by curology for the dryer months, was just using the regular lighter one in summer. 

I’m about ready to throw everything away and start fresh.  I can’t do this anymore.

I didn't realize my hearing had deteriorated further, was again at a point were I was asking people to repeat themselves more than once, and of course the arguments with your spouse. The last time I had my hearing checked by an Audiologist was when I bought the HA's I was wearing. I didn't want to spend big $$$ on new ones, but OTC's didn't work as well. I was talked into making a hearing appointment.  

I made an appointment with an Audiologist, the last one I went to was retired, but took a chance based on the online reviews. I took my HA's, which I thought worked just fine, which he called analog antiques. I remember buying them, most were digital or going digital, but I had a family to feed, keep a roof over their heads, so I opted for cheapest ones, an analog pair. He looked at them, one of them appeared it was working, but the mic was dead. He gave me a battery of hearing tests, first time I haven't sat in a booth and pressed the button when you hear the sound. I was amazed at how many different tests there were, took a little over an hour. Since the old HA's couldn't be fixed, we spent about 30 minutes going over the various manufacturers, types, colors, batteries or rechargeable, my head was spinning, now to decide which ones. I ordered some Phonak Audeo L90's. I don't have insurance that covers HA's or the test, they are expensive, more than the down payment on my first house, more than my first car.  

They finally arrived, scheduled my fitting. The fitting was yesterday morning, took as long as the hearing test did, learned they now do a REM test, some additional tweaking, explain all the functions, the app, warranty, and the trial period. When I put them in for the first time, they were turned on, I was beside myself. I don't remember being this overwhelmed the first time. I could hear sounds I couldn't remember hearing before, it was like the first day in a new school. Did I mention how tiny these are? I walked out, sat in my truck with the window down, taking in all the sound, I almost cried it was that overwhelming. I am not sure if it is the technology in the digital age, the advances in HA's, and wow, the clarity, bluetooth connections, an app where you can create or tweak programs, easy cleaning, and create your own program, and I am still awestruck. I sat out on the patio this morning drinking a cup of coffee, usually I catch up on the news, but this morning I just sat and listened to the birds, the wind, and all the noise I forgot exist.  

I have a followup in a month, I have now vowed to get my hearing checked regularly.     ",13,1732318289.0,HearingAids,2,1.0,False

I'd like to hear any other stories you have of Kdenlive doing good in the world, since this is technically a discussion post.

I have a friend who's in school for an education degree, and he has lots of difficulty with his assignments for two reasons 1) he's not an english speaker, and 2) he has some intellectual disabilities. One assignment for the end of the semester was a video interview project, which he recorded on his computer, a very old MacBook Air which his older sibling had somehow installed Catalina on. Recording the interview into QuickTime was the most convenient option.

But it had some serious drawbacks: the soundcard on the old laptop is busted, and quicktime doesn't even open A/V files unless it has a functioning audio output. No idea why, very frustrating. In addition, QuickTime only exports videos as .movs and can only export audio as m4a, which don't play well with other softwares. Lastly, during the leapfrog from supported OS to Catalina (unsupported on the hardware), the Apple technician had removed iMovie, the simplest software to edit a video. My friend thus went to Canva as a free editor.

Now, I don't know if any of you have tried to use Canva, but it sucks. It markets itself as freeware to people with no experience doing graphic design or AV editing, but there are serious limitations to any platform that only runs out of a browser tab. By uploading the .mov to Canva, the audio was scrambled entirely and became chopped and screwed dial-up noises. Secondly, there's a hard paywall on many of the most useful functionalities, like version history and collaboration. He lost all his progress while trying to figure out how to solve the garbled audio.

I ran into him yesterday at lunch, and he asked if I could solve the audio problems. I used to be a Mac guy, so I realised that the simplest way would be to split the original mov into separate video and audio files, then edit them together in Kdenlive. Thank god for Kdenlive keeping the older versions of their software builds up on the internet, because we found a compatible version that worked! We had to transcode the audio and video files in the command line with ffmpeg, which miraculously worked right out the box too!

But here's the best part. I was worried that if I showed him kdenlive he might get overwhelmed and I would have to basically edit the whole thing for him. But no! I went to get make some coffee for us, and when I came back he was actually experimenting with the different buttons and options in Kdenlive. All I had to do was sit back and look up how to guides for the specific questions he had, but he was able to finish his editing within 2 hours. He even found out some shortcuts I wasn't aware of!

I could tell that he really needed the ego boost of making his project from beginning to end without any technological barriers. I've been around mentally disabled people for periods of my life, and one thing which does a lot of good for their self-esteem is to see their work actually have an effect. There's an oft-repeated paradigm that Linux and FOSS software aren't as accessible to people with disabilities, but in this case the opposite was true. Corporate owned and supported software was buggy, hard to use, and frustrating. Free as in freedom software got the job done, and now my friend has another skill to put on his resumé. And he did it all on his own!

Big thanks to the devs at Kdenlive and ffmpeg. You people rule!

tl;dr: using kdenlive and ffmpeg solved an insoluble problem for a friend with disabilities. Free software enables the end-user, whatever their ability, to work more effectively and with fewer frustrations!",5,1732318066.0,kdenlive,3,1.0,False
1gxlixa,https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/comments/1gxlixa/can_caffeineenergy_drinks_cause_anhedonia/,Can caffeine/energy drinks cause anhedonia?,"I think a lot of people chug energy drinks and coffee and forget caffeine is a stimulant. It's nowhere near as strong as some of the drugs people talk about on here inducing their anhedonia but I definitely feel like it's strong enough to cause it when consumed on a regular basis.

When drinking monster energy after a prolonged break caffeine break, I feel energised, motivated and  even social. However after months of drinking one or two a day, this effect fades and there is no motivation or even buzz, it's just nothing. Everything is numb and bland.

1gxldgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/foss/comments/1gxldgc/a_story_foss_means_accessible_for_people_with/,A story: FOSS means Accessible for people with Disabilities!,"This is just a little anecdote I wanted to share about how the free and open-source philosophy is great for people with disabilities. 

I had a friend who's in school for an education degree, and he has lots of difficulty with his assignments for two reasons 1) he's not an english speaker, and 2) he has some intellectual disabilities. One assignment for the end of the semester was a video interview project, which he recorded on his computer, a very old MacBook Air which his older sibling had somehow installed Catalina on. Recording the interview into QuickTime was the most convenient option. 

But it had some serious drawbacks: the soundcard on the old laptop is busted, and quicktime doesn't even open A/V files unless it has a functioning audio output. No idea why, very frustrating. In addition, QuickTime only exports videos as .movs and can only export audio as m4a, which don't play well with other softwares. Lastly, during the leapfrog from supported OS to Catalina (unsupported on the hardware), the Apple technician had removed iMovie, the simplest software to edit a video. My friend thus went to Canva as a free editor. 

Now, I don't know if any of you have tried to use Canva, but it sucks. It markets itself as freeware to people with no experience doing graphic design or AV editing, but there are serious limitations to any platform that only runs out of a browser tab. By uploading the .mov to Canva, the audio was scrambled entirely and became chopped and screwed dial-up noises. Secondly, there's a hard paywall on many of the most useful functionalities, like version history and collaboration. He lost all his progress while trying to figure out how to solve the garbled audio. 

I ran into him yesterday at lunch, and he asked if I could solve the audio problems. I used to be a Mac guy, so I realised that the simplest way would be to split the original mov into separate video and audio files, then edit them together in Kdenlive. Thank god for Kdenlive keeping the older versions of their software builds up on the internet, because we found a compatible version that worked! We had to transcode the audio and video files in the command line with ffmpeg, which miraculously worked right out the box too! 

But here's the best part. I was worried that if I showed him kdenlive he might get overwhelmed and I would have to basically edit the whole thing for him. But no! I went to get make some coffee for us, and when I came back he was actually experimenting with the different buttons and options in Kdenlive. All I had to do was sit back and look up how to guides for the specific questions he had, but he was able to finish his editing within 2 hours. He even found out some shortcuts I wasn't aware of! 

I could tell that he really needed the ego boost of making his project from beginning to end without any technological barriers. I've been around mentally disabled people for periods of my life, and one thing which does a lot of good for their self-esteem is to see their work actually have an effect. There's an oft-repeated paradigm that Linux and FOSS software aren't as accessible to people with disabilities, but in this case the opposite was true. Corporate owned and supported software was buggy, hard to use, and frustrating. Free as in freedom software got the job done, and now my friend has another skill to put on his resumé. And he did it all on his own!

Big thanks to the devs at Kdenlive and ffmpeg. You people rule!

tl;dr: using kdenlive and ffmpeg solved an insoluble problem for a friend with disabilities. Free software enables the end-user, whatever their ability, to work more effectively and with fewer frustrations!",4,1732317637.0,foss,0,1.0,False

1gxla3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1gxla3i/need_some_help_and_advice_regarding_symptoms/,Need some help and advice regarding symptoms ,"So for the past couple of months I’ve been dealing with some weird food issues, which got so bad I had to take a month and a half off work to try to sort it out. 
Back in September I started developing panic attacks after eating, mainly because I thought my mouth was getting itchy and my throat felt weird and I would full blown panic. This first episode was after eating avocado, which I’ve had an allergy test for and I’m not allergic. But several days after my initial panic attack I developed severe chest pain and went to the ER for it. Everything came back fine. After that for about a month I had a hard time eating most foods because the level of anxiety I would get after. I also had daily severe chest pain. My doctor thought it was GERD and prescribed meds which I didn’t initially take, I also got an echo stress test to rule out heart issues and that came back fine. Fast forward to this month, I did start taking the med for GERD as needed and it had completely taken away the chest pain and when it come back I take the med again and then I’m okay for a week or so. But the itchy mouth has not stopped. When I’m at home eating in a controlled environment and having my “safe foods” this doesn’t happen at all. But the second I eat out it basically happens every single meal. For example I’m on a work trip right now and I make my breakfast in the hotel room every morning and I’m fine, I get coffee from down stairs in the lobby and I’m fine. But we ate out for lunch and I had a coffee and my mouth and throat were completely itchy. And chicken and rice from a restaurant makes me get itchy mouth but not when I make it at home. 

Additionally I have gotten hives 4 times in the past 2 months but all after eating at home, never after eating out. When I’m at home I religiously eat the same safe food, so the hives don’t make a lot of sense and seemingly aren’t even related to something I ate? Also worth noting hives is not common at all for me, I’ve maybe gotten a hive or 2 a couple times in my entire life. These hive were all over my knee caps, wrist and knuckles. 

I have appointments when an allergist next month and a GI doc in January. I’m not sure what to even say to the allergist, I feel like I’m going to sound like “a girl with anxiety”. Yes I have anxiety but it’s all related to these sensations I’m feeling (itchy throat, hives, chest pain) and I’m not even sure what food to be tested for because it seems like sometimes I’m fine with something and sometimes I’m not? (Like hotel lobby coffee vs coffee from the coffee shop) 

If anyone has thoughts on what I’m going through or could point me in a certain direction or educate me on anything that would help me understand what’s happening I would be so grateful. I’m tired of eating and getting anxious instantly and having an itchy throat and being worried something bad is going to happen to me. ",2,1732317392.0,FoodAllergies,2,1.0,False

1gxl75t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1gxl75t/unrequited_feelings/,Unrequited Feelings,"I want some unbiased opinions on whether or not you all think my crush likes me back. 
I’m convinced he does not-but I’m always a glass half empty kind of gal.

I (f22) am in a friend group at our job. I recently left my no-good ex, and I’m trying to find my own place. 

I’ve started to gain feelings for someone (M18) who recently started working with us, and joined our friend group. He is literally everything I could ever want. He cooks, bakes, kind, caring, loves animals, and a gentleman.  I’m the youngest girl, he’s the youngest guy. 

We recently started talking on snap. It’s been very good conversation. A few days into talking my birthday was coming up, so I drove to my hometown on PTO. In the middle of chatting he mentions their schedules all lined up and we were doing a hangout (he’s hosting), that I’ve been DYING to go to. I said I wanted to go, but I didn’t have a place to crash, so he offered his spare room.

I drove, we all had a great time. By 4 everyone had left, as we all have a work meeting at 6. After all friends left, crush’s brother came out and sat with us on the couch. It’s L shaped, and there’s a beanbag in the corner of the room the couch faces. I was in the couch corner, brother was on one end of the L, and crush was on the chair. Brother ended up leaving about a half an hour in, and crush got off the chair to sit on the couch. There was one cushion between us that his dog was sitting in. We chatted for a good hour until his alarm for the meeting goes off. I explained that I was on the fence about going, since I was on PTO. He asked if I wanted to ride his motorcycle to the meeting, which I happily obliged. He made us coffee, and we were off. 

After the meeting he was supposed to work, but decided to go in an hour late and feign innocence so he could give me a ride to get my stuff. On the way back I feel like he was totally showing off. He hit 80 in a 45 at one point. I felt ALIVE clinging to his back. 

We got my stuff, have a brief hug, and I was on my way back home.

I had one day off left on PTO and couldn’t figure out what to do with myself. He offered to hang out. I agreed, and picked him up the next morning. We ended up going on a trail overviewing a river (pic if it’ll upload), and stopped at a bench and enjoyed ourselves for at least 2 hours. Then we went and got lunch (my tummy was growling), and ice cream. We decided we were going to another friends place at 5, so we had time to kill. We decided to go to the property I stay at and shoot my handgun he found in my car.

After getting to the property, he said hi to my animals, we headed down the driveway. All of a sudden my phone rings, it’s my ex letting me know he’s at the property and feeding the animals for me. It went over well. Ex brought his guns out and him and crush took turns shooting.

Crush and I leave for the friends house soon after. We swing by his place so he can ride his bike, and we have a good time with friends.

I let them know I’m leaving, and he gets up to go with me. I get in my car, he’s warming up his bike, and I get some courage, get out of the car, and crack a joke saying ‘I bought you lunch, the least you can do is give me a hug’

I was expecting a half assed loose hug. He gets off the bike (helmet and gloves still on) he leans down and wraps me in a BEAR hug. I loosened my grip multiple times to give him the chance to let go, he didn’t falter. I ended up tearing up, grabbed his jacket, and said ‘you know I really care about you, right’ he said ‘I really care about you too’

We said goodbye, and he flew off on his bike.

Here’s my doubts. I don’t see him always  wanting to be around me, like how crushes gravitate to their crush. He also does not look at me a ton. Our conversations always start with me sending a streak, since I’m up early, and the conversation flows throughout the day. He does not text me out of the blue much, if at all. Please note, he does have a significant mental disorder, along with other things. I don’t know if his brain ticks in a normal sense. 

He also knows I like him. Our friend group isn’t exactly subtle when they’re drunk. He would have to be as dense as a brick to not know. Why would he hug me like that if there weren’t some kind of feelings? Was it pity? I don’t know anymore. Also apparently as of right before we started talking he has feelings for someone in his home town. Someone he hasn’t seen in years, and isn’t actively speaking to, to my knowledge. 

HELP. I feel like he’s in limbo trying to sort his feelings out. Do yall think I have a chance? I can post more info but it’s already long enough.",1,1732317183.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I know everyone likes gift cards but these are all women from different age groups that I bet like different places. I really don’t want to waste money on like a coffee gift card and find out they don’t even drink coffee. I asked on ECE day what they like and they were just kind and said anything is appreciated.

Someone suggested to me to do like a mini “gift card tree” with gift cards to a bunch of different places with a note to pick what they like but be sure to share. Is this a terrible idea?

My name is Joe. I’m 28 years old and 5’6.

I love powerlifting, going out, socializing, yoga, eating healthy, reading, and frozen/ iced coffee (even in a blizzard). I’m also a gamer with my own custom built PC.

My special skill is making a killer pasta sauce. Currently 3-0 in my semi competitive kickball league (not that anyone is keeping track or anything 😂)

1gxl5a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1gxl5a1/any_of_you_isolatedliving_far_away_from_your/,"Any of you isolated/living far away from your hometown/family/support system but live very close to JNMIL/JNILs (minutes away) with toxic enmeshment issues (or worse) and scared to divorce or leave because you're afraid you'll be brought back, stuck in JNMIL gets them?","Husband started taking up for us .. and at least moderately enforcing boundaries after years in marriage therapy.. Recently had a terrible trauma.. I HIGHLY suspect he has neuropsych issues and he like TURNED on me.. it has been HORRID and weird and makes NO sense and it isn't who he is at all.. He's paranoid, combative, hostile and I've been slipping detox supplements into green juice for him for 5 months now.. He's ABOUT halfway better but I still cannot speak to him .. It's like he regressed to a wounded child.. 

I don't get it.. he has abandonment and abuse issues due to his mom but her/the father are the only people that his issues don't seem to extend to.. He had a hepatic encephalopathy event in March.. and we lost everything to toxic mold in May.. He was FINE.. even through the trauma.. then just did a 180 one day. I did read detoxing from toxic mold flares the heck out of the brain and I had horrific depression/dissociation for a solid 3 months or so before I felt normal so I'm sure that comes into play.

I keep trying to keep the faith but I'm scared.. I'm alone out here in the northeast and my entire family is in the southwest.. No car.. no job (although I do sales and I'm starting SLOWLY online part time while kids are home).. and I keep trying to pray and realize he is about halfway better but ONLY when his mom is NEVER mentioned.. he goes insane over her.. it's like he's totally against me suddenly as the wife and in this stupor.. but he functions well in front of others.. I am not saying this to speak poorly of my husband.. I know there has to AT LEAST be something going on on a neuropsych/physical level but since paranoid JNMIL got into his ear.. he won't even see a doctor.. I'm falling apart juggling 3 kids.. 2 with AuDHD.. NYC is rough.. I get seasonal depression. I am BARELY hanging on mentally..

I'm starting to get autoimmune flags on my labs from the stress.. and I'm terrified to leave with my 3 kids back home to California.. I'm trying SO hard to hold out but he has put me through hell and it's weird because it's not HIM.. He was SO sweet, adoring, kind and we were such a united front until this trauma and literally NO trigger.. no nothing..he woke up one day acting weird.. disorganized thought pattern.. slurred speech (nope no drugs or anything).. and emotionally numb..

I feel TREMENDOUS guilt for having to consider possibly leaving him knowing he is NOT mentally well and this is above him.. But he won't get help and has a nutcase mother who raised him with a SEVERE stigma of mental health and SEVERE medical paranoia (interesting bc she's a dentist from south america)

I am keeping my kids with me but she's trying HARD to get access to them and with my husband in his mental state he seems to want to appease her and hand my kids over alone to her.. He's pressing about discussing things in counseling but not to understand me but bc he is NOT mentally well and reverting to this whole shame/guilt thing where he has to appease his mom.. It's SO weird and not reflective at all of the progress we had made in the last few years.. 

I don't usually see this scenario.. where there's some neuropsych issues.. I feel like I must have done something horrible in a past life to live this. Either way.. I stuck around and was drug through the mud knowing he isn't well and doesn't realize his family is stirring the pot and making things worse.. but he's still doing bizarre things NOT like his character at all.. he called his dad and deleted the call.. like it doesn't make sense he'd hide a call to his dad.. I feel HORRIBLE .. this is not my husband.. it's like he developed a mental illness overnight but I don't know how much I can do this..

I'd probably stay and tough it out with just him but my nerves are shot with his parents in the background and being forced to carry on kindly with people who backstabbed me and a JNMIL who routinely is nasty to me .. ZERO consequences for her.. and my husband is not mentally well enough or at his baseline to smell the coffee and be united with me like we were just months back..

I feel like it's a ticking time bomb waiting to explode and I'm practically being forced out of here with my kids but I am TERRIFIED.. I CANNOT risk 50/50.. or even just getting stuck here in NY for life.. 

I want to leave under the guise of ""WE are still married.. I'm not leaving you.. I cannot be here.. work on yourself and let me know when you're ready to work this out and reunite.."" .. long enough to hit the 6 month residency and then I will never worry about losing my kids.. whether he comes or not.. 

JNMIL runs an illegal dental practice inside her house.. not sure if that's enough to scare DH with from pulling anything.. my kids also have complaints where she denies their mental health.. denies them asthma meds (says their mom - me-is too paranoid and gives them too many meds).. tells them I stole her son from her.. tells them their other grandparents (my parents) are bad because they don't visit.. don;t love them and if they did they'd move to NY to be near them.. she bathes with my 9 year old daughter when I've said STOP.. she's going thru puberty and too old to bathe nude with others.. she boundary stomps.. gosh WAY worse stuff but you get the picture.. My older two are starting to pick up on it and don't want to go there and after a traumatic family event finally feel safe just being with me not being sent there but are scared to tell their Dad.. he does this weird denial/bribery thing.. it just doesn't make sense.. 

  
I want to leave back home to CA if he doesn't eventually come around.. I love him to death but he has totally turned on me when it comes to his mom.. it is BIZARRE.. like he's a wounded child again..and I know he has severe abandonment issues from her/his dad leaving him when he was a toddler to come to the USA (they weren't poor.. just a choice they made).. I suspect he has something genetic or something in his body that's off also contributing heavily to this neuropsych distress because he did this 180 out of NOWHERE.

  
So without even all THOSE issues.. are there ANY of you here who live thousands of miles away from your support system and who want to divorce/move away from husband (for what it's worth in MY case I don't want a divorce and PURPOSELY wouldn't as to NOT speed up any potential child custody stuff-- and I KNOW if he moved our marriage would survive and I'd be able to snap him out of it without his mom in the background).. and NOT lose your children? 

I do NOT want to keep his kids from him.. but he agreed for years in marriage counseling we'd move.. for better COL.. a better life.. because my son/I have seasonal depression.. and I don't have family nearby so by default I'd have to go back to CA.. I am also a SAHM and would need a support system to go back to school and work.. I do not have that here.. 

  
I am MISERABLE because of JNMIL.. she does not leave us alone and everything in our marriage has been great.. except this.. Took him years but he started standing up.. setting boundaries.. now he's not in a good mental spot.. not himself and I believe extremely easily influenced by her at the moment.. I cannot live like this.. I cannot get stuck here.. for her to win.. for her to get my kids .. I'm not even sad for me.. I'm sad for my kids.. they deserved a family.. a mom and dad.. and a stable home and a beautiful life out of here.. My husband wanted that so bad too.. but it's like his mom gets in his ear and keeps him in self doubt and it's like he is stuck on settling here now.. it's the saddest most abusive thing I've seen and he's blind to it.

I want to give him an ultimatum and leave but truly cannot lose my kids.. I don't know a way around this.. I get that I need to consult a lawyer and I will.. but have ANY of you managed to escape this kind of situation and in laws?

While my confidence isn't high, a lot of people who know him seem to think he'll follow and me leaving will be the push he needs but I cannot even stand the 1% chance of ILs getting involved and me somehow getting pulled back here, stuck and having to share my kids with them bc JNMIL would likely convince him to move back in.. My kids would DIE going from being safe with me all the time with her and it's hard to prove emotional/mental abuse..

I actually do NOT want to divorce my husband but just GET HIM OUT OF HERE.. YES it will rebalance us and get us 90% of the way.. I can handle him from here.. but I am miserable here and the JNMIL is the cherry on top.. I'm getting depression.. showing symptoms of autoimmune issues from the stress.. my youngest is 5.. I cannot do this for 12 more years.. 

  
HAVE ANY OF YOU PULLED THIS OFF?? .. or at least tried it and left the state with kids while married? I do NOT want to come back OR have my kids taken from me.. the most I can settle for is summers to Dad IF things don't pan out",6,1732317042.0,JUSTNOMIL,6,0.88,False

Mystery Flesh Pit homebrew DND 5e adventure

The Heroes (Wizard,Archer,Barbarian,Assassin, Artificer NPC) make their way to the hidden CEO base 100 km away via the Pit Subway System. The rail line was finished 30 years ago. The system has not been maintained. The Pit is huge like this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FleshPitNationalPark/comments/y07sz2/the\_pbso\_visualized\_on\_earths\_surface/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FleshPitNationalPark/comments/y07sz2/the_pbso_visualized_on_earths_surface/)

Music is YouTube ""Liminal Spaces Dark Ambient Music Mix""

Not shown on the map above is the central subway train loop, and the spoke lines that radiate from the GRAND CENTRAL STATION. Basically most junctions have 3 options to choose from for safety/redundancy. In its heyday the subway system took visitors to the parks fabled destinations (in approved areas) like:

• Walking/Hiking

• Running Marathons

• Camping

• Fishing in the gastric sea and ponds

• Fluid activities: Go fluid rafting, canoeing, kayaking, stand up paddle boarding, or tubing on the lazy river.

• Mountain Climbing, Ice Climbing

• Cave Exploring (spelunking)

• Soak in amniotic pools, salt water steam baths, ‘mud’ baths. (hint: its not mud)

• Exotic wildlife watching

• Ranger-led tours: Take a tour led by a park ranger 

• Junior Ranger programs: Participate in a Junior Ranger program and earn a badge 

• Picnicking: Have a picnic (and store food properly so as not to lure predators) 

• Nature scavenger hunts

• Animal calls

• Creature riding

• Petting zoo

• Lower Visitors Center – Shopping

• Lower Visitors Center – Museum 

• Lower Visitors Center – Dining 

• Lower Visitors Center – Hotel and Convention Center 

• Lower Visitors Center – Concerts and Symposiums 

• Watch the creature scare crow rodeo at the underground fairgrounds

From the Lower Visitors Center, the Heroes can go NORTH, EAST, or SOUTH via rail. Dice roll says NORTH line works. The Artificer NPC is able to operate a subway light rail car and proceed.

While navigating the Pit, the following Environments/Traps present themselves.

Roll a d 13 to determine damage type

• (1) Acid. The corrosive spray emanating from glands in cave walls. It’s kind of like the acid from the movie “Alien”.

• (2) Bludgeoning. Blunt force from constricting/spasm collapsing cave walls.

• (3) Cold/Blizzard. Part of the creatures natural cooling system. Like air conditioning in a car. A large blast of -89.2°C (-128.6°F)

• (4) Fire. Part of the creatures natural heating system. A blast of -360.2°C (-680.5°F). Believed to come from geothermal heat sources.

• (5) Force or Flood or Windstorm or Sandstorm. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. The PBSO is magical.

• (6) Lightning. Part of the PBSO’s nervous system. Like an electric eel. Capable of millions of volts of potential.

• (7) Necrotic. The PBSO can drain life from visitors. Vampire style.

• (8) Piercing/Slashing. The PBSO has various cave sections made of diamond hard devouring teeth.

• (9) Poison/Medicine. The PBSO can release fluids that are natural to it, but have a variety of helpful/harmful effects on visitors.

• (10) Psychic. Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage. Illusions, deceptions, voices, impressions.

• (11) Radiant. The PBSO can deal out Radiant energy

• (12) Thunder. A concussive burst of sound that come from pistol organs. When the PBSO senses foreign movement, it stuns the intruders. 

• (13) Magnet pulse. Sucks to be a person wearing metal armor or using metal weapons.

Part 1 of subway journey dice roll says minor encounter with HANGING MOSS/CREATURE. The subway is mildly impeded. When the pit was active, debris like this was routinely removed by park staff via a ticketing system. Heroes take a short rest during transit.

Junction 2 dice roll sends the heroes to the GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SWN/comments/1f9j6we/the\_abandoned\_warehouse\_factory\_45\_x\_32\_details/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWN/comments/1f9j6we/the_abandoned_warehouse_factory_45_x_32_details/)

Heroes determine that they simply need to make their way across the map to get on the appropriate tracks. This map is a monster gauntlet. 

Music changes to You tube ""DND Battle Music""

First Monster is a CRIMSON MIST, The 2nd monster is a GHAST OF LENG. While sniping from above, a dice roll says the Hero Arakokra Archer is distracted and attacked by a STORM SPIRIT.

Heroes handily defeat the 3 monsters.

The 4th monster is encountered near the subway car they're heading for.

The monster waiting for them is an amorphous force of nebulous evil energy that is a by-product of the Pit's consciousness. The energy coalesces into a physical creature based on a fear of the players (like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man), but it is determined that the coalesced creature is a large/giant Merman from the movie ""Cabin in the woods"". The stats for this monster are from GOLEM WAR MACHINE.

The heroes make it into a subway car and close the door. The MerMan swings at the door and dents it. The car needs to be moved to another track. It is determined that there is a train office nearby. The Arakokra fly's to the office, mashes a button, and fly's back to the subway car as the car is being moved to the appropriate tracks.

The Assassin nerfs the Merman and slows its speed.

The MerMan catches up to the subway car. The Heroes look in horror as the MerMan swings and destroys the door.

Dice Roll says the Artificer NPC is able to ram the throttle and yell LAUNCH (like the rebel alliance officer at the end of the movie ""Rogue One"") 

As the subway speeds away at 60 kph, the MerMan cant hang onto the car and starts running after the Heroes.

Heroes take a short rest during transit.

Random encounter dice roll is NECROTIC. As the subway passes this area, the heroes take necrotic damage.

Dice roll says Heroes proceed at a junction.

Dice roll (1 on a d20) says major bad encounter with (dice roll) Freezing cold. The subway car has hit a frozen section of tunnel. The train derails, heroes take fall damage. Heroes attack the ice blockage. Heroes manage to muscle the car back onto the tracks and proceed on wobbly wheels slowly. 

Heroes make it to the end of the line at the CEO hidden base. The Railway car collapses like the police car in the movie ""Blues Brothers""

Heroes discover an amazon style shipping warehouse with amazon style workers made up of various dnd races.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dndmaps/comments/m5fboz/ocpotion\_factory\_3\_floors\_battlemap\_40x30fg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndmaps/comments/m5fboz/ocpotion_factory_3_floors_battlemap_40x30fg/)

The amazon style workers wear uniforms with back braces. Dice roll says they barely notice the visitors and look around nervously, but keep working to make their quotas. Dice roll says there are no managers/resistance present.

Raven is horrified and enraged. 10 years ago, CEO Cliche proposed to the board to return to mining/profiting. Raven participated in the environmental impact study. It was determined by teams of top experts, that the continued stress on creatures in the pit, and the pit itself were overwhelming. Approval was denied. CEO Cliche is on the verge of waking up the pit which would be cataclysmic for the entire planet. Rage.

With no resistance, Raven bluffs and pretends to be a tour guide, taking the heroes on a tour. She points out obvious things while the Heroes pretend to nod and point. Heroes discover cases of Ballast Brew, Coke Heart Throb, Vision Bracelets, Various Vita-Salves, and more......

This is just the evidence they're looking for to take to the Board Meeting. There are expiration dates on the products. 

Raven bluffs/intimidates the employees and says she needs to collect various cases for sample testing. Cases of product are stowed in a bag of holding. 

Heroes safely traverse level 1 unharmed.

Heroes descend stairs to the packaging level #2. Raven casts DISGUISE to appear like an amazon warehouse manager. This level is being worked by a tougher crowd. Smells like coffee, cigarettes, and beer. It feels like a Waffle House at 2:00 AM. Heavy metal music plays in the background. Various races, no time clocks, no back braces, no uniforms, tattoos, beards, piercings. Many black concert T-shirts. Black biker vests. Head buffs. 

Oh.....This crowd sees the Heroes right away and knows something is up.......

by Josh Salamun

Part 1

An article from the Rapid City newspaper proudly framed in the window reads:

""Mayor Salamander is gathering with leaders to declare, 'This City belongs to Jesus.'""

I can't stand these Christians. They're like harmless little sheep—but in every flock hides a wolf. And I can smell one.

Since then, Mayor Salamander has shown us his ""Christian love"" by shutting down homeless shelters, strangling food services, and unleashing his personal police force to hunt down anyone who doesn't fit into his idea of ""righteous.""

It's been a long time since this witch wandered out of the forests of The Black Hills. That's right. I'm a one-thousand-year-old witch. People say, ""You don't look a day over 30,"" which stings because back in the 1800s, they said, ""not a day over 20."" One thing's clear—Rapid City needs me now more than ever. So here I am, spellbook in hand, ready to squash this Salamander with my black pointy shoes.

In the meantime, I'm investigating his inner circle, which is why I took a job at the local Christian coffee shop, Bean Saved.

It's owned by Pastor Dan, a close friend and supporter of Mayor Salamander.

It's unsettling how this so-called ""Christian"" mayor surrounds himself with people hiding secrets—shadows of the past.

But that's where I find my pretty little victims. A monster lurking in the pews, preying on innocent children, like Creepy Russ. I invite you—peer into my crystal ball.

Trinity Church was where Salamander had his first experience in ministry, serving as the youth pastor. Although he saw the job as an uninteresting stepping stone that would make him look virtuous and serve as something to put on his résumé, that's when he met his solution: Creepy Russ.

An unmarried man in his thirties, more wretched than a disgusting troll, always hanging out with other people's kids, posing as a harmless mentor—but never without his video camera. Always watching through his lens. Salamander saw what went on every Wednesday night but was all too willing to turn a blind eye. He simply didn't care about the horrors going on within the youth group. All he cared about was finding his replacement so he could focus on his real calling in life: furthering his own career.

So, Salamander decided to begin the transition and announced the youth group at Trinity would now start meeting at Creepy Russ's house, so Russ could further groom and prey upon young souls away from the eyes of the church.

Worst of all, one of the victims was none other than Salamander's own half-brother—punished for what happened to him, his name no longer spoken, told to bury the nightmares he endured.

One day, Creepy Russ slipped up while volunteering with youth at the YMCA, following children with his video camera into the locker room.

What Russ saw as his own personal ""innocent home video collection,"" the judge saw as ""child exploitation."" He got out early on a ten-year sentence for ""good behavior.""

To this day, Salamander won't even admit he had a half-brother or his leadership role at Trinity, attempting to cover up his past sins.

But I think the mayor’s half-brother, whoever he is, would be glad to know I took care of Creepy Russ last night. Struck him down after he left this very coffee shop. I followed him home, and when he was sound asleep, I crept in through the window and pulled that monsters guts out and held it in front of his face so he could see how truly rotten he was inside. 

But right now, I should really stop daydreaming. I'm still on the clock.

Pastor Dan waves me over with a too-patient smile that makes my skin crawl. ""A moment, please,"" he says, his voice syrupy with a barbed edge. ""We need to talk about having a servant's heart. Our work here isn't just about coffee; it's about serving the Lord with humility and joy.""

I force a smile, though I imagine his face melting like wax. ""Yes, Pastor Dan. I'll keep that in mind.""

""That's the spirit,"" he says. ""You know, we appreciate your gift for crafting the perfect drink, but I feel you're ready for a new spiritual challenge. Jessica isn’t going to make it, so I'd like you to work the register. You'll find working with people even more engaging. Now, let's see that joy of yours, hmm?""

""I'm spellbound.""

I walk to the register and wipe my hands on my apron as my first customer orders.

""Coffee. Black.""

""Hot or iced?""

""Hot. Scalding,"" he mutters, pulling out a book titled Sword of the Lord.

""Interesting read?""

He sneers. ""It's Mayor Salamander's brilliant book. About rooting out the wicked—the freeloaders, the heathens. All of them can go to hell in a handbasket if you ask me.""

I hand him his cup. ""I see. Must feel like a real witch hunt.""

""You bet it is. I can't believe some people want to act like The Black Hills Witch is some kind of superhero.""

""It certainly seems like magic, how she finds the criminals,"" I reply, smirking.

His gaze sharpens. ""Don't be fooled by tales of her so-called good deeds. She acts like she's above the law!""

I take a steadying breath. ""You may not like her, but you have to admit, she's only gone after bad people.""

""Doesn't matter. Magic is evil, and the Bible is clear: witches, their defenders—they all deserve the same fate.""

""And what fate is that?"" My anger comes out of my fingertips, literally shocking my disgruntled customer. Oops.

His eyes are wide as he realizes what I am. Taking off the lid of his cup, he looks up at me, leaning in closer, and whispers darkly.

""To burn.""

With that, he throws his coffee at me, hot liquid splashes in my face. Pathetic. Little does he know, real witches don't burn.

Annoyed, I wipe my eyes on my apron as he scurries away. I could track him down, turn him into a toad—but he isn't what I'm looking for. Just your average, run-of-the-mill coward.

Pastor Dan scurries over, voice dripping with concern. ""That's a nasty burn. We better pray about this. Let's all gather 'round and pray for healing, everyone.""

""I'm fine, Pastor Dan. I won't let one jerk ruin my first day.” My eyes steady as a candle flame.

He clicks his teeth in disapproval. ""We aren't called to use names like that about our fellow man. Remember our motto here at Bean Saved: 'Treat paying customers the way you would want to be treated.' I think someone needs a lesson in forgiveness. Why don't you go home, pray this over, and remember: let go and let God.""

""And what would Jesus do if someone threw hot coffee in his face?""

Pastor Dan's smile widens. ""Turn the other cheek.""

As I grab my bag, I glance back at the shop. The sign reads: We help those who want God's help. The very same words came from that reptile Salamander's mouth. I know what that really means—pushing everyone outside their flock deeper into the cold.

That's where they'll find me.",1,1732316737.0,blender,0,1.0,False

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1gxkzej,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1gxkzej/cleaning_lady_dumped_the_ice_cubes_i_use_every/,Cleaning lady dumped the ice cubes I use every morning (coffee drama),"Hi, first a disclaimer. I know this drama is super petty but honestly I’m pissed. I work in a small office. We often pitch in for breakfast sandwiches, a coffee maker for everyone and sometimes we split lunches. Well everyone knows I drink my coffee iced. There are trays in the freezer and I make sure to fill them right after I used some.

Well the cleaning lady at work is a grumpy woman. She has her issues, I’m not one to judge but she often will get in the mood to throw stuff away even if it’s not hers but is on the mini kitchen area. 

Two days ago, when I arrived and I was making my coffee (I even use instant to not waste my coworkers) I opened the freezer and all three trays were empty. I immediately knew what happened, and I felt like it was super passive aggressive and kind of rude tbh. 

I asked my supervisor feigning ignorance and she pulled me apart to tell me apparently she brought the trays so if she wanted to dump them sadly she could. Honestly, I know the obvious solution is bringing a tray. But sincerely even though they don’t cost much, based on the backstory I feel like she would definitely throw it away in a fit of anger and that might be really angering because it is unnecessary and mean.

How the heck do I manage this stupid but annoying situation. She has way more seniority and is not an agency employee, she is fully permanent and buddies with the director (not to be confused with my supervisor)

Thoughts?  For context if anyone cares, I say she is grumpy because she will rumble out of nowhere about cleaning anything misplaced. She comes in way earlier than us and cleans the office, and when service hours are up she honestly just yaps with my coworkers or security guard. If someone asks for something from the storage room she complains, says that’s not her job even though she has the key. She will sleep on her station. But since our supervisor is different, it seems she is immune. ",9,1732316603.0,TwoHotTakes,23,0.72,False
1gxkxkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gxkxkn/fn_the_black_hills_witch_part_1/,[FN] The Black Hills Witch- Part 1,"The Black Hills Witch

by Josh Salamun

Part 1

An article from the Rapid City newspaper proudly framed in the window reads:

""Mayor Salamander is gathering with leaders to declare, 'This City belongs to Jesus.'""

I can't stand these Christians. They're like harmless little sheep—but in every flock hides a wolf. And I can smell one.

Since then, Mayor Salamander has shown us his ""Christian love"" by shutting down homeless shelters, strangling food services, and unleashing his personal police force to hunt down anyone who doesn't fit into his idea of ""righteous.""

It's been a long time since this witch wandered out of the forests of The Black Hills. That's right. I'm a one-thousand-year-old witch. People say, ""You don't look a day over 30,"" which stings because back in the 1800s, they said, ""not a day over 20."" One thing's clear—Rapid City needs me now more than ever. So here I am, spellbook in hand, ready to squash this Salamander with my black pointy shoes.

In the meantime, I'm investigating his inner circle, which is why I took a job at the local Christian coffee shop, Bean Saved.

It's owned by Pastor Dan, a close friend and supporter of Mayor Salamander.

It's unsettling how this so-called ""Christian"" mayor surrounds himself with people hiding secrets—shadows of the past.

But that's where I find my pretty little victims. A monster lurking in the pews, preying on innocent children, like Creepy Russ. I invite you—peer into my crystal ball.

Trinity Church was where Salamander had his first experience in ministry, serving as the youth pastor. Although he saw the job as an uninteresting stepping stone that would make him look virtuous and serve as something to put on his résumé, that's when he met his solution: Creepy Russ.

An unmarried man in his thirties, more wretched than a disgusting troll, always hanging out with other people's kids, posing as a harmless mentor—but never without his video camera. Always watching through his lens. Salamander saw what went on every Wednesday night but was all too willing to turn a blind eye. He simply didn't care about the horrors going on within the youth group. All he cared about was finding his replacement so he could focus on his real calling in life: furthering his own career.

So, Salamander decided to begin the transition and announced the youth group at Trinity would now start meeting at Creepy Russ's house, so Russ could further groom and prey upon young souls away from the eyes of the church.

Worst of all, one of the victims was none other than Salamander's own half-brother—punished for what happened to him, his name no longer spoken, told to bury the nightmares he endured.

One day, Creepy Russ slipped up while volunteering with youth at the YMCA, following children with his video camera into the locker room.

What Russ saw as his own personal ""innocent home video collection,"" the judge saw as ""child exploitation."" He got out early on a ten-year sentence for ""good behavior.""

To this day, Salamander won't even admit he had a half-brother or his leadership role at Trinity, attempting to cover up his past sins.

But I think the mayor’s half-brother, whoever he is, would be glad to know I took care of Creepy Russ last night. Struck him down after he left this very coffee shop. I followed him home, and when he was sound asleep, I crept in through the window and pulled that monsters guts out and held it in front of his face so he could see how truly rotten he was inside. 

But right now, I should really stop daydreaming. I'm still on the clock.

Pastor Dan waves me over with a too-patient smile that makes my skin crawl. ""A moment, please,"" he says, his voice syrupy with a barbed edge. ""We need to talk about having a servant's heart. Our work here isn't just about coffee; it's about serving the Lord with humility and joy.""

I force a smile, though I imagine his face melting like wax. ""Yes, Pastor Dan. I'll keep that in mind.""

""That's the spirit,"" he says. ""You know, we appreciate your gift for crafting the perfect drink, but I feel you're ready for a new spiritual challenge. Jessica isn’t going to make it, so I'd like you to work the register. You'll find working with people even more engaging. Now, let's see that joy of yours, hmm?""

""I'm spellbound.""

I walk to the register and wipe my hands on my apron as my first customer orders.

""Coffee. Black.""

""Hot or iced?""

""Hot. Scalding,"" he mutters, pulling out a book titled Sword of the Lord.

""Interesting read?""

He sneers. ""It's Mayor Salamander's brilliant book. About rooting out the wicked—the freeloaders, the heathens. All of them can go to hell in a handbasket if you ask me.""

I hand him his cup. ""I see. Must feel like a real witch hunt.""

""You bet it is. I can't believe some people want to act like The Black Hills Witch is some kind of superhero.""

""It certainly seems like magic, how she finds the criminals,"" I reply, smirking.

His gaze sharpens. ""Don't be fooled by tales of her so-called good deeds. She acts like she's above the law!""

I take a steadying breath. ""You may not like her, but you have to admit, she's only gone after bad people.""

""Doesn't matter. Magic is evil, and the Bible is clear: witches, their defenders—they all deserve the same fate.""

""And what fate is that?"" My anger comes out of my fingertips, literally shocking my disgruntled customer. Oops.

His eyes are wide as he realizes what I am. Taking off the lid of his cup, he looks up at me, leaning in closer, and whispers darkly.

""To burn.""

With that, he throws his coffee at me, hot liquid splashes in my face. Pathetic. Little does he know, real witches don't burn.

Annoyed, I wipe my eyes on my apron as he scurries away. I could track him down, turn him into a toad—but he isn't what I'm looking for. Just your average, run-of-the-mill coward.

Pastor Dan scurries over, voice dripping with concern. ""That's a nasty burn. We better pray about this. Let's all gather 'round and pray for healing, everyone.""

""I'm fine, Pastor Dan. I won't let one jerk ruin my first day.” My eyes steady as a candle flame.

He clicks his teeth in disapproval. ""We aren't called to use names like that about our fellow man. Remember our motto here at Bean Saved: 'Treat paying customers the way you would want to be treated.' I think someone needs a lesson in forgiveness. Why don't you go home, pray this over, and remember: let go and let God.""

""And what would Jesus do if someone threw hot coffee in his face?""

Pastor Dan's smile widens. ""Turn the other cheek.""

As I grab my bag, I glance back at the shop. The sign reads: We help those who want God's help. The very same words came from that reptile Salamander's mouth. I know what that really means—pushing everyone outside their flock deeper into the cold.

They initially complained that in my welcome message prior to their arrival, I mentionned that I have a septic tank and paper can't be thrown directly in the toilet. They were confused and said ""where do I throw the toilet paper then?"" lol..okay...

Now, they're complaining that I don't have a Keurig machine and saying how disappointing and terrible that is, almost ruined their trip here... despite that I do have the other ones available (Tassimo, Nespresso, Coffee Pot and a variety of teas provided).

I must admit, Keurig was listed as an amenitie, but I believe that Airbnb didn't offer the chance to make a distinction a few years ago when I last made an update or it could've been a mistake by me. Either way, is that really the end of the world?
