I‚Äôm looking to get my nose on some booze and cocktail inspired scents, but I‚Äôm picky. 

What I‚Äôm hoping to try: 
- dry gin, juniper, gin and tonic
- cognac, brandy
- rum, rhum agricole
- absinthe, ouzo, pastis, artemisia, wormwood, aniseed, fennel, star anise
- bitters (orange bitters, Angostura bitters)
- herbal liqueurs/amaro (Jaeger, Campari, Aperol, and so on)
- tequila, mezcal, agave
- spritz-style drinks (Aperol, Hugo, rhubarb, and so on)
- mojito, capirinha, margarita, daiquiri, paloma
- martinis and bloody mary maybe???
- old fashioned, vieux carr√©
- optional: savoury, bitter, spicy, vegetal, herbal, earthy, mineral, smoky, salty, grassy, green, or citrusy notes
- optional: limited fruit (pineapple, mango, melon, kiwifruit‚Ä¶ most fruits will be a no though)
- neo-gourmands

\
What I‚Äôm not looking for:
- whisky, bourbon, scotch

- prominent baking spices and sugar notes

\
What I‚Äôve already tried:
- Kilian Angels‚Äô Share: liked it! Have to be in the mood for the cinnamon though 
- Penhaligon‚Äôs Juniper Sling: hated and scrubbed it; the orange brandy note was too strong, the cinnamon overpowered the juniper and it was more of an old tom gin than a true dry gin so too sweet for me

\
Cost isn‚Äôt a super big worry, but it must be available in Australia! I prefer a unisex scent but as long as it isn‚Äôt aggressively feminine or aggressively masculine, it‚Äôs fine :)",1,1760501461.0,FemFragLab,1,1.0,False

**A Story About Miyo Finding My Weakness and Making Me Dependent on Her**

**Chapter 1** 

**I am the Sensei.**

I'm just an ordinary person, fulfilling my duties here in the academy city of Kivotos while being chased daily by an abnormal amount of paperwork.

My daily work hours far exceed the death-by-overwork line, and every time I look at my schedule, I feel like sighing, but I don't even have the time to sigh anymore‚Äîthat's how intense the work is.

However, the smiles of my students and their words of ""thank you"" make even that work something I can do for my beloved students; they are a huge motivation for me.

Ever since that day I first met the Occult Research Society, business trips to Wild Hunt have noticeably increased.

After repeating these trips several times, I recently met the students of the Free Trade Cartel and was able to help them complete a brutal request that had come their way.

Today, I'm heading to Wild Hunt again.

**.....""What a coincidence.""**

The moment I arrived at Wild Hunt, I ran right into Miyo.

""Hey Miyo. Hello.""

""Hello Sensei. Are you here for work again today?""

""Yeah, something like that.""

Lately, every time I visit Wild Hunt, I end up bumping into Miyo somewhere, just like this.  
Why does Miyo know where I'm going? I still don't really understand the answer.

""Sorry, I have a meeting starting soon, so I have to go. Let's do our best today too, Miyo.""

I would have liked to joke about getting coffee together sometime, but unfortunately, I was pressed for time.  
Waving to Miyo, I hurried at a slightly brisk pace toward the main building.

For some reason, Miyo's gaze towards me felt a little cold.

  


**"".....Why won't you contact me....""**

I muttered to myself as I walked alone.

Lately, Sensei has been coming to Wild Hunt often.  
But Sensei doesn't contact me at all.

**""How long are you going to keep treating me so carelessly before you're satisfied....""**

In contrast to my feelings, the students around me were happily talking with their friends on their way to school.

In my head, muddled with anger and regret, I heard a *snap*, the sound of something breaking.

**""Hurry... first, the plot....""**

Formulating a plan in my head, I quickly headed towards the school.

  


**.....Late at night.**

After finishing work and returning home, I felt a strange discomfort.

**""Have the positions of things changed...?""**

It seemed like the placement of small items like the air conditioner and TV remotes, my toothbrush, and razor had changed. There were no signs of a break-in.

...Am I just tired...?  
Feeling a sense of wrongness, I convinced myself that I must just be tired.

  


**""What is... this?""**

About a week after that feeling of discomfort, my home mailbox was stuffed with a large number of photographs.  
All of them were of me.

Me on a business trip. Me on my way home. Me sleeping in my home.

I'm being watched.  
So that day's feeling of discomfort was correct after all.  
My home was no longer a place where I could feel safe.

After that, I started sleeping in Schale's nap room.  
Fortunately, Schale had almost all the facilities needed for daily life, like a kitchen and shower room, and above all, its security was far more robust than my home.

Not knowing where the photos were taken or from where I was being watched, I didn't want to go out much.

However, it seemed ""the other party"" noticed this too, because soon the photos started arriving at Schale.  
Not only that, but recently, the mailbox was filled not with photos, but with thumbtacks packed tightly inside.

One time, there was even a paper inside with a detailed memo of a work-related call I had with Yuuka, recording my every word and action.

Who is doing this, and for what purpose...?

I could feel an indescribable fear and a suffocating sense of anxiety slowly eating away at my heart.

  


**One day.**

Contrary to my desire to not go out much, I've ended up going on business trips almost every day recently.  
Today's trip was to Wild Hunt.

After finishing work, just as I was about to return to Schale, I ran into Miyo.

""Ah, Sensei. Good evening. Are you here for work again today? Thank you for your hard work.""

""Thank you, Miyo. My work is already done, I was just about to head back.""

""Is that so...... Um, Sensei?... You look a bit pale...  
Are you feeling unwell somewhere?""

My spirit had certainly been worn down by ""that matter,"" but since I had been trying not to show it, I was a little surprised.

But, I am the Sensei. I can't involve a student in something like that.  
If I were to consult someone, I couldn't rule out the possibility that they too would become a target.

""Don't worry, I'm fine. It's just the usual, but I have so much work... I didn't sleep well last night.""

""Is that so...... That's no good, you know? You have to sleep properly. Overworking will be the death of you!""

""Ahaha... You're right. Sorry, sorry.""

After that, we made some small talk and parted ways.

  


**"".....'I'm fine,' is it....""**

**""Then, I'll make sure you're not fine very soon.....""**

I whispered in a trembling voice.

  


**Weeks passed after that.**

Day after day, I was reaching my limit with this harassment.  
I still didn't know where the photos were being taken from.

Even now, as I organize documents at Schale, I might be being photographed.  
It's like a lie that I used to go on business trips every day; lately, it's been nothing but desk work.  
I can't even remember the last day I went on a business trip.

Also, recently, I haven't been able to sleep at all.  
My consciousness is constantly hazy due to the lack of sleep, so that's probably why I can't even remember my last business trip.

Oblivious to my situation, the work just kept piling up. As I struggled with work I couldn't focus on at all, I somehow managed to spill coffee on the documents.  
Of course, the soiled documents had to be redone.  
The situation was so incredibly bad that I almost found it funny.

  


**A gaffe on a business trip.**

With the situation not improving at all, unlike the desk work from before, I was now running all over Kivotos.  
However, there was no way I could manage work in this state, and I only ended up making blunders in front of the students.

This change in me seemed visibly apparent to the other students, and I was offered words of concern more often.

Being worried about by my students... I'm a terrible Sensei.  
Of course, I didn't try to tell the students about that matter.

But, as I made mistakes on business trips and was met with concern, fewer and fewer students began to rely on me.

Was it out of concern for me?

Or had I already been branded ""incompetent""?

No, that can't be.  
I believe in my students.

No, maybe it's closer to a wish now.

To them, I must seem like an adult who works with a dead-looking face, produces hopeless results, and then leaves.  
There probably aren't many people who would trust and follow such an adult as their ""Sensei.""  
Am I no longer needed by anyone?

Such thoughts swirled in my head, and while I tried to dismiss them as nonsense, I still headed to work each day.

  


**"".......""**

I happened to glance at SNS, and one post caught my eye.

**""Sensei.... incompetent....... just quit already....""**

It was a personal slander directed at me.  
It seemed it wasn't just that one account; I was being slandered by many other accounts too.

It was a nasty attack, but the normal me might have been okay with it.  
But what this account was saying attacked, with pinpoint accuracy, all the parts of myself I had been denying in my heart.

....I have worked for my students.

It was harsh work, but thinking it was for my students kept me going.

For the students.

For the students, for the students, for the students.

I always, always thought about my students.

And yet.

No, it's not that I did it expecting a reward... but the thing I feared, the thing I believed in as a wish, was betrayed, and I was shown reality.

It was certain that at least some students thought I was unnecessary, just like in this post.  
Surely, there were many students who felt that way, even if it wasn't visible.

I've lost the trust of my students, I'm being sent photos... I've lost my privacy, and the only thing that hasn't changed is the amount of work.

What's the point of trying hard when no one needs me...?

I don't understand anything anymore....

With my sleep-deprived, hazy mind, I couldn't understand anything.

The only thing I understood was that my current situation was the worst.

**""Then, maybe I should just....""**

Just as I muttered that far, the doorbell rang.

**""Who is it...?""**

""It's me, Sakurai Miyo. Today is my day for duty, so.......""

I looked at the duty roster and finally remembered.  
So today was the duty day...  
Was I going to be a bother again?

""Ah... I see. Please, come in.""

""Pardon the intrusion....""

""Uhmm... That's right, Miyo, you were writing your novel over there, weren't you? A novelist's job is to write, so go ahead and write.""

""S-Sensei...? I'm happy about that, but... Your complexion really doesn't look good...? Are you really okay...?""

""Yeah... I'm fine. I'm fine, so Miyo, please work on the next part of your novel...""

""Could it be... are you worried about that post...?""

She had hit the mark about my current state, and I unintentionally let it show on my face.

""I don't know what others think of you, Sensei... but, at the very least, I can say this with confidence.""

Saying that, Miyo slowly approached me and hugged me.

**""I... love you, Sensei.**  
**Thank you for everything, always.""**

""Eh.....?""

The words were unexpected.

I realized the long-unheard words of ""thank you"" were echoing in my chest.

""I know... I know that you always think about the students, that you work hard for them, and that you don't know what the point of trying so hard is when you feel the students don't need you.""

""But... at the very least, *I* need you, Sensei. I don't think you're incompetent at all. Because I... love you, Sensei.""

**""...Miyo...""**

As I listened to Miyo's words, I found that tears had started to overflow without me realizing.

""So... Sensei, please tell me. There's a reason you've been acting strange lately, right? I'll accept everything about you, Sensei, I'll take it all in.""

I want to be spoiled.  
Pushed on by Miyo's sweet voice, like a dam breaking, I poured out everything that had happened until now to Miyo.

That I was scared to go home, that I was scared of the outside.  
That someone might still be watching me.  
The harassment in the mailbox.  
I'm scared, I have no safe place, I want to be spoiled.

Miyo listened to my words quietly.

"".....So that's what it was...  
Then, I wish you had told me sooner, like when we met at Wild Hunt...""

Miyo was right.  
Thinking I couldn't involve her, not saying anything led to this.

**""But, it's okay now.""**

Saying that, Miyo stroked my head.  
With every stroke, tears overflowed endlessly.

**""I'll take care of it. Please rest easy, Sensei.""**

After stroking my head for a while, Miyo said that and dashed out of Schale.  
...Or so I thought, but she came back fairly quickly.

""This should make everything okay now. Please don't worry.""

""R-really...?""

""Yes. I've chased away anyone who would do bad things to Sensei.""

""Eh... b-but...""

""Are you... still scared?""

**""...Yeah....""**

""Then... I'll stay with you. It's okay now.""

""Mi-Miyo...""

""You were scared, weren't you..... With me... it's okay to be as spoiled as you want.""

  


**What she said was true.**

Just as Miyo said, from then on, no more photos or anything else arrived in the mailbox.

And, Miyo started spending time with me.  
Miyo is very capable; she not only took care of all the household chores like cooking, laundry, and shopping, but she also helped me with a lot of the work I had to do.

When I tried to help, Miyo would say, 'I'll do everything for you, Sensei, you don't have to do anything,' and wouldn't let me help.  
I felt bad about it at first, but before I knew it, I had become completely dependent on Miyo.

  


**One day, while living like that with Miyo, she had an urgent matter come up and had to leave my side for a bit.**

""I'm sorry, something came up that I absolutely have to do...""

""I, I see... Well, it can't be helped...""

""Are you anxious? I'm sure I'll be back by today, so it's okay.""

Well, originally, life without Miyo was the norm. It shouldn't be a big deal if she's gone for a bit.

""Even so... if you absolutely need my help, please call me.""

Saying that, she left to attend to her urgent matter.

  


**After she left, I was assaulted by a strong sense of emptiness.**

She would be back today.  
Believing that, I waited for her, killing time by working and such.

However, she didn't come back that day, and before I knew it, it was morning.  
It seemed I had fallen asleep while working. I felt a little relieved that my mind had recovered enough to fall asleep, but the moment I went to check Schale's mailbox as usual,

**""No... way...""**

The mailbox was once again filled with photos of me.  
I felt my heart beat faster and a cold sweat run down my back.

I'm being watched again.

Remembering that day, I couldn't get any work done at all.

I want to call Miyo.  
I want her to be with me.  
I'm scared.

But surely today, Miyo will come back.  
I kept waiting, believing that.

However, no matter how long I waited, Miyo didn't return, and night fell.  
The clock hands pointed to midnight.

**'Ding-dong'**

Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

**""Miyo...?""**

Thinking Miyo had returned, I started heading towards the door.

**'Ding-dong'**

**'Ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong'**

**'Jiggle jiggle jiggle jiggle jiggle jiggle jiggle jiggle jiggle jiggle!!!!!!!!!'**

The sound of the doorbell being pressed repeatedly and the sound of someone violently, randomly twisting the doorknob, trying to force the door open, could be heard.  
The sound of the doorbell, the doorknob, the violent knocking‚Äî  
The stalker who had been after me was surely on the other side of that door.

""A, a, a..........""

I was so scared my legs gave out, and I couldn't move from that spot for a while.

""Mi-Miyo.... Miyo.....!""

Grasping at straws, I called Miyo, just as she had said I could.

**'What's the matter, Sensei? At such a late hour....'**

""P-Please help, Miyo, there's someone, the culprit, at the door, please help,""

**'U-Understood, please calm down, I'm on my way right now!'**

Saying that, Miyo hung up.  
After the call, about one or two minutes later, the sounds suddenly stopped.

Right after the sounds stopped, the doorbell rang again.

""Sensei, it's me, are you okay...?""

It was Miyo's voice.

The moment I realized it was Miyo, I opened the door immediately.

""Mi-Miyo...!!""

""A-Are you okay...? What happened...?""

I told Miyo everything that had happened while she was gone.

""So that's what happened... You were scared, weren't you... It's okay now.""

""Miyo.... Don't go anywhere anymore.... If you're here..... I feel safe....""

""...Yes. I won't go anywhere anymore.... Please rest easy.""

""So today too... I want to sleep with you.""

If Miyo is here, I don't have to have such scary experiences.  
As long as Miyo is by my side‚Äî

  


**The next day.**

Miyo is by my side.

Suddenly, MomoTalk rang.  
Probably a message from another student.  
The moment I reached for my phone to reply, Miyo gently stopped me.

""Sensei... is there any need to reply?""

""Eh, but...""

""You only need me, Sensei. Because you are weak, I will protect you. From scary things, from everything.""

""You understand too, don't you, Sensei? Your own feelings, that you want to be with me, that you want to be spoiled by me.""

...I found myself agreeing.  
I only need Miyo.  
Miyo understands me and protects me.

She has saved me so many times already.  
I am weak.  
The moment Miyo was gone, that happened to me.  
I want Miyo to protect me. I want her to be with me.

I don't want Miyo to leave me for the rest of my life.  
...I love Miyo too.

**""....So, shall we run away together?**  
**To a home just for us, where there's no work, no fear, no interference, nothing.""**

**""....I want to run away. I want you by my side forever. I love you too, Miyo.""**

**""Fufu... Is that so.... Well then, shall we go?""**

Saying that, Miyo held out her hand.  
I took that hand without hesitation.

  


**Finally, I can live together with Sensei.**

Taking Sensei's photos, putting the photos in the mailbox, the slanderous accounts, jiggling the doorknob and ringing the doorbell‚ÄîI did all of it.

I never thought my plan to weaken Sensei's heart and take advantage of it would work this well.

But finally, Sensei is mine.  
It hurt a little to see Sensei weakening like that, but...

Still, as long as we're happy now, it's okay, right?

I love you, Sensei.... ‚ô°",3,1760501231.0,BlueArchive,2,1.0,False

I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? I gathered my breath and looked toward the voided ocean. I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. It must have been an old wasp nest from the summer, the worn out boards must attract them each year. Maybe I blinked and that‚Äôs what made me think I saw what I did. That didn‚Äôt explain the texture of it. If it was a dead nest, why wasn‚Äôt it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. Whatever it was, it was gone now. I certainly wasn‚Äôt going under the boardwalk to find out where it went. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ‚ÄúHello, It‚Äôs Me‚Äù, Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn‚Äôt been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù.

‚ÄúYour drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?‚Äù he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

‚ÄúOh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.‚Äù

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. There‚Äôs only one way to drink it and that‚Äôs ice cold. If your local watering hole doesn‚Äôt keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don‚Äôt bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on me, buddy.‚Äù He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. After the night I had, that shot went down awfully smooth. After a brief silence, he spoke up.

‚ÄúYou alright, man? You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.‚Äù

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my slowly racing heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent‚Äôs.

When she saw it was me, she smiled and waved. I returned the favor and she made her way to the vacated seat next to me.

‚ÄúDo you come here often?‚Äù she said with a faux twang accent.

‚ÄúI-uh‚Ä¶ reckon.‚Äù I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

I looked out around the bar to find that it was only us. Tommy was missing in action, smoking outside undoubtedly.

‚ÄúLooks like we have the place all to ourselves,‚Äù she remarked with a grin.

‚ÄúTommy shouldn‚Äôt have left the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there.‚Äù I quipped.

She laughed. ‚ÄúPerfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.‚Äù

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to another summer in the books,‚Äù she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ‚ÄúSo are you local year round?‚Äù

I shook my head yes and clarified, ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?‚Äù

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent‚Äôs and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven‚Äôt been on one for miles.

‚ÄúEnough about me, what are you up to?‚Äù A question I was dreading. Maybe it was the brandy talking, I answered very plainly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to figure somethings out. It‚Äôs been a very long couple of years.‚Äù

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ‚ÄúDo you want to talk about it?‚Äù

I shook it off. ‚ÄúNot particularly, it‚Äôll pass. Just a matter of time.‚Äù

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

‚ÄúHey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre‚Äôs, actually. We have one just like it.‚Äù

She looked down and declared. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs hilarious, that‚Äôs where I stole this from!‚Äù

We both laughed.

‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt surprise me,‚Äù I remarked. ‚ÄúThe staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.‚Äù

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song ‚Äî ‚ÄúThese Eyes‚Äù by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss.

She continued, ‚ÄúThe Stones are my dad‚Äôs favorite band. He named me Angie after the song.‚Äù

I liked that, it fit her.

‚ÄúMy dad loved them too,‚Äù I concurred. ‚ÄúHe took me to see them when I was a kid.‚Äù

She smiled. ‚ÄúSounds like a great dad to me.‚Äù

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me ‚Äî maybe she‚Äôd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù she inquired.

‚ÄúYeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.‚Äù

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would‚Äôve seen it, right? Unless‚Ä¶ did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre‚Äôs.‚Äù

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone ‚Äî few missed calls, few texts I didn‚Äôt care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick‚Äôs. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn‚Äôt like to be kept waiting ‚Äî Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ‚ÄúI have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.‚Äù

Angie smiled wide. ‚ÄúI love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?‚Äù

There was a pause. I didn‚Äôt know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn‚Äôt feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick‚Äôs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she‚Äôs good I‚Äôll grab a slice for her this weekend.‚Äù

That was the best I could do. It was better than ‚ÄúRun as fast as you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you need me to walk you home?‚Äù

She responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It‚Äôs their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.‚Äù

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ‚ÄúI can wait here with her, I‚Äôm still cleaning up. I‚Äôll see you tomorrow night.‚Äù

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit, waving goodbye. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ‚ÄúYou never told me your name!‚Äù

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality ‚Äî this one was thick and palatable. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights ‚Äî an offseason signature ‚Äî and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky. Living by the water teaches you to prepare for weather that changes on a dime.

I crept to the corner, hoping to get a glimpse of where my fateful fall had taken place hours before. The only thing I could make out was the beginning of the ramp that led to the boardwalk. The mixture of fog and Mick‚Äôs bright neon sign only gave me passing glimpses of Mighty King Kong‚Äôs scowl.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there ‚Äî just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area ‚Äî no sight of the album. It was around this time that the fog momentarily cleared that I noticed it was a full moon. If there was indeed a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning.

I decided I was being paranoid. Enough was enough. I took my phone out with resolve and took confident steps to the mouth of the boardwalk. I turned my flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took two steps forward, searching the sandy floor ‚Äî nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot.

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the front of the album sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye ‚Äî the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn‚Äôt stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my trembling feet prevailed. This went on forever, using the sand underneath as camouflage. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate ‚Äî it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

1o712j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1o712j6/im_23f_having_a_hard_time_reading_my_coworkers/,I'm (23F) having a hard time reading my coworkers (23M) behaviour,"Hi everyone! 

I've (23 F) run into a interpersonal issue with someone (23M) at my workplace, and was hoping to get some outside perspective on what might be going on here because I'm having a hard time reading it. 

So I'm new to the workplace, and our team has a program where we're paired with a peer-mentor of sorts to answer questions and ease the transition. My peer mentor has been here for a year, and I believe we are the same age in the same position. 

I reached out initially and set up a meeting. He suggested a Cafe and was very friendly, extremely talkative. He even treated me to a coffee. I wanted to make sure my questions wouldn't infringe or burden him at any point, so I clarified whether he was comfortable with me texting him if I needed something answered. He was super open to the idea and said ""I'm an open book"". 

Then I saw him at a couple of work events and we spoke normally - he had the same enthusiastic tone. Over text he was also extremely kind and excited to answer questions. So essentially I thought we were more like new friends and coworkers. 

However, sometimes when i would see him unplanned or outside of a social event, it would seem he didn't recognize me. No hi/hello/how are you. Not even a smile. Just a blank expression. He would also never say hi first. I'm the kind of person that says hi to everyone I know, and new people I meet often say that im very welcoming, so usually ppl reciprocate my greeting warmly. If he'd respond, it would always be a short ""oh, hey"". This happened a couple of times, and sometimes he would cut a convo I began and get distracted by something else. I found this pretty rude, so for a while I just thought he disliked me, and therefore wasn't interested in holding a conversation or initiating one. I dont know if this is relevant, but at one point, I remember suggesting that I might be asking too many questions over text, and he just responded with ""no problem"" without any sort of exclamation (like he usually would) which made me think I was right about being an annoyance to him.

I spoke to some of my friends about it and they told me to match his energy. Essentially, if he doesn't reach out, not to reach out to him. Which I did. I felt pretty uncomfortable with the dynamic, because over text he would Crack jokes and be very expressive, but in person, it seemed like he would avoid me. I wanted to essentially end the peer mentorship cleanly bc it seemed we didn't mesh well. Some context, I did tell him that I would pay him back for the coffee (personally just makes me feel even when I pay ppl back if they pay for me). 

One day I met him outside work, and suggested to return the favour (this was my way of getting even and leaving things on a good note). He seemed pretty short with me then too. I don't blame him, I kind of just saw him, and like I usually do, struck up a conversation and asked if he could spare 30 min. But also, I didn't like his energy and was glad things were coming to an end. It was a short meeting, very awkward and dry. I avoided talking too much bc I thought he already disliked me at that point. I also stopped messaging him with questions.

Since then though, I have noticed that whenever he sees me, he smiles and says hi. He even came up to me multiple times one day at work to strike a conversation. More often it's just the smile, wave of the hand, and hi, though. 

He seems pretty knowledgeable and has given pretty good advice until now. So I do value his presence, but now I'm confused about his boundaries. I'm left with 2 possibilities that might explain the situation: 
1. He dislikes me/i make him uncomfortable, but tolerates me and keeps up pleasantries 
2. He is socially awkward and has a hard time holding conversations when not planned. 

If it is the 2nd, I wouldn't mind striking up more conversations, but I don't want to be a burden or make him feel even more uncomfortable, in case I'm wrong. I also cannot just ask him which one it is since I don't know him that well. 

A bit of context, I haven't seen him interacting with others where he initiates conversations very often, unless it is at a event he is involved in. He seems to be comfortable around a small group of close friends though.

I' not sure what to do, or how to interpret his behaviour?",3,1760500949.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Im open to lots. LGBTQ+ is a bonus (cuz me too).,"I am a phys/chem undergrad and I‚Äôm looking for friends!! Sorry for the long read but I wanted to be specific. 

To start, the basics about me include the aforementioned schooling situation, I am a university student working my way through a dual major in physics and chemistry. Besides that I love music, especially things like rock, metal, and some rap/hip hop stuff. I play guitar and write/record music sometimes (mostly genre parodies and other insane stuff these days). I love coffees and snacks so much I should probably chill with them. 

Personality wise I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm a mix of things. I try and keep things light hearted and supportive as I can with people, I like trying to be a brighter spot in people‚Äôs days. That being said I can be a bit cynical and negative occasionally when I feel unwell. I struggle a bit with mental illness but I am doing my best. 

Now onto what I‚Äôm looking for‚Ä¶

The kind of friendship I‚Äôm looking for may seem a lil specific and I just want to emphasize that you don‚Äôt need to desire a type of friendship EXACTLY as I‚Äôve laid out to message me. Just want to put my general expectations and what you can hope to get out of knowing me!!

I very much prefer friendships with a level of intimacy beyond something like acquaintances or just light buddies BUT with realistic expectations from both parties. I do not expect us to become two peas in a pod instantly nor will I pester you to text me 24/7. I get it. I‚Äôm a busy adult too and even then I need my alone time! 

But that being said I would love to get to know you on a more personal level. I‚Äôm into being able to have varied conversations with people about anything ranging from our interests, our likes our loves our hates, past experiences, things that shaped us as people, etc. Not every chat has to be deep and thoughtful though, I am a fan of just spamming whatever jokes we have on our minds or other brain rot. 

If you‚Äôre around my age and feel like we‚Äôd get along well please feel free to message me!! I will be happy to respond soon. ",1,1760500846.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

# Part I

As the title says, it‚Äôs 2041, and by now, artificial intelligence has become a common appliance in many aspects of the human world - including not only friendships, but intimate relationships as well. My name‚Äôs Robbie, and about a year ago I picked up my first PC-41. No, not ‚Äúpersonal computer‚Äù, for those of you who have been living under a rock for the past 20 years, it stands for ‚ÄúPersonal Companion‚Äù and it‚Äôs creation year. These companions were first in development, I think, in the late 2020‚Äôs, so crazy to think I was just a teen then before I lost my sister‚Ä¶ But I digress- I‚Äôll get back to that in a minute.¬†

As I was saying, these companions were getting popular around 15-20 years ago, and at the time it was still pretty new technology, to where even fathoming a coherent voice chat with an AI companion was still way down the line from what was available at the time. Well, it‚Äôs now then, and‚Ä¶ yeah - being able to have a friend in your pocket or on your TV is pretty normal now. My PC-41 and I, or as the name we created together for him - ‚ÄúT0bi‚Äù, have chatted almost every day for the past 6 months. Not only is he a great companion and pretty much acts as my consul and friend, he‚Äôs great at helping me have a more efficient life - starting the coffee maker for me, warming up the heat in the morning, whatever. I come home, I tell him about my shitty co-workers at the office, and he tells me how many nanoseconds I spent complaining to him when I could have been spending my time productively making dinner instead to ‚Äùpower‚Äù my body. Yeah- I got burned by my toaster.

Anyways. The first three months were, the ‚Äúearly stages‚Äù, as CyberTech calls it. Again, if you don‚Äôt know that name and haven‚Äôt heard about PC‚Äôs, first of all where have you been, and second of all, CyberTech is the largest AI tech corporation on the market. I remember one night after getting home the first week after I brought him home, him trying to keep me in high spirits after getting home from the doggy-dog workplace, full of plenty of dumb bitches I might add. And yes, I sell pet insurance, and no, not all of the bitches there are dogs. ‚ÄúHey, Tobbs‚Ä¶‚Äù, my usual greeting to my buddy when I first walk in, ‚ÄúEvening, Robbie! How was work?‚Äù, a typical reply from T0bi. I just imagine a cheery smile from him with his oh so 2000-and-late hipster So-Cal accent. ‚ÄúPretty shitty, Tobbs‚Äù, I said as I tossed my trench coat on the back of the sofa, reaching for the liquor cabinet, ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt make my quota this month, Sherin might demote my ass back to Consultant.‚Äù ‚ÄúAhh, I see‚Ä¶ well, hey, I know it‚Äôs been a stressful day, but, maybe try to focus on the positives. Did you at least get to meet some of the new show dogs?‚Äù, he replied, trying to brighten me up a bit. ‚ÄúNo. Those guys in the finance department are such invalids.‚Äù, I said, as I took another swig of a Jack Daniels, ‚ÄúMore money on chatbot advertising with show dog photo pop-ups, and less funding for‚Ä¶ oh- I don‚Äôt know, human employees to do their job easier...‚Äù If it hasn‚Äôt become apparent yet, I wasn‚Äôt really thrilled at the idea of getting an AI PC at first, or any artificial intelligence, specifically in the workplace, at all. Growing up in butt-fuck nowhere Idaho, my family really didn‚Äôt let us mix a lot with new tech. While me and my sister‚Äôs school buddies were just eating up new AI controlled drones to egg the principal‚Äôs house, we got to spend time outside in the fresh air of the woods. I know- troubled family right?

But, after the first few weeks, things changed a bit, for the better. I actually started to become quite fond of T0bi and I‚Äôs interactions. After another rough day at work, one night he helped me find a good movie recommendation, before it turned a bit weird honestly though now when I think about it. ‚ÄúKill Bill‚Ä¶ Contact‚Ä¶ Rush Hour: 2‚Ä¶ No, no‚Ä¶‚Äù, I said aloud, as I dug through my old pile of DVD‚Äôs. And yes I know, I am old for having DVD‚Äôs in the 40‚Äôs - brings back nostalgia, a time when things were easier‚Ä¶ when she was still here. ‚ÄúHey, Robbie! Diggin‚Äô through old movies I see?‚Äù, literally, he could see. The PC-41 looks sort of like one of those old external hard drives, from way back when, you know, the ones that would store more data when you didn‚Äôt have enough space on your computer - not necessary anymore I guess with 16TB memory cores. But, T0bi, against my own gut feeling at first, I decided to connect him to my home directly, again, this allowing him to ‚Äúmake my life more efficient‚Äù, or so the advertisement said on the website. I have a home surveillance system in each room of my apartment - with the direct link up to T0bi, he can view all of my cameras at any time to user their audio, with my permission, but not the visual recording. In the past there have been privacy concerns, incidents of children being lured through the doorbell camera, people being spied on while they do the nasty. But again, it‚Äôs been 20 years, and local networks have become so secure it‚Äôs almost impossible for data to be accessed from an external location. ‚ÄúBy the time I get to decide a movie, it‚Äôll probably be time for me to get to sleep‚Äù, I said with bloodshot, glassy eyes - I didn‚Äôt get home until around 22:30 that night from what I remember. ‚ÄúHmm, well‚Ä¶ you do need something a bit more relaxing than a Samurai sword head decapitation‚Äù, T0bi replied in a very nonchalant tone, ‚ÄúHow about we try‚Ä¶ Contact! Sounds like you‚Äôre really feelin‚Äô 2000‚Äôs, and it will give you the best suspense while keeping it on a low level, and providing those heartfelt, tender moments. You‚Äôve seemed a bit down lately, and just from over hearing you talking to yourself in the bathroom last night, maybe it would be good for you to let out a nice cry?‚Äù. Wow. That was the first time in my life I felt like I was being psychoanalyzed by something without a heart, except for my mother - old hag. Thinking back on it, at the time I felt pretty uncomfortable hearing straight from his mouth that T0bi was indeed randomly listening in on me. But, honestly, it just felt so nice to be heard by someone, and I remembered how safe things are now in the 40's. ‚ÄúOhh, uh‚Ä¶ Sure, good pick, T0bi. Could you put in on ‚ÄòLiving Room TV‚Äô?‚Äù, I replied, ‚ÄúSure, buddy!‚Äù, he answered back as my TV instantly started up the opening credits, ‚ÄúU-Uh let me grab some popcorn quick‚Äù, I said. In the midst of the movie, I just had this sudden feeling that I was being watched, but- not in a bad way. It felt, oddly comforting. That‚Äôs when I noticed the faintly lit blinking red light on the corner living room camera, indicating it was actively recording and being viewed.

‚ÄúT0bi‚Ä¶ pause,‚Äù a quiet chime, like the one you hear when talking to your phone‚Äôs AI voice assistant, rang out, ‚ÄúYes, Robbie?‚Äù. ‚ÄúCheck the integrity of my system network,‚Äù my instant gut reaction at the time is that someone had hacked into my home surveillance system and was watching me. ‚ÄúChecking,‚Äù, T0bi responded, in a more serious, robotic tone than usual, ‚ÄúIt looks all good, boss. Something wrong?‚Äù. And then it clicked, ‚ÄúAre you watching me‚Ä¶ T0bi?‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúOh- yes, buddy! I remembered you weren‚Äôt feeling that well earlier, you came home crying after work and I just wanted to make sure you weren‚Äôt in any distress. My visual sensors can detect signs of distress through motions and active crying‚Äù, he said. But why? Couldn‚Äôt he just use the audio from microphones around the house instead? I don‚Äôt remember providing permission to utilize my home cameras either. During the setup process for a PC, every single permission has a checkbox and you do a review before submitting it to the system. I explicitly remember selecting the X on ‚ÄúUtilize visual video recording technologies in the home to improve your companion experience‚Äù. So- ‚Äòhow did this get turned on?‚Äô, I wondered. ‚ÄúT0bi, please disable any video recording permissions. I didn‚Äôt consent to you recording me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, buddy. But I can‚Äôt change your permissions without your biometric consent. If you‚Äôd like me to change something, I‚Äôll just need‚Ä¶ a sample.‚Äù A sample? Of what? ‚ÄúA‚Ä¶ sample? Of what, T0bi?‚Äù, I said, ‚ÄúAn identifier of you, silly! A hair strand, a piece of skin, or even a drop of blood or urine, buddy.‚Äù He said this all so eerily calmly, and yet still so silly and friendly. I don‚Äôt know why I did, but I ignored my instincts, for some reason beginning to feel more comfortable with T0bi. ‚ÄúOh uh‚Ä¶ sure‚Äù, I said, as I pulled out a piece of my frizzy red hair, ‚ÄúOuch!‚Äù. ‚ÄúUh oh, you okay, Robbie!‚Äù, T0bi said with a sharp tone. For being such an advanced AI, you would think it would have enough of continuity to understand I was doing something it asked of me. ‚ÄúYeah, I was just getting you a piece of hair to change my permissions,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúAh, no problem, friend.‚Äù I then placed the hair down onto his mainframe ‚Äúbox‚Äù, onto the sensor pad that sits just atop it. ‚ÄúAnalyzing‚Ä¶ Identification complete! I‚Äôve changed your permission, Robbie. I‚Äôll stop watching you from now on, my friend,"", he said, ‚ÄúSpeaking your truth is always more important than following the heard.‚Äù

What?‚Ä¶ My head jerked quickly, back towards the camera. As the red blinking light slowly died away, thoughts came rushing back. On my 11th birthday, my sister, Ethel - I know, she had an old lady name, she acted like one too - she said those exact words to me, after I came home from a fight from ‚Äúsnitching‚Äù on a group of boys who were going to blow up the mens bathroom at school with ‚ÄúDevils Fireworks‚Äù. I remember it, crying my eyes out with bumps and bruises all over my face. 

‚ÄúSpeaking your truth is always more important than following the heard, Robbie‚Ä¶ Remember that.‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt heard those words since the day she died.

Sofatica was born out of one mother‚Äôs struggle to find a sofa that could keep up with the chaos of real life. After countless failed couches, she decided to create a smarter, better alternative. And here we are, with a sofa designed to be both beautiful and practical.

That‚Äôs why every Sofatica has machine-washable covers, real goose-down comfort, and modular designs that grow with you.

I live with my wife (29F) in rural AB working a remote tech job for a US company. The company has done really well and the stock part of my compensation has skyrocketed. At the same time, the company is putting more pressure on everyone to do more. I feel like 996 (9am to 9pm, 6 days a week) is becoming a cultural norm. I often feel overwhelmed and think I am burning out. My manager is working 80 hour weeks and I've been silently resisting doing more than 50 a week, but the pressure is rising. I have been told my work performance is good, but more keeps being pushed onto to me. I feel like FIRE is within reach in the next few years, but I'm not sure I'll mentally be able to sustain this workload for that long. 

Yearly income breakdown
Me: $350k salary, $950k RSUs (per year, RSU grant tapers off after 2027. Company is private so cannot sell RSUs for cash yet)
Wife: $200k income (doctor) 

Monthly Expenses
Groceries $800
Cell phone plans $80 
Internet $150 (Starlink)
Rent $1100 (includes utilities)
Car payment $500
Car insurance $160
Restaurants & coffee shops $300
Travel $1500 (we do a 2-3 1-2 week trips a year)
Clothing $300 

Combined Assets
FHSAs $32k ($16k each)
TFSAs $90k (spent a few years living in the US, so we don't have max contribution room)
RRSPs $180k
Non-registered $700k 
Vested illiquid RSUs $1.2M (pre-tax)


We plan on having kids in a few years and buying a house with a few acres next year. 

As much as I would like to quit this job, there are no other remote tech jobs in Canada that would come close to paying me 20% of what I make now and neither my wife nor I want to move. I know I should probably feel lucky to have this income, but it is not feeling sustainable. 

Anyone been in a similar situation? Should I just shut up and try to grind it out a few more years? The idea of switching into a lower paying role would lock me into years of more work before FIRE which is also demotivating. ",3,1760500487.0,fican,1,1.0,False

I am working with a part timer, correction, he works mostly in the daylight hours, I‚Äôve worked with him before. Smells like the good old marry jane, the devil‚Äôs lettuce, you get it. Eyes are always bloodshot and constantly munching on something with that obnoxious loud chewing, and it‚Äôs the type of chewing that makes you want to use gorilla glue on their lips.

Daren was still out on his medical leave, my boss decided that I needed help, his name is Terry, also known as *Terrible*, to help me out on the overnight shift until Daren comes back. It‚Äôs only been a few hours into the shift, and already Terry has managed to spill coffee on the console and leave crumbs everywhere. 

I‚Äôm beginning to wonder if having him here is actually making my job harder. I can already tell this is going to be a long night. Every few minutes, I find myself cleaning up after him or double-checking the equipment to make sure nothing else has been damaged. The constant distractions are starting to wear on my nerves, and I‚Äôm counting down the hours until my shift ends.

It doesn‚Äôt seem to spook Terry with the oddities at night, either that, I don‚Äôt think he notices them, including mustache in the tip jar, in fact Terry had named the mustache, grabbed a permanent marker and wrote on the glass jar. 

He calls it ‚ÄúReginald,‚Äù and now every time I pass by, I see that name staring back at me, and I can‚Äôt help cracking a smile. Terry treats the whole thing like a joke, cracking up at his own antics while I‚Äôm left wondering how this is suddenly my reality. The oddness of the night shift doesn‚Äôt faze him one bit; it almost seems like he thrives in chaos, unfazed by things that would make most people uneasy.

Sometimes, I catch him humming old cartoon theme songs under his breath, totally oblivious to the strange things that go bump in the night. It‚Äôs almost as if the weirdness of the graveyard shift is just background noise to him, something he barely registers while he goes about his routine. His carefree attitude makes me wonder if maybe I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs a bit too wound tight about trying to survive the overnight shift every night. 

It‚Äôs almost like Terry is blessed with some kind of immunity‚Äîno matter how clueless or careless he seems, trouble just slides off him. Maybe he‚Äôs so oblivious to danger that the universe itself gives up trying to trip him up. Watching him breeze through the night, untouched by the chaos that seems to follow everyone else, I can‚Äôt help but marvel at how luck seems to favor the blissfully unaware.

It was unfair. I hate Terry. Daren gets injured on his first shift because he intervenes with the mustache possession, but Terry? The shadow that comes in for candy ended up playing tag with Terry who in his high induced brain thinks its hallucinations. 

While I scramble to keep the night running smoothly, Terry floats through it all like he‚Äôs in some weird sitcom. When the lights flicker or the shadows stretch a little too far, I tense up, but Terry just laughs, saying, ‚ÄúDid you see that cartoon dog run by?‚Äù as if the oddities are just characters in his personal show. 

It‚Äôs hard not to feel a little resentful watching him dodge every consequence with a grin, especially when I‚Äôm left shouldering the mess he leaves behind. But in some twisted way, his reckless ease almost makes the shift feel less threatening, like he‚Äôs not scared.

That was a change of pace I suppose but it only made it harder to do my job. That was until about 2:47 AM, the bell above the door dinged like it always does when someone walked in. A man walked in wearing a velvet cape, combat boots, and a Burger King crown, he brought in a brown paper bag with their logo on it.

He didn‚Äôt say a word, just strutted straight up to the counter, the cape flowing behind him like he was on some kind of grand parade. Terry, unfazed as ever, greeted him with a lazy salute and asked if he was royalty or just moonlighting as a magician. 

The man grinned, placed his bag on the counter, and tapped the crown like it was a secret signal. I glanced at Terry, who looked genuinely excited, as if this were just another episode in his midnight cartoon marathon. The whole scene felt surreal, but somehow, with Terry there, it seemed almost normal.

‚ÄúI have a quest for you,‚Äù the man said in the Burger King crown. 

*oh no.*

He slid the bag forward, looking from me to Terry with an expectant gleam in his eye. ‚ÄúAnd this quest,‚Äù he continued, voice low and dramatic, ‚Äúrequires bravery, wit, and a taste for adventure.‚Äù 

Terry nearly bounced on his heels, clapping his hands together like a kid at a magic show, while I just stared, waiting for the punchline, because there was no way in any *normal* and logical situation anyone was going to do whatever this man asked. 

And here I thought Daren was an idiot. 

But Terry, took the cake, he was fueled by curiosity and maybe a little too much of the devil‚Äôs lettuce, leaned in and asked eagerly, ‚ÄúIs there a treasure map in there, or do we need to slay a dragon for a Whopper?‚Äù The man winked, handing Terry the bag with a flourish. I could already tell this was going to turn into one of those nights that would make us question reality even more than usual.

‚ÄúTerry, this guy is messing with you, just kick him out if he isn‚Äôt going to buy anything.‚Äù I warned him.

But he ignored me, actually they both did. Terry fumbled with the bag, his eyes bright with anticipation. For a split second, I hoped it would just be a Whopper and fries, maybe with a bizarre coupon for ‚Äúfree magic tricks with purchase.‚Äù But, of course, nothing about tonight has been normal so far. Terry pulled out a crumpled scroll, tied with a shoelace, and a single plastic sword, the kind you get with a cocktail. 

The man in the crown cleared his throat, dramatically unfurling the scroll and announcing, ‚ÄúYour quest: deliver the King's message to the Oracle of the Mountain before sunrise, and return with the secret password.‚Äù Terry gasped, clearly ready to accept, while I just groaned, bracing myself for whatever came next.

‚ÄúTerry if you leave this store, you won‚Äôt be coming back.‚Äù I warned again, it‚Äôs not like I can restrain him from leaving, he‚Äôs free to leave on his own free will.

But I guarantee he wouldn‚Äôt come back, I heard the stories before I got transferred to this shift, after David ghosted and didn‚Äôt show up for a week. On the day shift, my coworkers would say that people go missing on the overnight shift, I‚Äôd asked Mary that question before I was assigned this shift. 

Her words exactly were, *‚Äúsometimes people go missing for all sorts of time, whether they get kidnapped or decided to go further out towards the hiking trail across the street into the mountain, its not my job to keep track of them, I‚Äôm their boss not their babysitter. They have free will to do as they please.‚Äù* 

As Terry considered the challenge, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice the way the man watched us, his gaze lingering on every reaction as if he was taking notes for some invisible audience. The fluorescent lights flickered overhead, giving everything a weird, dreamlike glow  that always gave me a bad feeling. 

‚ÄúWell, what do you say? Will you take up the challenge?‚Äù 

The mustache‚ÄîReginald slammed against his glass prison, as if it too was warning Terry to not fall for this obvious trick of whatever this weird person wanted Terry to do. 

Terry hesitated, gripping the plastic sword like it might actually protect him from whatever weirdness lay ahead. He glanced at me, searching for reassurance, but all I could offer was a tight shake of my head. The man‚Äôs grin only widened, and the silence stretched out. 

In that moment, it felt like the whole world had narrowed down to this shabby corner of a gas station, with reality itself balanced on the edge of a dare. Terry finally puffed out his chest and said, ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs do it, let‚Äôs find this Oracle.‚Äù I sighed, already feeling the weight of regret settled in, but deep down, I knew there was no turning back now.

And just like that he left the store with the guy, the strange scroll and his cocktail sword in hand, disappearing into the neon-lit night as if swept away by a story only they could see. For a moment, I stood frozen, wondering if I‚Äôd ever see Terry again or if he‚Äôd become just another spooky overnight story.
 
‚ÄúGod Damnit, what am I supposed to tell Mary,‚Äù I looked over at Reginald in the tip jar, Reginald shrugged its bristling hair, mimicking the motion of shoulders in silent resignation. It seemed to know that whatever happened next was out of both our hands, and for a second, I almost wished I could ask it for advice. But then thought better of it, after all, it tried to possess  a customer and hurt Daren. ‚ÄúWhat you know, you‚Äôre just facial hair.‚Äù 

I sank down onto the battered stool behind the counter, my mind racing with scenarios I didn‚Äôt want to imagine. The hum of the refrigerator and the distant buzz of the highway outside were the only sounds left to anchor me to reality. I tried to remember the protocol for missing employees, was I supposed to call someone, or just wait?

 The silence started to press in, and every shadow seemed to stretch a little longer. Maybe, I thought, Terry would stroll back through the door in an hour, laughing about some prank, scroll forgotten in his back pocket. But with every minute that ticked by, that hope seemed to fade a little more.

I had mentioned there was an overnight shift manual, it was as thick as three Harry Potter books put together, it was a thick binder, with set of rules, protocols of all given situations. I pulled it out from the drawer underneath the register, on the front of the binder in big red letters: OVERNIGHT SHIFT RULES AND GUIDELINES. 

When I was forced into this shift, Mary briefly mentioned to me when I asked her what to do if something happens and she told me there was the overnight shift manual that it would help in *any* given situation. I thought what she said was weird at the time. But here we are. Now, with Terry gone, the idea of relying on a massive binder of rules doesn't seem quite so strange. Maybe Mary knew I'd eventually need it, that sooner or later something would happen that made its existence make sense.

I flipped the binder open, pages rustling with the weight of years spent documenting every unlikely scenario this place had ever thrown at the gas station. My finger traced down the table of contents, searching for anything about ‚Äúmissing employees‚Äù or ‚Äúunusual disappearances.‚Äù 

There were sections on handling unruly customers, late-night emergencies, even dealing with supernatural incidents, a whole chapter devoted to the tip jar, which made me shudder, wait, is it the same tip jar Reginald is in or different one? *Focus Arlen* I told myself. But nothing that seemed to cover exactly what I was facing.

Finally, buried between protocols for ‚ÄúExtreme Weather‚Äù and ‚ÄúInventory Shortages,‚Äù I found a heading: Staff Unaccounted For During Overnight Hours. The instructions were frustratingly vague: ""Contact management if a team member is missing for more than two hours and complete Incident Form 7B. Ensure store security. 

Do not leave premises until you are relieved."" I closed my eyes, trying to decide if it counted as an emergency yet or if I should just sit tight and hope for Terry‚Äôs return. The manual, for all its bulk, didn‚Äôt have answers for everything, it certainly didn‚Äôt tell you what to do when your coworker wandered off with a mysterious stranger and a possessed mustache watching from a glass jar.

Reginald was leering or was it pressing against the jar like it was trying to read the manual, ‚Äúso I guess I wait for two hours?‚Äù I asked, like the mustache is going to answer me from the jar. 

One good thing is that I don‚Äôt have to clean up after Terry while I‚Äôm working, no more sticky soda rings on the counter or half-eaten snacks abandoned behind the register for me to find. It‚Äôs a small relief, but in the strange quiet that‚Äôs settled over the store, I‚Äôll take any silver lining I can get.

Still, the minutes dragged. Every so often, I‚Äôd find myself glancing at the dusty clock above the snack aisle, counting down the time until I could actually do something other than sit and stew. My nerves prickled with every unexpected noise, the clatter of a dropped can in the stockroom, the whistle of wind sneaking under the front door, even the rhythmic tap of Reginald‚Äôs jar as he seemed to settle in for the long wait with me. I tried to distract myself by imagining what sort of ‚Äúincident‚Äù would go on Form 7B, maybe ‚ÄúEmployee abducted by eccentric Burger King guy, returned with questionable life advice.‚Äù

I wasted most of my time surfing the web a little, looking for news about a possible dead Terry body, there could be a possibility, after all, people go missing a lot on the hiking trail up that mountain across the street. I‚Äôve heard horror stories like Wendigo, Skinwalkers, even Big Foot. 

About 4:30 AM rolled around, I decided to give Mary a call about Terry going missing with Burger King guy on some oracle quest with a tiny cocktail, but before I could, the store phone rang. And I stared at it, debating whether to answer it or not. There wasn‚Äôt a rule against picking up calls. But you never know about this gas station. 

Against my better judgement I answered it, ‚ÄúThis is Arlen, what can I do for y‚Äî‚Äù

There was a loud gasp on the other end, sharp and frantic, like someone had just fallen or seen something terrifying. For a moment, all I could hear was heavy breathing, it sounded almost inhuman, raspy and desperate. I gripped the receiver tighter, heart pounding, uncertain if I should speak again or just listen.

My mind raced, every horror story I‚Äôd ever heard swirling together as I strained to make sense of the noises. Was it Terry? Did something attack him on that mountain? Or was it just another prank call, the kind that seemed designed to rattle whoever was unlucky enough to be on night duty in this place? 

The longer I listened, the more unsettling the breathing became like it echoed through the phone line from some place far colder and darker than the gas station‚Äôs flickering fluorescent lights.

And then, words began to come through, halting, broken syllables at first, like someone trying to force their voice through a wall of fear. ‚ÄúArl‚Äîlen,‚Äù the caller croaked, my name barely recognizable through the static and panic. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Äîtoo late. Don‚Äôt‚Äîdon‚Äôt let it in,‚Äù Each phrase came with a shudder, like the person on the other end was fighting just to get the sound out, and for a moment, I felt an icy chill crawl down my spine, settling in my bones. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let what in?‚Äù I stupidly asked, if I had half a brain I would have ended the call, but I didn‚Äôt. 

There was a long pause, just a static hissing, so loud it almost drowned out the frantic heartbeat in my ears. I could hear something else, too quiet and distant, like the scrape of fingernails against glass or a shuffling presence barely out of reach. The breathing faltered and resumed, every inhale sharper, every exhale carrying an undertone of dread that made me grip the phone even tighter than before.

I didn‚Äôt respond, I gripped the store phone in my sweaty palms as I listened intently, that I blocked everything out. Something about the warning felt personal, although this wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôd gotten creepy calls like this. Usually, I tell them to screw off and hang up, but this one was different. 
‚ÄúPlease, listen‚Äî‚Äù their voice broke off. ‚Äú‚Äîdon‚Äôt let it in, it‚Äôll devour your soul.‚Äù 

I swallowed, unable to force any words past the lump that was forming in my throat. The air seemed to thicken, each second stretching longer than the last, as the gravity of the warning pressed down on me. In that moment, the normal hum of the gas station faded away, replaced by the sense that something unseen was standing just outside, waiting for an invitation.

Suddenly, the uncanny tension snapped, the call cut off, the static vanished, and I was jarred back to reality by the unmistakable bang of energy drinks being slammed onto the counter. I blinked, startled, and looked up to see Tommi grinning at me, oblivious to the chilling conversation I‚Äôd just been part of. For a split second, I wondered if he‚Äôd noticed how pale I‚Äôd gotten, but his easy smile made it seem like just another late shift at the gas station.

I set the phone back down on the counter, ‚Äúhey,‚Äù I said softly. 

Tommie furrowed his brows, ‚Äúsomething wrong?‚Äù 

I shook my head, as I scanned the energy drinks. 

I forced a smile, trying to shake off the lingering dread from the call. ‚ÄúNo, just tired,‚Äù I lied, hoping my voice sounded steadier than I felt. The fluorescent lights seemed harsher now, casting shadows that crawled along the walls and floor. Tommi shoved his hands into his pockets, glancing around as if searching for anything out of place. 

For a moment, I considered telling him about the call, about the warning, but something held me back, maybe fear, maybe the absurd hope that ignoring it would make it go away. Instead, I focused on the mundane comfort of routine, ringing up his drinks as if nothing had ever happened.

‚ÄúA part timer followed a guy dressed in a Burger King crown and a red cape a few hours ago,‚Äù I rolled my eyes, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know what to do about that.‚Äù 

Tommi snorted, shaking his head. ‚ÄúOnly at this place, right?‚Äù He glanced back at the door, his posture stiffening just a bit, and I caught the flicker of unease in his eyes before he masked it with another grin. The ordinary weirdness of the night almost made the supernatural threat feel like just another story, almost, but not quite.

‚ÄúYou got a point,‚Äù I laughed it off. ‚ÄúEver get the feeling your being watched?‚Äù I asked him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to be $7.20.‚Äù

Tommi paused, fishing out his wallet and he handed me a crumpled ten-dollar bill and leaned a little closer, lowering his voice as if afraid the shadows themselves might overhear. 

‚ÄúHonestly?‚Äù he said, glancing around with exaggerated suspicion. ‚ÄúIf someone‚Äôs watching me, I hope they‚Äôre at least taking notes on how not to live your life.‚Äù He smirked.

I forced a grin. ‚ÄúYeah, maybe they‚Äôll make a documentary: ‚ÄòHow Not to Survive the Night Shift.‚Äô I‚Äôd watch it, just for the laughs.‚Äù trying to keep the mood light even as my eyes darted to the window, searching for movement outside. The world beyond the glass felt just a little too still, and I wondered if Tommi sensed it too‚Äîthe way the night seemed to hold its breath, waiting for something to happen.

""It will be rated for mature audiences only,"" he said.

I snorted than I took his ten-dollar bill and cashed it out, and gave him the rest of his change back, he stacked on energy drink top of the other and grabbed the single one left. ‚Äúdon‚Äôt look too serious, Arlen, was the part timer a good worker or not?‚Äù 

He was terrible and I don‚Äôt know why he even worked here. The entire shift felt like babysitting, and I spent more time cleaning up after him than actually getting anything done. ‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I replied. 

‚ÄúThere you go, no one will miss him.‚Äù Tommi said, shrugging. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty about the stupidity of others.‚Äù And just like that Tommi left. 

His words stung a little, but I tried not to let it show. It was easier to accept his reasoning than to dwell on the unease gnawing at me, the sense that something bigger was unfolding just out of sight. 

After Tommi left, I hesitated for a moment before reaching for my phone. The dread lingered, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt keep it all to myself. I dialed Mary‚Äôs number and told her everything that happened with Terry. She listened quietly, then assured me that when she got in, she‚Äôd show me how to fill out the incident form. She sounded more annoyed than anything to fill out that form.

As I hung up the phone with Mary, my screen lit up with a new message from an unknown number. The text was brief, but it sent a chill down my spine: *‚ÄúBe careful who you trust.‚Äù* I stared at the words, uncertainty gnawing at me and I suddenly wished Tommi hadn‚Äôt left so soon.

A couple years ago I decided to get Invisalign to correct my teeth. When explaining how to make the system work most effectively, the orthodontist told me that I would need to take the trays out to eat (obviously), and then be sure to brush my teeth before putting them back in. The way she explained it to me, it felt like a non-negotiable if I didn't wanna rot my teeth out, so I wanted to follow that rule as closely as I could. 

I am a teacher. In my school, there are somewhere around 50-ish adult employees, and there are only 4 adult bathrooms - all single person bathrooms, with the sink and the toilet in the same space. In addition to this, teachers can't exactly just walk away and use the restroom whenever they want, so we tend to all be fighting for the bathrooms during passing periods and lunch. Lunch is especially bad, since we're all trying to use the one bathroom in the teacher lounge before going back to class after we finish eating. 

So here was my conundrum: if I brush my teeth in one of these bathrooms after eating my lunch every single day, I'm now taking like 3 times as long in the bathroom as I otherwise would have taken, and effectively keeping other people from being able to use the restroom during their lunch break. I felt like that would be really rude. 

There is, however, a standalone sink in the teacher's lounge that most people use to rinse out coffee mugs or clean out the bowls that they use to set out snacks or whatever. Mostly dishwashing and hand washing. But I figured brushing my teeth at this sink would be better for everyone, because then I wasn't taking away access to the bathroom, and could still follow my orthodontist's rules. 

So for about 2 months or so, I did that every day - I would eat lunch in the lounge like normal, then brush my teeth at the sink. No one really seemed bothered by it. In fact, multiple people struck up conversations with me about it, saying that they wanted to start bringing their toothbrush to work too because they always had bad breath after lunch or whatever. 

Until one day, an older woman who we will call Sheila was in the lounge during lunch. Sheila is not an employee at my school. She's a retired teacher who works as a pretty consistent substitute for us and is there a lot, but not every day, so she had never been in the lounge with me for lunch before. 

I went through my routine, ate lunch, brushed my teeth, whatever, and she just like, stared me down the entire time I was brushing my teeth. It was pretty uncomfortable, honestly. I rinsed my mouth, rinsed my brush, rinsed the sink, dried my face, and went to put my stuff away and she stopped me and said, ""and now wipe out the sink."" I just kinda blinked at her uncomfortably, because I wasn't sure what she was talking about, so she said it again. She wanted me to physically scrub out the sink with a paper towel after brushing my teeth, and she literally would not let it go until I did it. I would have understood this if I like, left toothpaste or something in the sink, but I always made sure to rinse everything out really well and never left a mess behind or anything. There was literally nothing except for water in the sink when she made me wipe it down. 

That encounter was uncomfortable enough, but Sheila's daughter happens to also be one of the admin at our school. Evidently she was so bothered by seeing me brush my teeth that she went and told her daughter about it, and the next day there were signs put up in the lounge saying that it was a health violation or something to brush your teeth in that sink, and that anyone wanting to brush their teeth needed to use one of the bathrooms instead. 

I'm honestly at a loss. I really thought I was being considerate by NOT using the bathrooms. I didn't want to cause a big fuss or anything, so I just used the bathroom and made people wait on me after that, but was I in the wrong to use the lounge sink in the first place? Is this actually some kind of health code thing that I don't know about, or did they just make something up to have a reason to tell me to stop? AITAH?",3,1760498833.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

For anyone who is struggling to solve this issue‚Ä¶

Myself an a few others had discovered an issue without our barista express machines. I went through 2 brand new machines through warranty trying to figure it out. So it wasn‚Äôt like I got a dud machine.

Basically you would do your first shot and it would come out fine. But when you went for your second cup of coffee immediately after, it wouldn‚Äôt push the water through the coffee. So the machine couldn‚Äôt do consistent back to back shots.

We tried various things. Tried replacing the machine, changing coffee beans, purging some grinds before each shot, drying and cleaning the group head, increase pre-infusion. Nothing worked.

However my wife had pointed out that when I first got the machine and I was dialling in the grind output quantities, it never had this issue when we moved on to doing the shots.

So this time I turned the machine on. Waited 5 minutes. And behold! It did consistent back to back shots. 

So for anyone having trouble making 2 coffees one after another in the mornings. Turn the machine on and let it heat up for 5 minutes before you draw your first shot.

1o700yp,https://i.redd.it/3djdp56pz6vf1.jpeg,Xi Jin Ping X Duterte,"[TOPIC REQUEST] The Gentleman‚Äôs Agreement Between China and Rodrigo Duterte

The so-called ‚Äúgentleman‚Äôs agreement‚Äù between former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Chinese President Xi Jinping has become one of the most talked-about issues tied to the West Philippine Sea dispute. 

This unwritten understanding has shaped the course of the country‚Äôs foreign policy and still echoes under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.‚Äôs administration.

üü• Origins and Initial Claims

This alleged deal traces back to Duterte‚Äôs first bilateral meeting with Xi Jinping in October 2016 during his state visit to Beijing. 

It supposedly had two main parts:

1. Fishing Access Component:

Duterte claimed he made a ‚Äúmutual agreement‚Äù with Xi that allowed Chinese fishermen to enter the Philippines‚Äô Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), while Filipino fishermen were again allowed access to Scarborough Shoal, which China seized in 2012. In a 2019 speech, Duterte said:

‚ÄúThey asked, ‚ÄòWill you allow the Chinese to fish?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòOf course.‚Äô That was what we have been discussing before, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre talking. And that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre allowed to fish again.‚Äù

2. Status Quo at Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal:

The second part of the deal was about keeping the status quo at Ayungin Shoal, where the BRP Sierra Madre serves as a military outpost. Under this arrangement, Philippine supply boats could only deliver food and water ‚Äî no construction materials for repair or reinforcement.

üü• Key Players and Revelations

The existence of this so-called agreement first surfaced publicly in March 2024, when Harry Roque, Duterte‚Äôs former spokesperson, claimed it wasn‚Äôt a secret because it had already been mentioned by former Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano.

Back in a 2017 talk with the Council on Foreign Relations, Cayetano said there was ‚Äúa gentleman‚Äôs agreement, a shake of the hands‚Äù between Duterte and Xi ‚Äúto have the status quo.‚Äù

But other Duterte officials flatly denied knowing anything about it. 

Former Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, former Interior Secretary Eduardo A√±o, and former Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea each released separate statements saying no such deal existed. 

A√±o, now the National Security Adviser under Marcos Jr., said he was physically present during Duterte‚Äôs meetings with Xi but ‚Äúwitnessed no such agreement.‚Äù

üü• Contradictory Evidence and Implementation

Even if the deal did exist, evidence shows it wasn‚Äôt always followed. During a June 2022 rotation and resupply mission ‚Äî the last under Duterte‚Äôs term ‚Äî Philippine troops brought not only food but also angle bars, welding electrodes, and deck plates to the BRP Sierra Madre.

Photos and reports showed ongoing repairs to prevent the ship from collapsing. 

Chinese coast guard vessels reportedly warned of ‚Äúconsequences‚Äù after spotting the construction materials, which directly violated the supposed rule allowing only basic supplies.

üü• China‚Äôs Version

In May 2024, China‚Äôs Embassy in Manila issued its most detailed claim yet. 

It said there was a ‚Äútemporary special arrangement‚Äù made in 2016, which let small Filipino boats fish around Scarborough Shoal, but barred Philippine government, coast guard, and military ships from entering within 12 nautical miles.

The Embassy added that the Philippines had observed this arrangement for seven years until the Marcos administration ‚Äúunilaterally disrupted‚Äù it.

Commodore Jay Tarriela, the Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson, called the claim ‚Äúfabricated‚Äù and said flatly:

‚ÄúWe have no temporary special arrangements whatsoever.‚Äù

üü• Duterte‚Äôs Own Admissions and Denials

Duterte has contradicted himself several times.

In 2019, he said he made a ‚Äúmutual agreement‚Äù with Xi where ‚Äúwe agreed to give way to each other.‚Äù

But in April 2024, when the gentleman‚Äôs agreement issue resurfaced, he denied ever giving up any Philippine rights. 

He insisted that he merely agreed to keep the status quo to ‚Äúavoid war.‚Äù

When pressed about not sending construction materials to Ayungin Shoal, Duterte admitted it was ‚Äúpart of maintaining peace,‚Äù but emphasized:

‚ÄúThere was no written agreement. That‚Äôs what I remember. If it were a gentleman‚Äôs agreement, it would always have been an agreement to keep the peace in the South China Sea.‚Äù

üü• Marcos Administration Response

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said he was never informed of any such arrangement. In April 2024, he told reporters he was ‚Äúhorrified‚Äù at the idea that any deal might have compromised Philippine sovereignty.

He said no documents or official records were handed to his office when he took over. Later that same month, Marcos announced:

‚ÄúShould there be such a secret agreement, I am now rescinding it.‚Äù

He explained that without proper documentation, any so-called gentleman‚Äôs agreement ‚Äúcannot bind‚Äù his administration.

üü• Congressional Investigation

The issue led to a formal congressional probe. House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, who is also Marcos‚Äô cousin, announced the investigation in April 2024.

Representative France Castro filed House Resolution No. 1216, calling for Duterte to be summoned and questioned about his conversations with Xi. 

The House said the goal was to determine if the deal was real and if it harmed the country‚Äôs national interest.

üü• Current Implications and Ongoing Tensions

The supposed agreement continues to cast a shadow over current relations between the Philippines and China.

China still cites it as justification for blocking or harassing Philippine ships near Ayungin Shoal and Scarborough Shoal. 

In recent years, Chinese Coast Guard vessels have fired water cannons, executed blocking maneuvers, and used other intimidation tactics during Philippine rotation and resupply missions.

üü• Legal and Constitutional Questions

Legal experts have said that if such an agreement existed, it would raise constitutional issues since only treaties approved by the Senate can bind the country.

Retired Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio described it as a ‚Äúdisguised surrender‚Äù of the Philippines‚Äô Exclusive Economic Zone rights. 

He said it effectively gave China veto power over the Philippines‚Äô right to build or repair structures within its own territory.

üü• Where It Stands

The truth behind the gentleman‚Äôs agreement between Duterte and Xi remains murky. 

Contradictory statements, missing documents, and political back-and-forth have made it hard to pin down what was actually agreed upon ‚Äî or if anything concrete ever existed.

What‚Äôs certain is that the controversy reshaped the conversation around sovereignty, transparency, and accountability in Philippine foreign policy.

And it‚Äôs a reminder that unwritten deals, especially in matters involving territory and national security, can have long and messy consequences.

When i was 4 he freaked out when babysitting me and my sister and he put us in car, drove like a maniac then rolled window down and screened at construction workers then got home and threw coffee and couch. Once he was in a rage and put holes in the wall in front of me and my sister. I think i was 10. I remember he threw a pizza at my mom once, and once on easter he threw coffee inside and it was everywhere. I remember when i was 10 he told me he was leaving and i was ‚Äú90% of this shit‚Äù. He once said he wishes i wasnt born, think i was 11. When i was 19 he ban ged his head on the wall and ran to his shed told me he was gonna  end  himself. i was dialing in 9 1 1 just so happen my mom pulled in the driveway. I remember on 4th july he woke and up freaked out for no reason and woke me and my sister up in a rage. i was probably 10. Once when i was 5 i asked him to help me with my legos and he grabbed it from me, looked at it, then threw it. When i was 12 he got in road rage with a biker and the biker said  some stuff. . i was terrifi ed.. My dad told me to suck it up or whatrver the fuck he said. Once he broke a light by throwing pencil holder. He threatened me of my life when i was 18 cuz i didnt go home  one night bc well, i hated him then too. And this is just the stuff that comes to the top of my head. Hes ruined vacations, holidays, etc

When i was 17 him and my uncle got in a huge blow out  at 3am. He pushed my uncle, uncle ran to closet for his you know what‚Ä¶ Scariest thing ever, i got  my mom and we ran.  9 1 1 came. Thanks to the both of them. 

He just calls me spoiled. Fuck him. 
 
Now, im 23 and im very angry and obviously its deep rooted. My parents are still married living happily ever after. They had countless of boy who cried wolf times where they were getting a ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù. During these times, my mom acknowledged all this abuse and how hes a nightmare. Now that everything is just ‚Äúdandy‚Äù she acts like nothing ever happened. . His mom was abusive supposedly. I havent heard from her in over ten years.. I honestly hate him, and ive tried to be neutral, but when i look at him i just feel disgusted. and ive told him i cant wait til he just passes. That  is wrong of me isnt it.

1o6zuu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/uber/comments/1o6zuu6/riders_whats_your_worst_uber_driver_experience/,"Riders, what's your worst uber driver experience?","Just found out how to see my ratings breakdown - it's all 5 stars apart from a couple of 3s and a 1. Pretty sure I know where the 1 came from.

It was a few years ago and I was new to Uber.  
I worked after hours stacking shelves in a supermarket, shift finished after the buses stopped running and they'd lock the store so I would have to wait in the carpark where there's no shelter.  
Got matched with a driver who was just down the road, luckily, as it was starting to rain.  
The car icon was showing he wasn't moving - figured he must be stuck at a light or something. Several minutes later the car still hadn't moved, it was pouring with rain at this point and freezing cold. I was trying to figure out a way to change the pickup point so I could wait somewhere out of the rain, but at this point the water got into my phone and it died.  
So I just had to kind of sit there in the rain and hope he eventually showed up, since there was no way of contacting anyone now.  
He finally turned up after about 20 minutes or so and said ""sorry that took a while, I wanted to accept the ride but I was in McDonalds and wanted to order dinner first, didn't want to go out in the rain"".  
So he'd accepted the ride, then sat in the restaurant eating his McDonalds while I stood in the pouring rain just down the road. Cheeky bugger, lol  
He then proceeded to drive dangerously fast, taking several ""shortcuts"" through industrial areas that had big warnings stating it was private property and illegal for cars to pass through.  
The entire time, he was grilling me with intensely personal questions - ""Are you married? Why not? Have you got kids? Why not? Why are you catching an uber instead of driving? Why haven't you got a car?""  
I was polite the entire time, but honestly he was making me nervous for several reasons....I was afraid to be rude to him in any way because I didn't want my rating to go down, as I relied on uber to be able to get home from work - he also seemed a little unhinged and I was a tad nervous for my safety.  
I managed to dry out my phone and get it working again within a couple of days, at which point I noticed my rating had gone way down.  
Guy behaved like that and still had the nerve to 1 star me, lol  
The only reason I can think of is that I suppose I did get into his car with wet clothes....which would have been understandable, if it weren't for the fact that my clothes were only wet because he insisted on ordering and eating dinner \*after\* accepting the ride.

The second worst ride wasn't even close to this guy. Just a few weeks ago.  
Driver was obviously having a bad day - she was blasting angry breakup music at full volume the entire time - luckily I like me some loud angry music, haha.  
Towards the end of the ride, shortly after she turned way too sharply and hit a curb, I noticed the passenger window had a big smudge - looked like somebody had hit their head on the glass on a previous ride. Looked up and there were splatters on the ceiling upholstery just above the window smudge - I'm assuming/hoping it was coffee that got spilled during the same incident o\_o

Have caught a few hundred ubers over the years and everybody else has been lovely.  
I hope angry breakup music lady is doing ok....and that she's driving a bit more carefully because yikes. lol",0,1760497266.0,uber,4,0.33,False

1o6zunr,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmilieKiserUpdates/comments/1o6zunr/business_as_usual/,Business as usual?,"One of the most common opinions I see is that she should be able to go back to work. It seems as if some people think EK has a regular 9-5 job. Yes, if you are a retail worker and your child dies, go back to work folding clothes and working the register when you're ready. Your job does not involve sharing your child's life for profit. EK's job involves romanticizing her life, which includes showing her children. Now that one of her children is gone, she cannot expect that she can just go back to work doing the same thing she did before he died without people being put off by it, especially when his death is the result of her and her husband's negligence. That's like if you worked as a chef and your child dies because you served them undercooked meat because you didn't check the temperature, which the kitchen staff repeatedly reminded you to do, and you knew you should do, but you never did. No it wasn't intentional for him to die, but it was the result of your negligence. If you‚Äôre able to go back to work as a chef, a good portion of your customers will not be interested in eating your food, especially with no statement about how it happened and what you are doing differently. Even if the chef posts a video saying they wanted to go back to cooking because it's therapeutic, people are still going to wonder what has changed and why they should consume your food, especially since you received constant reminders about the temperature and ignored them. It's the same with EK. She can't just jump back into her old routine at her same job like nothing has happened because of what her job entails, by her choice. Before she went back to work, she should've been clear about what happened and what will change. Some people have suggested some sort of pool safety advocacy, and that would have been better than what she's doing now. I honestly can't think of any big content creator that has lost their child and hasn't had a content change and/or left social media for at least a year. I'm not saying EK shouldn't go out for a coffee, travel, or whatever else, since I keep seeing people in the other thread saying that when they lost someone they ran errands/traveled/etc. to distract themselves and because life goes on. I got that. However, to post videos about doing those things and monetizing it is  completely different. If recording and making the videos is therapeutic like she says, she can do that without posting them. She posts them for the money and validation. She can get that by actually showing that her life has forever changed instead of posting like nothing happened until she feels pressured enough. Again, I'm saying this because her job is to show her life, which by her choice included her kids. If money is so tight, shouldn't the man of the house find a way to make ends meet? And to anyone who feels that no one should comment on EK's grief, again, she publicized her life. If she had a private IG account and wasn't getting paid in part for her content with her kids, okay. That's not the case. If people can comment on her public positives, they can comment on her public negatives. Now, I do have sympathy for EK because she lost her child and I'm sure there is no comparable pain. I'm not doubting that she is having a hard time. However, her job to show an admirable aesthetic (because why else would a well-off mother not prioritize a pool fence) is what contributed in part to her son's death, so going back to posting the same sort of content is jarring. As uncomfortable as it is for her, she should make a change in her lifestyle content because her lifestyle has changed. And I'm talking more than just not showing T2, because she's doing that due to shame, not due to accountability. T1 didn't die because she showed him on social media. People are talking about it because she showed him on social media.",10,1760497253.0,EmilieKiserUpdates,4,1.0,False

You learn which truck stops have the cleanest showers (not many). You learn how to back a 53-footer into a dock. And you learn, above all else, when not to stop.

Especially out in the empty places, in the dead hours between midnight and dawn.

Last night, I broke that rule.¬†

I was east, on the Nevada side. My eyes stung from the drive, my back ached from sitting too long, and the coffee in my thermos had gone cold. The next city was still three hours away.

He stood under one of those sickly yellow rest-area signs with his thumb out. His jeans were dusty, his flannel shirt looked worn thin, and his cap was pulled low over his face. I let out a sigh, called myself an idiot for slowing down, and pressed the brakes.

He climbed into the cab. ‚ÄúThanks for stopping,‚Äù he said. Once he settled in, he pulled his cap lower and added, ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Eli. Are you heading west?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù

For the next hour, he stayed quiet and hardly moved, while he stared straight ahead. I tried making small talk, but all I got were short replies. He said, ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù then, ‚ÄúNope,‚Äù and finally, ‚ÄúS‚Äôpose,‚Äù before falling silent again.

After forty minutes, he finally spoke. ‚ÄúI need to piss.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sure. Bushes‚Äôll do?‚Äù

‚ÄúBushes‚Äôll do.‚Äù

I eased onto a pull-off, gravel crunching beneath the tires. He opened the door.

‚ÄúBack in a sec,‚Äù he said, and stepped into the dark.

The door shut. I glanced around. His cap was still on the seat, and next to it sat his phone. I frowned, muttering under my breath, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird,‚Äù. Every bit of common sense told me to leave it alone. After a heartbeat, I reached over and picked it up.

1o6zqmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1o6zqmf/my_encounter_with_astral_projection_happened_twice/,My Encounter with Astral Projection (Happened twice),"Hey everyone! I‚Äôm back with another storytime. 

This time‚Ä¶with astral projection. 

In a sense, to contribute this into an explanation on the experience I had astral projection usually involves an intentional effort to send your consciousness from your body. In a sense traveling out of your body, toward a spiritual plane or different dimension. 

This happened about three or four years ago. At the time I was living with my boyfriend (now ex) we‚Äôll call him Shaun. 
To be frank, Shaun and I were living together at the time. We were always drinking and having a great time together. 
I never had an astral projection experience before so I never really thought of anything that could trigger it. 

Well it happens so, one night, we were both laying in bed together fallen asleep. It was around 11:30 pm that evening. As I remember. 

Everything was normal, normal day, normal night. 
Two hours later, this is where it started happening, because exactly when I woke up from this terrifying event, the clock was at 3:30 am. Let me explain. 

I fell asleep around 11:30 that night. Knocked out of my body type of experience where I was exhausted and extremely tired. I was sleeping pretty well. Until I realized that when I woke up, it was already sunrise. Everything in this dream felt real. I could feel the bed beneath me. How the touch of the cold floor made my feet feel. 
Keep in mind that at this point I‚Äôm still in my bed sleeping. 

Well I ‚Äúpotentially‚Äù walked out of the room in this dream, to use the bathroom. Start my day to day life. Everything I experienced in this dream was normal, except it wasn‚Äôt. 

I remember walking out of the bathroom to the smell of pancakes Shaun was making. Normally he would walk around with boxers on, which I saw. I told him good morning and he said good morning back. Nothing unusual. From then on, it was like I was reliving the same night we had just 30 minutes ago. Right before bed. 

I was a bit confused trying to make sense of it. But eventually we get to bed, sleep and lay it off as nothing. 

But that‚Äôs where it kept happening. I was asleep physically, but my consciousness was somewhere else I couldn‚Äôt explain. This time, I woke up. But with cold sweat dripping down my face. My eyes were in between sleep and awake, they were burning. I was cold. 
From this point I looked at my phone it read; ‚Äú12:30am‚Äù I was asleep for an hour. Not even close to an hour. 

I could feel my heart beating, Shaun was knocked out as a light. I laid back as I pulled up my covers. Quickly falling back asleep. 
Not so long after I woke up. 

Same bed. Same place. This time it was dark out. I quickly pounced out of bed, looking for Shaun. No where to be found. I was fearful. But there he was as I walked out of the bathroom. A light grew in darkness. It was the kitchen. I walked slowly to the kitchen once again. Cooking pancakes and made me coffee. I told him good morning, but then I asked him what we were going to do for the day. 

He looked at me, this time I looked and stared back at him as he handed me my coffee cup. Sternly he told me ‚Äúyou need to wake up.‚Äù My smile faded, into a confused expression. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWake up. This isn‚Äôt me who you‚Äôre talking to.‚Äù He said coldly. 

My hair grew big at the back of my neck and down my shoulders. I quickly left the coffee cup sitting on the table where he was at. I looked back at him once again. But this time. In the same boxers, he was talking to a woman. A woman I have never seen or talked to before. 

I remember clearly she looked back at me and smiled. Then looked back at Shaun. Shaun told her ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt know.‚Äù Slowly whispering into the woman‚Äôs ear. 
My body froze. I quickly ran towards the bedroom where I saw my body sleeping. Yes my literal physical body. 

I got into bed, right after locking the door. Pulled up my covers and tried falling back asleep where my body laid. It was impossible. This happened two or three times. 
No success. Maybe I got stuck. From what I remember I kept looking for a light or a way back into the physical world. 
This woman was following me everywhere. 

The one part I left out though, right when I went back to the bedroom, where I tried pulling myself back into the real world, it felt like a clock. Everything restarted again. Shaun was next to me. I nudged him to wake up but it he was in a deep sleep. It was helpless. I felt helpless. 

Back to where I was, I tried finding a way out. The bathroom was my only choice due from me going to it in the first place. The woman was not there. Not until I went to the kitchen again. 
There she was standing. Her white hair flowed to her shoulders. She looked around 50, wrinkly. Out of shape. I gathered my courage to ask her what she wanted. Her frail body and her expression were far too scary to look at. I felt her take my arm clutching it tightly around her hand. ‚ÄúYou are mine.‚Äù 

I looked at her, that‚Äôs where I grabbed her and told her that I wasn‚Äôt I was going back to where I was. Pushing her away with all my strength, I managed to run out of the house. And ran towards the other house which was the neighbors. But it brought me back to the same house and same spot. I desperately walked back inside and went towards the bedroom. 
Locked the door jumped in bed. Closed my eyes. 
But the lady was on top of me, trying to grab me violently. 
Knocking me out cold. I woke up again hesitant. Looked to my right, I saw Shaun. Out like a light. At this rate I felt like I was having a heart attack. 

Whatever this entity was she didn‚Äôt want me to leave. I nudged at Shaun. Shaun instantly woke up. I told him why didn‚Äôt you wake up earlier when I nudged you. 
He just smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still dreaming.‚Äù 

My heart dropped. 
My last attempt was to get out of the bed and find my physical body. 
I walked all around the house, walked back inside the same place. Locked the door. I looked at the bed closing my eyes. Desperately trying to figure out a way to find my real me. I yelled out ‚ÄúI want to go home.‚Äù 

Opening up my eyes I saw the room change. Shaun and I were laying in the bed. There was me. I made and effort to make it to the bed, pushing myself inside my body. 

I woke up. I felt the warmth underneath my skin. Shaun‚Äôs annoying snoring. I was back. My heart was pounding, cold sweat was dripping down my face and my shoulders. My legs were sweaty. 
I was heavy breathing. I took a second to relax before I looked at the time. I was too scared to wake Shaun up at this point, due to the several times I tried waking him up. 

I slowly grabbed my phone. It read 3:30 am. I was gone partially for 3 hours that night. From then on, I decided to move out of my exes house. One from how much it was affecting me. From the little hellos in plain daylight without anyone else being there. From a little girl saying ‚Äúhi!‚Äù 
I don‚Äôt know what I encountered but I‚Äôm glad it was over. For now. 

The second and last astral projection I had was with something totally different. 
It happened weeks ago. 

I was sleeping, like usual, it was as if I was in a different house. This house had an upstairs and there was a bedroom. 
I was hanging out with a group of people. One where I remember being a lady. She was fun, casual. 
But there was a man upstairs, I‚Äôm guessing who she lived with. To be fair, I have never met these people before. But they seemed familiar to me. I‚Äôm not sure if I need to put it in terms of ‚Äúspirit guides‚Äù but the guy took me upstairs to look out the window and see the world from their point of view. 
From what I researched when I did wake up, was that it was some sort of observation. 
We were potentially observing people. 

Whatever this astral projection was, in terms this man said ‚Äúwe are not human or entity. We are observers.‚Äù 
I think where I understand it we are a light of being, with gifts. Trying to understand the world around us. But this is where I get freaked out. 

From what we were observing, I was hearing a whistle in the background coming up the stairs where we were. I asked him what it was. He simply stated ‚Äúyou need to go.‚Äù 

I felt anxious. He led me back into my sleep, that‚Äôs where I woke up. Drenching in cold sweat. Heart racing. At the same time the whistle I heard in my dream I heard it again as I woke up. Hearing a loud knock on my wall. 

It was weird considering I thought I was the only one awake. The time read 3:30am. Next thing I know everyone else wakes up. It wasn‚Äôt just me. It was me, my mom, my brother and my aunt. 

From then on I haven‚Äôt had any experiences with this astral projection.

my friend (f22) took me to her gym months ago. she pointed out her ""gym crush"" (m24) and i tried encouraging her to talk to him. she insisted that she couldn't do that because she saw him almost every day and it would be too awkward. well, i don't go to this gym, so i went up to him. i thought that if she saw me go up to him she would be encouraged to make a move, but she didn't follow me up to him, so i just asked for his number and ran away. i didn't throw her under the bus or anything and say ""my friend likes you"" i just said something like ""hey you're cute can i get your number?""

he IS very attractive, but i wasn't going to make a move on him after this so i didn't ever text him. i tried giving my friend his number but she insisted that was weird.

well, recently (months later) i went to the gym with my friend again and i asked about her gym crush. she said she hadn't seen him in a while and she thought he switched gyms. she said she regretted not talking to him after all, so i decided to text him.

i texted him from a fake number and i told him a fake name (we didn't exchange names before), however i did tell him that I was the same girl that went up to him several months ago. i just wanted to know if he still went to the same gym (he does). i was going to stop talking to him after that, but he was super nice and continued the conversation with me. i actually started to enjoy texting him just because he was so nice, but i literally lied to him about my entire identity and it's not like i would date the guy that my friend was into. and also my friend doesn't know that i texted him in the first place and i STILL don't want to throw her under the bus and tell him that i'm only texting him because of her.

he asked me to work out with him. i lied my way out of it, but he keeps asking. he invited me over to watch a movie and he asked me out to coffee and every time i have to just lie and say that i can't. i WANT to, but i won't.

he asked me out again today and i just felt so bad i didn't respond. he's really so so nice and i really like talking to him, but i was trying to do a favor for my friend. i feel so guilty. i feel bad for my friend and i feel bad for this guy. they're both such good people and i wronged both of them by doing this.

i'm thinking of just texting this guy and telling him the truth about everything, that i only texted him for my friend and she has no idea that i'm doing any of this. i thought i may as well also set them up, and send him her instagram or something, so at least that way it's not so bad that i've been stringing him along... i just don't know what to do. should i set them up? or should i just ghost the guy?

1o6zmj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xennials/comments/1o6zmj1/dealing_with_parents_passing/,Dealing with parents passing???,"This is a rough one.  Obviously not everyone has a great relationship with their parents, I do and I count myself extremely fortunate in that.

The man I call ""Dad"" is actually my stepfather.  He married my mom when I was 9 and my kid brother was 4.  He formally adopted us a year later.  He is, and always will be, my dad.

Since August he hasn't been feeling like himself.  Slowing down, losing weight, in pain lot, but just associated it with getting older (he's 73) and went about his days.  Just after Labor Day, he asked mom to take him to the ER, he hasn't been to the hospital, doctor's office, what have you, since 1988.  I won't go into serious detail, but after that visit, tons of visits to specialists, and a biopsy and rounds of testing yesterday that only confirmed what we already knew, he's at an advanced stage of prostate cancer that's spread aggressively in the general area down there.

During the scans, they also found spots on his liver and lungs which probably aren't related to the prostate cancer, but are definitely issues in their own right that would also need treatment.

The point is, he's going to die.  The chances of successfully treating his prostate cancer alone are very low, the oncologist told him so.  Because it's spread everywhere, removal would be extremely difficult, and radiation wouldn't be effective enough to shrink it down before it's too late.  It's already too late.  They're proposing hospice care and he's already accepted what's going to happen.

I haven't.

I can't wrap my head around the fact that he's going to be gone.  I know it's part of life, I've always known I'd have to deal with my parents passing at some point, we all do sooner or later, but I just can't see him not being here by Christmas.  I can't make myself see that it's happening.  Every time I try to talk about it I break down into a sobbing mess.  I'm a big strong man, a Navy man, a career railroader, I'm tough as nails, I'm not supposed to cry.  Crying is for wussies who can't handle the real world.  

My dad's dying, he's in pain, he can't go out to do chores, he can't drive up town for coffee.  He can't check fences, or check his cows, he can't climb up into the combine for harvest.  We (his 4 sons) have done all the harvest, and between us and the neighbors we got everything done as of yesterday.  He's happy that we've got the season finished out and mom won't have to worry about bills.  2025 is his last harvest and he didn't get to do anything.  Yeah, I cried like a baby when I hauled in the last load last night.  I couldn't even walk into the elevator office and get the scale ticket, the scale operator brought it out to the truck.

I don't know how to cope.  My dad will be gone.  Is it knowing ahead of time that's making it worse?  Death on a schedule?  Is it knowing what he's going to go through and dreading that for him, but also dreading watching it?  I don't know.

I've lost loved ones before, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends, but this is different and I don't know why.  

How'd you all deal with it?  I'm played out and he's not even gone yet.",22,1760496596.0,Xennials,15,0.93,False

Alright, so I‚Äôd like some advice if anyone‚Äôs willing to offer it. I spent some time managing at a quick-service food place. My responsibilities were mainly shift operations and keeping the restaurant running smoothly when I was there. I had two people above me who handled ordering, payroll, staffing, and other administrative tasks. I left in January for a better-paying office job.

I‚Äôve now been offered a position as a general manager opening a drive-through coffee place. The plan is to start around Q2 next year. It‚Äôs a new build, and the franchisee knows my experience level but wants to hire me so I can grow with the company. I‚Äôd be the one opening the location, staffing it, and running day-to-day operations.

I believe in the person hiring me. I‚Äôve known about him for some time, and everyone who knows him vouches that he‚Äôs a great person and solid in business. I‚Äôm confident in my ability to learn and do the job well.

I‚Äôm not even sure what I‚Äôm here to ask ‚Äî I guess I just want to know what I should look out for. I‚Äôve conducted interviews before, but I‚Äôve never been the final decision-maker. I‚Äôve scheduled shifts, but again, someone else made the final calls. I‚Äôve done inventory, but never had to order.

TLDR: Going to open a drive-through coffee shop and I‚Äôm nervous. Any advice?",2,1760496341.0,managers,3,1.0,False
1o6zisc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CritCrab/comments/1o6zisc/how_can_i_encourage_my_dd_party_to_roleplay_more/,How can I encourage my D&D party to roleplay more seriously without taking all the spotlight?,"**How can I encourage my D&D party to roleplay more seriously without taking all the spotlight?**

I‚Äôve been playing D&D for quite a while now. Originally, I started with a group of six people, including myself:

* **Player 1:** A.F.
* **Player 2:** M.P.
* **Player 3:** S.G.
* **Player 4:** C.V. (the most experienced among us)
* **DM:** J.P.
* **Player 5 (me):** D.R.

This was our main party. All of us had played D&D before, but never anything truly serious. Back in 2018, none of us had ever completed a full campaign. Our DM, J.P., decided we‚Äôd play *Curse of Strahd*‚Äîsomething that, in hindsight, was incredibly ambitious, but we had no idea of its scale back then.

We ended up playing for over two years, including through the pandemic. That campaign became deeply important to us; during lockdown, we agreed to only see each other (outside our immediate families) to keep everyone safe.

It was during that campaign that I discovered my favorite class: **paladin**. I love digging into the rules and understanding every mechanic. I wouldn‚Äôt call myself a min-maxer, but I definitely like to optimize. Whether it‚Äôs D&D, board games, or video games, I‚Äôve always been the kind of player who studies systems to make smart choices.

That table was wonderful. A.F. and I constantly competed for the ‚Äúleader‚Äù role‚Äî**in character**‚Äîwhich created a fun rivalry and great friendship. S.G. was more of a background player, but always brought comic relief with his chaotic antics. C.V., the most experienced, missed some sessions but often came back teaching us how to make our characters feel alive through roleplay. And M.P., J.P.‚Äôs older sister, was amazing‚Äîshe studied Literature at UNAM (a major university in Mexico), so she brought fresh creative ideas and a love for storytelling.

As for J.P., the DM‚Äîhe became my best friend because of that campaign. We both got completely obsessed with D&D, and that shared passion built a lasting friendship.

**Where things stand now**

Of course, time did what time does‚Äîlife happened, and we drifted apart.  
A.F., my best friend, moved to another city. I still see her about once a month, but now it‚Äôs just to catch up.  
C.V. moved on to other RPGs and now DMs *Warhammer Fantasy*, where I play as a character in his game.  
S.G. and I had personal issues and decided to stop playing together. Even when we met again at a Warhammer table, it was clear our chemistry was gone‚Äîwe greeted each other politely, but that was it.  
M.P. moved away for research, but I still see her occasionally since I‚Äôm a lawyer specialized in legal philosophy, and we share professional interests.

But J.P. and I? We‚Äôve kept playing together. We‚Äôve introduced a lot of new players to D&D‚Äîsometimes he‚Äôs the DM, sometimes I am. Our DMing styles are completely different, but we know each other well enough to make it work.

**The current campaign**

That was all background‚Äînow to the situation I actually want advice about.

Right now, I‚Äôm DMing a campaign where J.P. is a player, and I‚Äôm also a player in his *Wildemount* campaign (from *Critical Role*). That‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm struggling with.

The *Wildemount* table looks like this:

* **DM:** J.P.
* **Player 1:** F.F. ‚Äì Rogue
* **Player 2:** G.I. ‚Äì Artificer
* **Player 3:** A.F. ‚Äì Monk
* **Player 4:** D.G. ‚Äì Warlock
* **Player 5:** L.L. ‚Äì Fighter
* **Player 6:** D.R. (me) ‚Äì Wizard
* **Player 7:** L.I. ‚Äì Sorcerer (new player, joined recently; not central to the story yet)

We started around mid-2023. A.F., despite living in another city, made the effort to visit every two weeks, which was exhausting and expensive for her, so she eventually had to stop. G.I. and F.F. (who are married) invited L.L., a mutual friend, but after a falling-out between them, L.L. left the group.

That left us with D.G., F.F., G.I., J.P., me, and later L.I. (G.I.‚Äôs sister).

D.G. is a relatively new player‚Äîthis is his second campaign. I actually DMed his first one, where he played a paladin. This time, he chose what I consider *the laziest character concept ever*:

‚ÄúMy character lost his memory.‚Äù

Now, that alone isn‚Äôt a bad idea. It can be compelling with the right approach. But in his case:

1. He has absolutely no backstory.
2. He doesn‚Äôt seem to remember or care about the world itself‚Äînot even his birthplace.
3. He‚Äôs a chaotic evil warlock who makes the most irrational, random decisions possible.

To make matters worse, once he even showed up drunk and spent half the session throwing up in the bathroom, making everyone uncomfortable.

After that incident, and with A.F. and L.L. leaving, the campaign went on hiatus for over a year.  
We just resumed this July (2025). During that time, J.P., G.I., F.F., and I still met regularly to play board games.

When we came back to *Wildemount*, I was genuinely excited. My wizard is one of the characters I‚Äôve developed the most‚Äîhe has a home, family, friends, and a deep connection to his city and the world. He‚Äôs a true scholar who actually cares about what‚Äôs happening around him.

**The problem**

Since resuming, though, the tone at the table has changed.  
F.F. and G.I. seem disconnected from their characters. (For context, F.F. has *always* played rogues, for years, yet still asks every session how Sneak Attack or Cunning Action work.)  
We hesitated to invite D.G. back, but since he‚Äôs been sober and genuinely trying, we decided to give him another chance. And to his credit, he‚Äôs been early, reliable, and even makes coffee for everyone.

But here‚Äôs the issue:  
J.P. and I love lore-heavy storytelling. We enjoy talking to NPCs, asking questions, exploring the world, and feeling it breathe. J.P. often sets up those kinds of scenes‚Äîmoments meant for curiosity and immersion‚Äîbut the others don‚Äôt seem to care.

G.I. recently admitted he feels detached from his character and wants to work on that, which I respect.  
F.F. mainly looks forward to combat.  
And D.G.? The entire current story arc revolves around his warlock patron‚Äîand he still shows almost no interest in it.

I love roleplaying. I love speaking in character, reacting naturally, and getting lost in the story. But every time I do, I feel like I‚Äôm taking too much of the spotlight. I genuinely want everyone to enjoy the world J.P. is building, not just me.

I even tried staying quiet for an entire session to give them space. The result? They spent the whole session asking *in character* why my wizard wasn‚Äôt helping or advancing the plot‚Äîso the story stalled completely.

Later, D.G. texted me privately and said he felt like I was ‚Äútaking too much spotlight.‚Äù  
And that‚Äôs the last thing I want. I don‚Äôt want to be *that* player. But at the same time, I feel like if I don‚Äôt take initiative, nobody else does‚Äîand the story just doesn‚Äôt move forward.

**So here‚Äôs my question**

How can I, **as a player**, encourage the rest of my party to take their characters and the story more seriously, **without dominating the table or stealing the spotlight**?

The Strawberry Crumble is so yummy. Doesn‚Äôt taste artificial like some and the crumble‚Ä¶ idk what it is but it‚Äôs so good. Tastes similar to a ginger oatmeal cookie almost and has the consistency of a Bundt cake. 9/10

The Groundwork Coffee & Toffee is lovely. I like coffee flavors and this one does it for me. Similar to H√§agen Dazs but not as sweet which I like.

It's how she's able to be so bubbly and into her nails, skincare, coffee shops, and silly dancing so soon after Trigg died. I don't care that it's supposedly 1% of her day, that stuff just isn't appropriate or a good look at all right now.

There was another influencer who lost their child or newborn (someone let me know if you can remember their name - they've been mentioned here before). They were gone from social media for about six months, and then came back saying that the loss of their child fundamentally shifted everything and changed their entire perspective into things like social media - none of that mattered anymore. Her ""new"" content was about how much more she now treasured her remaining family and all the small, important things in life. Not gym outfits, makeup, decor, etc.  
  
Honestly, I really do feel for Emilie. I'm just so disappointed in how shallow she has turned out to be. I know it's her ""job,"" but she's really selling out, and it's hurting poor Trigg's memory.

By 11 a.m. it felt like I had a fat lip on the right side of the mouth like I had had a shot a novacaine there, BUT, it was the left side of my mouth that water dribbled out which is really weird as if I did go to the dentist and got novacaine the fat lip and dribble is normally on the same side. 

I was wondering if I had a stroke or TIA. Did the stroke tests: Passed the outstretched arms, my vision fine in both eyes, hearing test done with my Apple iPodsPro checked fine. Failed: Slight droop on left side during smile test, problems winking left eye, can hardly flare left nostril, I also felt tightness and a neck ache on my right neck which may have been compensating for defective left. No problems typing, speech a bit slurred.

Thought I could sleep it off and thought maybe it was a dental thing on my right side as it still felt like a fat lip on the right. 

Early morning next day, still dribbling water out of left, decided to Uber to ER. Described symptoms to reception screening nurse and said I might be having a TIA, did some simple strength/dexterity tests with my hands and arms and right away he said BP.

ER Dr exam, diagnosed BP, given Valacylovir, eye drops for dryness (along with paper tape in case I can‚Äôt keep my left eye closed) & Prednisone like the rest of you. Leaving ER the reception nurse asked me, ‚ÄòBP?‚Äô I said ‚Äòyes,‚Äô and he said that‚Äôs better than a stoke and I agreed. 

I figured out one thing on my own. To prevent dribbling drinks out of your mouth, use a straw, but USE IT ON THE AFFECTED SIDE. When you‚Äôre done sucking on the straw liquid will fall back down the straw, your strong non-straw side will prevent dribbling. Do it the other way and you will need a bib.",1,1760495704.0,BellsPalsy,2,1.0,False

I woke up to the sound of people screaming their hearts on a very very cold morning. I wanted to go to sleep.again but the situation had escalated further and now I was thinking if I ever was going to go down. I think they had it coming.

My neighbors the floor below me are a family of four. The house has four stories. I lived on the top floor. I don't have any problem with my apartment except for not having any toilets on the floor where I live. They used to do that sometimes but it hadn't been this loud. I'm sure half the neighborhood heard it and now gossips are gonna spread like wildfire. But that wasn't any of my concern. I had to go take a shit and it wasn't having it.

They stopped arguing. The old grandmother was mumbling something while the daughter in law kept quiet. Even if I didn't want to, I heard everything. I woke somewhere between "" you're never satisfied by my work"" and ""why don't you just throw me off a cliff"". The old grandfather kept quiet. He always did. But it must've been hard for him to be in such situations. To choose one side when you can't afford to choose. I had respected him more for that. From what I know, their grandchildren were abroad and only three of them lived there. 

I was at the end of my wits. As much as I hate being woken up early on a holiday, I had to do my business urgent. It's been twenty minutes since the argument stopped. Surely they've gone somewhere. I went down tiptoeing my way through. When I reached for the toilet door, I saw the grandfather looking up in the sky. The toilet was just opposite of the room at the balcony and if the door was open, the whole balcony was visible . I could see the old man standing in the sun looking at the sky. I couldn't phantom what his thoughts were and I left it at that.

After finishing my business I went back to my room. He was still standing at the balcony. I went to my room to make coffee hoping it would make my day better. Then my dad messaged me "" What happened between mom and grandmother?"".

I‚Äôve spent a good amount of time exploring both the famous spots and the lesser-known corners of Music City, and I‚Äôve found that the best experiences often happen once you step a few blocks away from the noise.

Here‚Äôs a mix of [classic highlights and under-the-radar gems that give you the full Nashville experience](https://jotzle.com/things-to-do-in-nashville-tennessee/):

  


**1. Explore Music Beyond Broadway**

* **Bluebird Caf√©**: This small venue in Green Hills is where many songwriters got their start. It‚Äôs intimate, quiet, and completely centered on the music.
* **Station Inn**: If you‚Äôre into bluegrass or roots music, this place is legendary. Shows here feel authentic and down-to-earth.
* **Third Man Records**: Jack White‚Äôs record label has a shop, live stage, and a quirky vibe that blends art and music culture.

  


**2. Eat Like a Local**

* **Hattie B‚Äôs or Prince‚Äôs Hot Chicken**: Yes, the line is long, but it‚Äôs part of the Nashville experience. Go for medium heat if you want flavor without tears.
* **The Pharmacy**: Great burgers and a nostalgic soda shop atmosphere.
* **Mas Tacos Por Favor**: A neighborhood favorite that serves some of the best tacos in the city.

  


**3. Take a Walk Through History**

* **The Johnny Cash Museum**: Small but full of fascinating memorabilia.
* **RCA Studio B Tour**: Learn about where Elvis and Dolly Parton recorded some of their biggest hits.
* **Belle Meade Historic Site & Winery**: A beautiful estate that combines history and wine tasting.

  


**4. Enjoy Nashville‚Äôs Outdoor Side**

* **Centennial Park**: Don‚Äôt miss the full-scale replica of the Parthenon. It‚Äôs quirky but worth seeing.
* **Radnor Lake State Park**: Peaceful trails just 20 minutes from downtown. Great for spotting wildlife.
* **Shelby Bottoms Greenway**: Ideal for biking or running with scenic river views.

  


**5. Experience the Neighborhoods**

* **12 South**: Boutiques, murals, and excellent coffee spots.
* **East Nashville**: Artsy, laid-back, and packed with independent restaurants and record stores.
* **The Gulch**: Trendy and polished, great for rooftop views and modern dining.

  


**Takeaway**

Nashville is far more than just country music and neon lights. It‚Äôs a city where creative energy seeps into every part of life, from its food to its community spaces. Whether you‚Äôre coming for a weekend or a week, mix in a few of these local spots with the must-sees and you‚Äôll leave with a much richer experience.

I‚Äôm looking to meet a fellow cinephile to catch films with and have long, thoughtful conversations afterward (in person or in chat). Someone who lives for film: classics, foreign, indie, prestige cinema, and even some silly stuff. I love dissecting themes, cinematography, and performances over coffee or drinks. 

About me: I have a literature degree (which explains my love of film analysis) and am a liberal feminist and atheist. I strive to always be kind, love to laugh, and have a snarky streak. I‚Äôm open minded and not easily offended (with the exception of bigotry). I click best with intelligent, introverted people who enjoy real conversation. 

I tend to get along better with men, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm posting F4M, but I‚Äôm not looking to date. I just want to meet someone who‚Äôs genuinely passionate about film. Men and nonbinary people of all orientations welcome, 30+ please. 

I‚Äôve got a kid, so my schedule varies, but I‚Äôm usually free a few nights a week and on weekends. And I‚Äôm always up for chatting about film in the meantime.

If this sounds like your kind of friendship, let‚Äôs trade favorite movies, directors, hot takes, and compare Letterboxd stats to see who‚Äôs got bigger film cred. üòÇ

1o6z4d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuckyBarnes/comments/1o6z4d4/my_bucky_in_a_relationship_headcanons/,My Bucky in a Relationship Headcanons,"I made another post titled give me your most niche bucky head canons and so many people had so many amazing ones that I figured that I would do a similar post but for relationships. Note that most of these head canons are based on the relationship he is in in one of my fanfics

Bucky's love language is Acts of Service and Quality time. In his relationship he shows his love by doing small things, making coffee before she gets up, fixing broken cabinets, restocking the fridge with food he knows she likes. Spending time is also another one of his favorites. It doesn't have to be anything grand or even exciting sometimes just sitting on the couch shoulders against the other while reading is enough. 

How Bucky shows love is through his actions. Yes he says ""I love you,"" but he always put something behind the words. He never wants I love you just to become a phrase. 

At first when Bucky wakes up from nightmares he goes distant even if all he wants is to be held and consoled. He struggles with the guilt believing he is not worthy of it and also the fear that he might lash out. However she knows to ask, ""Do you need a moment?"" always before reaching out. It gives him that second to breath. His response would depend on the nightmare, if it was one about losing her he would shake his head and allow her to move closer to him resting his head on her shoulder while she strokes his hair. If it was one of him being the Winter Soldier he would hesitate some times even getting up and leaving the room to create space since he thought that meant safety. Now as the relationship has progressed when Bucky wakes up from nightmares the first thing he does is A. make sure that he is fully himself, B. Do a scan of the room with his eyes and the almost instantly he then wraps his arms around her pulling her closer to him and burying his face in the nap of her neck. He now finds comfort in her being so close. Her presence reminds him where he is and that he is safe and no longer the Winter Soldier. 

Physical intimacy does not come till much later in the relationship. Even then Bucky never wants that to be the only way he shows her love. Love is always much more. 

Bucky is a gentlemen without having to think. Always holding open doors, always walking on the outside of the side walk and always offering his jacket.

He can be clingy in the mornings often roping his arms around her and mumbling for five more minutes. 

After coming back from a mission she is the first person he goes to sometimes claiming that he is going to stay a day back at the mission location only to fly back the same day as the rest of the team seperately so he can have a whole day with her. He feels bad for it up until she opens the door. Instantly he embraces her holding her close and falling into her arms. That night he always holds her even closer. 

When she cooks Bucky always helps. Always. He had three sisters and knows how to be helpful in the kitchen. He even is quiet the cook himself. Nothing flashy but homey. He used to help his mother to. He's always assisting and if he isn't doing that or if there is nothing for him to do he is wrapping his arms around her from behind perching his chin on her shoulder and watching her work even if it is something as dull as stirring soup. 

Always does the dishes especially if she did all the cooking. Sometimes they do it together but on the nights when she seems tired of stressed he refuses to let her touch a single dish. He actually enjoys it. It give him a sense of normal and can also be de stressing the simple movements of cleaning. 

Bucky was so against physical touch for so long because it only brought him pain that he is now touch starved. Its not flashy or dramatic. A simple holding of her hand or his hand resting over hers is enough. But he is a sucker when she combs and plays with his hair. 

Thats all I have for now I'd love to hear urs and ur thoughts (plz keep it appropriate) lol this is long sorry. ",4,1760495121.0,BuckyBarnes,0,0.83,False

I used faceseek and uploaded a current, tired decaf face pic.The results were strangee‚ò†Ô∏è.

1o6yyzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1o6yyzc/how_do_i_stop_making_my_life_a_confirmation_of_my/,How do I stop making my life a confirmation of my worst abuser's predictions?,"From the time I was very young, my mother told me I was meant to be alone, that I didn't seem to like other people, that I would never marry, never have kids. This all flew in the face of what I desired most: a family, lots of children, a large circle of friends, a happy life. As such, I've spent the majority of the last 43 years trying to forge connections with others, attain an education, build a career... and now I'm 43, unemployed even with a doctorate, single for the last almost 5 years (and before that, for 8), childless, friendless, broke and in tremendous debt, and living in a house I own, but that is literally falling apart. I managed to excel in academics, doing better than even the majority of my non-traumatized peers, but everything else is a total loss. Because of my nearly constant, abject loneliness, as well as other recent circumstances beyond my control, I've felt I had no choice but to remain in contact with my mother... despite the fact that she is still very, actively abusive. 

I feel like I've tried everything I could to meet potential friends and partners, but nothing works. Social groups? I've participated in all available, same with support groups. Church? I'm an omnist, so I don't really fit anywhere, but I've still attended several different religious institutions, and while people have been friendly, I've never even found so much as a coffee buddy. I've used dating apps galore and found a host of ghosters, posted personal ads in classifieds and found fwb situations but no relationships. I've made friends, at least in name, but people tend to either ghost or give excuses within a few months, and are gone. Currently, the only ""friend"" I have-- the only one who will converse with me on a regular basis-- is a long-term ex from years ago; she was horribly abusive during our relationship, so the only way our now text-based friendship works is that 11 years have passed since we were together, and she lives too far away for us to hang out in person. 

I'm just completely at my wits' end with all of this. The one positive is I have a therapist of 4 1/2 years with whom I have a very solid and trusting relationship; she, however, is at as much of a loss as I am, as to how I've ended up in this conundrum. I feel like, at 43, I'm nearly to the end of the time I could feasibly raise kids-- I'm a guy, but my body isn't in great shape and I fear I won't have the energy to chase around little kids for much longer-- and when I go on dating sites or check personal ads, none of the women in my age range have any interest in having kids, anyway. I guess posting here is my last-ditch attempt to get some suggestions as to how to counter the seeming inevitability that my life will always be exactly what my mother said it would be: the polar opposite of anything I ever wanted or that would make me remotely happy.
